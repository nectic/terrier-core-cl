Scottish viewers will miss out on the BBC's Question Time this week as
the current affairs programme is dropped north of the Border in favour
of its own Words With Wark.
The move is a significant one and was achieved by the executives at
Queen Margaret Drive only after some fierce negotiation with London.
The production heads of David Dimbleby's weekly political discussion
show are understood to be unhappy with the decision.
This latest opt out means that, once a month over an eight-month
period, Scottish viewers will not be able to see Question Time. Instead
they will see the similarly-formatted Words With Wark, hosted by Kirsty
Wark, which will deal exclusively with Scottish issues.
BBC insiders say Mr Dimbleby is furious, although he and his
production team have been forced to accept the situation.It was even
suggested that Question Time might attempt to steal the thunder from the
Wark programme by making sure that there were headline-grabbing
politicians on the panel during the Scottish opt-out weeks.
BBC Scotland, however, stressed that they had discussed the
arrangements with Question Time in order to ensure interests did not
clash.
On the face of it, BBC Scotland has gone against a hard-and-fast edict
from Director General John Birt that all network current affairs
programmes from London should be broadcast simultaneously throughout the
nation. However, Mr Birt had also expressed his desire to see an
increase in the entertainment programme quota in each area.
Because of BBC Scotland's unique ''national region'' status, it makes
more local current affairs programmes than other areas of the UK. This
has often meant that, in order to accommodate programmes like Words With
Wark, Axiom, and Frontline, it has been forced to drop other networked
shows, shows which have usually been entertainment-based.
The Scottish executives have tried several different formulas in a bid
to solve the scheduling problem. They broadcast the last series of Words
With Wark on a Monday evening. But it followed directly after Panorama
which meant that two heavyweight current affairs programmes ran back to
back and, as a result, a networked entertainment programme was dropped.
Now BBC Scotland has successfully argued that the best solution for
Words With Wark, an eight-edition series which will go out once every
four weeks, is to drop Question Time once a month. They have also
discussed the arrangement in detail with the Question Time team in order
to ensure that they do not double up with Scottish issues or Scottish
venues.
BBC Scotland knows, however, that the English programme has a very
devoted (and influential) audience North of the Border and it is
preparing itself for the inevitable complaints.
The move is being described at Queen Margaret Drive as ''purely a
scheduling matter.''
Kirsty Wark, who will front the Scottish programme, said: ''This is a
great slot for the programme. We are very pleased. It was always
difficult in the last series to play on a Monday night after Panorama. I
am delighted with the new arrangements.''

Joe Donnelly tells how the Scottish company can weave through the web
to new business.
JONATHAN Hart predicts that by the year 2000 more than 750 million
people will be using the Internet. ''That's a staggering amount of
people, world-wide. And that's only four years away. Four short years,''
he says.
''People have to realise that this Internet explosion will affect
everybody. It's going to open up vast markets, and when the world's
major players, BT, United Artists and other top companies are putting
their muscle behind it, it has to be important.''
All this might sound like a latter-day prophet's voice in the
wilderness. Jonathan Hart may be making forecasts, but from no
wilderness. His job is to lead businesses out of the backwoods and the
tall timber on to the smooth flow of the information superhighway. He's
the man behind Voice, the Caledonian Information and Media Service
dedicated Internet and multimedia business which was launched on October
24.
Voice is Europe's first commercial turnkey operation to connect
companies with the World Wide Web and that huge market Hart describes.
On the same day as the service went web-wide, the Bank of Scotland's
presence was established on the Internet through the Voice system. It is
the world's biggest banking interactive site and is available to anyone
with a computer and modem connection.
After a couple of decades of being an academic's link and then a
computer curiosity, the Internet has moved out of the technical
environment and it's becoming a serious commercial tool. How serious is
reflected by Hart's assessment of the vast number of users in the next
four years. More companies are looking at it as a vital part of their
marketing strategy, but demand is now outstripping the ability of small
service companies to cope. It is now up to information providers to
change up to the bigger market. Internet access will probably be soon
given away free as part of a package from supply companies like cable
and TV and entertainment businesses.
However, there are scores of traditional design houses, television pre
and post-production suites and all manner of niche marketing businesses
who alone cannot bridge the gap into the Internet market.
Voice is that bridge. It is a one-stop shop for companies who want to
go on line, and it is the first dedicated Internet service in the UK and
the first in Europe to offer a complete turnkey package to start the
engine for access to the superhighway.
The Internet connection is also the bridge to the future, according to
Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian Publishing, whose titles
include The Herald and the Evening Times. He said: ''We believe that a
significant part of the company's future marketing strategy must lie in
the electronic distribution of information. At CIMS we are blending
marketing, editorial and design skills with the IT expertise we have
built up at Caledonian Publishing and making it available to the
business community.''
The expertise means that companies can buy what they need, from advice
to service, to information, to access.
''You don't buy a printing press when you want to make a colour
brochure,'' says Hart, Caledonian's managing director. ''You tell
experts what you want, and they provide the expertise. Except we don't
just do brochures. We do animations and graphics and three-dimensional
imaging. Everything required of the Internet, that's within our sphere
of expertise. We have faith in the future because we realise the
potential of this technology.
''The Internet is a true multi media. It has video, sound, animation
and real interactivity. We believe companies will look for multi media
access on the Internet. We are building the foundation of companies who
will take advantage of the vast new medium.
''Voice is a provider of Internet access and much more besides. We
have built a multi media design studio which provides the skills of
special programming, traditional TV production, two dimensional design
and computer gaming design. Allied to that we have a specialist sales
force who completely understand the medium. We have training departments
and facilities as a one-stop shop for businesses.''
How does it work? ''Businesses who are thinking about the Internet and
information superhighway will get specialist advice. Voice will take
their advertising and marketing staff, educate them as to what the
business opportunities are on the Internet. We will empower these
departments and other revenue-generating departments and give them the
key to the information highway. We will let them use and exploit it.
''We sit down and assess what they want and then we design the whole
package. We register their company on the Internet. Their presence
resides here and we manage it 24 hours a day. We then develop market
information on the uses of the site and we can build for any company a
comprehensive database about themselves, their customers and their
products.
''Because of the phenomenal expansion of Internet use, companies will
have to move very fast to be in on the ground floor. We see it as a real
tool. Firms will be able to trade on a global scale and the market is
limitless. There are no boundaries. The key is to be able to make sense
of the information. That's where database design comes in. We give
companies detailed statistics of who their customers are, which products
are more popular, where and with whom. As a result their presence
becomes dynamic, and not static.
''The Internet need no longer be like opening a book and looking
through pages. We will make it come alive with graphics and animations
and very high production. For one customer we have designed full
computer animation of how their product works. This facility alone
allows institutions to be able to download the information and have a
full 3-D animation running on their own PC. That's an amazing marketing
tool.
''Our client companies don't have to do anything. They needn't hire
extra staff or consultants, recruit design skills or purchase equipment
to design or maintain their site. We do all that.
''We have the best artists. We have taken on the best people for their
particular roles. We have our own editorial team of three journalists
who can inject life into copy. We have the technical staff of the
highest calibre and we draw on the expertise of 45 information
technology experts employed by our parent company Caledonian
Publishing.''
As an example of what can be achieved, or demonstrated to global
markets hooked into the borderless Internet, the Bank of Scotland site,
on line on the same day as Voice, is prime. It will be the biggest bank
on an Internet site in the world. Customers can browse for themselves
through all the services and facilities, from loans to charges and
mortgages. Students can access what interests them. They can apply
on-line for information or even open accounts. All of the website pages
are protected by the most sophisticated encryption systems to ensure
total security. All of this done at the click of a mouse button on a
home PC screen.

ENGINEERING industry leaders yesterday forecast around 20,000 job cuts
in the next 12 months, despite continued output growth.
Engineering production will expand by 3% in the next year, according
to the Engineering Employers' Federation's twice-yearly economic trends
report.
But this masks a wide variation between industries, with the computer
and electronic sectors expected to expand strongly by 7% and metal
products to stagnate.
Employment, after rising by 2% in the first half of this year, has now
levelled off at 1.77 million and is set to fall to 1.75 million during
the next 12 months, says the EEF.

BUTTE Mining today launched a #100m-plus claim against subsidiaries of
Simon Engineering for alleged fraudulent activities.
The case relates to the Robertson Group of companies, which are now
subsidiaries of Simon and which acted as promoters and technical experts
to Butte as well as vendors of mining sites.
The claim alleges that the vendors of those properties made secret
profits when they received shares in Butte with a value of #49.5m on its
flotation in 1987 and #50m in 1988.
Butte said it had also suffered #11.3m losses in attempting to mine
the sites.

We've all heard of the information super highway, but does anyone
really know what it's for? Richard Longhurst, editor of .net, Britain's
best-selling Internet magazine, explains how the information revolution
can benefit your business
THE supergeeks at Nerd Central have been telling us that the
information superhighway is here to stay, and that by the end of the
century there'll be more people on the Internet than there are on the
planet. Over the past year, a couple of dedicated Internet magazines has
turned into a handful and the number of Internet access providers in the
UK has shot up from twenty-something to sixty-something.
The trouble is, among all the jargon and technobabble, it's hard to
work out what the Internet actually means to your business -- how does
it directly affect you, and, more to the point, how can you actually
find customers, cut costs and earn money using it? This super
information nonsense is all very interesting in a half-hour BBC2
documentary kind of way, but as yet, the chances are that nobody's taken
the time to tell you how to get some hard benefits from the largest
computer network in the world. At times it seems that the only sure-fire
way of making money from the Internet is to run a seminar that purports
to tell people how to make money from the Internet, but over the past
year, many companies, large and small, have benefited from doing
business on-line.
OK, so you need a degree in technical wizardry to understand how the
damn thing works, but all that talk of UNIX, SLIPS, PoPs, and TCP/IP
dial-ups is largely irrelevant when it comes to looking at how the
Internet can benefit your business. When you instal a new phone in your
office, you don't care how the switchboard works, you just hire a boffin
to do all the technical stuff. So don't worry about how it all glues
together (there are enough technonerds out there who can plug it all in
for you), turn your mind to what you can do with it, and to what it can
do for you.
Exploiting the power of the Net for business can be a very gradual
process.
Any company that already has IBM-compatible PCs or Apple Macintosh
computers can start using the Internet for a very small initial outlay.
All you need to get connected is a modem that links your computer to the
phone line (a decent model will cost around #150) and an account with an
Internet service provider which will cost from around #15 a month. For
this you'll get an e-mail address and access to a plethora of on-line
information resources including the World Wide Web and discussion
groups.
Not all companies can afford to pay for extensive market research, but
the Internet can help you do it for free, and sometimes by accident. The
discussion groups (often called newsgroups) are places where people get
together to discuss their favourite topics -- it could be feet, it could
be Bay Watch, it could be your products or a market you're interested
in. A browse through the relevant groups quickly reveals what people
think of the latest offerings, and the sooner you have the information,
the sooner you can act on it.
These resources are useful for helping you find out about other
people, companies and their products, but for potential customers and
partners to find out about your business, you need your own World Wide
Web site. There are essentially two ways of setting one up. The hard
(and most expensive) way is to rent a direct connection to the Internet,
buy a hefty Internet server and hire some boffins to connect it all up
and produce the pages for the Web site. Estimated cost in the first
year: #40,000. But it's only worth doing this if yours is a large
company that's absolutely committed to the Internet throughout the
organisation.
Future Publishing's approach to the Internet is an excellent example
of the benefits and costs of this route. Within a year, the company's
FutureNet Web site has become the busiest in Europe, with 50,000 people
now visiting it every week, but it takes five full-time employees to
keep the site up to date and ahead of the competition.
An easier (and much cheaper) way of setting up a Web site is to rent
space on an Internet service provider's computer and either code the
pages yourself or hire a design agency to do them for you. Estimated
cost in the first year: #1000. In fact, it doesn't even have to cost
that much. In conjunction with Forth Valley Enterprise, the Trade
Development Centre in Falkirk (01324 622744) has established a Web site
that aims to promote exports from small and medium sized companies in
the area. Any business in the Forth Valley can use the service to set up
its own presence in the World Wide Web for free.
In the same way that you book adverts in magazines, space on
billboards, and air time on TV and radio, your Web site is your
company's permanent on-line promotion. Of course, people are going to be
a trifle peeved if they spend time and money downloading a file to find
that it's just one of your adverts, but there are ways of getting your
message across without annoying the users.
One of the best methods is to give them something for free to make
them like your company, and at the same time tell them about your
products. For example, Guinness has successfully promoted its black brew
by offering a free screen saver to all and sundry who visit its Web
site, and McEwan's has an on-line football service where you can go to
find out the latest news and gossip.
Forms can be used to capture details about who is accessing the site,
so you can readily assess their demographic profile, something that
can't easily be done with print, radio or television advertising. Within
the confines of the Data Protection Act, you can link the data captured
on-line to your existing customer database or start building a new one.
One of the grooviest things about the Net is that these people
cruising around in cyberspace give you a self-selected target market.
They're keen computer users, they've got money to spend on their hobby,
which means they've got money to spend on other products as well. The
typical profile of an Internet user is a professional employed ABC1
male, so if you're on the Internet too, then you're tapping straight in
to a rich vein of potential customers.
Not only can you put up information about current products and
services, with text, pictures, sound and even video, you can have order
forms that can be filled in on-line. Name, address, credit card number
and you're away. Security is obviously an issue when customers are asked
to enter sensitive financial details into an unknown system, but the
Internet industry has already come up with secure payment systems the
mind-boggling complexity of which will put off even the most hardened
computer hacker.
The Internet is also a resource for giving after-sales services that
have a high perceived value for the customer, but which aren't
necessarily expensive to provide. As well as answering technical queries
by phone, support staff can solve problems via e-mail -- if nothing
else, it should clear up the phone lines for more sales enquiries.
Apart from actually enabling your company to sell more products, the
Internet can speed up office communications. Electronic mail is an
incredibly powerful medium and once you've got it, you won't be able to
live without it. You can send electronic documents anywhere in the world
for just a few pence, and they take minutes rather than days to arrive.
So whether you need to keep in contact with suppliers, customer or
salesmen in the field, e-mail is a must.
This has really only scratched the surface of what's possible, and as
Future Publishing has discovered with its new Internet system FutureNet,
as soon as you start exploring the scope of the Net, you quickly realise
there are some extremely powerful things just waiting to be done. So do
them, because while you're busy pooh-poohing this whole thing as just a
flash in the pan, your competitors will be finding ways to make it make
money for them at your expense.

Internet magazine.

NETWORK hardware product of the year; hot product of the year; number
one in manufacturing performance; first in user-satisfaction rating;
ranked in the top 100 fastest growing international companies.
These are all accolades for Cabletron Systems who installed the new
network at Caledonian Information and Media Services to provide the
group with the complex infrastructure and put it at the European cutting
edge of the information superhighway to develop its existing and future
business.
The Cabletron switching and fibre-optic technology enables CIMS to
provide the complete turnkey package, a one-stop-shop open door to the
Internet which offers companies and corporations access to the new and
potentially vast world-wide market.
Twelve years ago, it was a two-man part-time operation working out of
a garage. Since then, founders Robert Levine and Craig Benson have
transformed Cabletron Systems Inc into the leading hub manufacturer of
the Local Area Networking (LAN) industry. It has now evolved into a
$753m corporation with close to 5000 employees world-wide.
Cabletron's commitment to its customers has fuelled the corporation's
success as a world leader in the development and manufacture of
intelligent wiring hubs and network management software for LANs. With a
no-frills corporate philosophy, Cabletron is able to offer the
industry's broadest line of products at lower costs, allowing customers
to tailor their networks to individual needs.
Cabletron, who went public in 1989, manufactures the industry's
broadest LAN connectivity product line. In the past three years alone,
revenues have leapt from just under $300m to more that $800m, with a net
income more than tripled to #162m.
Scots sales director Fred Salmond says: ''Our task was to provide
Caledonian Information and Media Service with the means to allow them to
process all the information that passes through the organisation.
''Caledonian is in the at ground level and the business opportunities
they have opened up for themselves are truly enormous. Cabletron, being
a world leader in this technology are very keen to be part of this
success and delighted to have partnered CIMS in this venture.''
The company provided the network infrastructure within Caledonian,
intelligent switching and fibre optic cables for information
transmission.
Fred Salmond explains: ''We have installed a number of intelligent
multi-media access centre hubs to support the fast fibre backbone which
is capable of processing data across the network at 100 megabits per
second. For the actual user we provide a 10 megabit per second service
on switched Ethernet.''
In lay terms, the Ethernet is a shared access facility which processes
information at 10 megabits per second, spread among a number of users.
The switched Ethernet system gives that facility to each user, offering
a huge amount of processing power to one individual.
In the past few years, Cabletron has forced the pace of evolution in
switching technology with a number of technological achievements
including its development of the ESX-1320, a 12-port stand alone
Ethernet switch designed for high-performance workgroups. Earlier this
year, they unveiled seven new high-speed LAN switches deployable across
Cabletron's MMAC and MMAC-Plus family of switching hub.
It also developed Synthesis, the company's strategic framework of
products, support services and technologies that combine to migrate
users from traditional router-based internetworks to emerging,
switch-based, virtual networks, and they announced a suite of ATM
products that are the first to allow customers to seamlessly integrate
existing network infrastructures including Ethernet and Token Ring with
an ATM enterprise.

THOSE of us who shrank back in our seats when the tyrannosaurus burst
through the fence and who held our breath while the raptor hunted the
kids through Jurassic Park can thank Silicon Graphics for some of the
most amazing digital animations ever seen in a movie.
The computerised reincarnation of the most fearsome carnosaurs after
67 million years was just one of the electronic tricks in the company's
repertoire. The dinosaurs may have become extinct, but Silicon Graphics
is one of the fastest evolving companies in the history of
micro-processing.
In just over a decade since it was founded, Silicon Graphics has been
honing the razor edge of the technology to produce some of the fastest
microprocessing yet achieved and many of the most innovative graphics
solutions.
The company has made its own milestones since it was founded as a
start-up venture back in 1982. Today its WebFORCE software environment
is the key to the World Wide Web access of Caledonian Information and
Media Services VOICE. It is what makes the information highway
super-fast.
''Our mission is to inspire dramatic change in what users expect from
their computers,'' said chairman Edward McCracken, ''thus allowing
people to create, capture and communicate their ideas as never before.''
A fair enough aim. Over the past decade or so, Silicon Graphics has
been at the forefront of the industry, leading with advances in
technology that have altered the way we develop, communicate and
interact with information. Some of these advances make it possible to
express ideas at enormous speed and precision, and visually too.
Silicon Graphics technology is visual computing, a vital ingredient of
interaction on the World Wide Web. According to the company, VC is the
ability to work interactively with a computer-generated model of a
product or concept using true colour three-dimensional moving objects on
screen and to simulate and even predict characteristics of the real
world.
The company's brief but trailblazing history to date has taken it from
a small starter to a major player, employing 5400 people from 56
international points. It is recognised by Dataquest as the third largest
workstation vendor and the fourth largest supercomputer trader in the
world. Now the CIMS VOICE is using that power to give Scots companies a
prestige position on the Internet.
Silicon has provided the processing power for Industrial Light and
Magic Animation, for Walt Disney's real time location animation, and
even conceptual design for Levi Strauss. Added to the foregoing is the
expertise Silicon Graphics has on the World Wide Web. WebFORCE is the
first product line for creating and service media-rich content on the
web. The new systems help Voice in building companies presence on the
WWW and improve the information access across the whole of their
enterprises.
The WebFORCE system at the heart of Voice at Caledonian Information
and Media Services offers automated interactive site services without
the haze of technical confusion. The Silicon Graphics software
environment provides the facility to create, capture, edit and combine
digital media from images to movies, models and structured text.
A site can be configured with secure communications, allowing on-line
transactions, exchange of confidential documents and trading. Also
included in the new Voice service is the Silicon Graphics Netscape
Navigator, the leading browser for exploration and site confirmation. It
also comes with VRML, a virtual reality modelling language, an advanced
technology for publishing three-dimensional objects and scenes on the
web, and enriches any Internet site.
If the Internet is to be the medium of the future, as an information
autobahn, as a trading post, as a virtual reality showcase, the powerful
technologies developed by Silicon Graphics are what keeps the Internet
engines running on turbo. They are what opens the first entire Turnkey
Package in Europe, the Voice CIMS window to the web.

THE design of the network to provide the required high level of access
to Caledonian Information and Media Services' remote users was carried
out by the IT development staff at the company's Glasgow headquarters,
working closely with network design specialists from Motorola ISG,
industry leader in the high-speed modern market.
Motorola's innovative technology allows vast amounts of data to be
squeezed down low-speed, low-cost circuits, whether over dial-up phone
lines for home users accessing the Internet, or over corporate data
networks for business.
It was decided early on to opt for V.34 modern technology. Alasdair
Rhodes, ISG's business development manager, explains how the CIMS system
operates.
''V.34 is a relatively new international specification which allows
data to be transferred over standard telephone lines at 28,800bps (bits
per second) -- twice the speed of the previous V.32bis standard. With
the data compression software included in the Motorola modems, the
actual data rate to the user increases to 115,000bps.
''The remote user is provided with a Motorola 3400 Online package,
which consists of V.34 modem and PC software. The software includes an
animated installation disk to allow easy installation and configuration
of hardware and software.
''Once the software is installed, the user clicks an icon on the PC
screen which automatically causes the modem to dial the central bank of
modems at CIMS in Glasgow. At the central site are Motorola 3267
top-of-the-range chassis-mounted V.34 modems. Each Modulus chassis has
21 slots which hold the dual 3267 cards, giving a total capacity of 42
modems per rack.
''A PC-based modem management system will manage up to 23 racks, or
960 modems. The advantage of the managed rack-mount modem is that it
saves space, and if a fault occurs on an individual modem or line then
it can be taken out of service to prevent the next user dialling in and
connecting to it.
''The central modems are connected to a Motorola BitRunr. This is a
gateway that converts from the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) used
by the modems to TCP/IP which is the universal language used by the Sun
Servers and the Internet.
''Once the connection has been made, the user can browse through the
information on the CIMS Sun Servers, or connect to the Internet using
the PC software provided with the Motorola 3400 Online. The overall
effect is as though the remote user is directly connected to the CIMS
LAN (local area network).
''For corporate users who wish to have multiple remote connections,
there is the option of high-speed connections via fixed router links,
using either Motorola 6500 Routers or existing routers which will
communicate with the Motorola equipment using the international Frame
Relay standard.''
Motorola Information Systems Group is a key division within Motorola
at Easter Inch, where business manager Alasdair Rhodes leads the local
team -- sales co-ordinator Caroline Stanford, network design consultant
Mike Garvie, and Jim Connelly, technical support engineer.
ISG, formerly known as Codex, is the largest modem manufacturer in the
world. It supplies network products, including LAN/WAN internetworking
products, through international subsidiaries and an established
distributor organisation in 52 countries.
The company is a world-wide leader in optimising networks through
intelligent connections based on innovative software and superior design
skills. It helps to create industry standards through participation in
more than 30 national and international standard bodies, including ANSI,
ITU (CCITT), IEEE, ISO/OSI and NBS.
The company's high level of investment in advanced research and
development is demonstrated by the fact that ISG-developed technologies
have pioneered virtually every analogue transmission speed breakthrough
over the past 15 years. The standard for the Frame Relay high-speed
digital access protocol is also built on ISG-developed technology.
Performance is one of two key reasons for Motorola's success in the
voice and data communications industry: the other is product quality.
ISG is well within reach of its quality-assurance goal of Six Sigma --
which translates to fewer than 3.4 defects per million parts. In
comparison, most networking companies are currently operating at Four
Sigma, or about 6200 defects per million parts.
The company's customers range from small and medium-sized firms to
multi-national organisations with global enterprise networks. Motorola
ISG helps them achieve the greatest value and productivity from their
computer systems and common carrier facilities by providing superior
products and systems that effectively monitor and control corporate
networks.
Customers in the UK include: Abbey National, American Express, BT,
Bass Brewers, British Airways, Fisons, ICL, London Stock Exchange,
Mobil, Post Office, Rank Xerox, Reuters, Shell and the TSB.
Service is critical to the networking solution, and ISG offers a range
of network management services that addresses every stage in the life
cyle of a network -- from design and installation to management and
facilities management.
The company's network design experts help customers to configure,
install and support voice and data networks world-wide. This often
includes integrating multiple technologies and simultaneous
implementation in dozens -- or even hundreds -- of sites throughout the
world.
Motorola ISG also analyses existing customer networks and suggests
design improvements to support business objectives. It will obtain,
integrate and administer non-ISG products, as well as carrier
facilities, to provide full network integration.
If required, the company will manage the network around the clock and
around the world.

Bank of Scotland has a site on the Internet, Joan Grady explains how
it plans to use this facility
NEVER a company to shy away from technology, the Bank of Scotland has
recently launched, with the help of Caledonian Information and Media
Services, a new information site on the Internet. Iain Fiddes, director
of marketing services and public relations, explained why the bank
decided to get connected.
''The whole thing is very dynamic,'' he said. ''Initially we looked at
it as another channel through which to promote our products by giving
details on a selection of them and making many people aware of our
e-mail address.
''We don't do anything transactional because at the moment security
isn't tight enough. But as people become more adept on and aware of the
Internet it opens another important channel in product information.''
Placing product information on the net is a less obtrusive way of
marketing and, thinks Fiddes, a beneficial one to the marketing company.
''The attraction is that people can inquire in their own time, we're
not forcing our marketing on them at a time when they can't pay any
attention,'' he said. ''So they're more likely to request information
from us.''
He stresses, however, that the bank is not backing away from
advertising, that all the media it uses are still ''very much in play''.
The Internet simply offers a gentler approach which can yield more
definite results -- if readers don't have too long to wait for
information.
''We wanted a situation where information can be downloaded quickly on
to the screen,'' said Fiddes, ''So we didn't want too many fancy
graphics. People looking for information from us want just the details
and could get fed up waiting for pretty pictures to emerge.''
True to its reputation for using technology, the Bank of Scotland had
an established presence on the net before they decided to collaborate
with CIMS.
In fact, it was the first Scottish bank to have a presence on the net,
and although that presence was small-scale it was enough to convince the
marketers that they could do more.
''We were aware of CIMS and we asked them for a presentation,'' said
Fiddes. ''What was put over to us with a high degree of professionalism
-- most of our questions were answered before they were asked.
''They had done their homework, thought about what we might use the
Internet for and presented that to us.''
From small beginnings the bank has grown its presence. With the help
of CIMS it produced a more detailed package, which Fiddes thinks gives
it a greater edge.
''It's like a starter for 10,'' he said. ''We've got information on
maybe half-a-dozen product ranges up there.''
Working with CIMS makes sure the information is displayed to maximum
effect. While the bank supplies the information, CIMS turns it into a
useable format.
''CIMS design the information and keep it updated for us,'' said
Fiddes. ''Liaison is mostly manual at the moment; we write out roughly
what we want and they put it together for us.
''It means we're getting the 'hot words' in the right places and so
on. They understand what we're trying to do and 'jargonise' it for us so
people can access the information they want.''
The results of the initial stage have been impressive. Already the
bank has had several hundred inquiries about its products.
''Inquiries come into CIMS and are sent to the bank. Names and
addresses of people inquiring are printed out and we answer inquiries
individually from that.''
For the moment the bank has no plans to use CIMS' market analysis
capabilities, preferring to formulate its own strategy to begin with.
Fiddes agrees, however, that it would be a useful service to help form
that strategy.
''The initial exercise was just to be there and it's now up to us to
assess how to be more targeted and more responsive,'' he said. ''We
could be interested in using marketing analyses in the future, as they
could help us to fine tune our strategy.
''As a simple example, if we say there are two types of people out
there, As and Bs, and we know that 85% of inquiries were coming from As
we would condition how we put our message over to suit them.''
Like many others, Fiddes has been surprised by the sudden popularity
as a business tool of something which not so long ago was seen as about
as exciting as trainspotting on a wet Sunday.
He recognises, however, that it still has a way to go. ''It's a
long-term and developing method,'' he said. ''Five years ago who would
have said it would be such a respectable way of doing business?''
CIMS is a client-led organisation. It researches what clients will
need on the net and makes suggestions based on that. It helps the client
develop an interesting and informative package, using expertise in
writing, design and marketing to get exactly the right combination for
the client.
The final decision on everything, right down to the time of the
launch, is, however, left to the client. Bank of Scotland had many other
areas to consider apart from deciding what information to include, and
CIMS worked to its specifications.
''CIMS was driven very much by our timing,'' said Fiddes. ''We began
talking about it in May, and it could have been ready sooner than now,
but CIMS had to take its timing from us.
''We had all sorts of official checks to carry out before the material
could be distributed, so although it took five months it could have been
a lot less. All the timeframes set between ourselves and CIMS were met.
''As a prime name we do have needs that have to be met, so we are a
demanding client -- but in the nicest way.''
Like most others, Fiddes sees the opportunities represented by the
Internet, but has no plans to use it exclusively. ''This would
complement other forms of marketing,'' he said. ''I don't see it taking
over.''

FOR a company with the title Caledonian, situated in that belt of the
country popularly known as Silicon Glen, it can be viewed as not
entirely inappropriate that the solution to its information technology
needs should be provided in Scotland.
When CIMS approached IT specialists Simmons Magee with a requirement
for the design, installation and configuration of a series of Internet
services for its clients, a chain of events was set in motion which led
to the historic West Lothian burgh of Linlithgow.
Here lies the European operations nerve centre of Sun Microsystems,
the global corporation which pioneered the Internet and remains at the
forefront of its development.
The Scottish office of Simmons Magee, one of the UK's top 10 resellers
specialising in providing IT services to large organisations, brought in
Sun as its partner to put together the complex package of hardware and
software needed to make up the VOICE installation.
''The success of Simmons Magee in Scotland is in part due to our staff
who recognise that Scottish customers often have different requirements
to their English counterparts,'' says Richard Kenny, regional manager,
Scotland.
''In selecting Sun for this project we knew that CIMS was benefiting
from the strongest partnership possible.''
At the heart of the system is seven Sun Netra 20 Internet Servers, the
powerful ''gateway'' equipment which enables users to gain access to the
network.
The installation also includes a package of sophisticated software
which includes Solstice Firewall -- 1, designed by Sun to protect
systems from interference by hackers.
The scale of Sun's involvement in the Internet can be measured by the
fact that the company has supplied more than half of all the net servers
installed throughout the world. And 75% of all Internet applications
were developed using Sun technology.
Sun leads the world in turning the Internet into a viable business
tool. The Netra Internet Server provides complete and easy to install
hardware and software that gives simple and secure access without
requiring an in-depth knowledge of the operating system.
Sun applications, however, extend beyond business to education and
public service projects. For example, the first serious use of the
Internet by Herald football writers was at the World Cup finals in the
US last year.
The continuing development of the Internet bodes well for the future
of Sun's Scottish plant.
''We expect the Internet to be at the forefront of electronic
enterprise in the decades to come,'' says Scott McNealy, the
corporation's chairman and chief executive.
And he predicts: ''With the tools we are making available, users in
business to business settings can begin conducting electronic commerce
now. Within the next few years, business to consumer electronic commerce
could begin to replace much of the world's existing business
infrastructure.
Caledonian Information and Media Services approached Simmons Magee
with a requirement for the design, installation and configuration of a
WEB network infrastructure to provide a new series of services for its
clients via the World Wide Web.
A key to the Scottish success story has been through the use of
Simmons Magee innovative supply chain management system. This system
enables customers to pick and choose from the Simmons Magee core
services on offer, ranging from consultancy through to actual
installation, building a solution dependent on the customers needs.
Within those core services Simmons Magee is able to offer unbiased
advice regarding software and hardware selection through its partnership
agreements with more than 16 major hardware and software manufacturers.
The Sun Netra Internet Server manages the Internet connection in a
single integrated hardware and software system. With more than half of
the Internet already running through Sun servers, this system has an
unrivalled pedigree. Its scalable, modular design provides for simple
addition of users as they extend Internet access within the
organisation.
An intuitive and accessible user interface provides full support for
e-mail, file transfer and browsing of the graphical World Wide Web
system. Optional authoring tools give the ability to design ''home
pages'' to promote and support an organisation's products and services
to customers and other Internet clients.
Protection against unauthorised or potentially harmful access and
downloads can be provided by Firewall Software such as SunSoft's
Firewall-1, which combine the high security of an application-level
gateway with the efficiency of packet-level filtering.

ONE Cabinet Minister not seen promenading along the front at Blackpool
earlier this month with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury was
Scotland's own Michael Forsyth.
Mr William Waldegrave came back from breathing the sea air to boast
that every time he took a spending Minister for a stroll he wiped
another #100m off spending projections for next year, as they accepted
that there was still some fat left to trim from their departmental
budgets.
However, since the late 1970s the Scottish Secretary (and his Welsh
and Northern Ireland counterparts) has not had to go in to bat against
an aggressive Treasury attack because a formula decides his financial
fate.
While it would be no surprise if English Tory back-bench pressure was
brought to bear on this formula, it seems unlikely that a drastic change
will be imposed at this stage.
For one thing, it would leave Mr Forsyth hopelessly out on a limb.
Just three weeks after taking over at the Scottish Office, he was asked
by The Herald about pressures within the Conservative Party to cut
budgets so that funding north of the Border was the same per capita as
in the South.
His reply, on July 26 and reported the following day, could not have
been more clear: ''I feel that would be over my dead body. That's what I
feel. The expenditure that we get for Scotland is based on need and if
people want to argue about that expenditure, we'll let them argue
whether or not that is justified.''
Mr Forsyth's promise to ''fight like tigers to argue our corner'' may
not be called on, in terms of defending the existence of a funding
formula, but he may have to fight to prevent its partial erosion.
When the same question was put to the Chancellor by The Herald on
October 2, he also ruled out radical change in the settlement.
''We do have a basic understanding about how we allocate money for
Scotland and personally I have no intention of going back on that,
neither does the Government,'' he said.
''There is a formula, there is an understanding, and my discussions
with Michael Forsyth and William Waldegrave's discussions with him are
on that basis. Any English Conservative member who raises a change --
forget it. We are not moving to per capita.''
However, there were hints that the formula could face amendment. He
said: ''We could consider convergence over the long term,'' adding that
he thought ''Scotland does very well out of the deal''.
The irony is that the Barnett formula, as devised in 1979 after a
period of SNP upsurge, was actually designed to lower Scotland's
spending share towards that same aim of convergence with the English
level, specifying that Scotland would receive 10.76% of any increase or
decrease in the share allocated to London ministries.
A problem was that Scotland's population continued to fall and, as a
result, the per capita figure tended to rise. This was why Mr Michael
Portillo, during his stint as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in
November 1992 cut the formula to 10.66%.
The SNP has been quick to point out that Scotland's population is
officially 10.7% the size of England's and may actually be higher than
that since many young Scots removed themselves from the census data at a
time when they were fleeing the poll tax.

SNP leader Alex Salmond has challenged the Prime Minister on whether
he has plans to help Scots pensioners, in view of the #50 rebate being
given to electricity consumers in England and Wales .He said pensioners
in Scotland and Northern Ireland would be at a severe disadvantage if
electricity customers south of the Border received the rebate following
the sale of the National Grid.
In the first place, they would not be receiving the rebate to help
with their heating bills, despite the fact that the Grid was originally
a public asset.
Further, they already paid more for electricity than the rest of the
UK -- in 1994-95, Scottish pensioners paid #6.40 a week, compared with a
UK average of #5, according to the SNP figures.
Thirdly, pensions and pension increases from next year could be based
on a Retail Price Index figure which takes into account a rebate that
people in Scotland and Northern Ireland did not receive.
Mr Salmond said: ''It looks as though the Government has once again
overlooked the needs of Scotland's pensioners in a bid to bribe the
electorate south of the Border.''
He wants to know whether Scotland and Northern Ireland were considered
when these maters arose, whether the rebate now will be extended to
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and whether the rebate will be excluded
from the RPI to ensure there is no impact on future pension increases.
Mr Salmond said he wanted the situation to be clarified as swiftly as
possible, adding: ''It would be an astonishing injustice if Scots were
penalised by a rebate paid out in England and Wales.''

By Our Parliamentary
Correspondent
LIBERAL Democrat MP Malcolm Bruce claimed last night there had been an
''explosive'' rise in fraud cases and misappropriated funds at the
Ministry of Defence.
Mr Bruce, MP for Gordon, said that written answers he had received
showed that in 1992-93 there were 54 cases of fraud, compared with 207
cases in 1994-95.
In 1991, the amount of money misappropriated was #63,000, of which a
third was recovered. In 1994-95, the sum rose to almost #1.1m, of which
just 10% was recovered.
Mr Bruce said last night: ''These fraud figures confirm the MoD's
status as the most incompetent ministry in Whitehall. I will be tabling
further questions tomorrow to establish why this has happened and what
action has been taken.
''This information also calls into question the Treasury's report on
departmental fraud, which reported a mere #1.7m of fraud in all
Governmental departments in 1993-94.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond has challenged the Prime Minister on whether
he has plans to help Scots pensioners, in view of the #50 rebate being
given to electricity consumers in England and Wales following the sale
of the National Grid.
THE Government last night urged Iran to give ''satisfactory
assurances'' on the safety of author Salman Rushdie, subject to an
Iranian ''fatwa'', or death sentence, since the publication of Satanic
Verses.

'We have a lot of thinking to do. We have to examine our consciences.
It is clear something is wrong. We have been brought down to size by
Lazio.'
MARCELLO LIPPI
THE 4-0 defeat of Juventus by Lazio in the Italian championship was
greeted warmly in Glasgow, but any belief that Rangers might benefit
from the going over suffered by the Serie A side is born of nothing more
substantial than hope.
A detached look at what has happened recently to Juventus would
suggest that they will be in a foul mood when they arrive in Glasgow
this morning and that cannot be to the advantage of the Scottish
champions.
If anything, Juventus have been hurt deeply and that would seem to be
the case if the words of their manager, Marcello Lippi, can be taken as
a reliable measure.
He and his players suffered criticism of their performance against
Lazio in Rome's Olympic Stadium on Sunday and their midweek defeat by
Atalanta in the Italian Cup was not received well either. Juventus, who
have not lost in their Champions' League section, arrive in Glasgow
knowing they have to restore faith and face.
''We have a lot of thinking to do,'' said Lippi. ''We have to examine
our consciences. It is clear something is wrong.''
There is no doubt the Italian champions have decided that winning the
Champions' Cup is their priority, but if they had been coming to Ibrox
fuelled by the sense of wellbeing which two wins in domestic competition
would have provided, they might have been more inclined to go easy at
Ibrox.
They have virtually won Section C and they might have taken the view
that it would have been better to tread carefully against Rangers rather
than become involved in any kind of tousy confrontation.
Successive defeats have relieved them of that option and the players
must know they again have to try to turn on the style and find Andy
Goram's net. ''We have been brought down to size by Lazio,'' Lippi
added, ''but it is not terminal. I don't accept we have a crisis.
''In life and in football we must overcome the bad things by being
men. We have had a slap in the face.''
The manager added that his team looked tired and jaded in Rome, but
pointed out that he can motivate them. ''I take the responsibility for
the results on the pitch,'' he stressed.
Lippi, then, will have been spending time between their weekend defeat
and the game against Rangers reminding his players of their own
responsibilities and of the qualities they possess. The consequences
could be dire again for a Rangers side which continues to be weakened by
injuries and suspensions.
Yesterday was like any other in recent times at Ibrox with another
lengthy chat about the wounded and unavailable. Walter Smith had
problems, which became obvious very quickly when Rangers played in the
Stadio Delle Alpi just under a fortnight ago, but instead of having a
wider choice this time, he finds he is worse off.
David Robertson, Craig Moore, Brian Laudrup, and Trevor Steven cannot
even be considered, and Stuart McCall remains a concern.
Also, Gordon Durie, Alan McLaren, and Alex Cleland are all suspended
and again Smith will have to turn to players like John Brown, who has
started out on a new career in coaching, and even he has a sore knee.
However, Brown would have to be a stretcher case before he could be
ruled out.
''Yes, it is very frustrating to get this far, to be in the Champions'
League yet unable to field the strongest side or see the side express
itself fully,'' the manager said. ''But there is nothing I can do about
any of that and I just have to get on with it.''
Obviously players like Goram, Richard Gough, Gordan Petric, Paul
Gascoigne, McCall, if fully fit, and Ian Ferguson will have vital parts
to play tomorrow night when Rangers simply must take something from the
game if they wish to harbour even the slightest hope of qualifying for
the quarter-final stages.
They have only a single point from their 2-2 Ibrox draw with Borussia
Dortmund and with a home game aganst Steaua Bucharest and the away match
against the Germans to come after tomorrow, Smith knows time is no
longer an ally.
''We have got to have a go if we are to have any aspirations about
qualifying,'' Smith said. ''We won't get anything by sitting back hoping
and we will have to take the bull by the horns.
''I don't think Juventus's last couple of matches will help us any, at
least I don't take much encouragement from them because they are geared
up this season for the Champions' League more than anything else.''
Smith will be looking for something special from Gascoigne and also
Charlie Miller, who will be in midfield even though he only started
playing again on Saturday after a shin splints problem. Gary Bolan and
Brian Reid will be drafted into the squad, but no matter which players
are chosen, their effort tomorrow night will have to be remarkable if
they are to survive, let alone beat Juventus.

SIMON Donnelly is doubtful for Celtic's clash with Paris St Germain on
Thursday -- not because of the injury he collected at the weekend
against Aberdeen, but because of a virus which struck him yesterday
morning.
Donnelly reported sick and became a major concern for Celtic manager
Tommy Burns as the Glasgow club prepare for their European Cup-winners'
Cup second leg tie with the French side at Parkhead. But, while that
worry remains, other injury doubts cleared as Burns was able to plan for
the game which will mean so much to the Scottish Cup holders.
Two of the key players who missed the victory over Aberdeen, which
boosted Celtic's premier division challenge, will return.
Internationalists Andreas Thom and John Collins will line up against
the Paris side who will arrive in Glasgow tomorrow to defend a single
goal lead from the first leg in the Parc des Princes.
Thom, who had a burst blood vessel in a foot, was passed fit yesterday
while Collins, who damaged his back in training before the Aberdeen
game, also will be ready.
The news of the two men who missed the match against Aberdeen was
particularly welcome for Burns. He saw his side win decisively in the
premier match against a Pittodrie side who have title ambitions of their
own.
Now he will be able to strengthen his team with men of genuine
European class. Meanwhile, Burns will wait to assess just Donnelly's
fitness before deciding his final line-up for a game which could yet
push Celtic centre stage in Europe with a place in the quarter-finals of
this tournament.
Paris St Germain have won twice in succession in their own
championship since the first-leg game, and their players now claim that
they have returned to form. The Frenchmen must hope they are right if
they intend to see off a Celtic side brimming with confidence and backed
by that legendary Parkhead support.

ONE moment he was gliding through the heart of the midfield evading
the lunges of desperate Middlesbrough defenders with his bright red
Manchester United jersey billowing behind, and the next he was playing
the role of teenage hearthrob. Such is the way of life for Ryan Giggs,
footballer and superstar.
Yesterday, only a couple of days after he had been a significant
influence in United's 2-0 victory, he was in Glasgow fulfilling a
sponsorship contract.
His adoring public, most of them in their teens, started arriving
outside Greaves' Sauchiehall Street sports shop from 10am and stood in
the drizzle waiting for the young Welshman to show up and sign
autographs. One little old lady was welcomed inside before the rush and
had a cup of tea with the player. It was a nice touch from a footballer
who must find it difficult to remain in touch with reality.
It is only a year or so ago his manager, Alex Ferguson, was keeping
him away from the press, to make sure he would have a chance to mature
in relative anonymity, but he is such a talent he could not be kept
hidden, although yesterday the PR man from the firm engaged to promote
his work with Reebok almost succeeded in doing what Ferguson couldn't.
These days he is one of a number of precocious talents at Old
Trafford, but he is the only one who can command the degree of interest
generated by Eric Cantona.
''You get brought up on this sort of thing when you come through the
system with Manchester United, but it is still very flattering,'' he
said.

Munich
FIRST the bad news. Jurgen Klinsmann, the Teutonic pest who dumped
Raith Rovers almostsingle-handedly in the first leg of their UEFA
Cup-tie at Easter Road, has defied every diagnosis and expects to be
ready to play against them in the return tonight in the Olympic stadium.
Now the good news. This Lazarus-like recovery from what had appeared to
be serious injury at the weekend has caused a minor rammy in the Bayern
Munich dressing room where his designated deputy, Alexander Zickler, is
not amused.
Klinsmann damaged his ankle during the game with Stuttgart last
Saturday which appeared to be a recurrence of the same injury that had
prevented him turning out for a handful of games at the start of the
season.
However, the resourceful Jurgen decided to check for himself when he
was left behind as the team went to their training camp 50km from town.
He asked a private specialist to give his ankle a scan and that showed
that the ligament was no worse than strained. He turned up at the
training camp yesterday morning where the club doctor agreed that he
might be fit enough to take part.
This news was not greeted with great enthusiasm by Zickler who was
already earmarked for the main striking role. Said the man who played on
the right wing at Easter Road: ''If I am replaced by Klinsmann, I will
be very disappointed. I thought I did very well when I came on for him
on Saturday, apart from scoring two goals.''
The fact that there is some turbulence in the ranks of a team that
will already have discounted the wee Rovers won't do the Fifers any
harm, but it will still need a miracle to produce what would be the most
remarkable turnaround in Scottish football's European history.
Step forward Tony Rougier, a man who believes miracles are possible.
The gifted player from Trinidad and Tobago already considers what has
happened to him as something of a miracle. ''Eight months ago I was
playing in semi-pro football in Trinidad. Since then I have been up
against Paul Gascoigne, Brian Laudrup, Jurgen Kinsmann and Jean-Pierre
Papin. It is unbelievable.
''I am a very spiritual person and I believe my God is taking care of
me right now.''
His manager, Jimmy Nicholl, who is equally adamant that the 2-0
deficit from the first leg is not insuperable, is seriously considering
keeping in place the two young men who faced Rangers on Saturday. ''Ian
McMillan and Mark Buist did so well that they have to be in the frame to
play.''
McMillan, a self-confessed Rangers fan, was unruffled by that baptism
and is unlikely to be disturbed by the subdued atmosphere of an expeted
small attendance in the Olympic stadium.
His lack of height, however, could prove a problem if it is
capitalised upon by the Germans. But if, as Rougier said, the entire
teams gives of its all, the Rovers' pride could remain intact.
One of his teammates, Colin Cameron, who has been especially
impressive this season, is interesting Bolton Wanderers who saw him turn
in another good show against Rangers. However he, like his colleagues,
has other things to attend to first.

The software department at Scottish Enterprise has put
its magazine on the Internet, but not without a little help
from CIMS, Joan Grady reports
FAR from being considered as an ''anorak'' thing, the Internet is
shaping up to be the business tool of the future. It is a source of
information from all over the world, and businesses are now realising
the advantages of becoming part of the net.
Its potential as a marketing tool is enormous. Capable of transmitting
detailed multi-media marketing information all over the world, the power
and reach of the net as a marketing medium means businesses are linking
up.
It can include graphics, animation, even video clips and is
interactive to a degree which could soon outstrip the fax machine. It is
possible to send, for example, a spreadsheet halfway round the world by
electronic mail, have a partner work on it and e-mail it back -- all for
the price of a local telephone call.
Getting linked up to the net is relatively easy -- there are access
providers who, for a fee, will connect you to the World Wide Web. This
is a network within the network used for sending and receiving
information. Once you're there, however, how do you know how to make the
best of this new tool?
Scottish Enterprise's software department wanted to place its magazine
on the net but was unsure of the best way to present it. ''Scottish
Enterprise and the software group have an interest in the World Wide Web
and Internet, so we had our eyes and ears open,'' said Robin Mair,
editor of Software Echo.
''We heard Caledonian Information and Media Services were doing
something on the web and discussed putting the Software Echo on. We
persuaded CIMS to do it as an experiment -- a joint experiment between
us and them.''
By making use of the CIMS team of graphic designers, animators,
writers, programmers, technicians and marketing professionals, Scottish
Enterprise was presented with a new version of its magazine.
''The magazine was well received, and we launched it publicly in June
this year,'' said Mair. ''Since then we have agreed with CIMS to publish
future issues -- we provide the material and they edit it.
''It's a full-colour 32-page quarterly magazine with 22,000 readers in
Scotland and overseas. It's aimed specifically at the Scottish market
but putting it on the web gives an international audience the chance to
see what's happening on the software scene in Scotland.
''We wanted our entrance to the web to be professional, with nice
graphics and so on. We have little logos and icons which permeate our
features to add a bit of spice and remind the reader which section
they're reading: news, or multi-media for example.''
Mair found one of the greatest benefits was in being able to interact
with readers. ''The benefit of having the publication on the web is that
it reaches a wider audience, and we can invite comments through
e-mail,'' said Mair. ''Eventually we'll set up a bulletin board for
people who read the Software Echo and want to comment.''
Even without electronic mail, CIMS can provide information on who is
accessing the material. It can tell how many people are reading the
information, which time they are reading it at and in which country. It
is even possible to tell which page, or which part of a page, that
reader is most interested in.
The advantages to a marketing department are obvious. Not only can it
tell from this information who is paying most attention to its
activities, it can identify which part of these activities is most
important to the reader. This gives it the information it needs to
target marketing and advertising material more effectively.
With all these advantages, it might seem fair to assume that the
Internet will gradually phase out the printed word as a marketing
medium. But Robin Mair doesn't think so.
''It is in no way phasing out paper -- it's entirely complementary,''
he said. ''There's nothing like a magazine. You can carry it around all
day, browse through it at lunch, read it on the train, on the way home
-- you can't do that on the Internet.
''It supplies a version of the magazine where most of the stories are
summarised. If the reader wants to read the summary that's fine. If they
want to know more they can click on the screen and choose which topic to
go into in more depth. By and large everything is there -- it's a
re-edited version of the same information.''
Producing any kind of information electronically has an advantage over
printed material in that should any of it become out of date, it can be
revised almost immediately. Information placed on the net should be
updated frequently, and this is another service CIMS can provide.
CIMS will charge a basic fee for connection to the Internet, but each
additional service carries an additional fee, so companies may not want
to take advantage of all the available services to begin with.
''We're not doing any updating at the moment,'' said Mair. ''It all
costs money so it's something to consider as we move forward.''
The Internet database contains a list of companies, products and
services from all over the world. It is now possible to find
products/services/companies which exactly match your needs or
specifications by typing those specifications into the Net. It presents
an opportunity businesses cannot afford to miss out on.
''We believe there is tremendous opportunity in this field of activity
for Scottish businesses because it is making information available to an
international audience,'' said Mair. ''It's another way of doing
business and if companies in Scotland don't pay attention to that
they'll miss out.''
Linked up: Robin Mair's magazine now reaches a world-wide audience
We wanted our entrance to the web to be professional, with nice
graphics and so on. We have little logos and icons which permeate our
features to add a bit of spice and remind the reader which section

PUPILS at Linlithgow Academy are surfing the Internet further and
faster than those in any other Scottish school thanks to a #25,000
donation in May from Sun Microsystems. The school was presented with the
500,000th system to come off the production line since the Linlithgow
plant opened in 1990.
The package included software and services and is also paying for
training a teacher in the use of the equipment.
The power and sophistication of the technology now at the fingertips
of the Linlithgow pupils puts them far ahead of those in other schools.
The system provides permanent access to the Internet and the millions of
pages of information it offers.
To date most of the UK educational use of the Internet has been by
universities and colleges. Only a handful of schools are involved and
none at the level which is now available at Linlithgow.
Rector John Low, said: ''The pace at which communications technology
is being driven by commerce and industry is accelerating. The future
workforce and consumer will need to have network literacy.
''Schools are traditionally left chasing technological development,
but this computer system will put Linlithgow Academy and its pupils
abreast of the very latest developments.''
The Sun equipment is at the heart of the school's ambitious LATTICE
programme (Learning And Teaching Telecommunication and Information
Centre) which is being developed with support from parents and former
pupils. Members of the Sun Community Action Volunteer Group have been
actively involved in planning the installation of their equipment.

THE importance of providing suitable accommodation as part of the care
in the community programme was emphasised yesterday by Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson.
Mr Robertson was speaking at the opening of a #1.65m development at St
Leonard's Court in Ayr which is the result of a partnership of the
Margaret Blackwood Housing Association, Strathclyde Region social work
department, Ayrshire and Arran Health Board and Kyle and Carrick
District Council.
The development provides 12 houses for physically disabled tenants
supported by a team of workers on the site and 19 mainstream and elderly
amenity houses with a mixture of single and family accommodation.
Mr Robertson said: ''As we see the care in the community programme
develop, it is becoming increasingly clear that people want to live as
close to their own area as possible. Specialist projects like this which
are a partnership of a number of agencies provide that opportunity.''
Sir Mark Russell, chairman of Margaret Blackwood Housing Association,
said: ''The opening of St Leonard's Court makes a further step forward
for the association in its role of providing modern accommodation
specifically designed for people with disabilities.

CIMS and United Artists sign pilot scheme pact. BILL SINCLAIR reports.
WHEN United Artists was founded in 1919 by four Hollywood greats,
Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and the director D.W.
Griffiths, movies were its business. The company is still very much in
the movies business through its cable television operation, but today it
has so much more to offer.
Alongside the television signals on its fibre-optic networks it
carries digital telephone lines, and it is this service which is about
to open up the information superhighway for United Artists in a pilot
scheme developed with CIMS.
United Artists Communications Scotland is part of TeleWest
Communications plc, the largest cable television operator in the UK. It
currently wholly owns 16 cable franchises in the United Artists name and
has interests in a further eight.
Although telephone and television services are UA's main business, it
is also at the forefront of online information development and has
signed a co-operation agreement with Caledonian Information &amp; Media
Services (CIMS) to develop a unique information service for the West of
Scotland.
Ray Perman, CIMS corporate sales director, who signed the deal with
Bart Bonsall, managing director of United Artists Communications
Scotland, said: ''Details will be announced shortly, but the project is
very exciting and we are delighted to be working with a company of the
calibre of UA.''
The two major shareholders of TeleWest are US West, one of the leading
regional telephone companies in the US with 25 million customers, and
Telecommunications Inc (TCI), the world's largest cable operator.
United Artists is the largest cable operator in Scotland and it is
investing #400m in developing cable networks across the Central Belt.
These networks are due for completion by early 1998, by which time the
cable services will reach more than 650,000 homes and businesses
throughout central Scotland.
Already the company has more than 60,000 television customers and more
than 45,000 residential customers.
United Artists started its operations in Edinburgh in May 1992, and in
September 1993 it acquired further franchises across central Scotland,
including Perth, Dundee, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy, Uddingston, East
Kilbride, Hamilton, Motherwell, Cumbernauld, Coatbridge, Airdrie,
Dumbarton, Livingston, Falkirk and part of West Lothian.
Cable-laying work is currently being carried out in Airdrie,
Cumbernauld, Bo'ness and Edinburgh.
At present the company employs 740 people at its operational bases in
Uddingston, Perth, Dundee and Glenrothes, as well as at the headquarters
at South Gyle, Edinburgh.
The United Artists telephone service offers customers savings of 10 to
15% on call charges, compared with rival telephone operators, and fully
itemised monthly billing at no extra cost.
In areas where the telephone service is available, approximately one
in four business is taking advantage of it. According to the Cable
Communications Association, at least 50,000 telephone customers a month
are switching to cable.
A Cable in the Classroom project, launched by United Artists in
September 1994, offers schools the opportunity to connect to the cable
network and receive the multi-channel cable television service free of
charge. Programming available includes the foreign language channels and
offers a range of learning opportunities.
The cable television service offers customers more than 40 channels
without the need for a satellite dish. These include all the BBC and ITV
stations, the satellite channels, plus cable-exclusive channels.
As the signals are delivered underground via the fibre-optic cable
network, the pictures are crystal clear and the sound is super sharp,
There is no interference from surrounding buildings or geographic
features, or from bad weather.

Grant cuts, resit
fees and hardship
bring them out
to debate with
some (whisper it)
enthusiasm, writes
Duncan Moir
YOU can always rely on students to confound your expectations. Since
the late eighties, Britain's students have had a growing reputation for
apathy. They seemed to care more about toga parties than politics.
But earlier this month, nearly 400 students at Strathclyde
University's Union reversed 13 years of political indifference at their
first quorate general meeting on the city centre campus since 1982.
Enthusiastic students turned up to debate a motion dealing with many
aspects of student hardship such as grant cuts and resit fees.
The Extraordinary General Meeting had been given a high profile on
campus. The union's communications sabbatical officer, Peter Ross,
called for a decent level of grant and the immediate abolition of resit
fees.
Strathclyde University students on the city centre campus currently
pay #10 per credit to resit any exams which they fail. In a curious
anomaly, students on the Jordanhill campus do not pay such fees.
Students heard that it was nonsensical to levy a financial penalty on an
academic failure.
The Secretary to the university, Peter West, stated that the
university stood behind the motion, commenting that he supported a
''phasing out'' of resits altogether, and insisting that university
management would be looking into it.
The President of the National Union of Students, Jim Murphy, used his
opening address to establish the benefits that students could expect
from the National Union of Students. He concluded by asserting that the
Government ''should be more concerned with what we have in our minds
than in our pockets''.
But was this enough? Could one undergraduate get-together indicate an
end to student apathy? Lee Whitehill, a third-year politics student who
attended the meeting, seemed to think so. He said: ''Let's hope students
are finally prepared to stand up for themselves. I certainly feel that
we can make a difference now.''
Second-year student Kirsty O'Brien noted, however: ''No one can deny
the strength of feeling surrounding these issues. But whether the
student executive can actually achieve anything . . . well, I'm not so
sure about that.''
There is some doubt on campus about whether student officers are able
to make good on their promises. Liam McMonagle, President of
Strathclyde's student association, has no such qualms. ''The EGM was a
marvellous start to the year. My job now is to start converting the
issues into results.''
There seems to be a growing belief on campus that positive activism
can actually have some effect. Peter Ross spoke of a ''new breed of
student, a student who will no longer passively accept his or her lot''.
Jim Murphy saw the meeting as indicative of a genuine feeling among
students that real change was possible. ''The fact that so many people
turned out tells me that Strathclyde students care about the issues.
Hopefully, they will involve themselves in NUS campaigns throughout the
coming year,'' he said.
Whether the meeting marks a new generation of activism remains to be
seen, but one thing remains clear -- students expect their elected
representatives to work hard on their behalf.
Only when student leaders deliver on their promises will anyone
genuinely be able to claim that student apathy is on the run.

Hi-tech educators are delighted with their EMMA, reports DICK LOUDEN
THE dynamic world of multimedia has its own Oscars. They're called
EMMAs (European Multimedia Awards) and Scotland has just won one of
them. This high distinction -- marked by an official presentation at a
ceremony in Frankfurt -- has come the way of the Glasgow-based Scottish
Council for Educational Technology for its CD-ROM on 5-14 Music.
Somehow this major award -- first in the business/technical category
-- seems a natural progression for SCET, which over the last few years
has been adopting an influential high-profile role in information
technology in Scotland, specialising in particular in the production of
quality curricular software for schools.
The 5-14 CD-ROM, already widely used in Scottish schools and surely
now assured of even greater uptake, was created by SCET in conjunction
with the Northern College of Education, which was responsible for
determining and collating the content, and the Scottish Office Education
Department, which offered a particularly valuable input through a member
of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Schools, Graham Norris, who was a
principal teacher of music before becoming an inspector.
According to SCET's chief executive, Nigel Paine, ''it was a fully
collaborative approach over a period of time by the three agencies. Our
role at SCET was to structure the material and set it into electronic
form''.
The result is a highly impressive teacher resource. It is no secret
that many primary class teachers have traditionally felt less than
comfortable in the area of music teaching and there was every
justification for Northern College to conclude that a package of
materials specifically tailored for the non-specialist teacher would be
widely welcomed.
The CD-ROM also has a lot to offer the visiting specialist teacher of
music, who can spend only a limited amount of time in each school, and
the head teacher, who is thus able to maintain a succinct overview of
the school's music policy and assessment practices. One of the
advantages of the way in which the CD-ROM is structured is that teachers
do not have to finish it in one sitting; they can spend as much or as
little time as they need.
CD-ROMs offer immense storage capacity and on this single one teachers
are guided through the whole spectrum of music-teaching resources, with
numerous video and audio clips included as illustrations across a range
of musical instruments, and are also shown how to assess pupil progress.
Then there is the facility for them to maintain on the CD-ROM their
assessment profiles of individual pupils which relate achievement to the
five national levels of the 5-14 Programme. In other words, it
represents a compact teaching and assessment scheme for the entire area
of music within the 5-14 guidelines for Expressive Arts, and one disk,
available at #40, is all that a school requires.
Members of staff can simply decide what material they wish to extract
from the CD-ROM, including their own assessment records, and take it
away on a floppy disc as their personal copy.
Understandably, Nigel Paine is elated at the prestigious award which
SCET has just won against such severe competition. ''We were up against
1000 entries, some from the most major companies in the information
technology field like Microsoft and Philips,'' he says. ''In some cases
they had spent as much as #0.25 million to develop their entries -- ours
cost a tenth of that.
''What the judges liked about our CD-ROM was its depth. They saw it as
a tailor-made solution to a substantial problem.''
Some education authorities, recognising the potential value of this
new music resource, have been quick to buy bulk supplies for issue to
their schools. Nigel Paine sees enormous possibilities in developing
similar CD-ROMs for other areas of the 5-14 curriculum where some
primary teachers lack confidence.
He cites in particular science, art and drama, which can offer
difficulties to the generalist teacher. However, discussion with the
Scottish Office would be a necessary prelude to taking forward such
initiatives because of the initial expenditure involved.
Looking beyond the 5-14 area, he is also keen to devise a series of
CD-ROMs designed to prepare teachers for implementation of Higher Still
in 1998 and beyond. ''In particular, we could offer a valuable service
in explaining the new modular structures,'' he says, ''and give
illustrated examples of good practice.''
The Scottish teaching profession may well support this view. Nigel
Paine's not-immodest belief that ''SCET is delivering to Scottish
teachers the resources that they need in the classroom'' is reinforced
by the popularity of the many imaginative software packages for which it
has been responsible. Further EMMAs are not out of the question.

THERE will be no dispensation for Premiership sides with fewer than
three players on international duty during the weekend of the Western
Samoa Test at Murrayfield, which is followed 24 hours later by a full
programme of league action.
Scotland play the Samoans on Saturday, November 18, and on the Sunday
it will be business as usual for clubs still battling it out for
championship honours.
Yesterday SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said the league programme,
including the batch of Sunday fixtures, had been set in place after
consultation with the clubs when it had been known that an international
match was taking place on the same weekend.
''The three-player rule still applies. If a club have three or more
players on duty with Scotland, then they can apply for a postponement of
the league game the following day. But we went into this with our eyes
open. Everybody knew that this was going to be a crowded weekend, but it
was the clubs' decision.''
Hogg, speaking at the monthly Murrayfield media briefing, indicated
that clubs with fewer than three players on Scotland duty who sought a
postponement would be ordered to play. ''But I hope that it would not
come to that,'' he added.
''Medical advice is that players should not play twice in a weekend
but, ultimately, it will be a decision for the individuals concerned.''
* CONTRACTS of employment for Scottish internationalists should be
completed within the week. The contract, details of which are still
being negotiated, will run until the end of March. A separate agreement
will be in place for the New Zealand tour next summer.

Dennis Blyth in the Hong Kong Classic Pairs after earlier launching
their title bid with a 27-11 win over the Kowloon Cricket Club duo, Loy
D'Souza and Terry Byrnes.
The Scots played well in their opening match, racing to a 13-2 lead
after just eight ends, and 10 ends later they had the match well under
control at 20-11, before finishing in style with seven shots over the
last three ends.
However, they found the going a lot tougher under the Kowloon
floodlights. The football club duo, skipped by Scots-born Dennis Blyth,
had earlier lost by just three shots to Ireland and, despite pushing the
Scots for most of the way, it looked as if they would need to settle for
second best again when they trailed 16-12 after 18 ends.
However, a single followed by a double brought them into the match,
and when Marshall resorted to heavy tactics on the finalend instead of
the draw shot, the locals counted the double they needed for a 17-16
win.
''The green was a lot heavier tonight than the one we played on in our
opening match, but a four-shot lead with three ends to play really
should have been enough,'' said Marshall later. Results:
England's John Ottaway and David Ward also suffered mixed fortunes,
losing their opening game 13-22 to the Channel Islanders, Adrian Welch
and David Le Maquand, but beat Craigengower Cricket Club 23-19. The
Channel Islands duo beat Canada, while Wales finished with a 100 per
cent record. Results:

<HEADLINE>Crestacare is holding talks with a Scottish health board to build unit for the mentally ill. Private group to provide services</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NEW chief executive of Crestacare has spoken publicly for the
first time since taking over from Mr Andrew Taee, dismissed last month
for what has been described as ''a very serious breach of contract''.
Dr Magdy Ishak told The Herald of his aims and aspirations for one of
Scotland's biggest private nursing home groups and the UK's
third-largest provider in the private healthcare market.
He revealed that a major push is under way to pursue opportunities
available under the Government's controversial Private Finance
Initiative, designed to cut state borrowing but meet soaring demands for
capital spending on much-needed infrastructure.
Dr Ishak believes passionately that public-private partnerships are in
the best interests of consumers.
The company is already in negotiations in the Newquay area to provide
specialist units for people who have mental illnesses or have suffered
brain injuries.
It has also been in talks with an unidentified Scottish health board,
in partnership with a hospital trust, to build a long-term care unit for
mentally ill people.
Crestacare would provide so-called ''hotel services'' --
receptionists, domestics, porters, and cleaners, with nursing and
clinical care left to the trust.
However, Dr Ishak emphasised that his company, in pursuing PFI
projects, wants to provide, or at least share, the core and long-term
nursing and clinical services.
It already runs an internationally renowned purpose-built clinic in
Lanarkshire for the rehabilitation of patients with serious brain
damage.
Crestacare took over the Bonkle clinic and nine Scottish private
nursing homes with almost 700 beds when it bought Scotcare, founded by
Dr Ishak, for #12.5m last year.
He stayed on as managing director of the Scottish division, but last
month replaced Mr Taee, dismissed following a unanimous decision of the
full board under the chairmanship of Sir Matthew Goodwin.
The company is still awaiting confirmation that litigation will follow
the dismissal for an alleged breach of contract relating to details of
service.
Dr Ishak -- who like Sir Matthew, former chairman of Hewden Stuart, is
known for running a tight ship -- is currently studying ways to cut the
group's operating overheads.
Crestacare's head office, formerly based in Manchester, is now in
London, with regional offices in Leeds, Belfast, and at Murdostoun
Castle, Bonkle.
However, it appears increasingly unlikely that the headquarters will
transfer north of the Border as recently forecast.
London and the south-west are regarded as key areas for a strategic
expansion into specialist care services, while also tapping into
prosperous areas for the traditional private nursing home market.
Crestacare currently operates 3000 beds in 49 homes, and also runs
centres for elderly people with dementia, young people with physical
disabilities, and people with alcohol-related problems.
It has set an expansion target of five nursing homes with up to 300
beds in the south-west, and is looking at sites in London to provide
specialist facilities with up to 250 beds.
Further growth is expected in Scotland, where planning permission has
already been lodged for two homes with 120 beds in Edinburgh. The
company also hopes to provide a 30-bed unit in Glasgow to care for young
people with severe physical disabilities.
Dr Ishak said savings from streamlining the company will go to towards
''meeting the standards of care that everyone now demands''.
He added one way to achieve that will be to invest in people,
especially the frontline care workers, and continued: ''I believe the
needs of the market are shifting to providing a service geared to
demands within the community -- high standards, and specialised care.
''The days of having a nursing home, of dumping people together, and
giving them some medicine, are long gone.''
Dr Ishak, 47, who graduated from Cairo University Medical School and
came to the UK in 1975 to embark on a career in orthopaedic surgery,
added: ''It is my intention to enforce public-private partnerships in a
meaningful way. There is no doubt that the private sector can deliver
improved services in healthcare.''

<HEADLINE>Tynecastle coffers bare for fight against the drop. Jefferies must rely on patience and hard work</HEADLINE>

HEARTS' manager Jim Jefferies may be sitting at the bottom of the
premier division this morning, but you won't get him to say that he
regrets the decision he made to take the troubled Tynecastle job at the
start of the season.
It doesn't matter to him that the club has become something of a
managerial graveyard over recent seasons. His major concern remains
trying to get the Edinburgh side he supported so long as a kid and
served so long as a player back in shape.
He recognises now that this will take him longer than he first
anticipated when he walked out on Falkirk to take on the task in the
summer.
But he refuses to entertain any suggestions that he allowed his heart
to rule his head when he made up his mind after days of indecision.
''Look,''he said yesterday, ''I'm not daft. I have been in the game a
long time and I knew what I was going into. I had spoken to other people
in football about the situation at Hearts, including Mo Johnston, who
had been with the club before I took him to Falkirk.
''He confirmed most of what I had heard and what I had been thinking
myself and, to be honest, now that I have been here for several months,
Mo was right on the button with his advice.''
Jefferies believes that the Coca-Cola Cup quarter final defeat from
Dundee was the major setback he and his players have had to suffer this
season. Not only because of the manner of their loss -- it came after a
penalty shoot-out -- but because it reopened old wounds.
Says Jefferies: ''We might have been sitting in the same position as
Aberdeen right now, looking at a major cup final appearance following a
battle for survival in the premier division last season. It was so close
and then it was snatched away from the players yet again.
''I think that affected a lot of the lads who have been here for a
long spell. They have been so near so often and then faced
disappointment and when it happened again it was almost is if they felt
they would never get the opportunity to win a trophy.''
The problem for Jefferies, of course, as it is for most other managers
in the premier division, is that there is no time to lick your wounds,
and little time to indulge in self-pity.
''If you start to feel sorry for yourselves then you are going to end
up as losers,''he claims.
''Our major challenge this season is to stay away from relegation. We
are in the kind of league where you are happily in mid-table one week
and then down at the bottom the next.
''Last season Dundee United went down while Aberdeen were involved in
the play-off against Dunfermline. Hearts were only safe on the last day
and Thistle and Falkirk and Kilmarnock were able to stay up because they
battled for each other week in and week out. In this cut-throat league
that has to be done.''
He knows that he cannot buy his way out of trouble. ''I don't have a
penny,'' he confesses.
He looks enviously towards Tayside, where another new manager, Billy
Kirkwood, has been given the resources to reshape the side which was
relegated last season.
Says Jefferies: ''Billy has had the money to go out and get the
players he wants. Obviously, he felt there should be a clear-out and he
has been able to move on players and bring in his own men and at the
weekend we saw that he is going in the right direction.
''That kind of option has not been open to me. We have to go another
road here. We have to be patient and we have to work hard and we have to
look for the good young players we have developing in the right way and
for our injured players to get back to action.
''I can honestly say that I do not feel under any more pressure than
any other manager in the country. I do feel frustrated, though and all
that does is convince me that I have to work harder on getting my
thoughts over to the players here. When I do that then we will see the
results follow.''
Ideally, Jefferies would want to see them come over the next three
games against Partick Thistle at Tynecastle this weekend; at Fir Park
against Motherwell next Tuesday and, finally, at home again to
Kilmarnock on Saturday week.
Even two home wins would catapult Jefferies and his men up the table
-- but staying in a safe position is always going to be their worry
until the revival really begins.

<HEADLINE>Borders salmon producers plan major expansion</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975618218</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAJOR expansion is being planned by the Berwickshire smoked salmon
producers, Farne Salmon and Trout of Duns, one of the biggest employers
in the Borders.
It follows the firm's diversification into smoked salmon-based
delicatessen products and if sales forecasts are met it envisages a
#1.5m plant being constructed next year, employing an estimated 150
people to handle the new range.
The announcement was made yesterday when Borders MP Archy Kirkwood
opened a #100,000 pilot plant at Duns where 30 people are employed to
meet orders from major UK and European multiples.
Farne Salmon was launched in Duns in 1982 with a staff of six and has
a permanent workforce of 350 at its headquarters and salmon slicing
plants in Galashiels, with an additional 100 people employed on a
seasonal basis.
Turnover this year is estimated at #20m and managing director Andrew
Colvin said: ''We believe Duns is the best location for the development
and talks have already started with Scottish Borders Enterprise.
''The initial orders for the new range are promising and there could
also be a spin-off for the Galashiels operation where we are considering
the possibility of a third plant which could mean another 30 jobs
there.''
Mr Kirkwood added: ''If we can get the circumstances right this could
be a long-term winner and the company deserves the backing of the
authorities.''
Commenting on the creativity of the management team, he said: ''They
are as imaginative as any in the Borders and the firm has a committed
workforce.''
The company's sales projection for the current year is over 1200
tonnes, of which about 70% is for export.

EDINBURGH-based Kwik-Fit yesterday denied a newspaper report that it
is considering floating off its Continental European operations or that
it is considering a listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange.
Finance director John Houston said it would make no commercial sense
for the car tyre, exhaust replacement, and insurance group to hive off
the operations in Holland and Belgium at a time when they were doing
extremely well and were being expanded.
They account for about one-third of the group's business and represent
a major opportunity to expand the Tom Farmer marketing concept in
North-west Europe. Holland and Belgium brought in #5.5m of the #16.5m
interim operating profits.
The initial foray into France was unsuccessful and was effectively
terminated in 1991. However, future expansion into Denmark and other
parts of Scandinavia is possible.
Mr Houston added that an Amsterdam listing would be useful ''but it is
not a project'' and he was not thinking of it.

MANAGER Roy Aitken yesterday admitted Aberdeen have still to discover
the secret of becoming a serious threat in the title race.
The Pittodrie side now trail by nine points in the championship after
the defeat by Celtic dealt a severe blow to their ambitions.
Coming hard on the heels of beating the other half of the Old Firm to
clinch a Coca-Cola Cup Final place, that was a major disappointment for
Aitken, who said yesterday: ''There is a thin line between success and
failure and we still have to learn how to cross it.
''We know now how difficult it is to go to Glasgow and get
back-to-back victories. But even in their most successful period
Aberdeen were never able to achieve this regularly.
''I have a young team who have done remarkably well. They have set
standards for themselves but must produce them consistently.
''We will learn from the Celtic defeat and be ready the next time.''
Dons keeper Michael Watt is expected to be out for three weeks with
the knee injury he sustained at Parkhead.
Meanwhile, midfielder Paul Kane, put up for sale at the start of the
season, may be moving to St Johnstone. Further negotiations will take
place this week and Kane could make his debut for the Perth side at
Dumbarton on Saturday.

BURN Stewart Distillers have launched their Scottish Leader
value-for-money blended whisky in England for the first time.
Executive chairman Bill Thornton said Scottish Leader, hitherto sold
only in Scotland and overseas, was launched in London earlier this
month.
Burn Stewart is using its close association with Rangers football club
to promote the brand in pubs, clubs, and hotels in the M25 area, he
said.
The Barrhead-based independent distiller extended a #1m five-year loan
to Rangers in July as a marketing ploy.
In return it gets perks such as free use of a hospitality suite at
Ibrox Stadium at European matches and free stadium advertising. Mr
Thornton also becomes an honorary associate director of the club.
''We are alienating ourselves to some degree from part of the
market,'' Mr Thornton admitted, apparently referring to whisky-drinking
Celtic supporters.''But we cannot be all things to all people,'' he
added.
Scottish Leader is Burn Stewart's leading brand, but sales in England
are unlikely to be huge.
More than 90% of the company's UK sales come from own label brands
bottled specially for supermarkets, so Scottish Leader will not be
marketed in competition with them through mainstream retail outlets.
Speaking after an uneventful annual meeting of Burn Stewart in
Glasgow, Mr Thornton said he was not hopeful of a government cut in duty
on spirits in next month's budget to offset a special 26p increase
imposed last December.
''I am not optimistic,'' he said.
Looking ahead, Mr Thornton said Burn Stewart's high level of gearing
should stabilise this year at around 100% after the company's net debts
soared to #34.4m in the year to July 2 from #7.7.
He said most of the new money had been borrowed to fulfil a commitment
made at flotation in 1991 to buy #30m of mature whiskies from United
Distillers over a five-year period.
That agreement, entered into at a time when Burn Stewart had only just
bought Deanston distillery in Perthshire and had few stocks of its own,
expired earlier this year.
Managing director Ian Bankier said Burn Stewart's borrowings had
peaked and would come down quickly if depressed world whisky prices
started to improve.
''We are hoping our borrowings will come down and if we can get our
margins and our prices up we will see borrowings come rattling down,''
he said.
Mr Thornton said he had nothing to add to his comment earlier this
month that whisky prices would not improve unless industry majors
stopped discounting.
''Those who are market leaders must positively take the initiative
because no external influence will provide a solution,'' he said then.
Burn Stewart, which owns Tobermory distillery on Mull and Deanston as
well as Deanston, is a small player in the game which reckons the course
of events will be decided by large multinationals such as Guinness,
American Brands, and Allied Domecq.
Its pre-tax profit fell back to #4m from #4.2m last year, largely as a
result of higher interest charges on its increased debt.
Burn Stewart shares closed down 1p at 132p.

THE first non-fiction book I ever bought -- aside from those I picked
up at jumble sales -- was Sampson's New Anatomy of Britain, writes James
McKinnon, right, former director-general of Ofgas, and currently
chairman of six plcs.
The reason this 1972 purchase remains so vivid in my memory was not
its cost -- although #6.50 was a sizeable chunk out of my grant -- (yes,
students had decent grants in those days) but the effect the book had on
me.
Here was an author prepared to tell me how Britain was really run. Up
to that point I had naively thought that it was the politicians who
wielded power: Sampson taught me that patronage and influence are gained
and exercised in altogether more subtle ways.
Ever since, I have looked forward to each new Sampson book with
anticipation and have not been let down. His dissection of the
international arms business and the oil industry in The Arms Bazaar and
The Seven Sisters respectively are landmarks in business writing.
This week I review Sampson's new book, which looks at corporate life.
DESCRIBING a period covering the past 200 years or so Company Man: The
Rise and Fall of Corporate Life* combines history and business in a
fascinating fashion.
It provides detailed information on the main events of two centuries,
cleverly linking the descriptive matter with quotations from the
literature of the time, and also introduces the medium of film as a
reference point.
The impact of this treatment gives the effect of a most readable novel
on the fate of our hero ''Company Man''.
Anthony Sampson borrows the well-worn cinematographic technique of
flashback. His story opens in late twentieth century Seattle, the home
of the Boeing Corporation, whose products have opened the world to
millions of travellers.
He then provides a close up of the Microsoft company and describes its
millionaire employees as being closeted and detached from the main
stream of Seattle society. This troubles the locals since the isolation
prevents the millionaires from spending their money. The new super-class
appears to be unaware of trickle down economics.
We are introduced to the reality of the Communications Age through the
twin media of Boeing, who made the world accessible, and Microsoft,
which facilitated instant contact between the inhabitants of the Global
Village.
The next scene, a flash-back, is set in India in the 1800s with a
description of the life and times of ''Company Man'' serving the East
India Company.
Thereafter we have detailed, and factual, coverage of all the
significant events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which have
had an impact both on business structures and those employed in selected
companies.
The varied fortunes of companies and countries are examined -- names
are named with no punches pulled. The result is to attract the attention
of the reader in a way that one would expect in the case of a thriller.
It is not only the detail, but the behaviour of individual players
which enlivens the read. For example, it may not be common knowledge
that the much revered founder of IBM, Tom Watson, had been previously
employed by the National Cash Register company. When with NCR, Watson
was given the illicit job of uncovering rivals' secrets, competing with
them and then buying them out of the market. For being caught doing so,
he was fired and sentenced to a year in jail.
From such a genesis IBM was born.
Another fascinating insight involved Alex Trotman, the son of an
Edinburgh carpet layer who became chairman of Ford in 1993. Campaigning
TV producers stood outside all the US major car manufacturers using a
megaphone to challenge bosses to come out and show their knowledge of
their company products. Only Trotman agreed and silenced his critics by
changing the oil in a Ford truck, with high efficiency.
For the harassed businessman, turned part-time public speaker, the
book provides a mine of quotable quotes and stories which beg to be
customised to a business situation well known to the audience. A fund of
material to reduce the tedium of business cocktail parties is also
provided.
An objective of the book is to show how ''Company Man'' has had to
evolve to meet the changes in his environment. As the author himself has
demonstrated in his references to Seattle, ''Company Man'' has mutated
to another form.
In order to survive, any organism must be able to respond to changes
in its environment. The faster that environment is changing the quicker
must be its response if it is to avoid extinction.
In changing conditions, at the top of the endangered species list are
the specialists. Those creatures which may have been superbly suited to
the environment as it once was, are hopelessly lost when they find
themselves in different circumstances.
There is no way back for them from the extinction cul de sac. We can
all think of examples.
Among the generals, however, there will be some who, with a few
adaptations, can fit in once more and manage their new surroundings.
Within those few, there will be one or two who find the new conditions
suit their characteristics exactly and they will become the dominant
species.
The author does not deal with these aspects, but consideration of them
by the reader may add to the intellectual appreciation of a first class
piece of writing. Anyone reading this book should try to spot the
specialists, the generalists and the smart adapters.

DUNDEE United's major spending spree could pay off tonight for a win
against Clydebank would send them top of the first division.
And that would be a confidence booster ahead of Sunday's Challenge Cup
final against Stenhousemuir.
United's new striking partnership of Gary McSwegan and Owen Coyle were
last night picked out as a major threat.
Bankies coach Brian Wright admitted: ''If I was their manager that
partnership would excite me. They create real problems for any defence.
''But there is a lot of character in our side and we are digging in
and getting results this season.''
United manager Billy Kirkwood added: ''It is early days yet for the
Coyle-McSwegan partnership but they are linking well and scoring goals.
And the good thing is that they are in position to take chances. We are
also creating those chances with Robbie Winter and Andy McLaren able to
take defences on.''
Meanwhile Stenhousemuir transfer target striker Gareth Hutchison is a
marked man.
Stenhousemuir manager Terry Christe revealed last night: ''We have
played ll league matches and an opposition player has been booked in
nine of them for fouls on him. He is an outstanding striker for he has
pace and can finish.''
But Hutchison is racing time to be fit for tonight's re-arranged
Second division clash with Berwick.
Hutchison will not be risked tonight if that could put Sunday's place
in jeopardy, and central defender George McGeachie is also struggling.
Berwick have only one doubt. Defender Craig Valentine is still
suffering from a leg injury and faces a late fitness test.

MARK Crossley wants to keep a clean sheet tonight to ensure Nottingham
Forest's progress to the UEFA Cup third round -- and make Frank Clark
smile over his version of the Englishman, Scotsman and Welshman story.
The Barnsley-born keeper has again proved himself one of the best in
the Premiership this season but his international ambitions with England
are being blocked by the brilliance of Arsenal's David Seaman.
Crossley, though, has Scottish and Welsh grandparentage and is
considering declaring himself available for one of those countries --
even though it could cost him a pay-rise at Forest, and invoke the
displeasure of manager Clark.
''I know somebody from Scotland manager Craig Brown's staff has been
checking out Crossley's qualification and I can't blame anybody for
using the rules to their advantage,'' admitted Clark, whose team defend
a 1-0 first leg lead against French side Auxerre at the City Ground.
''But if he plays for Scotland or any other country in a competitive
match he becomes a foreigner in UEFA's eyes and that could give us a
problem with no more than three non-English players allowed in European
club competitions.''
Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler go trick-or-treating at Anfield as
Liverpool bid to bewitch second round UEFA Cup rivals Brondby.
But just in case the search for a last-16 slot threatens to turn into
a horror story, #8.5m British record buy Stan Collymore should be
waiting in the wings -- and itching for an opportunity to silence the
doubters.
Striker Collymore has declared himself fit after a virus and he
dismissed as ''ridiculous and wide of the mark'' alternative weekend
allegations regarding his absence.
Collymore is the first to recognise the best he can realistically hope
for is a place on the bench after the club's magical spell of 10 goals
in the space of four days against Manchester City.
Six of them came from the revived frontline combination of Rush and
Fowler, and Collymore said: ''It's up to me to take the chance when it
comes. It's a squad game and there are going to be people who aren't
playing as well as others. Rushie and Robbie are doing well at the
moment.''
After a 0-0 first leg in Copenhagen a fortnight ago, Liverpool manager
Roy Evans does not need telling that the tie is there for the taking.
Howard Wilkinson firmly believes his team can pull off a famous UEFA
Cup victory over PSV Eindhoven.
On the face of it, Leeds haven't an earthly after losing 5-3 in the
first leg of the second round clash at Elland Road two weeks ago. But
Wilkinson remains quietly confident of securing a result that will shock
Europe.
''The game has been described as mission impossible. Let's hope when
we return on the plane we will be the A-Team,'' said Wilkinson.

Today's negative street cred culture is a tragic
waste of young talent and public money, says
Hugh Dougherty -- and he blames the parents
LEAGUE tables appear to be all the rage, often quoted and misquoted as
the measure of the success of a secondary school. But there is another
table which is never quoted as a factor affecting performance in
Standard Grade and Higher exams -- and that is the layabout table.
It is inhabited by senior pupils from secondary schools who, on any
given night, hang about street corners rather than face up to the
reality of school work and study.
If you don't believe me, take a look round your average suburb of
Glasgow. There, in all weathers and at any time -- even evening leading
up to prelim and final school exams -- you'll find them, at best hanging
about, at worst drinking under age, acting as a focus for drug dealers,
carrying out acts of vandalism.
And this ''cohort'' -- to use the educational jargon for coherent
bodies of pupils -- is by no means deprived or educationally challenged.
Many have the brains to gain university entrance and to realise their
true potential. Many come from professional homes, sometimes stuffed
with consumer goods -- the latest in computers included -- and,
surprisingly, with parents who even work within education themselves.
Yet they are free, without parental concern, to roam the streets from
about 6pm to near midnight.
You will see the layabout league, taking part in what sometimes
appears to be an impromptu fashion show of the latest designer clothes.
What you are looking at is the greatest waste of talent the educational
world knows. You are also looking at a vast waste of public money,
teaching time, and talent.
Despite living in a highly-competitive time, it often seems to me that
these young people act as sloppily, scruffily, and as stupidly as they
can. And they dress for the part, the young male aping the
drug-cultured, street cred gang worlds in the worst parts of US cities.
It comes down on their part to an all-pervasive wish to play down
talents and aspirations in their peer groups. This attitude is, I
believe, to be found in state school and private establishment alike.
But we should not blame the schools for the layabout league and its
members. Neither should education authorities take the rap. The blame
should be placed at the door of the parents who seem to have such little
regard for their teenage children that they care not a whit where they
are of an evening, despite the impending Standard Grades and Highers.
Sadly, far too many parents seem to have written off their teenagers.
And, as a result, our layabout league members seem to have written off
education, leading to desperate under-achievement, and, far too often, a
lifetime of regret that they had not spent those evenings on the streets
more profitably.
Time then, to take a hard look at the layabout league. Time, too, to
face up to the harsh fact that, this evening, as usual, the layabouts
will be on the streets in force.
Best check to reassure yourself that your child is not out there. For
not only does the layabout league member make a very visual statement
about his or her attitude to education, it is a public statement about
the state of your family life too.

CRAIG &amp; ROSE, the Edinburgh-based paint manufacturer and merchant of
wall coverings, hopes to break into profit next year after closing down
its depot in Dartford, near London, to focus more on the Scottish
market.
William Kane, the company's newly appointed managing director, made
the prediction as Craig &amp; Rose announced a doubling of first-half losses
to #203,000 and a 13% drop in sales to #2.1m.
Mr Kane, who joined the company as sales director in June, was
promoted to managing director yesterday to supervise the its return to
financial health.
He blamed mounting losses during the six months to June 30 on
declining sales of wallpaper and other non-paint items as the Dartford
depot was run down.
But he said paint sales, which account for 55% of turnover, remained
strong.
Craig &amp; Rose continues to maintain a skeleton staff at Dartford, but
the depot will be closed as soon as the premises have been sold.
Craig &amp; Rose will then concentrate on sales within Scotland from its
distribution depots in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Craig &amp; Rose has been in the red since 1991, but Mr Kane hopes to
reduce last year's pre-tax loss of #841,000 in 1995.

<HEADLINE>A rash of corporate takeovers puts investment cash in the institutional pockets. Driving up from US rally</HEADLINE>

SINCE the UK stock market, as measured by the 100 share index,
regained the 3500 level on August 18 after a gap of more than 17 months,
there have been four occasions on which it has been foced to retreat
below that psychological barrier.
This should not be regarded as a sign that the preponderance of
investors think shares are over-valued. In fact the FTSE-100 has only
spent six trading days in the 3400s in the last 10 weeks, and has never
closed below 3500 on more than two consecutive days.
On Friday the market was hit by Wall Street influences (weakness in
the Mexican peso and unexpectedly strong growth in US gross domestic
product), but before the night was out the Dow-Jones index had rallied
strongly. On the back of this the FTSE-100 share index gained 12.1
points yesterday to 3510.0.
Weak money supply figures also generated some premature interest rate
optimism in the City.
Although there have been a number of big daily changes in the Footsie
index the market has been trading in a narrow range of about 130 points
since mid-August.
By mid-summer the interest rate outlook on both sides of the Atlantic
had improved dramatically with the Americans even managing a token
quarter-point cut in the Fed funds rate. This boosted bond markets,
whose fall from grace last year was the main factor behind a sharp
global retreat in share prices.
A rash of corporate takeovers has lent support to UK shares. The cash
these are generating in institutional pockets has to be reinvested in
the market.
But there have been misgivings on a number of fronts. With the economy
slowing down company results have disappointed City expectations and
there has been a regular stream of earnings downgradings on the back of
gloomy prospects identified by a number of major players.
Profit-taking in a highly rated New York stock market quickly
reveberates around the world. There are worries too about next month's
Budget.
These surfaced in September's gilt auction, which was not fully
covered by bids. The fear is that Kenneth Clarke will throw caution to
the winds in an effort to retrieve the Government's political fortunes.
This would be very bad news for financial markets.
But if he continues to make restoring order to the public finances his
number one priority, equities should benefit from either lower interest
rates or a pick-up in economic activity. Takeovers would provide the
icing on the cake.
Power play
ANY well run business faced with increasing competition will look to
diversify in order to generate alternative sources of income. British
Gas is no exception. Its decision to enter the electricity generation
market is not surprising despite the fact that it is an already crowded
marketplace which is not expected to show spectacular growth in the
future.
The generation market has evolved considerably since it was privatised
in 1990. The degree of success achieved in the liberalisation of the
generation market is demonstrated in the falling market share of the
dominant players, National Power and Powergen.
The electricity market is mature in England and Wales. Whilst British
Gas has a gas surplus that threatens to undermine its finances, the UK
already has a large surplus of generating capacity, estimated to be 30%
more than peak electricity demand. Recent evidence of a slowdown in
domestic economic growth suggests that there is little chance of this
surplus being used up in the near future.
However, even throughout the worst of the economic downturn
electricity demand has been very stable. Although industrial demand has
fallen, the commercial sector has been strong and demand from domestic
customers has been resilient.
Current projections suggest that future demand will rise. Forecasts
collected by the National Grid Company from the regional electricity
companies of England and Wales estimate compound demand growth at 1.3%
for each of the next six years, until 2001.
A total growth rate of 7.8% over this period is not a high growth
market.
However, senior company executives at British Gas believe that the
liberalisation of Britain's energy markets in 1998 will create
opportunities to sell gas and electricity as part of energy packages.
Further down the track, if it is successful in domestic electricity
generation then British Gas may care to look overseas where there is
enormous growth potential.
Around $500bn worth of projects are expected to be completed by the
year 2000.
Top post
OUT of the frying pan into the fire could be one way of describing
Bill Cockburn's decision to move from the Post Office to be group chief
executive of high street retailer W H Smith. The 52-year old Scot who
has spent his entire career in the postal service, succeeds Sir Malcolm
Field who retires on January 1.
Still, at least he has the compensation of a much higher salary,
#425,000, and no doubt perks such as share options, something that was
denied him following the Government's decision not to go ahead with Post
Office privatisation. Sir Malcolm earned #320,000 last year.
The appointment of plain-speaking Mr Cockburn marks a departure from
the urbane gentlemanly types who have long been associated with W H
Smith's boardroom. Mr Cockburn faces a tough challenge in repositioning
W H Smith in the face of competitive assaults in many of its product
areas and the likelihood of poor current trading.
W H Smith's profits fell last year from #124.8m to #115.3m, as the
company had expected, prompting many City analysts to recommend selling
the shares.
The continued poor state of the domestic DIY market has meant that it
has taken longer for the Do-It-All joint venture with Boots to return to
profit. A reinvigorated Texas under the ownership of Sainsbury/Homebase
will also put added pressure on the business.
The National Lottery has snipped away some of the discretionary
spending on magazines and newspapers. In addition, the large superstore
operators such as Asda and Tesco are taking a growing share of the
newspaper and stationery markets. The full effects of the recent
collapse of the Net Book Agreement on book sales in W H Smith in the
high street and the specialist Waterstones chain has yet to be
quantified.
However it is possible that W H Smith will experience both margin
attrition and possibly lower sales volumes.

Truancy is the product of a system failure, says Adrian Grant, as he
suggests some radical organisational changes to tackle the problem
SINCE Michael Forsyth, in his previous Scottish Office incarnation,
professed an interest in combatting truancy, the only result appears to
have been a superficial attempt to check class attendance and to publish
truancy tables.
Truants are those the system has failed, so an understanding of their
problems is surely the key to improving the system. Many truants are
reacting quite rationally and it behoves the educational establishment
to ensure, without compromising education, that such matters as school
organisation and the curriculum are designed to discourage truancy --
or, more constructively, to encourage attendance.
The focus for truancy is in third and fourth year of the secondary
school. Concentrating on this area will not only address the main part
of the problem, but also discourage second and even first year truants
because of a lack of role models. There are, I believe, organisational
factors which education authorities should address in the battle against
truancy.
* The examination structure:
The Munn and Dunning programme has encouraged truancy. Standard
Grades, though designed to extend provision to those for whom O Grades
did nothing, have failed. A weak candidate, especially, is easily
discouraged by substantial absence, failure to grasp part of a course,
or dropping behind through lack of suitable home study conditions. He or
she will come to the view that there's no more point in trying.
A short-term outlook on life afflicts many potential truants. The lure
of ''fun now'' is great when exams are a distant prospect -- more than
six weeks away. Succumbing to such a viewpoint can make it impossible
for pupils to catch up, leading to even more truancy.
To address these problems, all Standard Grade courses should be broken
down into modules. Satisfactory completion of individual modules would
give important experiences of success to low achievers which should act
as a spur to further effort. Satisfactory completion of a specified
package of modules should be sufficient to gain a Standard Grade four at
general level. Single written exams would then be sufficient to
discriminate between grades one, two, and three.
Exams should be set twice a year so that those who had not completed
the course in the summer could finish it off and sit an exam at
Christmas. Resits, with the hope of improving the grade, might well also
give more purpose to fifth-year Christmas leavers, perhaps even
encouraging them to continue in education.
* Class organisation:
Mixed-ability classes encourage truancy. Too many weak students are
under great peer pressure to use their spare time in and out of class as
directed by the group, even to perform badly in school. Potentially
willing students hate this -- and might even play truant to avoid the
pressure to underperform. Conversely, the poorer pupils are tempted to
play truant as they do not wish to be shown up in front of the class for
not being able to do the work.
The modern trend to 50- or 60-minute lessons and double periods
encourages truancy. Attention spans, particularly among the less able,
are very short -- around 20 minutes -- yet even these pupils are
typically asked to continue working for 60 or 80 minutes at a time and
for two hours without a break.
These problems could be greatly eased by moving ''backwards''. On the
one hand the use of setting pupils according to their ability in
different subjects rather than having them in mixed ability/behaviour
groups would allow the willing to get on. And the old pattern of having
a break after each set of two periods lasting a maximum of 40 minutes
each would match patterns of concentration more appropriately.
* Course choice:
Standard Grade courses have reduced course content choice for the less
able -- non-certificate classes are constrained by syllabi so arbitrary
that even teachers cannot justify the content when challenged, for
example, by a bored student. Often the content is completely irrelevant
to the majority of pupils concerned.
In the ''good old days'' ad hoc arrangements could be made for a
limited-ability pupil with a special aptitude to concentrate on that
area. The rigid attempt to force a ''balanced'' curriculum on an
unwilling pupil can lead to the pupil voting with his or her feet.
These problems could be substantially eased by cutting in half the
examinable part of course content and pairing subjects to give pupil
choice. If English and Science were paired over 400 minutes per week,
for example, the ''core'' would be 120 minutes each with 160 minutes at
the pupil's call to divide (or not) between the two.
* ''Family'' problems:
The fragmentaion of society in general and the breakdown of the family
in particular exacerbate truancy. Chaotic home circumstances can make
school seem utterly unreal and irrelevant to some pupils and extensive
absence results. Since individual circumstances are so varied, a
flexible approach is needed.
To try to address the individual problems of pupils, each school
should have a counsellor -- not a member of staff -- attached for
confidential advice.
In the curriculum, social and health classes should be expanded at all
levels and, beyond the age of 14, extended to full Standard Grade status
to allow the young people concerned a far better understanding of their
circumstances.
To make some provision for the social needs of youngsters whose
parents have failed, the Government must seek to undo the great damage
it has inflicted on the community life of the school by providing proper
funding -- overtime payments for teachers, for example -- to regenerate
such initiatives as extra-curricular activities and homework clubs.
Outside the school system, children's panels should be empowered to
require parents to take their responsibilities seriously. This could
include, for example, requiring parents to attend courses in
parentcraft. Wilful failure to abide by the terms of the order --
Contempt of the Panel -- could be treated as an offence to be dealt with
in court. Youngsters, too, should be empowered to take the initiative in
leaving an unhealthy family situation.
The engendering of fear and hectoring -- the Government's favourite
armoury -- may occasionally succeed in pushing a basically well-adjusted
person back on to the rails, but is counterproductive for dealing with
the hopelessness and pointlessness lying at the root of the serious,
chronic truancy which is a growing feature of our schools.

INCREASING efficiency is the way for the privatised water companies to
raise dividends, according to industry regulator Ian Byatt, the
director-general of water services.
He declared that the companies had little scope for raising dividends
''unless they are able to increase their efficiency above what is
allowed for in price limits.''
Writing in a report on financial performance and capital investment by
the industry, Mr Byatt said that if the companies do make higher profits
through greater efficiency they should consider how best to share this
with customers. His preferred option would be for them to reduce or
defer the price increases they are allowed under the regulatory formula.
Since privatisation in 1990 profits of the water companies have risen
by 40% in real terms, according to the report. Following a 17% rise to
#1700m last year, customers benefited from rebates of #250m, at the
expense of shareholders whose dividends dipped slightly to #825m.
''I have set price limits from 1995 on the basis that profits in
future would grow at a modest rate and that the return on capital would
fall to about half the current level in real terms over the next 10
years,'' Mr Byatt said.
Capital investment has continued to decline since the peak in 1991/92
when it reached #3400m. Last year it came to #2900m. Spending has slowed
because many of the early programmes, such as compliance with the Contol
of Pollution Act, have been completed and the expensive phase of the EU
Waste Water Directive has not yet been reached.
The director-general indicated he was concerned that the companies
might lose momentum in their capital investment programmes. He added:
''The drought has shown the need to provide a more reliable service for
customers; this should be done without any increase in prices.''
Yesterday Yorkshire Water said it was to apply to the Department of
the Environment for an emergency drought order following continuing dry
weather.

THE Trafalgar House engineering and shipping group has sold its
disastrous investment in the Emerald Producer floating oil rig for #21m.
That is just one sixth of the #120m it expected the rig to realise when
it was acquired as part of the Davy Corporation in 1991.
The buyer is a little-known Norwegian company, Seatankers Management,
and completion will be some time in the first half of next year.
Davy contracted to convert a conventional rig into a floating one in
1988, three years before its takeover. However, it ran into engineering
difficulties, while the client, Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, found
itself unable to pay, partly because of low oil prices.
Davy was then forced to charter out the rig to Midland &amp; Scottish to
extract oil from the small Emerald oil field, with the right to obtain
the full #120m purchase price.
When Trafalgar took over Davy, it paid an initial #60m with a further
#54m withheld until that amount was paid by Midland &amp; Scottish to Davy
under a letter of credit. The sum was never paid.
There were subsequent defaults on the charter payments and worse was
to follow as the life of the field was re-appraised downwards. Trafalgar
put the rig up for sale last year.
A Trafalgar spokesman said yesterday that it was not in the oil
production business and Emerald was a peripheral asset as far as it was
concerned.
The deal has been expected for some time as Trafalgar chief executive
Nigel Rich has been selling off the non-core activities. These included
The Ritz Hotel, bought by the Barclay brothers who are believed to be
favourites to buy The Scotsman and other Thomson Regional Newspaper
titles in Scotland.
There is speculation that the Cunard shipping interests including the
QE2 could be the next to go, even if they are regarded as a core
business.
Trafalgar shares firmed [1/2]p to 22[3/4]p.

Combined Districts U-21 9,
New Zealand U-21 12
AS an initial glimpse of what Scotland's prospects at under-21 level
this season are likely to be, last night's match at Bridgehaugh against
the New Zealand Rugby News under-21 side provided more than a note of
encouragement. That the Scots finally gave away a lead mattered little
at this stage in the season. What did emerge was the young Scots can
play with an equal amount of passion and commitment that is the hallmark
of Kiwi sides.
Especially encouraging for the Scottish coaches was the tackling of
the Combined Districts. In that area, they were given an exemplary lead
by GHK flanker Ian Sinclair.
Encouraging, too, was the solidity of the Scots front five who were
able to foil a couple of attempts at pushover scores by the New
Zealanders.
Rather disappointingly, the Scots did not use their possession to best
advantage behind the scrum. There were occasions when the ball could
have been moved wide to wingers Colin MacRobert and Graeme Smith. As it
was, both wings had to create their own chances and certainly made much
out of little.
The Combined Districts led 9-3 at half-time from three penalties by
the Heriot's fullback, Campbell Aitken, to one penalty by New Zealand
stand off Kerry Williams.
The Scots were put under greater pressure in the second half and the
New Zealand side got their reward with two more penalties by Williams to
level the scores and then two minutes from full time, after the Scots
were deemed to be offside, Williams kicked the winning penalty.

HYDRO-Electric, the Perth-based electricity generator and distributor,
refused to comment on speculation that it was about to sign an agreement
to take a stake in British Gas's proposed Seabank gas-fired power
station at Avonmouth near Bristol.
The construction of the 730MW station, proposed in 1992, would cost
about #300m. Construction could begin next year, with the facility
operational in 1998, when the residential gas and electricity markets
are due to be opened fully to competition.
It would not be surprising if Hydro-Electric did take a stake given
its considerable generation and supply business in England. The company
has access to electricity from a wide range of fuel sources. Its own
power stations are hydro, dual oil and gas and the Peterhead sour gas
station.
In addition, it has fixed contracts to purchase nuclear electricity
from Scottish Nuclear and to buy coal-fired electricity from
ScottishPower.
A spokeswoman for Hyro-Electric acknowledged that it was looking at
more than 10 possible business development projects. The company's
gearing is just 35% and it has said it would be comfortable with a rise
to 80%.
It is likely future growth will come from increased business in
England and Wales as that in Scotland suffers from real price
reductions. Already a quarter of its sales flow south of the Border.
British Gas's original partner in the Seabank scheme was Midlands
Power, a subsidiary of the Midlands regional electricity company which
is being bid for by Powergen, the smaller of the UK's two main
electricity generators. British Gas bought out the Midland stake this
year and currently owns 100% of the project.
Hydro-Electric's shares rose 2p to 341p yesterday.

SCOTLAND striker John McGinlay fired the goal which brought Bolton a
sweet victory over Arsenal on former Burnden Park manager Bruce Rioch's
return to Lancashire, then said: ''This can kick-start our season.''
Bolton's second win lifted them to third-bottom of the Premiership and
McGinlay, who struck after 35 minutes for the 1-0 win, said: ''We've
beaten both Blackburn and Arsenal, and hopefully we can go on to better
things. The atmosphere out there was great, what with Bruce coming back,
and the lads really rose to the occasion.
''It was a fine game and we can be satisfied to have beaten a team of
Arsenal's quality.''
McGinlay paid tribute to goalkeeper Keith Branagan -- ironically
Rioch's first signing when he took over as manager of Bolton -- saying:
''I thought he was brilliant. He kept us in the game.'' Branagan said:
''It was great to grind out a result. Bruce Rioch built a great side
here and we showed tonight we've still got the basis of it.''
Bolton's Serb debutant, #1.5m signing Sasa Curcic, added: ''I'm very
happy, and I think Bolton deserve a better place in the Premiership than
the one they have. Asked if he'd found the pace of the game tough,
Curcic replied: ''It was very fast, but for me, that is not a problem.''

ARSENAL have stepped up their bid to bring Paul Ince back to England
from Italy after Bruce Rioch suffered only the second defeat of his
Highbury reign on his first return to former club Bolton.
The Gunners have lodged an offer reported to be around #6.5m for the
former Manchester United midfielder who has failed to settle at Inter
Milan since his controversial summer move.Although they will face
competition, they are now favourites to sign the England player, and
they hope to complete the deal in the next fortnight.
Vice-chairman David Dein was in Milan at the weekend and Rioch
quipped: ''Yes, we've signed him,'' as he left Burnden Park, though
there are clearly many ends to be tied up first. It will take Rioch's
spending to close to #20m.
Dein had watched Ince earning some respite from the Italian press
after having helped Inter Milan to a 1-1 result against rivals AC Milan
in their Serie A derby.
Roy Hodgson, Inter's new English coach, won acclaim for the way he has
galvanised the side since his recent arrival in place of the sacked
Ottavio Bianchi. And Ince finally got some praise after scornful
assessments of his play since his arrival from Manchester United.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on a pioneering scheme to promote better
understanding between company and customer.
THE term ''fellowship'' tends to be associated in most people's minds
with university-related teaching awards but one of the UK's leading
engineering component manufacturers is about to pioneer a new
engineering fellowship scheme which, if successful, is likely to be
emulated by companies across the country which are interested in the
dissemination of best practice. The scheme, in principle, has the
support of LEIL and Forth Valley Enterprise, the two Local Enterprise
Companies.
The privately owned Taylor Group, a Scottish-based organisation with
three companies: Ductile &amp; Alloy Castings in Larbert, Taylor Dyecasting
at Dundee and Livingston Precision Engineering at West Lothian, will
introduce its new industrial fellowship scheme in April 1996, with the
aim of improving understanding and strengthening relationships between
the group's companies and their customers through bringing on board
recent graduate engineers or commercial trainees from some of its
customer organisations.
''We will be considering the manager at a career crossroads -- someone
who is perhaps facing redundancy and looking for an opportunity to
re-start his/her career -- as well as younger graduates on a development
programme who may see the three months' working spell within the Taylor
Group companies as slotting into their two/three year
induction/introduction to the business,'' explained Michael Willis,
chairman of Taylor Group Ductile &amp; Alloy Castings at Larbert.
Through their participation in the scheme, those engineers will
develop new skills, techniques and will witness best practice, all of
which can be taken back to their own organisations, but if it all sounds
very altruistic on the part of the Taylor Group, then Michael Willis is
quick to point out that the fellowship scheme will have benefits for
both sides.
''We are constantly thinking about what is best for the customer, but
we shall also benefit from our investment in terms of the projects they
would be working on, which will be of real practical advantage to us,''
he said.
''At the foundry, for example, we are looking to re-configure a whole
section of our production -- looking at re-siting of machinery, new work
methods -- and in many ways we need a project engineer to push that
through. Outsiders often have a clearer view of the business more
quickly than those involved. So this is not a paper exercise -- we do
want results for ourselves.''
Initially, each site will take one participant in the scheme, but it
is hoped that the fellowship will be extended to suppliers and perhaps
even competitors -- something which is very much in keeping with this
organisation's ideology.
A few weeks ago, The Taylor Group hosted one of the Inside Scottish
Industry schemes where a dozen companies within Scotland, earmarked as
offering best practice, invite other companies to see how they operate.
Fifteen companies attended the presentation whose theme was change
management, and evaluation of response was very positive.
''We made presentations and got dialogue going. Our aim was to try to
send people home with fresh ideas,'' said Michael Willis. ''Two of the
companies were competitive foundries and we were delighted to have them.
We have always thrown open our doors to competitors.''
The Taylor Group is a highly successful organisation, with markets in
the UK, Europe and Scandinavia, and in the US. It has a turnover of
#12.4m, and a history of good, solid, business know-how.
Founded in 1920 by Mr Robert Taylor, the organisation is still
privately-owned although only one family member -- his grandson and
namesake, group chairman Robert Taylor -- is still involved in the
day-to-day running of the business.
In total, there are 320 employees, 90 at the Larbert foundry, 170 at
Livingston and 40 at Dundee. Livingston Precision Engineering was
acquired three years ago and employment there has more than doubled
since then.
Although the operation back in 1920 was foundry-based, it moved into
different markets, producing castings for valves and eventually
developing its own product -- the Tay-Co Boiler -- one of the most
successful domestic boilers ever built in the UK.
Today, the theme is still metal, with a precision component output at
Dundee and Livingston and the traditional core business at Larbert, all
operating as independent business units but wholly owned by the company.
''We are sub-contractors in engineering and the theme is shaping
metal, whether it is a surround for a piece of equipment for Hewlett
Packard -- like an instrument case -- or a processing unit for an
Apricot Computer,'' explained Michael Willis. ''We have always seen
ourselves as a complete service operation -- everything from painting to
printing and into assembly, because we have the real pre-production
skills.''
The Livingston plant is working towards the Investors In People (IIP)
award at the moment, and there is emphasis on training and work groups
there at the moment. It will not be the first company in the group to
achieve this, however, since the foundry at Larbert was the first in the
country to attain BS5750 and IIP, and the first to be granted a licence
to produce ductile iron.
It was no accident that the traditional foundry-based company was the
first in the group to achieve these quality awards.
''In the iron-based industries there is little or no innovation in the
marketplace so it is necessary to create it yourself,'' Michael Willis
explained. ''We are constantly pushing new initiatives. Managers coming
in this industry are likely to be there for 30 or 40 years. Their skills
are not transferable, so it is important to try to keep up interest, to
have something to work towards.''
Apart from the quality awards, the new fellowship scheme and the
teaching company scheme (there is a student from the Czech Republic
participating in that at the moment), The Taylor Group is about to
launch a big recruitment campaign for graduates. They will be looking
for production engineers, mechanical engineers, electronic engineers and
metallurgists.
''We need to recruit graduates and our failure to do so is in part due
to ourselves and part due to a lacking in the students themselves. It is
difficult for graduates coming into a business where the more mature
managers have come up through non-graduate engineering. One problem can
be that they are very good, very bright but are too pushy early on, or
lack the necessary personal communication-type skills,'' Michael Willis
explained.
''We want engineers who have commercial minds -- engineers who have
had the practical training, who have all the logical, reasoning skills
but want to make money rather than seeing it as hobbyist engineering.''
Over the next five years, The Taylor Group is likely to expand further
and become even more profitable. It hopes to be able to do this through
the enterprise and skills of its workforce, by the ongoing pursuit of
best practice and by continuing to open its doors to everyone with an
interest in its operations, especially those graduate engineers and
commercial trainees so essential to the future of the organisation.
Michael Willis summed up: ''Hopefully people will want to come to us
because they know all about us.''

This week's tip comes from STEVEN HARRIER, the professional at Craigie
Hill Golf Club, Perth.
CRAIGIE Hill members are accustomed to playing from sloping lies, but
some handicap players have difficulty in playing from anything other
than a flat piece of ground.
This is because they do not take the slope into consideration, and try
to play from a normal address position and with a normal swing.
From a downhill lie, take one club less than required for the
distance. For example, if it is a No.7-iron shot in length, then take a
No.8, because the slope will result in closing the face.
At address, aim slightly left of target as the ball will fade in
flight and have the ball back in the stance (from any sloping lie always
position the ball towards the higher foot). Then tilt the body so that
it is perpendicular to the slope.
As with any swing, it is essential to maintain a steady head
throughout, and try and lean back into the slope -- this helps to
eliminate sway, which is a common error when playing from an uneven lie.
Having the ball too far forward at address and picking the club up too
steeply on the backswing are the everyday faults that cause poor shots
from downhill lies.
When playing from an uphill lie, follow the same tips in reverse --
one club less loft than normal, ball forward in stance and aim slightly
right.
But for both shots line up the body in sympathy with the slope, and
remember, plenty of practice will make playing from hilly lies become
second nature.
Just ask the Craigie Hill members.

<HEADLINE>Chairman and chief executive quit 'over management style' at fund managers. Two walk out in Dunedin upheaval</HEADLINE>

THE two top men at Dunedin Fund Managers, Scotland's second-largest
investment management house, have resigned in a sudden and major
boardroom upheaval.
Events at the end of last week culminated in the resignation of
chairman Hamish Leslie Melville, who will leave in two months' time, and
deputy chief executive Alan Kemp, who is going immediately.
News of the high-level departures came yesterday, after news of the
boardroom changes was broken to Dunedin's 150 staff in the morning.
There have been unconfirmed rumours of an ''unhappy relationship''
between the senior management team, comprising Mr Melville and Mr Kemp,
and Dunedin's largest shareholder, the British Linen Bank Group.
According to industry sources, the disagreement appeared to be over the
''management style'' at Edinburgh-based Dunedin.
British Linen Bank chief executive Eric Sanderson, who chairs Dunedin
Fund Managers' holding company, is stepping into the breach until a new
executive chairman is appointed.
In a statement, Dunedin said Mr Melville was resigning to devote more
time to the National Trust for Scotland, of which he is chairman, and
his other business interests. Mr Melville, who spent 15 years with
Hambros Bank, became Dunedin chairman three years ago.
Mr Sanderson said last night: ''Hamish has tendered his resignation.
He has a lot of other business interests. Alan has not been offered that
(job). I have come into that role meantime and Alan has resigned.''
The British Linen Bank chief executive appears to have been surprised
by the speed with which last week's events unfolded.
He said: ''It has arisen very suddenly and that is why my appointment
has been organised, because of the suddenness. It is really quite
unexpected to us.''
It is unclear whether it was felt Mr Melville had too many external
responsibilities or whether the chairman asked to be relieved of his
duties.
However, Mr Sanderson said the departures were not related to the
performance of Dunedin's funds.
With funds under management of #5600m, Dunedin is second in size in
its sector only to Baillie Gifford.
Its flagship, Edinburgh Investment Trust, is a #1000m-plus fund. It
also runs Dunedin Enterprise, Dunedin Income Growth, Dunedin Japan,
Dunedin Smaller Companies, and Dunedin Worldwide.
A senior official at another Edinburgh fund management house said last
night: ''It must be a major blow to Dunedin, who have shown quite
considerable growth in funds under management since Hamish and Alan took
over.''
However, Mr Sanderson said his appointment was made by the board of
Dunedin Fund Managers with the support of all the shareholders,
comprising British Linen Bank itself and the investment trusts.
He added: ''I have the advantage that I know all the people and have
their confidence.''
The unexpected resignations of Mr Melville and Mr Kemp follow hard on
the heels of the abrupt departure of Gordon Anderson, who was replaced
as Dunedin's investment director by Richard Muckart from Ivory &amp; Sime in
July.
It is not yet clear whether the new executive chairman will be an
external or internal appointment.

COLIN Montgomerie's weekend order of merit success in Valderrama was
of more than passing interest to Craig Grant from Dunbar. He is a member
of the four-man team rejoicing under the name of Paterson's Plonkers,
who are currently doing their level best to uphold Scotland's honour in
Portugal.
The six-handicapper will tell you without any apparent trace of regret
how their respective fortunes have turned out since, in 1979, over his
home course in the Scottish Boys' championsip, he showed a young
Montgomerie the way home with a 2 and 1 victory.
Grant is competing on the Costa Azul in the Transatlantic Cup,
highlight of the season of the little recognised Confederation of Golf
Societies. It is a prestigious enough tournament in its own right -- the
boys fought through Scottish qualifying to merit the coveted
expenses-paid trip -- but it is not exactly the Volvo Masters.
Why, then, is our golfing soldier of fate taking part in a tournament
run by a young and fast growing organisation with no official support to
speak of while Montgomerie is raking in the loot by the barrel-load?
''Well,'' replied the 32-year-old, ''I've lost a few pounds while he's
stayed the same weight.''
I suppose that's exactly the sort of answer you might expect from a
club golfer who is in Portugal for the crack just as much for the
competition.
He, like all team members, works at Torness Power Station. Captain
Neil Paterson has led his Plonkers from second qualifiers last year to
winners in Scotland this time round with a team total of 154 Stableford
points at Dalmahoy. He plays off 4, Jim Crawford claims 5, and Nigel
Haldane 12.
They are among the few who have official club handicaps, most of the
others in the 14 teams having been allocated marks by the
Confederation's own handicapping system, which allows for more rapid
changes than the CONGU version.
The Dunbar team improved to sixth place yesterday with 126 points over
tree-lined Aroeira, the course where Glasgow's Adam Hunter will defend
his Portuguese Open title next year. However, at 25 points behind the
overnight leaders, a team from the south-east of England presumptiously
called Eventual Winners, their chances of winning have all but
disappeared.
RULES CORNER
THE Transatlantic Cup will be won by the lowest aggregate score over
three rounds. Play is in groups of four with two players from the same
team in each group. Are players in the same team allowed to offer each
other advice?
* Much to the surprise of some players, the answer is no. Decision
8-1/22 rules that in this situation team-mates are fellow competitors
and not partners. Any advice given between them, such as remarks on club
selection, would carry a two-stroke penalty.

GROWTH in the narrow measure of the money supply appeared to slow in
October, but the figures were distorted by a sharp fall in bankers'
balances, its most volatile component.
M0, whose main constituent is notes and coins in circulation, rose by
just 0.3%, according to figures published yesterday by the Bank of
England. The annual rate of growth dropped back from 5.5% in September
to 5.2%.
But bankers' balances with the Bank of England fell by #42m. On their
own notes and coins increased by 0.5%, and the annual rate was unchanged
at 5.7%.
Narrow money growth peaked at 7.4% in October last year, and has been
slowing down gradually since as High Street sales have become stuck in a
rut. Nevertheless, it is still well above its monitoring range of 0% to
4%.
The latest figures provide the last economic indicator before the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, meet tomorrow.
But all the indications are that this potential inflation hazard is
well down the policy agenda. It is unlikely that the monetary aggregates
will play a significant part in the discussions between the two men.
The Governor has dropped his earlier insistence on the need for a rise
in interest rates in the face of mounting evidence that the pace of
economic activity has slowed down.
If the economy does not show signs of picking up again, the Chancellor
may demand a cut in rates, but not before his Budget, at the end of next
month, is out of the way.
But tomorrow's meeting is expected to pass off with both sides
agreeing that rates should be left on hold.
Economic opinion is now swinging towards the view that the next move
in rates will be downwards. Two leading City houses, Goldman Sachs and
James Capel, both discussed the prospects for lower rates in their
analysis of yesterday's money supply data.
James Capel's Adam Cole expects rates to remain on hold until the
first quarter of next year, ''when, after a relatively tight Budget and
with the peak in inflation in sight, interest rates can fall by 0.5%''.
He added that yesterday's money supply figues pointed to little
improvement in the recent soft trend in retail sales, with leisure
services likely to remain the main beneficiary of rising incomes and
consumer spending.
Goldman Sachs's Martin Brookes said that if consumer demand remained
muted ''inflationary pressures over the medium term were likely to ease
further, creating more scope for an easing in monetary policy in coming
months''.

* ANDREW Oldcorn, the Englishman who wants to be a Scot, is following
the old economic ethic of speculating to accumulate when he flies
Concorde to New York today en route to the $3m Gene Sarazen World Open
in Georgia.
Oldcorn, who qualified for the Sarazen extravaganza, which boasts a
$350,000 first prize, by winning the Jersey Open, suffered so badly from
jet-lag on his only previous trip to the States that he elected to spend
#4000 on air tickets in order to be fresh, alert and ready to challenge
Ernie Els for his title when the tournament begins on Thursday.
''I am going Concorde and returning first class,'' explained
Bolton-born Oldcorn, who will petition the European Tour to become an
official Scot on his return. ''I have lived in Edinburgh since I was 10
and consider myself Scottish, even although I played for England as an
amateur and won the English Amateur championship. I even support
Hearts.''
Oldcorn has just completed his best-ever campaign on the PGA European
Tour, winning more than #140,000, so he can well afford today's
supersonic Transatlantic crossing. Brian Barnes, meanwhile, arrived in
New York yesterday after a five-day crossing on the QE2.
Barnes, of course, choose a sea-crossing because of his phlebitis,
Oldcorn opted for the direct route because of convenience -- and the
fact that he is guaranteed a further #3000 simply for turning up at the
plush Chateas Elan complex just north of Atlanta.
Nice work of you can get it.

FLEMING Japanese Investment Trust has raised #42m through a placing
and offer of conversion shares, bringing total net assets of the trust
to more than #530m.
The issue of the conversion shares was formally approved by a
shareholder meeting yesterday. They are due to start trading today ahead
of conversion into ordinary shares on November 9.
Patrick Gifford, chairman of the trust managed by Robert Fleming, said
the amount raised was proof of growing investor interest in Japanese
equities following government measures to bring down interest rates,
weaken the yen and boost public spending
By the time the placing and open offer closed last Thursday, just over
42 million new shares had been subscribed.

CONSTRUCTION group John Mowlem has solved a major problem by selling
the London City Airport to Irishman Dermot Desmond for #14.5m. He is the
former chairman of Aer Rianta which operates Dublin Airport.
The net effect is that the construction and scaffolding hire group
will take a #5.5m charge in the current second half of its financial
year.
The airport was in the books with net assets of #19.8m and the
proceeds will be used in part to pay off direct borrowings, release
guarantees and also reduce Mowlem's own debt by #6m.
The airport was brilliant in concept. It was designed to provide a
short-haul facility within a short distance of the City of London to
service North-east European airports. But there were interminable delays
involving the building of the Docklands Light Railway and there were the
planning objections by local residents to the noise created by certain
aircraft types.
It eventually opened in 1987 but from the first day was bedevilled by
problems of access which kept passenger numbers at very low levels for
the first few years. That resulted inevitably in some carriers pulling
out or going bust and others having to be enticed to establish
themselves through being offered very low landing and servicing fees.
There are currently eight airlines operating from the site about seven
miles from the City. It is expected that the current year will see about
560,000 passengers, an improvement of a sixth over 1994.
For the passenger, it is almost ideal -- check-in times and waiting
are the shortest for any international airport in Britain.
However, after losing #6.1m in 1993, #4.2m last year and #1.3m in the
six months to June, Mowlem's chairman Ken Minton still did not see any
early improvement to reasonable profitability.
Altogether, the development has cost Mowlem #70m over the years in
direct investment, write-downs and losses charged against profits.
Mowlem shares reacted by rising 9p to 63p compared with the year's low
of 52p. That was seen after chief executive John Marshall departed on
October 20 following upon disagreements with chairman John Minton, who
also heads the Laporte chemicals group.

NICK Faldo and Bernhard Langer have both pulled out of this week's
Alfred Dunhill Masters in Indonesia.
''Both Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer have been forced to withdraw
because of family commitments,'' said the tournament organisers
yesterday.
Faldo last week declared that golf was ''no longer a priority'' after
it was confirmed he was splitting up from his second wife, Gill. He has
been linked with 20-year-old American student Brenna Cepelak.
He played in the #2m Tour Championship, which ended in Tulsa on Sunday
night, finishing 11 shots behind American winner Billy Mayfair.
Langer has been plagued by a back injury all season and said that he
planned to cut back on his schedule after the World Match Play
championship at Wentworth earlier this month.
Among those taking part in Jakarta are German Alexander Cejka --
winner of the final European Tour event, the Volvo Masters, in Spain --
Ian Woosnam, and Australians Ian-Baker Finch and Wayne Grady.

ALTHOUGH in one respect the European professional tour's season which
has just ended was disappointing and in another worrying, any year which
combines victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup match with
distinctive Scottish achievements and a satisfying proportion of
first-time winners has to be regarded as a success.
No-one who was there will readily forget the heightening tension and
that tumultuous last hour or so at Oak Hill -- the climax to a match in
which every European player made a contribution and in that most
pressurised form of the game to which all professionals are least
accustomed, responsible not for their own fortunes but for the team's.
To a lesser degree, but none the less welcome for that, the same was
true of Scotland's victory in the Alfred Dunhill Cup. Colin Montgomerie,
Sam Torrance, and Andrew Coltart supported one another through the
semi-final against Ireland to their defeat of Zimbabwe in the final,
which previous teams had reached twice before, only to lose to England.
But mainly golf is about individual performances and that was best
epitomised by the prolonged contest between Montgomerie and Torrance for
the order of merit title. The resolution of this duel between the two
Scots, in league only a week before, added spice to the final day of the
European season on Sunday at Valderrama.
The first of the reservations is that not since 1986 has a year gone
by without a British or continental professional winning one of the four
majors -- the Masters, the US and British Opens, or the US PGA
Championship, although in the last two, at St Andrews and the Riviera
Club, success agonisingly eluded Europe's grasp.
Costantino Rocca's improbable climactic putt from the Valley of Sin at
the Old course -- a coup de theatre worthy of the most melodramatic of
Italian operas -- took him into a tie for the Open with John Daly, only
for the flamboyantly coiffed and extravagantly over-swinging American to
destroy Rocca in their four-hole play-off.
A month later Montgomerie's rampant finish of three successive birdies
led to another tie, for the US PGA, with Australia's Steve Elkington.
But for the second consecutive year in a major the Scot lost in a
play-off, not over 18 holes as in the 1994 US Open, but at the first
hole of sudden death.
However, in the US Masters and the US Open, the European challenge
was, to say the least, muffled. Defending his title, Jose Maria Olazabal
finished equal fourteenth behind Ben Crenshaw, and Mark Roe, equal
thirteenth in the US Open adrift of Corey Pavin, was surely the least
likely of spearheads, especially since he was eventually to finish the
season No.126 on the European order of merit.
For once, too, the handful of players in their late thirties with
major victories to their credit were remote from the heat and burden of
the battle. Ian Woosnam, for whom this season was his least rewarding
for years, tied for seventeenth in the Masters and was equal
twenty-first in the US Open; Bernhard Langer was equal twenty-fourth in
the Open and Nick Faldo thirty-first in the US PGA.
Those two other stalwarts of former days of wine and roses, Severiano
Ballesteros and Sandy Lyle, continued to be even more invisible to the
naked eye. These subdued performances, therefore, inevitably raised
concern over the longer-term future, and the gap, with nagging
persistence, widened between these five players and their potential
successors.
Perhaps the best illustration of the problem is that when the 1997
Ryder Cup match is played at Valderrama, Ballesteros, Langer, and Faldo
will be 40, Lyle and Woosnam 39, and, of course, Torrance, Mark James,
and Howard Clark -- respectively 42, 41, and 41 when they contributed so
effectively at Oak Hill -- will be that much older too.
Apart from Montgomerie and Olazabal -- and who knows how or when the
latter's persistent foot injury will be sufficiently cured to make him
again a force to be reckoned with -- none of the professionals in their
late twenties or early thirties seems able to sustain his career.
Players like Barry Lane, David Gilford, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Peter
Baker, Joakim Haeggman, Steve Richardson, and Gordon Brand Jr come and
go -- although it could be argued in their defence that the competition
has now become deeper and the dedication to work hard at the game and
maintain a high level of physical fitness stronger.
Indeed almost a third of the 35 official tournaments were taken by
first-time winners, 11 to be exact, although four of them were
non-Europeans -- Americans Fred Couples and Peter Teravainen and Scott
Hoch, and the Australian Wayne Riley, who added the Scottish title to
his own country's Open four years before.
The one qualification surrounding these baptismal achievements was
that seven were gained in the season's first 12 tournaments, when the
leading European professionals either were not competing at all or were
on the US Tour preparing for the Masters. After their return in numbers
in the spring, precocity recognised its limitations.
Is this because players nowadays can be so surfeited with prize money
without having to undergo the pressures inextricably associated with
winning and the celebrity which follows? Or is it because they lack the
level of ambition which drives a Montgomerie to become ''every day and
in every way, better and better?''
What happens on the US Tour inevitably filters through to Europe and
for years now the complaint has been of the lack of dominating figures
across the Atlantic. The view from here is that, as the late Kingsley
Amis declared of the spread of higher education, ''more equals less'' so
also in professional golf.
All the same, as Henry Longhurst noted in the titles of two of his
books of anthology: ''It was good while it lasted,'' and ''I wouldn't
have missed it''. And, of course, in the final analysis there is always
Henry Cotton's tribute: ''Thanks for the game.''

SCOTLAND cricket chief Jim Love last night welcomed the historic
merger of two of the country's senior leagues.
Clubs in the East League and County Championship have agreed to join
forces from next season, and they claim that their new two-division
Scottish Cricket League will attract the country's top stars.
A spokesman for the new organisation said: ''This merger means that
we'll be creating a higher standard of league cricket than has ever been
played in Scotland. And the top clubs should be able to bring in new
talent from elsewhere.''
The move is sure to annoy clubs in the Western Union, who are planning
their own re-structuring but have always resisted a national league.
But Love, who will represent East League champions Heriot's in the new
set-up, believes his Scotland side could benefit. He said: ''This has to
be good news for Scotish cricket. It means more of our top players will
be playing at a higher level on a more regular basis.
''It would be nice to think that there could be a truly national
league one day, with representation from the west. But change takes time
and this is at least a significant step forward.
''I'm sure standards will improve and that will have a knock-on effect
for the national side.''
Heriot's will be joined by old rivals Grange, Carlton, Watsonians, and
Freuchie in the top division, while the county representatives are
Aberdeenshire, Arbroath, Ayrshire, Strathmore, and West Lothian.

ENGLAND have abandoned their attempt to change Devon Malcolm's bowling
action -- and challenged him to prove he's worth a Test place doing it
his way.
Manager Ray Illingworth and coach Peter Lever had briefly pulled him
out of the contest against an Invitation XI at Soweto Oval -- yesterday
abandoned as a draw because of rain -- so he could practise in the nets.
But Illingworth warned: ''He's got to show me now he's in the best three
seamers here, bowling as he has always bowled.''
England plan to omit him from the game against Border in East London,
starting on Thursday, leaving Malcolm just next week's match with South
Africa A at Kimberley to earn a place for the first Test on November 16.
* PAKISTAN, chasing a victory target of 428, suffered an early setback
in their four-day tour match in Perth yesterday.
Western Australia declared their second innings on 189 for seven and
the tourists lost Aamir Sohail to finish on 54 for one.
But a boost for the tourists came when fast bowler Waqar Younis
returned to action during the afternoon after resting a hamstring injury
on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council will not comment for a
week on criticism from Australia over the bribery charges made by three
Australian players against Salim Malik. The ICC said yesterday that only
chief executive David Richards, currently in America, was authorised to
speak to the media.
Malik yesterday flew to join the Pakistan team in Perth.

THE result of what has been billed as Britain's biggest sport's
contest of the year, played out behind closed doors by five rivals last
week, will be announced today. Scots can be forgiven for having remained
aloof from the war games as five English cities have fought for a mega
slice of National Lottery money and the right to build what they are
wont to describe as the National Stadium.
Justifiably, Scots are more preoccupied by Hampden's application for
#33.5m from the Millennium Fund, half of the cost of upgrading, and by
another Millennium bid, for a national indoor arena at Glasgow Green,
which was spiked.
All this while the Greater London area greedily guzzles lottery
largesse -- a quarter of UK total funds allocated so far, including #55m
for the Royal Opera House, #30m for Sadler's Wells, and #12m for
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
''Hampden is still being assessed by the Millennium commissioners,''
confirms the Scottish Sports Council's chief executive, Allan Alstead.
''It's still very much in the running, and we are hopeful.''
But a heavy sport-political agenda which embraces Britain staging the
2001 World Athletics Championships, football World Cup in 2006, and even
the 2008 Olympic Games, will ensure that London remains the main lottery
benefactor.
The legitimacy of Scottish claims is substantiated by a recent survey
commissioned by the Directory for Social Change. Figures up to October
16 -- admittedly before last week's #17m charity bonanza -- show that
while Greater London, with 26% of the UK population, has received #141m,
or #20.74 per head of population, from the lottery, Scotland overall
received just #10.95 per head. Lothian got #16.01 per capita, and
Strathclyde just #3.15.
So surely the balance must tilt? London's four rival stadium
contenders -- Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Bradford -- think
likewise. But they will almost certainly be disappointed. London remains
favourite to land the #200m project.
Each of the five cities presented their case last Thursday and Friday
to the 10-strong Sports Council national stadium steering group, which
comprised senior officials from the major sports which would use the
stadium: football, rugby league, and athletics.
The last of these is not even guaranteed to feature in the stadium
plans. Their representative, British Athletic Federation chairman Peter
Radford, admits to having fought a furious action, and it is not yet
known whether he has been successful.
The London lobby would have you believe that only they can make a
credible case. Their logic is that thrice in succession, British Olympic
bids have foundered: first Birmingham, then Manchester, twice. It is no
secret that many of the International Olympic Committee delegates could
not accept any UK city other than London as a credible host.
The British Olympic Association are clandestinely canvassing for
London. Their stadium hopes centre on demolition of the whole Wembley
complex.
But athletics chief Radford has laboured to convince majority football
interests that the intimacy of a traditional soccer stadium should be
sacrificed in order that a track be accommodated. Technology is flexible
enough to assure this, and to allow major boxing and other events
besides.
If -- when -- Wembley gets the nod, Manchester will scream betrayal.
They hope for lottery money to help build the stadium to house the 2002
Commonwealth Games.
Meantime, Scottish players in the lottery ring display confidence,
though that has proved misplaced before.
Glasgow failed with a Millennium Fund application for #45m towards a
Glasgow Green regeneration project costing #78m, #30m of which would
have been spent on an indoor national arena. It would have catered for a
range of sports including athletics, ice events, boxing, gymnastics,
tennis, and badminton, as well as theatre and concerts. Alongside was a
centre of football excellence, on the site of the so-called Fifty
Pitches.
They were rejected, though not terminally. Brian Porteous, depute
director of Glasgow Parks and Recreation Department, revealed they have
now been encouraged by the Millennium Commission to reapply. ''The
application will be done next month,'' he said. ''We will be
resubmitting a reworked application.
''We have been given commission guidance on the resubmission, and hope
this time it will be included. An architect's competition is already
under way on a design for the 12,000-capacity indoor arena.
''You ask if we are optimistic? I can only say that such an arena is a
priority for Scotland, and we have the support of a range of agencies,
including the Scottish Sports Council, Scottish Arts Council, and
Scottish Tourist Board.''
Despite large grants in Scotland -- including #670,000 to Scotstoun;
#280,000 for a Glasgow swimming pool; #50,000 for a tennis centre at
Cambuslang; #49,000 for rowing in Glasgow; #275,000 for the Battery Park
in Greenock; #239,000 for Ayrshire cricket; #500,000 for ice sport at
Prestwick; #750,000 for a centre at Oban; #760,000 for a pool at
Inverness, and #600,000 for a recreation development at Crieff -- the
data suggests Scottish sport is still being short-changed by the
lottery.
Not by the Lottery Sports Fund perhaps, but certainly regarding
Millennium Commission benefits.
England's National Stadium bidders:
LONDON: Only Wembley's twin towers would survive after a #160m
facelift. England would play internationals on a ''floating'' pitch in
front of 80,000. To accommodate athletics, 20,000 seats would disappear
at the press of a button to reveal a track.
MANCHESTER: A #150m state-of-the-art stadium, planned for Eastlands,
the city's purpose-built sport and leisure park. The opening and closing
ceremonies for the Commonwealth Games will be here. The athletics world
governing body was consulted in compiling the specifications. Capacity:
80,000.
BIRMINGHAM: ''Green'' stadium set in a natural amphitheatre, next to
the National Exhibition Centre with rapid access to motorways, airport,
and rail station. Cost is #150m and capacity 85,000, with 65,000 for
athletics using retractable lower-tier seating.
SHEFFIELD: Don Valley Stadium staged World Student Games and major
athletics meetings since. Proposal to double 25,000 capacity, with
possibility of 80,000. Cost: #80m. Alternative plan for separate stadium
for soccer and rugby league.
BRADFORD: Sliding roof would allow all-year-round events at Odsal.
Cost #200m, as part of vast shopping and entertainment complex. Only
#40m sought from Lottery fund. Capacity: 80,000.

ATHENS-born entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the man who made the
airline industry stand up and take note when he launched easyJet's #29
single fare between Scotland and London two weeks ago, would appear to
have ruffled a few feathers.
Anonymous calls have been placed in recent days to newspapers in
London, alerting them to a fatal explosion on board one of his father's
oil tankers while Stelios worked for the company four years ago.
Where the telephone calls came from remains a mystery but they are
perhaps testimony to the boldness of Stelios's airline venture.
Like Peter Wood's Direct Line insurance operation, 28-year-old
Stelios's easyJet Airline Company cuts out the middleman, in this case
the travel agent.
It also prompted British Midland and Air UK to cut their cheapest
return fares to match easyJet's, although Stelios stresses that his
company's #29 single fares offer passengers more flexibility as they do
not involve conditions such as a Saturday night stay-over.
Ryanair, which built its reputation on its Eire service, is also
putting pressure on the major airlines, having launched a
Prestwick-Stansted service for as little as #59 return. However, to
qualify for the cheapest ticket, travellers must spend a Saturday night
or two other nights in London.
easyJet's #29 fare will only apply to about 40% of seats filled.
Single tickets will also be sold at #39, #49, and #59, depending on
availability.
The outstanding court case in Italy relating to the explosion there on
board the ''Haven'' does not, even in the eyes of the Civil Aviation
Authority, have any bearing on the easyJet venture. The new company's
flights, from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London Luton Airport, are
operated by GB Airways, which is also a franchisee of British Airways.
If easyJet ultimately expanded, bought its own planes and applied for
its own operators' licence, its suitability would be judged on criteria
such as the adequacy of its engineering and maintenance back-up.
easyJet executive chairman Stelios is open about the Italian incident,
which resulted in the death of five employees of his father's
Athens-based company, Troodos.
He says: ''I am extremely sorry about it. It was a lesson well learned
from many points of view and has made me determined to run only the
safest of operations.
''easyJet flights are operated by GB Airways, which is a franchisee of
British Airways, so as far as I am concerned the safety standards are
the highest in the industry.''
Stelios is well aware of the low survival rate of companies awarded an
Air Travel Organisers Licence by the Civil Aviation Authority but
believes, with the backing of his family's wealth, easyJet will not
fail.
He has earmarked #1m for the high-profile launch of easyJet, which
encompasses a major newspaper and television advertising campaign.
The Civil Aviation Authority is happy with easyJet's #5m of capital,
#1.5m of which is lodged as a bond so customers will not lose out in the
event of a collapse. It is also satisfied with the strength of easyJet's
management.
Stelios would appear to have inherited the entrepreneurial spirit of
his father, Loucas.
He says: ''My father is a self-made man. He was born in Cyprus out of
a very poor family, one of 12 children.
''His first trip abroad was to go and live in Saudi Arabia, which in
those days was the land of opportunity. That was how he made his first
money as a shipping agent and then, when he had put enough money
together to buy a little ship, he came to London and bought a ship in
1959.''
Loucas started his fleet -- which was 53-strong in its heyday and now
numbers about 25 tankers -- with the purchase of one of the Liberty
Ships used by the Allies in the Second World War.
Stelios, a British citizen and graduate of the London School of
Economics and the City University Business School, worked for his
father's company for four years before deciding to set up on his own.
Three years ago, aged only 25, he set up Stelmar Tankers, which
carries ''clean'' petroleum products. It was one of the first companies
of its kind in the world to obtain the BS5750 and ISO9002 international
quality certification standards.
Stelmar Tankers, with a five-strong fleet valued at $150m (#95m),
employs about 320 people.
Explaining his move into the airline business, Stelios says: ''Being
of, I suppose, a nature that likes challenge, I decided that (Stelmar)
was not enough and that I would like to take on another challenge.''
His first encounter with the airline industry came when Greek company
South-East European, a start-up venture flying between Athens and London
under the Virgin Atlantic colours, asked him if he would like to invest.
He says: ''I looked at their business plan and thank God I didn't
invest because they went bust.
''The first wise decision I made in the airline industry was not to
invest in it.''
The Athens-London service is now operated by Virgin itself. Stelios
has discussed his own plans with Virgin maestro Richard Branson.
Stelios then went to the US, where he discovered the most successful
airlines were the ''low-cost carriers, the peanut airlines''.
He visited the rapidly-expanding, Atlanta-based Valujet, which dared
to take on the mighty Delta. Stelios considers Valujet ''probably the
most successful recent start-up in aviation history''.
He says: ''I got to know the shareholders and the chairman, Robert
Priddy, and he was kind enough to let me understand how the whole
concept works.''

Dr Margot Baird has won success from hard times. Anvar Khan profiles a
woman of substance.
THE beginning of someone's life is supposed to influence the end, and
that is the tragedy. But not everyone wants to swap their only life to
entertain the hang-ups of their parents. The victim has a choice, either
to go professional or remain anonymous.
Unless she makes an exhibition of her problems, you've no idea what a
woman has gone through.
Dr Margot Baird, 48, has the accolade of being a member of the elite
Westminster Dining Club, a talking shop for the UK's top women business
people and academics. She recently won a #35,000 research grant to
investigate the flexibility of wool as a product for industry. She's won
awards, travels the world, and works as a lecturer at the Scottish
College of Textiles in Galashiels.
Baird knows things. When I blundered that I thought different wool
came from different living mutton, she exuded air in a curious mix of a
laugh and a sigh, and informed me that its flexibility was due to work
such as hers.
But I am not an expert on sheep or wool. I am a journalist, a jack of
all subjects; a compromising position which never fails to embarrass me.
To get the full picture of Baird you have to remember the girl who got
nothing from her father other than approval. He valued education, but in
the way of most possessive fathers wanted a bright pupil to double as a
docile daughter. He was a control-freak.
She knew that if she went her own way, it would be at the cost of an
already tenuous relationship. Her father should have known that you
can't give a child an open-mind and ask her to play ignorant at home.
She didn't -- that's why she's one of the few women today to have dined
with the Cabinet.
''I was born in a single-end, brought up in a house that didn't have a
bathroom. I was my dad's favourite, so I didn't really get any affection
from my mother.''
A woman has to take responsibility for her part in an unhappy
relationship. Why stay with a man when you no longer love him? Why
settle for less? This could have been the case for Baird's mother.
There was never any money in the house. She rowed about it. To Baird
financial independence became a priority. She learned that an income
gives a woman the freedom to decide what she does or does not take from
a man. Baird decided to earn for herself and left home to go to
university.
Unfortunately, at 19, she knew the value of education but didn't value
herself. Subsequently, she married the first man who swept her off her
feet. But worse still, because she had always felt downtrodden by her
family, in a cruel, tragi-comic twist, she interpreted her fiance's
habit of slagging off his parents as a sign of the strength of character
she wanted.
''My first husband thought I was the greatest thing since sliced
bread. Before I knew where I was, I had been persuaded to take a year
out, get a job, get married, get a flat, get set up, and after a year I
could go back to studying. I thought, okay.''
When you feel like an outsider it's nice to be wanted. But selfish
people never have any manners. Her father threw him out the house. In a
scene from a silent melodrama, she cried: ''If you persist, I'm going
with him.''
His parents, however, swiftly accepted the engagement. She was married
within three weeks. ''We got a flat, I got a job, we got married, moved
in, and it all changed.''
There was a sinister reason for her fiance's parents' support. Baird
was going to marry a 21-year-old man with a history of mental illness.
His parents didn't tell her. At last, here was someone who would look
after him.
''I'd say get up and help me with the dishes and he wouldn't. And a
little argument became blown up into something more by his withdrawal. I
thought, 'Oh God, my father's trick that!' Then silence. He had black
moods about how the whole world was on his back and didn't appreciate
him.
''I was trying to put all this together, thinking 'Who is this
person?'. I had given up everything, my whole known world, with nobody
speaking to me, and now in these four walls with you, what has
happened?''
Six weeks after they married, Baird became ill. She was pregnant. It
was a bad couple of months. She went into hospital suffering from
dehydration. Suddenly, her husband developed a fickle relationship with
the world of work.
''When I was home, recovering, he would take a morning or an afternoon
off. I wasn't earning at the time. Here we are again, I thought, just
like my parents, money problems. Then he started to read books about how
to bring up children and how to behave when pregnant.
''I'm thinking: 'Christ, I wish I could have a miscarriage, I wish I
could have an abortion.' Couldn't even mention it. On top of that, the
arguments were increasing and the threat of violence was definitely
there.''
In truth, Baird has made a success of her life despite being beaten up
by her husband, despite feeling unloved as a child.
''I'd be lying in bed and would wake up, and this voice was asking me
questions. When I asked him what he was doing, he would say he was
trying to find out the truth of the matter. I was getting pretty jittery
by now.
''The money problems were increasing and he'd had a couple of go's
about giving me a belt around the ear.
''One day he came home in May and said, 'I've quit my job. They
wouldn't give me a rise.' I was over six months pregnant. We now had no
income. And he was at home all the time.
''The last two or three months of that pregnancy were awful. He was
extremely violent towards me. I recall one occasion when he pinned me
down onto the floor, and went on about 'if anything happens to this
baby', and I'm saying, 'Well, don't hit me, don't hit me'. There was
nobody I could go to.''
Her husband didn't get a job until her daughter was six-months-old and
it was in Teeside. He had an inflated opinion of his own value and was
applying for the wrong kind.
''I was witless by this time, and all I seemed to do was carry this
little bundle that was my own, and make sure that she was okay.''
Baird moved as he moved from job to job, finally to rooms with shared
facilities. She ran out into the street once, absolutely beside herself,
after a particularly bad row. Scared to go back, scared not to. She
shakes a little and blushes as she recalls the night that changed her
life for the better.
''At the end of the street was a church. I ran up to the door of what
I thought was the manse, knocked and an elderly lady answered. 'I'll see
if the Father is in,' she said. It was a Roman Catholic church. I told
him everything.''
The Catholic Church has had a bad press recently but this Father
turned out to be a diplomatic purveyor of common sense. He turned to
Baird and said: ''What you need is a job.''
They had a look at his copy of the Manchester Evening News and spotted
one. Baird stayed married and went back into education part-time.
''I worked, he worked, and I studied. Things calmed. All this had to
be done. That became my philosophy of life. With the income coming in we
purchased a wee house, a car, a holiday. I was running the house, I was
earning my own money.
''He didn't like that very much, certainly not that I had the
beginnings of my confidence back, that I began to stick up for myself. I
got stronger and stronger.''
BAIRD got a promotion, her husband resorted to opting out. ''I
remember turning round to him and saying, ''Give up your job if you
like, but you'll not eat much, you'll not smoke much . . .
'Och, well', he said, 'I don't care about you anymore. In fact, I've
been seeing someone else.' ''
It was at this point, that Baird snapped. Not, she says, because of
his infidelity, but because she was scared of what she might have caught
from him. Yes, their relationship was that bad.
If she didn't believe him, he said, call this number. ''I did phone,
and a woman did answer, who eventually told me she had been seeing
him.'' It was soon after that confrontation, that Baird returned home
one day to find her husband unusually and absolutely drunk.
''I was terrified. The violence, the threatening, the arguing had
stopped working. This was the beginning of a new tack. I couldn't take
it. I went and collected my daughter, got her fed and put her to bed. He
came round. He had consumed a whole bottle of whisky. He puked up. I got
him back into bed, waited until he was asleep, removed the car keys,
wrapped the child in a blanket, put her in the back of the car and drove
all the way from Manchester to Blantyre to my parents' house that very
night.
''God knows what he would have been capable of with drink; he was bad
enough without it. We went straight to bed and we never went back. We
never saw him again.''
Baird brought up her four-year-old on her own. It was only when her
daughter made her own inquiries that she learned two years ago that her
ex-husband had died a penniless schizophrenic, neglected and
unrecognisable, a bad advert for care in the community. She had spent
unnecessary years as a punchbag, but she knew that already.
I had given up everything, my whole known world, with nobody speaking
to me

A SCOTTISH potato group is aiming to shadow the Potato Marketing
Board's plan to double exports by the end of the decade.
The PMB target, unveiled at a board export seminar in Cambridgeshire,
is to increase British ware from a five-year rolling average of 100,000
tonnes a year in 1995 to 200,000 tonnes by the year 2000 and to improve
the value added.
Seed potato specialist company Gordon &amp; Innes of Elgin, Morayshire, is
aiming to double its turnover of around #8m a year in the same period
with a greater weighting on export opportunities.
The signs are positive for both initiatives. British ware exports
virtually doubled to more than 200,000 tonnes in the past year alone,
due to acute shortages in continental Europe and elsewhere.
In the past five years, Gordon &amp; Innes has more than doubled its
through-put, handling 25,000 tonnes of seed last year. Exports have
soared from between 2000 and 3000 tonnes to nearly 10,000 tonnes with
another jump in the past year, according to commercial director Alistair
Roy.
There is no secret formula for success in either field, as both Mr Roy
and Alan Avison of the Lincolnshire-based ware export award winner A&amp;C
Exports pointed out. It is down to hard work, attention to detail,
knowing the language and personal contact.
''This year I have been abroad for 30 weeks and been in 19 countries
in Europe, the Eastern bloc, the Far East, and everywhere in between,''
said Mr Roy. ''We have been working in Estonia for three years and in
other Baltic states. We have been looking at Austria which has recently
joined the EU and we believe a lot of business could be done with
Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary.''
One problem he foresees this year is getting enough seed to satisfy
existing customers let alone develop new markets. Ware producers face a
different problem, according the PMB's Richard Dadson, who estimates
Europe has one million tonnes more potatoes this year than last.
Mr Roy also predicts a growing threat from the trade in uncertified
seed or small ware threatening to undermine both today's market and
future developments.
''Breeders and controllers of varieties are not going to risk having
their varieties grown in Scotland if there are people who are going to
try to pirate them. Our opinion of people who do this is that they are
nothing short of criminals.''
He said that breeders were not going to get fat on royalty rates. ''In
fact, they barely cover the cost of breeding. That is why breeding
companies get involved in marketing these varieties.''
Gordon &amp; Innes has spent the last 10 years developing new varieties at
its Huntly micro-propagation unit as well as running trials on 80
varieties across England through its plant in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is
now ready to submit one or two new varieties for official national
testing.
''This means we will have gone through 11 years of work, expenditure
and effort. Therefore, you can understand why we would not be very happy
if these varieties were pirated,'' Mr Roy added.
* THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland has called for a ban on the
import of Dutch seed potatoes in the wake of reports of an outbreak of
brown rot in the Netherlands. The Scottish Office agriculture department
has already asked importers of seed to delay shipments while it seeks
more details from the Dutch authorities.
Bill Reid, NFUS potato convener, said if the Dutch could not give
Scottish producers the necessary reassurances an import ban should be
imposed. Brown rot reduces crop yields by rotting tubers. Legislation
demands that seed potatoes should be grown in an area known to be free
from the disease.

* BARGAIN basement Christmas cheer from those nice folk at Asda, who
are knocking down the prices on 19 childrens' annuals. Eric Cantona and
Ryan Giggs, worth a conservative #15m between them to Manchester United,
are on offer at just #3.99 each, down from the original #5.25. They're
now in the same league as those other twentieth-century heroes Action
Man, East 17, and Rupert Bear, whose habit of speaking in impenetrably
bad rhyme puts him automatically on the same shelf as the French
footballer. Alas, the Broons will be gracing no stockings in England
this year; their annual, at #3.19, is available in Scotland only (Asda
obviously hasn't noticed the millions of Scots south of the Border).
* BLOCKBUSTER: not so much a humble video rental shop as a complete
home entertainment concept, as Check-In was alarmed to discover on
phoning the company's head office. In its new TV advertising campaign
Blockbuster claims you have more chance of getting hold of a copy of
Outbreak, for example, at its stores, shining brightly in blue and
yellow on a high street near you, because the company buys in more
copies of new films than anyone else. Maybe that explains why the choice
of any other sort of film is so limited, in this researcher's
experience. A case of never mind the quality, feel the width? Not at
all, said the company's charming PR woman Phillida. We jolly well do
have back-catalogue, and where else would you get Haagen Daazs icecream,
computer games, popcorn and Twix bars at midnight? ''You go into the one
store and get your entertainment for the whole evening.''
* A REAR action campaign will be fought at SIT 95 -- that ever-popular
exhibition of contemporary seating, booking now for November 28-30 at
the London Business Design Centre -- to elevate neglected female chair
designers from ''their frequent peripheral position within this male
dominated field''. Sounds tremendously uncomfortable, especially as the
womanly seating designs on offer in the special exhibition, A Gender
Specified, include ''the funky recycled plastic furniture of Jane
Atfield''. Not something I'd choose to curl up in for an episode of
Brookside, that's for sure.
* PARENTS at Work, the concerned people behind a November conference
in London entitled, Time, Work and the Family, which will examine
whether today's latchkey children have a ''parenting deficit'' (as
opposed, perhaps, to life-threatening drug habits or nits, the more
usual concerns), have exercised admirable restraint in timetabling the
speakers who will unravel the complexities of modern employment. Joanna
Foster is given a crisp 15 minutes to Welcome everybody at 11.15, Lucy
Daniels has a mere half hour to report on Long Hours research at 12.30,
and the closing session examines 'Where do we go from here, how will the
working parents of the future reconcile time, work and the family?' in a
breathtaking 30 minutes, starting at 3.30pm. All done and dusted by 4pm
in time for tea and the school run.
* PROBLEMS at home? Share them with your work colleagues -- chances
are they haven't heard anything so interesting in ages. It seems that
Scots hate talking about their home life in the office, according to the
BT Forum survey of communication skills in the UK. You've guessed the
rest: it's good to talk, and this message will be plugged at a
conference on the issue at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow on
Thursday. After all, while they're busily unloading all that domestic
grief and gossip in the canteens down south, we have to content
ourselves with the latest soap opera plots or speculation on who did it
in Cracker. When all the time it's murder at home . . .

JOHN DAVIDSON, in New York, joins the celebrations as the Versaces
branch out
THE Versace experience has touched down in midtown Manhattan. For
ahead of Planet Earth's biggest Versace boutique throwing open its Fifth
Avenue doors, the calendar of New York designer shows (previewing
collections for next spring) began on Saturday evening in a runway
frenzy of Dayglo stripes, colourful checks, and floral prints as
charming as the kitchen curtains in the Walton homestead.
This was Versus -- the youthful secondary line from Gianni Versace,
which is now officially ''managed'' by the great man's sister,
Donatella. And what a show it was. Twin towers of video screens rose
from the runway like Manhattan skyscrapers. The music was hot, as was
the tented venue -- packed to capacity. Calvin and Kelly Klein were
there. So too were Donald and Marla (Maples) Trump and several charming
young out-of-towners posed for eager lensmen in front row seats before
retiring to their alloted positions around row Z.
Any party hosted by Donatella Versace demands attendance and so, much
later on Saturday evening, a few thousand of the blonde bombshell's
closest fashion world intimates converged on Twilo -- a cavernous
nightclub right on the very edge of Manhattan.
Everyone who is no-one in particular was therewith a sprinkling of
celebrities like little Kate Moss and big Stella Tennant. Also there
were star photographers Stephen Miesel and Ellen von Unwerth, fellow
designer Anna Sui, and singers Patti LaBelle and Luther Vandross.
Kirsty Hume arrived in the gold-meshed hipsters which she had worn
earlier in the show. But in case you think, even for Kirsty, there is
any such thing as a free pair of trousers, reflect that she was required
to pose for paparazzi lensmen with Donovan Leitch spread across her lap.
There may perhaps not have been quite as many Donatella blonde clones
that would have surfaced at any similar extravaganza in Milan, but there
was certainly a liberal splattering of her big brother's jeans and
chequer-board shift dresses. Liberal too was the flow of free champagne.
Perhaps this somehow explains the cobalt blue paint which the gentlemen
of the great British press later discovered had been streaked across
their very best black trousers. The Versace experience always leaves its
mark.

TRAVADO can get his season off to the ideal start today by gaining a
repeat success in the Plymouth Gin Haldon Gold Challenge Cup at Exeter.
Nicky Henderson's nine-year-old, winner of the 1994 Arkle Challenge
Trophy, put himself very much in the picture for the Queen Mother
Champion Chase with his success here 12 months ago, making most of the
running to register a comfortable three-length victory over Absalom's
Lady.
From that point, however, things did not go quite as planned. He
followed his Exeter win with a respectable second to Viking Flagship in
Sandown's Tingle Creek Chase, but came down seven from home in the King
George VI at Kempton on Boxing Day.
Travado went off at 9-2 for the Queen Mother and, on paper, his
tailed-off last of the nine finishers does not make inspiring reading.
However, that does not tell the whole story, as he was well in
contention when making a bad blunder at the eighth fence, which cost him
his chance.
Jenny Pitman, fresh from Saturday's success with Egypt Mill Prince,
should be on the mark with Celtic Laird in the Whitbread Novices'
Handicap Chase. The Celtic Cone gelding showed modest form when
campaigned at around two miles but the step-up to two miles and six
furlongs at Worcester last time worked the oracle as he ran out the
three-length winner of a novice handicap chase.
* MARK Johnston left for Australia last night to supervise Double
Trigger's final preparations to land the Melbourne Cup on November 7.
The trainer reports all is going to plan with his Ascot Gold Cup
winner. ''The horse is fine and everything seems very well,'' he said.
''But we said that about Quick Ransom last year and look what
happened.''
Quick Ransom, now trained Down Under by Lee Freedman and one of Double
Trigger's rivals in next week's race, finished twenty-third of 24
runners, behind the former Geoff Wragg-trained Jeune, last year.
* GROUND conditions are the key to which of David Nicholson's trio of
entries will run in the Tote Silver Trophy Handicap Hurdle at Chepstow
on Saturday.
Nicholson has a record second to none in the two-and-half-mile event,
having saddled Mighty Mogul to win in 1992, Triple Witching to repeat
the feat a year later, and Hebridean, who was runner-up to Her Honour
last year.
Hebridean, a 16-1 chance with the sponsors to go one better this time,
is the outsider of the three Nicholson runners with Putty Road available
at 8-1 and Anzum a 10-1 chance. But Nicholson will not make a decision
on who will represent Jackdaws Castle until nearer the weekend.
''I don't want to mislead anybody and it will be down to the ground as
to which of them runs,'' he said.
* IRISH champion trainer-elect John Oxx and stable jockey John Murtagh
followed up their Breeders' Cup triumph with Ridgewood Pearl with a
four-timer at Leopardstown yesterday.
After taking both divisions of the juvenile maiden with Lady Clague's
home-breds Key Change and Western Seas, Oxx and Murtagh followed up with
an emphatic Stakes double with two more favourites, Aylesbury and
Hasainiya.
Key Change, adds-on with the SP office on the course in the continued
absence of bookmakers, failed by the minimum to overhaul the
front-running Clear Blue Water in Division One of the EBF Maiden but was
promoted after a stewards' inquiry.

FARMERS who regularly pull trailers behind pick-ups, 4x4 vehicles or
vans will be subject to a new set of regulations from July 1 next year.
In some cases, these may mean sitting additional driving tests.
The new rules are a result of the second EC Directive on the Driving
Licence and will affect all newly qualified drivers as well as some
existing ones.
From July 1, the weight limit for trailers will be 750kg for all
drivers who hold a category C or D entitlement only, in effect a licence
to drive a truck, but this can be got round by taking an extra test
upgrading the driving licence to C and E or D and E.
Currently most farm vehicles towing trailers are covered by a B and E
licence which is an ordinary car licence with an extra charge tagged on
covering the right to pull a trailer.
The principal change which will affect farmers is that from next July
a 17-year-old who has passed an ordinary driving test will not be
allowed to tow a trailer until he has passed another test to upgrade his
licence to B and E.
This test will be partly undertaken off public roads as with HGV tests
and the applicant will have to demonstrate an ability to reverse a
trailer and to manoeuvre in confined spaces.
There is, however, uncertainty as to whether that same 17-year-old
will be permitted to drive an agricultural tractor on the public highway
when pulling a trailer without sitting the same test.
On the topic of tachographs, the Department of Transport states that
the rules are quite clear and that the only valid exemptions are for
taking stock to a local market, which literally means the nearest
appropriate one, for a journey within a radius of 50km of the farm, or
if the combination of vehicle and trailer weighs under 3.5 tonnes when
laden.
Meanwhile, judgment is awaited in the case of a Stewartry farmer and
his use of an ATV on the public road. The sheriff in reserving judgment
said that the law needed clarification. Even the police say they have
some difficulty in interpreting all the laws covering farm vehicles.

Sara Villiers discovers how a finely balanced theatrical equation adds
up to more than the sum of its parts.
GRAPPLING with some of the finer points of chaos theory, the flaws in
the second law of thermo dynamics, the morality of literary criticism,
appreciation of poetic expression, trends in landscape gardening in
eighteenth century England, the contrasting inspirations behind
classical arts, the desire to anticipate the future, and the essential
inability to truly know the past might not sound like the easiest way to
spend an evening at the theatre but if you miss Tom Stoppard's Arcadia,
you do so at your peril.
While the concepts he explores might seem intimidating -- arts
audiences typically professing an ignorance of the sciences which they
seem to have no desire to improve -- he does so with such a flourish,
such flair, such lightness of touch that you are immediately absorbed
and excited by the intellectual investigations dramatised in the play.
But Arcadia also has a potent emotional charge: it is as moving as it
is enlightening. First produced by the National Theatre at the Lyttelton
Theatre in April 1993, it won instant acclaim throughout various cast
changes and a transfer to the West End. Directed by Trevor Nunn, a
long-term Stoppard collaborator, the production was judged Best Play of
the Year, sweeping up the Olivier, Evening Standard and Critics Choice
awards and three New York Tony nominations.
The National Theatre are now touring a production which opens at the
Kings Theatre in Glasgow tonight, and features Paul Shelley and Sharon
Maughan. It is directed by the young Gemma Bodinetz, previously
assistant director to Nunn who has been with the play from
pre-production.
Technically, Arcadia is a virtuoso drama, intertwining events from two
centuries which take place in Sidley, a large country house in
Derbyshire. In 1890 the tutor Septimus Hodge is instructing the
precocious 13-year-old Lady Thomasina Coverly in Latin and mathematics,
their lessons interrupted by the antics of some picaresque guests who
include a young, unseen Lord Byron.
We hear of carnal embrace in the gazebo, of challenges to duels and of
a monstrous plan by the landscape gardener Noakes to turn the grounds
into a wilderness which, with its addition of a hermitage (it was
fashionable in the eighteenth century to hire hermits to lend an air of
mystery), sounds like a Gothic theme park.
One hundred and eighty years later the garden historian Hannah Jarvis
(Maughan) and the academic Bernard Nightingale (Shelley) are sifting
through the house's documents attempting to discern the secrets of the
past. Bernard is determined that Byron was involved in a scandal there
which precipitated his flight from England. In the conversations between
Thomasina and Septimus and those between Hannah and Bernard, Stoppard
demonstrates dexterous word play and a sophisticated level of innuendo
which makes the spats playful between the tutor and his charge and
ascerbic between the contemporary writers.
Bodinetz emphasises that while Arcadia tackles the most challenging
mathematical concepts it is also, quite simply, a very funny play. ''It
is easy to talk about Stoppard as a man of ideas and forget that he can
be a real tart when it comes to humour. He can never resist going for a
punchline and he gets really upset when an actor resists a natural
punchline and plays against it and will tell them 'this isn't serving my
play'.''
With its complex structure Bodinetz has quite a task to ensure that
she adequately serves Stoppard's play, essentially an ingenious
detective story. ''The biggest challenge as director is in getting the
plot across, there are so many clues to pick up and the director has to
ensure that the audiences are making the connections and can realise
when Bernard is barking up the wrong tree. There is a lot of humour but
90% of it would fail if you haven't dotted every 'i' and crossed every
't'.''
The play certainly demands an intense, if rewarding, level of
engagement. ''People who watch Inspector Morse work quite hard at
working out what is going on, yet it is quite a novel experience to work
hard in the theatre,'' says Bodinetz.
''The joy is that if you don't want to work hard then the play can be
appreciated on other levels. There are so many doors and my job is to
make sure that the audience have all the keys but you don't have to go
through all the doors. On the simplest level you can enjoy the romance
between Septimus and Thomasina and the battle between Hannah and Bernard
although an audience of chaos physicists would find it a challenging
night at the theatre.''
Bodinetz, who worked at the Royal Court, has been irritated by the
inclination of some theatrical contemporaries to dismiss the play as
bourgeois theatre. ''We need theatre like this just as much as we need
Aids plays and dramas about life on a council estate in the north,'' she
states firmly.
''It does annoy me when more simplistic plays are held up as worthier.
We need plays which stretch the frontiers of people's imaginations which
challenge and which pursue truth and human endeavour. There's a lot of
talk about the way forward in theatre being through spectacle but I know
that a lot of people don't come to the theatre because they don't find
it intellectually stimulating. I think it's sad that we have become a
society which is ashamed of intellectual efficiency and of being
articulate.''
Stoppard's articulacy and firm graft of theatrics makes Arcadia one of
the most thrilling, energetic plays you are likely to see. Descend on
the theatre in droves, you might not be in Arcadia but you will
certainly be transported to the dramatic equivalent of seventh heaven.
Arcadia, Kings Theatre Glasgow, tonight until November 4, Festival
Theatre, Edinburgh, November 7-11.

SHEEP and goats have been shown by Scottish researchers to have taste
buds refined enough to rank them alongside the world's top gourmets and
chefs.
Scientists at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute in Aberdeen
gave ewes and goats a choice of feeds. One, used as a control, was
unflavoured. Others contained flavours including apple, caramel, garlic,
maple, onion, orange, strawberry and truffle.
The sheep recorded a definite preference for the truffle-flavoured
variety. Second favourite was garlic and third was onion. Goats had
similar preferences although, with them, onion scored higher than
garlic.
As a result, feed manufacturer Bibby has introduced the truffle
flavour to all its Primelock ewe feeds.
Other trials have shown that lambs prefer sweet or milky flavours so
caramel and vanilla are being added to their feeds.

MY companion wore a sweaty and beatific expression. ''This reminds me
of The Old Grey Whistle Test!'' he whooped, hopping energetically on one
leg. He was right. And he was wrong.
In its dedication to the employment of musicianly values, Sunday
night's show certainly resembled the much-derided BBC2 TV rock prog from
the far-off seventies. But unlike The Mouldy Greybeards' Woozle Test a
Nils Lofgren gig is a thing of enduring pleasure.
Eighteen years on from his appearance with Tom Petty at Glasgow's
long-gone Apollo, Nils Lofgren still looks like Keith Richard's younger
brother. That vulpine grin; those rock-gipsy bandanas, shades,
neckerchiefs and armbands. And Nils still enjoys cranking out a guitar
solo. He gave us Chuck Berry chooglers; bluff bluesy peals, and delicate
ones that were like dust-motes in sunlight.
But they were all delivered free of indulgence, intended solely to
advance Nils' songs, gritty constructions which Nils sings in affecting
tones, like a less quavery Willie Nelson or a more muscular Neil Young.
Nils' older songs, Shine Silently and Cry Tough to name but two,
throbbed with life. Ditto his newer ones, from the current Damaged Goods
album. Old and grey? No way.
Yup, Nils Lofgren restored my faith in the undying lure of the olde
electricke gewtar. He also restored my faith in the joy of rock; the
primacy of roll; the excitement of rhythm, and the glory of blues. Final
result? Nils' brand of rock'n'roll 10, other non-Nils musics nil.

THE thought did cross my mind that pantos -- like the forests of
plastic Christmas trees already in department stores -- had come
somewhat early upon us. Snow White, after all, is not one of the
tradtional Kathakali stories . . . but Snow White (adapted and retitled
Oppression of the Innocent) was what we got -- and rather splendid it
was too.
In Kathakali tradition, the story pivots on three classic characters:
heroic, evil, and innocent. Which translates rather neatly, into the
Prince, The Wicked Queen, and Snow White -- all performed by men, with
the Queen in a costume that would have many a Dame beating false bosoms
in envy.
Still, none of us needed to be told that we were in the presence of
greatness when Kalamandalam Gopi appeared as the Prince. Hands and eyes
are the essential communicators in this Indian form of story-telling.
Gopi uses both with an illuminating artistry that really does transcend
language. From amid the heavily decorated finery of the character, he
signalled recognisably human emotions and reactions -- the merest quiver
of an eyebrow, the dejected droop of a hand spoke chapter and verse of
grief.
Kalamandalam Vijayakumar -- doubling as Snow White and the disguised
queen -- offered two opposing faces of womankind with a perception that
was utterly persuasive, utterly exquisite in its finesse. The Kathakali
Snow White proved the strength of classic story-telling are universal.
The company are in Brodick tonight  and tomorrow, in Irvine on Thursday
and Friday.

AS a regular ferry user and seafarer, may I come to the support of Ian
Winkle and the Glasgow Concept of RoRo ferry safety (October 27).
Anyone who has tried to carry an over-full soup plate from stove to
table has had a demonstration of what happens on a flooded car deck.
The first priority in damage control at sea is to limit free surface
flooding simply because of the danger posed by uncontrolled water
surging about.
Using perforated car decks combined with tanks or ducting means that
free surface flooding is quickly converted into controlled water
movement using nothing more than gravity. Once contained, flood water is
less of a threat to stability and can be eliminated by pumping.
By contrast, the dwarf movable bulkheads favoured by ferry operators
and IMO subdivide but do not eliminate free surface water. Also they are
operated mechanically. Anything mechanical will fail sooner or later and
usually at the worst possible moment.
Moreover, the need to marshal vehicles and erect the bulkheads prior
to sailing imposes costly time and space penalties on the carrier.
Even without side buoyancy, a perforated deck system could be
installed in currently operating vessels during normal refit and by
itself would be a considerable contribution to increased safety.

ALASDAIR Gray is not a disagreeable man, but he does like to disagree.
The man is a natural dissident. He is the sort of figure who, had he
been living there, would have helped give the word ''intellectual'' the
positive image it retained in Eastern Europe.
Try to pigeonhole Gray and he will inevitably wriggle free. Confront
him with an debating topic derived from three sentences from Lanark,
still probably his best known novel, and he will question the precepts
behind it.
Gray has still not been to see Alasdair Cording's adaptation of his
work for TAG Theatre Company, which opens at the Citizens' tomorrow
following runs at the Edinburgh Festival and Stirling's MacRobert Art
Centre, and does not intend to do so until the last night.
Coinciding with the Citizens' run, the next Herald/Tramway discussion
-- on November 9 -- is a forum organised by TAG on the relationship
between Glasgow and its culture. It takes its cue from a line in Lanark
used in the play: ''Glasgow exists only as a music-hall song and a few
bad novels. That's all we've given to the outside world. It's all we've
given ourselves.''
Does Gray still believe that? Why should he? Why should he answer the
question?
''Cities are always changing into other kinds of cities. In 200 years
the world will be as different from 1960 as the present is from 1750. It
won't be a world where people hail flying taxis to skyscraper offices.
Leaving aside ecological disaster . . .''
At this point Gray's vision of the future tailed off. He gazed briefly
into the middle distance but his science fiction was not to be shared.
''Sorry . . . what was all that about?'' he pondered.
Fortunately you can read some of Gray's thoughts on the shape of the
future in his new paperback The History Maker (Penguin). Acquiring that
will be easier than buying Lanark -- as The Herald revealed yesterday --
Pan/Picador having failed to provide copies of Gray's revision of the
novel for Glasgow bookshops anxious to cash in on the TAG show.
A vexed relationship with a publisher is not new to Gray. He fell out
with one because his own artwork for The Fall of Kelvin Walker was
replaced. He was well annoyed with Penguin when they made his editor
redundant. He is now with Bloomsbury, who will shortly publish his
novella Mavis Belfrage.
Gray's state of being ''a wee bit annoyed'' is a characteristic place
for him to be. He remembers and records injustices and destructions that
have been inflicted on his work, but is unsurprised by them.
The church mural-painting in Lanark is derived from his own
experience, but his work at Greenhead Church of Scotland at Bridgeton
Cross went the way of the kirk -- ''demolished to make room for an
expansion of London Road that never happened''. The Leonardo Da Vinci
epigraph to Lanark was previously to be found on a mural he did at the
visitors centre of Palacerigg nature reserve near Cumbernauld, but a
later warden had its warning against human irresponsibility replaced
with something ''cheerier''. The worshippers at Belleisle Street
Synagogue were reportedly a little perturbed by the turbulent silver and
black clouds he painted on their roof. He thinks they may have expected
''Larry the Lamb clouds on China Blue.''
Artwork dominates his study in Glasgow with the latest
work-in-progress on a substantial old easel, although curiously an empty
frame is prominent in the middle of the longest wall. Opposite two
copies of the Declaration of Arbroath are hung either side of the
fireplace -- one facsimile, one the text. But Gray is not about to be
defined by his nationality.
''I take my Scottishness for granted. It is part of the Scottish
inferiority complex that Scots wonder how Scottish they are.
''The thing that is interesting about Scotland is the huge diversity
of it. Glasgow was at its most productive because of its connections
with farming in the south, mining in the east, and the Highlands to the
north. But I wouldn't like to see Glasgow made capital -- because
Edinburgh's bloody close despite of our differences.''
From nationalism to inter-city rivalry, the sequence of Gray-thought
is clear but disarmingly swift. A suggestion that until Sue Glover's
Bondagers Scottish drama had been very concerned with a misty-eyed
vision of the industrial past brings a response with a longer
perspective, rather than a direct reply.
''Until very recently indeed it was the rural tradition that was best
expressed, in the poetry of Burns, the novels of Sir Walter Scott and
even John Galt, although he had more social range. In fact The Entail is
a great Glasgow novel about the emergence of the mercantile city when
that class was acquiring land to turn themselves into gentry.''
They wouldn't say it, but TAG were probably slightly relieved that
Gray has maintained an arm's length attitude to their Lanark. In fact he
prepared a film script from the novel the best part of ten years ago for
the same team who have now secured lottery funding towards a movie of
his Poor Things.
''I would have done Lanark for TAG if I hadn't had other things to do.
I liked Alasdair Cording's work. 'He won't botch it up,' I thought.''
You would hesitate to taint him with caution, but Gray is conscious
that it is sometimes wise for him to take a back seat.
''If I'd been involved a little, I would have wanted to be involved a
lot. This was probably better for the sanity of everyone.''
* Lanark opens at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, tomorrow.

MARK FISHER reveals the secret behind director Richard Baron's
unprecedented successful run of work in Scottish repertory houses
RICHARD Baron has quietly being doing something no other Scottish
theatre director has done for a long time. Without setting up his own
company, without scouting for work in England, he has made it seem
possible for a freelance director to sustain a prolonged period of work
in mainstream repertory houses in Scotland.
Ever since he took his first job as a Scottish Arts Council trainee
director at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum in 1991, Baron has enjoyed an
unprecedented run of uninterrupted work. Since those first fully-fledged
Lyceum productions -- Tom Stoppard's Travesties, Tom McGrath's Laurel
and Hardy, Arthur Miller's The Price and Ben Travers' Rookery Nook --
he's fashioned his own little circuit, and the job offers are showing no
sign of drying up.
Unlike just about every other director of his generation, he has never
had to fall back on profit-share touring or drama college directing to
keep himself busy.
It's a shame that this should be a particularly remarkable
achievement, but it is true to say that even the most promising young
Scottish directors rarely get to put on more than two or three
productions a year. And the fact that he has done it with a considerable
amount of popular and critical success is all the more remarkable.
I caught a glimpse of how he might have found such a comfortable niche
when I met him in Dundee Rep's bar during a break from the technical
rehearsal for the Scottish premiere of Les Liaisons Dangereuses which,
just to be different, they're calling Dangerous Liaisons.
That he is supremely unfrazzled, despite having just delayed the first
dress rehearsal, is impressive enough. But it is when our interview
starts and I realise he's asking me all the questions that I spot
Baron's real secret. He's a team man, he gets on, he fits in, he
listens. He's not a power-hungry dictator out to impose his ideas on an
impressionable audience with a bunch of malleable actors, but a
sensitive operator keen to serve the best interests of the play and to
draw out the best from his actors.
''I enjoy working with actors very much,'' he says, once I've turned
the conversation back to him. ''I enjoy the team feel of it. I've never
had a production when I haven't enjoyed it, nor would I say that the
company hadn't enjoyed it. A lot of people chuck ideas in and I like
that -- and I like the fact that it's ultimately my decision.''
He's also the business-like professional who can be relied on to pull
a production together efficiently and on time.
'' The thing I found most difficult was when I went from a musical
straight into a Stoppard, straight into a Shakespeare, straight into a
panto, straight into The Importance of Being Earnest without a break.
You found yourself really chasing your own tail. I like doing quite a
lot of research and preparation and I found myself cutting corners to
get through the volume of work.''
He's well aware, though, that it's an enviable position to be in, even
if it does come about through the age-old inability of the freelance to
turn down work.
It's also unlikely that were he in any other position he would get the
chance to direct one of the first post-RSC productions of Christopher
Hampton's seductive tale of pre-revolutionary decadence among the French
aristocracy. With Briony McRoberts and Graham McTavish heading the cast,
Dangerous Liaisons is at once a period costume drama and a complex tale
of deceit and intrigue.
''It's a fascinating play to do because of the detail you have to work
into tiny little moments, and the rigour of the arguments.
''I treat each thing on its merits. I try and do enough work around it
to know what sort of thing it should be and then try and be truthful. I
wouldn't want there to be a particular style.''
* Dangerous Liaisons opens tonight at Dundee Rep Theatre and runs
until November 18.

J P K GARTHWAITE falls into the trap of commenting on a subject based
on information gleaned from media reports (October 25).
The Glasgow Development Agency operates to an economic development
remit, not a social one. GDA therefore could not fund the work of the
Gay and Lesbian Centre referred to, or any other such project.
GDA's contribution to the Dixon Street project was made on strict
economic development criteria, applying the kind of scrutiny used in the
evaluation of any application for financial assitance towards a
development with potential economic benefit for the city.
The financial assistance to the Dixon Street property project was made
on the basis that it would remove an area of dereliction from the
cityscape and bring derelict property back into economic use for letting
on the open market and create jobs.
The nature of the centre, which is the landlord of the premises, was
not a factor in the decision to contribute towards the project. The GDA
has never had any indication of exclusive use of the property by any
group.

SUMMER is over and still there are no bylaws in force to make Loch
Lomond safer and more attractive to the visiting public and lochside
residents.
The blame for this must lie squarely on the shoulders of the Scottish
Sports Council which after 18 months of consultation, lodged a
last-minute list of objections with the Scottish Office which has to
take notice of this official advisory body.
The Scottish Sports Council is charged with caring for the interests
of the public at large, not just the selfish interests of one sport such
as water-skiing.
Furthermore, it's nonsense for the Scottish Sports Council to suggest
that it had not been consulted about the by-law proposals as I
understand that during the consultation period it submitted a five-page
response to the Loch Lomond Park Authority.
It is also significant that over the last few years safety on Loch
Lomond -- and the proposal to introduce by-laws -- has been given a high
profile in the mass media and 65 bodies, including the sports council,
were consulted.
Since the sports council in its initial response expressed no serious
concerns for the interests of water skiers one can only presume that it
has since been lobbied by water-skiing interests to the detriment of all
other water users, vistors, and lochside residents.
It is shameful that the interests of many -- including the hundreds of
thousands of tourists who visit Loch Lomond annually -- should be
brushed aside for the sole benefit of a single minority interest.
Water skiers and jet skiers create noise and disturbance and when
driven irresponsibly are a source of considerable danger. While such
irresponsible behaviour may be limited to a minority of those
participating in these activities, this is no justification for
extending the already generous allowances which have been made under the
by-law proposals.
We would like to see the local water ski clubs and associations speak
out publicly -- as has the Yachting Association -- of their awareness of
the need for the proposed by-laws in the interests of safety.
It is tragic that during the delay in introducing the by-laws caused
by the Scottish Sports Council's belated objections a tragic and
potentially avoidable death has occurred on Loch Lomond.
Had the by-laws been in place -- and observed -- the accident would in
all probability have been avoided. We hope that the Scottish Sports
Council is examining its conscience in the light of this tragedy.

President, Friends of Loch Lomond,

I READ with keen interest the letter from Dr Terry Isles of the John
Muir Trust and the comparisons he drew between John Muir's environmental
philosophies in the USA and the enormous influence on land management in
this country of the late Frank Fraser Darling, world-renowned human
ecologist (October 25).
Dr Isles properly points out that the style of land management carried
out by the John Muir Trust on its properties in the Highlands and
Islands owes as much to Fraser Darling as it does to Muir. This is
particularly characterised by the major involvement of local communities
in management and the trust's genuine and practical concern for the
social and economic wellbeing of those communities.
There is, however, another close comparison which should have been
made: both John Muir and Fraser Darling were passionately committed to
the establishment of national parks. In the case of Fraser Darling he
remained passionately committed to the introduction of Scottish National
Parks to the end of his life.
He castigated Government in the post-war period for its ''sardonic
decision to establish no national parks in Scotland. The
shortsightedness and wrongheadedness of that decision becomes the more
apparent as the recreational function of wild lands is realised as an
urgent and proper form of land use''.
National parks, designed to meet international criteria, still offer
the most effective planning, protection and management for areas such as
Loch Lomond and the Cairngorms and, perhaps more importantly for local
communities, national parks offer the most democratic and
locally-accountable approach to management.
Tourism, recreation, sustainable economic development, and traditional
land uses all have a role in national parks.
It was, I thought, significant that one local planning authority in
the Cairngorms area, in its response to the Cairngorm Working Party
proposals for a Natural Heritage Area based on the voluntary principle,
favoured a national park instead, not only because this was seen as the
most practical solution to the serious problems facing that area but
because a national park was seen as more democratically-based.
I am certain that this view would have had the firm support of Frank
Fraser Darling, had that great and good man still been with us to offer
his wisdom. What John Muir's view would have been -- from a
nineteenth-century US national park perspective -- we shall never know.

JACK McLean said I did not come up with a solution to the problems
caused by violent and anti-social juvenile delinquents (October 27). He
also ended with the words ''It is all very well greeting about scumbags.
You should be greeting for the decent kids on the block who you aren't
thinking about at all''.
It happens that people who are most affected by the activities of the
yobbish element in society are their near neighbours, that is, the
decent people who live in the same locality. Many of these people are my
close friends, and their quality of life is important to me.
It would be very easy to follow Jack McLean's example and express my
personal indignation and repugnance at the kind of loutish behaviour
which prompted this correspondence, but, although indignation is
justified and much more healthy than indifference, it does not solve
problems.
There is no single or easy answer to the problem of the fragmentation
of our society, but increased juvenile delinquency is only one aspect of
a much wider malaise. I adhere to my previously stated opinion that the
key must lie in education rather than in suppression and I use the word
education in its widest sense.
Most of the problem pupils have been subjected to the same kind of
conditioning during and after their school years. As long as the real
nature of the problem is not recognised, the schools will be unable to
counter these negative environmental influences.
I will give just one example of a social influence which breeds
cynicism and alienation amoung young people. In our society, the
available labour force far exceeds the number of jobs which the economy
can provide, and the majority of our citizens, as well as our
politicians and columnists, simply cannot come to terms with that stark
reality.
Jack McLean defines ''degenerate'' as descending to being without
usefulness. That is the message which the underclass continually hears
from the rest of society and many of them respond by living down to that
description.
We live in an increasingly interdependent society within an
increasingly interdependent world where problems must be solved by the
application of reason. Self-indulgent emotional outbursts do not help.

I TAKE great exception to Hugh Barnes's pseudo-academic attack on Jane
Austen (October 21).
I can only imagine that the reason he has chosen to tarnish the
reputation of one of our greatest novelists by supporting the theory of
a lesbian relationship with her sister, Cassandra is to pad out a thin,
poorly researched rambling article showing his own dislike of women in
general and his inability to appreciate greatness when he sees it.
His prurient and ill-judged two-pronged attack on Jane Austen's
private life and on Andrew Davies's subtle and excellent adaptation of
Pride and Prejudice makes poor reading.
Screenwriter Davies has kept to the original text most faithfully. The
casting, period settings, costumes, and choreography are all absolutely
superb. I am sure that the author would approve.
If Hugh Barnes were to go back to the original text he would see that
Jane Austen did not dislike men; indeed she liked them very much.
Incidentally, on TV Elizabeth and Darcy kissed outside her parents'
home at Longbourn. The village street is in Meryton. Netherfield is the
estate rented by Mr Bingley. It''s nice to get one's facts right when
attempting to be erudite.

WE have had some excellent insights into certain periods of the first
50 years of the Citizens' Theatre in Gorbals. Rather surprisingly,
however, no attempt seems to have been made to commission an overall
picture of the half century: as a result, quite a number of key names
have slipped through the net.
I have noticed no reference, for instance, to Callum Mill, one of the
truly great artistic directors -- and a Scot too! No-one who saw them
could forget his dazzling trio in 1961 of Murder in the Cathedral, Under
Milk Wood, and A Passage to India.
Also a superb actor, he was one of the best Willy Lomans that I've
ever seen.

HOTFOOT from a desultory, self-indulgent performance A Little Shadow
in a freezing Street Level gallery by photographer Allen Frame (why do
Americans always assume that you are interested in their family history,
home movies, and holiday snaps?), what a cheering, warming experience
this turned out to be. If an illustration is required of the diversity
of gay and lesbian culture, this was it. Variety is, indeed, not dead.
Two years ago the first Glasgay! cabaret fell foul of the dangers of
such gala events -- too much crammed in, everything over-running. This
year's event was at once more controlled and more relaxed -- and more
involving and inclusive, no matter what your sexuality.
As compere of the first half, Sandy Toksvig was a delight, making
hilarious capital out of serious and apposite material: her ''outing''
by the tabloid press, and her more recent experience of the room
allocation policy of Glasgow Hilton Hotel (shame on it). Closing the
show, Dorothy Paul generated her own familiar brand of warmth and had
gags that were a match for the pithy observations of Toksvig.
Musical contribution of the night came from oor ain Lorna Brooks,
whose sister Hilary was accompanist to all, memorably on Paul's Cry Me A
River.
But let's hear it for the guys too: whether in frocks (Regina Fong and
Chloe Poems), leather breeks (Michael Cashman), suit (Simon Fanshawe) or
sports jacket and flannels (Edwin Morgan).

I THINK you misunderstand the difference between history and drama
(Milking mythology, October 23). Both are concerned with truth; the
former with the particular truth of past events, the latter with the
general truth of the human condition.
No-one is claiming that Rob Roy or Robin Hood are historically
accurate; they are vehicles for stories of noble and moral spirits. It
is Braveheart's claim to both truths which is the problem and each
diminishes the other.

A COUPLE of years ago, Richard Eyre's Macbeth at the National was
marked by its circle of jet-spewing flames -- a potent reminder of the
supernatural in this most superstitious of plays.
Small scale theatre can't usually match its heavily subsidised
brethren for resources and scale but Nick Kent's smartly efficient
production for the Tricycle in north London certainly comes close. Using
the RSC's pyrotechnic expert, Wayne Dowdeswell, fire is his production's
defining element.
The conclusion is engulfed by a blaze, and flame also licks along the
floor at the start, spurts up and down walls and round the witches'
bubbling cauldrons.
In a play of dark, shadow-riddled nightmares and cycles of
blood-letting, flame becomes both a symbol of nemesis and conveyor of a
tremendous sense of urgency. At just under two hours, Kent's is a zippy
production keeping to fairly conventional lines but boasting a black
Macbeth in Lennie James and an integrated, racially mixed cast that
should put larger companies to shame.
The play remains a strictly personal -- and persuasive -- account of
one man's descent into tyranny with James's slight, pleasant-faced
Macbeth patently a weak man egged on by Helen McCrory's outstanding,
thoughtful, briskly determined Lady Macbeth whose taunts to his manhood
are clearly the decisive spur.

HOW often are we informed of there being insufficient times for
Members' Private Bills reaching the Statute Book? Frequently -- and the
reason, of course, is the length of MPs' vacations.
Also, our political masters insist that increased pay can only be
awarded for increased productivity.
What utter gall, then, on the part of Sir Terence Higgins, MP for
Worthing, to suggest MPs' salaries should be doubled, presumably for a
continuance of the existing hours of Parliament.
A counter-suggestion is surely either for their setting an example for
productivity or, better still, halving their number as was suggested
recently by one of their number.

* THE Paul Taylor Dance Company brings its Greatest Hits show to
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre this week, the only British stopover on a
world tour. Taylor is a dancemaker of inveterate curiosity who doesn't
break rules, he just doesn't bother with them. His work is stunning to
watch and yet, as the touring programmes show, Taylor's work also offers
food for thought -- especially a kind of humour that occupies the
shifting sands between tragedy and comedy.The Paul Taylor Dance Company
can be seen at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre with Programme One
tomorrow and Thursday and Programme Two on Friday and Saturday.

FOR well over a year now, a large sign above aisle 12 of a well-known
supermarket has proclaimed ''Femenine Hygiene''. On querying this
linguistic lapse, customers were told, ''Yes, we do know about it, but
it would cost too much to change the sign''.
Not very good for the corporate image, I would have thought. At last
someone in authority obviously agreed that the offending word has one
''e'' too many -- so now above aisle 12 we see ''Femenin Hygiene''.
Other orthographic atrocities, past and present, perpetrated by the
same store include ''Ladies' Body's #9.99'' (at least they got it half
right), ''Benedicts mints'', and, just in time for Halloween,
''pumkins''.
Are these signs produced locally, or are the errors replicated all
over the country? Either way, is it any wonder youngsters see no point
in learning to spell correctly when they are set such an example by
those who should know better?

BRITAIN and France have been close allies all this century but it has
been a prickly relationship all the same, as if the previous two
centuries of rivalry persisted through changed times. That pattern may
be altering, and the evident rapport between Mr Major and Mr Chirac will
be one factor in the process. The two countries certainly have plenty in
common and, if Tory Euro-scepticism would formerly have distanced them
quickly from the French, the experience of the French referendum on
Maastricht, with its tiny ''oui'' majority, showed how popular French
perceptions had changed. How far that change has gone remains to be seen
when the French are still maintaining the franc fort policy which ties
them closely to the D-Mark, if at enormous cost. The change of emphasis
in Franco-British relations must mirror some French doubts about the
immediate future of the EU, and how far France can be expected to meet
the challenges posed. French support for the EU has not obviously
weakened but the way in which Mr Chirac thinks about Nato and the United
States does mark a switch in French foreign policy: under Mr Mitterrand
it was widely feared that France wanted to reduce links with America and
even phase out Nato. Such fears may have been exaggerated but are now
clearly invalidated, which will be a relief to the British Government.
The change in stance has not appeared suddenly for it was surely
advertised by the way in which Downing Street has steadfastly refused to
condemn the French nuclear tests in Polynesia, although that refusal
marked a definite break with the Antipodean Commonwealth. And it has
come at a time when the probable expansion of the European Union to
central and eastern nations seems bound to precipitate a reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy from which France will anyhow cease to be
such a major beneficiary. A reform would certainly suit the UK since,
quite apart from its irrationalities, the CAP has been a major cost to
this country.
Both in the Gulf and in Bosnia the new and developing Franco-British
understanding has been evident but there have been some tensions as
well, and a definite difference did emerge over Rwanda. And there were
also earlier differences about attitudes to Israel and the outcome of
the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. There will not be any complete
identity of interest but if joint ventures, like the proposed air group,
do materialise the areas of co-operation seem bound to widen steadily,
though the British Government's opinion, at least as articulated by Mr
Portillo in his ill-considered speech at the Tory party conference,
remains hostile to commitments which would hand over command of any
British forces to our allies. What is being seen now is tentative rather
than firm, as if the two sides were moving closer, but only gingerly.
One area where joint involvement would be beneficial is Africa south
of the Sahara. British and French policies towards their African
colonies differed markedly, but the experience of independence has been
much the same in most African states, tending to impoverish and
destablise them whatever their earlier European connections. The
countries involved need help to enjoy continued access to the EU market,
but they also need a sympathetic response to their large debts and the
strain repayments impose on their treasuries and modest holdings of hard
currencies. Although Franco-British co-operation elsewhere is greatly to
be welcomed, there is probably no part of the globe in which it could do
more good more quickly than in Africa south of the Sahara.

Theatre
NO-ONE has done more for the lesbian and gay cause in Scottish theatre
in recent years than Clyde Unity's John Binnie. While camp influences
are everywhere on the stage, Binnie's realism about youthful sexual
awakening has -- less ostentatiously -- been educating and changing
attitudes through community tour after community tour. It is fitting
that his work has a suitable platform at Glasgay! with his own company's
revival of A Little Older coming into The Tron tonight and Strathclyde
Theatre Group tackling another of his plays.
In trying to distance themselves from the warm, enveloping house style
of Clyde Unity, the young cast have gone for an anti-naturalistic
approach in staging and performance. A good idea which should,
paradoxically, throw the focus on to the text, it comes adrift in both
initial execution and eventual dissipation. To begin with this
sprint-through-Binnie is too fast and leaves many of the lines lost. The
writing itself goes from pathos to hilarity and back again in as many
lines, but that's Binnie's style. Speed it up and the roller-coaster
ride is too unbelievable.
Later, the pace lessened and the weaknesses of the performances were
more obvious. Kim Hardie, as the predatory American lesbian Erin, has
the toughest job since her part is seriously underwritten, but both
Catherine Keating (Basher) and Tricia Mullin (Maxy) have problems in
projecting the deeper emotions of their characters behind the gallus
streetwise front.
Binnie's morality is the core of his writing and is not half as
simplistic as it sometimes seems. It takes a particular understanding to
pull off and, frankly, it is overdue that other companies have a go.

IT'S 30 years since Joan Baez left the intimacy of New York's coffee
bars for the world's concert stages and yet sometimes, listening to her
with her snug-fitting three-piece band, it seems like she never left
them at all, such is her talent for shrinking venues.
That intimacy doesn't always work in Baez's favour. Her voice, the
voice virtually every female folk singer of the sixties would have died
for, has retained its quality as well as adding a layer or two of
character. Yet in a sequence of old favourites, including Sweet Sir
Galahad and Ain't Goin' Nowhere (not the Dylan song she thought we were
expecting), it sounded weary. Later, Don't Think Twice It's All Right
(the Dylan song we were expecting) had a decidedly ''here we go again''
air about it.
It was when Baez took on new songs, or at least songs new to her, that
the magic began to work. Eric Bogle's paeon to the Anzac troops'
contribution to the First World War, And the Band Played Waltzing
Matilda, brought out a strength and dignity that was more than just
protest singing, particularly -- curiously enough -- during the simple
Waltzing Matilda refrain at the end. And Tim Hardin's Don't Make
Promises You Can't Keep, given an easy, punchy arrangement, was the
stuff that keeps reputations deservedly alive.
Lighter moments such as Why Do Fools Fall In Love?, sung a capella,
doowop style, were equally successful, although it was a pity she had to
follow this and a vintage solo spot by continuing her insistence that
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down is a singalong number.

FEELING fit as a fiddle, we dropped into The Herald Foundation Clinic
for Women last Friday to attend its official opening by Baroness Smith
of Gilmorehill. Such chirpiness was perhaps surprising for if fear has a
home it must surely be inside a hospital. Yet here we were at 10 in the
morning, neither out-patients nor stretcher cases, entering Glasgow's
Royal Infirmary by the main door.
The reason for high spirits was something innovative and hopeful. Our
clinic, a medical suite for gynaecological, menstrual and related
disorders -- and funded by readers' donations -- is the first of its
kind in Scotland and seems set to be an influential prototype. Within
cheering surroundings it provides patients with an advanced treatment
facility tailored to their needs rather than those of hospital
bureaucracy.
As a result, all procedures and care are managed within the briefest
possible time-scale. Thus, the usual tiresome and tense palaver of
calling women back repeatedly to different venues, and often different
doctors, is avoided.
Consultant-led and operating only on GP referral, the clinic's actual
design is integral to its holistic approach. We are now more than
halfway towards the target sum of #100,000. With the decor complete and
its most sophisticated and versatile equipment installed, the suite
combines the best visual features of a private clinic with that level of
specialist expertise which only the NHS can muster.
Needless to say the mission to get this far has been daunting. Our
location was ear-marked as a corner of the Royal which was once a
Victorian operating theatre and has latterly acted, with only the most
rudimentary furnishings, as the site for colposcopy and other associated
clinics.
Gynaecology is the most sensitive area of medicine for women, and raw
surroundings only intensify patient vulnerability and alarm.
Apart from the best in technology, the flair of an artist was
required. As it happens we have ended up with the flair of more than 20
artists, but from the start it was Drew Plunkett, head of interior
design at Glasgow School of Art, who embarked on creating an island of
tranquility, using interesting pastels, carpets, and furniture to evoke
the ambience of a smart hotel. In fact, the beneficial effects of his
scheme can already been seen in patients' more confident demeanour, and
if nothing else, this has made for better blood-pressure readings.
ART, particularly if it tends towards soothing colours and the
figurative, has long been known to alleviate stress in highly controlled
workplaces, and increasingly medical research confirms that humanising
hospitals with paintings, plants, and attractive design can actually
help speedy recovery.
So, thanks to the endeavours of Clare Henry, The Herald's art critic,
the clinic's walls are decked with pictures loaned by some of Scotland's
notable artists -- Elizabeth Blackadder, Jacki Parry, Claire Harrigan,
and Elizabeth Lamb among them.
Of course, such assets bring their own problems. In times of budget
management no public hospital can readily plunge into its pocket for art
insurance. In this respect we were fortunate to gain the services of
Blackwall Green, fine art insurance brokers at Lloyd's since 1846, whose
more substantial clients include the National Gallery in London and the
Tate.
To cure when it can, to relieve suffering often, to comfort always . .
. medicine's oldest adage stands strong as ever for our clinic today. In
time we hope to arrange public evenings when readers may visit the
location under the stewardship of Dr Helen McEwan, its pioneer.
In the meantime we must keep rattling the begging bowl. When women
fall ill, the small world of the family often collapses because in the
tumult of emotions, children and partners are unprepared for
self-reliance. Behind almost every donation have been stories of
gratitude for health restored, stories, too, of tender, private
remembrance.
For the luckiest of reasons, most women may never have cause to be
treated at the clinic, but everyone who has supported its creation in
whatever way can be assured that its blend of medical excellence and
stylish, convivial reassurance is already a healing testament to
something special in that carpeted corner of the Royal's fifth floor.
* Donations may be sent to The Herald Foundation for Women's Health,
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP.

ONE of the pleasures of living on Harris is, now and again, to visit
the adjacent island of Scalpay. The eastern extremity of Scalpay, Eilean
Glas, sprouts one of the oldest lighthouses on the Scottish coast, and
from here -- on a fine day -- one may enjoy magnificent seascapes, for
the light is clear to much of the western seaboard.
Many, in summer time, land on Scalpay, and head for its outer points
-- Kennavay, Outend, Eilean Glas -- to stare at all these hills and
ranges and islands, spread grandly about the Hebridean sea. And then
there are the people of Scalpay themselves: indomitable, incorrigible,
sometimes impossible, but a kind and sturdy race.
Just the other week, though, a more spectacular visitor came. She
stayed longer than expected, and seems set to stay for years to come,
and the Scalpaich look upon her with mingled mirth, compassion, and
horror.
On the first day, a Friday, at two in the morning, the 2000 tonne Golf
Star, laden with granite, grounded on a reef by Stilamair. She was
sailing from Ireland to Germany (well, who would deliver a load of rock
to Harris?), was registered in the Caribbean, and her master was the
only fellow on board with more than two words of English.
Now, the Scalpaich are good folk. The Golf Star was not long stuck
when kindly fishermen raised her on the VHF and offered to tow her off.
Two or three of their brave prawnboats would have sufficed. The offer
was refused. Perhaps it was the master, and perhaps it was the owner,
and perhaps it was their insurer, but the Golf Star indignantly resisted
any notion of assistance.
Several hours passed before the ship, quite unable to free herself,
finally contacted the coastguard in Stornoway. But Friday was a fine
day. The crew remained on board as the Scalpaich drove their BMWs and
Volvos and other nice cars to Outend, and ogled.
It was the second day, the Saturday, and only when the weather grew
distinctly nasty -- strong south-westerly gales on the forecast -- did
the men of the Golf Star begin to fear. It was too wild now for any boat
to approach, so a helicopter came and lifted all her crew off. One
needed hospital treatment for slight injuries.
The third day was the Sabbath, and nothing ever happens on the Sabbath
except weather.
On the fourth day, Monday, a tug puffed up from Lowestoft. Remarkably,
there is no tug stationed in the Minch in summertime, and our winter
boat is not yet in place. So a day or two was lost, waiting for this
white knight, Anglian Earl. And now, of course, Councillor Rentaquote
and Miss Busybody and Mr Loadsa Public-Money, MP, were demanding a full
public inquiry and saying whatever would have happened if this had been
the superquarry and just think if she had been a very large crude
carrier and what about the fuel oil and what about the workers, etc,
etc?
Providence smiled, and the wind blew. Monday was a very nasty day. The
rain poured from leaden skies and riddled a groaning sea. And the
billows, larger, meaner, pounded on the abandoned Golf Star. The Anglian
Earl was helpless. She stood at Scalpay and monitored the situation. She
puffed into Tarbert and monitored the situation. Now and again she
chugged out by the reef and the Golf Star and monitored the situation.
But there was no approaching the stranded vessel.
The hull now holed, and a forward tank burst, and marine diesel and
marine oil poured into the sea.
On the fifth day, Tuesday, the Golf Star was still there and the poor
Anglia Earl had done puff-all. The talk was now of pollution. Soothing
voices insisted that the wild bad weather would rapidly disperse the
stuff. But this did little to assure the salmon farmers and all here
whose livelihood depends on the pure clean sea.
The wind grew. As the fifth day merged into the sixth day we were hit
by a full-blown gale. It churned the Minch into so much whipped cream
and rattled slates and sent every ship for harbour and the dog cried so
piteously I had at length to rise and take her to bed with me. And the
Golf Star, alone, helpless, bore the full brunt of the elements.
On the sixth day I decided to head for Scalpay and see the poor thing.
So I sorted the camera, and gathered the dog, and we drove the winding
miles of switchback road to the Scalpay ferry. Across, I found myself
part of the latest convoy of cars heading for the wake at Outend. I also
found that, calm as it now was in Tarbert, it was a very, very wild day
on Scalpay. She lies out of the lee of the big Harris hills; and a
strong southerly blew and blew.
At Outend we parked hugger-mugger. There was the Golf Star still in
one piece, aslant the big reef, her bows high, her stern low. The wind
screamed in our ears. Salt spray coated my glasses and my ears numbed.
The might of that sea! But it was a dirty sea now -- not so much whipped
cream as Bailey's and there was something in the air that stung your
eyes and was foul on the lips, the stench of oil.
Lights appeared in the spray. It was the Anglia Earl, on another
sortie from Tarbert. She bounced by, keeping a good safe distance, and
turned to port, and stood for a good while, monitoring the situation.
On the seventh day word came that hope was lost, the quest abandoned,
the Golf Star a total loss. On the eighth day I awoke and there was no
gale, no rain, no turmoil. So the dog and I headed once more for the
Scalpay ferry, and the last rites.
Outend was calm, almost summerlike. The sea beamed placidly. The air
was balmy. The Golf Star was there, rather more visible now, very
battered, but hull and superstructure intact.
The dog and I beachcombed. There were mighty hatch-covers, each the
size of two snooker tables. There were curtains and bits of clothing and
leaking cans of juice and I found an unopened pot of yoghurt and the dog
found a whole orange. There was a big transistor radio, rattling
terminally, batteries done. There was a blanket. There were yellow
safety helmets. And there was half a heavy wooden door, a ship's door,
with a real brass porthole: the glass wondrously intact, but some of the
screws gone. The brown varnish was scrawled and scratched in
hieroglyphics; half the door had been torn away, leaving one spar of
wood.
It was heavy, but I got it to the car, and brought it safely home, and
it sits now by my fireplace, with some bladderwrack drying at one end,
and a big gull's feather wedged tight between boards, so tight I could
not pull it out. Such is the power of the sea; such was the end of the
Golf Star.

APOLOGIES for absence are owed to Blantyre and Broxburn, to Twechar,
Ecclefechan, and to many other places when good fortune smiled on them.
It would have been good to share their celebrations, but not possible.
Some few of us had to be left out when they became blessed plots on
which dropped from the National Lottery various windfalls of money for
local charities.
Their success has made it tough to find a pallid excuse for how none
of the dosh came from me.
Expounding why you have not once played the state bingo game can be
wearisome. It compares for tedium with those good people who used to go
on about how they did not have television. But some steady punters keep
asking why I don't flutter.
Fibs come to hand. First, I chance the arm by trying to insist that
the lottery wraps in clover the wrong people. What have the chancers and
layabouts of the culture game done to deserve my philistine subsidy?
What strange sense of national duty is it to lay tribute at the feet of
the caliphs of opera. Gifts to charities have made that stance wobbly.
Jokes don't work either. If those nice people at Camelot (you muse)
kept all of the surplus, you'd be for it, you bet. Nobody appreciates
you are just kidding.
When lies and efforts to be eccentric fail to convince, not much is
left but to blame television. All the characters in the commercials for
scratchcards are depicted as demented. They are deranged in a different
way from ordinary people. They are not my kind of fool.
When nothing else succeeds, truth must take a hand. I confess that the
speculative nerve was once removed from the body. Not that it matters,
but how the itch was lost has an exact time and place. Recalling the
when and the where of it may be accepted as an apology even in Twechar.
In a long-bygone age I worked at Glasgow Airport as a porter -- one of
the fairly early, or first of the few, of the breed of native bearers
who now lose your luggage all around the world.
In those faraway innocent days, the airport called Glasgow was in
Renfrew, unlike now when it is in Paisley. It remains a puzzle how
pilots find their way to it when the people on the ground remain
confused about where they are.
For another reason, Renfrew was not the most reassuring place. For a
landmark it had Arkleston Cemetery. When sunshine glinted off the
headstones like runway lights, it used wondrously to concentrate the
minds of passengers. Otherwise, they had fewer worries then than now.
One load off their minds was how hard it was even for porters to lose
their luggage.
There were then so few flights from Glasgow that to have any risk of
taking a wrong aeroplane it was necessary to turn up on the wrong day.
It was a relaxed and sylvan place of echoing hangars and little
hassle. For much of the long day in the loaders' hut we played darts.
Even the aeroplanes were pally. Rapides, built by de Havilland, were the
game pigeons which flew to the Isles. Most of the heavier birds were
only Dakotas.
One memorable night the whole operation came to a standstill. Nothing
tragic: just that everybody on the base was tuned to the wireless.
Normal service was resumed when the boxing commentary ended on the 15
rounds of the fight that gave Randy Turpin a points victory over Sugar
Ray Robinson. It was that kind of place.
In our backwater way we were not unused to having big names coming
about.
One of our number let an aircraft door slam on Nye Bevan, causing him
to bleed. Although he was good about such carelessness, it was not to
the extent of giving anybody a tip. On another night, when Merle Oberon
knocked on the door of our shack, it was to cadge change for a phone
call.
As with all bearers of other people's bags, money was much on the
mind. Airport rules about tipping complicated the game. While the toffs
on the staffs of airlines were forbidden to accept gratuities, mere
porters might take.
It was a ticklish distinction to make plain to passengers, especially
those who arrived in their own planes, like Willie Nevitt, a famous
jockey of the time. Having helped him park his craft by waving landing
bats at him, I carried his cases the mile or so to a taxi, while he
became his own beast of burden with his saddles.
''I know I'm not allowed to tip you,'' he said.
''Ah, but . . .'' I tried to protest.
''Never mind the rules,'' he pressed on. ''Here's four tips for you.''
He named two pairs of horses running at Ayr races that included a
brace of mounts of his own.
So great was the excitement in the porters' hut that even darts were
forgotten. To heighten the mood of bonanza it was the weekly pay day.
Wagers on the Nevitt four were doubled, trebled, and otherwise
accumulated in every way known to a sophisticated band of sports.
To make a long story sad, some of us had to walk to work all the next
week and one of us vowed never again.
Which has been a rambling sort of roundabout apology. But getting
through to Blantyre is seldom straightforward, never mind to Broxburn.

WITH the inevitability of the first frosts of winter, a dull weekend
in London turns fretful minds to the question of the subsidies which
Scotland and Wales allegedly receive from the state. A newspaper of
suitable and bone-headed loyalty is briefed, statistics are produced,
and tangled little phrases such as ''entrenched pork-barrel preference''
are rough-hewn to shape. Thus we have yet another demand for an end to
what some are pleased to call ''Celtic fringe benefits''. Wearisome it
is, and predictable beyond belief. Yet it is important and requires both
analysis and response for, quite apart from the difficult task of
arriving at a balanced judgment on the basis of statistics which must be
used with considerable caution, the issue strikes at the unity of
Britain. That is a stark claim but justified. It is probably not capable
of being supported by a statistical argument deploying the numbers
available, but as a political argument it carries a weight which should
ensure a hearing from sensible politicians of any persuasion, and even
from those who are clearly bent on mischief.
A little background is necessary. Scotland's share of national revenue
is determined by the Barnett formula introduced by the Labour Government
in the mid-1970s as a response to the upsurge in Scottish nationalism.
As near as anyone can tell the formula, which appears generous in its
allocation of resources to Scotland, actually enshrines the status quo
of the time, which was in turn a recognition of Scotland's geographical,
social, and industrial disadvantages. Much of this is still relevant.
Scotland's land mass has not shrunk, the delivery of services to rural
areas is not easier, the health of the nation is not much better, and
the Scottish economy, though rubbing along well enough at the moment, is
assessed in this from a low base. Does all this mean that Scots are
receiving subsidies from the rest of the country? The independent
economists in the Scottish Office concluded last month that Scotland
does exhibit a pronounced structural deficit, although they were careful
to admit that the figures referred to a year in which the deficit would
be at a cyclical peak and that the rise in taxes in the past two years
must have shrunk it noticeably. Moreover, in calculating the deficit it
is necessary to use numbers which are in themselves estimates; this is
not a fact which you will hear from the axe-grinders.
If there is a structural budget deficit there must be reasons for it.
Yet we could point, as the Scottish nationalists are keen to do, to the
unidentifiable spending which takes place in London and the South-east
through the presence of government and its agencies. The fact that 40%
(roughly) of the British population in the south of England raises some
60% of national revenue could be seen as unfair, but it also illustrates
the presence of wealth and in any decent society the need to
redistribute it. Here we are getting to the point of the matter. Mr
Michael Forsyth insists that any changes in the existing formula would
be made over his dead body, although he might secretly welcome another
row on this issue to enable him to present himself as Scotland's stout
defender. The basic problem is the threat to national unity posed by the
repeated airing of the argument. Because a nation is unified does not
mean it is equal in all areas and respects, but if it wants to stay
unified it must make efforts to adjust inequalities and disadvantages.
Thus we have the Barnett formula whose basic aim is to preserve the
union. Those who advocate its removal should bear this fact in mind.

YOUR photograph is captioned, Forteviot Bridge on the Tay (October

YESTERDAY morning's Start the Week on Radio 4 unrolled the kind of
agenda which made you think getting up at all to face another seven days
was a thoroughly bad idea.
First there was a discussion of an up-coming television polemic about
the multiple threats and crises facing the traditional family unit. Then
we moved straight into a discussion of economic insecurity, prompted by
a lecture, given last night in London by The Guardian's Will Hutton.
Hutton's thesis is that society has now fragmented into three large
groups. The advantaged -- but shrinking -- 40% in well-paid, tenured
employment. The newly insecure, accounting for a further 30%, who are
either working under the shadow of redundancy or are on the kind of
short-term contracts which foster uncertainty. And the final 30%, the
disadvantaged, who either have no work or have opted out of the
above-the-counter economy.
A 30/30/40 society of this sort is neither desirable nor sustainable,
Hutton argues. He believes the pendulum will, eventually, swing back
towards a greater sense of collective security. ''Because it must''.
But, in the middle of his radio precis of his arguments, another of
Melvyn Bragg's guests gently begged to differ.
Matthew Parris, one-time Tory MP, now the parliamentary sketch writer
for the Times, called Hutton's analysis a profoundly optimistic one. I
have never felt less secure in my life, he told Hutton and the
listeners. But equally I have never felt more fulfilled.
All very well for Parris, you might think. Freed of the drudgery and
anonymity of a back-bench existence, with a good deal more than an MP's
salary from Rupert Murdoch to soothe his freelance forebodings, Parris
has more prospect of staying employed medium-term than many of his
erstwhile colleagues at Westminster.
But Parris was making a very serious point. Insecurity is, arguably,
one of the primary spurs to greater achievement, whether you happen to
be traversing a high mountain ridge or simply making your economic way
in the world. The greater the chance of falling off, the sweeter the
thrill of getting there.
My point is not that fear makes people work harder. Although it
probably does, for a time. The critical point is that a persistent sense
of insecurity may indeed be a prerequisite of a truly enterprising
society. Just as great art is seldom the product of detached domesticity
in suburbia, so creative economic enterprise is rarely the work of those
assiduously climbing this pension-lined corporate greasy pole or that.
Look around you. Many of the biggest risk takers and most successful
business builders either come from a family steeped in enterprise or
have tasted insecurity early, by dropping out of formal education, for
example. They are typically bad team players. Organisation man (and
woman) is versed in a very different game.
In his most recent book, Beyond Certainty, Charles Handy suggests that
that game's days may be numbered. ''Frankly, I now believe that
life-time employment is bad economics and bad morals,'' he writes. ''It
is bad economics because it puts the organisation into a straitjacket
and limits its flexibility. It is bad morals because it promises, or
appears to promise, what it cannot and will not deliver to more than a
few.''
The Tory party is openly flirting with parallel thoughts. John Major's
stand against signing the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty may
initially have been prompted by both the depth of Euro-sceptic hostility
on his own side and the opportunity to turn Britain into a lower-cost
magnet for inward investment within the European Union.
Keeping one lid on back-bench discontent and another on burgeoning
dole queues was a rich enough political dividend to be going on with.
But pricing ourselves into work, in global terms, by turning our backs
on that aspect of Maastricht is fast evolving into something much
bigger, in policy terms.
The Government's anti-social chapter stance coincided with redoubled
efforts to find ways of radically curbing public spending. In part that
drive has been about generating the wherewithal for pre-election tax
cuts. In part it has been a response to the longer-term apocalypse of a
health and welfare system with an inexhaustible appetite for additional
resources.
Together these challenges are stirring, within the Tory party, radical
thoughts of a permanently low-tax, small-government Britain, where
consciously-sponsored insecurity generates greater self-reliance on the
citizenry and, eventually, rekindles the fires of individual enterprise.
Now even left-of-centre Tories, like Mr Parris and Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten, see in that stance the seeds of a whole new big idea --
the opportunity to transform this country from post-industrial torpor
into a North Atlantic tiger economy, firing on a fuel Esso never dreamed
of. Two parts creative insecurity, three parts self-reliance, one part a
promise you can keep much, much more of what you earn.
The price is the dismantling of large chunks of the kind of civic
society we have known since the war. The privatising of much more than
the state-owned utilities. The insistence that we all, as individuals,
must make more personal provision for education, sickness, and old age.
Can such a package be sold to an electorate where, if Hutton is right,
only 40% of the 16-to-65s are currently feeling remotely secure? Can
Britain rediscover the hunger of the tiger at a time when many of the
Asian tigers are moving in precisely the opposite direction? Can we all,
like Matthew Parris but without his access to the Murdoch shilling,
learn to love insecurity?
In another chapter of his book, Handy points out that, in terms of
management salaries, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria top the premier
league, while Britain is in the third division. In terms of marginal tax
rates, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, together with Sweden, take
most. Britain already has almost the lowest tax rates in Europe.
But in terms of economic performance, as measured by per capita GNP,
Britain is again bottom of the second division, while the first division
leaders are -- yes you've guessed it -- Switzerland, Germany, and
Austria. Tigers aren't the only animals in the economic jungle.

FOREIGN Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, his idiosyncratic delivery of the
spoken word long a challenge to students of politics, has now set about
baffling his constituents in Edinburgh Pentlands.
Even the True Blue among them are nonplussed by a recent epistle from
the ministerial pen but, stoically, attribute his oblique approach to
pushing the party line to arcane skills picked up while dealing with
devious native military in the former Yugoslavia.
There, as Defence Secretary, he displayed great guile by wearing
patent leather shoes with his neatly-pressed khaki fatigues in order to
keep the beady eye of a Scots RSM away from the sartorial outrage of
having donned his belt, webbing, Ministers for the use of, inside out.
The letter in question carries the businesslike heading ''News from
Malcolm Rifkind'' and gets immediately to the point with the revelation:
''Sometime in the next 18 months there will be a General Election.'' So
far no argument.
But what follows cuts a new furrow in political communication. For
during the course of his bulletin of political events to look forward
to, Tory Rifkind concentrates on mentioning Labour seven times,
socialists twice, and manages no fewer than four references to a certain
Mr Blair.
For the record, his own party scores just four mentions and a certain
Mr Major is named not at all. As the Foreign Secretary says: ''The
future of our country is at stake. Do let me know your views.''
Doubtless, sometime in the next 18 months, the electorate will do just
that.
Age-old problem
IN Strathclyde, normally noted for a use of language devoid of
ambiguity, communication is likewise proving something of a problem . .
. or not, as the case may be.
A conference on ''Positive Images of Ageing'' organised by the
region's Elderly Forum has been treated to a riveting contribution from
the Hen Co-op, a collective of older women whose first book Growing Old
Disgracefully was a runaway success.
But notwithstanding the force with which they pursue their
determination to exercise control over their own future ''unencumbered
by the messages of duty we've had throughout our lives'' their message
seems not to be getting across. Admits one old biddy: ''Most men get our
name wrong -- they assume it's the Hen Coop.''
Chalk and cheese
HUMPHREY Errington, the Lanarkshire cheesemaker who has recently had
to spend almost as many days in court as stirring his curds and whey, is
this week once again locked in battle with Clydesdale District Council's
hygiene police.
Mr Errington, seven tonnes of his Lanark Blue cheese coming up for its
first anniversary in a row of refrigerators since Clydesdale officials
said it could not reach the shops, reckons his legal costs so far run to
more than #120,000. Those of Clydesdale council he puts at around twice
that.
Why the difference? Mr Errington has a clue. ''I gave one of
Clydesdale's counsel a lift the other day and he remarked he had no idea
that Lanark had such a splendid restaurant for lunch.
''He was talking about an Italian restaurant in The Vennel where,
apparently, the Clydesdale council's legal team eat every day we are in
court. It cannot cost less that #20 a head. I make do on sandwiches.''
Charge of the
light brigade
BACK in the constituency of patent leather shoes and idle webbing,
front-line intelligence is that the Thin Red Line is cheekily fighting a
stiff rear-guard action against a Treasury campaign of parsimony aimed
at trimming the military's profligate ways.
Defiantly, the Army in Scotland is planning to spend National
Lottery-sized sums at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh to install a mile of
perimeter fence lighting to a level of 100 lux -- bright enough to read
a movement order at 50 paces without a night-sight.
Notwithstanding the year-old ceasefire in Northern Ireland and the
fact that Redford Barracks endured through 25 years of IRA active
service with no better defence than Stygian gloom, the Army is
determined to get switched on regardless of cost.
An officer spokesperson explained: ''There may be a ceasefire but we
have not relaxed our state of alert. As to the cost of the lighting, we
have no way of knowing what that will be until the contractors send back
the tenders. There is no estimate.'' Time for a Treasury blitzkreig.
Fur flies
REJOICE now for those who struggle through life in the bosky southern
fringe of the Athens of the North. They are witnessing the demise of a
recession -- the local economy fighting tooth and claw to get back to
the good old days of the way things were.
For some years now, thanks to hard times in the market-place,
purchasers of goods and services have dared to expect civility and
satisfaction . . . a heady state of affairs that has lead to the heresy
that customers, just occasionally, may be right.
Such sloppy thinking is no more in the Liberton district of Edinburgh,
where a refurbished cattery claiming to be ''Edinburgh's Luxury Feline
Hotel'' is leading the fightback. The cats having been made comfy the
time has arrived, it seems, for their owners to be sorted out as well.
Thus, although most people favour holidays that run from Saturday to
Saturday -- rushing back travel-stained and weary to collect a pampered
puss -- Tower Kennels for cats is adament that no moggie will be
discharged to the bosom of its family after 12.20 Saturday lunchtime.
As the luxury feline hotel remains closed during Sundays, costly
estrangements can be considerably prolonged. Wimpish cat owners who have
allowed themselves to be delayed by nothing more serious than an
international transport strike or terrorist outrage need not bother to
phone ahead for leniency.
''Other people manage -- Monday,'' is the line served by reception.
Thank goodness the economy is picking up at last.
Upping the Auntie
FROM Queen Margaret Drive in Glasgow, the BBC's Scottish headquarters
of bi-media excellence, comes news of another management ''first''.
In an attempt to boost flagging morale among staff not poised on the
executive springboard to oblivion, bosses recently ordered an issue of
corporate T-shirts bearing Auntie's Scottish logo . . . a cotton
consolation prize in place of job security and the absence of a pay rise
within sight of that recently given to the one-time freelance John Birt.
To the astonishment of few, the T-shirts campaign to win hearts and
minds has sunk with the aplomb of an elevator in freefall. Film crew who
must venture out to meet the licence payers have put their well-focused
arguments against a uniform image and other disgruntled staff are
proving equally recalcitrant.
Reluctant to become walking billboards for the BBC they reckon there
will be enough time to parade up and down Sauchiehall Street with an
advert on their back when P45 time comes round again with Mr Birt's next
rise and the accompanying round of staff cuts.

We meet a funny man who has to be fast on the draw, Eric Kennedy
reports.
WE have all drawn caricatures of our teachers in our time, and so did
John Gahagan. Not all of his dominies appreciated his work and, as this
was still in the era of corporal punishment, he and the belt were not
exactly strangers. ''I just did even uglier pictures of them,'' he says,
looking back.
Nowadays John Gahagan receives rather more positive acclaim for his
work. A recognised cartoonist, he provides work for major publications
including The Herald and Sunday Times Scotland and finds the whole thing
rewarding both financially and artistically. ''Sometimes I'll get a call
at 1pm and be asked for a cartoon for later that afternoon,'' he says.
One gets the feeling he is talking about The Herald.
He doesn't mind. He keeps up-to-date with the news, both Scottish and
international, and is forever polishing his technique. His days at St
Mungo's Academy in Glasgow didn't manage to put him off teaching,
either, for after leaving there in 1970 with three Highers including
Art, and going to Glasgow School of Art to study graphic design, he went
to teacher-training college.
His subsequent qualification proved useful enough for, after an
enjoyable 18 months playing throughout the UK and Europe with the
well-known folk group The Battlefield Band, he found himself teaching
art for three years in a Castlemilk secondary.
It is not known whether his pupils contrived rude caricatures of him
there, but he is not the type to have minded even if they did. Teaching
was not, however, for him and meanwhile a group of his schoolfriends,
fellow caricaturists from the old days, had established an advertising
and design agency in Glasgow city centre.
John Gahagan linked up with them, moving into part of their offices,
and coming up with a lot of architectural illustration work and artist's
impressions on their behalf. It is a nice arrangement and it frees
Gahagan for the cartooning work he enjoys so much.
It is, he says, a hard area to get into. ''In my case, I met the right
man in the right pub at the right time,'' he adds. It turns out he
bumped into some Herald executives in a city-centre hostelry, tried out
some of his work on them, and found himself being asked for
illustrations to accompany letters in the Opinion page. This led to
commissions for work to accompany regular columns and business features.
But John Gahagan had spent some disheartening years sending work to
various publications ''on spec'' before his breakthrough came.
He knows a thing or two about the cartoon business, not only through
personal experience and contacts but also through his art school thesis
on the subject of Scottish Cartoonists. Revered names such as Ewan Bain
(creator of Angus Og), Tom Gentleman, Malky McCormick, John Hassall (of
Wee McGregor fame), Bud Neill, and Bill Tait of the Evening Citizen
acted as inspirations, both past and present.
There is no recognised route to the cartoonist's game although an
art-school grounding and a BA degree might be a modern-day starting
point. ''After that it's hard work, perseverance, keeping up with the
news, and trying to make contacts,'' says John Gahagan.
''And doing funny pictures of your teacher is as good a start as
any.''

There is no doubt that it is hitting retailers in general and the
corner newsagent and sweetie shop in particular
Christopher Sims examines the impact the National Lottery is having on
retailers and what long-term effects the great flutter is likely to have
on the economy in general
THE NATIONAL Lottery may have the unexpected effect of improving the
nation's teeth. There is anecdotal evidence that instead of reaching for
yet another bag of sweeties people are spending that odd pound on a
lottery ticket.
The official figures do not actually back this up, though
confectionery sales are flat compared with a year ago. There is no
doubt, however, that it is hitting retailers in general and the corner
newsagent and sweetie shop in particular.
Again hard data is difficult to come by, but Lloyds Bank chief
economist Patrick Foley estimates that the lottery has been partly
responsible for reducing growth of sales in the shops by up to 2%. Tax
increases announced in last year's Budget, but only coming into effect
last April, were also a factor. Retail sales began to slow after the
start of the lottery last November and the volume of sales has been flat
for a year now.
In contrast, overall consumer spending, half of which takes place
outside of shops, is up by 2%. It so happens that gambling, including
the lottery, is not included in retail sales whereas it is in consumer
spending, so the fact that the two figures match is more than just
coincidence. Households are spending on average #2 a week on the lottery
and the money appears to be coming out of their regular spending rather
than savings.
Those retailers lucky enough to have a lottery terminal should make up
in lottery sales what they might otherwise miss, though the margin at
5%, will be much less than they make on a chocolate bar or magazine.
Longer term, however, it is possible that when people feel more
confident about spending, shops with terminals will benefit from the
passage of punters who impulse buy other products when they are inside,
but there is certainly no sign of this effect yet. Mr Foley feels
consumer spending is likely to grow faster in 1996, mainly because of a
growing perception that interest rates have peaked.
So far there are about 26,000 retail outlets with lottery terminals,
half of which are independent shops rather than national chains. The
target is 35,000.
The area which has suffered most, not surprisingly, is other forms of
having a flutter, particularly football pools but also bookmakers and
bingo halls. The pools have been particularly hit by scratch cards --
Littlewoods have announced 500 job losses as a result, mostly in
Cardiff, though some at its centre in Glasgow. Vernons have shed nearly
100 people.
A stark warning of the loss of 2000 betting shops out of a total of
9000 has come from the Bookmakers Committee which represents the
industry, while Rank Organisation has reported a 20% fall in attendances
at its bingo clubs since the launch of scratch cards. Some of the gloom
can be attributed to a good summer which made indoor activities less
attractive, but there is no disguising the trend.
Money going into the lottery is, of course, not lost to the economy.
True, 12% of the takings disappear into the Treasury's maw, 5% is
retained by Camelot, the lottery operator, which will pass it on to its
five shareholders, and some winners will take their loot to a warmer
clime.
But much of the money spent on lottery tickets and ''Instants''
scratch cards, with spending currently running at #5000m a year, will
come back into the economy in the end, though it may be spread over
years. While shopkeepers and out-of-work pools employees may complain,
the economy as a whole should not suffer.
Virginia Bottomley, the Heritage Secretary, claimed last week that
lottery awards would create employment in a variety of industries from
the arts to sport and tourism. Literally billions would be injected into
the construction industry over the next few years and depressed areas of
the country would be regenerated.
This sounds a little high-flown but the lottery will undoubtedly
switch some of the nation's wealth away from consumption and into
investment as recipients of lottery awards spend their cash.
The benefits will, of course, only be felt evenly around the country
if awards are also spread evenly and already there are murmurings that
London is getting too much.
Greater London has received #20.74 per head of population while the
equivalent figure for Scotland is #10.95, prompting the SNP to call for
a separate Scottish National Lottery -- ''Scot Lot''. But Scotland still
came third in the regional breakdown for lottery awards.

Beverley Brown explores the links between success in sport and success
in business.
THREE of Britain's top female sports personalities came together last
week to outline their personal experiences as part of a one-day seminar
in Stirling to explore the links between success in sport and success in
business.
The ''Leaders Build Teams'' seminar was organised jointly by
accountants KPMG and Insights, the management training company set up by
England rugby captain Will Carling. Insights was founded in the belief
that the sporting environment has many parallels with business
management.
Comparing the similarities between sport and business, led them to
develop an effective programme to create a better environment for
success by seeking improvements in personal performance, particularly
the performance of leaders, the effects of which impact on every team
member. Their research suggests that what we do, or fail to do mentally,
has a much greater impact on success than what we do, or fail to do
physically. And that the key to success in business, as well as sport,
depends on how well we use our minds.
Insights has recruited international sportspeople to communicate their
experiences in sport as it directly relates to areas of personal
development. Those at the Stirling venue, were Mary Peters, Olympic gold
medallist; Rebecca Stephens who conquered Everest and Tracy Edwards,
skipper of the all female team in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht
Race.
Three different sporting arenas, but each woman's personal achievement
stemmed from their ability to take a vision and turn it into a reality.
Although the challenges were disparate, each highlighted the same
components for success: self belief, motivation, planning, preparation,
determination, commitment and communication. The same components that
are required by today's business leaders. ''The links between these
sportswomen's achievements and how these qualities can be used in
business were very clear,'' says David Nicolson, managing partner for
KPMG, Edinburgh.
The importance of attitude as opposed to aptitude was highlighted as
each of the speakers recounted their personal experiences; Stephens
resolutely believed she would climb Everest the first time she donned
crampons. Edwards left school at 15 having been told she would never
amount to anything (and later, that she was far too small in stature to
withstand the physical rigours of yachting), and Peters found the sheer
will to win gold from within on the basis that no-one ever remembers who
came second or third in athletics.
They developed their own ''culture of success'' through team-building,
leadership and communication skills -- principles that Insights have
transferred to business management theory. ''No one individual is ever
more important than the team -- and it is the same in business,'' says
Edwards, who admitted she had to dismiss her first mate 10 days before
the start of the Round the World Yacht Race. ''It was the hardest thing
I have ever done but although she was very talented, she was destructive
to the team.''
Insights' seminar formula evolved from a MORI survey of 706 UK board
directors which showed that although motivation and communication skills
were seen as the prerequisite of a successful business leader, they were
also their area of greatest weakness.
Addressing this, seminar delegates from commerce and industry spent
the afternoon undertaking a series of competitive practical exercises.
Some, like the ''Hellcube'' that could have come from the set of the
Krypton Factor, have a time limit and are designed to induce stress and
put delegate teams under pressure. All the exercises have been put
together with input from sports psychologists to bring out the various
elements of teamwork.
''KPMG and Insights put together a training seminar which effectively
highlighted team-building and leadership skills,'' said delegate Ray
Milne, assistant general manager for Scottish Life. ''Being able to
listen to the experiences of Tracy Edwards, Mary Peters and Rebecca
Stephens was a masterstroke, and the analogies between sports success
and business success were very clear. For business training, this
formula makes a lot of sense.'' Milne ended the day with a personal
success; his team set a record time for completing the ''Hellcube'' and
won a bottle of KPMG whisky each as overall winners in the practical
exercise session.

Seal culling is a highly emotive issue for environmentalists and
fishermen, but is there a solution that could satisfy the two opposing
lobbies? Kirsty Scott investigates
THERE could be few victims more vulnerable. Small, physically
constrained, and with their bellies still wet from the process of birth,
the seal pups could have done little more than look towards the barrel
of the gun that killed them.
Their slaughter -- 25 killed on two remote beaches on South Ronaldsay
-- has not only provoked a public outcry but reopened the painful debate
on how, or if, we should be keeping Scotland's burgeoning seal
population under control. It's an issue which has become mired in
emotion and rhetoric, all too often providing a platform for the most
extreme views on animal rights and the livelihood of Scotland's
fishermen.
There has not been a seal cull in Scotland since 1978 when a
high-profile disruption of culls by animal rights protesters around
Orkney turned public opinion against the practice. At the time there
were some 60,000 grey seals in the waters off the Scottish coast.
Today there are said to be around 115,000, although counting them is
an imprecise science, relying on aerial surveys of seal colonies and, on
occasion, thermal imagery and mental arithmetic.
Under the Conservation of Seals Act, anyone with the correct firearms
licence can shoot a seal in the open season. The grey seal closed season
runs from September 1 to December 31, and the closed season for the
smaller population of common seals -- 26,000 -- runs from June 1 to
August 31.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the no-culling policy is
reviewed annually and a variety of non-lethal methods of control were
being examined. ''We have to balance the interests of the environmental
and conservation bodies who would never have any seal killed, ever, and
the fishermen who would have every seal killed,'' said the spokesman.
There were reports earlier this year that the Scottish Office was
considering a scheme to use a contraceptive drug to control the grey
seal population, but the spokesman said yesterday that they had no plans
to introduce contraception.
The drug had been developed by a Canadian team of researchers who have
been testing the immuno-contraceptive on Sable Island since 1992. They
estimated that between 85% and 90% of seals darted by pellets containing
the drug failed to calve.
There is no great secret that the fishing industry would, by and
large, like to see a resumption of culling to restrict grey seal
numbers. They are seen as a pest and a predator, and many fishermen are
exasperated at the innocent, wide-eyed image presented to the public.
''I think the whole debate has been far too emotional,'' said one
fisherman. ''There are those within the environmental lobby who would
save anything, regardless of the traditions and needs of mankind -- save
the worm, save the bluebottle even.''
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation is quick to point out that it has
not called for an official resumption of culling, but said its members
were increasingly frustrated at the impact of seals on dwindling fish
stocks.
''We really do see it as a very severe problem,'' said SFF spokeswoman
Trudy Johnston. ''Our fishermen would claim that the seals eat as much
as the UK white fish quota. They are eating as much as the fishermen are
legally allowed to catch.
''What we are calling for is further research. It's acknowledged that
there is a problem and we're looking for full and proper research into
that problem. We need accurate data on the numbers of seals around the
coast. There is great dispute over the actual numbers.''
Johnston said they would estimate that in some areas around Scotland
seal numbers are rising by 20% per annum. ''The seal population has now
got so out of hand that it's not doing itself any favours. There are too
many to survive when they get to their haul-out sites.''
The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals would
disagree. SSPCA spokeswoman Pauline Mullin said they do not have a
blanket policy on seal culls in general but believed that at the moment
there was no scientific justification for such a cull.
Mullin said research commissioned by the Scottish Office a number of
years ago into depletion of fish stocks laid the blame at the door of
fishing and other fish. ''Yet seals seem to be branded as the culprit,''
she added. ''We don't feel you can say categorically that seals are
causing the depletion.''
The animal rights campaign group Animal Concern, meanwhile, has been
lobbying the Government to offer more stringent protection for the seal
population. Scottish spokesman John Robbins said about 5000 seals were
shot legally every year around the Scottish coast.
''We're totally opposed to culling, both legal and illegal,'' he said
yesterday. ''What really worries us is that increasingly seals are being
shot quite legally. Some people have got it into their heads that seals
are vermin of the sea and they appear to take delight in killing them.
''I have a horrible feeling that the fishing lobby will come out and
say let us do it properly instead of illegally. But there is no
scientific basis for a cull. There are scientific studies which show
that seals don't have any impact.''
Others believe that the killing of the seal pups in Orkney will have
done nothing to advance the debate.
Alan Coghill of the Orkney Fisherman's Association said they had been
working hard to try to resolve the seal issue and such actions could
only hurt their case. ''The seal population in Orkney has exploded in
the past few years, but we don't condone indiscriminate slaughter. We
don't feel that any member of our association would take part in this
sort of thing. We are trying to do everything up-front and this kind of
action defeats all the progress we are making.''

SAN FRANCISO: Frank Jordan, mayor of San Francisco, defended his
decision to jump into the shower naked with two radio disc jockeys, a
move some saw as a bizarre blunder that could hurt his re-election hopes
in 10 days. The normally-staid 60-year-old agreed to shower with KRQR
radio talk show hosts Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps, who arrived at the
mayor's home and said he could win extra votes. The three then stood in
the shower singing Frank Sinatra's hit My Way on the live radio show.

in northern Sri Lanka yesterday, the military said yesterday. It said 11
soldiers were killed in the battle for a road junction on the approach
to the rebels' Jaffna city stronghold. The troops are currently on a
major offensive to recapture the Jaffna peninsula from the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, fighting for an independent homeland for minority

Panmunjom
NORTH Korea today solemnly handed over the remains of a UN soldier,
possibly the first of 1119 Britons listed as missing in action, from the
1950--53 Korean War.
A white-gloved, four-man United Nations honour guard picked up the red
casket at the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom.
The first repatriation of remains in more than a year occurred as
tensions are rising on the Korean Peninsula.
It was arranged before two alleged North Korean agents shot it out
with South Korean police and troops last week. One was captured; the
other was killed three days after escaping the initial gunbattle.
Another suspected North Korean infiltrator was killed the week before
near the border.
As usual, there was little to indicate why communist North Korea chose
to resume repatriation now, or why it chose a single set of remains. Its
official Korean Central News Agency only said they ''were recently
unearthed'' and turned over in a ''humanitarian gesture''.
The North said the remains were believed to be those of a British
soldier. However, since official identification could take years or
might never be completed, UN officials said he was being received as a
UN soldier and asked that the identity provided by North Korea not be
released.
If correct, it would be North Korea's first British repatriation.
''It's very difficult to be sure on identification with these remains
being bones and records being what they were at the time,'' UN Command
spokesman Jim Coles said. ''We don't want to get anyone's hopes up.''
Of the 249 sets of remains that North Korea has handed over since
1990, only two have been positively identified by the US Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
More than 57,000 British soldiers fought with a US-led UN force
fighting on South Korea's side in the Korean War. Of those, 744 are
listed as killed in action, buried at the UN cemetery at Pusan, while
1119 others are missing in action.
At 11am today the North Koreans brought the casket to within a few
yards of the border.
Four members of the five-man UN Command Military Armistice Commission,
headed by its secretary, US colonel Ashton Ormes, and the British
member, Brigadier General Colin Paar, stood at the thin strip of raised
concrete that serves as the Military Demarcation Line between two blue
UN buildings.
They were invited across and, as North Korean troops opened the
casket, they examined the remains in virtual silence.
After taking possession from a North Korean honour guard, the UN
honour guard carried the box to a table, where they covered it with a
blue UN flag.
Chaplain Captain Claude Crisp quoted three Bible passages, led by the
23rd Psalm, as South Korean and UN troops watched from a raised pagoda.
The casket then was carried to a waiting ambulance.--AP.

RIOTERS ransacked Asian-owned shops in Zambia's tourist resort of
Livingstone near the Victoria Falls at the weekend after the discovery
of a child's heart and other remains in a shop, police said today.
The police said 110 people had been arrested for riotous behaviour and
some Asian shopkeepers had gone into hiding, fearing for their lives.
The police said the unrest began after rumours spread that Asian
shopkeepers were involved in ritual killings of six missing children in
Livingstone, on the Zambezi river.
Police said they found a child's heart and other human organs in an
Asian-owned shop in Livingstone on Friday. They said later they had
located two sites near the town where some of the missing children were
believed to be buried.
Five people, three of them Asians, have been arrested since the
discovery of the organs although none has been charged.--Reuter.

Baku
FUNERAL music played on radios throughout the Azerbaijani capital Baku
today, where residents remained in shock following a weekend underground
railway fire that killed some 300 people.
At least 200 other passengers were injured in the world's worst tube
disaster.
Rescue workers recovered some 300 bodies from the wreckage of a train
that caught fire in a tunnel, trapping hundreds of terrified passengers
in a vortex of flames and choking gas.
Unable to escape from the packed train, most of the dead were killed
by carbon monoxide poisoning from burning toxic materials in the
carriages, officials said.
The former Soviet republic declared two days of mourning for the dead.
Officials blamed the tragedy on the metro's ''outdated Soviet''
equipment.
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said some 400 people were rescued from
the subway, adding that three rescue workers, including a soldier, have
died.
Last year, some 20 people were killed in two separate terrorist
attacks on the Baku metro. Both cases are still under investigation.
Immediately after the latest accident, rumours began circulating that
the fire was also a terrorist act. Authorities insisted that there was
no indication of terrorism in Saturday's fire.
Azerbaijan, an oil-rich Turkic nation on the eastern shores of the
Caspian Sea which borders on Georgia, Iran and Armenia, has been
weakened by economic and political turmoil and war with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
With a ceasefire in the war now holding, Azerbaijan is looking for an
economic boost, especially after concluding a multi-billion dollar oil
deal with a Western consortium.
Police said a spark from a high voltage cable might have started the
fire.
Survivors said there was panic when the train came to a halt in a
tunnel between the Ulduz and Narimanov stations in the Saturday night
rush hour and the lights suddenly went out.
People started breaking windows to escape suffocation.
Rescuers pulled the injured and the dead, wrapped in rugs and
blankets, from the tunnel.
Axes were used to break open the doors of one carriage and take out
the corpses.
A police spokesman said the dead included 28 children, 126 women and
135 men.
President Geidar Aliev set up a government commission to investigate
the disaster and promised the victims' families compensation of a
million manats, the local currency, which works out at #140.
Baku's 19-mile network of 19 stations opened in 1967 and the interiors
of some of its trains are now said to be in a poor state.--AP/Reuter.

Montreal
THE people of Quebec turned out in record numbers today in a
cliff-hanger independence referendum that poses the greatest threat to
Canada's unity in its 128-year history.
People all over Canada's largest province, stretching from the Arctic
north to the US border, streamed to the polls to cast their votes on
whether the French-speaking province should secede and become an
independent country.
The rest of Canada watched with bated breath after opinion polls
showed separatists within reach of victory. Financial traders were
nervous and uncertain and investors kept away from Canadian markets.
Quebec's chief electoral officer predicted the turnout could top the
previous record of 85.6% of eligible voters in an unsuccessful 1980
referendum on sovereignty.
''I think we will approach if not pass 90% of the five million
registered voters,'' the officer, Pierre Cote, said on French-language
television.
Long lines formed outside polling stations.
The 10,000 voters in the wind-swept Magdalen Islands at the mouth of
the St Lawrence Seaway began voting at 9am, followed an hour later by
the rest of the vast province, more than twice the size of Texas.
First indications of the result will come through television
projections. But networks said if the result is as close as predicted in
opinion polls, it could take some time to get a reliable indication.
Some analysts say a ''Yes'' vote could lead to the disintegration of
Canada because an independent Quebec would split four small Atlantic
provinces from the rest of the country.
Leaders of the separatist and Canadian unity campaign voted in their
home electoral districts this morning and then began the nervous wait
for the results.
Lucien Bouchard, the fiery separatist who lifted the independence
campaign from the doldrums, voted in his home town of Alma, in the heart
of the pro-independence Lac St Jean region.
''The people of Quebec today are making a major decision for their
future, and I think it will be a 'Yes','' he told reporters, saying he
was so nervous he had been unable to sleep properly.
Montreal artist Charles Bergeron, 24, said he voted yes. ''I'm for
change and better management of our own affairs. It's probably the last
time we'll have a chance to vote for this.''
Computer sales representative Martine Gagnon, 32, voted against
independence. ''I like Canada and I want to stay in Canada. If we vote
Yes, eventually we're going to separate, and that would be wrong.''
The weather was mostly cloudy and cold, with an unseasonal chill and
snow flurries in Montreal, where the pro-Canada sentiment is strongest.
With the stakes so high, the atmosphere was tense at some voting
stations. In an English-speaking area of Montreal one voter screamed
abuse at an electoral officer, accusing her of trying to delay people
casting their votes.
Police in major Quebec cities put officers on alert in case of civil
disturbances after a close outcome.
An opinion poll published on Saturday showed a dead heat after
apportioning undecided voters. But pollsters say many voters may step
back from the brink of voting for independence at the last minute.
Inhabitants of English-speaking Canada, deeply alarmed by latest
opinion polls, planned prayer vigils around the rest of the country
during today's vote. Bankers reported significant flows of currency out
of Quebec into neighbouring Ontario.
Separatists are counting on support from a solid majority of
French-speakers, who comprise 82% of the province's 7.3 million
residents.
The referendum question asks Quebeckers to vote on whether they want
independence after making an offer to Canada of an economic and
political partnership.
But Prime Minister Jean Chretien says Canada would reject a new
partnership with Quebec and that a sovereignty vote is a one-way ticket.
Meanwhile, the White House said today that the North American Free
Trade Agreement would not automatically be extended to an independent
Quebec if that is what follows a referendum in the Canadian province.
''We've made clear that there is not automaticity to Nafta
participation in the event that Quebec was ratified as a separate
entity,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
McCurry added that he was not aware of any final legal opinion that
has been rendered by the State Department on the matter.
Nafta was negotiated and signed by the United States, Canada and
Mexico and went into effect in January 1994.
McCurry said President Bill Clinton that the question of Quebec's
status was ''an internal matter that must be decided by the Canadian
people.''
But he added that ''the president does have strong views on the
important relationship that exists between the United States and a
united Canada.''
When a reporter told McCurry that Clinton had been criticised by some
in Canada for making similar statements last week, McCurry said he
thought it was appropriate for Clinton to make them.
''This is an issue that has now attracted considerable attention here
in the United States, and particularly in states that border along
Canada,'' McCurry said. ''And it's perfectly proper for the president of
the United States, given that concern, to express himself on the
issue.''
''There is significant economic impact and significant concern there,
if there is any diminution of trade, cross-border trade between the
United States and Canada,'' McCurry said.--Reuter.

Amman
MIDDLE Eastern countries presented a project wishlist today worth tens
of billions of dollars as old tensions resurfaced at an economic summit
aimed at refocusing the region from war to peace.
In a series of ''country lunches'' and formal presentations on the
second day of the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit, seven
countries stretching from the Atlantic to the Gulf appealed for private
or government investment.
The ambitious country proposals were led by a list compiled by Israel,
which overlapped with some proposals by Jordan and the Palestinians,
that totalled $25 billion.
But the calls for investment were made as old animosities broke to the
surface.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres attacked Egypt for not making an
''economic peace'' with his country and also rejected Palestinian claims
to call Jerusalem their capital.
His comments drew an immediate response from the PLO which accused
Peres of exploiting the summit to win votes in a 1996 general election.
* The Islamic Jihad kept secret for two days the news that its leader
had been assassinated in Malta, while it chose his successor, Ramadan
Abdallah Shallah, sources in the group said today.
The group confirmed Gaza-born Shallah, 40, a Western-educated, fiery
preacher, had been unanimously elected secretary-general for the Islamic
Jihad in Palestine.
He succeeds Fathi Shqaqi who was killed last Thursday. Islamic Jihad
blames Israel's Mossad agents.--AP/Reuter.

Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates,
FILIPINA maid Sarah Balabagan, sentenced today to 100 lashes for
killing her employer, may appeal against the caning, the Philippines
ambassador to the United Arab Emirates said.
''I am happy with the overall verdict. It is fair and square although
I have a little reservation about the lashes. We may have to file an
appeal that it be set aside,'' Roy Seneres said.
An Islamic appeal court in this oasis town sentenced Balabagan to 100
lashes, a year in jail and deportation on payment of 150,000 dirhams
(#26,000) blood money to the family of the man she stabbed to death last
year.
Journalists were excluded from the court but the ambassador said the
young maid was joyful after the three-judge panel delivered the verdict.
''I could see her face was very happy when the translator told her
about the verdict. But I doubt if she was aware of the 100 lashes,''
Seneres said.
Chief Judge Sheikh Biy'a bin Saliq of Mauritania said the caning could
be carried out at any point during Balabagan's year in prison which he
said would date from today.
Defence lawyer Salman Lotfi said the person carrying out the
punishment would be required to tuck a book under the arm to limit the
force applied.
Asked whether the 15 months Balabagan had already spent in prison
since she stabbed 70-year-old Almas Mohammed al-Baloushi 34 times would
count as part of the sentence, Saliq said: ''No. That is for special
cases.''
The judge's remarks dampened a mood of elation that erupted when
Balabagan's parents and representatives of the UAE's 80,000-strong
Filipino community heard the verdict.
''Payment of blood money and immediate release,'' Philippines Labour
Attache Danilo Cruz shouted to reporters outside the court.
But Saliq said only a pardon by UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan
al-Nahayan would lead to release before the one year jail term was
served.
It was only after a personal appeal for mercy by Sheikh Zaid earlier
this month that the victim's family agreed to drop their execution
demand in exchange for blood money.
A Philippines industrialist has already donated the money to the
Balabagan family.
UAE Public Prosecutor Sultan al-Juwaid said his office would decide
whether to appeal against the verdict after reviewing it.
Balabagan's father, Karim, and mother, Bai, appeared relieved and
confident of returning to their small southern Philippines village of
Sultan Kudarat with their daughter.
''I am very happy. Sarah will go to study. We will celebrate. We will
cook the Filipino way and we will pray,'' said Bai, dressed in a black
veil and holding Balabagan's four-year-old sister Samrah.
Balabagan was sentenced to death for premeditated murder six weeks ago
after an earlier court convicted her of manslaughter and jailed her for
seven years.
In the Philippines, shock overcame joy at the news that she would be
freed but only after 100 lashes and a year in jail.
The maid, meanwhile, appeared cheerful upon returning to jail after
hearing her third verdict in four months.
''Sarah said thank God for the sentence. She was very happy,'' a
prison official told Reuters.

Zagreb
CROATIA'S ruling party was on the brink of an election victory today
that could influence talks in the United States designed to work out a
peace settlement for former Yugoslavia.
But the party fell short of the huge majority President Franjo Tudjman
had hoped for after crushing rebel Serbs in war.
As negotiators from the warring sides headed for Dayton, Ohio, the
Netherlands called an alleged massacre of Muslims by Serbs who overran
the ''safe area'' of Srebrenica in July a dismal failure for the UN but
cleared Dutch peacekeepers of blame.
Dutch Defence Minister Joris Voorhoeve said repeated requests to UN
commanders for air strikes against the Serbs were turned down until it
was too late.
Air strikes were abandoned when the Serbs threatened to kill 55 Dutch
peacekeepers they had taken hostage and to shell Srebrenica.
Backing for the Netherlands came from US special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, who told a Washington briefing today the United States was
desperate to carry out air strikes on Srebrenica but was held back by UN
procedures.
''We couldn't get them . . . the entire chain of command on both sides
of the dual key (Nato and the UN) was trapped and paralysed because of
the Dutch presence at Potocari. It was a terrible, terrible moment.''
About 40,000 Muslims had been packed into the UN protected enclave in
eastern Bosnia which was guarded by 350 lightly-armed Dutch
peacekeepers.
As results trickled in from yesterday's parliamentary election in
Croatia, Tudjman's ruling HDZ party had 43.6% of the vote with 77% of
ballots counted, the election commission said.
Political analysts said a popular backlash against the president's
orchestrated cult of personality and HDZ abuses of power denied the
strongman leader the two-thirds majority he needed to enshrine his
authoritarian rule in the constitution.
Council of Europe observers said the vote was mostly fair but warned
the government it might have to change its new election law before it
could be considered for membership.
The poll was regarded as a referendum on Tudjman's strong nationalist
line, highlighted by his avowed determination to regain the Eastern
Slavonia region from rebel Serbs.
The return of Eastern Slavonia is one of the two main problems to be
tackled at the peace talks opening on Wednesday near Dayton, the other
being a package to end 3[1/2] years of war in Bosnia.
Tudjman has pledged to recapture Eastern Slavonia by force, as he did
two other Serb-held regions this year, unless there is agreement at the
talks involving the presidents of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, who are to
arrive in Dayton tomorrow.
All three sides appear to have hardened their positions in the runup
to the talks, but European Union mediator Carl Bildt said he saw this as
tactical manoeuvring.
''It's what you would expect before parties go into a negotiation that
they themselves ought to see as probably the final one,'' he said.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he was ''moderately
optimistic'' about the peace talks as he prepared to leave for the
United States.
He spelled out his basic platform for the talks -- retaining the
territorial integrity of Bosnia, an undivided Sarajevo, adequate
international forces to police any peace accord and reconstruction aid
to be tied to human rights.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey said continued ''ethnic
cleansing'' by Serbs in northwest Bosnia must be one of the first issues
dealt with at the talks.
UN aid officials have reported that thousands of non-Serbs have been
forcibly expelled from the area around the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka, and up to 3000 men of fighting age were missing after being
separated from their families.
''You can't speak of peace, ending ethnic cleansing and returning
refugees while ethnic cleansing continues and men and women are held in
concentration camps and not accounted for,'' Sacirbey told a news
conference in New York.
Meanwhile, a convoy of Bosnian civilian trucks carrying humanitarian
aid travelled safely to and from the eastern Muslim enclave of Gorazde
today for the first time in the war.
UN Sarajevo spokesman Colonel Pierre Briere said the five trucks,
escorted by United Nations vehicles, took more than 12 hours to make the
100-mile round trip across a swathe of Serb-held territory.
''We were received by a very happy crowd,'' he said.
The UN has been operating convoys to Gorazde this month, but this was
the first civilian run.
Briere said the only trouble on the trip had been mechanical, and that
there had been no attempt by Serb forces to inspect or block the convoy.
A second trip was planned in two days.
Serb police boarded a UN-escorted bus carrying civilians from Sarajevo
to Zagreb yesterday, contravening guarantees of free movement under the
October 12 ceasefire agreement to pave the way for peace talks in
Dayton, Ohio this week.
The increasing humanitarian convoys and bus trips reflect attempts to
build confidence between the warring parties in the run-up to peace
talks opening on Wednesday in the US city.

Moscow
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin's health has improved since he
suffered a mild heart attack four days ago but doctors say he should
spend at least three weeks in hospital, Itar-Tass news agency said
today.
Seeking to ease fears over the 64-year-old Kremlin leader's health,
Naina Yeltsin said her husband was on the mend and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said the president was taking all the major decisions in
Russia.
Sources at Moscow's Central Clinic Hospital later gave a more detailed
report, saying there were ''clear signs of improvement''.
''The blood supply of the heart has stabilised and there have been no
incidents of cardiac insufficiency during the entire course of treatment
in hospital,'' one source told Tass.
But the source added: ''Even if he starts to recover quickly, it would
be advisable to be under doctors' supervision in hospital for no less
than three weeks.''
Only Yeltsin's family has been allowed to visit him since Thursday,
when he had his second mild heart attack in less than four months. No
television footage or photographs of him have been released from
hospital, prompting concern over his health.
Naina Yeltsin, one of the few people allowed to visit the president,
said little to reporters as she visited a new shop in the GUM department
store on Red Square. But asked how her husband was, she replied: ''Thank
you, he is feeling better.''
Mrs Yeltsin, who looked cheerful but tired, gave no more details and
did not say when she last saw her husband as she was rushed off by
security guards.
Chernomyrdin said Yeltsin was on the mend and in control of state
affairs. ''The president is deciding all the most important questions in
the life of the country,'' he told reporters during a visit to a Moscow
oil refinery.-- Reuter

NEW DELHI: At least 30 people drowned when their overloaded boat
capsized on the Ganges river as they returned from a religious festival,
hospital orderlies said yesterday. Witnesses said the motorboat,
carrying up to 100 people back from a festival in honour of the sun god
Chhath, capsized and sank some 50 yards from shore at Patna. It was the
third major accident on the Ganges around Patna in three months.

W Kenneth Gunn is a former editor of local newspapers in the Borders.
Although his article is strongly sympathetic towards the case for
legalisation of cannabis he claims no connection with the
pro-legalisation movement. He does believe, however, that this side of
the argument deserves to be heard
Steel was certain he would get some kind of community service . . . he
got nine months
GRAEME Steel is an articulate and intelligent 29-year-old who stays in
the picturesque village of Stow on the Gala Water in the Scottish
Borders. Almost exactly a year ago Graeme and a friend were invited to
Amsterdam to help judge an international event where his knowledge was
appreciated. However, that same knowledge which was put to good use last
November in Holland has led to all sorts of trouble at home, and Graeme
Steel is now behind bars for nine months at Saughton Prison in
Edinburgh.
Graeme, son of former Liberal Party leader Sir David Steel, and his
friend were judges at last November's Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam where
the best plants by the best growers are judged for their texture, growth
and condition. The laws in Holland are a bit more liberal than in
Scotland or indeed than in any part of the United Kingdom. Graeme grew
some cannabis in his back garden at Stow and for that crime he is now a
locked-up criminal.
But why should the cannabis hemp plant be singled out as a
''controlled substance'' and why should many governments, including our
own, continue to incarcerate people who use it?
If you were a leading industrialist or, even better, if you were a
member of the government -- any government -- and you could find some
new product that would make a lot of money, wouldn't you be interested?
If that product wasn't really very new at all and had been around for
thousands of years then you wouldn't just be interested . . . you might
be excused for kicking yourself for your previous shortsightedness and
falling over yourself to market it properly.
Think of the product seriously. It is completely natural; a plant
which grows in almost any climatic conditions from the equator to the
polar regions. You can farm it, make food from it, produce oil to cook
with, make soaps, shampoos, hair and skin conditioners from it.
You can weave it and knit it to make clothes from it; you can even
compress it to make building blocks from it. From this natural product
you can make methane gas which will fuel your car and home heating
system, and you can even make paper and the ink to print the paper . . .
all from the same plant.
As well as these uses this plant can be utilised in many more ways.
From its flowers doctors can make up herbal remedies which can almost
eradicate migraine. It can relieve period pains, help in the withdrawal
from alcohol and hard drugs.
It can even help to alleviate nausea and pain in cancer patients and
fight the ''wasting away'' effects in Aids sufferers by stimulating the
appetite.
Is this a ''miracle cure'', you may well ask, and if so why is it not
widely available?
For thousands of years it was in almost every kitchen and in every
apothecary's stock and it is only in the last two generations that the
''wonder plant'' has largely disappeared from use.
Why? Because it is cannabis hemp, or as the Spaniards call it,
''marijuana''. It is its prohibition as a Class II drug that has kept it
from general use.
Last year's Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam was sponsored by High Times, an
American magazine dedicated to the wider understanding and uses of the
cannabis hemp plant.
Graeme Steel was invited to judge the event because he is an activist
in the UK, campaigning to legalise cannabis. His fellow judges came from
all over Europe and the USA and some had strange if tenuous connections
with marijuana. Four British policemen, presumably from regional drug
squads, were included in the team among growers and users.
When I first heard of the Cannabis Cup, I have to confess that I
thought it was some strange international football match to prove to the
world that users could take part in sporting events.
In fact Graeme saw it as a cross between a craft fair and a flower
show. The five-day event takes in fashion shows where everything from
jeans to lingerie and hats to dresses are on the catwalk. All these
items are made from hemp or hemp/cotton mixtures and are good quality
clothes which would not be out of place on The Clothes Show.
Three dozen different craft companies showed everything from cosmetics
to paper; food and cooking oil; and sweaters and children's wear with
one thing in common . . . they were all made with hemp or hempseed oil
based.
If you haven't heard of the Cannabis Cup you can be excused, for
although it has been running for seven years (the eighth event is due to
take place shortly), last year was the first to be open to the public.
Amsterdam, and Holland in general, has a quite enlightened attitude to
cannabis. The Dutch haven't quite legalised ''pot'' but they tolerate
it. In Amsterdam you can go into a coffee shop, buy a scone and coffee
and also purchase, over the counter, from a selection of hemp from
different growers.
Not every coffee shop in Amsterdam allows you to smoke pot but many
do, along with restaurants and other public places.
But why were members of the British Police there in the first place,
let alone on the judging panel? What did the judges have to do to
declare the winners of the various categories?
They had to compare the entries put forward by the growers and judge
what was best by touch, smell and by smoking them.
Forget the mental picture of 300 judges all smoking around 100
''joints'' each and bringing their verdict back a week later, that's not
how it worked.
Each group of judges was assigned to one or two varieties and the
winners were arrived at by a points total.
But were the British bobbies qualified to add their expert opinion?
Well, it seems that they were, because they took part in all the fun and
all the party events that the organisers laid on for their guests.
Advocates of the ''Legalise Cannabis Campaign'' claim that many
doctors see marijuana as a medicine that works. A research advisory
panel in California, appointed by a cross-section of state officials,
reports: ''An objective study of marijuana shows it responsible for less
damage to individuals and society than alcohol and cigarettes.''
Senior representatives of the police in this country have joined in
the chorus to legalise it too, pointing out that much police time in the
drugs enforcement departments would be better used in catching users and
traffickers of hard drugs.
The fact that medical opinion is divided may be argued for some time
yet, but there is a growing feeling in health circles that cannabis hemp
is not nearly as dangerous as politicians would have us believe.
And it must be by politics that the solution is directed. The cannabis
hemp plant has the highest bio-mass of any plant . . . to the layman
that means that in its growing process cannabis converts CO[2] to oxygen
more efficiently than any other known plant. Bio-fuel technology is
vital to the future of the planet -- just think what sulphur and CFC has
done to the ozone layer.
On top of this immediate advantage, the hemp plants can provide the
world with paper without destroying a forest or without having to mature
for 30 years. Hemp can be harvested twice in one season in the right
conditions. As another bonus one acre of cannabis hemp can produce four
times the amount of paper that an acre of timber can.
Cannabis has been proved not to be habit-forming and has never been
proved to lead to users moving on to hard Class I drugs.
Therefore the only possible excuse to ban a substance which has caused
no deaths and is less harmful to humans than tobacco, alcohol or that
other daily-use drug, sugar, can only be financial or political.
Graeme Steel is in jail. While in Amsterdam last year he and a friend
who also stays in the Borders were interviewed by a ''journalist'' who
asked them some personal details about where they lived and what they
had all bought in Amsterdam. The ''journalist'' couldn't tell them who
he was working for or what paper may carry their story.
Forty-eight hours after they got home, Graeme's friend had his front
door axed down by officers from Lothian and Borders Police. His friend
stays in a quiet street and his neighbours are mostly single pensioners
who like his company and look on him as a good neighbour who passes the
time of day with them and helps them with household problems.
These neighbours were shocked when five police vehicles arrived and
officers and a dog handling team rushed up the communal stair and took
the door down before searching a council flat.
The officers took away all the damning evidence that they could find .
. . shampoo, hair conditioner, lip balm, leaflets and magazines about
hemp clothing.
That daring raid led to no conviction, but Graeme Steel wasn't quite
so lucky. He had started his own ''hemp'' farm and gone into mass
production with a harvest estimated in court to be capable of making
#30,000 on the open market.
Tiny little plants grown under a plastic sheet at the end of his
cottage doesn't quite match up to the description offered by the
prosecution.
Maybe there is still time to go before the laws of this country do
change. Graeme Steel spoke to me a week before he went for sentence. He
was positive that things were going the right way and that a relaxation
would be signalled by his own sentence. He was certain he would be asked
to do some kind of community service.
Maybe he forgot that although he has tried to keep his father out of
the picture, he is an MP's son.
Up to his sentence Graeme was taking part in a government-funded
training scheme which he hopes will help him set up his own business. He
wants to open a shop in Edinburgh . . . selling hemp shirts, hemp
trousers and hemp-based health foods.

WASHINGTON: Asthma sufferers may have trouble breathing because of a
lung muscle impairment and not just because they are sensitive to
irritants such as pollen or pollutants, researchers said. The problem
may be that lung muscles of asthmatics do not relax normally, said Dr
Alkis Togias, of Johns Hopkins Medical Centre in America whose findings
appear in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation.

Previous Halloween pilgrimages by the Society of American Magicians to

DAR ES SALAAM: Tanzania's electoral commision yesterday declared null
and void chaotic multy-party polls held in the capital on Sunday. Main
opposition parties called for an interim government to be set up as the
scale of the chaos in Tanzania's first such polls emerged.
Election officials and materials arrived late or not at all at an
unknown number of the East African country's 40,000 polling stations on
Sunday. Sunday's vote for Tanzania's presidency and parliament was
disrupted in at least eight provincial constituencies.

ENGINEERING industry employers yesterday forecast around 20,000 job
cuts in the next 12 months, despite expected continued growth in output.
They also warned the Government against replacing desperately needed
public capital spending with private finance initiatives.
Production should expand by 3% in the next 12 months, with the balance
favouring the computer and electronics sectors, according to the
Engineering Employers' Federation's twice-yearly economic trends report.
Investment is predicted to grow strongly throughout 1996 following a
20% increase in the 18 months to the second quarter of 1995.
However, after rising by 2% in the first half of this year, employment
has now levelled off at 1.77 million and is set to fall to 1.75 million
during the next 12 months, said the EEF.
Mr Ian Thompson, head of economics at the EEF, said: ''Growth is too
slow to cause the kind of problems likely to force a recessionary
downturn in 1996. In the engineering industry, output is only now coming
back to the level previously seen in 1990.''
Launching the report, EEF director general Graham Mackenzie said his
organisation was ''very worried'' at suggestions that the Government is
set ''virtually to stop public capital spending, and replace it with
private finance''.
The track record to date of attracting private finance had not been
good and if there was to be a private sector finance initiative in the
Budget, the EEF wanted to see it result in projects being started
swiftly and not used as a device for deferring much-needed capital
expenditure.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney described the EEF's
prediction as ''a disaster not only for those whose jobs are under
threat but also for the UK's manufacturing base and the economy as a
whole''.

EDINBURGH has stolen a march on Glasgow in its bid to become the
film-set capital of Scotland.
A new glossy brochure, aimed at promoting the city as the backdrop for
major movies, has won a prize in the marketing awards of Hollywood's
Association of Film Commissioners International.
The 30-page Filming in Edinburgh and Lothians booklet came first in
the association's city and county category, announced in Los Angeles
yesterday. It was praised for its photography and was described by the
judges as ''usable and functional . . . not just pretty pictures.''
The brochure was funded by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited.
The AFC International is made up of the key industry figures who select
film locations worldwide.
The brochure points out previous films which have been at least
partially shot in the area -- including Hitchcock's Thirty-Nine Steps,
Hugh Hudson's Chariots of Fire, and, more recently, Michael
Caton-Jones's Rob Roy.
The aim is to keep up the momentum which began with the success of
Shallow Grave and has continued through to Mel Gibson's Braveheart and
on to Jude, which is being filmed in Edinburgh at present.
The brochure also includes shots of various castles and country
houses, cobbled streets and alleyways in the capital, and spectacular
coastlines and moorland across Lothian. It also provides maps and
weather profiles and information on the services and assistance
available from the Edinburgh and Lothian Screen Industries Office.

POSTAL workers throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland are being
urged to endorse strike action in protest at Royal Mail plans to shed
300 full-time jobs.
Following union fears that 500 full time and 700 part-time jobs were
under threat, negotiations between the Communications Workers Union and
Royal Mail management have established that 300 jobs are threatened with
being downgraded to part-time.
However, there has been no acceptance of this situation by the UCW,
which insists that the Royal Mail is intent on undermining second
deliveries with the ultimate aim of phasing them out altogether.
A Royal Mail spokesman dismissed such claims as ''complete rubbish'',
stressed that talks were ongoing, and accused divisional union
representatives of escalating the situation.
The main problem, he said, centred on Edinburgh, where operations were
far less efficient than elsewhere and where second deliveries were being
amalgamated to improve efficiency.
However, the union maintains that the job cuts are not necessary, as
planned mechanisation is behind schedule and postal traffic continues to
rise. Against this background, cutting jobs was ''one push too far''
said UCW Scottish divisional officer George Robertson yesterday.
The 13,000 members in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be balloted
over the next two to three weeks on strike action, although Mr Robertson
said he hoped the Royal Mail would enter into negotiations that would
make action unnecessary.
The union is also urging members against using their own cars to
deliver mail, claiming that it both undermines jobs and could leave them
without insurance cover in the event of an accident.
Mr Robertson's Edinburgh counterpart, Mr John Keggie, said the union
had demanded a commitment to second deliveries and delivery standards.

MR Jim Ballard, husband of the late mountaineer Alison Hargreaves,
will deliver a public lecture in memory of her in Aberdeen on November
11.
Before her death on K2 in August, Ms Hargreaves had accepted an
invitation from the University of Aberdeen Exploration Society to
present a lecture on her experiences and considerable success as
arguably the world's most accomplished contemporary female mountaineer.
Mr Ballard said yesterday: ''The level of interest and support I have
received is an indication of just how fond many people were of her and I
hope the lecture will mark a solid start to the foundation of the Alison
Hargreaves Memorial Trust Fund which will go to help many other women
conquer their own personal mountains.''
Mr Ballard's lecture will mark the end of Explore 500, a one-day
conference for students.

The award-winning travel writer finds the Road to the Isles is a rough
ride for the tourist who journeys in hope. Over-priced meals, no room at
the inn -- and autumn puts an end to many of the attractions
I SHOULD have had the kippers for breakfast! I'd been looking forward
to my first Scottish breakfast, costing a hefty #8.50 for non-residents,
but included in my room rate. There were over 30 items displayed
artistically on the hot and cold buffet, plus kippers or haddock to be
ordered specially.
I decided to forego the cereals and dried fruits in favour of the
cholesterol-laden bacon, fried eggs, sausage, tomato, baked beans, black
pudding, and fried potatoes.
To be honest, I don't suffer the British obsession for sizzling-hot
food and red-hot plates -- but cold sausage and bacon, tepid beans and
black pudding, and eggs with a crust on them are not the best
introduction to a sharp autumn morn.
I thought back fondly to a breakfast I had earlier this summer at
Grandma Sarah's Diner in Palm Beach, Florida, in the company of a couple
of truck drivers and several bankers: ''a casserole of fresh hash
browns, diced ham, onions and mushrooms, topped with melted blended
cheeses and two eggs, as you like them'', piping hot, plus all the
coffee I could drink, at their top price of $4.59, say #3. Most of the
other breakfasts cost just $2.99, under #2.
Time to move on . . . query the #206 I'm quoted for three days for my
pre-booked self-drive car, when there's a ''special offer '' of #19 a
day in the window. Seems I'm not special enough, and in any case the
''from #19'' doesn't apply if you return the car at Glasgow Airport. It
becomes almost #70 a day.
So, with no time to spare if I wanted to visit Culloden before
catching the Loch Ness boat tour at 10.30 (the next leaves at 2.30pm,
the helpful girl at the tourist information centre had warned me), I
headed off into persistent rain.
The National Trust for Scotland has done a wonderful job at Culloden;
immaculately shaved lawns, the white cottage centre perhaps a bit cosy
for my taste, but there's nothing tame about the presentation, the
cairns, the flags, and the lowering sky.
I was sorry to have to cut Culloden short; elated already by the
glorious glimpses of the countryside, I was looking forward to my boat
trip on Loch Ness, as much for the scenery as for any possible
sightings.
The tourist information centre was specific: only two trips a day,
10.30 and 2.30. I was there on the dot.
So were quite a few others, milling around the exhibition centre,
enquiring about the boat trip -- I've got brochures about it in English,
German, and Japanese.
''Oh, that stopped about a month ago,'' the young lad at the centre
told us. ''I think there's a boat trip from Inverness though.''
Disconsolately, I settled for the ''official'' Loch Ness Monster
Exhibition, which was straightforward, informative, even slightly
self-mocking of the exploitation on its doorstep, so to speak, but too
expensive at #4 for less than 30 minutes.
The exhibition decants you straight into the . . . souvenir shop, to
be greeted by a seven-foot green plush Nessie in a Tam o'Shanter and
tartan scarf. Plus a cornucopia of Scottish and Nessie junk that defies
description: Nessie bugs, Nessie pencils, wallets, golf balls, ''Heilan
Coo'', ''Scottie Dug'' and ''Together Ness'' T-shirts, ''For the Baby
with Love'' white slippers embroidered with guess what, squeaky Nessies
and, my absolute favourite, ''Cheeky McSqueaky Nessies''.
On to Fort Augustus -- by now the rain was lashing the hills and
lochs, but I still pulled in several times just to drink in the sheer
grandeur of it all. For one heart-stopping moment I glimpsed a tiny deer
among the trees, and I began to realise how polite our Scottish friends
are when they praise our so-much-tamer English scenery.
Back to earth.
What could I do on a very wet Saturday afternoon in Fort Augustus, I
asked the tourist information centre, and the friendly lady recommended
the nearby Clansman Centre, handing me a leaflet that assured me that
''Nowhere else would you find such a real and live experience in
Scotland''.
How true, how true!
They guaranteed it would live in my memory for ever, a promise that
was completely fulfilled. The leaflet itself is a work of art.
SEE it says in bold letters, how the clans lived and survived in the
Highlands. HEAR a live presentation by a young clan member. HOLD some of
Scotland's past in your very own hands.
Entrance was #2, senior citizens #1.50, dogs welcome. I was ready to
''experience, through all my senses, the very essence of traditional
Highland life''.
With his dark hair and beard, the promised young man was leaning
against the door of the hut -- wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He looked
just like Bonnie Prince Charlie on his day off, but any hope of him
changing into native clothes was soon dashed: ''I'm half the cast, and
I'm off to shinty for the afternoon.''
''There's another lassie coming in half an hour in my place -- you can
wait if you like.'' No high-pressure selling here!
I could, both the leaflet and a notice informed me, dress up in a
kilt, and have my photo taken as a Highlander -- cost #2, or a photo
with a mere clansman for just #1.
I made my excuses, and left . . . for the warm and friendly Coffee
House, where for my lunch I paid what seemed to me to be a slightly
exorbitant #5.80 for the house speciality, Steak and Ale Pie, five
pieces of stewing steak under a mound of pastry, plus tinned peas,
carrots and of course the ubiquitous chips and an orange juice.
After lunch I hit the Road to the Isles, a nightmare, I was told, in
high summer (though well marked passing points would alleviate some of
the frustration) but a total delight in the autumn mist and rain.
Once again I was stunned by the scenery, as round every bend of the
road another piece of Scottish magic appeared. At Glenfinnan, at the
National Trust for Scotland visitors' centre, I grasped for the first
time why the Old Pretender was the genuine claimant to the British
throne -- something which after five years of studying the Stuarts for
my O-levels I'd failed to grasp.
The centre is both low key and informative, as well as good value for
#1, I was grateful for the coffee and home-made soup to warm me, and my
thoughts turned to accommodation for the night.
I'd already turned in to Inverlochy Castle Hotel, one of only two
hotels in Scotland -- the other is Gleneagles -- that are much talked
about in England. At the foot of Ben Nevis, there's nothing wild or left
to nature about Inverlochy's 500 groomed acres.
It's far too up-market to have a reception, so I ventured into the
cosy lounge with crackling fire and well-heeled guests playing chess,
and rang a bell.
A neatly dressed youth, who looked about 16, soon dampened my
enthusiasm -- a single room would cost #160 a night, dinner #42, that's
#202 in all. For the record, I could fly to Paris and spend three nights
there in a hotel, or two nights also including flights in Amsterdam,
Bruges or Madrid.
So, and this was becoming a habit, I made my excuses and left.
Farther along the route the Arisaig House Hotel's credentials looked
promising; three-star AA, four crowns STB, an imposing drive, the
entrance lined with green wellies.
No-one about; so I rang, and another youth appeared, even younger and
even more immaculate that his counterpart at Inverlochy. (Where do they
find these clones?) His face froze when I asked for the price of a
single room, reminding me of a splendid put-down my husband once had
when he mistakenly entered the portals of a Mayfair butcher's shop,
instead of the game butcher's next door. His request for a brace of
pheasant was met with: ''Our customers shoot their own . . . Sir!''
The youth asked me to wait while he disappeared through a door,
shutting it behind him -- obviously worried in case I nicked the silver.
So of course I decided to follow.
The hotel hall and drawing room were pretty, the guests in this case
were playing Monopoly (plus ca change . . .). But the young man quickly
put me in my place; they had no spare rooms, nor would they for some
time to come as a Danish film company had commandeered all they had for
the foreseeable future.
I came away with the Arisaig House colour brochure, and what a
treasure trove of modest understatement it turned out to be!
''Princely redwoods rising above the sudden abundance of Arisaig's oak
and rhododendron declare your journey done, your goal reached. Now it's
our turn to ensure that your journey has been worthwhile.''
Or how about the drawing room? ''White walls and a rare Italian
vaulted ceiling trap the southern light in a Mediterranean grip. Sofas
and chairs become islands of repose, where ambulatory ambitions are
easily sacrificed to a crackling log fire and the tinkle of malt in
crystal.''
There's lots more: in the dining room ''the chef's offerings --
supported by a lineage of fine chateau bottlings . . .'' include
''fruits de mer plucked from the ocean larder . . .''
But since it had been a bedroom I'd been looking for, I enjoyed their
description of what I didn't get:
''High above the ponticum and crinodendron, 14 spacious bedrooms shine
with unleashed light, their colours a gentle distillation of the outlook
. . . bathroom tiles glow, hot water steams. So quiet is the night, you
can still hear -- it is murmured -- the wind in the sails of the Bonnie
Prince's boat as he slips down the loch into oblivion.'' By the time I'd
read that, #65 for a single room for a single night seemed cheap!
A little further on the village of Arisaig looked idyllic but, foolish
me, I decided to press on. In truth, my first view of Scotland's fabled
West Coast was a bit of a let down, as I peered through a web of
barbed-wire fencing, Heath Robinson wiring and caravan sites.
But once past the golf courses, a succession of empty coves with sand
whiter than in the Caribbean, and the sea a translucent blue had me
honing travel writers' cliches en route to Mallaig. Once there, at the
end of the Road to the Isles, with a captive tourist market heading for
the ferries, the first view, certainly on that rainy day is -- of a
dump.
The large ''Welcome to Mallaig'' sign, repeated in Gaelic and
advertising the town's tourist services, is framed against a background
of corrugated iron sheds, warehouses and huge fuel tanks. It was not
very encouraging.
But the welcome I received from three hotels was the least welcoming
of all, downright rude in fact, the rudest I've experienced in half a
lifetime of travel.
Maybe I caught them on a bad day. I was soaked to the skin, and was
not a glamorous figure, but in a country where I frequently heard,
almost with pride, that ''we only have three fine days a year on the
islands and the West Coast'', they must be used to bedraggled sights
like me. And isn't tourism supposed to be a hospitality industry, in bad
weather as well as good?
At my first stop, the West Highland Hotel, where plaques at the
entrance announced links with American and German visitors, there was a
wedding in progress.
I rang and waited. I rang again. A girl appeared, and to my request
for a room, she abruptly replied that they were full. Did she know
anywhere I might try? ''Try the Marine.'' And without making any
excuses, she turned and left.
Was it my English accent, I wondered, though one of the flags
fluttering in the gale was the Union Jack. The other flag said
''Welcome''.
I climbed the stairs to the Marine Hotel reception, down by the
harbour, and rang the bell, which didn't work. There appeared to be a
bar inside, and the only person I could see continued to drink his pint,
though it was obvious I was looking for attention.
Spurred on by the entry in the accommodation guide which promised that
''At the end of the Road to the Isles, a warm welcome awaits you at our
family-run hotel . . .'' I eventually stepped inside and shouted as
cheery a ''Hello'' as I could muster.
At last, a woman appeared from the bar, and to my request informed me
that no, they had no rooms tonight, and no, she didn't know anywhere
else.
A similar story at the third hotel, the Glasnarcardoch (not listed, as
far as I could see, in my STB guide.)
There, after a wait the gruff, grey-haired proprietress emerged
scowling. ''Well?'' I decided, having been weaned on Dr Kildare, that a
gruff countenance can often mean goodness of heart, so I replied that a
room would be nice.
Did any rooms have private facilities? No. Did she have a phone guests
could use? Yes, but it only took the old 10p pieces.
Was there a TV I could watch, I dared to ask. This was clearly the
bitter end. ''Do you want the room or not? We're a cheap boarding house,
and what do you expect for #17?'' -- the first time the price was
mentioned.
I was almost pathetically grateful at the Morar Hotel in the next
village when the receptionist smiled as she offered me either sea view
for #50 or a back one for #32.
The hotel was homely; there was a fire in the lobby, which I had no
intention of leaving, not even for the rather heftily priced #17 dinner
menu in the now familiarly gloomy dining room, when I could have a pie
and chips for #3 by the fire.
A large group of Saga OAPs were due in, but they'd been delayed in
Skye by the bad weather. They turned up, all perky and full of their own
adventures, which I heard over the breakfast the next morning.
I enjoyed a local kipper, hoping that, with the exception of the
receptionist in my hotel, this would be the one thing in the area that
didn't jump down my throat.
The male proprietor seemed a bit out of sorts that morning. ''We've
got 31 Wally Arnolds and the Sagas,'' he was counting out to an
assistant, ignoring my friendly ''Goodbye''.
Let no-one say I didn't try; I headed back to Mallaig, to give that
place a second chance.
There was quite a crowd milling around, somewhat disconsolately as the
ferries to the Isles were not sailing due to bad weather. At the Tourist
Information Centre the girl politely informed us that there were only
two things open on a Sunday: the Heritage Centre and Marine World.
Almost exactly 100 yards down the same road, the Heritage Centre was .
. . firmly shut.
Mercifully, Marine World was open, a good #2.50's worth, with exhibits
to keep most members of the family occupied. The man in charge was
polite -- I learned to count my blessings in Mallaig.
Outside, I met some of the Saga pensioners, who like me had a coffee,
looking at the boats leaping up and down in the harbour.
''There's not much to do round here,'' they said, a bit wistfully.
''There's another hour or so before the coach takes us back to our
hotel.''
This time I was the lucky one, I thought, as I headed off in my car --
for Fort William.
TOMORROW: SOME CHEER AT LAST -- AND A STING IN THE TALE
At the end of the Road to the Isles the first view, on that rainy day
is -- of a dump
Do you want the room or not? We're a cheap boarding house, and what do
you expect for #17?

THE 23-year-old son of the ''family from Hell'' is being allowed to
leave the Raploch area of Stirling to live at a Christian centre in
Edinburgh.
Mr Hugh Haney was placed on 18 months' probation in August, after
admitting shouting, swearing, threatening violence, and demanding free
whisky in a local off-licence, and ordered to reside with his mother,
Mrs Margaret Haney, 52, at Glendevon Drive, Raploch.
Yesterday, he asked Stirling Sheriff Court to vary the terms of the
aprobation order, so that he could enter Bethany Christian Centre in
Casselbank Street, Leith.
He told Sheriff Robert Younger: ''It's something I have decided off my
own bat that I want to do.'' Sheriff Younger granted the variation.
Mr Alan Berry, the director of the 14-bed centre which offers
treatment of drink or drugs problems, said: ''People don't have to be
Christians to come here but the staff are.''

WILLIAM HAGUE, the youthful Welsh Secretary, was invited yesterday to
join Mr Michael Forsyth in a ritual act of hara-kiri if the Treasury
succeeds in burying the tried and trusted Goschen-Barnett formula which
brings extra loot to their domains each year.
Mr Forsyth has not, in fact, as we understand it, offered to go to the
stake to preserve the formula, but to resist an even grislier assault on
Scotland's money -- that we should only get the same per head as the
English.
However, this distinction had escaped Mr Ray Powell, the Labour Member
for Ogmore as he called on William to throw away his political life if
need be at the absurdly young age of 34 when some aspirants to political
power have not even made it to the Commons never mind the Cabinet.
News of this threat to the Principality's standard of living had
reached Mr Powell via the Daily Telegraph. Mr Gwilym Jones, a Welsh
Under-Secretary, said he had not realised that Mr Powell's sacking last
week as No.3 in the Opposition Whips office had so affected him that he
was now reading the Telegraph. This was probably the ''lurch to the
right'' that Labour MPs were talking about.
There was no need to worry, Mr Jones soothed. The Chancellor had
denied having designs on the formula. Regular readers will know Mr
Clarke said it first in our columns.
This pledge has freed the promising Mr Hague from the need to consider
self-immolation and pursue his glittering career, which stretches so far
ahead of him that he could actually make Prime Minister instead of
having to content himself as may some more elderly colleagues such as
Portillo, Redwood or that same Clarke with the second-billing role of
Leader of the Opposition.
Mr Hague, who is a Yorkshireman, has not attempted to ingratiate
himself with his new subjects by attempting a Welsh accent, though we
are told that, unlike his predecessor, Mr Redwood, he can sing ''Land Of
My Fathers'' without his eyes revolving. He has also gone native to the
extent that he speaks of ''our country'' when he means the Principality
and says things like ''we are doing very well'' when he means Wales is
doing very well.
Among the great strides, Wales is making is the arrival of Cardiff as
a world leader in the production of animated cartoon characters. So,
anyway, said Mr Michael Stephen (Shoreham -- Con.), though he may just
have been paving the way for his joke, ''it's a pity so many of them
have turned up as Labour MPs.''
Mr Hague has been getting about the world to sell Wales. He went to
South Korea where, he revealed, they have far more strikes than the
Welsh. He has also been to Catalonia where he met the regional president
and the Mayor of Barcelona though not, apparently, Barcelona's most
famous waiter, Manuel, who is presumably still dropping things in
Torquay.
Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, the Member for Ynys Mon (or Anglesey) complained
that if Catalonia can have a directly elected president why could not
Wales? The President at the moment is a conservative, an unlikely
outcome in Wales, which could be one reason for Mr Hague not seeing the
necessity. He contented himself with reflecting that you could be
patriotic without having a regional president or indeed an assembly.
That would only be ''a roomful of hot air,'' he declared, the mask of
proud adopted Welshmen seeming to slip.
If Messrs Forsyth and Hague do not have to slash their wrists this
year the fates look bleaker for the Overseas Aid Minister, Lady Chalker
whose budget the Treasury seems set to blow out of the water.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Foreign Office Minister, who speaks for her in
the Commons, told us: ''It's not just the volume of aid it's the quality
of aid that counts.'' The message seemed clear enough. In a hot bath is
probably the most painless way to do it, Lynda.

NEARLY one third of adults in Grampian -- about 65,000 people -- use
or have used illegal drugs.
Most are employed, drive daily, and take the drugs for enjoyment and
recreation, according to a survey by Health Promotions.
The survey, the first of its kind in Scotland, also says that more
than one third of 16 to 25-year-olds use or have used drugs. The survey
involved 3500 people, with 44% returning the anonymous questionnaire.
Cannabis was by far the most popular drug, used by all 28% of the
population who admitted to having used illegal drugs, followed by
amphetamine, LSD, and ecstasy. Very few people claimed to have used
heroin.
Health Promotions says the results support its view that drugs
education needs to be everyone's business.
Ms Louise MacAllan, managing director, said: ''What these results
suggest is that illegal drugs are being widely used in Grampian for
recreation and enjoyment.
''There appear to be many people who are using drugs regularly but who
never come into contact with the drug problem agencies or the police.
What these people need is information about drugs and their effects --
plus the skills to be able to refuse them.
''We might make better progress in helping people if we stop talking
about waging wars and winning battles and start talking together
constructively and sensibly about how agencies can bring their different
skills and resources together to find new ways to get these messages
across.''
The survey showed that 99% wanted information about health risks and
long-term effects and 88% agreed that information should help people
refuse drugs.
Thirty-eight per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds use or have used drugs,
23% occasionally and 12% regularly; 3% have given up; 51% have been
offered drugs -- 81% of these by a friend and 40% by a stranger; 78% of
daily users also drive daily; and 78% claimed they used drugs for
pleasure, 66% to relax.

MICHAEL HESELTINE came
under fire at Westminster last night as he disclosed that a
computerised system linking all Government departments to his Deputy
Prime Minister's office will cost #150,000 to set up, and #10,000 a year
to run.
The system will link his office adjacent to 10 Downing Street at the
Cabinet Office in Whitehall, to all Cabinet Ministers' departments.
One of its uses will be to inform Mr Heseltine of media-related
issues.
He announced in a Commons written reply to Liberal Democrat Treasury
spokesman Malcolm Bruce that the system would become operational next
month.
Its expense has already been attacked as ''extravagant'' in the
Commons.
Last night, Mr Bruce accused Mr Heseltine of being ''a major drain on
resources''.
Mr Bruce said: ''Michael Heseltine is more expensive to run than a
nursery school, and less effective than the Cones Hotline.
''The Government is wasting #160,000 of taxpayers money to give Hezza
the high-tech wherewithal to spy on his colleagues and steal all the
best news for himself.
''How can this waste of public resources be justified when teachers
are being sacked and class sizes increased?''
However, Mr Heseltine, in the written reply, said the new system would
make government more efficient.
''By cutting down on paper-based management systems and bringing
up-to-date information to all Ministers' offices more quickly, it will
improve efficiency and effectiveness both in individual departments and
in the despatch of collective ministerial business.
''The forward diary of policy announcements will be only one of the
new uses to which the new infrastructure is put.
''The total start-up cost, including hardware and software
development, is likely to be in the order of #150,000. Annual running
costs are likely to be about #10,000.''

THREE printers claimed yesterday they were dismissed unfairly for
alleged trade union activities when a newspaper group's printing presses
transferred to a new plant.
The Anderston Quay presses which print the Daily Record and Sunday
Mail moved to a Cardonald plant, opened officially by Labour leader Tony
Blair at the weekend during the 100th birthday celebrations of the Daily
Record.
Mr Jim Friel, Mr Andrew Irving, and Mr John Dobbins went before an
industrial tribunal in Glasgow yesterday. Among the opening arguments
was the name of their employer.
Their claims were lodged against the Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd,
but the men worked for Anderston Quay Printers Ltd and the new Cardonald
plant is operated under the name of Saltire Press Ltd.
Mr Friel, Mr Irving, and Mr Dobbins were dismissed on April 16 when
the company transferred.
Mr Friel was elected head (known as father of the chapel) of the
plant's Graphical, Paper, and Media Union, and is Scottish branch
president. The other two also had union posts and claim they were not
kept on because of union activities.
Ms Nicola Dandridge, solicitor for the print workers, said around 80
lost their jobs with the closure of the print works at Anderston Quay.
There are a number of other unfair dismissal complaints.
The tribunal heard that each of the three applied unsuccessfully for
new jobs at Cardonald and signed ''compromise agreements'' accepting
redundancy packages of up to #30,000.
Solicitor David Walker for the Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd and
Saltire Press, said there was no injustice or hardship suffered. ''These
three applicants were made payments well in excess of the statutory
maximum. They were paid substantial amounts of money.''
Mr Walker urged the tribunal not to exercise its discretion by
allowing amendments to the original application.
Mr Friel, 54, of Gordon Avenue, Baillieston; Mr Dobbins, 42, of
Gelston Street, Sandyhills, and Mr Irving, 57, of Greenholm Avenue,
Clarkston, Glasgow, are all seeking compensation.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday carpeted his Transport spokeswoman
Clare Short over her remarks in a television interview that she thought
legalising cannabis should be considered.
Ms Short issued a fulsome apology, regretting what she had said and
promising to be bound from now on by the Shadow Cabinet's rule of
collective responsibility.
She said: ''I am sorry that a few remarks on drugs at the end of an
interview on transport issues have provided a distraction from the real
political issue of the moment -- the Tories' lurch to the right.
''The party has a clear policy against legalising soft drugs, and I am
perfectly happy with it.''
Mr Blair made clear to her during a half-hour meeting that it was
''vital'' that senior members of the party did not give valuable
ammunition to political enemies by speaking out of turn.
He reminded her that all members of the Shadow Cabinet were as much
bound by collective responsibility to back party policies as are Cabinet
Ministers, and told her that the incident illustrated how their every
statement would come under ''intense scrutiny.''
Ms Short was summoned to his Commons office yesterday afternoon, after
the Conservatives had sought to extract maximum advantage from her
interview on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme on Sunday.
In it, she repeated her long-standing personal view that present
methods of dealing with drug abuse are not working and that legalising
of cannabis -- ''relatively harmless'', she said, compared to alcohol --
should be considered.
She was at once disowned by Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw, who said
that it was not Labour policy, and attacked by Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine, who said it was ''astonishing that someone who could
be a Minister of the Crown should actually want top legalise drugs.''
Conservative Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney urged Mr Blair to sack
her.
Labour counter-attacked, naming Conservative MPs who favour legalising
some drugs, including Mr Alan Duncan, a close aide of Dr Mawhinney. Mr
Duncan, earlier this year, called for legalising of hard drugs to combat
the drug dealers.
Mr Straw wrote to Dr Mawhinney asking if he knew Mr Duncan's views on
drugs before he appointed him as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. He
recalled that in his book, Saturn's Children, published last May, Mr
Duncan said all drugs banned by the 1971 Dangerous Drugs Act --
including heroin, cocaine and cannabis -- should be legalised.
He argued that prohibition was ''doomed to failure'' and that
Government anti-drugs initiatives were ''just posturing''.
Labour also named former Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken as one who
has spoken in favour of legalising cannabis.
Challenged on this, Mr Heseltine said neither Mr Aitken nor Mr Duncan
were current members of the Cabinet.
Labour's new Chief Whip Donald Dewar said Ms Short's view was ''an
honest personal opinion.'' However, he added: ''The party's position
remains absolutely clear. We are not in favour of the legislation of
cannabis.''
The sack for Ms Short was never on the cards. She was elected earlier
this month to the Shadow Cabinet but has had a turbulent career as a
Front Bench spokeswoman.
In 1988, she was sacked from as a junior Employment spokeswoman for
opposing the party line on the Prevention of Terrorism Act and in 1991
resigned as Social Security spokeswoman in protest at Labour support for
the Gulf war.
A Labour colleague, Mr Tony Banks, MP for Newham North- West, said:
''Although I agree with everything she said, perhaps that wasn't the
right time to say it.''

SINN Fein and Northern Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram are to
have talks in Belfast today in a new attempt to end the deadlock on IRA
disarmament.
Mr Martin McGuinness will be looking for a Government response to
proposals put to Mr Ancram when the two last met earlier this month to
try to end the impasse which has effectively put the Ulster peace
process on hold.
However, last night there was no sign that the Government was prepared
to move on demands that the IRA must begin a process of arms
decommissioning before Sinn Fein can enter all party talks.
The British, Irish and American Governments are agreed on proposals to
set up an international arms commission to take charge of the
decommissioning process while dialgoue gets under way.
However, Sinn Fein is reluctant to sign up to it.
* Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble began a visit to the United
States yesterday, hoping to persuade the Clinton administration to renew
pressure on the IRA to begin dismantling its weapons.
Mr Trimble, elected leader six weeks ago, said he would also press his
plan for elections to set up a political forum and establish democratic
mandates.
In a press briefing, Mr Trimble declined to say whether he believed
President Clinton had backed away from his position earlier this year
that the IRA must begin dismantling its weapons.

HARRODS owner Mohamed Al Fayed is expected to reopen the row over
Government ''sleaze'' when he appears before the Commons Privileges
Committee tomorrow.
A Harrods spokesman said yesterday that Mr Al Fayed was determined to
tell ''the whole, unvarnished truth of widespread, political
conspiracy'' when he gives evidence to MPs.
Last year, a spate of sleaze claims levelled at the Government, and
involving Mr Al Fayed, cost two Ministers their jobs.
The committee has invited Mr Al Fayed to the Commons tomorrow evening
to help in their probe of the ''cod fax'' affair.
Controversy surrounded the disclosure that the Guardian newspaper had
used Commons headed notepaper bearing forged signatures to research a
cash-for-questions story.
A fax, bearing the Commons logo, was sent to Mr Al Fayed's Ritz Hotel,
in Paris, in a bid to get a copy of then Cabinet Minister Jonathan
Aitken's bill to find out if he had stayed at the hotel at the expense
of an arms trader.
A spokesman for Mr Al Fayed said yesterday: ''He is determined to tell
the full truth of the matter with all the details of the circumstances
which led up to the incident.''

A SUSPENDED depute grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland
has applied for legal aid to take four of its top officials and a former
grand secretary to court.
In his plea for aid, Mr Max McConville alleges the institution broke
its own constitution and that the trustees acted contrary to rules of
natural justice.
In an exclusive interview, Mr McConville insisted he had no regrets
over speaking to The Herald about the secretive world of the
brotherhood, which he joined 30 years ago.
Of a 20-month, hitherto internal battle to clear his name, he said:
''I am prepared to be judged by the membership, not those who I believe
broke its constitution. I am no longer a member, so can talk publicly.
The genuine, loyal, true Orangeman will back me 100% if proved
correct.''
In a precognition, 48-year-old Mr McConville states: ''It is quite
clear from the sequence of events that the Grand Orange Lodge have acted
throughout in a manner that is unconstitutional and indeed contrary to
the very terms of the written constitution of the Orange Institution.''
His aid application argues he was denied written notice of a lodge
trial on February 5, 1994, for alleged misconduct at a lodge meeting the
previous August. He was ''severely reprimanded''.
It also complains that the re-trial -- when sentence was increased to
a year's suspension -- was out of date and there was no provision in the
constitution for it to take place.
Finally, he protests that appeals -- where the punishment rose by
another 12 months -- were in breach of procedures, with trustees
refusing to attend and justify charges.
Officials Mr McConville wants to take to court are the Most Worthy
Grand Master Magnus Bain; Senior Depute Grand Master Ian Wilson; Grand
Secretary Jack Ramsay, and Junior Depute Grand Master John Thomson, plus
former Grand Lodge Secretary David Bryce.
Mr McConville's lawyer said: ''If the application is granted, papers
will be passed to counsel to frame a writ in the Court of Session. I
believe Mr McConville has a good case, because it is clear that
laid-down procedures were not followed.''
However, legal opinion is mixed. Some suspect the board will reject
the application on grounds that no financial loss has been incurred,
with nothing against which to measure his personal loss.
Others consider it will be backed on the grounds that ''rules of
natural justice'' apply. Indeed, a lodge in Midlothian was granted a
court order in 1990 preventing its expulsion over allegations of an
unauthorised collection for the Loyalist Prisoners' Aid Fund after
arguing it was contrary to natural justice because it was not
represented or given a chance to put its case.
Mr McConville's disputes with the hierarchy arose within months of
being elected a depute grand master in 1993, one of six in the
80,000-strong Scottish institution. At the same time, he was appointed
chairman of the laws and constitution committee which draws up the
institution's rule book.
Another element in the troubles involved Mr McConville's perceived
loss of a 19-year-old girlfriend to an older man who is a self-confessed
criminal.
Her father was also a senior official at Lodge 131, Lily of the
Valley, in Maryhill, but it would appear Mr McConville's subsequent
complaint about the man backfired.
Mr McConville is seeking reinstatement, without loss of service or
title, on grounds that his civil liberties, rights, and privileges
contained in the rule book were denied.
He will consider his position if not granted legal aid. A mechanic, he
has been unemployed for more than four years.
The Grand Orange Lodge said in a statement that it was aware of the
action but would make no further comment.

THE Government took a fresh step yesterday to improve standards in
public life by publishing guidelines for former Ministers accepting
jobs.
It also unveiled a new Civil Service Code setting out the values which
public servants are expected to uphold.
Mr Major is determined to brush up the image of his administration
which has been tarnished by a series of ''sleaze'' allegations.
The new guidelines for Ministers are intended to answer accusations
that some were taking jobs far too quickly after leaving office.
Concern deepened after several Cabinet Ministers stepped into
well-paid jobs often in businesses they had helped privatise.
Publication of the code for civil servants comes amid concerns over
the relationship between Ministers and civil servants generated by the
sacking of the head of the prison service Derek Lewis.
The code sets out the constitutional framework within which civil
servants are expected to operate and the values they are expected to
uphold. It will come into force at the beginning of 1996.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Roger Freeman told a Westminster
news briefing: ''We have arguably the best Civil Service in the world
and we want to make sure its integrity, impartiality and independence
are properly preserved.''
Former Ministers will be able to consult an independent Advisory
Committee on Business Appointments over any post they wish to take up
within two years of leaving office.
The former Minister will be asked to fill in a form detailing any
contacts he had with his prospective employer or competitor companies
while in office.
SPEAKER Betty Boothroyd told MPs yesterday they must declare their
interests before speaking in next Monday's debate on implementing
proposals for reforms in the Commons by the Nolan Committee on standards
in public life.

A TORY MP is under pressure to quit as a Minister's aide after
declaring he is prepared to see innocent people hang as the price for
bringing back the death penalty.
Mr Robert Spink, an aide to senior Home Office Minister Ann
Widdecombe, caused a row at Westminster after his reported comments in a
speech to Young Conservatives in Felixstowe.
According to a newspaper report, he said he thought it would be worth
it, if for every person wrongly sent to the gallows, hundreds of murders
would be prevented.
Urging Home Secretary Michael Howard to bring back capital punishment,
Mr Spink, Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ms Widdecombe, added: ''I
do not expect we would ever have to hang an innocent person, but even if
we did, I would still be happy to vote for hanging because someone has
to protect the maximum number of people in society.''
Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Alan Beith said that Mr Spink
''has no business staying in his Home Office job. If he is prepared to
see innocent people hang as the price for bringing back the death
penalty he should think again.''
Mr Spink insisted the quality of justice would be greatly improved if
capital punishment was reintroduced.
''The key question is whether innocent lives would be saved.
''Seventy-five convicted murderers released after serving their
sentences have gone on to kill a second time.
''Therefore hanging would be a specific deterrent.
''I honestly believe we wouldn't hang innocent people, capital
punishment would only be used for the most vicious, inhumane,
pre-meditated murders.''

THE father of a French technician who disappeared after losing his job
visited Glasgow yesterday to appeal for help in the search for his son.
Mr Pierre Caillet, who returned to France last night after spending
the weekend in Scotland, met officers from Strathclyde Police who have
taken over the missing-person investigation.
His son Emmanuel, 26, left his home near Paris on August 14 and was
believed to be heading to Scotland for a three-week holiday. He is
thought to have been travelling in his red Austin Mini, which has a
white roof and bull-bars and bears the French registration 62-55-YH-92.
He has not contacted his family since leaving France. A credit card
transaction in his name was traced to the Stakis Ingram Hotel, Glasgow,
in payment for an overnight stay on August 16-17.
A television appeal was later made in Grampian, where the grandfather
of the missing man has connections. Following the broadcast, two women
reported a possible sighting to police but no other movements in the
area have been established.
Mr Caillet, a corporate banker, said: ''I first became worried at the
beginning of September. When he goes away, he sends us postcards from
time to time, although there are no rules with him. I have no idea what
has happened. I fear everything.''
After inquiring at his son's workplace, Mr Caillet discovered Emmanuel
had lost his job as a water treatment technician several months before
but had not informed his family.
''He has a lot of pride in himself and I'm sure he thought it would be
difficult to tell us,'' Mr Caillet said.
Emmanuel, who lived alone, was often depressed, according to his
father. ''He is a quite lonely person. He doesn't communicate easily or
enjoy communication with people.''
The detective leading the investigation, Superintendant William
McMillan, said: ''There can't be many red Minis like Emmanuel's with a
French number plate going around Scotland and we would ask people to
keep an eye out for it.
''However, there are few other leads and Emmanuel could be anywhere.
If anyone has any sightings of the car or other information we would
appeal for them to come forward.''
One line of inquiry is that M Caillet, who is interested in medieval
buildings, may have planned to visit Iona on his holidays and police in
Oban have been alerted.
He is described as 5ft 9in, of medium build, with brown hair and brown
eyes. He does not speak much English but can communicate enough to get
by. Those with information should contact Strathclyde police, Stewart
Street, on 0141 532 3000.

THE Government Bill aimed at enabling prisoners in Northern Ireland
serving fixed-term sentences to become eligible for release halfway
through their sentence went through all its Commons stages in less than
four hours last night.
It will now go to the Lords, but is set to become law before the end
of the current parliamentary session next week. Ninety prisoners could
be released before Christmas, but Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew insisted yesterday that the Government had not produced an
amnesty for terrorists.
In a Commons debate on the second reading of the Northern Ireland
(Remission of Sentences Bill), he said the legislation made no
concession to those who claimed falsely that those convicted of
terrorist offences somehow become political prisoners. ''It makes no
concession to terrorism at all,'' he said.
The Bill would restore the practice which existed in Northern Ireland
until 1989 that all prisoners serving fixed terms of imprisonment,
regardless of the nature of their offence, became eligible for release
at the halfway point of their sentence, rather than two-thirds of the
way through.
All prisoners would have to serve 50% of their sentence, and those
released under the new remission rules would be liable for recall to
prison if, at any stage up to the two-thirds point in their sentence
''their continued liberty would present a risk to the safety of others
or they are likely to commit further offences.''
Sir Patrick told the House the reason for introducing the Bill now was
that the Northern Ireland ceasefire had been maintained for more than a
year. The risk of further terrorist-related offences being committed by
the offenders affected by the Bill was seen to be ''greatly reduced.''
The Northern Ireland Secretary disclosed that if the new scheme was
introduced in early December, more than 90 prisoners would be released
before Christmas. A further 98 would be released on licence during 1996:
their release otherwise would not have been due until 1997 or 1998.
By the end of the decade, about 340 prisoners out of the 471 to whom
the Bill currently applies would have been released, but ''many of those
who have been sentenced to the most heinous offences would, under the
provisions of the Bill, still remain in prison until at least the end of
the first decade in the next century.
For Labour, Northern Ireland spokesman Tony Worthington said his party
broadly supported the Bill, but he voiced a number of reservations which
he hoped the Government would bear in mind.
The main one was that Sir Patrick was ''policeman, prosecuting
counsel, judge, jury and Court of Appeal'' in the matter. He continued:
''If we were in government, we would not wish to assume all these powers
to ourselves. In doing so, one would bring upon oneself condemnation.''
Mr Worthington said: ''Any approach must never, ever forget the
victims of the violence. The crimes that were committed were heinous and
the perpetrators have to serve their sentences.
''Even after this measure is passed there will be considerable numbers
of prisoners with considerable sentences to serve. Justice can only be
done if the victims are not just remembered, but honoured by our passing
legislation that respects their suffering,'' he said.
Mr Alan Beith, for the Liberal Democrats, said the Bill was welcome
but had been badly drafted in some places.
Democratic Unionist the Rev William McCrea (Ulster Mid) said he
welcomed the Bill if it was designed to bring Northern Ireland into line
with the rest of the UK. However, voicing concern that it could be the
beginning of a number of concessions to terrorists, he demanded: ''Just
exactly what is going on in the province?
''What are the backdoor deals and skullduggery that is going on to try
to placate those that have been and still are carrying out awful acts of
butchery against a law-abiding community?''

A FIVE-year-old girl saved her pregnant aunt from a vicious late-night
sex attack by alerting a passer-by, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Colin Anderson chased sex attacker George Brown, 24, caught him,
and held him down until police arrived.
Yesterday, Brown, of Restalrig Road, Edinburgh, admitted indecently
assaulting the 20-year-old woman, who was six months pregnant, and
threatening her niece on June 29 this year at a footpath in Leith Links
in the city.
He was originally charged with attempting to rape the woman but the
Crown accepted his not guilty plea to that part of the charge. Sentence
was deferred at the High Court in Edinburgh until November 17 for
reports.
Advocate depute Craig Scott told the court the sex attack victim and
her niece were taking a short cut across the park at about 11.30 at
night after visiting a friend.
She was nearing the bowling greens at the links when she became aware
of a man following them.
Mr Scott said: ''The next thing she was aware was being grabbed from
behind.''
The screaming woman was repeatedly punched in the face and warned to
stop calling out. Her niece was also in ''a state of considerable
distress'', said the advocate depute.
However, the woman told the girl to run to a nearby road and try to
get help.
After his capture, Brown told police that he wanted to attract the
woman's attention to ask her the time.
Defence counsel Derek Ogg said Brown wanted to express his shame to
the court and to offer his profound apologies to the victim.
Brown, who suffers from learning problems, had little or no insight or
memory of the attack.
''It comes as a shock to everyone who knows this young man that he
behaved in this way,'' said Mr Ogg.
Lord Clyde agreed to allow Brown's bail to continue on condition that
he keeps to a 9pm curfew.

<TEXT>
A CRACKDOWN on noisy car alarms, limiting the length of time they
sound to 30 seconds, is being considered by the Government, junior
Transport Minister Steven Norris disclosed last night.
He is also looking at a ban on audible signals, such as bleeps or
taped voice announcements, which confirm the setting or unsetting of the
alarm system.
The move follows public anger over noise nuisance from vehicle alarms,
particularly those which have been known to sound all night.
Mr Norris said in a Commons written reply: ''Car alarms are a positive
deterrent to car crime.
''I am aware, however, of the concern felt about their potential for
noise nuisance and will shortly be consulting on regulations which will
reduce the maximum period of audible alarm signal permitted to 30
seconds for new alarms and prohibit the use of audible signals to
confirm setting/unsetting of the alarm system.''
He added: ''The proposed changes, while not compromising the security
value of car alarms, should considerably reduce any noise nuisance.''
Labour Transport spokesman Graham Allen welcomed the announcement,
saying: ''It has taken the Government 16 years to do something about
this, but it is a move in the right direction. It is essential we have
car alarms that do their job without anti-social consequences.''

SCOTLAND's funding formula guaranteeing a proportion of UK expenditure
is to remain intact, it emerged last night.
This followed a day of negotiation which saw Mr Michael Forsyth press
his case with Mr William Waldegrave, Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
Resentment over what is perceived in some English quarters as too
favourable a financial settlement to Scotland and Wales has bubbled over
in recent days, prompting reports that the Goschen/Barnett formula could
be scrapped to free money for tax cuts.
This groundswell gained some credence with comments from Mr John
Townend, the chairman of the Tory back-bench finance committee,
indicating there should be equality of spending across the UK.
Treasury sources insisted yesterday the formula was not being called
in question. Speculation that the Treasury could be planning to breach
the formula, by which Scotland and Wales receive a fixed percentage of
any increase or decrease in English spending, was denied.
However, Labour sources last night indicated the speculation had been
manufactured to create an artificial conflict from which Mr Forsyth
could emerge, claiming a victory for Scotland.
The SNP claimed that Mr Forsyth's dangerous scaremongering on the
state of Scottish finances, as part of his campaign against
constitutional change, had brought about the threat of an English
backlash in the first place.
In the Commons Welsh Ministers rejected Labour claims that the
formula, which also affects them, was under threat. Welsh Under
Secretary Gwilym Jones said: ''The Chancellor is on record as saying the
formula for Wales has not changed and that remains the case.''
Mr Clarke said in an interview in The Herald this month that he had no
plans to change the formula which has been criticised by some English
Tory back-bench MPs. They attacked it for providing much higher public
spending in Scotland and Wales per head than in England.
In July, Mr Forsyth told The Herald a proposal by one group of Tory
MPs that Scottish spending should be brought down to the same per capita
level as English would be carried out ''over my dead body''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday that, while
Labour would vigorously oppose any attempt to get rid of the
Goschen/Barnett formula, he suspected the publicity currently being
given to it was part of ''an annual stage-managed fight over it to
distract attention away from savage Tory cuts in overall expenditure.
''The real test for Michael Forsyth is not whether he can stop the
Treasury from cutting expenditure to English levels. After all, Kennneth
Clarke stated in a interview with The Herald that that is not going to
happen.
''The acid test is whether Michael Forsyth can protect Scotland
against cuts in real terms in Scottish expenditure.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''This shows the clear dangers of the
irresponsible propaganda that Michael Forsyth has been producing from
the Scottish Office.
''In peddling the line that Scotland is somehow subsidised by the UK
Treasury, he is leaving himself wide open to more experienced members of
the Cabinet trawling round desperately for Tory tax cuts aimed at Middle
England.''
There was also a sceptical response from the Scottish Liberal
Democrats. Chief executive Andy Myles said the formula had served
Scotland and the UK for many years and the Treasury would try to break
it at their peril. ''Any such moves would have incalculable effects
within Scottish and UK politics,'' he said.
Although the formula stays in place for another year, the Scottish
Office is having to try to fight off a Treasury squeeze on its budget,
as is the Welsh Office, whose Secretary of State William Hague was also
locked in negotiations with Mr Waldegrave yesterday.
Some English Conservatives believe that Tory support and
representation in Scotland and Wales is so low that the party has little
to lose by scrapping the formula, devised at a time when it was argued
that Scottish needs in areas such as health, education, and transport
were relatively greater that those in England.
The two Secretaries of State, however, have a card up their sleeve in
the shape of Mr Major's determination to make Labour's devolution plans
a key issue at the next election and make defence of the Union a main
plank in the Tory campaign.
A Scottish Office spokesman said Mr Forsyth had already made his views
on any change in the formula ''crystal clear'' but did not comment on
public spending round discussions.

A YOUTH yesterday admitted supplying ecstasy and amphetamine at the
Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr, where three drugs-related deaths occurred
last year.
Charles Partridge, 19, of Lomond Place, Castlepark, admitted supplying
drugs between April 1 and August 31, 1994. He also pleaded guilty to
possession of cannabis.
Advocate-depute Mrs Valerie Stacey told the High Court in Kilmarnock:
''Hanger 13 was a disco at which raves were held and where drugs appear
to have been widely available . . . it is my understanding that the
accused was known as a person who could supply drugs and that he
supplied them to a number of people on several occasions.''
Mrs Stacey agreed with Lord Milligan that raves at Hanger 13 should be
referred to in the past tense as they no longer took place.
Mr Bill Dunlop, defence advocate, said Partridge had left home after
domestic difficulties and moved into accommodation next to Hanger 13. He
began to attend the raves and ''out of boredom'' became involved in the
taking of drugs.
Mr Dunlop said his client had finally given up going to Hanger 13
after the deaths of three young men last year.
Lord Milligan called for a social inquiry report and remanded
Partridge in custody until November 14. He told him: ''This is a very
serious matter indeed.''

A CAR thief was jailed for four years yesterday for killing a teenage
mother when he crashed into a wall in a stolen sports car.
The High Court in Inverness heard that James Thomson, 19, of
Stoneywood Road, Aberdeen, was already disqualified when he crashed the
stolen Fiesta XR2 following a high-speed police chase in the city centre
on January 16.
Passenger Lea Forbes, 18, who had a four-month-old baby, died as a
result.
Thomson pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and breaching two bail
orders, as well as driving while disqualified and without insurance.
He admitted driving the stolen J-registration car at speeds between 80
and 100mph along Great Northern Road and St Machar Drive in Aberdeen and
failing to stop when instructed to by police.
He admitted losing control, striking a lamp-post and wall, causing the
car to overturn, and causing injuries to passengers Lea Forbes, Lee
Gajownik, and John Johnstone. Lea Forbes, of Formartine Road, Aberdeen,
was fatally injured, and Thomson admitted causing Ms Forbes's death.
Defence counsel William McVicar said: ''Thomson bitterly regrets his
immature and irresponsible behaviour, which resulted in the tragic death
of a young lady he was friends with.
''The harm he has done to this other person and her family will live
with him to the end of his days.''
Mr McVicar said Thomson accepted there was no alternative to a
custodial sentence.
Jailing Thomson and banning him from driving for 10 years, Lord
Cameron told the teenager, who had been banned three times in the past
three years for driving offences, that he had shown a ''blatant
disregard for the law''.
Advocate-depute Archie Clancey said police spotted a car which had
been reported stolen at 2.30am. ''They gave chase but could not keep up
with the high-performance car. They put on their blue light but Thomson
ignored them.''
The police car continued its pursuit and another car was called.
Before it arrived, Thomson had crashed the car. ''He attempted an
overtaking manoeuvre but lost control,'' said Mr Clancey.
''The car overturned and came to rest on its roof. Lea Forbes was in
the front of the car face down. An ambulance arrived but paramedics
could not find a pulse.''
A post-mortem examination revealed Ms Forbes died from serious neck
injuries sustained in the crash.
The other passengers were bruised and cut, while Thomson broke his arm
and had fractures in his pelvis and hip joint. He needed surgery and was
eventually discharged from hospital on February 28.
Mr Clancey said unemployed Thomson had a number of road traffic
convictions and on June 2 last year, he had been banned for five years.
He added that Thomson was currently serving a 12-month sentence in
Polmont Young Offenders' Institution in Stirlingshire after being
sentenced on April 5.

<TEXT>
TRADER Nick Leeson could serve as little as one year in jail if he
admits his part in the collapse of Barings bank, according to a legal
expert in Singapore.
The Briton decided at the weekend to abandon his fight against
extradition from Germany, prompting speculation that he might be seeking
a plea-bargain deal.
Mr Leeson, 28, will be flown from Frankfurt at the end of November to
face 11 fraud and forgery charges.
His London-based solicitor, Mr Stephen Pollard, said: ''His concern
all along has been that whatever court ultimately deals with him, it
should be a court which doesn't easily accept the rogue trader approach
but looks at what he did in the context of what others did.''
Mr Walter Woon, a law professor at the National University of
Singapore and a member of the Singapore parliament, said Mr Leeson's
initial fears of up to 14 years in jail were unfounded.
''If he pleads guilty and co-operates fully, and there is legal
evidence that he was just a pawn in a larger game, he might get off with
a sentence of only 12 months.''
Mr Woon added: ''Now that the Singapore inspectors' report is out, and
points to higher-ups having had some knowledge, this considerably
strengthens his case for mitigation, but not total exoneration.''
A major factor in Mr Leeson's decision appears to have been the
publication this month of the report, which criticised some of his
superiors, saying they concealed his unauthorised trades.
Mr Pollard said: ''Our fear was that the Singapore charges focused on
the trading and that, as a result, the court in Singapore could adopt a
restricted approach, that they could say, 'We don't want to hear about
the management in London'. To that extent, we argued he would be tried
more fairly in London.
''The Singapore inspectors' report, combined with the unreceptive
approach of the Serious Fraud Office, have together suggested to me that
our analysis may have been wrong.''
On Sunday, Mr Leeson's Singapore-based lawyer John Koh refused to
comment on whether a deal had been struck for some charges to be dropped
in return for Leeson's testimony against bank executives.

THE formula that helps determine the level of public spending in
Scotland was originally drawn up in the last century.
Its first author, in 1888, was a Victorian Chancellor of the Exchequer
by the name of George Goschen, who decreed that Scotland should receive
11/80ths (or 13.75%) of all UK spending, in line with population
statistics.
Until 1958, the Goschen Proportion was applied and, for the following
two decades, Scottish Office civil servants operated successfully
without it, getting more than their share of departmental and other
spending, without the remainder of Whitehall paying much attention.
By 1979, after the resurgence of nationalism in Scotland,
understandable jealousies crept in across the Border and the system had
to be refined.
Labour's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Joel Barnett, added his
name to the formula by bringing in new figures and ordaining that,
eventually, the equation would converge into equality.
The Barnett appendix, which for the first time regularised the
position of Wales, specified that for all new identifiable spending,
Scotland would receive #10, England #85, and Wales #5.
It was intended to compensate Scotland for special needs determined by
geographical and historical factors.
So the magic figure of 11/80ths became 10/85ths (or 11.76%). If
English and Welsh programmes, such as law and order, were combined, then
Scotland would get 10/90ths (or 11.11%).
The theory was that, if applied over a very long period, the formula
would produce convergence. In 1979/80, England had 82.9% of identifiable
expenditure and Scotland 11.4%. By 1990/91, this had moved slightly in
England's favour (83.3%) and slightly against Scotland (10.9%).
This refinement prevailed until 1992 when the Tory Chief Secretary,
Michael Portillo, clipped the figures back further -- and used only
their decimal equivalents: 10.66% for English comparisons, and 10.06%
for England and Wales.
His justification was based on a recent census, which showed the
Scottish population had, in terms relative to the rest of the UK,
fallen. However, its effect was stark, axeing #60m from the Scottish
Office budget in one swoop.
The formula is not fixed in stone and could be changed again. However,
just last week, Lord Barnett (as he is now) told BBC Scotland that the
system remained a fair one and accused Tories like Mr Michael Forsyth of
spreading scare stories about the possible cost of home rule.
He said: ''I would guess they are trying the hopeless task of
convincing the Scottish people that a Labour Government in the UK would
be disastrous for them. As I understand it, looking at the opinion
polls, they are faring disastrously.''

A FORMER university student who last month won #4000 damages from
police after a history-making case, was fined #160 by Glasgow
magistrates yesterday.
Aamer Anwar, 27, now said to be an #18,000-a-year racial equality
officer, was foung guilty of punching a fellow student during a melee at
the Queen Margaret Union in June l994.
He was also found guilty by magistrate Marion Sweeney of maliciously
breaking a glass door and of a breach of the peace.
Anwar, of Park Road, Kelvinbridge, Glasgow, denied committing the
offences after being asked to leave the union, where a disco was about
to take place.
He claimed he was assaulted by doormen after being asked to leave for
''no apparent reason''. He also claimed he broke the glass door by
accident after his false teeth had been punched from his mouth.
Anwar said there was bad blood between himself and students on the
board of the union because they were mainly former fee-paying schoolboys
with opposite political views to his.
He claimed the doormen and board members shouted racist remarks at him
and laughed as he searched for his front dentures.
Last month, he was awarded damages against a policeman whom he claimed
knocked out his front teeth while arresting him for illegal fly-posting.
Anwar, a student radical at the time, claimed that Constable Graham
McKee rammed his face into the ground and told him: ''That's what
happens to black boys with big mouths.''
After yesterday's court case Anwar, a science graduate from Glasgow
University, said he was disappointed with the verdict, and said that the
convictions might prevent him from going on to take a law degree.
His lawyer, Miss Gioia Modlin, said she was considering appealing
against the conviction.

BRITAIN's biggest private bus operator, Stagecoach, yesterday called
for a radical change in the industry's deregulation framework, in an
effort to improve standards of service and make bus travel more
attractive.
The Perth-based company said possible changes in bus deregulation
should place greater emphasis on the quality of service provided by
operators of local authority-subsidised services and less on who can
provide the lowest bid to the council or passenger transport executive,
as this led to poorer services, often using older buses.
The Department of Transport has set up a bus working group to look at
possible improvements to the deregulated regime. Labour has said that it
would re-regulate the bus industry.
About 85% of all bus services are provided commercially by bus
operators without local authority input but the remaining 15% are
subsidised by the council or, as in Strathclyde region, by the local
passenger transport executive.
Mr Neil Renilson, managing director of Stagecoach (Scotland), said:
''These subsidised services are secured under compulsory competitive
tender arrangements and, by and large, the arrangements are very
cost-driven. It's the lowest tender that wins and that has led to a
decline in the standard of service.
''What we would very much like to see, if there are going to be
changes to the deregulation framework, is that any future tendering
arrangements are not purely cost-driven and should have some quality
element built in.''
Mr Renilson told a conference on the bus industry in Glasgow that
lower successful tenders led to old buses on the roads and low pay rates
for bus company staff, adding that any new arrangements should include
age standards for vehicles. He said a greater degree of partnership
between bus operators and councils was required.
Mr David Begg, Lothian Regional Council's transport chairman, later
told the conference that obstacles placed in the way of transport
authorities' efforts to promote the use of buses after deregulation were
not insurmountable.
''Local authorities can and should influence the pattern of transport
usage,'' he said. ''If Lothian Regional Council are able to help create
the right conditions for bus travel in the region, then I have no doubts
that bus users will be rewarded by better services that can only act to
increase patronage back towards pre-1985 levels.''
Mr Renilson earlier rejected speculation that some of the six major
British bus groups -- Stagecoach, FirstBus, National Express, British
Bus, Go-Ahead, and Yorkshire Traction -- would merge into supergroups.

MORE than 90 vessel owners have applied to join The Fishermen's
Association Ltd -- a breakaway group born from unrest over the EC Common
Fisheries Policy.
The group was formed last month when nine directors of the Scottish
White Fish Producers' Association (SWFPA) -- including its chairman and
vice-chairman -- resigned after a vote to remain in the Scottish
Fishermen's Federation.
The SFF has refused to back the Save Britain's Fish Campaign which
urges withdrawal from the CFP. The new group backs withdrawal.
At its first meeting, Mr Tom Hay of Peterhead and Mr John Thomson of
Lossiemouth were confirmed as chairman and vice-chairman. Other
directors were co-opted from Lossiemouth, Fraserburgh, Peterhead,
Aberdeen, and Penzance.
Iain Smith &amp; Co, former SWFPA secretary, has been appointed secretary
to the new association.

AN international fraud investigation covering 13 countries over two
and a half years has recovered millions of pounds defrauded from the
Salvation Army, much of which will now be spent on good causes in
Scotland.
A trail of deceit and sophisticated bank movements was followed
methodically by lawyers around the world, including Scotland, where a
Highland inn was bought with #250,000 of the charity's cash.
The Salvation Army's solicitors went to court time after time to seize
assets when they were uncovered. Arrests were also made by the police in
Holland and the US.
It was finally announced yesterday that not only had all the missing
millions been recovered but interest was also paid on it.
Initially $8.8m (#6m) had gone missing as naive Army staff were duped
into making non-existent investments. The final amount recovered was
$13.7m (#9m) to include interest and substantial recovery costs.
Glasgow and Edinburgh are amongst the largest beneficiaries. A nursing
home and day-care centre for the elderly costing #2.5m will now be built
in Glasgow. A much-needed #2m extension will be put on a men's hostel in
Edinburgh.
Both projects were in danger of being scrapped, or at best seriously
delayed, because of the huge fraud operation.
A grateful General Paul Rader of the Salvation Army admitted yesterday
that they had learned some hard but valuable lessons. ''We can now put
this matter behind us and continue with our mission to relieve poverty
and sickness,'' he said.
There were also celebrations for the Army's solicitors, Slaughter and
May, who were called in to try to find the missing millions.
One senior member of staff was sacked, and three others transferred,
after the fraud was uncovered. They had naively agreed to a scheme to
invest Army funds in what they were told was a lucrative financial
market in bank letters of credit and other bank instruments. It did not
existed.
In May, 1992, $10m (#6.6m) of the Army's funds, much of it gathered in
door-to-door collections by charity enthusiasts and by Army bands
playing in public, was transferred to a bank in Antwerp, Belgium, to
make the supposed investments.
The following month, $8.8m (#6m)was transferred to a bank in
Luxembourg where, according to Slaughter and May, it allegedly came
under the control of Birmingham businessman Stuart Ford, appointed by
the Salvation Army as a fund raiser and financial consultant, and
Egyptian-born businessman Gamil Naguib.
Over the next three months, the money was dissipated and lost. About
$3m (#2m) came back to the UK to be used by Ford to repay numerous
personal debts and for supposed loans to a company called Phoenix
Airways, and to discharged Scots bankrupt Lawrence Gillick, who used
#250,000 of the Army's money to buy the Castle Inn at Dornie.
Other smaller amounts were squandered, with the remainder, $4.35m
(#2.85m), placed under the control of associates of Naguib. It passed
through three Luxembourg banks before it was finally lost.
It was to have been used to buy a $5m (#3.67m) American bank
instrument at a discount. New Yorker Harold Glantz, working with a Dutch
associate, Guido Haak, deceived Naguib's associates and used the stolen
money largely for his personal benefit. Glantz bought properties in
Malibu, Santa Monica, and Hollywood.
All this was gradually uncovered as the Army called in Slaughter and
May. They had to make investigations throughout the world, with 43
lawyers' firms involved in litigation.
Eventually, Glantz was arrested in New York at the request of Dutch
police. He has since been charged with separate financial crimes in the
US not involving the Salvation Army. Haak was prosecuted for
embezzlement in Holland and is now in prison.
Meanwhile, Slaughter and May were involved in 50 High Court
applications to recover the funds. Substantial money judgments were
secured againt Ford, his company Tilen Securities, Naguib, Gillick, and
Phoenix Airways.
Settlements were made with a number of other parties which are subject
to strict confidentiality provisions. All stolen funds were traced, even
though it had been dispersed to England, Scotland, Belgium, Luzembourg,
Holland, California, and New York.
Among the properties repossesed and sold was the Castle Inn. Gillick,
son of Rangers player Torry Gillick, is believed to be living in Geneva.
Both he and Ford were interviewed by Scotland Yard's fraud squad.
The Salvation Army has worked closely with the Charity Commission to
tighten up its financial controls and management procedures.
The number of trustees controlling its assets has been increased and
stringent checks will be made on the backgrounds of experts called in to
help with invesment advice.
General Rader added that they were immensely grateful that the public
continued to support their charitable and spiritual work after the loss
had been discovered.

<RECORDNO>975618357</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A KIRK minister was almost sucked into the propulsion unit of a
nuclear submarine carrying Trident missiles, it was claimed yesterday.
The Rev John Ainslie was swimming towards the 15,000-ton vessel after
being thrown out of his lightweight canoe in an incident involving a
Ministry of Defence patrol launch, a court heard.
At Dumbarton Sheriff Court, Mr Ainslie, who runs Scottish CND, pleaded
not guilty to causing a breach of the peace by putting his own life in
danger while trying to obstruct HMS Victorious.
He also denied endangering two military policemen by forcing them to
rescue him from the path of the warship as it approached its base on the
Clyde in May 1994.
MoD Sergeant William Anderson, who was coxswain of a high-speed
inflatable launch escorting Victorious, told the court how he and a
colleague intercepted the canoe as it was paddled across the bows of the
submarine.
Sergeant Anderson, 43, said: ''Victorious was travelling at four or
five knots through Rhu Narrows at the entrance to Gareloch.
''Anything that got in its way was going to get run over -- and it was
our job to stop anything getting in its way.''
He added: ''This canoe was very close to the front of the sub. As my
colleague grabbed Mr Ainslie round the waist, I applied full power to my
engine.
''As we began to tow the canoe, the drag-effect caused it to capsize
and my colleague lost his grip on Mr Ainslie.
''He broke free from the canoe -- and swam towards Victorious. He got
very close to it . . . about two metres with his head pointing towards
it. I couldn't understand why he was doing it . . . it was a crazy thing
to do.
''Officers from another MoD launch plucked him from the water at that
point.
''If he had got any closer, he would have been dragged under and into
the propulsion unit of the submarine.''
Sergeant Anderson denied suggestions by defence solicitor Mr John
Carroll that Mr Ainslie had been in no danger -- and that the MoD
officers had placed him in danger by towing his canoe into the
submarine's path.
He said: ''We had to act quickly to get him out of the way.
''I knew that using full throttle when trying to tow the canoe could
make it capsize -- but there was no alternative.
''All I knew was that the submarine was very close indeed. I don't
know how close because I was frightened to look -- but I could feel its
presence.''
He said that a collision, even with a small plastic canoe, could have
damaged acoustic tiles on the outer skin of the submarine.
The officer also denied that before grabbing Mr Ainslie in the canoe,
his vessel had twice ''buzzed'' it in an attempt to make it unstable or
capsize it.
Video tape of the incident was shown in court. Sergeant Anderson
insisted it did not give a true reflection of events because the
long-range lens distorted the distances between the vessels involved.
Mr Ainslie, of Cecil Street, Hillhead, Glasgow, is currently Scottish
CND's only full-time administrator.
He was one of scores of protesters who greeted the #100m submarine as
it arrived on the Clyde from sea trials off the coast of the US.
MoD Constable Andrew Benson, 33, was in the craft which eventually
picked up Mr Ainslie.
He admitted driving his boat over the top of the minister's empty
canoe, and added: ''I was more concerned about him than his canoe.
''My only intent was to get to him and pull him from the water.
''When we got alongside him, he was kicking away from our boat and
trying to get back towards the submarine.''
Mr Benson said that after his arrest, Mr Ainslie was initially charged
with breaching maritime regulations relating to collisions at sea.
He said: ''The rules are designed to aid safe navigation and establish
the right of way. One of them is that vessels under 20 metres in length
shall not impede larger vessels in a narrow channel.''
This charge was later dropped.
His colleague in the police boat, Constable John Carr, 44, told how Mr
Ainslie was ''washed round the bow'' of Victorious and under its fin.
He said: ''He seemed to be caught in its slipstream as it moved. He
was about three yards from the casing of the submarine.''
When Mr Carroll suggested that nuclear submarines do not have
propellers but are powered by water-propulsion, Mr Carr said: ''They
have a single multi-bladed propeller . . . I've seen it in a dry-dock.''
The trial was adjourned.

CAMPAIGNERS in East Lothian yesterday criticised a decision not to
include the A1 between Edinburgh and Newcastle in a bid for Euro-road
funding for 1995 to 1999.
The 120-mile stretch of road, which has claimed scores of lives in
motoring accidents in recent years, is now unlikely to be upgraded to
dual carriageway before the twenty-first century.
The European Commissioner for Transport, Mr Neil Kinnock, revealed
last week that the stretch -- part of the trans-European network -- had
been omitted from the Government bid for European funding between 1995
and 1999.
The chairman of East Lothian District Council, Councillor George
Wanless, yesterday accused the Government of ''reneging'' on a
commitment given before the last election to dual the road.
''If the A1 is seen as important enough to include in the
trans-European road network, it is clearly regarded as vital to the
economy of the country and Europe as a whole.
''We have consistently argued, on both economic and safety grounds,
that dualling work should be given the priority it deserves,
particularly in view of the Scottish Office's commitment to the latest
phase currently underway between Tranent and Haddington, and the next
phase between Haddington and Dunbar,'' he said.
He described the news as ''disappointing'' but said the council, along
with local Labour MP John Home Robertson, would continue to press the
Department of Transport on the merits of the case and would be seeking
an early meeting with MEPs, MPS, affected councils, and Mr Kinnock to
discuss the best way forward.

EDINBURGH'S International Conference Centre has been granted a
drinks-licence extension until 2am on Saturdays and Sundays, despite
objections from local residents.
The city council's licensing board yesterday granted the extension
until March 31 when, under a policy for cutting back on opening hours,
it will revert to 1am.
The board was told there were objections from the West End and
Tollcross Community Councils, the Morrison Street and Tollcross
Residents' Associations, and a 64-signature petition against extending
the centre's drinks licence.
Local resident, Mr Rodney Basford, told the board the move would cause
''a lot of ill will'' and ''alienate residents''. Mr Basford complained
of noise when people left the conference centre, taxis ''revving up'',
and car doors slamming. ''This is not just another pub,'' he said: ''It
is a huge building holding hundreds of people.''
Questioned by board members, Mr Basford admitted that he had been a
resident only since December of last year. It was pointed out to him
that there had been only one complaint about noise since the centre had
opened and that had been by him. An environmental health department
official said the only complaints it had received had been when
construction started.
Solicitor for the conference management, Ms Audrey Ferrie, said there
was no question of the extension being used for discos or nightclubs. It
was to complement the facilities of the centre. It was for delegates
attending conferences, not the general public.
Those leaving the centre did so with decorum, she said, and she cited
some of the organisations involved, ranging from the Royal College of
Nursing and Scottish Financial Enterprise to the Scottish Labour Party
conference.
After debate, the board agreed to the extension by 10 votes to three.

A TEENAGER blew his hand off with a firework he was building from
instructions sent out on the Internet, it was revealed yesterday.
Nick Peacock, 16, was following the DIY notes when the firework
exploded as he held it on his knee in his bedroom on Sunday night. The
blast shook the house in Box, Corsham, Wiltshire. Police later removed
three of the fireworks.
A spokesman said: ''We found a sheet of paper at the house which
contained instructions for making explosive devices.
''We believe the boy got them from a friend, who in turn took them
from an American address on the Internet.''
After the blast, the boy was taken by ambulance to the Royal United
Hospital in Bath then transferred to the burns unit at Bristol's
Frenchay Hospital.
Surgeons operated but were unable to save his hand. He also suffered
serious leg injuries. His condition was described as ''stable''
yesterday.

A FORMER top football referee led a bizarre double life in which he
stole hotel keys and later returned to burgle the rooms, a court was
told yesterday.
Later, some of the proceeds of the crimes were found in lockers used
by Michael Peck, 50, when he was deputy headmaster at a secondary
school.
Peck, of Kendal, Cumbria, pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, four
of burglary, and two of obtaining property by deception. The charges
involved a total of #3300.
He asked for 75 other cases to be taken into consideration at Carlisle
Crown Court.
Peck, married with two grown-up daughters, was ordered to do 200
hours' community service and pay a total of #554 compensation to three
of his victims.
Mr Tim Holroyde, prosecuting, said that until April 1995, Peck was
deputy head of Queen Katherine's School, Kendal.
After he left, the staff locker room was cleared. Those used by Peck
during his 15 years as deputy head were emptied.
''Some surprising items were found in the lockers,'' said Mr Holroyde.
''There were various wallets with credit cards and driving licences, a
number of cameras, various items of men's clothing, and some clothing
magazines.
''A total of 30 keys were recovered from the lockers.'' The police
were called and Peck arrested.
''He was, from the outset, entirely forthcoming with the police. He
proceeded to tell about the many matters before the court.
''It is right to say that there appears to be no other material before
the police other than the defendant's confession.''
The court was told that in addition to teaching, Peck had been a
football referee for more than 20 years. During this time, he refereed
almost 600 league matches. A high point in his career came in 1989, when
he was linesman in the Liverpool/Everton FA Cup final.
He left teaching this year to become referees officer for the
Endsleigh Football League, a post from which he has since resigned.
''He has been a football referee of high calibre, which has taken him
on travels around the country,'' added Mr Holroyde.
He would visit hotels, not only to stay but also to have a meal or a
drink. ''Mr Peck told police that he had, over a period of 10 years or
more, gone on numerous occasions into the accommodation parts of
hotels.''
Peck would then steal keys that were left in hotel room doors.
''He would do nothing there and then but on some later date, he would
return, let himself in and, if there was property worth stealing, he
stole it.''
There were some keys he never used and sometimes he didn't take
anything when he entered the rooms.
Peck told police: ''I certainly knew what I was doing. It was a
spontaneous act.''
Mr Holroyde said Peck stole because of a personal problem, which was
not disclosed in court.
Mr Leonard Webster, defending, told the court: ''My client had
hitherto an impeccable character.''
He had left teaching to take the football league job: ''It was the
culmination of his selfless dedication to refereeing, which started when
he was a teenager and undergraduate.''
Peck had deliberately left the property in the lockers knowing it
would be found. ''He was a referee who blew the whistle on himself.''
Judge Alistair Bell told Peck: ''Having regard to the promptness of
your confession and the promptness of your plea of guilty, this is not a
case for imprisonment.''

THE Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) and trade unions
are to step into the ''jobs for the boys'' row over council jobs by
publishing their own advice on appointments procedures.
Mr Mark Irvine, Unison's Scottish local government officer, said
yesterday he regretted such detailed advice had not been available at
the start of the reorganisation process.
Mr Irvine, critical of the Staff Commission in the past for not being
firm enough with councils over appointments procedures, said the
commission clearly did not have the resources to police Scottish local
government.
He added that Unison was anxious that such matters should not simply
be handed over to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Irvine claimed the new guidelines would be warmly welcomed by the
unitary councils. There were still many appointments to be made and it
was important that staff were properly protected.
Following allegations that some appointments to the new councils were
not being made on merit, discussions have been taking place between
Cosla and the trade unions on how to promote best practice.
Now model agreements will be issued by their joint forum over the
coming weeks on appointments procedures, grievance and disciplinary
procedures, job sharing, carers leave, and maternity pay and leave.

A HI-TECH project which is set to revolutionise history education in
Scotland was one of two initiatives to benefit yesterday from the latest
#11m lottery hand-outs north of the Border from the Millennium
Commission.
A #7.4m grant has been awarded to the Scran 2000 initiative and a
further #3.7m has been given to provide a new multi-purpose centre for
the Orkney Islands.
Announcing 200 grant awards totalling more than #84m, the chairman of
the Millennium Commission, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, said: ''Scran is an
innovative and very high- quality project.
''It will present Scotland's cultural resources in a multi-media
format and will provide a new opportunity for easy, exciting access to
Scotland's rich history for people all over Scotland. It will bring
Scottish objects in London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow within easy reach of
the most remote school in Scotland.''
The National Museums of Scotland, the Royal Commission on the Ancient
and Historical Monuments of Scotland, and the Scottish Museums Council,
which represents more than 200 museums throughout the country, spent
more than a year developing a blueprint for the #15m project, one of the
biggest millennium projects north of the Border.
The remaining costs will be met by a funding partnership.
Dr Mike Spearman, acting director of Scran 2000, said in Edinburgh
yesterday that the project would enable schools, colleges, universities,
and libraries to link in to a vast national database of 1.6 million
records, photographs, and artefacts via the internet or CD-ROM,
providing a state of the art educational resource for the twenty-first
century.
The first pilot scheme in the project is expected to be under way by
the spring.
Dr Spearman said: ''This is a real first for Scotland. Scran will help
to prepare and provide the educational resources that are increasingly
needed in modern education. It is essential we are able to teach the
next generaion of pupils about their own culture and its place in the
world.
''By the millennium, we hope it will be an integral part of Scottish
education.''
He stressed the importance of having up-to-the-minute teaching
material with a strong Scottish slant at youngsters' fingertips, and
said the initiative could become a role model for other IT projects.
Ms Jane Ryder, director of the Scottish Museums Council, said it would
mean everyone would have the same level of access to the wealth of
culture preserved in Scotland's museums collections, regardless of age,
ability, or status, and regardless of where they live.
''A schoolchild in Shetland will be able to receive the same quality
of information as the student of Open Learning in the Borders,'' she
said.
Meanwhile, in Orkney, jubilant councillors who have led the bid for
funding for the #7.4m Pickquoy Project, incorporating a 1500-seat arena
as well as extensive conference, sporting, and administration
facilities, said they were delighted with its #3.4m grant.
The vice-convener of the islands' council, Mr Jim Sinclair, said it
would have a significant impact on local employment.
''This project, once complete, will complement the existing range of
local facilities and amenities in each parish and on the islands. It
should attract more major cultural and sporting events to Orkney.
''The uses of this facility are endless and it will undoubtedly
enhance the quality of life.''

SCOTLAND'S latest jackpot family picked up a cheque for #1.59m at the
Camelot office in Glasgow yesterday.
Sharing the winnings were Mr David McCombe, 63, his wife Myra, 61, son
Brian, 39, his wife Jill, 30, daughter Sandra McCombe, 35, and her
boyfriend Jackson Traynor, 23, who bought the winning ticket. All live
in Hawick.
Mr Traynor, a knitwear machinist, completed the ticket by choosing
numbers whose pattern on paper formed a mirror image of those on
Sandra's ticket. It was the first time he had filled in a lottery grid.
Once they had confirmed their win, the syndicate hid the ticket inside
Rolly, Sandra's teddy-bear pyjama case, for safe keeping.
The syndicate will divide the money equally, with each couple getting
more than #531,000.
Mr David McCombe, who will retire, ruled out a permanent separation
from their home town for himself and his wife. ''A day away from Hawick
is a day wasted,'' he said.
Five tickets matched all six numbers in the draw, each winning
#1,594,352. The winning numbers were 7, 16, 27, 33, 35, 44 and the bonus
number was 5.

THE Tate Gallery has been awarded #50m of National Lottery money.
The Millennium Commission's award will fund an annexe of the gallery
in the derelict Bankside power station on the Thames in Southwark, south
London.
It will ''form part of the nation's celebrations of the year 2000''
and is the third of 12 such projects to mark the millennium, the
commission said.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Heritage Secretary and chairman of the
commission, said the annexe would create 650 permanent jobs in the area
and 2400 across London as a whole.
Earlier decisions to give #50m to the Royal Opera House and #30m to
redevelop Sadler's Wells theatre have caused accusations that lottery
money is being used to subsidise the pursuits of the rich.
However, Mrs Bottomley said: ''Just as the Pompidou Centre has
successfully attracted visitors to a previously neglected area of Paris,
the regeneration of Bankside will create a new focus south of the Thames
and revitalise the surrounding area.''
Labour's Heritage spokesman, Dr Jack Cunningham, agreed. He welcomed
the decision to expand the gallery, which regularly has to shut its
doors to visitors on weekends because it is full.
However, he said, parts of the country had been completely excluded
from the three millennium handouts so far.
''The Tate Gallery is a major national institution and as such
deserves support,'' he said.
''However, I am concerned that, to date, none of the millennium funds
has gone to the North of England and I intend to table questions about
this.''
The #50m grant, just less than half of the total estimated #106m cost
of the project, will also fund a 300ft observation tower in the power
station's old chimney.
Sculpted gardens will lead on to the recreated Shakespeare's Globe
Theatre, which itself recently benefited from a huge lottery handout.
The Tate attracts three million visitors a year, 800,000 of them from
outside London, gallery director Nicholas Serota said.
He thought the scheme would create a new focus for tourism in the
capital, creating a chain of developments along the south bank of the
river, stretching from the South Bank Centre to London Bridge.
Appearing at a news conference alongside the Tate's director was Mr
Jeremy Fraser, leader of Labour-run Southwark Council, which has so far
contributed #1.5m to the project.
Mr Fraser said the decision would prove valuable to an
under-privileged inner city area where unemployment currently ran at
25%. The new gallery would attract hotels, restaurants, and shops, he
said.
''This is not just a victory for the arts, this is a victory for our
fight against unemployment.
''It is a project for local people, some of whom are the largest
buyers of lottery tickets,'' he said.
The Southwark MP, Mr Simon Hughes, said: ''In the tradition of
Bankside over the centuries, this will be a real people's museum,
contributed to by real people, accessible to real people, and enjoyed by
real people.''

A GLASGOW businessman who fled to Italy eight years ago after
resetting #25,000 worth of stolen jewellery was fined #5000 yesterday.
Renato Fella, 55, had been extradited back to Scotland.
His family paid the fine after his being sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff
Court and he was released. His wife and family ran the family ice cream
making factory and a fleet of 12 vans, the court heard.
Solicitor-advocate Maurice Smyth said: ''He has languished in an
Italian jail for four months before spending another three in prison
here.'' He said Fella had endured a self-imposed punishment by being
separated from his family and had lost eight years of his children
growing up.
Fella, of Braidbar Farm Road, Giffnock, near Glasgow, admitted
resetting the jewellery after it had been stolen from a traveller's car
in Saltcoats in October l987.
Police found the jewellery and #35,000 of Fella's money in the boot of
his wife's car.
A co-accused, Stuart McKenzie, was jailed for two years for his part
in the crime.
Sheriff Eric Galt told Fella that because of the time he had spent in
custody and his self-imposed punishment he could impose a fine instead
of a jail sentence.

A NATIONWIDE campus hotline recorded daily complaints of racism in its
first year of operation, the National Union of Students said yesterday.
The phone-in result has caused union leaders to call on the Government
to enforce anti-racial legislation in tertiary institutions.
Campus Watch received 381 reports of racist activity, ranging from the
distribution of leaflets to written death threats.
Callers also complained that racist groups were infiltrating student
organisations and attempting campus recruitment.
While right-wing groups such as the British National Party still
featured, the union found most complaints were against extremist Islamic
groups.
Many of these concerned the fundamentalist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which
has already been banned from some colleges.
Mr Douglas Trainer, president of the NUS in Scotland, said there were
no breakdown figures to gauge the extent of racism in Scottish
institutions.
Some callers alleged incitement of violence against Jews and
homosexuals.
Most callers complained of racist groups distributing leaflets and
other material.
There were 64 reported verbal threats of violence, 16 written threats
to individuals, and 47 complaints of actual physical intimidation or
harassment.
Union president Jim Murphy said the survey marked a milestone in the
union's campaign against racism.
''This is the first investigation by any organisation into the
problems of racism on campus and the results give rise to serious
concern,'' Mr Murphy said.
''We challenge the Department for Education and Employment and the
Home Office to properly enact current legislation on incitement of
racial hatred and take action to ensure that universities and colleges
are places of learning free of intimidation and hatred.''

a verbal hand grenade into yesterday's meeting of Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce and retired to leave members pondering its repercussions.
In a speech entitled All Change for the Railways, Mr Ivor Warburton
questioned, in a voice sometimes weighed down with irony, where this
change would lead.
A Chinese scholar -- he studied the language at Cambridge -- Mr
Warburton told his audience somewhat inscrutably: ''Confucius says, it
is only the very wisest and the very stupidest who never change.''
As the man in the driver's cab at InterCity, Mr Warburton had been
expected to bid earlier this year for the train operating franchise for
what was the Tories' flagship rail privatisation. That privatisation has
now been ''parked without date,'' he said.
Moves towards privatisation had begun in April 1994. During that time,
InterCity had failed to sustain previous performance levels, he said.
''Much managerial effort has been deflected into executing the
re-organisation plans, and it was a great disappointment to me and my
team when the momentum towards the offer of InterCity West Coast train
services as a franchise was arrested in August and all further work
towards this objective ceased while the implications and impact of the
route modernisation project are worked through.''
The ageing Glasgow-London artery needs modernised at a cost of #600m
to #1000m. Its condition is such that Mr Warburton has already warned of
''catastrophic failures'' unless a refurbishment goes ahead soon.
However, Mr Warburton had not come simply to dwell on InterCity. There
were many examples of railways playing a practical and growing role in
other parts of the world, he told his audience.
''There are few examples these days in this country. It seems to be
one of those solutions which is all right for other nations, but not for
us.
''The Heathrow Link and Jubilee Line Docklands extensions are under
construction in London as is a light metro line in the West Midlands.''
But what had happened to further electrification of the rail network
in Scotland and more services into Glasgow and Edinburgh, he asked.
''Or the other projects highlighted at the Scottish Chambers of
Commerce Getting Scotland Moving conference last March? Why are such
projects so grudgingly supported? What has happened to the Private
Finance Initiative? Public opinion supporting such schemes could be a
powerful stimulus for action.''
Turning to other changes, he said many pieces of the future industry,
including Railtrack and rolling stock leasing companies, had been
defined and put in place with clear statements of their financial base.
But something was missing, he said. ''How will all this be funded? The
answer can only be by the franchised train operating companies. How will
they provide their funds? It seems that it will be a mixture of revenue
through the fare-box directly from customers and the grant revenue from
the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising for the provision of a
specified service to meet the bills of Railtrack and Roscos.''
He continued: ''We have a model which may have ignored the needs of
the fare paying customers. Certainly most published surveys show public
and customer reluctance to support the change and John Palmer, a man
with long experience as a transport civil servant and now a railwayman,
is reported in a speech to the World Railway Congress as challenging
whether the separation of operations from infrastructure will actually
invigorate railways.''
Mr Warburton said he believed the industry would survive. However, he
left his audience with this thought: ''Let us all hope that for the
railway industry, the present changes are more positive than the advice
offered to readers of Washington Irving's Tales of a Traveller in 1824.
It said, 'There is a certain relief in change, even though it be from
bad to worse -- it is often a comfort to shift one's position and be
bruised in a new place.'
''All change please. This address terminates here.''

A HOTEL worker who sparked off a rescue operation costing #3000 when
he jumped over the side of a cruise boat escaped with a #75 fine
yesterday.
Police, a coastguard cliff rescue team from Ullapool, and the
coastguard rescue helicopter from the other side of the Minch at
Stornoway were all called out in response to Brian Kennely's drunken
prank.
Kennely was among a boatload of holidaymakers on the 70ft Summer Queen
on a two-hour tourist cruise from Ullapool to Isle Martin, near the
Summer Isles.
When the boat was about 100 metres from the island, skipper Kenny
MacKenzie and his passengers were stunned when the fully-clad New
Zealander took a dive over the side and started swimming for the island.
Mr MacKenzie put out an emergency call to the coastguards, but the
college graduate from the Harbour Lights Hotel, Ullapool, made it to the
rocky shore.
He then stood up and waved to everybody back on the Summer Queen.
But, after flying from Stornoway, the coastguard helicopter picked up
police at Ullapool and flew them to uninhabited Isle Martin, where they
arrested Kennely, 27, who was then flown back to Ullapool under escort.
Fiscal David Hingston told Dingwall Sheriff Court that Kennely, who
admitted a breach of the peace, was a first offender and had written a
letter of apology to the police, coastguards and Mr MacKenzie for his
''irresponsible and childish behaviour''.
The fiscal said he had had ''one over the eight'' at the time.
Said a coastguard: ''It was a silly thing for him to do. He could so
easily have got cramp in the cold waters and drowned, particularly when
his body was not functioning normally.''
The cost of the helicopter operation was about #3000.
Kennely afterwards refused to comment on his August evening jape.

ROSEMARY West was abused by her husband Frederick just as he abused
everyone else during his evil life, the jury was told as the defence
case got under way yesterday.
In his opening address, Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, said all he asked of
the jury members was that they showed a willingness to listen to the
other side.
All the evidence they had heard was shocking, some horrific. Other
evidence the jury might think had been irrelevant.
''I will tell you and I will tell you as loudly as I can, Rosemary
West is not guilty on any of the charges,'' Mr Ferguson declared. She
neither knew nor participated in any of the acts which led to the deaths
of these girls. Neither was she involved afterwards in hiding or
concealing these murders.
The jury, Mr Ferguson said, was in court to decide if the Crown had
satisfied them beyond all reasonable doubt of her guilt.
He had no doubt that jury members had heard the views of many people
who had nothing to do with the case.
''The day before this trial commenced I was told by a taxi-man that
the state would be doing a great service if someone put arsenic in
Rosemary West's tea,'' said Mr Ferguson.
''I asked the gentleman if he knew anything about the case and he said
'no'.
''I find that shocking. No doubt you will find it shocking,'' he told
the jury. He had no doubt the jury would be painstaking, fair, and
impartial.
The jury might think it was as plain as a pikestaff that Frederick
West murdered or was party to these murders.
Anne McFall, the Scottish babysitter of Frederick's first wife, Rena,
had gone missing in May 1967 when Rosemary West was 13.
The jury had heard of the disappearance of a Marie Bastholm, in
connection with which no-one had been charged. However, the court had
heard that police had linked it with that of Lucy Partington, one of the
10 victims Mrs West is accused of murdering. Ms Bastholm disappeared in
1968 when Rosemary West was 15.
Mr Ferguson said it was fair to assume Frederick West murdered people
before meeting Rosemary West. He was capable of murder, he was capable
of dismembering and disposing of bodies without Mrs West's knowledge, or
help.
The Crown relied heavily on evidence of sexual bondage. However,
exactly the same sort of articles found in the shallow graves of the
victims at Cromwell Street were found in that of Anne McFall.
The Crown had built a very intelligent, very careful, but very
speculative case, said Mr Ferguson.
The stack of cards on which its case rested was that all victims were
sexually abused and Rosemary West was a necessary ingredient in that
mix. Mr Ferguson disputed the basis for that speculation.
Who lured Anne McFall? he asked. Frederick West was not only capable
but did on occasions try to entice young women into a car on his own.
Mr Ferguson said no-one knew how these unfortunate young girls died.
All that was known was that with the remains were found pieces of tape
and rope.
Their deaths did not necessarily involve sexual violence.
There was no evidence pointing in that direction. Mrs West had been
fined #50 for a sexual assault and causing actual bodily harm to
Caroline Owens, who had given evidence for the prosecution. That was
proof only that Mrs West had committed these crimes on Caroline Owens --
nothing else.
Mr Ferguson said Rosemary West may be a lesbian but that did not make
her a murderess. The fact that she had sex with some of her lodgers did
not make her a murderess.
Evidence of this sort had been introduced by the Crown purely to
excite a degree of prejudice, claimed Mr Ferguson.
Such evidence might offend the jury's moral sensitivities but that did
not make her a murderess.
He said 25 Cromwell Street was not the normal suburban home with 2.4
children.
It was a house full of children, a house with lodgers, a house which
was the refuge for the flotsam and jetsam of modern life. People came
and went without being noticed.
In addition, nobody would be taking notice of Frederick West's
activities in the basement or in the garden and patio. It was not
unusual for him to be building extensions and demolishing. He was after
all a builder and a do-it-yourself enthusiast.
There was no reason for Mrs West to take more notice than anyone else
in the house.
Four key prosecution witnesses -- Caroline Owens, Miss A, Katherine
Halliday, and Anne Marie Davis had had contact with the media and had
been paid or would be paid large sums of money.
Mr Ferguson suggested there was incentive to exaggerate.
''You may think there may have been an element of amateur dramatics in
the way some of them gave their evidence,'' he told the jury.
Miss A, he said, had not complained of an assault for 20 years.
According to her account, she made no attempt to escape from 25
Cromwell Street -- not even when she saw a young girl being sexually
abused before she alleged she was attacked.
That unfortunate woman had been sexually abused by her father and her
brother, and tragically had a psychiatric history.
Katherine Halliday kept going back for more at 25 Cromwell Street.
This indicated that she had not been degraded or humiliated to the
extent she alleged, said Mr Ferguson.
It may be the case that Mrs Davis, having been sexually abused from
the age of eight could not accept that all that had happened to her was
the sole responsibility of the father she adored. It could well be, said
Mr Ferguson, that in her mind she wanted to some degree to spread the
blame by dragging Rosemary West into the assaults.
He made it clear that Mrs West denied ever being party to the sexual
exploitation of that young woman.
Mr Ferguson told the jury that the court had heard Mrs West's reaction
on tape when told Frederick West had admitted murdering their daughter
Heather.
He said they had heard her sobs and how distressed she was during the
police interviews.
He said for the first time she would give her account and what
actually did take place during her years in Cromwell Street.
He told the jury they should bear in mind that, for her, even more so
than for any other witness, this would be a considerable ordeal.
''It is her family, her home, and this is her case,'' Mr Ferguson
declared.

WHEN Frederick West was sent to jail for stealing a tax disc, Mrs
Rosemary West was left alone to look after her two step-children, the
trial was told.
During this time, Charmaine was ''resisting my care'', Mrs West told
the court. Charmaine would generally misbehave, refused to eat, and ran
away.
Asked if she ever disciplined or punished the children, the defendant
told the court only by smacking their bottoms or their legs. She never
stood Charmaine on a chair with her hands tied behind her back or beat
her with a wooden spoon.
West was released from prison in June 1971. By that time, Charmaine
was very destructive and was being very awkward. She would make a fuss,
shout, and throw furniture about.
Mrs West told the court that Charmaine had often said she wanted to
stay with her natural mother and that she felt that would be the best
solution to the problem, and her husband agreed.
West told her it would be best if she was not there when Charmaine's
mother Rena arrived. However, the witness insisted they passed each
other more or less on the doorstep.
Mrs West said she did not return until late that evening, by which
time Charmaine had gone.
The remains of the child, who disappeared when she was eight, were
uncovered at the flat at 25 Midland Road, where the Wests were living at
the time of her disappearance. Her mother's body was found in a field
some distance away.
Mrs West is not accused of Rena's murder.
Mrs West said that, at this time, her husband was encouraging her to
go out with other men. One reason he gave was she was a young girl and
should be enjoying herself.
She recalled coming home earlier than expected from having given birth
to her second daughter Mae, to discover the flat was dirty and
neglected, as were the children.
She went next door to the home of neighbour Elizabeth Agius and, after
some fuss created by her, both her husband and Mrs Agius came out of a
bedroom looking flushed and hassled.
The Wests moved to 25 Cromwell Street. The basement there was a mess,
she said, it was ''rather like a cold, damp cave -- dark, gloomy, and
wet.''
It was in this area the bodies of several other victims were
recovered.
Mrs West said her husband, who carried out all repairs on the house,
would not allow anyone down to this area. At that time, people would say
she was always pregnant, she told the court.
''He would say it is no fit place for a pregnant woman or children,''
she said.
When working in the cellar, Frederick West locked it off from the rest
of the house by bolting a door shut. It was not unusual for him to be in
the basement or digging up floors.
Mrs West told the court she was upset about male lodgers introduced
into 25 Cromwell Street. They moved furniture about and threw mattresses
on the floor. They painted the walls in pychedelic colours -- black,
purple, and green.
They were drop-outs, smoking drugs, and the drug squad regularly
raided the house. Mr West, who spent most of his time with these young
men, thought it was funny.
She told the court he persuaded her to have sex with some of these
lodgers but she insisted it was only as a one-off.
This nightmare period lasted for up to three years, when young girls
replaced the men as lodgers -- 25 Cromwell Street was an open house with
people coming and going at all times.
By August 1973, Mrs West said she and her husband were more or less
living separate lives, passing each other at the door, as one came in
and the other went out.
At times, her husband was very, very good, however, on other occasions
he was the opposite -- very demanding and bloody minded.
One moment he would be in a good mood, then suddenly, when losing
arguments, he would use his fists and hit her. It was a regular
occurence.
Mrs West said, by and large, she had no option but to conform to his
wishes. That included having sex with other men. No money was involved,
except perhaps at Easter and Christmas, or on one of the childrens'
birthdays. Sometimes she was given flowers and chocolates.
Frederick West also suggested that she went out with another girl. She
had recognised at an early age that she was attracted to young girls but
until then had not entertained it as a sexual thought.
Referring to the assault on Caroline Owens, Mrs West insisted that it
was her husband who had suggested that they attempt to pick her up.
Her recollection of the event was very vague.
She had, however, been told by West that Miss Owens would be a willing
partner.
Mrs West said that when she realised that this was not the case, she
wanted it stopped. However, she was terrified by her husband at the
time, very frightened.
She knew she had done wrong and wanted it all to go away. She knew she
had made a mistake.
However, she did not remember Miss Owens being punched by her husband,
nor does she remember her being taped and brought back to 25 Cromwell
Street.
As soon as Caroline had put up resistance ''I stopped'', the witness
said.
In all, it had been a total mess and she realised that she had been
conned by her husband into getting involved in an incident beyond her
control.
''I was as much a victim as Caroline was,'' said Mrs West. She would
never get involved in a relationship where anybody was being forced, she
told the court.
That was as true today as it was then.
Mrs West was shown photographs of various victims.
She recognised only one, Lynda Gough, and only as somebody she passed
on a stair at 25 Cromwell Street.
Mrs West insisted she had never visited Lynda Gough's home, nor had
she met her mother.
''Had you anything to do with the death or disappearance of Lynda
Gough?'' Mr Ferguson asked.
''No, sir.'' Mrs West replied.
Shown pictures of Caroline Cooper, Lucy Partington, Therese
Seigenthaler, Shirley Hubbard, and Juanita Mott, she said she neither
recognised them or had seen them at 25 Cromwell Street.
Mrs West continues her evidence today.

A YOUNG male jury member was discharged yesterday from the Rosemary
West trial. At the outset of yesterday's hearing, Mr Justice Mantell
asked for the jury member, a Mr Gillon, to identify himself. The young
man in the rear row was then told by the judge that something had
happened over the weekend making it necessary to discharge him. It
could, the judge said, be taken under Section 40 of the Criminal Justice
Act or be a matter for his own discrimination. ''You are no longer
required to serve on this jury. You may stand down,'' the judge told
him. The jury now consists of seven men and four women.

SCIENTISTS have discovered a gene which makes the difference between a
sun tan and sunburn, and could help to protect against skin cancer.
The discovery -- by a research team at the department of dermatology
at Newcastle University, aided by Dr Ian Jackson at the MRC Human
Genetics Unit in Edinburgh -- offers a golden future both for sun
worshippers and whoever wins the race to exploit it.
What separates the bronzies from the lobsters on the beach is whether
they produce more of the brownish-black pigment, eumelanin, or the
reddish phaeomelanin.
The key to this is a hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone and
the researchers have found the gene that codes for the receptor for this
hormone. Their discovery will be reported this week in Nature Genetics.
Professor Tony Thody, from Newcastle, suspected that there was
something wrong with the melanocytes in red-haired individuals, and that
it might be picked up at the gene level.
''We have looked at over 100 people -- red-haired at one extreme and
dark-haired at the other -- and it is not just red-haired people who are
affected. We find it in people with brown hair or fair hair.
''We thought we had found the gene for red hair but when we looked at
the data more carefully, we found it was associated with an inability to
tan.''
Professor Thody and his colleagues are now intent on finding how the
gene is inherited and whether it is associated with susceptibility to
skin cancer.
''It may be that we can develop an agent, ideally something that could
be applied through the skin and work its way down into the cell, that
not only helps people to tan but protects them against cancer.

A MAN who robbed shops wearing a red bandana over his face was jailed
for seven years at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
Patrick Murphy, 30, raided four chemists' shops and three hairdressing
salons in the South Side of the city over a six-week period. He twice
raided one of the shops and one of the salons.
Murphy, of Lochleven Road, Battlefield -- dubbed the Bandana Bandit
because of his cowboy-like disguise -- admitted the charges at an
earlier appearance in court.
The Crown accepted pleas of not guilty to several other raids -- at
five chemists, a hairdresser's, and a perfumery during the same period.
The court was told that at the same time as Murphy was involved in the
robberies, he was acting as the press spokesman for the Pollok Free
State protesters campaigning against the building of the M77 at Pollok
estate in Glasgow.
Prosecuting Mr Gerard Moynihan said all the raids except for the final
one were identical. He told the court Murphy threatened counter staff
with a knife and ordered them to hand over the cash. On one raid, he
stole a customer's handbag, and in another, robbed a customer of five
gold bangles valued at #5000.
Defending, Mr Murray McAra, solicitor advocate, claimed Murphy was a
heroin addict who owed a large sum of money to drug suppliers who had
threatened him with violence.
Mr McAra told the court that police investigating the raids had dubbed
the culprit the Bandana Bandit, and after Murphy was arrested he had
given the red bandana to detectives before taking them on a tour of the
premises he had robbed.
Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson QC told him the charges were so
grave they required a long sentence to protect the public.

THREE doctors involved in an article allegedly identifying a bulimia
sufferer with a history of self-mutilation were accused of serious
professional misconduct yesterday.
Dr John Eagles and Dr Alistair Palin, of the Royal Cornhill Hospital,
Aberdeen, and former colleague Dr Jon Parkin, are accused before the
General Medical Council of serious breaches of confidentiality in an
article in the Journal of Psychiatry.
The article is said to have identified patient Ms C, a 26-year-old
pre-registration doctor said to have drained her own blood in a bid to
lose weight.
Counsel for Ms C, Miss Rosalind Foster, said the thrust of the case
''was the very principle of confidentiality and consent'' and the
absolute need for patients' anonymity to be preserved.
Dr Eagles, of Binghill Park, Milltimber, Aberdeen, admits submitting a
paper on ''bloodletting in bulimia nervosa'' which was published in the
journal in February 1993.
Dr Parkin, now registered as of Noel Road, Islington, North London,
makes similar admissions.
However, they both deny disclosing information relating to Ms C
without first obtaining from her informed consent or without satisfying
themselves that it had been obtained.
They also denied the information in the paper enabled Ms C to be
identified.
Dr Palin, whose address was given as the Royal Cornhill Hospital,
Cornhill Road, Aberdeen, admits he was a consultant psychiatrist
responsible for the care of Ms C when she attended as an in-patient and
as a day patient in August 1990 and January 1992.
He denies providing information to the other two doctors, knowing that
it was to be used by them in preparing a paper for the journal,
providing the information without Ms C's consent, and enabling
information to be contained in the paper, such that it enabled Ms C to
be identified.
The journal article contained detailed information which clearly
identified Ms C -- ''not least to herself'', said Miss Foster.
It referred to her age, the fact she was a pre-registration doctor
with a history of self harm, and suffering from an eating disorder from
the age of 16.
Further, her weight and height were given, a diagnosis of macular
degeneration, a history of blood-letting and self harm, together with
the drugs she had been given to combat the problem.
A friend of Ms C, who had read an article based on that in the journal
in the Aberdeen Press and Journal, had instantly recognised her
identity.
She had shown the article to Ms C, causing her ''hurt and harm''.
Miss Foster said the question of consent -- and whether Ms C was
capable of giving it -- was also crucial to the case.
General Medical Council guidelines, and guidelines on consent in the
British Journal of Psychiatry, had stressed the importance of consent.
It was true to say that some of the material had been published after
the submission of the article by the doctors, but this had been merely
restating or qualifying ''a long accepted and absolutely fundamental
aspect'' of the importance of a relationship with trust, and the fact
that it should not be abused.
Miss Foster added: ''The committee may query whether she could have
given an informed consent.
''At the very least, the doctors should have asked her to sign a
consent form. This is all the more important with a weak and vulnerable
patient like Ms C.''
Miss Foster said that, whatever the position was about confidence and
consent, the doctors were under an obligation to preserve Ms C's
anonymity.
Details in the article, especially in a small community like Aberdeen,
were bound to identify her. Indeed, Ms C ''must be well-nigh unique'' in
Aberdeen.
The hearing continues.

FRANCE has agreed to share with Britain research from its nuclear
testing in the South Pacific.
The announcement by President Jacques Chirac came at the close of two
days of meetings marked by continuous protests from anti-nuclear
demonstrators.
Concluding their first summit, Mr Chirac and Mr Major marked the
strengthening relationship between their two countries with measures
designed to promote nuclear co-operation and close collaboration against
international terrorism.
Mr Major also reasserted Britain's refusal to be pressed into joining
a European single currency, only minutes after Mr Chirac, standing
beside him, had praised monetary union and dismissed Euro-scepticism as
''a fad''.
However, the two leaders agreed on the clear improvement in relations
since Mr Chirac's election in May, and by their remarks confirmed that
the Franco-German axis will no longer dominate European negotiations.
With hundreds of anti-nuclear protesters crowding the pavements across
Whitehall from the Foreign Office, Mr Major also repeated his support
for Mr Chirac's decision to resume French nuclear testing.
Their joint declaration said: ''We have decided to pursue and deepen
nuclear co-operation between our two countries. Our aim is mutually to
strengthen deterrence, while retaining the independence of our nuclear
forces.''
The Franco-British Joint Nuclear Commission will examine ways of
sharing information from France's nuclear tests, the latest of which
took place at Mururoa in the South Pacific on Friday, and which are due
to be completed next spring. Britain is unable to carry out tests
because it uses the American site, and the US has ceased testing.
At a news conference after their final meeting, Mr Major repeated
Britain's ''wait and see'' policy on a single currency. The issue should
be looked at realistically, when it arose, ''with a clear and open mind
and decide what is necessary and most appropriate to the British
interest and European interest,'' he said.
He added: ''As for monetary union, the British position is well known.
It has not changed since I set it out clearly in the Maastricht
negotiations, when I obtained for Britain the right to opt out of a
single European currency.''
Mr Chirac defended France's determination to join the single currency,
and promised his country would satisfy the economic conditions required
by the Maastricht Treaty for monetary union to take place in 1999.
On nuclear tests, Mr Major said it would have been difficult for Mr
Chirac to ignore the scientific advice he received on the need to test
France's independent deterrent. ''Frankly, I believe that he had no
choice. On that basis I offered my support.''
Mr Chirac praised the warming of Franco-British relations which had
become strained under Mrs Thatcher and President Mitterrand.
He said: ''There is a sort of natural facility to speak of everything
with frankness, of what unites us, of what might separate us. I am very
struck by this evolution, that ceaselessly reasserts itself.''
He dismissed Euro-scepticism as ''a fad'' that existed in all member
states of the EU. Progress continued in European construction, he said,
and France and Britain now dealt realistically with each other. ''We are
pragmatists, we move to our rhythm, in a positive fashion without
misunderstanding between us,'' he said.
Asked about suggestions that the previously close relationship between
France and Germany has cooled since he took office, Mr Chirac said:
''France and Germany's friendship is inscribed in our destinies. Being
two countries in the heart of Europe, it's obvious that Europe will make
itself only if there is Franco-German accord. If there isn't, there will
be no Europe.''
However, he added: ''Europe is not only France and Germany. Europe is
other countries, in the front rank of which is the UK with its
originality, its history, its traditions, which cannot be on the
margins. If the Franco-German relationship is necessary, it is not
sufficient.''
The two leaders also issued a declaration of shared national
interests. It states: ''We do not see situations arising in which the
vital interests of either France or the UK could be threatened without
the vital interests of the other also being threatened.''
Mr Chirac explained that this was a reaffirmation of a long-standing
understanding between the two countries. Mr Major added: ''We thought it
appropriate to make that point crystal clear on this occasion.''
Earlier, they inaugurated the new Franco-British Euro Air Group, aimed
at co-ordinating French and British air forces in humanitarian and
peace-keeping operations. They revealed that Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo is in discussion with his French counterpart, Mr Charles
Millon, to determine new areas of co-operation.

MOTORISTS could face paying tolls on three more bridges in the
Highlands if the new area local authority fails to persuade the Scottish
Office to abolish or significantly reduce tolls on the Skye bridge.
The tolls could be reduced to #1 and the #25m structure paid off in
just three years but only if other residents of Highland region also pay
tolls, Lochalsh councillor John Farquhar Munro said yesterday. He
suggested 50p on Highland bridges and a further 10p on the Forth,
Erskine, and Tay bridges.
If 50p is too much, a 10p toll on the Kessock, Cromarty, Dornoch,
Ballachulish, and Kylesku bridges, with the same increase on the three
other existing toll bridges, would mean the Skye bridge was paid for in
six years, he said. It is currently expected to take 16 to 27 years.
Mr Munro, who last week was elected chairman of the new single-tier
Highland Council's transport committee, said that if the Scottish Office
could not be persuaded, consideration would have to be given to using
other bridges to help reduce the tolls on the Skye bridge. All other
bridges in the Highlands are toll-free.
Mr Munro says #10.56m could be raised, sufficient to build and operate
toll booths on the Highland bridges and pay off the Skye bridge within
three years.
Mr Tony MacKay, founding director of MacKay Consultants, who first
proposed the Skye toll bridge in 1984, said last night: ''The figures
are fair enough and it wouldn't cost much to build and operate toll
barriers but I don't think it would ever be accepted.''
Mr Munro, however, did not dismiss the idea.
He said: ''Our priority is to try to persuade the Scottish Office to
abolish or reduce significantly the toll burden on the Skye bridge,
hopefully with the backing of the new Highland Council. If that fails,
then we should perhaps look at some scheme like this.''

MORE than 50 jobs are likely to become available at the HCI hospital
in Clydebank following a major deal signed yesterday with one of
Algeria's main health insurers.
The agreement, which is worth several million pounds, is expected to
bring 200-300 patients from Algeria to Clydebank over the twelve months
from December for heart bypass operations and cancer treatment.
The agreement with CNAS -- the National Social Insurance Fund for
Salaried Workers -- also entails a continuing education programme for
medical, paramedical, and senior personnel from Algeria to gain
practical experience and observe complex surgical procedures at
Clydebank.
HCI clinical staff will also travel regularly to Algeria to provide
medical care, subject to the advice of the Government, a hospital
spokesman said.
Partly as a result of the deal and partly because of other
developments, HCI is to bring a further 42 beds into use in addition to
the 60 it has in operation.
This is still some way short of the total capacity of 260 beds
available to HCI but Mr Edward Burk, the director of finance and
operations, said they were currently in discussions with a number of
foreign governments about establishing similar relationships to the one
agreed with CNAS.
He said: ''Such a major international contract is a fitting testament
to the quality of this facility and all of the staff who work here. Our
reputation as a centre of excellence is spreading and we are confident
we can attract much more work of this calibre to Clydebank.''
The workforce at HCI currently numbers 450, having risen by 70 since
the hospital was bought out of receivership by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Trust in February, and a mixture of clinical and non-clinical
appointments is expected to take it to well over 500. A hospital
spokesman said patients from Abu Dhabi were starting to come over in
reasonable numbers.

THE grim reality of life for families forced to live beside violent or
intimidating neighbours was sketched out for MPs on the all-party
Scottish Affairs Committee yesterday.
Many people are afraid to come forward and give evidence in court, the
committee was told, and even where eviction proceedings have been
started, they may be subject to inordinate delays, while complainers
continue to live side by side with those they have complained against.
''The potential for intimidation is there for everyone to see,'' Mr
David Comley, Glasgow's director of housing, said. ''It is often the
case that, when we get to court, there are no witnesses at all.''
In a stark indictment of the present system the directors of housing
for Glasgow, Dundee, and Inverness district councils claimed the
criminal justice process was failing people who have to live with
anti-social neighbours, and called for a radical shake-up of the system.
Among the measures they proposed are:
* Housing courts or housing tribunals to provide a streamlined system:
* A review of the criminal justice system to provide more effective
and rapid methods of dealing with disruptive families:
* More effective witness protection.
It is estimated, however, that of the 20,000 eviction cases dealt with
in Scotland every year, only 5% are prompted by anti-social tenants, and
Glasgow District Council evicted only six tenants for that reason last
year.
The committee is taking evidence on Scottish Office proposals to
introduce a one-year probationary period for new tenants. The measures,
which have been attacked by housing campaigners and tenants' groups as
leading to a loss of rights and greater insecurity, were criticised by
the directors.
Mr Comley said: ''My council's opposition is that the measures would
not be effective. I simply can't see that a 12-month probationary
period, which would still require that you go to court, adds anything.''
Mr Peter Loutit, Inverness District Council's director of housing,
added: ''You would be stigmatising all tenants. The fact is that less
than 5% of tenants are anti-social.''
Mr Loutit, in his written submission, emphasised that courts do not
provide a suitable environment for trying housing cases.
''Quite apart from being completely overloaded, the setting is in
itself intimidating for witnesses, who have often never been in court in
their lives,'' he said.
''All the trappings of wigs, black gowns, witness boxes, no notes to
assist, a sheriff gazing out from on high is simply frightening.''
Mr Loutit said ''user friendly'' housing courts, with real expertise
in housing matters, could ease the enormous logjam of cases.
There were also concerns expressed that housing managers are being
expected to deal with problems not within their professional remit. One
of the recommendations made by Mr Russell Rowbotham, director of housing
at Dundee District Council, was that a partnership be set up between the
various agencies to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.
Mr Rowbotham said the criminal justice system was not dealing
effectively with crime and anti-social behaviour and that residents have
increasingly been calling on landlords to take eviction action against
tenants for criminal offences.
He outlined a case involving a Dundee family who had 120 convictions
in the year prior to their eviction case, but were still living at the
address.
''This amply demonstrates the fact that the whole family were engaged
in criminal activities in the area,'' he said. ''They had been charged
and dealt with repeatedly by the system, but were still at large in the
streets.''
Mr David Marshall, Labour MP for Glasgow Shettleston, asked if it was
the case that the incidence of anti-social behaviour had increased
substantially in the last five years.
He was told by Mr Comley that, although statistics on the subject did
not stretch back far enough to prove the point, he felt that that was
the case.
''It does seem to me that certain crimes of behaviour have certainly
become worse over the last 20 years. One is drug behaviour which simply
didn't exist in the scale it does now even I first started working in
Glasgow in the 80s.''

MRS Rosemary West took the witness box yesterday for the first time,
and swore she had not been involved in the abduction and killings of
young girls and women nor the disposal of their bodies.
She had fallen for the lies of her husband Frederick, she told the
jury. He had promised to love her and care for her and she had believed
him. ''He promised me the world,'' she said.
''I was vulnerable to his pressures and powers,'' she told Winchester
Crown Court, which heard her speak of how she was raped as a youngster.
With tears welling behind her spectacles, she said she was just as
much a victim of Fred West as Caroline Owens, who has told the court
that both Wests were convicted of sexually assaulting her and causing
actual bodily harm in 1972.
Mrs West said it was her husband, Frederick, who was the instigator of
that attack. From the witness box she said she had never seen that side
of his character before the assault. ''I have never seen it since
either,'' she told Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending.
Mrs West denies the murder of 10 people, including her daughter
Heather and Scottish-born step-daughter Charmaine, who disappeared when
aged eight.
She said she had been raped on two separate occasions when aged 15 and
before she had met Frederick West. On one of these occasions she had
feared for her life.
Her early years had been blighted after she was abandoned by her
mother for a spell following a row between her parents which led to a
family break-up. ''All I ever wanted in my life was my family,'' said
Mrs West.
She sat as she gave her evidence and peered underneath the four
microphones towards defence counsel.
Fred West, she said, was persuasive, intimidating and used emotional
blackmail. He could charm the birds out of the trees.
After the Caroline Owens incident, Mrs West said she wanted to leave
him. The children were in the pram at the door, but she had nowhere to
go. ''Who would keep me?'' she asked. ''Where would the money come
from?''
She was persuaded by Fred West to stay with him at 25 Cromwell Street
on the promise that nothing like that would ever happen again.
She admitted her husband had forced her to sleep with other men --
some of whose children she subsequently bore with his knowledge -- but
insisted she knew nothing of the deaths of young girls and women at
Cromwell Street.
Born in Devon, Mrs West, now aged 42, told the court she first had
sexual intercourse when aged 14. She had a few boyfriends then. By that
time the family was living at Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucester.
She said that after a Christmas party, just before her 15th birthday,
a man drove her into the hills beyond her home where he raped her. She
thought he was going to kill her. She did not tell anyone.
Shortly afterwards the family broke up and she and her mother and two
young brothers went to live with her elder sister, Glenys, in
Cheltenham. By this time she had a job.
Returning from work one day, she found her mother and brother had
moved on.
''It had a devastating effect on me. She just left me . . . abandoned
me.'' Shortly after Mrs West, then aged 15, said she went to live with a
male friend of her sister. He was then about 30 years of age. They had a
sexual relationship.
Her family was reunited at Bishop's Cleeve and she worked at a baker's
shop.
She described how, returning from work, she was attacked by another
man, dragged into a park at Cheltenham and raped. Again she told no-one.
After that assault, she caught transport home from the main bus
station at Cheltenham. It was there she met Frederick West.
On their first date he brought a present of a fur coat and a lace
dress. She said she could not take that home, as her parents would
disapprove. Mr West kept the presents in his caravan.
He told her he was separated from his wife and was looking after two
young children: Charmaine and Ann Marie. Days later she met them.
''I loved them straight away, sir,'' she told Mr Ferguson. She felt
sorry because they never had their mother around and she wanted to look
after them.
She tidied up the caravan and babysat and began a sexual relationship
with Fred West. However, it was the children who really attracted her.
She described how she became pregnant with her daughter, Heather, one
of her alleged victims. At the time she was living with her parents.
Their attitude was ''shock horror'', Mrs West said.
Her father tried to put a stop to the relationship. Eventually she was
placed in a children's home.
Her parents agreed she could leave a few weeks later, on condition
that she had nothing further to do with Fred West and had an abortion.
Mrs West said she was nursing old wounds -- especially how she had
been abandoned briefly by her mother during the family break-up -- and
believed Fred West's lies that he would look after her.
She went to live with him shortly before an ambulance was due to
arrive to take her to hospital for the abortion.
Her father had told her she had two options: she could go through with
the operation and stay with the family, or go and live with Fred West
and be disowned.
If he ever saw them in the streets ''he would knife us,'' Mrs West
said she was told.
To her that was no ultimatum. She loved Charmaine and Ann Marie and
wanted her baby, so she left home.

THE two crewmen from an RAF Tornado fighter were rescued last night
after baling out following an apparent mid-air collision with another
Tornado.
The Tornado F3 crashed into the sea 60 miles north east of Berwick and
the two were picked up by an RAF search and rescue helicopter, the
Ministry of Defence said.
They were taken to hospital in Dundee. Each plane has a pilot and
navigator.
The Tornado, based at RAF Leuchars, crashed into the sea shortly
before 8pm.
Another Tornado returned to Leuchars with external damage and it was
assumed they had collided.
The aircrew in the other Tornado were unharmed.
An RAF spokesman said: ''This would have been a high-speed impact, so
they have certainly had an extremely lucky escape. It would appear they
had little time to react.''
Both men had managed to eject successfully from the aircraft and were
found in their ejector seats by rescuers. The seats are fitted with
emergency survival bags and both pilots were wearing lifejackets.
Both #25m aircraft were taking part in a regular joint maritime and
air exercise with the Royal Navy, involving a number of aircraft and
ships.
After the crewmen ditched, a huge rescue operation was launched.
Rescue helicopters from RAF Boulmer and RAF Lossiemouth searched the
scene for nearly an hour and a Nimrod aircraft from RAF Kinloss assisted
along with the container ship, Helgafel.
Shortly before 10pm, a spokesman at the RAF rescue co-ordination
centre at Pitreavie confirmed the Boulmer helicopter had picked up the
two men alive.
He said both were flown to Ninewells hospital, from where it is
understood they were transferred by ambulance to Dundee Royal Infirmary.
It was understood both were conscious when rescued but were suffering
from the effects of being in the icy sea.
A spokesman at Dundee Royal said both were in a ''stable'' condition
and would be detained overnight for observation.
The RAF spokesman confirmed that the Tornado wreckage had not been
spotted and it was not yet known if attempts will be made to recover it
from the seabed.
A full investigation is expected to be held.
Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) said: ''This is
the kind of crash which many people fear will happen over land.
''In an area where we have a great deal of low flying there will be
anxiety. We will want questions answered about how it happened.''
The crash is the second involving a Tornado over the North Sea this
year.
In March, a crewman was killed and the other ejected safely when an F3
from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, crashed during a training exercise off
Humberside.
Last year there were five Tornado crashes. One of the worst was just
over a year ago when both crew were killed when a GR1 based in Norfolk
crashed into a Perthshire hillside during a low-flying exercise. The
navigator came from Ayrshire.

A SON of former world champion boxer Jim Watt was believed to have
been involved in a road accident last night in which one person died.
Police could not confirm early this morning if the fatality was the
boxer's son.
No one was available for comment at the Watt's family home in
Kirkintilloch.
Two other people, one male and one female, were also injured in the
two-car crash, which happened around 10pm at Kilsyth Road at
Kirkintilloch. They were taken to Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital with what
were believed to be minor injuries.
Jim Watt, who now runs a wedding car hire business from his home,
became world lightweight boxing champion in April 1979 after beating
Colombian Alfredo Pitalua.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Fire Brigade said crews had spent more
than an hour clearing debris. She said: ''The persons involved were
released prior to the arrival of the fire brigade and we assisted in
clearing the roadway.''
The road was closed for more than an hour as emergency service
officers worked at the scene.
Police, who were still at the scene early this morning, said they were
attempting to trace witnesses to the accident.

SEPARATISTS held a narrow lead of 51.8% in Quebec's independence
referendum in the early results, CBC television said this morning.
The voters who want the French-speaking province to secede from Canada
had taken an even stronger strong lead in the first returns, but this
was eroded as votes came in from larger cities which have have opposed
independence.
After the early results, the Canadian dollar plunged nearly a cent
against the US dollar.
