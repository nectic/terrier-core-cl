A DRINK driver walked away from a court scot free yesterday after an
official blunder meant he could not be sentenced.
Electrician Richard Thomson, 21, was told by Sheriff Robert Younger at
Stirling Sheriff Court that he could not be sentenced for his offence
because of a legal technicality.
The court was told that the the procurator-fiscal's office at Stirling
had failed to attach a ''notice of penalty'' to the summons sent to
Thomson, of New Road, Bannockburn.
Sheriff Younger told the astonished driver: ''There's been a technical
difficulty. You haven't had a notice telling you of the penalty you
face, and in that situation the court can't sentence you -- so that'll
be the end of it.''
Thomson had pleaded guilty to driving a car on a campus road at
Stirling University while over the alcohol limit.
His solicitor-advocate, Mr George Pollock, said afterwards that the
offence would stand on Thomson's record as a conviction, but under Scots
law he could not be sentenced for it.
As Thomson left the court, he said: ''I'm glad I got off.''
Asked whether he felt guilty at not being banned, he replied: ''The
fiscal made a mistake, and that's it.''
There was no comment from the fiscal's office, but co-chair of the
Scottish Campaign Against Irresponsible Drivers, Wendy Moss, called for
an immediate inquiry into the case.
She added: ''The police must be heartily sick, because they spend a
lot of time and trouble clamping down on drink driving only to see
people get off like this.''

THE opening salvoes in the charm offensive by new Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth have failed to win any new territory, according to the
latest System Three poll for The Herald, which shows the Tories slipping
to fourth place.
In spite of the high profile of Mr Forsyth's early days in charge at
St Andrew's House and his promises to make Government more accountable,
his party remains trapped on 11% for the third successive month,
allowing opponents to claim he had failed to benefit from a honeymoon
period.
With Labour slipping back three points to 54%, and the SNP down one on
22%, the poll shows an upturn in support for the Liberal Democrats, from
8% to 12%.
This appears to have come on the back of their victory in last month's
by-election at Littleborough and Saddleworth, in the North of England,
where they held off a strong challenge from Labour to win the Tory seat.
The poll was conducted among 1028 voters in 39 constituencies between
July 27 and August 1, and the results exclude the 19% who had not
decided, would not say, or did not know how they would vote in a General
Election.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the poll was a
welcome boost which reflected their by-election result. ''We campaigned
for extra investment in education, against rail privatisation, and for
democratic reform of the constitution,'' he said.
''These are issues which people in Scotland also feel strongly
about.''
On the implications of the Conservatives' slide to fourth place, he
said: ''Michael Forsyth's supposed revitalisation of the Scots Tories
has come to nothing. His hysterical attacks on the idea of a Scottish
parliament have only confirmed to the Scottish people how out of touch
he is.''
Not since June of last year have the Conservatives found themselves
lying in fourth place in a Herald poll. Yesterday, they suggested that
the latest poll had come too soon to allow the new Secretary of State to
make an impact.
Deputy chairman Annabel Goldie said: ''I believe the overall message
must be that there is still all to play for in Scottish politics and I
look forward to seeing the impact on future polls as Mr Forsyth and his
team continue to set the political agenda.''
Labour professed itself happy in spite of slipping three points,
pointing out that its standing in Scotland had been at more than 50% for
nine consecutive months.
''Our consistent defence of Scotland against this Government continues
to be shown as popular with the people,'' said general secretary Jack
McConnell. ''Tony Blair is in touch with the aspirations of Scots,
Michael Forsyth has made no impact as Secretary of State.''
SNP Chief executive Michael Russell said the poll was a ''devastating
blow to Michael Forsyth and the Tory Party.''

AYRSHIRE MPs are to seek an early meeting with British Aerospace chief
executive Dick Evans to discuss speculation about the company's
Jetstream plant at Prestwick.
The move follows reports that the future of the plant, which employs
almost 2000, may be in doubt because of a joint venture deal being
sought with China to make regional jet airliners.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said he
and his Ayrshire colleagues had been given assurances over the future of
the factory.
He said: ''These reports caused widespread alarm and I must say that
the company has moved swiftly to dispel any rumours and give
assurances.''
Jetstream recently joined the Franco-Italian company ATR in a joint
venture to market and sell a wide range of turboprop airliners,
including the Prestwick-built 29-seat Jetstream 41.

THE Ministry of Agriculture has received tenders from 12 organisations
prepared to undertake a study into the possible chronic effects on
farmers of using organophosphorous sheep dips.
Angela Browning, Parliamentary secretary at the ministry, said she
also planned to commission a study on alternatives to chemicals in the
management of ectoparasites on sheep, and work on immunological
approaches to the control of sheep scab.
Welcoming the progress which had been made towards awarding a contract
for epidemiological research into the use of OP dips, Mrs Browning said
she hoped to announce the outcome of the tendering process as soon as
possible.
The study into the effects on farmers will be funded jointly by the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Health and the Health and
Safety Executive. The research is expected to take three or four years.
While there has been pressure from some quarters for a ban on OP dips,
the Government has accepted the advice of the Veterinary Products
Committee that their marketing and use should continue while an
evaluation is made on the possible effects on human beings.
Farmers who plan to use OP dips must now undergo training and are also
required to wear protective clothing.
A report published in May by the Institute of Occupational Health,
representing the culmination of three years work on behalf of the Health
and Safety Executive, claimed to have found that OP dips had subtle
chronic effects on the nervous system.
The results were based on a controlled study comparing the physical
and psychological condition of 146 sheep workers and 142 quarry workers.
The report stopped short of calling for a ban on OP dips but suggested
that further efforts should be made to reduce exposure by identifying
the most appropriate protective clothing and dipping equipment, and
encouraging their use.
A monthly review of agricultural and rural law -- Farm Law -- has
suggested that acknowledgement of a direct link between the use of OP
dips and illnesses complained of by farmers and farm workers could lead
to substantial claims for damages against the Government and OP
manufacturers.
Liberal-Democrat agriculture spokeman Paul Tyler is leading a group of
MPs who share his concern over possible side effects from use of the
dips.
''The ministry cannot allow itself to be put into a position where
every sheep farmer who has a headache could make a claim for
compensation,'' Farm Law said.
''The symptoms are often non-specific (severe anxiety, depression and
impulsive suicidal tendencies) and where, for example, ME or
motor-neurone disease occurs, the gradual nature of the onset of the
disease and the time lag since the last occasion on which the patient
used OP make a causal link hard to establish.''

JIM Telfer, the Scottish Rugby Union's director of rugby is to take on
the new role of national coaching director and chairman of selectors,
confirming him as the overall supremo of Scottish rugby.
Telfer's new role supercedes and augments that of team manager Duncan
Paterson, who retired after the World Cup in June. The decision not to
appoint another manager as the direct successor to Paterson is in line
with current SRU thinking, which calls for commercial and marketing
aspects of the national side to be dealt with by the Murrayfield
administrative apparatus.
Telfer, a former Scottish captain, who coached the 1983 British Lions
and Scotland's 1984 Grand Slam side, and who also was involved in a
subsidiary coaching role with the 1990 Grand Slam side, will work
alongside Richie Dixon, who moves up from last season's assistant
coaching berth to become the senior coach, and former international
centre David Johnston, who is promoted after a successful spell in
charge of the A side.
The changes end speculation that the managerial position would become
a paid one. Effectively, it has. But with Telfer's appointment, the
re-worked post goes to someone already on the Murrayfield payroll.
It was also announced yesterday that Douglas Morgan, who retired as
coach after the World Cup, takes over as manager of the A side with
ex-Scotland, Hawick, and Boroughmuir player Graham Hogg -- who has
successfully coached Currie and Edinburgh -- replacing Johnston as coach
of the shadow side.
Yesterday, Paterson -- in his new role as convener of the SRU rugby
section -- explained the reasoning behind the decision to widen Telfer's
responsibilities: ''The feeling is that we would like to see team
managments at all levels concentrating more on the rugby side. We have
seen a big commercial increase in the last two years and we would like
to take responsibility for the commercial side away from the national
squads.
''We believe that the job which Jim is now being asked to do
complements his job as director of rugby. We would hope the appointment
would take us through to the next World Cup but the situation will be
reviewed after a year.
Paterson said that Telfer would have overall responsibility for the
playing strategy of the national side in addition to responsibility for
discipline, technical and medical back-up, and he would be ''quality
controller'' on the practice field.
Telfer said:''I see the new set-up as being a triumverate of coaches,
with most, if not all of the coaching being done by Richie in the
forwards and David in the backs. I would be involved in quality control.
''I would like to think that the three coaches will all have opinions,
and at the end of the day, it will come down to a consensus. That may
sound like a cop-out, but Scotland do play rugby in a distinctive
fashion and Richie, David and I complement each other well.''
A three-way coaching set-up with Telfer in prime position over
Johnston and Dixon -- who has worked doggedly in the background under
Dougie Morgan -- has the potential to lead to conflict. However, Telfer
considered that any problems which arose could be easily overcome. ''It
is up to us make to make sure that the system works.''
All team management appointments announced by Murrayfield yesterday:-
Scotland: National coaching director and chairman of selectors - J W
Telfer; Coaches - J R Dixon, D I Johnston; Other selectors - A B Hastie
and C D Fisher.
Scotland A: Convener - K I Crichton; Manager and chairman of selectors
- D W Morgan; Coaches - C G Hogg and H Campbell; Other selector - I T

CELTIC yesterday signed Scottish football's Mr Motivator and then got
down to further negotiations with Falkirk to determine how much he is
worth.
John Hughes, a 30-year-old defender with a ferocious will-to-win that
matches anything available in the country, revelled in the spotlight
that shone on him from TV lights and media fascination as befitting a
man who had long ago accepted that his career would be played out in the
chorus rather than at the front of the stage.
Hughes was not terribly interested in the financial details of his
move to Parkhead, but his club's chairman, George Fulston, who had just
lost his manager, Jim Jefferies, to Hearts and is to lose the assistant,
Billy Brown, naturally was particularly concerned about the details
involved in transferring his captain during what could be termed his
summer of discontent.
The two clubs were a long way apart in valuation, but they are
expected to get together and sort it out within the next 24 hours.
Although I understand that Falkirk originally had asked for #1m, with
Celtic more inclined to offer a quarter of that sum, the end product
might well be in the #350,000 region.
Whatever the fee, no man who has been transferred anywhere in the
close season is more thrilled than Hughes, nicknamed 'Yogi' just like
the former Celtic hero, John Hughes, a winger of some excellent
eccentricity of the sixties.
''I am still in a daze,'' said Hughes. ''On Friday night, when I first
heard about this, I was floating. It has been unbelievable since, with
people wishing me all the best and the phone never stopping. What Celtic
can expect from me is no frills and 100 per cent every time.''
Hughes pointed out that he is still a relative learner in the
business, having come through the apprenticeship as a junior with
Newtongrange Star, at which time he was a painter and decorator, before
becoming a professional at 23 with Berwick Rangers, then Swansea and
Falkirk for the past five years.
''I was a Celtic fan when I was a kid,'' he said, ''and my dad has
always been a Celtic man. He was very emotional when I told him what was
happening, but I just wish my mum had been alive to see this day.''
Hughes does not pay too much attention to his age which, in football
terms, might be considered in the veteran stage, not just because of his
late arrival on the pro scene.
''The way I am feeling about this move I am a 20-year-old. Tommy Burns
has told me he does not expect any different from me than I have been
doing with Falkirk, but when he asked me if I was interested in joining
Celtic I could have bitten his arm off.''
He may be coming from a different aspect than such as Andreas Thom,
the man signed for #2.2m, but at one level at least he will not be found
wanting. Hughes will exert his all for his new club, and then some. ''I
feel like a boxer going into an #8m boxing match. And I haven't lost
many.''
He acknowledges that Rangers ''maybe got their house in order
quicker,'' but adds with an outsize grin: ''Now I am here Celtic have
got their house in order. I am the type of player who just hates geting
beaten. My wife is inclined to put on the helmet when I come home on a
Saturday night after losing.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns admitted that he and his cohorts have been
impressed by Hughes every time they have seen or come up against him.
''He is a leader and that is why we have signed him.''

* PLAYERS' union chief Gordon Taylor has appealed to Andrei
Kanchelskis to let him help sort out the #5m transfer tug-of-war between
Everton and Manchester United.
United yesterday called off the winger's move after a wrangle over who
pays 30% of any sell-on fee, a clause in the contract which brought
Kanchelskis from Ukrainian club Donetsk to Old Trafford.
Everton, having already agreed to hand over #750,000 to the player as
part of the deal, are unwilling to dig even deeper to help United pay
off around #1.1m to Donetsk.

Gothenburg,
TWO consecutive leaps of faith by Jonathan Edwards yesterday brought
him sporting immortality and gold at the World Championships.
The Devon vicar's son, who used to avoid triple jumping on Sundays
because of religious convictions, twice shattered the world record - the
first legal 18.00m jump, and the first over 60 feet. His winning margin
was the widest since the inaugural 1896 Olympics, which was won with a
dinky 13.71m.
With his first attempt, the 29-year old Edwards increased his own
world record by 18cms to 18.16m, yet he barely hit the take-off board.
It was the equivalent of racing at a football pitch's 18-yard line,
and with a hop, step, and a jump, ending up in the back of the net.
He knew, instantly, that he had achieved his goal, leaping from the
pit and punching the air.
But having been denied the 18m mark four times this summer by illegal
wind assistance, Edwards' first glance was to the wind guage, where the
figure, 1.3, indicated it was within the permitted limit of 2.00m per
second.
This effort effectively ended the contest, but just to ensure the
message was absorbed by the reigning champion, American Mike Conley,
Edwards again powered down the runway, extending his winning margin to
18.29m on his second attempt. It was almost as though he reached this
precise distance to order, and again it was legal.
In the USA, metric measurement is still disdained. But every triple
jumper knows what 18.29 is -- 60 feet and a quarter inch -- beating the
event's ultimate barrier. It was the first time a world jumps record had
been beaten on successive attempts.
Edwards so destroyed the composure of Cuban title-contender Yoelvis
Quesada that he produced four successive no-jumps, failing to get a
medal. Conley could manage no better than seventh, and James Beckford,
fifth on the world all-time list, was sixth.
World indoor champion Brian Wellman (Bermuda) held himself together
best, second with 17.62. Third was Jerome Romaine (Dominica) with 17.59
-- his country's first international medal.
Wellman pleaded with Edwards after his initial record: ''Don't do that
again -- I need to get a jump in.'' Edwards paid no attention, yet took
only three of the six permitted jumps. World records in grand prix
meetings carry substantial bonuses, but here, the Mercedes car for
victory was already assured.
Edwards is entitled to any rewards he can store up. After he had won
the European Cup with a windy 18.43m in Lille -- the longest jump ever
-- there were attempts to re-negotiate his appearance fee for UK
meetings this year. But BAF refused to do so.
Edwards is the first Briton to win a World or Olympic jumps crown with
a world best since Tim Ahearne, at the 1908 Olympics.
He is the ninth British winner of a world title since these
championships were inaugurated in 1983. The last Briton to win a World
or Olympic title with a world record was decathlete Daley Thompson, in
the 1984 Olympics.
A physics graduate, and genetic researcher by profession until he gave
up to jump full time, he is the most delightful, self-effacing of men.
He described his jump as ''a humbling experience. I have found nothing
in science ever to confound my belief in the existence of God,'' he once
told me.
''Sometimes I lie awake, and wonder, am I doing anything worthwhile
here? The pointlessness of it. You see doctors in Rwanda. They are
making a difference, but I jump into a sandpit for a living. Who
benefits from that?''
When Edwards was refusing to compete on the Sabbath -- he missed the
1991 world championships, upholding his principle -- a friend described
a dream to him. It involved the crowd on a jump runway, clearing to
allow Edwards to run through. ''I interpreted this as God's will that I
should compete on Sundays,'' said Edwards.
As for having re-defined his event yesterday, he said: ''Someone told
me this was the Beamon-jump at sea level. I don't like saying things
like that.'' Bob Beamon set a long jump mark in 1968 which lasted 23
years.
''The secret of my records? keeping the speed during run-ups and
take-off. To achieve 18 metres on my first jump was a surprise to me.''
Edwards was presented with his gold medal by the Queen of Sweden, to a
thunderous standing ovation which lasted almost two minutes. ''I was
embarrassed, they kept on clapping -- I'd wave and they'd clap again,''
said Edwards, who shook hands with every single official, a mark of
respect. ''Without them we couldn't take part.''
Gwen Torrence, the Olympic 200m champion, salvaged some sprint honour
for the USA, with victory in the women's 100m in 10.85secs. If allowed
to run the 4 x 400 for the USA, she could be in line for four golds.
Irina Privalova started appallingly, slowest to react to the gun, and
finshed third (10.96) behind 35-year-old Merlene Ottey (10.94).
Irina Stankina, who won the women's 10 kilometre walk -- and, of
course, a Mercedes, is the youngest ever world champion, aged 18. ''My
biggest problem is what to do with the car,'' she said. She does not
drive.
The leader, Hongmaio Gao (China) was disqualified for running when
within sight of the stadium, and had to be physically restrained by
officials as she attempted to continue. Two others were disqualified,
like the previous day when the leader and third-placed men's walkers
were also disqualified.
Roger Black and Mark Richardson reached tomorrow's 400m final, but
Michael Johnson seems invincible. Kelly Holmes, in the women's 1500m,
showed real class, finishing alongside Olympic champion Hassiba
Boulmerka to qualify for tomorrow's final, and has an outstanding chance
of gold.
Dan O'Brien (USA) won his third successive world decathlon title with
a total of 8695 pts, the world's best this year. Britain's Alex Cruger
was twelfth with 7993.

DOUGIE Lockhart of Glasgow Accies was celebrating last night. And no
wonder, after having notched his first century for Scotland's B side.
The teenager, voted player of the tournament in last month's Youth
World Cup, helped a makeshift second string reach 280 for nine declared
in the opening session of the three-day match against Durham B at
Stockton.
Neil MacRae, however, was out of luck. The Aberdeenshire batsman fell
two short of joining Lockhart on the three-figure mark.
MacRae and Lockhart staged a vital recovery after their team-mates
made the worst possible start. Skipper Alastair Storie fell to the
second ball of the match, and when Bryn Lockie went soon after, the
Scots were struggling at 45 for two.
But MacRae and Lockhart put on 144 runs for the third wicket to take
the initiative from Durham. MacRae, on trial with Essex earlier in the
season, was unlucky to drag a wide delivery on to his stumps when he
looked set for a century.
Lockhart finished unbeaten on 107, having hit eight boundaries and
faced 195 deliveries. In reply, Durham had reached 22 without loss by
the close. Scoreboard:
Scotland B 280 for nine decl. (D Lockhart 107n.o., N MacRae 98; R
Weston 4-60, D Williamson 3-87). Durham B 22 for no wicket.

ITALY are the new Admiral's Cup leaders after the third day of the
605-mile Fastnet Race.
The Italian three-boat team went into the Fastnet, the final race of
the Cup, 25 points adrift of the United States, who were on course to
lift the trophy for the first time in 26 years.
However, Bob Towse, skippering the American big boat Blue Yankee, has
so far struggled to cope with the light winds -- and that has allowed
Italy to come through to build-up a slender 7.16-point advantage with
some 300 miles of the race still to go.
Britain's Admiral's Cup chairman of selectors, Robin Aisher,
maintained his impressive overall lead at the head of the 24-yacht
fleet, and was 13 minutes ahead when the boats were logged by the race
committee.
In the ILC 40 class, a battle is developing between the Italians in
Brava Q8 and David Clarke, skipper of the US middle boat Pigs in Space.
Leaders:
Big Boat Class -- 1, Group 4 Seahorse (GB); 2, Capricorno (Italy); 3,
Pinta (Ger); 4, Mean Machine (Scandinavia); 5, Jameson I (Ire); 6,
Sansui Challenger (SA); 7, Bimblegumbie '97 (HK); 8, Blue Yankee (US).
ILC 40 class -- 1, Brava Q8 (Italy); 2, Pigs In Space (US); 3, Fram
XII (Scandinavia); 4, Jameson II (Ire); 5, Sansui Express (SA); 6, Group
4 Astro (GB); 7, Beau Geste (HK); 8, Anemos (Ger).
Mumm 36 class -- 1, Corum Cup (HK); 2, Thomas I Punkt (Ger); 3,
Skandia (Scandinavia); 4, No Problem (US); 5, Mumm A'Mia (Italy); 6,
Jameson III (Ire); 7, Sansui Sprinter (SA); 8, Group 4 Mumm (GB).
Provisional overall standings: 1, Italy 123.083pts; 2, United States
130.25; 3, Germany 161.00; 4, Scandinavia 168.50; 5, Ireland 215.25; 6,

THE Scottish Rugby Union will reveal today the nature of its
''amateurism'' submission to the International Board, which meets in
Paris at the end of the month in yet another attempt to resolve the
professionalism issue.
The board met in Bristol in the Spring, when it was to have formulated
new amateurism regulations, but postponed a decision until after the
World Cup.
Since then, the climate has changed in remarkable fashion with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation pumping millions of pounds into Southern
Hemisphere rugby through an exclusive broadcasting contract, and the
threat of a rebel global tournament bankrolled by arch rival Kerry
Packer through the World Rugby Corporation.
The SRU has previously acknowledged the players' demands for the
opportunity to increase their earnings from the game, but has drawn the
line at a ''pay-for-play'' scenario.
Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick yesterday described
the WRC blueprint for professional rugby union as ''very appealing,''
but insisted that money was not the main attraction.
The WRC has been wooing 900 players world-wide -- including New
Zealand, Australian and South African stars -- to sign contracts with a
rebel professional circuit instead of sticking with their national
unions.
Packer has unveiled the WRC proposal in direct competition to Murdoch,
who has clinched a 10-year, #350m TV rights deal with the national
unions of the three Southern Hemisphere countries.
Fitzpatrick, who revealed he had not yet signed a contract with the
WRC or committed himself, said of Packer's plan: ''If it was the money
that was the only thing motivating us, I would have taken the money the
New Zealand Rugby Union offered me four weeks ago, which was NZ$300,000
(around #130,000) to sign for one year, unconditional. But there are
other issues.''
On Thursday, at a resumed court hearing in Cape Town, Packer's World
Rugby Corporation will attempt to gain legal backing for its claim that
28 of South Africa's top players have signed contracts with WRC and
prevent the South African Rugby Football Union from interfering.

APART from restoring his pride, so bruisingly crushed in the surrender
of his World 100 metres title here, Linford Christie will have millions
of reasons to resurrect his career for the Atlanta Olympics next year.
Christie's future, whatever it may prove to be, is still laced up by
Puma, with whom he is in the first year of a four-year shoe contract
worth a reputed #500,000 per annum.
The company's sports promotions manager, Michael Hill, a German,
confirmed yesterday: ''His contract has still got a further three years
to go -- and we want him in Atlanta.''
Though the contract is not dependent on Christie continuing to
compete, in the clearest indictation that he is reconsidering his
retirement vow, he told Hill: ''I will be back. I will show them that I
am still the best.''
The Gothenburg church bells, which tolled for evensong with ironic
timing as Christie was helped from the track on Sunday night, may not
have rung out the final peal for the Olympic champion.
Christie went with Scottish team doctor Malcolm Brown to the Ostrah
Hospital here yesterday morning, for a scan which revealed ''serious,
but not severe'' bleeding in the hamstring. A number of medical options
are being considered.
Among those, and the most likely, is that today he will travel to the
Munich clinic of sports medicine guru Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wolfhart.
Darren Braithwaite has turned down the 200m place which Christie has
vacated, but hopes of his recovery mean Christie had not been completely
ruled out of a last-hurrah in the 4 x 100m relay.
His coach, Ron Roddan, says however that he cannot even see him racing
against newly-crowned world 100m champion Donovan Bailey in Zurich a
week tomorrow
Christie's brave handling of the way fate conspired against him has
lifted, rather than depressed the team. Scotland's Commonwealth champion
Yvonne Murray, who runs in tomorrow's 10,000m final, said: ''He is very
chirpy, and still encouraging everyone else in the team.''
* THE thoroughbred from Derby who soared to long jump gold for Italy
at the World Championships may lead the way to other defections by
leading British athletes.
Fiona May, who took Italian citizenship after having quit Britain two
years ago to live in Florence, did so because the British Athletic
Federation could not afford to help her. When May, already European and
World junior champion, appealed for support, they could offer just #500.
''It was like a charity hand-out,'' said May. Now the impoverished BAF
fears the worst. ''If the Government does not put extra money in, there
will be this same problem in the future,'' warned spokesman Tony Ward
yesterday.
''The Italian federation gets massive government funding through the
football pools. There is similar government backing in Germany, Spain,
and Portugal.
''Until our Government wakes up to the fact that we need more support,
we will continue to find it increasingly difficult to compete.''
Malcolm Arnold, UK director of coaching and development, says his
budget of #595,000 is ''wholly inadequate.''
It compares with #3.5m in Germany, and #12.8m in Italy. His budget is
now almost 40% less than that enjoyed by his Scottish predecessor, Frank
Dick, who resigned over the issue of what were described as ''doomsday
scenario'' cuts.
Arnold is campaigning for the Government to amend National Lottery
rules to allow backing for elite sportsmen and women. At the moment the
lottery is only for capital projects.
The #12.8m which Italian athletics receives makes it possible for them
to pay May #8000 per year as a training grant. In addition, she will
receive #40,000 from them for winning gold here.
''They give me 100% backing and encouragement,'' said May, who is
married to a pole vaulter. ''Physically I am the same athlete, but the
difference is the backing. I could never have done this in Britain.''
Ward said: ''We sympathise with what Fiona had to say, and have sent
her a telegram of congratulations. But our women could run off and marry
all over the place - particularly in Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal
. . . the men too, I guess.''

* THE International Amateur Athletic Federation have formally asked
Italian officials why they have not submitted Cuban Ivan Pedroso's long
jump mark, set at Sestriere on July 29, as a world record. Italian
federation spokesman Enrico Jacomini said yesterday that the IAAF had
requested the evidence following a Cuban protest.
Pedroso's jump of 8.96 metres in the Italian ski resort was one
centimetre longer than American Mike Powell's record set at the 1991
world championships in Tokyo. But the Italian federation decided it
would not submit the record for ratification by the sport's governing
body after video pictures showed a man standing in front of the wind
measuring machine during Pedroso's attempt.

BANK on Fiery Sun to prove too hot for his four opponents in today's
Blackpool Handicap Hurdle at Southwell. The 10-year-old has had five
different trainers and is now in his second spell with Teeside handler
Ron Barr.
It was Barr who trained Fiery Sun during the most successful spell of
the gelding's career, producing him to win three races between January
and March of 1993. Two of those victories came on the now defunct
all-weather hurdles course at Southwell and one thing Fiery Sun has
shown is a distinct preference for a sharp track.
He clearly retains plenty of enthusiasm for the game, having been
placed on the Flat at Lingfield in February and shown solid form over
hurdles last month.
He went down by a length to Skolern here -- the pair 14 lengths clear
-- and then returned a solid effort at Market Rasen, finishing three
lengths third to Innocent George.
The latter contest looked a decent one for this stage of the season
and the runner-up, Chicago's Best, has since trotted up at Worcester.
Fiery Sun faces poorer opposition today. Richmond and Gunmaker are
plating class, while Have A Nightcap looks a difficult ride. And the
unreliable Plato's Republic sports a visor for the first time after
finishing tailed-off last at Worcester this afternoon.
Kaifoon looks to have found an ideal opportunity to open his account
in the Southend Maiden Hurdle.
A winner on the Flat in Austria, the six-year-old began to get the
hang of things over hurdles towards the end of last season, notably when
a neck second to Holy Joe at Chepstow in April. That form stands head
and shoulders above anything his rivals have achieved.
The rejuvenated Palmrush should complete a hat trick in the Skegness
Handicap Chase. He won easily over course and distance last month and
then saw off Sword Beach by three lengths at Market Rasen.

SPGA MASTERS:
A No.3-wood strike from deep rough which set up an eagle 3 paved the
way for home professional Andrew Crerar to lead the field after the
first round of the SPGA Masters at Downfield yesterday.
The 27-year-old Dundonian carded a new course record eight-under-par
65 to move one stroke clear of David Thomson and Hamish Kemp.
But it was the shot at the 480-yard thirteenth hole which proved the
catalyst. A poor drive had seen him find the left rough, leaving him the
option of chipping out or having a go over the top of the trees in
front.
''It was a bit of a heart in the mouth shot and in the end it only
cleared the trees by about three feet, but it landed on the green 30
feet from the pin and I holed the putt,'' said Crerar.
Inspired, he also eagled the next hole, the 515-yard fourteenth and
could even afford a slip at the last, where he carded a bogey 5, and
still lead the chase for the #3500 first prize.
Paul Lawrie, taking a break from the rigours of the European circuit
to be present at the christening of his son Craig, finished on 69.
''I've only got six Euro tournaments left this season, but I'm playing
well and I feel the work I'm doing now with David Leadbetter is
beginning to pay off. I feel I'm capable of a top-10 finish and should
be capable of retaining my card.'' Leading scores:
65 -- A Crerar (Downfield).
66 -- H Kemp (Bishopbriggs GR), D Thomson (Kings Links).
67 -- S Syme (Glenrothes).
68 -- J McCreadie (Buchanan Castle), S Russell (Hilton Park), R
Russell (Longniddry).
69 -- B Kelly (Callander), A Webster (Edzell), F Coutts (Deeside), P
Lawrie (unattached).
70 -- D Scott (Letham Grange), J Greaves (Glasgow), C Brooks
(Glencorse), D Robinson (Fereneze).
* A REDUCTION in funding from sponsors Aberdeen District Council has
forced next week's Granite City Classic at Hazlehead to be cut from 72
to 36 holes.
The tournament was scheduled to run from August 16 to 18 with a prize
fund of #25,000, but it will now only take place on the first two days
with the total purse halved to #12,500.
Reassessment of the Council's budget has forced the re-think and,
although disappointed, Scottish PGA secretary Neil Simpson admitted he
was pleased the event had not been abandoned altogether.
''We have worked hard with the Aberdeen District Council to ensure the
Granite City name has reappeared on the schedule and hopefully we can
build from this to make it a 72-hole tournament next year,'' said
Simpson.
''My colleagues in the English regions are staging four-rounders with
prize funds of only #9000. Sometimes we forget how lucky we are up
here.''
* HILARY Monaghan has overtaken Sharon McMaster again, by 30 points
this time, to lead the Laing the Jeweller Scottish Women's Order of
Merit after the sixth of eight counting events at Hamilton last Sunday.
Monaghan finished third in the Riccarton Rose Bowl at Hamilton while
McMaster was joint seventh. Positions:
1, H Monaghan (Longniddry) 370 points; 2, S McMaster (Dunbar) 340; 3,
A Rose (Stirling) 325; 4, L Nicholson (Haddington) 280; 5, L Roxburgh
(Tain) 200; 6, J Moodie (Windhill) 170; 7, H Stirling (Bridge of Allan)
160; 8 (equal), A Gemmell (Barassie), C Hargan (Cardross) 140; 10, A
Laing (Vale of Leven) 125.

RANGERS' Paul Gascoigne and Brian Reid will make their European debuts
against Anorthosis Famagusta in the European Cup preliminary round tie
at Ibrox tomorrow night.
And there could not be a greater contrast between two players
appearing on the biggest club soccer stage of them all for the first
time.
Gascoigne, has, as they say, seen it all and done it all -- except in
European club tournaments -- and this is where the #4.3m man wants to
make his mark.
Reid, in contrast, has done little since joining Rangers from Morton
four years ago. More than a year was spent out of football after he
suffered damage to a cruciate ligament in a testimonial game soon after
having signed for the Ibrox club.
Tomorrow night, however, the two players with such differing
backgrounds want the same thing -- to prove to manager Walter Smith and
to the Rangers fans that they have major contributions to make in the
coming season.
Gascoigne wants to dispel any doubts which have surrounded his fitness
since he left Lazio to come to Glasgow and to underline that his genius
has not withered in the wilderness years spent in Rome.
Reid wants to prove that he merits a new contract after more than a
year of signing on a month-to-month basis after having asked for a
transfer a year ago.
Thoughts of leaving the club have now gone and Reid admits: ''I don't
want to go anywhere. I asked away because of the frustration of playing
in the reserves when it seemed there was no place for me in the
first-team squad.
''That changed towards the end of last season when I came back into
contention and I spoke to the manager about my position then, and,
again, in the summer.
''If I can keep playing as I have been doing then there could be a
place for me and, if that is the case, then I have the chance of a new
deal.
''There were times when I wondered if I could come back and reach the
level of performance I had before the injury. But I looked at Ian
Durrant and realised what can be done.
''The three-at-the-back system suits me perfectly. I enjoy that and it
doesn't matter to me that the club have signed Gordan Petric. All that
does is add to the challenge. It is up to me now.''
Petric, of course, is not available for the Ibrox tie because of a
European suspension. But, even if he could play, there was always the
chance that he would have been left out. The three foreigners' rule
might have necessitated that.
Smith relaxed at Turnberry yesterday, mulling over his team but still
refusing to name it. But Ally McCoist is fit again and only the foreign
players' ruling can cause him headaches.
It looks certain Smith will use Gascoigne, Mark Hateley, and Brian
Laudrup as his quota of foreign players and his team is likely to be:
Goram, Wright, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Reid, Ferguson, Gascoigne,
Laudrup, Hateley, McCoist.
As for the opposition, Smith pointed out: ''They days when you could
expect to beat a Cypriot side or some of the other so-called minnows by
a load of goals have gone.
''They are organised and talented and we want to be able to put
ourselves in a strong position in the home leg because we know it could
be difficult over there. All I can say is that we feel more confident
about things this season than we did in the two previous years when we
had injury problems.
''Gascoigne and Laudrup give us extra options but if we are to win
then we need a team effort. That is what can carry us into the
Champions' League.''
Despite the game being live on television, and despite the lack of big
names in the opposition, the match is a sell out.

HUGH McKibbin, whose defence of the J&amp;B Scottish Amateur Golf
Championship ended in defeat on Saturday, has revealed an arm injury
hindered his challenge in the final.
The Troon Welbeck player, who went down by 8 and 7 against West
Linton's Simon Mackenzie, woke up on Saturday morning to find a touch of
tennis elbow in his left arm.
The Ayrshireman took the neccessary steps to ensure he could tee up
against Mackenzie, but a subsequent trip to the doctor has seen him
advised to take complete rest.
''I didn't want to say anything on Saturday, because it might have
taken the gloss off Simon's performance. He deserved his win,'' said
McKibbin.
''But my elbow did swell up and bit and when I went to the doctor he
said he didn't think it would be a wise thing for me to play for the
next week or so.''
The injury will rule McKibbin out of the Standard Life Gold Medal at
Leven this weekend, but he feels his track record may earn him a place
in the Walker Cup team.
''I hope the selectors look at the broader picture, and I have a good
record,'' said McKibbin.

LIKE the song says about spring, European football is a little early
this year, just as it was twelve months ago when only Motherwell managed
to survive the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. Rangers, defeated in
the European Cup and Aberdeen, beaten in the UEFA Cup, had to start the
domestic season knowing that their extra-mural activities were over for
another season. This time, we hope. it will be different.
In Motherwell's case, the task is much more difficult. A year ago they
were always likely to be too good for the team from the Faroes, Hanvar
Boltfelag, but their opponents in the first leg at Fir Park tonight,
MyPa 47 of Finland, are made of far sterner stuff. The fact that they
are top of the Finnish league, with 12 wins in 17 league games to date,
scoring 30 goals and losing only 13, suggests that they are very
capable, at least at their own level.
The Fir Park manager, Alex McLeish, readily agrees they are a deal
more formidable than the side from the Faroes. ''They are a lot better
than that and in fact are not a bad side at all. We will have to play
well to win.''
The major problem for McLeish and his team is match fitness, compared
with a side that is clearly at its peak in mid-season. ''When you look
around and see teams setting out on pre-season tours at the same time as
we are starting out in Europe you wonder about things but we are happy
to have this chance.
The pursuit of match fitness persuaded McLeish to take his players on
a stiff pre-season trip to Belgium and Germany, rather than a simpler
option to the Highlands. ''It is sharpness that is the target and it was
with that in mind that we crammed in five games in twelve days.''
McLeish and his team have been eyeing the chance of European
excitement ever since they put up such a good show against Borussia
Dortmund in the first round last season. Dortmund's subsequent capture
of the Bundesliga title has done nothing to diminish Motherwell's pride
in a stalwart show, albeit ultimately in vain, and they woould like
another slice of the fun and fame that goes with that high profile
contest.
The absence of striker Dougie Arnott, who is suspended for the first
leg after having been sent off in the return match with the Germans last
term, is a blow but Motherwell will have new man John Henry, from Spurs,
and Dutchman Mitchel van der Gaag, who has played only one game because
of injury since his arrival from PSV Eindhoven last March, in place.
Van de Gaag, who has some experience at Champions' League standard as
well as UEFA Cup level, is eager to show what he can do to the local
aficionados but he points out that he and his mates will have to be
careful about the Finns. ''MyPa are an improving team and my friends in
Holland tell me that they have many promising young players. But
Motherwell were runners-up in Scotland last season and should be capable
of competing in Europe.''

BERNARD Gallacher's Ryder Cup problems may be mounting after Jesper
Parnevik's Scandinavian Open win on Sunday. But American captain Lanny
Wadkins is not exactly trouble free either as he heads for Los Angeles
this week and the US PGA Championship.
Corey Pavin and Davis Love are certain to retain their places, Tom
Lehman, Phil Mickelson, Jay Haas, Loren Roberts, Ben Crenshaw, and Peter
Jacobsen look safe, but Mark Calcavecchia and Kenny Perry, currently
ninth and tenth in the table, are under threat from any number of
players.
Failure to shine this week will leave the likes of John Daly reliant
on one of the two wild cards which Wadkins will name next Monday.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will name his squad today for next week's
European Championship match against Greece at Hampden.
Brown could be ready to unleash his own Little and Large strike-force
in a game which could take his team towards qualification for next
summer's finals in England.
He has watched both Everton frontman Duncan Ferguson and Chelsea
striker John Spencer in the past week and both players will be named in
the pool of players.
The two controversial former Rangers men could be asked to team up
against the Greeks.
Clearly, Brown has forgiven Spencer for his ordering-off in Japan
during the summer, although he left him out of the team which he took to
the Faroe Islands a few weeks after that.
Ferguson, who also missed the Faroes' game, is now considered to be
fully match fit by Brown, who was impressed by his performance against
Celtic at Goodison last week.
Both Ferguson and Blackburn Rovers' centre half Colin Hendry have been
banned from playing in the Charity Shield game next weekend.
Brown had already asked for the premier division programme to be
postponed. That has happened and the Charity Shield veto followed on
from there.
Rangers' Ally McCoist is unlikely to be included but goalkeeper Andy
Goram will be among the men named.
The only absentees through injury are Celtic skipper Paul McStay and
Bolton's John McGinlay.

JIM McInally, a veteran of 25 European ties, is convinced Scottish
clubs have lost the ability to strike fear into their continental rivals
and have declined in power as a consequence.
Tonight the aggressive midfield player will lead by example when he
guides a youthful Raith Rovers side through their debut in Europe
against Gotu IF, of the Faroe Islands, at Starks Park.
McInally, signed for #150,000 during the close season, was a
formidable member of the Dundee United side which reached the UEFA Cup
final against IFK Gothenburg nine years ago.
Since then he has watched in dismay as Scottish clubs have suffered
and repeatedly come off second best against the continentals.
He warned: ''We must get the fear factor back into our game. The
Europeans have copied us to a certain extent. Even AC Milan at their
peak harried and hassled like we used to do.
''They have learned from us but we have never learned from them. When
Dundee United were a team to be reckoned with in Europe we stopped other
teams from playing then relied on a break to take us through.
''But as the years have gone by, Scottish teams thought they were as
good as the continentals and paid the penalty.
''I remember when they were afraid to play Scottish teams because they
knew they were in for a battle. Now, that fear has gone.
''I want Raith to get stuck into the Faroese like we used to and let
them know that they have been a tie.''
McInally will be playing in his twenty-sixth European tie but many of
his young team-mates are rookies.
''The fact that they are so naive could be a help rather than a
hindrance. They won't worry about the occasion. ''It is important that
we don't lose a goal at Starks Park. Europe is a bonus for us because so
many people expect us to be relegated this season.'' Manager Jimmy
Nicholl, who has no injury worries, said: ''Gotu are useful and
disciplined. There is no reason for us to believe they are going to be
easy just because they are part-timers.
''Last season Trelleborg scraped through against them before beating
Blackburn Rovers.

THE continued fine weather has produced a rash of fine scoring this
week, not least of all Peter Robertson's eight-under-par 63, which was a
course record for Bothwell Castle.
The 31-year-old housing officer, whose handicap has fallen from two to
one as a result of his performance in the club's July Medal, tallied
nine birdies in halves of 31 and 32 and a solitary bogey at the sixth.
The score beat by one shot the previous record, held by Walker Cup
player-to-be Stephen Gallacher, posted in the West of Scotland Open two
years ago when, by coincidence, he was playing in the same group as
Robertson.
''I knew what I had to beat and felt I needed to reach nine under to
be sure, because the eighteenth is a difficult par 4,'' said the
three-times club champion. ''I left myself a putt of four to five feet,
but in it went.''
The club are recognising the feat by posting the card on the clubhouse
wall and removing Gallacher's.
For the record, his score featured birdies at the first, second,
fourth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, thirteenth and fourteenth, plus
that solitary lapse when he put his ball underneath a bush.
Robertson credited precise iron play for his score, and he was left
with few long putts except for a 30-footer at the thirteenth -- lucky
for some.
His score converts to minus 6 on Parbusters, leaving him in joint
third place in the overall list with one week of qualifying to go, and
thus virtually certain to qualify for the final at Haggs Castle on
October 4.
There is a new leader in the women's scratch section, Hamilton's
Alyson Hendry's 67 in the Dalziel Trophy working out at a Parbusters
minus 5, and Cathcart Castle's Karen Fitzgerald moves into third place
on minus 3.
Bandit of the week, meanwhile, is Bellshill's Lynn Paterson, who shot
a gross 90 in the club's August Medal -- less a handicap of 31 -- for a
net 59 and a Parbusters minus 13, another almost certain qualifier. This
week's leading scores:

ROBERT McKinnon, of Paisley, writes with a query relating to an
incident at the par-5 fourteenth in the second round of the Open
Championship at St Andrews.
The second shot of American Jay Haas rolled over the green, stopping
on the fringe beside a bunker. Lee Trevino then played a similar shot
and his ball knocked Haas's into the sand, unseen by players or
officials.
Under Rule 18-5 Haas was required to replace his ball on the fringe
as, apparently, he did, but Mr McKinnon asks whether it is essential
either the players or an official witness the event and furthermore:
''Are they entitled to take the word of a spectator, in this case, of
course, many hundreds, but in lesser tournaments it may be one man and
his dog?''
The evidence of spectators can and should be taken into account if an
incident such as this is unseen by players or officials, but if it is
''one man and his dog'' the position is different.
Decision 18-1/4 declares that a player -- if no official is
immediately available -- is not bound to take the word of a spectator
that his ball at rest has been moved.
The recommended strokeplay procedure is to follow Rule 3-3 and play a
second ball from the spot where the original ball was alleged to have
been moved, holing out with both balls and referring the matter to the
committee at the end of the round.
The committee are advised to speak to the spectator, if possible, in
reaching their decision on which ball counts for the score.
Decision 18-1/3 deals with the situation where, unknown to the player,
his ball at rest has been moved and unwittingly he completes the hole
without rectifying the matter. In that case, if he tees off at the next
hole and then learns what happened there is no penalty for not replacing
the ball and the score with the moved ball stands.
At the Open, of course, where there are many spectators and a referee
with each match, there should be no problem sorting it out on the spot.

* THIS week's tip comes from Robert Farrell, the professional at
Cardross Golf Club.
PLAYING a shot from a plugged lie demands a technique that is very
different from a conventional bunker shot. The main difference is that
the face of the sand iron should be square or even slightly shut at
address.
Many amateurs make the mistake of keeping the clubface open. This
results in too much sand being hit during the shot, and the ball is
likely to stay in the bunker.
At address, swivel the feet well into the sand and adopt a slightly
open stance. If the ball is plugged in the face of the bunker, lean into
the slope. It is imperative that you do not lose your balance when
hitting the shot.
The ball should be positioned around the middle of the stance, and the
backswing should be fairly steep. This will produce a steeper angle of
attack -- hit down on the ball.
The shoulders arms and clubhead should feel as though they are working
together through the shot, and the clubhead should follow a path along
the line of the toes.
Another difference from the everyday bunker escape is that the
follow-through need not be so long. Concentrate on an explosive shot and
keep the weight well on the left side.

THE bare figures on a scorecard often fail to tell the true story.
There is the tale, for example, of the club player at Coombe Wood,
Surrey, whose errant approach to the sixteenth green fell down the
vertical exhaust of a tractor. A few moments later, after compression
built up, the ball shot back out like a rocket and came to rest close to
the pin.
The figure 3 on the card, if that is indeed what it was, is a very
poor official record of that incident.
In the professional game, there has long been recognition that the
bare scores per hole are insufficient for those in search of the
absolute truth. So we have weekly outpourings of stroke averages (leader
Colin Montgomerie 70.00), driving accuracy (John Bland 93.75% fairways
hit), sand saves (Peter Fowler 55.64%), birdies (Costantino Rocca 278),
eagles (Peter Baker, Peter Mitchell, Darren Clarke 12), and so on.
Interestingly, there has been a recent change in the putting stats.
Previously, listings were in putts per round, but as that tended to
throw up leaders who had low ratings in the greens-in-regulation
category, and therefore were always more likely to have their first
putts from much closer range, the European Tour have changed that aspect
to ''putts per green in regulation.''
Those at the top, who before would have had figures of around 28 per
round, now have averages to three decimal points (Michael Campbell top
on 1.716 per green).
Great stuff -- if you like stats.
How, then, can we club golfers analyse our scores? In a roundabout way
-- as a result of so far fruitless attempts to discover the precise
difference between 90 and 100 compression balls -- a copy of ''Golf: the
Scientific Way,'' edited by Alastair Cochran, has come into my
possession.
The complicated data on ball performances discouraged any further
research into compression, but an article by American golf analyst, Dr
Lucius Riccio, entitled ''What it takes to break 80,'' caught the
attention instead.
Isn't that, after all, the realistic ambition of the majority of club
golfers?
Having analysed the scores of 100 golfers of widely ranging ability
averaging eight rounds each -- a total of some 60,000 shots -- he has
come up with a formula which he calls, after himself, ''Riccio's Rule.''
This rule states: score equals 95 minus two times the number of greens
hit in regulation (GIR). Therefore, you must have eight GIRs to break 80
(95 minus two times eight equals 79). One might imagine that this
formula would vary according to standard scratch score, but he does not
say so, and I am frightened to ask.
GIR, though, he found, had the highest correlation with score. With
1.0 a perfect match GIR tallied 0.93, followed by distance the ball is
hit (0.64), number of badly-hit shots (0.63), iron-club accuracy (0.54),
and putting (also 0.54).
Riccio notes that the often-used excuse for a poor score, putting, is
an illusion: ''This study indicates that if a professional did the
putting for a golfer who shoots 90, his score would almost never go
below 80. At most, he may pick up four strokes, most likely one to
three.''
Accepting, then, that Riccio's Rule is correct -- and the European
Tour change in relating putting to GIR hints that it might be -- the
position is thus: If you have more GIRs than required for your score
then your short game needs attention -- unless there were a lot of fluke
shots via a tractor exhaust; if less, then your full swing is worse than
it should be for your scoring ability.
Something, perhaps, to mull over next time you step into a bath to
replay your last round in your head. Just think, 13 GIRs equals a score
of 69, but let's not get carried away.
On the other hand, you may prefer to head for the bar, forget all
about it, and tell Riccio what he can do with his rule.

HOW about this for a nightmare? I wake up, and the Underground train
has reached Heathrow Terminal One. I snatch my bag as the doors are
closing and stumble aboard the escalator, missing the step, toe and
heeling it. I'm sweating and I'm a splayed mess when the thing deposits
me at the top, like a drowned dog on a watermill. It's far too late for
me to be here and they are closing the last flight.
Still, I make an attempt at it. I have my Timesaver, the little
plastic ticket expressly designed to be confused in a stuffed wallet
with telephone cards, identity cards, kidney donor cards, and the smart
card you stupidly forgot to return at hotel checkout. They are all out
on the deck. But I have my Timesaver slug. I even have it the right way
up in the machine, and it brings up the little computer game they like
to make of selling you a ticket. The graphics roll.
A map of Britain. Enter destination. Glasgow. Enter costsaving centre.
Nope. Window or aisle? Waisle. Enter name. Mr JJJJLimmknaaakr. When you
prod a forefinger at the virtual keyboard sheltering behind its glass
panel, you either get nothing, you miss your letter completely or you
get multiples. All your touch-typing skills vanish at this implacable
window. Anyhow, it goes through the travesty of this facility test,
practically tutting at every blunder, before it announces that the
system is down. Could I proceed to . . .
The man at the desk wants me to fill in a form because I don't have a
boarding pass. My position, as expounded, is that time wasted on my
Timesaver will no longer permit such a dalliance, that he might wish to
take my slug as an earnest of good faith, and that I should make my way
to the gate without further delay. He reports me for abuse. They pick me
up trying to get my bag through the security scanner.
Halfway through the altercation some officious little shit is
delighted to announce that the last Glasgow flight has closed. And I'm
out of there, turning on my heel. At the telephones I'm not getting any
dialling tone. I slump over to a seat to review my situation.
These are the options. I can sit here fuming all night, concentrating
all my venom into a consuming hatred of Heathrow Airport. Exacting
revenge by compiling a list of grievances to the British Airport
Authority, everything from the scandalous lack of headroom for anyone
above five feet seven to the joke of even considering the bomb site for
a fifth runway. The only terminal thing Heathrow should get is a
demolition order.
Or I can get a hotel room and start again in the morning. My only
reservation is that there are few things less attractive than the
prospect of an overnight at Heathrow Airport, but one of them is using a
Heathrow Airport hotel. I remember a night at Bucharest Airport when I
was put in transit and ended up partying until the morning with the
entire staff from the bar, the restaurant and the women from duty free.
As the Mossad agent arrived to run a security check for the first flight
out to Tel Aviv we were dancing flamencos on the table tops. But fraught
Heathrow is not mad Bucharest. Fat chance of a party with the people
drawing the metal grids down over Tie Rack and Sock Shop. I got a hotel
reservation and went out to find a transfer coach.
An hour later you are beginning to recognise the sequence. The
five-star hotels have big coaches that cruise round every 10 minutes and
extract their smug patrons from this awful pavement. The middle-range
hotels punctuate this service sporadically but diligently. A few other
forlorns have to wait longer for their mini-bus. Only mine never
appears, and even the drivers have begun to pity me, as much as the
environs of Heathrow can still allow any emotion outside of rampant
hysteria.
When it finally arrives he wants to know how many I am. This is not an
inquiry as to my state of mental health, apparently, but a reflection on
the squeeze in his vehicle, if it could be termed such. An American
couple are sobbing in the back, and that's just about as much as the van
or I can take.
At the reception desk we haggle prices. They want 10 more than I was
quoted over the phone. I want what the other new arrival has just
accepted, and that's ten less than I was quoted. But that includes
dinner and breakfast, I'm told. It's just because we're empty. I agree
to take dinner and breakfast for #10 less, but strictly in that order.
In the bar there's only one other man, and he doesn't speak English.
I've joined him. He is Saudi Arabian and he speaks fluent numbers. He
talks millions, then thousands, and I don't know to what these figures
might relate. When he comes down to mere teens -- 15, 13, and 18 -- I
think he is referring to sons, daughters, and wives. He has more than
me, anyhow, of everything.
Upstairs on the landing I'm having the usual difficulty with the hotel
door. The card is in the slot, but no matter which way you slide it, no
matter how quickly you flick it in and out, the little eye shines red
instead of green in its brass casement. Exasperated, I take out the card
to yell at it. ''Oneshot,'' it reads. ''Timesaver.'' Nightmare did I
say? This one won't end until I find some sleep.

IT may be a spring blip whose significance will prove transient once
the impact of a sun-soaked summer is revealed. But yesterday's
disappointing quarterly export evidence from the Scottish Council
Development and Industry is one more brick in a growing wall of
evidence, both official and circumstantial, that the economic recovery
is moving into a decidedly slower lane. The 26 firms whose export sales
data every three months forms the basis of the index account for roughly
half of all Scottish manufactured exports. That in itself is a sharp
reminder that Scotland's much vaunted exporting capability -- higher,
per capita, than the Japanese, as ministers are persistently fond of
reminding us -- is concentrated in very few corporate hands. But the 26
cover the spectrum, from whisky to chemicals, from transport equipment
to computers and microchips. The index uses real data from half
Scotland's exporting capacity to project a performance measure for the
entire exporting community.
Last April, collectively, their expectations implied that Scotland
would despatch #4330m of exports in the April-June quarter. In fact,
collectively exporters managed just #3730m of overseas sales in the
period. Somehow #600m worth of business simply didn't happen. It's not
that there were massive adverse shifts in currency exchange rates with
our major trading partners over the period. Against the dollar and the
mark the picture has been relatively stable. So where did all that
business go? Whisky, which has been having a tough time in other
respects, continued to grow its exports modestly. So did chemicals and
mechanical engineering. Sales of computers and peripherals held up too.
The main cause of the index's dive has apparently been the rest of the
electronics sector. Exports of microchips, other consumer electronics,
and defence equipment are largely responsible for the fall.
The unexpected fall in defence equipment shipments is explicable as
countries continue to cut their procurement programmes. The decline in
demand for things like television sets reflects a weakness in consumer
demand which is not confined to the UK. The export underperformance of
the semiconductor sector is more surprising, giving the rush, by
Siemens, NEC, Motorola, and others, to build expensive new production
capacity on the grounds that global demand continues to roar ahead. We
should not, of course, try to read too much into one quarter's data. But
with so many of our exporting eggs in so few corporate baskets, we
should expect more such turbulence in the figures in future quarters.

THE people of Glasgow have, perhaps, become a little too confident in
their own good news. In many respects the city, if not necessarily miles
better than any other place on earth, is a very good place to live. It
always has been, and this happy effect has been accentuated in recent
years. Nevertheless, Glasgow is still a large and sprawling city with
hundreds of thousands of citizens, many of whom are good, some of whom
are unruly, and including a tiny minority who are downright bad. In this
respect Glasgow is like any other city and still a great improvement on
some that we could name.
Nevertheless, complacency is not in order. The appalling murders over
the past weekend have jolted confidence and have not helped the city's
image. This is a pity, but it will be forgotten relatively quickly.
Nevertheless it is irrelevant compared with the potential effect on the
people of Glasgow. It is a sad fact that any reported increase in
violence, or the incidence of as many murders as have just taken place,
affects adversely the confidence of people in the area. Old people
become nervous and tend to withdraw while younger people might curtail
their activities or worry unnecessarily. This is the extended effect of
violence: the first sufferers are the victims, but the ripples of unease
and anxiety which spread are also undoubtedly damaging.
At this time it is important to listen to the police, and specifically
the Chief Constable, Leslie Sharp. Despite having to announce a rise in
crimes of violence just last week, Chief Constable Sharp insists that
the statistics show that the vast majority of people can go about their
business or pleasure without threat or disturbance. It is important to
hold on to this for it is true. A surrender to fear about crime is a
surrender to dark phantoms and just as serious as bending in the face of
the real thing. There may be other issues. The Strathclyde force may
need more officers and the Labour Home Affairs Spokesman must expand on
his comments about listening to community voices, but the essential
message remains the need for vigilance but not fear.

IT is questionable if even Willie Hamilton, retired MP, sometime
scourge of the royal family, would have stooped so low as Jack McLean in
his column (August 4).
It was a coincidence that adjacent thereto Julie Davidson's
contribution is headed ''What parents must endure for innocence of
children''.
Jack McLean must have been a child. Whether he was innocent or not, I
have as much knowledge thereof as he possesses of the relationships
existing in the Queen Mother's household yesteryear, but an innocent
adult he surely is not.
He may well have been his mother's pride, but he must have been
''loafing'' in his South Side ''club'' or some other howff when he
composed this contemptuous column denigrating not only the Queen Mother
but seemingly all women.
Sir, to have allowed the publication of his column I claim you have
overstretched the patience and loyalty of many of your readers.
The Herald has a readership furth of Scotland and your wish, as of
your readers, is for its even wider circulation. The gratuitous and
snide comments of Jack McLean are not just unhelpful, but an
embarrassment, even, I venture to suggest, to misogynists and those with
republican sympathies on the attainment of a 95th birthday, regardless
of personage.

. . . in your ear, Michael. There's no point in looking dished just
because System Three doesn't think you've made much of an impact on the
electorate so far. Where's that old fighting Stirling spirit? What's
that you say? Yes, Stirling is one thing, and a lousy position in the
national polls is quite another, but if you can swing a constituency
dyed deepest red in spots you can do the same thing around the country.
Have you spoken to the experts yet? What has Warner Meek Communications
Ltd got to say about it all? Let's hope they aren't banging on about
being pro-active and all those other trendy media phrases. You have been
active. For heaven's sake, you've even smiled at Cosla. You've been out
and about, you've listened to people. Short of kissing babies, you've
been about as conciliatory as you can get and it doesn't seem to have
made a jot of difference.
Here's the rub. We can't go on dismissing devolution as a product of
the chattering classes. You've hired two of them and one is a
devolutionist, even if he has been practising reverse steps of late. The
other one seems to be a Jacobite, but I don't know what that's got to do
with anything. (Or is it a Jacobin? Anyway, he's an intellectual.) Back
to basics, Michael. Out in the streets they want Scotland to have more
control over its own affairs. No, of course they don't formulate it in
political language. It's a gut thing and that's about the only part of
the political anatomy we haven't looked at yet. Talking about giving
power to people at local level isn't the same at all. Nor is tinkering;
have you found anyone who actually likes the new council set-up? Nor is
presentation. You can dress a bad policy up in tinsel but it will still
look like a bad policy, only worse. Ask W-M Comms Ltd, they've been
doing it for years. What we need is a re-think of this devolution thing.
A serious re-think followed by serious policy proposals. Trust me, it's
the only hope. And there's a silver lining. Just think about the top job
in a devolved Scotland; better than Secretary of State any day.
To be continued.

FOLLOWING Labour's all-new rock-solid commitment to a Scots parliament
could we Scots have absolute confirmation from Tony Blair, George
Robertson, Tam Dalyell, and Jack Straw on a number of points if Labour
were to be elected?
Will a home rule Bill be passed by Westminster? Since 1989 no fewer
than 34 Scots home rule Bills have been presented to the Commons. All
have failed.
Will all Labour MPs back a Scots home rule bill (in 1979 many voted
against)?
Will any referendum be by straight majority and have no 40% rule?
Will any future Scots parliament be fireproof from dissolution by a
future hostile Westminster government?

FOR Councillor Robert Aldridge to state baldly that ''David Steel's
commitment to home rule for Scotland has never wavered,'' in reply to my
charge that David Steel expediently did a complete volte-face on the
issue at the time of the devolution referendum, is just not good enough
(August 3).
Documented fact is not hard to come by on this matter and it refutes
the councillor's assertion. And, anyway, anyone involved in campaigning
on the pros and cons of the issue in David Steel's constituency at that
time should be able readily to confirm what I say.
May I suggest that if Councillor Aldridge truly considers me to be in
error, however, that he uses his position in the party to call on Sir
David personally to make a public statement on the matter.
As for Tower Hamlets and the race issue, I would suggest that the less
the Lib Dems say on this matter the better. For years prior to the Tower
Hamlets election reports had been circulating around Lib Dem national
HQ.
These reports showed that the Tower Hamlets local party was producing
literature which was blatantly racial in character. And for years the
national party turned a blind eye to the problem.
The much-vaunted and long-overdue inquiry into the matter was nothing
more than a damage-limitation exercise behind which the embattled
national party could shelter.
But of course Tower Hamlets was not an isolated incident. The race
card has been played on many occasions by the Lib Dems before,
particularly in the English inner city areas. I quoted Ladywood as an
example but I could, quite as easily, have quoted a dozen more.
If Alistair G Tough really considers my charges to be ''ill-founded''
I would suggest that this illustrates little else than a lack of
research on his part (August 3). Mr Tough's conclusion on the meaning of
the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election shows political innocence.
Any impartial political analyst worth his salt will point out that the
true long-term beneficiary from the result can only be Labour.

F GILLINGHAM argues that capitalism will inevitably collapse but is
sceptical of the claim that it will be replaced by socialism, which he
sees as wishful thinking (July 28). While no-one can predict the future,
I would suggest that socialist confidence has a more substantial
foundation than that.
The first human societies were tribal communities in which the land
and its resources were held in common. This corresponded to the very low
technological base of these societies, which was at best sufficient to
ensure bare subsistence. As technology improved it became possible to
produce a surplus on a regular basis.
However, this surplus product was not yet sufficient to meet the needs
of the entire community. By and by there arose societies whose social
constitution was the monopoly of the means of production in the hands of
a privileged minority, and with that the cleavage of society into
separate and mutually antagonistic class interests.
While the social product remained at a certain level, it could not
have been otherwise.
This system prevailed until the emergence of capitalism. Under
capitalism the powers of production have risen to unprecedented heights.
The potential now exists to satisfy human needs on a global scale.
The realisation of this potential can only render class society
redundant. No one section of society will then be able to use the wealth
of society to subjugate the labour of others. Indeed it is precisely
because of capitalism's class nature that this potential remains
unrealised.
Furthermore, whereas previous class societies had very complex class
structures and relations of production, in capitalism there are but two
major classes -- workers and capitalists.
With capitalism economic relations are reduced to their simplest form
-- wage-labour, commodity production, the law of value. It can
reasonably be stated that with capitalism class society reaches its
highest, thus its final, stage of development.
For these reasons post-capitalist society is most likely to be, not a
new type of class society, but a classless society, in which the means
of production belong to everyone. Not an ideal world, free of all
problems, but something which is implicit in the world as it is now.
Neither then is capitalism going to collapse, as Mr Gillingham would
have it. If the post-capitalist world is to be based on common
ownership, then the act of bringing this about cannot but be a conscious
and deliberate act.
Yet, according to your correspondent, the workers will not attain the
level of consciousness this implies. If this is true, then Fukuyama and
his ilk are right, and capitalism is the end of history.
But if Mr Gillingham can get beyond capitalist consciousness, then why
not the rest of us?

I WANT to express my thanks to Glasgow for the very kind treatment it
gave to an injured American tourist.
My husband and I were walking on Park Road near Great Western Road. We
had been exploring the Hunterian Museum, then Kelvingrove Park, and I
was very tired. Somehow I stumbled and fell with a crash to the
sidewalk, smashing my nose and chin. I was dazed and bleeding and my
husband frantically called for assistance.
A young man, dressed formally in kilt for a wedding, stopped his car
and with the help of several passers-by got me into the rear seat. He
insisted on taking us to the Western Infirmary. In his anxious state of
mind my husband forgot to get the young man's name, and only thanked him
with a handshake.
I hope you print this letter, and he reads it. He was truly a Good
Samaritan.
I also want to thank the very kind and thorough doctor and two nurses
who cleaned my wounds and ''patched me up.'' I still wear dark glasses
to keep people from being frightened by my black eyes, but all is going
well.
I think it doubtful that anyone on a New York City street would have
rushed to the assistance of a stranger. Thank you Glasgow!

A GLITTERING array of young stars streamed across the stage of
Aberdeen's Music Hall on Sunday night, a marathon evening in the city's
International Youth Festival.
Seven young musicians -- every one of them brilliant, and each a
former winner of the annual Skene Aberdeen Festival Award -- were
brought back to Aberdeen by the company who sponsored their early
success to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the award in a gala concert
where they were accompanied by the Camerata Scotland, the chamber
orchestra of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, and conductor
Julian Clayton.
Every style was represented: from the suave and polished playing in
Haydn's Trumpet Concerto by Scot Tracey Redfern, the sheer wizardy,
grainy sound, and mindblowing articulation of Polish oboist Marek
Mleczko in Francaix's L'Horloge de Flore, and the magically sensitive
viol in playing of Canadian Kai Gleusteen in Vaughan Williams's The Lark
Ascending -- one of the best performances I've ever heard of this one.
The coup was putting four of the prizewinners together in Haydn's
Sinfonia Concertante, which, from an uncomfortable start, developed into
an assured performance with the extroversion of a jam session.
Accompanying stoically and expertly all night, the Camerata -- the
elite corps of young Scottish musicians -- had their own chance to shine
in Edward Harper's sizzling string masterpiece, The Fiddler of the
Reels, conducted by the composer and played with the grit and bite of
Bartok, and Edward McGuire's dark-tinged Fiddler's Farewell. Superb
concert.

Aberdeen Friends of Camerata Scotland.

THE cleverness of your columnist, Jack McLean, in the journalistic
role he has chosen for himself is not in question; at times, the wisdom
of his writing is.
The gross discourtesy of his opening paragraph (August 4) is
indefensible. It brings shame to the writer and The Herald.

TO a certain extent we agree with Alex Salmond's hypothesis that the
Labour Party cannot be trusted on the constitution (August 2), but it is
all a bit rich coming from a man whose party's sole purpose is to split
Scotland away from the rest of the UK and thereby plunge us into
economic ruin.
It is clear that many of the forward-thinking Labour Party members and
MPs are beginning to see devolution for what it really is -- a total
unnecessary nonsense.
Labour has already decided against any form of devolution for the
English regions, and we believe that if it wasn't for its fear of the
SNP it would rule it out in Scotland also.
As Conservatives we believe in less government and bureaucracy, not
more. We believe that individuals should decide for themselves what is
best for them and their families, not government.
We believe that local government should be responsive to the needs of
local communities. And we believe that national government should spend
less of our money, not more.
These beliefs are totally incompatible with devolution.
In the long term the only people to benefit from Labour's devolution
proposals for Scotland will be Alex Salmond and the SNP.

WRITING on the current orgy of argument on Jacobitism on this 250th
anniversary of the '45, Michael Fry admits his own part in it as
''director of the major academic conference on the subject, organised by
the Eighteenth-Century Scottish Society at the University of Aberdeen
this week'' (August 2).
I am more than happy to agree that he and the ECSSS were responsible
for much of the academic planning but in fact the conference was
promoted by the University of Aberdeen as part of a series in the
university's Quincentenary celebrations, co-directed by Joan Pittock
Wesson for the university and by Michael Fry for the ECSSS whose annual
conference this was, and managed by the Association for Scottish
Literary Studies under its general manager, Catherine McInerney.
The conference ran in tandem with the fifth International Scott
Conference which also had Jacobitism as its theme, was also promoted by
the university and managed by the ASLS, and directed by J H Alexander
and myself.
It was a marvellous conjunction of anniversaries, and of academic
organisations concerned with the interdisciplinary analysis of a key
movement in Scotland's past: but it was a co-operative endeavour.

IF Edinburgh-based composer Lyell Cresswell didn't exist, they'd have
to invent him. Faced nearly a year ago with a BBC commission for a new
concerto for the unlikely pairing of accordion and symphony orchestra (a
job Cresswell reckoned nobody else would touch or tackle) he set about
it with two things: his unique imagination and a vengeance.
The results, unveiled in a London Prom last night with the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra, its associate conductor Martyn Brabbins,
and accordion wizard James Crabb all in spectacular form, were little
short of amazing. Cresswell transformed the humble squeeze-box into
everything from an ominously heaving leviathan to a trapeze artist.
Subtitled Dragspil -- the Icelandic for accordion -- the concerto is
nothing short of a Cresswell epic, half an hour of mosaic drama, beauty,
and sheer hijinks. Over the span of three movements, Cresswell sets a
huge musical juggernaut in motion: its first movement is initially deep,
throaty, dark, slow, and cumbersome, building through characteristic
walls of brass sound and increasingly virtuosic accordion writing to an
almost frantic pace before winding down again.
For a slow movement, Cresswell has produced some of his most beautiful
and luminous writing, with slow cascades of technicolour string sound
(the soloist seems to have a lesser role here) before nervy cackling and
aggressive rhythm take over. In an uproarious finale, all hell breaks
loose: brass snarl, strings yelp and screech as the accordion becomes an
acrobat -- diving, soaring, cartwheeling, pirouetting, and chuntering
all over the colour spectrum at high speed. Brilliant piece, and a
brilliant performance of almost hilarious virtuosity.

ON the evidence of the first three days, this year's jazz festival
should be carrying a Government health warning. Not only did the outdoor
events mean that sunstroke was an occupational hazard but the mixed bag
of bands on offer meant that in order to partake of some really
worthwhile music, eardrums had to be subjected to the utter torment of
noisy salsa outfits, boring Belgian trad-men and dreary Danish
Dixielanders.
Sweden and France saved the weekend -- with a little help from their
friends. The Swedish Jazz Kings took up their roving residency on Sunday
during the Jazz On a Summer's Day extravaganza. The sizzling trumpeting
twosome of their Australian guest Bob Barnard and Sweden's greatest jazz
export, the unfortunately-named Bent Persson, undoubtedly boosted the
temperature up a few notches.
This regal bunch play in a raw 1920s style, much-influenced by Louis
Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven bands. On Sunday, Barnard dipped into
the Armstrong repertoire to perform staggering solo versions of West End
Blues and Cornet Chop Suey which were magnificent and majestic in a way
that owed nothing to imitation. Barnard's eloquent lyricism complemented
perfectly the rougher sound of the Swedes, although it seemed that the
equally talented Persson had been relegated to the sidelines --
hopefully more will be heard from him tonight.

AS the first stirrings of the Edinburgh Festival are seen on the
streets, here's a last-minute chance to catch up with an old Fringe
favourite.
The Reduced Shakespeare Company, a trio of zippy Americans, has been
turning out its miniature epics since 1987. Like the two-man National
Theatre of Brent, it specialises in improbable performances of the
impossible and, after a two-night helping of Shakespeare (finishing
tonight), it'll move on to the Assembly Rooms to essay the Complete
History of America (Abridged).
The Shakespeare show is a predictably silly and frequently inspired
attempt on every play plus the sonnets, and ranges from relatively
lengthy versions of Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet to lightning gags in
which 16 plays are dealt with at a stroke.
The humour is more often bawdy than brainy (though there's no question
that these guys know what they're doing) and relies as often as not on
blunt anachronisms as in: ''There are more things in heaven and earth,
Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy -- so piss off.''
But in a way, this show has less to do with Shakespeare than it has
with street theatre, where the group's origins lie. The three of them,
Adam Long, David Letwin, and Matthew Henrickson, are exceptionally
physical performers, and you can see very clearly their
crowd-controlling techniques, the broad knock-about humour, the mix of
genres, and the moments of spontaneity that must have sustained them
outdoors.
There's still room in this well-worn script for topical references to
Brookside, Kurt Cobain and Hugh Grant, and their handling of a wayward
audience volunteer last night was a hoot.
Now for the Festival proper.

Sara Villiers looks at the timing of a resonant Irish play's new run
and finds why its plot about valour and the terror of war will endure.
JULY 12, 1995: On the streets of Belfast the drums of the Orange Walk
are thundering with messianic zeal. And in Dublin, an Ulsterman's drum
is being beaten with the same righteous fury -- on the main stage of the
Abbey Theatre, where a new run of Frank McGuinness's Observe the Sons of
Ulster Marching Towards the Somme which the Abbey revived last year, is
opening.
Each cacophonous bang reverberates with the weight of associations and
sets the audiences' spines-a-tingle. Bang! with pride, bang! with
defensiveness. Bang! with fear.
The timing could not be more resonant; on a day which symbolically
encapsulates Ireland's bitter history of sectarianism, a day which pays
homage to quasi-mythical past events, here is a play which deals
courageously with the ghosts of the past, which implodes many myths --
although it reinforces some, viz that the Ulstermen wore sashes as they
went into battle at the Somme -- offers new insights and provides an
emotional amplification of the present situation through a dramatisation
of the past.
Patrick Mason, artistic director at the Abbey and director of this
production, says he had not timed the opening intentionally although he
concedes that when it became obvious that the play was scheduled for
July ''there could be no other date''.
He has a personal connection to the play, having directed the original
production at the Abbey in 1985, and he still evokes a sense of wonder
as he recalls that debut. ''There was a feeling of a quite extraordinary
play being born and the arrival of a very extraordinary writer, and I
think the intervening years have borne that out.''
The play arrived amid considerable controversy. That McGuinness, a
Northern Irish Catholic writer from a Nationalist background, should
choose as his subject the predominantly Protestant 36th (Ulster)
Division of World War One seemed astonishing. That these men's beliefs
and devotion to their Loyalist cause should be dramatised as dignified
at a time when the community was demonised by many factions caused
outrage in Dublin -- and even counter blasts from Protestant groups
suspicious of being caricatured.
Despite these difficulties and initial reservations the play was a
great hit. In dramatising the Irish experience of the First World War it
had no theatrical precedent. Some 350,000 Irishmen enlisted in the Great
War but with so many Catholic families this was a hushed-up affair.
McGuinness's play unsentimentally presents the valour and real terrors
of all the men who fought that war; it has a cathartic effect. It
touched people's lives in deeply meaningful ways.
That cathartic power was intensified in last year's production, which
was triggered by the announcement of the IRA's ceasefire. ''We had to do
the play again because it speaks very immediately to this island and
what is going on here,'' says Mason. ''On the night we previewed in the
autumn the Loyalist ceasefire was announced so on the opening night we
were able to invite a lot of people from Belfast, Derry and Enniskillen.
It was an extraordinary evening.
''The play celebrates very deep human emotions, like pity and love and
humour, good humour, but it is also an extraordinary lament. We don't
have many ways of grieving publicly, grieving communally, and that night
became one of both celebration and grief, and that is the sign of great
theatre,'' says Mason.
For those reasons he is convinced that McGuinness's play will endure.
The opening scene bridges the generation gap, as a dying old man,
Kenneth Pyper, still guilt-stricken that he was his company's sole
survivor in the Somme carnage, is haunted by remembrance of his seven
former comrades-in-arms. In a stunning coup-de-theatre he is visited by
their ghosts, silently encouraging him to expound their experience, to
explain ''why we let ourselves be led into extermination''. It is a task
that he rails against -- ''I am angry that you demand that I continue to
probe'' -- but eventually accepts, plunging us into a drama which makes
us witnesses to the rituals of war; initiation, pairing and bonding.
This is stirring theatre which is unafraid of being emotive.
McGuinness charts the intertwining relationships of the eight men with
beguilingly simple language but complex inferences, every
characterisation has a flipside.
Bravery, passion, cowardice, love or bravery; all are dramatically
quizzed. The central character of Pyper is a remarkable creation; a
maverick who revels in a black-sheep image, a quixotic mixture of
campery and brawn, who flaunts conventions and dons his sash reluctantly
but who walks bravely into battle.
''I think what is the mark of the play's great strength is that you go
on a long journey with these eight men and it is part of McGuinness's
great humanity that in the end you weep for them, you admire their
courage and their love,'' says Mason.
He's pleased that the Abbey is returning to the International Festival
for a second year and after their '94 production of Synge's The Well of
the Saints with a very different play. ''The Abbey is obviously deeply
associated with Synge and his plays but the other part of their work is
in creating a contemporary repertoire and I think this is one of the
finest and most challenging plays that we have in the contemporary Irish
repertoire.''
Asked if he sees McGuinness's drama as integral to Irish culture and
sense of identity he concurs absolutely. ''It's not going to change the
world but it touches something very, very important. If you believe in
the force of imagination, if you believe in the restorative powers of
emotions, it's a start, isn't it? It's a new vision.''
* Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, Edinburgh
International Festival, King's Theatre, August 18-23.

ALLAN LAING speaks to the cast of an old-fashioned love story set in
Glasgow.
ALFRED Molina, Fred to his mates, must be the first man ever in the
history of the World to sit in a carpet warehouse in Springburn --
albeit a dark and disused one -- wearing only a silk dressing gown for
comfort. The things actors will do for art's sake.
Molina, one of Britain's finest character actors, has never filmed in
Glasgow before. But he knows a bit about the city. Perhaps that is why,
when you introduce yourself as the chap from The Herald, he doesn't say
''What Herald?'' No, with a breathtaking grasp of the regional newspaper
scene, he says ''Ah, Scotland's only independent newspaper!'' A nice
touch.
For the purposes of an ambitious new television film being made by BBC
Scotland, this damp and dingy old warehouse has been transformed into
(a) a bijou basement flat in a fashionable area of London, and (b) the
kitchen of a respectable working-class house in Glasgow.
As a mostly Scottish film crew busily prepare the set for the next
take, two of them privately discuss Molina's contribution so far.
Refreshingly, it seems that there are no sides to him. None of the
''I'm-the-star'' crap you get from others. He's a nice man, a really
nice man who's friendly and helpful and straight as an arrow. In short,
he's user-friendly and a joy to work with.
With a track record like his, it could all be so different. He could
almost be forgiven for being a ''been there, seen it, done it'' kind of
bloke. Powerful performances in films which have seen him reincarnate
tragic comic Tony Hancock, tortured musician John Ogden, and playwright
Joe Orton's jealous lover, Kenneth Halliwell; a hit ITV series with El
Cid; and more recently a handful of villainous roles in Hollywood have
all served to make him an actor of international renown. But here he is
in Springburn to play a gay lover in Nervous Energy, a 90-minute TV
movie being made for BBC2.
It's strength (apart from a superb cast which also features Annette
Crosbie, Iain Glenn, Siobhan Redmond, and young Scots actor Cal
Macaninch) is in its script. It is a belter. Seriously witty, enormously
moving, it is essentially an old-fashioned love story about two men, one
of whom is suffering from Aids.
And yet it is not about Aids. Indeed, it is not really about a gay
relationship. It is about the universal problem, experienced by all who
leave the nest to start a new life in another place, of working out
where your family loyalties lie. Is it with the mother and father,
perhaps the siblings, you left behind? Or is it with those with whom you
choose to settle anew? Home is where the heart is -- but where is the
heart when it's at home?
Tom (Macaninch), a young Glaswegian living in London, realises he is
dying from Aids and decides to return home in a bid to come to terms
with the family and friends who rejected him. But, like many Aids
sufferers, he is possessed by excessive, often almost manic behaviour
pattern (a nervous energy), and his family find it difficult to cope. It
is left to his lover, Ira (Molina), an American radio journalist based
in London, to head north and pick up the pieces.
The film -- which, despite its somewhat sobering subject matter, is
filled with the amusement of reality -- was written by Howard Schuman,
the American exile in London who wrote Rock Follies, Selling Hitler, and
is currently the writer and presenter of BBC2's Moving Pictures.
Nervous Energy could be set anywhere, of course. But Schuman
specifically chose Glasgow because he is familiar with, and holds a
genuine affection for, the city. The result is a script which captures
with acute precision the nuances of the language and the distinctive
humour of the city.
But, in addition, Glasgow is a particularly apt backdrop, given its
outdated Presbyterian attitudes and downright hypocrisy when it comes to
homosexuality. We are a city of heterosexual hardmen, after all, and
your typical working-class family would find it more difficult than most
to come to terms with the fact that their son or brother was, not only
gay, but also dying from Aids.
Schuman says: ''There is an element of Presbyterianism in it, I
suppose. There's a scene where Tom and his father finally touch each
other; hold each other. It is a very powerful scene because Scots are
not tactile and the father is resentful.''
Molina was attracted to the part solely on the strength of Schuman's
script. He liked the way it takes you on a whole roller-coaster ride of
emotions, from the comical and even farcical to the touching and the
tragic.
He explains: ''It concerns itself with Aids only in so far as Aids is
the backdrop in front of which this story of relationships is played
out. It's really a love story; it doesn't pretend to be a polemic.
''If you are going to do a story about the relationship between two
people of the same sex, particularly gay men, you can't avoid mentioning
Aids because it is such an important and serious element of life.
''One of the great things I love about this film is that it is not in
the least bit depressing. It is very affirmative. It doesn't end with
Tom's death -- although obviously he is going to die. It actually ends
with him regaining his respect.''
The film offers 27-year-old Cal Macaninch his biggest role to date.
Having served the obligatory television apprenticeship (with appearances
in Taggart), he came to prominence in BBC1's offbeat drama series, The
Riff Raff Element, and more recently as an East End gangster in the ITV
mini-series Dangerous Lady.
Delighted to be back in his home town (he was brought up in Cathcart),
Macininch says: ''It's one of the best scripts I've ever read. What I
got from it, being an exile away from Scotland, was the need to come
home and find your roots at a moment of emotional vulnerability.''
He sees parallels with his own life, not so much with his own family,
but with his friends.
''That has always been a bit strange and being an actor doesn't help.
It is difficult to come back and make the connections because I am not
the same and neither are they. Everyone changes and you have to make
adjustments,'' he adds.
* Nervous Energy will be screened on BBC2 around Christmas time.

I REFER to Ken Gallagher's report concerning the pleas by Celtic
shareholders for Brian Dempsey's ''comeback''. Who are these alleged
people?
As a comparatively successful businessman in the city and a major
shareholder of Celtic I would like to remind Ken Gallagher that Fergus
McCann rescued a fast-sinking ship some 18 months ago by injecting a
fortune of his own money into the club. This year, and within six
months, the shares have risen by 25%. Lucky me, or wise commercial
judgment?
Players O'Donnell, Van Hooydonk, McKinley, and Thom have been bought
and, despite a season spent in the wilderness of Hampden Park, Celtic
have been in the final of the Coca Cola Cup and won the Scottish Cup.
The atmosphere and enthusiasm at Parkhead is now a joy to witness.
Let Fergus McCann get on with the job. Football needs men like this,
and they should be given support and encouragement.

Marsha Hunt tells how daughter Karis triggered her mission to
encourage black British-born writers -- a crusade that reaches a finale
at the Edinburgh Book Festival this weekend
PEOPLE who read the tabloids may think that the only thing I did in my
life was have an affair with Mick Jagger. Actually I write books, act,
and used to sing, which is how we met. That we have a daughter continues
to intrigue the press. Her name is Karis. She's 24, smart, knows
everything about me and a lot about theatre, which is why the film-maker
Lindsay Anderson said Karis would be the best person to direct me in a
one-woman dramatisation of my novel Joy at last year's Edinburgh
Festival.
Though Karis was born and raised in London she moved to San Francisco
after graduating from Yale, but we decided that our house in northern
France where I write would be the ideal place to rehearse Joy. Of course
we were putting our very good relationship at risk when we agreed to do
this project together, because we're both headstrong and for a daughter
to direct her mother could cause greater stress than normally exists
between an actress and director. But one of the things which balances
our relationship is that she's English and I'm American. I can depend
upon her to underplay her emotions and resist shouting at all costs.
She attended the same boarding school that Princess Margaret chose for
her children, and despite my ghetto beginnings in Philadelphia and
Jagger's upper-working-class upbringing in Dartford, our daughter has
the markings of an English public school. She harbours her emotions and
appears calm and understated when I have smoke coming out of my ears.
That's why I knew she could direct me.
When she arrived in France to begin our work together, I picked her up
at Charles De Gaulle airport, claiming that I was on the verge of a
nervous breakdown. She knows I exaggerate so maybe she thought it wasn't
quite so dramatic. But I was definitely suffering from a combination of
writer's cramp, cabin fever, and combat fatigue after months of work on
my fourth book, Repossessing Ernestine, which had me at my typewriter 15
hours a day, seven days a week. I was still nowhere near completion and
had to admit that I'd only just begun the adaptation of Joy for our
production.
She was sitting in the passenger seat with her Macintosh laptop by her
feet and took the news calmly. I knew that she had expected me to
already know my lines, so hearing that the adaptation wasn't complete
must have come as a shock. She was making her directorial debut at the
Festival and I was more anxious than she that things would go well.
That laptop at her feet was to play a starring role in the upcoming
weeks, because we worked together on the adaptation and the piece
benefited from her innate editorial skills. Rightfully, she gets half
the credit. I was 39 before I wrote my first book and it was exciting to
think that my daughter was exhibiting a natural writing skill at 23. I
said: ''You're a writer and you've got a keen sense of story line. You
ought to be writing books.''
While she was studying at Yale she had introduced me to the work of
Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston and bought me Toni
Morrison's Beloved. So in turn, while we were working in France, I
wanted to turn her on to some black British novelists. But I couldn't
think of any who like her had been born in Britain or Ireland.
Black novelists like Ben Okri, born in Nigeria, Caryl Phillips, born
in St Kitts, Merle Collins, born in Grenada, may live in Britain and
have been largely influenced by it. But murmurs from their countries of
origin must affect how they view the world. I wanted to introduce my
daughter to a black British or Irish-born writer and couldn't think of
any.
So I gave her some Walter Mosley, saying: ''Walter's black and
American. Don't be put off because President Clinton recommended him . .
.'' But the notion that there was a distinct absence of black
British-born novelists niggled me and I didn't get a chance to air my
complaint until Simon Albury, the director of public relations at
Meridian Television, rang me in France to ask if I would front a
writers' workshop at the Kent Literature Festival which Meridian was
sponsoring on October 1.
Simon has been a friend since we both were presenters at London's
Capital Radio in the early seventies. His wife is part-Ghanaian and
their five-year-old son David, like Karis, is mixed race and born in
London. So I didn't mince my words: ''A writers' workshop seems
premature. What I'd rather do is set up a forum to ask why there aren't
any black British writers, because there doesn't seem to be any, despite
Britain's great literary tradition. I'm not interested in doing a black
writers' workshop, because it may be more pertinent to invite a panel to
answer the question 'Where is the Black Voice of Britain?' ''
With Karis's help, and the miracle of faxes, Simon and I developed the
basis for a four-hour forum whereby I could invite a panel of speakers
from London's book world, writers, editors, and publishers to discuss
the problem and pose solutions.
I told Simon: ''We don't want this to be one of those beef sessions
where we bore an audience to death complaining about race and politics
that seem insoluble and drift into every issue that's grown out of
slavery. So let me choose the panel and I'll try to come up with some
good talkers. But I can't deal with any of it until Karis and I get Joy
on stage in Edinburgh, because I still don't know my lines and we open
there in four weeks.''
The gods were kind and our production of Joy ran for a successful
three weeks in the little Wildman Rooms so brilliantly run by William
Burdett Coutts's team that oversees all the shows in the Assembly Rooms.
Once I'd settled into the routine of performing every day at noon and
fitting in press calls afterwards, I was able to concentrate on setting
up that panel to discuss why there has been an absence of black, British
writers and what could be done to correct it.
It took a lot of phone calls and a lot of explaining, because the
people I talked to, both black and white, didn't understand why I wanted
to differentiate between writers who were born in Liverpool or Glasgow
say, as opposed to Kingston, Jamaica, or Lagos, Nigeria. Everybody is so
blinded by skin colour that they fail to see how much nationality
affects individuals and affects the voice of individuals who write.
Maybe my being an American who has raised a daughter in England makes
me more sensitive to this. I saw that despite my American presence in
our household, Karis is wholly English. Pork sausages and Marmite were
her staples, like hot dogs and hamburgers were mine.
The grey sky over London, wellington boots and cricket, her
comprehension of Shakespeare, her manner and manners are related to her
British birth. She can adopt America but Britain is her home, in the
same way that I can adopt Britain but am essentially American.
Karis didn't come to that forum at the Kent Literature Festival,
because after our stint in Edinburgh, she was eager to get back to San
Francisco. But I was thinking about her and others like her who have an
African ancestor, yet can only identify Britain or Ireland as home.
The panel I invited included Steve Pope, a co-publisher of X-Press,
Britain's most successful black publishing house, and Margaret Busby,
the editor of Daughters of Africa, an anthology of black women writers
from around the world. Tony Fairweather, who runs a marketing company
for black writers called The Write Thing, also joined us and John
Saddler, editorial director of Flamingo, an imprint of HarperCollins,
gave up his free Saturday to come speak. So did Ray Shell,
African-American author of ICED and the actor Hugh Quarshie.
Andrea Levy was the only black British-born novelist that I could find
for the panel. She'd just had her first book published and was nervous
about talking to the 100 or so in the audience which included people
from the media, radio, and TV.
One person I'd asked to come who couldn't make it was Pauline Black,
the singer with the band Selecter, who is also an actress and
broadcaster. I'd especially wanted her to be there because she'd written
her first novel and, despite her marketable profile (Selecter at their
peak in the seventies had a hit with Three Minute Hero), she couldn't
get her manuscript read by any of the major publishers. Pauline's father
was Nigerian, her mother English, but she was adopted by a working-class
couple in Romford.
I couldn't imagine that her novel about five mixed-race students in
Coventry wouldn't make compelling reading. It filled 487 pages and I
brought it to the forum in case there were people in the audience who
had never seen a manuscript. I also talked about her unsuccessful
attempt to find an agent or publisher and couldn't help wondering
whether a blonde, blue-eyed pop star, TV presenter and radio host would
have had the trouble Pauline had had just trying to find somebody to
read her work.
My own first book was an autobiography commissioned by Chatto and
Windus who may have had hopes that I would write a kiss-and-tell
featuring Mick Jagger. But I resisted that and ghost writers, because I
knew my story could have been exploited for the wrong reasons.
Publishers want to make money and the consensus drawn from that forum
I'd set up was that until publishers can see the fiscal advantage of
signing up black British-born writers they won't bother. So I tried to
think of what I could do to encourage writing among a sector which is
grossly under-represented on the bookshelves. A book prize seemed the
answer so I set about to create one after the forum.
It sounds pompous and even a little ridiculous to say that I've
created a literary prize. But I was forced to because some incentive was
needed for black British-born writers. So despite being somewhat
embarrassed about it, I'm also chuffed that The SAGA Prize exists.
With the combined efforts of the Saga Group, Virago Press, Book Trust,
and our three wonderful judges -- Margaret Busby, Lennie Goodings, and
Steve Pope -- a miracle has happened. We not only have The SAGA Prize,
we also have our first SAGA Prize winner -- who will be announced on
Sunday at the Edinburgh Book Festival.
Only 10 months ago, there was no prize and without the early
enthusiasm of Karis Jagger, Simon Albury, Carmen Callil, and Roger de
Haan it would have been impossible for me to have forged ahead with this
project at such speed. But they weren't the only ones who helped and I
can't begin to list everyone, because there have been hundreds of
well-wishers who have given their support in various ways.
The SAGA prizewinner will be announced during the event, The First
Time, at 6.30pm on Sunday in the Post Office Tent, Charlotte Square
Gardens. If you're in Edinburgh, please come along.

I RECENTLY returned from an exciting trip to Russia where my friend
and I had been invited to judge and demonstrate at a floral art seminar.
We were based in Moscow and the ladies who attended the seminar had
travelled from Siberia, the Volga region, the Ukraine, and other parts
of the country.
Being anxious to promote Glasgow, and our fellow Glaswegians, we had
packed in our bags balloons, pencils, carrier bags, etc, all bearing the
Glasgow Smiles Better logo.
During one of our demonstrations these items were produced and were
warmly received by the audience but what really brought the house down
were the little yellow, furry ''bugs'' -- immediately known as Mr Happy.
These were borne off in triumph by our audience. Imagine our surprise
the next day to find that every car in the Palace of Culture car-park
was proudly bearing a Mr Happy Glasgow Smiles Better ''bug''.
If you happen to be in Russia this summer and see a car bearing our
Glasgow logo ''bug'', you will know how it got there!

NEWS of East Ayrshire Council, the unitary authority formed from the
parts of the Land o' Burns which the Tories did not want to be in the
former Kyle and Carrick bit they thought they would win in the last
local elections. (See under best laid plans of mice and men.)
The East Ayrshire Council headquarters has been established in London
Road, Kilmarnock, and it boasts not one but two rooms with padded walls
and two-way mirrors. Nothing to do with the expected behaviour of the
elected members of East Ayrshire, we are told.
The building used to be a secondary school which was equipped with the
rooms to deal with difficult and unruly pupils who needed to be calmed
down in times of severe stress. But you never know.
Sparra spotters
THESPIANS, literati, and people with fond memories of Duncan Macrae
gathered in Edinburgh last night to launch a biography of the Scots
actor whose talents and appeal ranged from high theatre to lowish
humour.
The book, Wise Enough to Play the Fool (John Donald, #14.95) is a
thorough tome, verging on the academic, which relates the great man's
life. The account of Mr Macrae's substantial impact on Scottish theatre
will be analysed by others better qualified so to do.
The Diary will concentrate for the moment on the song The Wee Cock
Sparra which Mr Macrae made extremely popular and which made him a
household name in Scotland when he sang it on December 31, 1959, on the
BBC Hogmanay show. The song, as most of you will remember, is about a
wee boy who abused a sparra with a bow and an arra. There ensued a
debate about whether a passing adult should have remonstrated in a
physical way with the boy even though he wasn't his farra.
Duncan Macrae, at this point in his career, had played many major
roles at the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow, on stage in London, in films
such as Whisky Galore, and on TV, with the lead role in the first-ever
series of Para Handy, but it was the Wee Cock Sparra which endeared him
most of all to his ain folk.
The song was released on disc, as it was then called, and became the
party piece of many a drunk Scotsman at Hogmanay. Duncan Macrae came
eventually to loathe the song.
So central is this piece of low-brow music to Macrae's life that the
biographer, Priscilla Barlow, begins her book with a prologue entitled
''Not just a sparrow''. The biography states that the origin of the Wee
Cock Sparra song is not clear. Macrae may have learnt it at school in
Finnieston or it may have been adapted from the work of another Glasgow
theatrical.
Any early cock sparra sightings to the Diary at the usual address.
Bank's robbery
WE have become accustomed to the banks charging for sending letters to
customers. The Aitkenhead family of Crosslee, Johnstone, report that the
Clydesdale Bank has taken this usury even further by sending them a
letter on which they had to pay 26p excess postage. The communication
consisted of unsolicited bumf urging the Aitkenheads to borrow a sum
from #500 to #15,000 for any purpose. Have a holiday, buy a car, pay
your bank charges.
The Name Game
MANAGING director of Related Fluids Ltd of Cupar is a Mr Jonathan
Spittle. The finance director of Manchester United is a Mr Launders. A
fire-place shop in Edinburgh is called Hearth of Midlothian.
The netwidens
THE Diary is now on the Internet, which is good news and bad news. The
good news is that we now get cheery messages from Scots exiles such as
Roy Hay in Australia who writes: ''Help ma Boab, civilisation has come
to Geelong. I can get the Herald Diary on Internet. No longer do I have
to rely on my mother in Minishant sending me the book of the series for
Christmas.''
The bad news is that sales of the Tom Shields Diary and Tom Shields
Too (both Mainstream #7.99; both still available in good bookshops) will
surely suffer as folk go electronic. But can you read the Internet in
the toilet, that's what we say.
Mr Hay tells us he heard an SNP person being interviewed on Australian
radio on the subject of Scottish independence and feels constrained to
write: ''I cannot conceive of these large territorial units like
Ayrshire, far less Scotland. When Carrick gets its independence, I
intend to return home and join the Maybole Separatist Movement. Can you
put me in touch with their leaders?''
We agree with Mr Hay and would go further to say that we will not rest
until Minishant is free.
Scenes of confusion
NEWS from Canada, via Diary reader Tom Campbell of Edinburgh. His chum
over by has been to see Braveheart, Mel Gibson's movie about William
Wallace. He is very impressed but, as a Celtic supporter, is wondering
how certain aspects of the film will go down over here. He is talking
about the bits before the battle scenes when the Scots patriots paint
their faces blue and, before the bloody action commences, are seen to
cross themselves.
Let it Bleet
DEFINITELY the last time (until the next time) that we use this old
joke. Bill McKechnie of Falkirk asks if when Runrig support the Rolling
Stones in concert in Germany, will they play their great hit Hey,
McLeod, Get Offa My Ewe?
Straight as a dye
BAD news for Rangers fans who got their Gazza bleached blond haircut
at one of the cheaper salons. There is a worrying incidence reported of
the hair turning green. Even worse news for those who have the haircut
and are of a homophobic disposition. The blond crew cut has been adopted
by certain elements of the London gay community as a statement about
their sexual orientation.

ANVAR KHAN'S article on some very different social problems was out of
place (July 29). The journalism was lazy and mediocre, comprising a
predictable list of reactionary and ignorant prejudices about a number
of complex and separate though related issues.
Personal responsibility for individual behaviour is to be encouraged.
However, its use as an all-inclusive response to complex social issues
such as theft, drug abuse, and alcoholism, is extremely limited.

HOW very disappointing to read the rather condescending reply to my
letter (July 28) from J Arnold, director of New Lanark Trust (August 1).
The real object of my letter was to draw other rail travellers'
attention to the difficulties of finding the direction, never mind the
route to New Lanark. We were quite happy to walk, but which way, and how
far?
One little point he did get wrong, Glaswegian accent I have not. I
hail from a Fairer City both rural and leafy.

THE greatest single thing about the Edinburgh Festival is that it
provides an opportunity to take creative risks: nowhere else can you
take a new show to a venue and work it in every night for three weeks,
with thousands of people wandering around whose principal desire is to
be an audience.
Stage one of preparing for Edinburgh is to remind myself constantly of
that: only go if you've got a show that is intrinsically interesting,
somehow experimental, somehow stretching you. Because as soon as you
start conceiving of something experimental, something that stretches
you, Performer's Vanity comes into play.
By definition, if you're taking a risk, there's always the chance that
it won't work and word-of-mouth will guarantee your potential audience
goes elsewhere, leaving you depressed, humiliated and broke. The thought
of spending three weeks seeing all your friends and colleagues
pretending not to notice you because they know you're bombing, is not
pleasant. But you have to fight the Voice of Caution.
Last time I did the Festival, in 1993, I took a risk with The Ghost of
John Belushi Flushed My Toilet and it paid off. The show was a
progression from conventional stand-up. It had a structure and a
narrative thread; it wasn't all funny, wasn't intended to be. It worked.
In theory, this should give me more confidence for the next project. In
reality -- the next step in Edinburgh preparation is anxiety: what if
Belushi was just a one-off?
There follows the next crucial step -- Someone Starts Hassling You. In
March, my promoter starts calling: ''Deadline for the Festival's coming
up -- when are we going to see that outline you promised?'' Oh God . . .
smoking increases; inertia sets in at the prospect of knowing you can't
really waste a single waking minute; the guilt caused by spending most
of a day putting off what suddenly seem like unpostponable household
chores weighs down so heavily that every evening you need a drink to
relax, just one, mind, and at 11.30 you finally sit down to write with
enough coffee . . . well, to keep a semi-drunken writer awake all night,
scribbling on bits of paper What Am I Going To Do?
Then, suddenly, somehow, a spark, for which I have Virginia Bottomley
to thank. I'm in a lift at the BBC and, as the doors are about to close,
the then Health Secretary rushes up and says: ''Oh, is there room?''
What did I do? Did I wait until she was trapped and then punch her
lights out? No. I said: ''Yes, there's plenty of room. But you'll never
get out alive.'' And everyone else laughed, but Virginia waited for the
next lift. I went for the gag, disgusting myself: I had the chance to
act, and I didn't.
OK, I would have been nicked, but -- just maybe -- at the trial I
could have conveyed some sense of who I am -- you know, deranged perhaps
but lucid; educated, wishy-washy liberal with it, and -- maybe, just
maybe -- she'd have thought: ''People like that are punching me out in
lifts? We are messing up really badly.''
So at a little personal cost -- what, three years inside? -- I could
have done something. Ineffectual and crazy perhaps, but maybe not.
Instead, however, I went for the gag. So when it comes to the crunch,
what kind of selfish, spineless poseur am I, and how dare I try and kid
myself or anyone else otherwise?
Now, that may sound preposterous, but I see in this gap between
thought and deed some kind of moral dilemma. More importantly, I also
wonder who this violent lunatic inhabiting my body is.
Next step, arranging a couple of try-outs -- running it in front of an
audience. The Voice of Caution tells me: ''This stuff is really
offensive. Don't do it.'' I do it. People are offended. A close friend
slaps me round the face afterwards. Another couple tell me they felt
they'd been kicked in the guts. But also that they all laughed a lot . .
. hmm . . . I must be on to something.
So somehow Liberal Psychotic has spun out into, well, a show that I'm
longing to try out for three weeks every night at the only place you
can.
I've never been more confident or excited about an Edinburgh Show than
this time. How will it go down? Who knows? But you never will unless you
try it. Take the risk. Sometimes the risk will fail. So what? Just
please don't let it be this time. And if it doesn't work, well, at least
you can always get a drink.
* Nick Revell will be turning Liberal Psychotic nightly at 6pm at the
Assembly Rooms.

Glasgow Green will become a giant playground tomorrow and Jennifer
Cunningham checks out what's in store
TOMORROW is playday. Playday '95, to be precise, a nationwide fest of
frolics, the biggest and best example of which will be on Glasgow Green,
according to city's parks and recreation department.
They are hoping that 10,000 children will follow the pied pipers (of
course there's more than one; this is Glasgow, not Hamelin) to Glasgow
Green, where there will not only be bread and circuses, but arts,
crafts, sports and toys of all sorts from the latest technological
wizardry to girds and cleeks.
This third Glasgow Playday is designed for five to 12-year-olds, but
wee brothers and sisters and mums and dads are all welcome to join in
the fun whether in the sand pit, and soft play areas for under-fives,
kite-flying or getting seriously to grips with this year's theme of
communications.
Stuart Douglas, as community recreation children's play officer, one
of the few grown men who cheerfully admits they are paid to play, is
chief organiser. He argues that while countless small towns will have
their own events, economies of scale -- the council has budgeted for
#10,000 -- means that they have some of the biggest names in play. They
are not to be confused with children's entertainers and other conjuring
tricks. Activity, participation and interaction are the buzz-words,
allied to the communications theme.
Remember, this is serious, hands-on learning through experience
stimulation for the TV generation whose passivity concerns their
couch-potato parents and teachers, as well as causing serious alarm to
sociologists. Only those of an age beyond parental interference can T in
the Park with impunity. These days, children have to earn their
ice-lollies.
Chief troubadour is Ian Smith, who ran away not to, but from, the
circus. When Circus Archaos went bust, mid-tour, in Toronto, ringmaster
Smith and wife headed for Mexico. From there, apparently, it was but a
small step to the Arches in Glasgow and Cafe Loco, where fritters were
dramatic spatterings, salads salcious, and curry a spicy performance.
Now his small troupe, Mischief La Bas, specialises in spreading fun
for small people. Tomorrow, as a walking example of communication, he
will be Town Crier, urging all to roll up for the fun, but in a manner
which seems likely to owe more to the jester tradition than the
solemn-faced bell-ringer.
His assistants will be pied pipers with the patter and he promises
that thenceforth not a rat nor a mouse shall venture so much as a
whisker on Glasgow Green.
Television arts and crafts guru, Tony Hart, will declare the Green
open for play at 11am and will construct a giant picture. Teams from
summer play-schemes around the city will take part in a tournament based
on It's a Knockout at the rate of four teams of six children every half
hour. Anyone who wants to know how many children will take part between
the 11am start and the 4pm finish should head for the Past, Present and
Future marquee, which will no doubt offer a variety of ways of counting,
as well as every sort of game from a giant ball for mass keepie-uppie to
computers.
The Transport marquee will have old methods of transport from the
Museum of Transport, but will also offer pony rides as well as fun on
inflatables. In the media tent there is a chance to make movies or
splash out with Waldo the Whale, a giant underwater inflatable, while
the Senses marquee offers a bit of science and technology, smell and
taste tests, and a giant sandpit.
If all that is too much of a reminder that a return to school is
beckoning, there are fun sports sessions, games galore, bungee running
and a surf machine. Stuart Douglas has seen the Playday grow from 3000
to 6000 children between 1993 and 1994 -- and claims he is looking
forward to hosting 10,000 this year.
His advice to parents is: ''Don't be put off if the weather changes.
There will be plenty to do under cover if necessary and children don't
notice the rain.'' What rain? That's the magic waterfall machine and
like everything else on the day, it's free. Just go along and
communicate the joy of play.

<HEADLINE>Greenaways purchase will double Pillans' turnover</HEADLINE>

EDINBURGH-based financial printer Pillans &amp; Wilson has acquired
Greenaway Harrison from the conglomerate Lonrho, in a #2.4m move which
will double its turnover.
Like Pillans, Greenaways specialises in the printing of company annual
reports and corporate finance-related documents, such as those detailing
rights issues, takeovers, and defences. The move will take the annual
turnover of Pillans to #25m, creating the largest independent financial
print specialist in the UK.
One of the reasons Pillans was able to pick up Greenaways for only
#2.4m was that the former Lonrho subsidiary made pre-tax profits of only
#296,000, on turnover of #12.5m, in the 12 months to end-September last
year. After deducting Lonrho's management charge, the figure was just
#157,000.
Lonrho claimed a premium of about #800,000 over Greenaways'
end-September net asset value of #1.6m, which does not take account of
the current year's profits.
Pillans, which made pre-tax profits of #881,000 on sales of #12.3m in
the year to December, believes it can improve Greenaways' profitability.
The latter's London printing and typesetting operations will be merged
with those of Financial Print and Communications (FPC), a corporate
finance printing operation acquired by Pillans four years ago.
Pillans' managing director, Bob Hodgson, said there would be some
rationalisation. However, no jobs should go at its Edinburgh
headquarters, which will gain corporate finance-related business as a
result of the acquisition.
The company, which was founded by James Pillans in Edinburgh in 1775
and sold by the Wilson family to Leicester-based Colorgraphics in 1988,
was the subject of a #1.6m management buy-in two years later.
Mr Hodgson, sales and marketing director Graham Bowstead and former
financial director Ray Cargill were backed by venture capitalists Murray
Johnstone and NatWest Ventures, who also helped fund the latest deal.
Bank of Scotland provided debt for the Greenaways acquisition.
Although the mode of exit for Pillans' venture capitalists is still a
matter of debate, Mr Hodgson said a Stock Exchange listing would
ultimately be one possibility.
Pillans, which also has operations in Glasgow and Manchester, employs
136 people. Greenaways, with another base in Stroud, Gloucestershire,
employs 180.
Pillans produces annual reports for Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank,
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Wimpey, and Grampian Holdings.

DEVELOPMENT of the former Goodyear site at Drumchapel in Glasgow
received a boost yesterday with the announcement that Sainsbury is
planning to build a 70,000sq ft food store and petrol station there. The
significant investment would greatly enhance redevelopment at the
50-acre site, where a variety of projects are already under way.

RISK. Reward. Upside. Downside. The commercial lexicon can sound so
neatly balanced, the Tweedledum-Tweedledee words dinging round the brain
like some threat-free mantra. Harmless, that is, until the interplay of
the forces they represent suddenly claims someone you know and admire.
I don't know anyone who has struck it big in the National Lottery.
There the risks, at #1 a ticket, are relatively small. But the chances
of winning millions are even slimmer. There's slightly more chance of
being struck dead by lightning, a mathematician friend informs me.
I do know Bill Fleming, founder of the Smiley tyre and exhaust chain,
who made his millions when he sold that business to Continental, the
German tyre maker, in 1992. Bill has tasted the sweet rewards of
commercial risk. But Bill is now bankrupt, as is his wife Sandra, thanks
to the collapse of an ill-starred venture into book selling.
I feel for them both. They could have put their feet up, invested the
Smiley proceeds, and enjoyed an enviable standard of living for the rest
of their lives. But Bill Fleming would not have found contentment if
life consisted simply of yacht, sun lounger, and that tricky dog-leg to
the left off the fourteenth.
The Flemings did buy Barncluith, a neglected sixteenth-century house
and gardens in Hamilton. Buying Barncluith was the realisation of a
childhood dream for Bill, who used to eye it enviously as a teenager,
when working as a labourer on the Duke's estates, across the Avon gorge.
But buying Barncluith was also a costly labour of love. The Flemings
were also using some of their new-found wealth to restore an important
slice of Scotland's heritage to its former glory. Their plan was to open
the gardens to the public when the work was complete.
Bill Fleming also used a portion of the Smiley proceeds to fund his
activities as a business angel. Having made money from an early
investment in a relative's software business, Fleming was keen for more
such opportunities. He invested in filling stations, a cycle retailer, a
book publisher, a printer cartridge recycling business, a tree nursery,
and several more.
Not because he was simply greedy for even bigger rewards. But because
Fleming had become almost evangelical about the cause of
entrepreneurship, his belief being that too few Scots take risks in
business and that many more need to be encouraged to take the plunge if
our economy is really to thrive again.
The Flemings last new venture was Tower Bookshops, an attempt to marry
the title range of the mainstream bookstores with the pricing policy of
the bargain basements. It foundered endebted, after just three outlets
were opened, and with it has gone Barncluith and everything else the
sale of Smiley brought them.
Bill Fleming can be criticised for being cocky enough to think he
could drive a commercial coach and horses single-handed through the Net
Book Agreement. He can be censured for being so naive as to found Tower
as a family partnership, not a limited company, and give personal
guarantees on the property leases.
But he cannot be faulted for taking the risks he did with the millions
he could so easily have sat on. Nor should he be condemned for failing
to repeat the success he achieved with Smiley. These bankruptcies are
personal tragedies for the Flemings. They would be even greater
tragedies for Scotland if the sad events of the past few weeks were used
to knock the cause Bill Fleming so vocally advocated.
Happily, apart from dredging up some careless Fleming
hostages-to-fortune about how easy book retailing would prove compared
with selling tyres, the media has reported the Fleming bankruptcies
maturely and fairly. There has been little enthusiasm for knocking the
high-flier back into the midden, little thirst for that dispiriting
kneejerk Scottish response: I kent he widnae last.
After rumours that Bill Fleming was in trouble began to swirl, I
attended last Wednesday's announcement by Scottish Enterprise of a
''world first'', a new #25m partnership fund with the private sector to
invest in small and medium-sized enterprises.
The fund is an attempt to lure more institutions -- banks, insurance
companies, fund managers, and the like -- into taking equity stakes, in
the #50,000 to #500,000 range, in the growth businesses of tomorrow.
Until now, equity finance on that modest scale has been regarded as too
disruptive of management time to be worth the effort. The resulting gap
has been partly filled by Scottish Development Finance, the investment
arm of the old SDA, and, latterly, Scottish Enterprise.
Since 1982 it has invested some #50m and claims to have levered in
#400m more from the private sector. In recent years the Scottish Office
has become uneasy about a publicly-funded agency taking the lead in
something which ought, ministers believe, to be a matter for the market.
Attempts were made to privatise the portfolio. These attempts were
eventually aborted. Now Scottish Enterprise has come up with a new
method of filling the gap, by giving the private sector a relatively
risk-free way to dip its toe back in neglected waters.
The #25m will come, half-and-half, from SE's own resources and from
the private sector players. Thanks to a deal with the European
Investment Fund, the private investors will be able, for a commercial
fee, to guarantee themselves against loss of their original investment.
The guarantee only covers half the #25m. But, to sweeten the private
sector's re-entry to small-end equity investment, Scottish Enterprise is
waiving its right to half the guarantee, ensuring the private sector
subscriptions will be covered in full.
I can see why Scottish Enterprise is doing it. Risk can be, as Bill
Fleming has found, the extremely painful downside of seeking the
rewards, material and immaterial, of building businesses. I wish the
risk, in his case, had not turned out as devastating as it has. I hope
his talents flourish once more, when this pain has eased. But I'm not
convinced the job of a publicly-funded agency is to create virtually
risk-free investment opportunities for private sector institutions.

BRITISH Airways has started its trading year with a very strong
performance which confirms its position as one of the world's top
performing airlines, though the rest of its year promises not to be so
dramatic.
With passenger load factor hitting a first-quarter record of 73.5%,
against 69.3%, profits jumped 57% to #135m for the three months to June.
Actual passenger numbers were up 7% at 8,303,000, with the comparison
helped by last year's mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport, which put
people off.
BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall yesterday declared proudly that the
trend has carried on with load factor climbing by more than 80% in July,
the fifth month in a row it has increased.
This is happening despite increasing capacity, not in terms of
aircraft numbers, which are actually down from 294 to 286, but in
relationship to seats. Revenue passenger kilometres rose 11.8%, more
than double the 5.4% rise in available seat kilometres.
Despite the growth in traffic the airline business remains intensely
competitive and yields are under pressure in real terms, with BA's
scheduled passenger yield falling by 2.5%.
This reflected the growth in long-haul traffic, transfer traffic and
the World Offers low fare programme which helps fill seats which would
otherwise be empty. Long-haul is actually more profitable than
short-haul on the whole, but revenue per passenger per kilometre flown
is lower because fares as well as operating costs are lower.
Demand in the premium priced parts of the cabin continues to increase,
with the trend also apparent on European routes, helped by BA's Club
Europe revamp.
The rapid growth in freight traffic has been checked by an increase in
the weight of passengers. The Civil Aviation Authority has decided that
we are all getting heavier and has raised the notional average weight
per passenger from 75 to 80 kilos (ie from 11 stone 11 lbs to 12 stone 6
lbs).
BA has of course maintained its downward pressure on costs though
employee numbers have crept up from 52,514 to 54,160 and staff costs
were up 8% in part owing to increased provision for profit sharing.
Overall BA's mainstream business is in excellent shape while its
peripheral interests which make up its grand strategy for a global
network seem at last to be picking up. In particular the future of USAir
in which BA has invested #251m is less in doubt.
It surprised commentators by announcing first-half profits of $16m
against losses of $183m and now expects to have achieved $400m of the
current target of $500m cost savings by the end of 1995 and to surpass
the 1996 target.
BA was not best pleased with USAir's original plan for cost savings in
exchange for employee shares in the airline which was anathema to BA and
its hard-headed approach to industrial relations.
With its better financial performance, USAir is getting tough with its
workforce in the usual way. No doubt BA is helping the company with its
cost-saving plans given its experience. Meanwhile Sir Colin says the
alliance between the two is as strong as ever. Through ticketing will be
extended further this autumn.
BA is showing a loss on its investment in the Australian airline
Qantas following the latter's privatisation sale, where the share price
disappointed. But this is of little importance given the long-term
nature of the stake.
More importantly, the Continental European airlines, TAT in France and
Deutsche BA (DBA) are improving. They still make loses but these are
running at lower levels.
TAT has trimmed its international routes, concentrating on those
between France and the UK, which has improved revenue. Load factor is up
to expectations for both companies but price competition is still
intense.
DBA has raised its share of the domestic market while the twice daily
Munich to Gatwick run has brought more people to connecting BA services
than forecast.
The current trading quarter will compare with a strong one last year
and so will not be as dynamic as the opening three months and analysts
were reluctant to change their full year forecasts so early despite the
stronger than expected showing so far. But BA shares, up 9p at
447[1/2]p, are well supported on prospective annual profits of about
#550m, up from #327m.

A LOWER interest charge and improved property investment income
contributed to a strong half-year performance from Transatlantic
Holdings, the group announced yesterday.
Its share of profits from its 50% stake in insurer Sun Life in the six
months to the end of June was a mere #300,000 higher at #22.8m compared
with the corresponding period last year.
Property investment income grew by almost 7% to #48.3m with progress
seen in all its property activities.
But the group's pre-tax profit, which rose to #50.3m from #44.2m, also
benefited from lower interest costs following the flotation of Capital
Shopping Centres.
Shareholders will see their half-year dividend payout rise by 0.6p to
6.6p on earnings per share of 8.49p against 8.26p.

Lest you find yourself cringing before the Boss, Anthony Troon
suggests a counter-technique to take the strain out of that interview
situation
THE interview is tomorrow. You've spent three hours at the
hairdresser's and your darkest, most significant business suit is back
from the dry-cleaners. You've still got to decide on make-up and
earrings, but maybe your wife could advise you on this one.
(Listen: this is not a sexist article. For ''wife'' read ''husband''
or ''partner'', and start again. This is an equal-opportunity article).
You really want the job and you've put a lot into it so far. Your
letter of application, rewritten and refined eight times, is a model of
courtesy and coolly expressed sham confidence: your CV, which you had
laser-printed and bound at no mean expense, is as glossy as the annual
report from a company with obscene profits to spend. You knew they were
impressed, otherwise they wouldn't have called you for the interview.
Which is tomorrow. Now it's you and Them.
But this is where the problem starts, because they will be calling the
shots. There will probably be three of them conducting the interview,
one fewer in number than the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, but that's not
much of a comfort.
They might not interview you from the saddle, but you know that while
they have your CV, you don't have theirs. It's not fair. All the
well-practised techniques of the job interview are loaded in their
favour: for example, you won't have the chance to apply psychometric
testing to them, or ask them for a sample of their handwriting, their
blood, or even a stool. How do you know that they're good enough to
become your employers?
(OK, they have the money and they need somebody like you. It's a
trade-off. But how can you convince them that you are the somebody like
you that they need?)
On your way to the interview, there's only one powerful piece of
advice that runs through your mind. It's something you were told one
night in the pub. ''When you're being interviewed for a job,'' said your
four-lager consultant, ''try to visualise your interviewers sitting on
the toilet. This reminds you that they are as vulnerable as you are. You
know that they have to sit on the toilet, at least once a day, otherwise
they would explode rather messily.
''But they want this fact to be kept a dark secret. The idea that they
have to sit on the toilet like any ordinary mortal -- especially the
ordinary mortal they are interviewing for the job -- is deeply shaming
to them, a weak spot, a sort of Achilles' bum.
''So imagine your three interviewers sitting in a row on a bank of
toilets. At a stroke, they are stripped of their massive psychological
advantage.
''This,'' continued your informant after a fifth lager, which you
bought in gratitude, ''is the killer touch, the psychological coup
d'etat which could get you through the interview and secure you the job.
But there's just one problem. Try not to snigger at them too much.''
Thanks, you said. This was your introduction to bumology, a valuable
counter-technique that could be useful if you reached the short leet.
And when it came to the final interview it probably was. Recent reports
have shown that in their selection techniques, employers are as much in
the dark as their job applicants.
Psychometric testing can be nearly as accurate in character and
personality assessment as graphology or even astrology, which isn't very
much. In the end, it comes down to the effect you make on the blighters,
sitting there in judgment upon you, and whether you can play them at
their own game.
So the new hairdo was a good move, and the dry-cleaning was pretty
smart. The earrings, or single earring, were (or was) well chosen. The
polished shoes were expected of you, and you could hardly be criticised
for arriving five minutes early. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,
minus one, are sitting in the next room and waiting to tell you whether
you're a hit or a miss.
Despite all of their clever techniques, they are as liable to fluff
the coming interview as you are. The most powerful piece of psychology
is actually in your hands. At this moment, they are as wise about the
outcome as you.
This is the moment to take a deep breath and think bumology. If
psychometry is as reliable as graphology, then bumology is as reliable
as psychometry. The outcome is in your hands. Your name is called and
you walk confidently into the interview room. This is also the moment
when you have to wipe the smile off your face and start to look serious
-- unless the job is for a stand-up comic at some awful club. This is
when your qualities as a potential employee are really being tested.
Three people sit before you, on the toilet. ''Hello,'' says the one in
the middle. ''Thank you for attending the interview. Please take a
seat.'' You lift the lid and sit down. Damn. They've heard the story
too.

SCOTTISHPOWER, whose #1000m offer for Chester-based electricity
distributor Manweb is costing #32m in expenses, yesterday started the
60-day bid clock ticking with the issue of its formal offer document to
shareholders.
The listing particulars, relating to the new shares to be allotted
under the cash-plus-shares terms of its hostile bid, reveal the
Glasgow-based utility will have to meet these expenses if and when the
offer is successful.
But Manweb chief executive John Roberts yesterday promised a ''robust
defence to see off these Scottish raiders'', adding that ScottishPower's
offer seriously undervalued the company.
In his letter to Manweb shareholders, ScottishPower chairman Murray
Stuart reiterates that Manweb is the third-highest-cost distributor in
the UK and ScottishPower is the lowest.
He says: ''ScottishPower is confident it can improve Manweb's business
for the benefit of both shareholders and customers.''
With ScottishPower shares having advanced to 324p since the offer was
announced two weeks ago, its cash-plus-shares terms have risen in value
from 945p to 963p. There is a cash alternative of 915p.
The first deadline for acceptances by Manweb shareholders is August
29. Manweb has 14 days from yesterday to issue its defence.
Meanwhile, ScottishPower shareholders will be asked to approve the
proposed takeover of Manweb, and authorise the directors to amend or
renew the offer or take any other necessary action, at an extraordinary
meeting on September 4.
With the question of intervention by regulator Offer, or a reference
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, still hanging over the deal,
Manweb shares yesterday added 2p to 889p, closing well below the value
of the ScottishPower offer.

STIRLING Shipping Company of Glasgow is to become the largest operator
of platform supply vessels in the UK sector of the North Sea after
announcing plans for a fleet merger with Star Offshore Services of
Aberdeen.
The merger -- the outcome of a provisional agreement under which
Stirling Shipping will buy Star Offshore's entire fleet of six platform
supply vessels and two anchor handling supply tugs -- will consolidate
the role of British operators in a market traditionally dominated by
Scandinavian competition.
The acquisition of the Star Offshore fleet is the latest in a series
of market development initiatives undertaken by Stirling.
Earlier this year, it placed contracts with Clydeside shipyards
Kvaerner Govan and Ferguson Shipbuilders for two large platform vessels,
worth about #12.5m each. Both are due for delivery next summer.
Stirling also enhanced its fleet to meet customer requirements by
replacing two small, older vessels with a much larger one last year.
The resulting joint fleet promises to employ a total of more than 200
British seamen and to provide job continuity for all crew members of
both companies.
Iain Harrison, chairman of Stirling Shipping and its owner,
Glasgow-based shipowner and shipmanager Harrisons (Clyde), said: ''Our
future and the future of the British marine industry serving this
important offshore sector depends more and more upon quality of service.
''We must, therefore, continually strive to find ways of offering our
customers a better and more competitive service. I believe one of the
best ways of doing this is by combining the resources, skills and
abilities of British firms.''
Stirling Shipping's managing director, James Cowderoy, added:
''Stirling and Star are a natural fit. We have similar fleets, similar
customers and similar philosophies. It's a 'win-win' for all involved.
The merged fleet provides a broader and deeper scope of service for our
customers, more opportunities for seagoing staff, and a base for further
growth for the company.''
The new combined fleet will include several large, modern PSVs suited
to combined logistics operations and operations west of Shetland.

JOE DONNELLY meets the Scot who
discovered computing's holy grail
BILL ELDER'S first few career moves in industry seem, at first glance,
to have been disastrous. Or at least ill-starred.
Born in Glasgow, he left the garage in Charing Cross where he worked
as a mechanic to join Rootes (later Chrysler, later Talbot) in Linwood
as a work study engineer. Today there is hardly a trace of the once
massive car plant in Renfrewshire.
From there he went to Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, only a couple of years
before the historic sit-in, just as major shipbuilding on the Clyde was
winding down.
With #1000 in his pocket and big ideas in his head, he bought a
one-way ticket and emigrated to California to make a career in San
Francisco's vast shipbuilding industry. He arrived just as the Hunters
Point shipyard gates shut for the last time, signalling the death of the
business in the state.
It was bad luck, rather than miscalculation on Bill Elder's part. Any
decisions thereafter seem to have been propitious, but it was an early
one, to go to night school to get a degree in industrial engineering at
Paisley Technical College, that really set the ambitious Scot on the
road to success.
Thirty years on, that after-work study and his native Scots
determination have taken him to the top in his own semiconductor
company. Since the sixties, he has made few miscalculations.
In the first six months of this year, Genus, the company he founded
back in 1981, sold $47m in semiconductor products to achieve record
profits. Genus Inc. develops, manufactures, markets, and services
advanced thin film deposition, a system so important that, basically, if
a company are manufacturing silicon chips, they are probably using Bill
Elder's system.
''In late '68, when I arrived in San Francisco, hardly anybody knew
what semiconductors were,'' he says. ''It looked to me as if it had
tremendous potential.''
His fascination with electronics led him to Fairchild Semiconductor in
Hong Kong, and then to Kasper Instruments in 1979, where he turned a
substantial loss-maker around to make a $4m profit. But by this time he
was determined to go out on his own. He took with him Kasper's best
brains and between them they perfected the vapour deposition system --
virtually the holy grail of the computer industry.
''Our technique allowed IBM to move to 64k then 256k machines, and
allowed them to produce the dynamic random chip,'' says Elder. ''That
was the technology which improved computer access time and I am proud to
think it was Genus Inc. which helped the industry make such huge
advances.
''This year we will do over $100m, which is not bad for a company
which went public in 1988.''
Bill Elder remembers his early days with some pride. ''Paisley was
where the seeds of my ambition were sown,'' he admits. Scots drive and
ambition seem to be at a premium in the States. ''There is probably not
a company in Silicon Valley that doesn't have a Scot at executive level,
which is pretty good for a small country.''
Now he is trading all over the world, but returns to Scotland when he
can. A recent visit was marked with an honour from his old technical
college, now the University of Paisley, where he received an honorary
doctorate, a distinction which fills him with considerable pride.
''I couldn't believe it when Paisley invited me to accept the
doctorate. It was an emotional day for me, and something I consider the
highlight of my career,'' he adds.
As a result of his association with the college and university, Bill
says his new ambition is to put something back into the business which
has brought him substantial rewards.
At the degree ceremony he told graduates: ''When I left Paisley
Technical College in 1968 with my diploma from the Institute of Work
Study Practitioners, little did I realise that I would return years
later as the recipient of an honorary doctor's degree.
''I had no idea then that I would found a high-technology company and
compete as its chairman in a global economy. Scots with their
adventurous nature can compete in this new world.
''There are other young men involved in getting their companies up and
running. I'm looking at venture capital, with a view to giving some of
these young people the assistance they need.
''To this end, I have also decided to fund a foundation at the
University of Paisley for entrepreneurs. Through that I will get more
involved with the up-and-coming, determined businessmen from Scotland
who will forge the shape of the next century.''
With #1000 in his pocket and big ideas in his head, he bought a
one-way ticket to California

FUND manager Invesco is riding the American bull market, with a 20%
rise in profits to #22.5m before exceptionals in the first six months of
the year.
Yet its shares fell 20p to 238p following a decision by its largest
shareholder, Peregrine Investments of Hong Kong, to sell its stake,
having about trebled its money.
About 82% of Invesco's #46.5bn funds under management are in the US
and with Wall Street up 20% in the period it is hardly surprising that
profits have steamed ahead. The group has #6600m in Europe and 58% of
its funds are in equities.
There had been hopes that Peregrine would bid for the group rather
than sell out but the move will greatly increase the number of shares in
circulation in the US which should benefit them long-term.
Total funds under management rose 12% in the period and margins
widened from 22% to 24% on the back of strict cost control. The
exceptional credit of #3.3m mainly represented an insurance payout. The
interim dividend is raised 40% to 1.75p.

BENSON Crisps is delighted by the initial response to the launch of
the Beano and Dandy character snack foods such as Desperate Dan's Cow
Pie. Gone is the Hedgehog flavour enjoyed by the organic food types of
four or five years ago in a business where innovation is at a premium
even if the traditional salt and vinegar crisp is still the best overall
seller.
However, Benson needs all the help it can get after losses last year
of #6.72m as a result of extreme pressure on margins and a major
reorganisation programme. In the latest six months, the deficit has been
cut from #1.69m to #955,000 on turnover little changed at #14.1m.
There appears to have been a substantial change in thinking by
supermarkets which are trying harder to attract customers through
quality and service rather than pricing. So Benson has been able to
increase prices twice even though the advantage has been largely
whittled away through increased production costs for packaging and
ingredients.
Happily, the new season crop of Record and Rosetta potatoes appears to
be above average in starch quality and so production costs on that vital
ingredient should abate.
The closure of the factory in Newport, South Wales, which reduced the
overall workforce by 180 to about 400 employees has taken over #2m of
annual costs out of the business with the Kirkham, Lancashire, factory
making up the production volumes.
A #4.6m financing earlier this year at 16p a share reduced gearing to
75%. This was accompanied by a management shake-up.
Given the uncertainty elsewhere in the snacks and crisps industry with
major competitors in some turmoil, Benson should be able to gain market
share without losing margin.
At 18p, there are reasonable recovery prospects with the current half
year likely to show breakeven and with next year back into overall
profit.

PROFITS at Filtronic Comtek trebled last year to #3.3m on turnover up
152% to #25.7m. The company, which designs and manufactures complex
technical devices used by mobile telecommunications systems, has
benefited from the strong growth in demand worldwide for mobile phones.
Its customers include the world's leading manufacturers of cellular
radio network equipment and the principal network operators such as
AT&amp;T, Motorola, Nokia, Cellnet and Vodafone. It designs and manufactures
filters and sub-systems from facilities in the US and UK, including a
site at Stewarton, Ayrshire.
The Scottish facility has been enhanced to create an additional 10,000
sq ft of manufacturing capability.
Earnings per share rose to 6.36p from 2.98p and there is a dividend
per share of 0.75p. Yesterday, Filtronic shares were 7p cheaper at 324p,
which compares very favourably with the placing price of 105p last
October.

WHITBREAD has bought 16 Marriott branded hotels for #180m to boost its
representation at the quality end of the UK hospitality market. These
include the 298-room Marriott Hotel in Glasgow and the 154-room unit in
Aberdeen.
The deal had been expected for the last week, although more attention
had been focused upon the possibility of the brewer and retailer
acquiring the David Lloyd Leisure group after Mr Lloyd said he was
involved in takeover talks.
A Whitbread spokesman predictably refused to comment on that possible
purchase which could cost #180m. David Lloyd shares were up 23p to a new
peak of 364p yesterday for a market worth of #172m.
The Marriott hotels are being sold by Scott's Hospitality of Canada,
which is also giving Whitbread the brand developing and operating rights
for Great Britain.
One major advantage of the purchase is that Whitbread will have access
to the international Marriott reservation system which is highly
important in attracting American and Japanese tourists, who may be chary
of booking accommodation trading under an unknown brand name.
It will increase the Whitbread room stock by 3100, bringing the total
to 9800. According to industry specialist Pannell Kerr Foster, this puts
it in third place behind Forte with 31,160 rooms and Mount Charlotte
Thistle with 13,207, and just ahead of Queens Moat Houses which had 9719
at last reckoning.
The price being paid per room is #55,000 and one seasoned industry
observer said that at first sight Whitbread appeared to have done well.
The company's 79 Travel Inns will continue to be branded separately.
These compete head-on with Forte's Travelodges and are being opened at a
rate of one every 10 days.
There were already 12 Country Club hotels and 18 three-star units in
the group before the Marriott deal. However, the company has not been a
particularly enthusiastic player in the sector until very recently. It
has concentrated instead on its branded restaurants, Brewers Fayres and
theme pubs.
The deal can be seen as marking time -- as would the possible David
Lloyd acquisition -- until chairman Sir Michael Angus and chief
executive Peter Jarvis decide to grasp the nettle and bid for
Allied-Domecq's brewing subsidiary Carlsberg-Tetley.
They have already failed to buy Chef and Brewer and Courage, both
purchased by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, assuming the remaining formalities
for the latter are nodded through. Whitbread may need to demonstrate
greater dynamism through a significant strategic acquisition.
The continuing recovery in the UK hotel market, underlined by both
improving occupancy and achieved room rates for the larger chains,
partly at the expense of the independent operators, is expected to boost
Marriott's UK profits from #7.8m on turnover of #72m to more than #14m
in the current year. This should be beneficial to Whitbread's earnings.
The shares eased 3p to 622p.

THE damaging impact of the Latin American financial crisis on emerging
markets worldwide, coupled with a poor showing by smaller companies
generally, culminated in a disappointing full-year result for Mid Wynd
International Investment Trust.
Net asset value fell 2.3% to 401.2p in the year to end-June, while the
investment trust's benchmark FT World index advanced 3.7%.
Mid Wynd increased its dividend by 4.8% to 6.5p, with a final payout
of 3.9p.
During the year, only about 13% of the smaller companies-focused fund
was invested in North American equities. This extraordinarily low
percentage for a trust of its type reflected Mid Wynd's bearish stance
on Wall Street.
It was, therefore, poorly-positioned to take full advantage of the
recent surge in the New York stock market where hi-tech stocks have
roared ahead.
The Mexican financial crisis, which began late last year, damaged
emerging markets throughout Latin America, in South-east Asia and also
in Europe until the end of March.
Looking ahead, Mid Wynd considers it reasonable, on valuation grounds,
to expect smaller companies to catch up with their larger counterparts
during the current financial year.
There has been some recovery in emerging markets, which should
ultimately feed through to the smaller companies.
The trust believes a general slowdown in activity in the world's main
economies has improved the prospects for interest rate cuts and expects
stock markets to provide reasonable returns during its current financial
year.
At June 30, Mid Wynd had 29.2% of funds in UK equities, with 21.3% in
Continental Europe, 19.1% in the Asia Pacific region, 13.8% in North
America, 8.1% in Latin American stock markets, and 3.4% in Japanese
shares.
It had 3.6% in foreign bonds and expects to continue running down
these holdings.
Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications stock, was the major casualty
in Latin America.

AYR-based James Dickie Forging has been sold out of receivership to a
West Midlands company.
Its acquisition by HKB Steels, a steel company not previously involved
in the forgings business, saves 50 shop-floor and 14 administrative and
technical jobs.
Before it went into receivership in June, James Dickie Forging
employed about 90 people.
The firm, the subject of a #600,000 management buy-out from James
Dickie about three years ago, will continue in business at its site near
Ayr United's Somerset Park. James Dickie itself continues to trade as a
publicly-quoted company.
James Dickie Forging was, to an extent, a victim of its own success.
In the year to end-August, turnover jumped about 50% to #3m.
In order to satisfy increased demand for its products, which include
vehicle and drill parts, James Dickie Forging had to invest heavily in
producing dies for customers. As a result, it ran out of working capital
to finance growing turnover.

''We will try to win the next election in Scotland; make no mistake
about that . . . I think we've got scope and room for improvement, both
in terms of how we present our overall message of trying to win the
election, and also in terms of how we target more effectively to make
sure we win more seats.''
A NOTE of realism hangs about the SNP these days, to judge by Alex
Salmond's remarks to Ken Smith in yesterday's lengthy Herald interview.
Bluntly, the SNP leader dismissed his party's 1992 campaign as
''incompetent'', admitted weak organisation in the near-miss Monklands
East by-election, made no bones about the SNP's lack of cash, and
regretted the party's failure to capitalise, in 1992, on its potential
in such Lowland areas as Dumbarton and Clackmannan.
This is not the Alex Salmond of 1990, whose very election to the
leadership left him perilously weak; so many SNP hotshots had opposed
his candidacy, and so many were thereby humiliated in his convincing
victory, that he spent the next couple of years mending fences. Nor is
it the Alex Salmond of 1992, in thrall to the mighty Jim Sillars, whose
blistering rhetoric frightened Scots voters off in droves. Salmond has
always been a man of wit; he is, in 1995, now emerging as a politician
of considerable judgment.
Organisation at North Charlotte Street, Edinburgh, has been mightily
renewed. In Mike Russell the party has a capable chief executive. The
local elections of April, and the by-election campaign of May, showed a
dangerous edge of competence. At SNP events and conferences one cannot
but marvel at the hosts of articulate, enthusiastic members. Labour
events have a geriatric quality these days.
Salmond, of course, is not obliged to explain the former failures and
reverses, though he does well to admit them. It was as much the hype of
Sillars and Neil, as lack of money, that made the party falter so badly
in 1992. It is nice of Salmond not to blame candidate Kay Ullrich for
the loss of Monklands East -- too many of his colleagues do -- but the
failure to take John Smith's old stamping ground was down to bad tactics
rather than thin bank balances.
The decision was taken to target local corruption in Monklands
Labour-locked council. Liddell, at length, repudiated the council
herself, sidestepping the mess neatly as the SNP blundered into a
sectarian quagmire. It was entirely the wrong campaign for the seat, and
it failed.
If Salmond is to be interpreted rightly, the SNP in 1996 or 1997 will
pursue a much more focused and pragmatic campaign. It will concentrate
on perhaps six classic target seats. In addition the Nationalists will
press hard on such promising Labour spots as Ochil and Linlithgow. For
the rest of Scotland, the Nationalists will try nothing more than
maximising their overall vote. Assuming the SNP won all its Tory and
Lib-Dem prospects, and pulled a couple of seats off Labour, and held its
existing base, then the next SNP group in Parliament would be
nine-strong, a convincing little bloc to make hay with Labour home rule
policies.
But there are certain wider realities which Salmond and the SNP should
face.
First, it now seems certain that Labour will dominate the General
Election campaign and that Labour will win it. This will make the SNP's
task extremely difficult. It is most unlikely that the Nationalists can
win more than six to nine seats in that scenario and their campaign
rhetoric must give no hostages to fortune. The SNP cannot even take
Perth &amp; Kinross for granted. It has never successfully defended a
by-election gain and the May votes did not suggest that Ms Cunningham
has a seat for life.
The strategic eye should be on the election after next, when Labour
will have much to defend and by which time Blair and friends should be
in all kinds of wonderful devolution tangles.
Secondly, the SNP must soon develop a credible stand on devolution
plans put to the House of Commons by the putative Labour government. The
SNP has much to gain from a Scottish Parliament, however circumscribed
it may be: a national Scottish forum of any sort, which Labour in future
could not abolish and which a future Tory government would happily
retain for the price of cutting Scottish (and Labour) seats at
Westminster, should be the perfect vehicle for independence.
Thirdly, the SNP, accordingly, should retreat emotionally from its
cherished with-one-leap-we-shall-be-free election strategy. It would be
wonderful if, with one bound, Scots voters returned 40 SNP MPs at a
General Election and promptly sued for independence. Such wonders are
confined to Ossianic legend. The SNP is unlikely ever to elect a
substantial group to Westminster; the task of a smaller group is, by
very fear and dread of their presence, to force the Westminster parties
to deliver a Scottish legislature.
And, fourthly, Salmond and colleagues should ponder the merits of
drawing their party back to the centre. The SNP is at present the most
left-wing parliamentary party in Europe. Since 1980 the Nationalists
have pursued a strategy of transplanting Labour in Scotland by laying
claim to a radical socialist inheritance. It is true that any SNP
breakthrough must come by winning many Labour seats. But Labour's hold
on the Scottish electorate is atavistic, not logical. The grim truth is
that the strategy has failed. The SNP's presence in Scotland was
stronger 20 years ago, in the heyday of Douglas Henderson and Robert
MacIntyre, than it is today.
The leftward strategy has gained little and, in the process, the SNP
has lost much of its old heartlands in northern Scotland to the Liberal
Democrats.
Alex Salmond should consider his own paradoxical position; a socialist
MP for the douce citizens of Banff and Buchan. It is the classless,
non-ideological image of the SNP which, in time, wins seats, not the
cutting edge of policies. The SNP aim should, through time, not be to
replace the Labour Party but to destroy it. Scottish Labour is a big
target, not in its airy theories of devolution, but in its grim
monolithic blight over Lowland Scotland. Council house patronage, jobs
for the boys, and red-nose princelings of Glasgow, the neanderthals of
Monklands and Dumbarton -- these are fit targets for true radical
politicians.
And yet . . .
When I was a young man I thought Salmond knew nothing. It's amazing
how much the young pup has learned.

EVERY metropolis has its hidden slaves. Its unrecorded workforce of
migrants who never exist on any accountant's books but for long hours
and futile pay labour for the profit of unscrupulous employers. Often,
of course, the exploited themselves give such abuse their blessing. They
have reached the city from somewhere else in quest of something -- a
dream, big money, possibly fame -- and, as worshipful beginners, they
are willing to sell their energies for next to nothing.
Recently the Migrants Support Unit reported that fruit and vegetable
farmers in the rich areas of East Anglia and Kent were employing
refugees and illegal aliens, many of them Bosnians and Ethiopians, to
pick crops for far less than the legal minimum of #2.79 per hour.
Isolated in caravans, away from the main farm site, the workers were
controlled by gang leaders who bullied them into double shifts which
meant toiling in the fields day and night. This summer you can be sure
there are others in our inner cities -- poor blacks, Asians, Orientals,
guileless school leavers, and rejected graduates -- who, finding
orthodox employment closed to them, escape the breadline to accept, in
desperation, the kind of sweatshop challenge no amount of effort can
satisfy.
All over the developed world, in fact, these people are among the
recession's victims, uninsured, unrepresented, untrained, and therefore
hired and fired on the briefest notice; the non-persons of flagrant
market forces, whose treatment has been described by the Home Office as
''not a major issue''. So, little hairdresser apprentices work through
the day without a lunch break. Hotel trainees are retained ''on
probation'' so that bosses may avoid paying anything remotely like the
minimum wage. And men as well as women are now employed as part-timers
which permits them scant benefits and no long-term security. And just at
a time when we are urged to recognise our new identity as a service
economy such shabby treatment breeds a self-defeating sullenness.
This summer, in one of the grander hotels in St Andrews, three
visitors from America paced the lounge while waiting three quarters of
an hour for sandwiches. These had previously been ordered for 11am so
that the party could be prompt in teeing off. Three times they reminded
the harassed girl on duty of their urgency. Three times she reminded an
indifferent and presumably understaffed kitchen. Finally the group left,
still without so much as a sugar cube between them. They were courteous
in voicing their complaint, but clearly puzzled by the revelation that
this was how a posh establishment treated guests who were each paying
upwards of #150 per night.
Not long ago, from America itself, came another tale of contemporary
slavery. Child labour, reviled by Charles Dickens for causing such
misery and distress, has returned to New York's garment district around
Seventh Avenue in numbers unseen since the turn of the century.
According to work analysts the situation is so out of control it is
beyond the reach of regulation. In the past the state's Labour
Department have claimed that between 5000 and 10,000 children were
illegally employed in the rag trade every day, almost all the youngsters
documented or undocumented aliens from Mexico, Latin America, or Asia.
Most work for manufacturers who defend the gruelling shifts and derisory
wages as the result of treacherous competition from Far Eastern rivals
where labour costs are even more exploitive. This, of course, is the
predator mocking the poor, pleading impoverishment just like the rest.
A few years ago the Labour Department, suspecting certain clothing
traders of under-age employment, found Mexican children, all unofficial
residents, who had been made to work for 11 hours at a stretch in a room
filled with electrical and fire hazards, solvent fumes, and poor
ventilation. But while some of the children appeared strained by the
long, monotonous hours, others demonstrated the immigrant's traditional
drive, appearing content and conscientious. For them the most squalid
conditions were preferable to no work, or being out on the street,
peddling crack.
For most of us discussion of modern slavery is too shocking to
contemplate. It shouldn't necessarily be confused with the child on
roller-blades, delivering newspapers at 7am, but when people fall into
the poverty trap as now, child labour, however insignificant in
percentage terms, becomes damnably difficult to control. Yet if children
are willing to work, does it matter? Yes, because exploitation of
whatever age, and even within a family, can lead to oppression and
intimidation. To be cheap labour for industries where superhuman
production rates are set by the unprincipled, leaves human beings under
the protection of no-one. What freedom or dignity lie in that?

BRITAIN's longer leading indicator, which signals turning points in
economic activity 13 months ahead, again fell last month.
The 0.3% drop followed a decline, also of 0.3%, in June, and the index
has been in retreat since June of last year.
By contrast the shorter leading indicator, which signals turning
points five months ahead, rose by 0.2% in July, following three months
in which it dropped.
The latest increase was largely attributable to rises in the EC/Gallup
consumer confidence index and in share prices. These offset a fall in
total new orders reported in the CBI's industrial trends survey.
The Central Statistical Office, which publishes the indices, is
considering whether they should be scrapped or replaced.
One idea under investigation is publication of a monthly figure for
gross domestic product. This would cover the two-thirds of economic
activity accounted for by the services sector.

TOM SCOTT, the veteran Scots poet, scholar and polemicist, died early
on Monday at the age of 77. He had been diagnosed with cancer as far
back as 1985. With his customary resilience he not only won 10 more
years, but made his condition the subject of a long poem, Views from
Mycloma; the medical term, he said in an interview, suggested the title
of a symphonic poem by Sibelius.
The allusion was apt for a writer who insisted that music remained the
sister art of poetry, even in times when he felt that poetry was
betrayed by soi-disant poets. As a young man he had seriously
contemplated a career as a singer; arguably, he sublimated this yearning
in such lyrics as The Bride (''I dreamed a luesome dream o ye
yestreen./Ye stuid in dawan fields agin a purpour lift/And a tree a
floueran starns raise frae your croun.'')
Like his contemporary and confrere, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Tom Scott
deployed the idiom of the medieval makars in the context of
twentieth-century realities. As a makar, he upheld the craftmanship
(''the built utterance'') learned from such mentors as William Dunbar,
on whom he published a book-length study in 1966.
As a bard, he was driven by uncompromising social conscience and made
no apology for his use of rhetoric, which he claimed as indispensable to
true poetry. He has been dismissed as irrelevant to the 1990s; there are
signs, though, that his ideas are making a comeback, precisely because
of the 1990s and the current condition of poetry, and of the world.
Tom Scott was born to a working-class family in Partick on June 6,
1918. In 1931 his father, a boilermaker, was made redundant. The family
moved to St Andrews, where Scott senior switched trades to become a
builder.
Young Tom developed an intellectual life independent of the official
university (''Oxbridge-on-Kinness''), but he was befriended by Professor
D'Arcy Thompson, who encouraged the boy's love of science -- later to
bear fruit with the long poem on evolution, The Tree (1977). Also in St
Andrews, he met Edwin Muir, who was to exert a deep spiritual influence.
The St Andrews years are evoked in the autobiographical sequence Brand
the Builder (1975); two years ago the poem returned to the city of its
setting, in a performed reading at the Byre Theatre. 1993 was in fact an
annus mirabilis for the poet, then celebrating his 75th birthday: at
last his Collected Shorter Poems appeared, published jointly by Agenda
Editions and Chapman Publications.
Like many a wandering Scot, he was drawn to the Ulysses myth, and it
was in Mediterranean Europe that he suddenly found himself composing in
the Scots language. T S Eliot encouraged him to translate Villon into
Scots: the results constituted his first book (1953). He attended
Edinburgh University as a mature student, gaining a PhD.
The Ship and Ither Poems appeared from Oxford University Press in
1963: the same decade saw his emergence as a major anthologist, of both
the Penguin and (with John MacQueen) the Oxford books of Scottish verse.
In recent years he has attracted the attention of continental critics,
and it may be that he will be regarded as a European, as well as a
Scottish, poet -- a spiritual voyager in the tradition of his beloved
Dante and Baudelaire.

Accommodating body clocks can take time, Eric Kennedy finds out
DAVID Barbour has a hotel to run so he keeps a close eye on the
weather from the carpeted comfort of his office at Glasgow Airport.
His information screens keep him up to date with climatic conditions
and flight patterns. Bad weather might mean delays on transatlantic
flights, which in turn could result in up to 250 frustrated long-haul
travellers descending suddenly on his hotel for a meal.
''You make sure the food stocks and staffing levels are adequate,'' he
says. ''It's all part of the job.''
Hotel management is a rewarding career and Barbour is not talking
merely about money. ''You get satisfaction from providing the right
product,'' he says.
''Of course guests can sometimes be difficult. We take the view,
however, that if we have been the cause of the frustration, it's up to
us to sort it out.
''As for staff, we feel that no-one comes to work with the intention
of doing a bad job. Too often a management can put obstacles in the way
of workers. We try not to do that at the Forte Crest.''
He has 69 full-time and about 150 part-time or contract staff to deal
with and a hotel with a #5m turnover. People can work their way up in
the hotel business, starting perhaps as a junior receptionist and going
on to become front-office manager.
Those who wish to enter with qualifications can take either of two
routes. The first is to gain an OND (Ordinary National Diploma) or an
HND in hotel management by attending a course at Glasgow Caledonian
University or a college of technology.
The other route is to study for an MBA in hotel management, which is
available now at quite a number of universities. Obviously, the higher
the qualification the better.
Barbour himself entered the business 25 years ago after attending
Hyndland Secondary in Glasgow and King George VI School in Southampton
when the family moved south. He went on to Highbury Technical College in
Portsmouth, and emerged with a National Diploma in Hotelkeeping and
Catering.
He then worked in a number of hotels throughout Britain, going on to
become general manager of the Forte Crest in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was
there for 11 years before coming north in February last year to manage
the much bigger hotel at Glasgow Airport.
His day starts at between 7 and 8am and continues for about 12 hours
before he returns to his wife and two grown-up daughters at nearby
Kilmacolm. He is in the process of implementing a five-year plan for the
hotel, starting in October, part of which will be the redevelopment of
the ground floor.
The hotel is a round-the-clock operation, with guests whose body
clocks sometimes tell them they want breakfast at 5pm. David Barbour's
staff oblige.
Real clocks in the reception area keep track of the various time zones
around the world.
Time is important to David Barbour. So is the weather.

EDINBURGH District Council's environmental services committee
yesterday agreed to set up a special ''Gum Busters'' hit squad to remove
chewing gum from the capital's streets, and flyposters from walls,

Two workers and a special vehicle equipped with power-washing
equipment will cost around #51,000 a year. There has been increasing
concern about the amount of gum stuck to the city's pavements.

A MAN abducted his five-year-old daughter and took her to the US,
sparking a three-year hunt, after his wife began an affair with a
teenager, a court was told yesterday.
Emma Hallam, now eight, was taken to Florida by her father, Martin
Hallam, 35, and his parents after her mother, Michelle Hallam, left home
to be with Russell Oliver, then 19.
Leeds magistrates heard that Emma was abducted by Mr Hallam in May
1992 after her mother was told she was being taken on a five-day camping
trip. Mr Hallam, his parents , and Emma travelled around America until
they were found last week.
Mr Mark Burns, defending Mr Hallam and his mother, Mrs Bertina Don,
63, who are both charged with abduction on May 27, 1992, successfully
applied for reporting restrictions to be lifted yesterday so that his
clients could put their side of the story.
Mr Burns said that before Christmas 1991 Martin Hallam believed he had
a perfect life with his wife and child.
''He was very close to his daughter, more so than most fathers because
he worked nights and spent days at home with her. Because Michelle
Hallam worked, a lot of day-to-day care was done by Mrs Don and Emma
became extremely close to her.''
But Mr Hallam's world collapsed when he discovered his wife was having
an affair with Mr Oliver, Mr Burns said.
Mr Hallam asked his wife to leave their house and he initially looked
after Emma. But Michelle Hallam, a Ministry of Agriculture scientist,
later walked into Emma's school during a lesson and took her home with
her.
Mr Burns said Mr Hallam became concerned when he overheard Mr Oliver
and his wife talking about Emma's behavioural difficulties. He allegedly
heard Mr Oliver say ''he would rule her with a rod of iron''.
Emma would beg her father and Mrs Don not to take her back to her
mother and Mr Oliver after day-trips, the court heard. ''She just
couldn't develop a relationship with Russell Oliver. She became
extremely distressed as a result of that,'' said Mr Burns.
He denied Emma had lived like a fugitive during her three years in
America, saying she had enjoyed dancing classes, home schooling, and had
met friends at a church.
The magistrates granted Mrs Don, of East Dean Drive, Leeds,
unconditional bail until September 18. Mr Hallam was granted conditional
bail with a surety of #3000.

Ros Davidson examines the fatal attraction of San Francisco's famous
bridge
THE Golden Gate Bridge may be one of California's best-known tourist
sights, but the San Francisco span also holds a disturbing and fatal
attraction.
It has become America's most notorious spot for suicides. Indeed,
following two recent and highly publicised deaths, local officials are
considering a special full-time patrol to watch for jumpers.
Just days ago, political consultant Duane Garrett said goodbye to his
11-year-old daughter at their posh Tiburon home, drove to the north end
of the suspension bridge and leapt to his death in the cold Pacific.
Among those responding with shock were Vice-President Al Gore and US
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, for whom he had managed presidential
campaigns.
His death came shortly after the bridge's 1000th confirmed suicide, in
early July. The real number of deaths may be far higher -- often bodies
are simply not found in the shark-infested waters 220ft below.
Ever since the red-coloured Art Deco-style bridge opened in 1937,
linking San Francisco to Marin County, it has been deadly. Within the
first day, an expensive seal-skin coat was found folded neatly on the
pedestrian walkway, a mute tale of the strange attraction.
But the bridge has not always been number one in infamy; over the
years, access to other suicide locations has been closed off. Nowadays
the caldera in Japan's Mount Mihara is surrounded by barbed wire and
guarded by officers with machine-guns,and rails have been erected at the
Eiffel Tower in Paris and Manhattan's Empire State Building. Yet the
Golden Gate Bridge remains relatively easy -- it has no barriers, but it
is still dramatic.
''There are some people for whom the pain in their lives has been
associated with some kind of lack of recognition,'' says Eve Meyer at
San Francisco's suicide-prevention centre. ''The knowledge that they
will have a high-profile death is a meaningful thing.''
It is symbolic, too, of human endeavour on the far-west frontier.
About four-fifths leave their vehicles in car parks at either end of the
bridge but choose to jump facing inland, one of the most populated areas
of California. Only a small minority face the empty Pacific.
After 27 years patrolling the bridge, Ron Garcia says he can often
spot potential suicides -- they walk too purposefully, or wear thin
clothing despite the wind or fog. ''A lot of people we pick up are
people you spot and say, 'This one isn't right.' It's like a sixth
sense,'' he says. Still, guards keep a suicide log as so many still
succeed.
If the special squad is approved for a 12-month trial, four trained
officers on motor scooters will watch from dawn to dusk at an annual
cost of $113,000. In one study, 77% were found to jump during daylight,
presumably because pedestrian access is closed at night anyway.
Perhaps the allure of California for the unusual is just too enduring.
More than 100 years ago, Oscar Wilde wrote, ''It is an odd thing, but
everyone who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.''

MARY BRENNAN investigates why few Fringe events are listed under
Children's Shows when so much is on offer for wee ones
KIDS come first in the Fringe! But only, it seems, in terms of
alphabetical order. There are, in fact, less entries under Children's
Shows than for any other category.
Browse through some of the other sections, however, and you'll find
shows that would certainly appeal to children of all ages. The Mapapa
Acrobats, for instance (listed under Dance and Physical Theatre) or
Embarquez, a brilliant French troupe of female clowns which fetches up
under Theatre. Keep scanning and you easily double, even treble, the
number of Fringe shows that are suitable for children and young
teenagers. The merest glance through the specially compiled Fringe For
Schools programme (already circulated to some 2000 primary and secondary
schools) confirms this.
So why do so many companies shy away from being listed under
Children's Shows? Stuart Buchanan, marketing manager of the Fringe,
reckons it's got something to do with the public's perception of
children's entertainment.
''People often assume there's a drop in quality, even though there are
some marvellous companies doing highly professional shows that would
work well for all the family. So you end up getting companies deciding
not to categorise themselves under Children's Shows, hoping that they'll
bring in a wider audience,'' said Buchanan.
This attitude is definitely not shared by Anthony Lilley of Intimate
Exchanges Theatre Company -- they're bringing a version of The Tempest
to the Fringe, you'll find it listed proudly under Children's Shows.
''People do look down on children's theatre -- but that's because they
underrate young audiences,'' says Lilley.
''You get a quite astonishing spectrum of sophistication between the
seven and 11-year-olds, and you have to be able to meet that. It's
certainly more demanding than your average adult audience -- oh, much,
much harder!'' he said.
And he should know, for -- under another name, Box Hedge -- the
company tours open-air productions of full Shakespeare plays. ''In a
way,'' says Lilley, ''this led us into doing Shakespeare for children.
As a kind of stepping-stone to adult theatre. We wanted to show children
that Shakespeare wasn't boring, or beyond them. And, I suppose, we
wanted to show that you don't need to play down to children. It doesn't
have to be just juggling or clown's make-up.''
Alongside professional companies like Intimate Exchanges, Sphere Clown
Band (from Canada) or Beale Street Puppets (from America) are a clutch
of dedicated newcomers and enthusiastic students. The Edinburgh-based
Chickpea Theatre Company -- making its debut at the Fringe -- is also
keen to lay the ghost of condescension. They too are doing Shakespeare:
an adaptation of As You Like It that is ''full of fun, with really
amazing costumes and music -- because it's important that children,
young people, get to see theatre that isn't stuffy, or condescending''.
As for the Absolute Banana Theatre Company -- well you could say
they're out to prove that theatre is a healthy diversion. ''Thanks to
our sponsors, we are giving away free bananas to our audiences,'' says
William Tait who plays the Judge in their production of Toad Of Toad
Hall. Like many other student companies -- the Bananas hail from
Birmingham -- the group has a foot in both theatre camps: adult and
childrens.
There's no doubt that the Fringe caters for younger audiences. A
weekly Kids Diary ensures that everyone knows where to find those
perennial favourites Mr Boom and Magic Bob. It will also point
interested parties towards stage versions of Roald Dahl, Oscar Wilde,
and Lewis Carroll. The school's brochure, with its special ticket offers
and details of workshops is yet another encouraging indication of how
seriously the Fringe team take the needs of the under-18s.
The next stage is to encourage companies to declare their interest in
that younger audience. Perhaps next year's categories will include a
happy umbrella heading of Family that will allow everyone to enjoy a
feast of story-telling, circus, magic, and theatre without any barriers
to spoil the fun.

Ian Black finds inspiration in a uniquely successful meeting of minds
and motivation which creates an appetite for industry
JIM Lewars is a soft-spoken, modest man, with absolutely nothing
whatsoever to be modest about. Aided and very much abetted by the
Lanarkshire Development Agency, he and his colleagues have produced one
of the work-finding miracles of Scotland.
He is Training Manager for Motherwell Enterprise Development Company
and if you are a graduate and he trains you, you have more than four
chances out of five of landing a job -- and not one of your M Mouse
efforts either, but a position using your academic skills and training.
Of the last 90 graduates that Medco have trained, 75 are now in
permanent jobs, and they were paid #120 per week while training for
them. Starting salaries for the graduates vary but average around
#13,500, so it isn't cheap labour.
In an economy with a huge surplus of graduates and in Lanarkshire, an
area which has seen its traditional industries vanish like snow in a
heatwave while unemployment rocketed, this statistic is little short of
miraculous.
It works as follows, and it is as simple as this. If you are a
graduate from a university or a college, if you are from Lanarkshire,
and you are unemployed, even if only for a day, then you qualify. Medco
will take you in, give you three weeks' training, and then place you
with a company for 13 weeks. During that time you will, of course,
concentrate in becoming so valuable to the company that you become
irreplaceable. That is both the theory and the practice and the very
good news is that it works.
There is no other development company in Scotland which can approach
this success rate. Jim Lewars, when asked the why and the how of it
said: ''I gather together 12 to 15 graduates for the three weeks, and, I
think this is the cornerstone of it, I talk to them about selling
themselves.
''I talk about behaviour skills, teamwork, communications,
negotiations. They go through a programme. They take part in business
games. They run that as a challenge -- just to see how real industry
supposedly works. At the end of this I'd hope that they have learned a
bit personally. They are in a better position to go out there and sell
themselves. They've already got academic prowess and we, hopefully, have
improved the positive side of their personalities. And it has gelled.
It's worked.''
Scotland is full of training managers who would kill to be able to say
those last couple of sentences. How does he do it? ''I suppose the
bottom line is that I'm being myself. I've been in training for a long
time,'' Jim says.
He is now 45 and was with Anderson Strathclyde as training manager
when, in 1991, during one of their periodic down-sizings, he accepted a
redundancy package, leaving on Friday and starting his new job on
Monday. ''I saw an opportunity and made the decision to go. With the
redundancy, financially it was excellent and it was a chance to do work
I think is worthwhile.''
Two people who think that his work has been very worthwhile are Alan
Inglis and Richard King, both of whom were trained and placed by Jim
Lewars and both of whom profess themselves delighted with their training
and their jobs.
They both work for Green Meadow Foods in Motherwell Food Park. Alan is
a BSc Hons in Food Science and Microbiology, and when he joined the
company last August he was handed the job of helping the Green Meadow
Foods achieve the ISO 9002 award. This he did and the company was
accredited in January 1995, one of only three sandwich manufacturers in
the UK to gain this award.
Alan is now trainee quality assurance manager and says: ''I am
absolutely ecstatic about the job. I have been given so much
responsibility and have learned so much.''
Richard, a BA in Consumer and Management Studies, now trainee product
development manager, joined the company in November and participated in
the development of one of the company's new products, the Hotwich, a
ciabatta sandwich which you can microwave and which Richard proudly
claims ''will stay crisp''. He says: ''I am absolutely delighted to have
got this job. Alan Greenshields (Green Meadow's managing director) has
given me the opportunity. I haven't been restricted to my specialism but
have had the opportunity to use my other skills to help the company.''
Alan Greenshields says of Medco and his employees: ''I would recommend
using the Graduate Programme. We have had such enthusiasm and energy
from the lads. We gave them ownership of the two projects and they took
on the work and did it.''
A meeting of minds and motivation has obviously been achieved here and
that is the key to Jim Lewar's success. He helps people motivate
themselves. Of his first two programmes starting in October 1993, both
of 15 graduates, all but two got permanent jobs and he proudly says:
''I'm not telling you their names but two of them have been back to me
looking for advise on setting up for themselves. That is success.''
That it is and more power to him. Instead of keeping Medco wondering
and waiting over funding, as they are, for next year's projects, the
Scottish Office should have a team in Motherwell studying this unusual
success story in hopes of replicating it.

HOW do you make a purple dinosaur come to life? You open a book. And
what about giants? And witches and teddy bears? What about best toys and
horrible creepies? Just open a book, and anything can happen.
This, essentially, is the appealing message that the Edinburgh Book
Festival is out to impress on children of all ages -- and on their
parents too. And to help prove their point, the Festival has invited
some of the most popular children's authors to take part in a hectic
spree of quizzes and parties, games and workshops, talks -- and above
all -- storytelling. More than 100 different events have been devised.
The choice could almost leave you lost for words.
Shona Munro, director of the Book Festival, doesn't denounce outright
those forms of entertainment that can be accessed at the push of a
button. Some books and characters have, after all, gained eager new
readers as a result of serialisations on TV. But she is concerned that
books don't end up automatic second choices -- or even a last resort --
when children are looking for something to do.
While she answers the phone, Munro hands me The Teddy Robber. It is a
picture-story for tots, by award winning author/artist Ian Beck. It
deals with a crisis that haunts some tinies even throughout their
adulthood: the sudden disappearance of one's teddy bear. It ends happily
-- but not before a huge two-page picture reveals the Teddy Robber's
awful hoard: a room full of captive teddies. Shelves upon shelves of
them -- and all apparently different. I was just checking that out when
Munro returned . . .
Munro introduced me to Percy the Park Keeper, Kipper, Wibbly Pig and a
whole host of other colourfully-realised characters from best selling
books. Their creators, Nick Butterworth (the Percy stories) and Mike
Inkpen are both lined up to do a stint in the Festival, while everyone
who passes through the foyer exhibition can dwell on the telling details
in Ian Beck's artwork for The Teddy Robber and other stories.
Alongside plenty of opportunities for sitting back and listening --
I'd love, for instance, to hear Helen Lederer reading the splendidly
noisy words of Lullabyhullaballoo! Various author/illustrators are happy
to lead workshops in drawing and writing. Don Conroy -- one of Ireland's
most popular children's authors -- is a first rate cartoonist, and his
How to? session will find him passing on useful tips to budding artists.
The How to? theme runs through the entire Book Festival -- publishers,
agents and authors will all provide insights into how ideas become books
-- but there's a really practical, hands-on feel to those items
specifically included for children. Eight to 12-year-olds with a liking
for mysteries can gather vital clues on how to write their own detective
stories in a Mystery Club workshop led by Ben Baglio.
And any way of looking at words, or of saying them out loud, so as to
enjoy their sounds and their rhythms as well as their meanings is the
aim of a poetry workshop for the over-10s. Three performance poets, John
Rice, Brian Moses, and Pie Corbett are ready with their own version of
the three Rs: Rap, Rhythm and Rhyme. The message? Don't be averse to
verse until you've tried it!
And if there's anyone left who thinks reading books is boring -- well,
the Book Festival makes it all a piece of cake. There are tea parties
galore celebrating such occasions as Thomas the Tank Engine's 50th
birthday, the 15th birthday of Walker Books, and the mere existence of
Maisie the Kilted Kitten. Oodles of fun to remind children and adults of
the abiding value of books in our lives.
As for that huge purple dinosaur -- well, Shona Munro has her Barney
book ready to open on August 15 around 10.30am.
* Some workshops, activities and free events are for limited numbers
-- you are advised to book in advance so as to avoid disappointment on
the day.

BUJUMBURA: Hutu rebels killed at least 36 people, most of them Tutsis,
in attacks on three camps in northern Burundi at the weekend, state-run
Burundi radio said yesterday. The radio and security sources said Hutu
rebels, throwing grenades and firing automatic weapons, attacked a
refuge for displaced Tutsis in Kabarantwa town in Cibitoke province on
Sunday.
At least 30 men, women and children were killed and many wounded in
this attack, the security sources said. In a similar assault on
Saturday, several people were reported killed and five Tutsis seriously
wounded at a camp in the town of Muzinda in Bubanza province.

Rome
PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today condemned the killing in Zaire of
six Italians, two of them children, as an act of barbarity.
The victims were held up on Sunday by bandits who robbed and then shot
them during a trip to Virunga gamepark, said the Italian aid agency for
which the four adults worked.
''This horrendous crime is all the more vile and execrable in that it
has wiped out young and innocent lives,'' Scalfaro said.Three members of
the same family, architect Adelio Castiglioni, 51, his daughter Roberta,
11, and son Samuele, five, were killed in the attack.

Paris
FRENCH firms faced financial threats today over Paris's decision to
resume nuclear testing, but business leaders played down the risks.
The government of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state,
said it was prepared to start ''economic warfare'' with France over
tests set to begin in the South Pacific next month.
Worldwide opposition to the testing has been growing daily.
Criticism of French President Jacques Chirac's plans to conduct tests
in French Polynesia has been particularly strong in the South Pacific
and East Asia.
As a first act of threatened economic warfare, New South Wales was
prepared to ban Franco-German firm Eurocopter from bidding for a #2.06m
contract.
The Australian government has banned French firm Dassault from bidding
for a #462m contract to supply jet aircraft. Defence Minister Robert Ray
has said state governments should follow suit.
The move prompted Paris to recall its envoy to Canberra and threaten
economic reprisals.
The Victorian state government has already banned French firms from
bidding for a slice of its electricity privatisation programme, worth up
to #6000m.--Reuter.

New York
VANITY Fair magazine today reopened the row over child molestation
claims against singer Michael Jackson by reporting that he and ABC
misled viewers of the Prime Time Live interview in June by saying that
charges against the star had been dropped.
The magazine quoted a key prosecutor, Santa Barbara District Attorney
Thomas Sneddon, as saying the case was still pending and the programme
watched by an estimated 60 million people was replete with misleading
and self-serving statements.
A spokeswoman for ABC's Diane Sawyer, who conducted the interview,
said today that Sawyer admitted to having ''misspoke'' when she told
Jackson: ''You have been cleared of all charges, we want to make that
clear.''
In an interview with Vanity Fair reporter Maureen Orth, Sneddon said
Sawyer's comment was a ''glaring mistake . . . Michael Jackson has not
been cleared. The state of the investigation is in suspension until
somebody comes forward.''
Orth said Sneddon took issue with several comments by Jackson,
including one that the boy who accused him of sexual molestation was not
able to back up his charge by describing markings on his genitalia.
''There was nothing that matched me to those charges . . . no
markings,'' Jackson said on the television programme.--Reuter.

Colombo
A SUICIDE bomber, identified by police as an Indian Tamil, set off a
cartload of explosives which killed 22 people in Colombo today in what
was widely seen as the Tamil Tiger separatists' answer to Sri Lanka's
plans for devolution.
The blast was triggered opposite the capital's landmark Independence
Memorial Hall and wounded more than 40, police and witnesses said.
Police said they had identified the bomber and were searching for his
accomplices.
Hours after the blast, 14 mangled bodies lay around the entrance to
the building in the fashionable Cinnamon Gardens embassy district,
witnesses said. Its windows were shattered by the force of the
explosion.
The bomber, believed by police to be a member of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was asked for his identification papers outside
the office of the chief minister of the western provincial council,
witnesses said.
G B Kotakadeniya, deputy inspector general of police in charge of
Colombo, said a sentry at the nearby state television station, which
some reports said was the bomber's target, saw the man pushing his cart
of coconuts and then the blast.
''The cart was laden with explosives,'' Kotakadeniya said. ''The
bomber had been in Colombo for three years selling coconuts. We can't
say what the target was. The LTTE never goes for small political
offices. They always attack military establishments or places where they
can cause maximum civilian casualties. This was not the case here.''
Kotakadeniya said police thought the bomber was from the northern
Tiger stronghold of Jaffna but later found him to be a member of the
Indian Tamil community who work on tea estates in the central hills.
''It's very significant the LTTE hit the provincial council
building,'' said Arjuna Mahendran, senior regional economist for Crosby
Securities. ''It's a symbolic sort of act, attacking the whole concept
of devolution.''
President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga on Thursday announced a
devolution package giving extensive autonomy to the island's minority
Tamils in a bid to find a political solution to a war against the LTTE
which has raged since 1983.
''The whole house reverberated,'' said a resident living about half a
mile from the blast scene.
A shadowy Tamil militant group which claimed responsibility for an
abortive car bomb at Colombo airport in June threatened last week to
kill tourists and foreign investors in Sri Lanka.
The group, Ellalan Force, believed to be a front for the LTTE, said it
''won't be ready to show any mercy'' unless the armed forces stopped
''killing Tamils'' in the north.
The group, which denounced a current military offensive in the
rebel-held Jaffna peninsula, threatened to set off ''massive bombs'' in
Colombo last month unless a commission was set up to investigate the
killing of Tamils in the east.
A military spokesman said on Saturday they took the group seriously:
''They have proved they have explosives and can do something in
Colombo.''
Political analyst Ram Manikkalingam said the attack seemed to be the
LTTE's answer to devolution. ''It seems they are opting for more of the
same -- hit-and-run guerrilla attacks and bomb blasts,'' he said.
Sinhala-language newspapers today said the LTTE, which has not claimed
responsibility for the blast, were planning to announce a separate state
tomorrow.--Reuter.

Doctors will still find exposing the malpractices of incompetent
colleagues a tough option, says Alan MacDermid
EVEN after he had gone, one of his patients turned up dying because of
his handiwork -- or lack of it. His former colleagues were horrified
that a simple procedure which might have forestalled the tragedy had not
been carried out.
These doctors, some of them junior to him, had spent months agonising
over the instances of sloppiness and bad judgment they saw; they took
their frustrations home with them, until their wives banned any further
mention of his name.
Finally, long before Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell's prompting
yesterday, they turned him in.
The result was a disciplinary hearing which ended with an agreed
resignation, a pay-off (confidential, but thought to be in the region of
#100,000) and his departure for a new job in England, from where he had
come a few years earlier with glowing references. And there was a legal
action by grieving relatives -- settled out of court -- still to come.
Would ''Maintaining Medical Excellence -- The Review of Guidance on
Doctors' Performance'' have made much difference if it had been in force
when he was sending shudders of alarm through his colleagues in
Scotland?
Not a great deal, was the verdict of one of them yesterday.
''You have to remember that we finally did blow the whistle,'' he
said. ''It might affect the threshold for action -- maybe we would have
acted a little quicker if it had been in force.
''But there is always a reluctance to blow the whistle on a young
consultant who is making his way in the world. I don't think anyone felt
inhibited by their contract, but there is an understandable reluctance
to put the boot in.
''To be perfectly honest I am not sure it is going to lead to a great
increase in the number of cases of incompetence being reported.''
What will make a difference are the new procedures being framed to
extend the powers of the General Medical Council. Now passing through
the House of Lords and expected to be in force later this year, they
will enable the council to pursue doctors whose performance or
competence is in question.
Many people probably think that is what the GMC is there for already,
and wonder why they keep reading about doctors being caught with their
trousers down or their hands in the till. It takes fairly towering
neglect of their clinical duties to qualify for serious professional
misconduct proceedings.
Now the GMC will be able to take in hand the doctor who isn't up to
the job, prescribing a period of supervision or retraining, with removal
from the register in the meantime if necessary.
Why then, yesterday's intervention by the Government, with the
implication that doctors who failed to blow the whistle on an
incompetent colleague might themselves face disciplinary proceedings?
It might be as simple as the fact that the UK Chief Medical Officer,
Dr Kenneth Calman, was asked two years ago to lead a review, and this is
it being published. Alternatively, said the whistle-blower I spoke to:
''If you were being cynical you could describe it as window-dressing
designed to show that the Government cares about patients.
''The new GMC procedure is a different kettle of fish. If that had
been available at the time it would have been used. At best Dorrell's
recommendations will make it slightly easier to do what was in fact
done.
''All that the individual has to do is resign, and he is no longer a
problem for the health authority or trust which employs him. He can go
and work somewhere else.
''The only body capable of providing control overall is the GMC. The
new measures will fill the gap that was there -- it is not a lesser
problem, just a different one.
''The GMC has been able in the past to look into conduct and health
but never before into performance and competence. People have used this
as a stick to beat the GMC but they have never had the power. They went
to the Government and asked for this.''
So the GMC's new powers might have enabled them to act against their
colleague with more effect, but not necessarily much quickly. The
whistle-blower remembered the lesson of the Caine Mutiny, when the
evidence Captain Queeg's officers had built up against him was made to
look trivial when analysed one by one at the Court Martial (until
Queeg's own outburst proved their point).
''The evidence has to be evidence that will stick,'' the doctor
pointed out. ''You really don't want allegations flying around out of
malice. They have to be fairly solid. There were solid things in this
case and it was solved eventually.
''The level at which the GMC is going to threaten removal from the
register is still going to be high -- something very high in terms of a
single episode, or more likely a pattern over a period of time.''
And this doctor was not the only one yesterday to observe the apparent
inconsistency in a Health Secretary urging doctors to blow the whistle
on their colleagues, while some trusts have introduced gagging clauses
into their contracts prohibiting them from blowing the whistle on other
matters of concern.

John Linklater charts an extraordinary career as former England rugby
captain Will Carling is plunged into a right royal controversy
He is a man for whom a lot
of things
have fallen obligingly into his lap
BLUFF Bill Carling would have made him a different man, like endearing
old Beaumont, a predecessor as England rugby captain. Billy Carling was
never going to be his style, too prole. Just William has too many
Richmal Crompton connotations, the bad schoolboy with his socks down and
a catapult hanging out of a side pocket, for an English sporting hero.
Willie is for English toffs, or it is a Scottish football winger's name,
but nothing in between. It is significant that he opted for Will.
It is the name that suggests a strong resolve, and assists sports page
headlines: Carling Wills England Victory. Will Scarlet, Robin Hood's
trusty buddy, dependable and strong. Will Shakespeare, the Bard with
backbone, leaving few biographical details for history's tittle-tattle.
Those Wills must have been inspiration enough for a boy who fell in love
with rugby at the age of six and who would aspire to the leadership of
his country on its field.
Professionally, where else would he look, with a name like that, than
the setting up of a ''motivational'' management consultants. He calls
it, with neither irony nor much modesty, Inspirational Horizons. It
offers leadership seminars, at #7500 a day.
The wilful side of Carling has led him into trouble, but his
leadership has prevailed to make him the most successful English rugby
captain in the modern era. He was sacked from the England captaincy
shortly before this year's World Cup when he insulted the Rugby Football
Union executive. He said the game was being run by ''57 old farts''.
It is difficult to imagine what his subsequent apology must have cost
a young blade whose name boasts self-determination. It might have been
more personally expensive than the #8000 he once stumped up to buy
himself out of the Royal Regiment of Wales. But it secured his
reinstatement.
His forceful pushing of the rugby world towards professionalism has
encountered resistance, but it takes a crash tackle to halt his progress
once he has set off on a run. Only Kerry Packer's controversial World
Rugby Corporation has seen him check his stride. That would be going too
far, even for a chap called Will. He held out against pressure to
enlist.
Some speculate that his position may only be determined by an
over-riding ambition to mount a final challenge as English captain on
the next rugby World Cup Final in four years' time. Certainly, the
defeat this time around by the mighty New Zealanders, only for them in
turn to prove fallible at the hands of a moderate if resolute South
Africa, left a taste of bitterness and regret.
Carling's savoir dire deserted him when he described the New Zealand
sensation Jonah Lomu as a ''freak'' who ought to go away, but continuing
commercial enticements, from Packer to the Dallas Cowboys, may yet find
Carling getting his own way once again. Nevertheless, the phrase, even
in post-match despondency, was particularly ill-judged and a reminder of
the sporting obligations entrusted to his position as England captain,
and not always furnished. Will has a bad habit of getting up people's
noses.
The edge that has patently crept into Scotland-England encounters may
have its legacy in grand slam schadenfreude, but an underlying personal
antagonism between Carling and his Scottish counterpart Gavin Hastings
may have had as much to do with respective ambitions over captaincy of
the British Lions. Hastings got the appointment. Carling nursed another
grievance into his motivation strategies.
But the continuing bickerings between the English and Scottish
players, over Scotland's supposed closing down of the last Twickenham
international to deny England the kind of flashy victory to which they
evidently felt entitled, and tales out of ruck about Hastings allegedly
calling Jeremy Guscott a ''black bastard'', testify to a loss of
leadership over rugby decorum. A game for hooligans, played by
gentlemen, and argued by both.
Carling, like most men who enjoy success, has a bad relationship with
failure. His image as the personification of England's rugby revolution,
the dashing, handsome and articulate leader who had galvanised the team
he led since 1988 to three grand slams, makes him poor material for
losing anything. In an era when English cricket has slumped to
embarrassing depths, and when English football has floundered, Carling
has been the darling of the sports scribes.
He would be forgiven if the experience, heady and rare for anyone
leading an English team in any sport outside of equestrianism, had gone
to his head. He is a man for whom a lot of things have fallen obligingly
into his lap.
To be found wholesome by an entire nation, sufficient to be contracted
to make television advertisements extoling the virtues of some obscure
soya product -- Carling as the vegetarian beefcake -- is one trial on
the stability and ego of a male personality. To be told you are also
sexy, and asked to appear topless in a magazine feature, just makes you
an object of speechless envy and resentment. Carling clearly thrives on
it, and it feeds his ambition.
At 29 he is said to be on the verge of serious wealth. Carling has
become an industry. He writes a #25,000-a-year column for a Sunday
newspaper, milks the after-dinner circuit, endorses products and does
paid personal appearances. Inspirational Horizons made a profit last
year of #53,000. The management training company he heads, Insights,
made just #11,500 last year after paying his salary.
As he drives his #80,000 Mercedes out of his #200,000 Victorian house
in Putney, south-west London, he might feel he has every reason to
record a new chapter on the dictaphone for his next book on personal
motivation, or lament the dilatory progress of the game of rugby out of
its amateur status.
So far he has been able to control his image, outside of a rugby
shirt. In a live television interview he brought on his labrador Biff
who endeared himself by defecating on the shoes of another guest. It was
not Carling doing the upstaging, but his dog. His interview manner has
been largely controlled, measured, monosyllabic.
The only sardonic trace anyone has detected in his public appearances
so far has been in his smile. Conceit is not a quality which registers
quickly on the English, but watching Carling on his doorstep, reading
out his handwritten statement to deny any relationship with Princess
Diana, must have spread a tremor of uneasiness around the country.
The posture, the predicament, the wife standing by: didn't it all look
so familiar? To have a sporting hero reduced to the position adopted by
Tory junior ministers and sheepish film stars, this was a new and
uncomfortable Will Carling.
The thought might have been bred, and at this stage it could only have
been a thought. Maybe he wasn't Gary Lineker, after all. That's the
thing about a name like Gary, it has absolutely no side. The day that
Will makes a right Willie of himself, he may have to turn to his own
motivational manual for counsel.

Taba, Egypt
ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said after meeting PLO leader
Yasser Arafat today that some progress had been made towards on
agreement on expanding Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank.
''We made some progress and we are going to continue tomorrow in the
same place at 3pm,'' Peres told reporters after a five-hour meeting with
Arafat and his aides.
An agreement on expanding self-rule from Gaza and the West Bank town
of Jericho to more of the West Bank is more than a year behind the
schedule set in the 1993 Israel-PLO agreement.
The Arafat-Peres meeting at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba is the
latest attempt at breaking a deadlock in negotiations.
Arafat aide Marwan Kanafani said after the meeting: ''I would say it
was a businesslike meeting. We didn't see eye to eye on all the issues
but at least there is a mutual feeling that we should reach an
agreement.''
Both Peres and Kanafani, when asked whether an agreement could be
signed this month, said they hoped it could but that depended on
progress in the talks. Israeli and PLO negotiators were resuming talks
on the West Bank in Israel's southern port of Eilat tomorrow.
In the emerging agreement, Israel has agreed to let the PLO take over
six of the seven main West Bank towns. But the two sides are still at
odds on arrangements for the town of Hebron, where some 400 Jewish
settlers and about 100,000 Palestinians live.
Both sides have also yet to agree on security arrangements in rural
West Bank areas, where most of the 100,000 Jewish settlers live among
one million Palestinians.
Mobilisation by Jewish settlers against an accord, and the prospect of
a complicated implementation process overlapping with Israeli elections
next year, are piling pressure on negotiators, who have already missed
three deadlines.
Jewish settlers resumed protests today against handing more land to
Palestinian control. Last week they launched a civil disobedience
campaign and were arrested in their hundreds by police when they
occupied West Bank hilltops.
Arafat and Peres met in Egypt three weeks ago and agreed to sign a
deal on July 25. But lower-level talks on technicalities appeared to
have remained deadlocked.
Chief PLO negotiator Ahmed Korei criticised references by Peres to
''functional sovereignty'' as the basis for Palestinian self-rule. The
concept stresses building autonomous institutions more than the actual
transfer of land.
''If this is the Israeli concept for an agreement, the whole process
will be seriously jeopardised . . . The (1993 framework) Declaration of
Principles states we will regain land and this is the central issue, not
transfer of authorities,'' he said.
Israeli forces made quick work of evicting Jewish settlers opposed to
Palestinian self-rule and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed they would
not thwart peace moves.
Police and soldiers told about 50 settlers on a hill near Jerusalem
which they occupied that they had 15 minutes to leave, witnesses said.

Wellington
NEW Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today that Wellington would
take France to the International Court of Justice to try to prevent it
from carrying out nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
''The agreement of the leaders . . . is that we should take a further
step to see whether we can get interim relief from the World Court to
try and persuade or debar France from this proposed round of nuclear
tests,'' Bolger said after meeting leaders of opposition political
parties.
New Zealand had for several weeks been weighing the option of a legal
challenge to France's plan to end a three-year moratorium and conduct
seven or eight underground nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll from
September.
Bolger said the government would seek to revive a World Court case
brought by New Zealand against French nuclear testing in the 1970s.
''We will be actively seeking to use the very narrow window of
opportunity available to New Zealand, and probably no-one else, under
the submission that we made in 1973 and 1974, and to reactivate that and
seek the interim relief,'' he said.

Washington
A LEG clad in a military-style boot and olive drab has been discovered
in the rubble of the bombed American federal building in Oklahoma, and
the main suspect's lawyer says it means the bomber might have died in
the blast.
The leg has not been matched by DNA to any of the known victims or
survivors of the bombing that killed 168 people last April.
Its discovery was not disclosed by investigators until today, after
Stephen Jones, the head of Timothy McVeigh's defence team, revealed the
find to reporters.
''It just doesn't fit into the government's neat theory that three
people with little or no formal training in explosives carried this
off,'' Jones said.
A grand jury, which investigates and evaluates cases, is expected to
indict McVeigh and fellow suspect Terry Nichols on federal terrorism
charges by Friday.
A third man, who has been living under police surveillance since
shortly after the attack, may also be indicted.
He is Michael Fortier, who was in the army with McVeigh and Nichols,
and shared their rabid hatred of the government and its agencies.
The prosecution has been considering whether to offer Fortier a plea
bargain: if he will agree to testify against the other two, he would
himself be charged with some lesser offence, one carrying a sentence of
perhaps 15 years in jail.

<HEADLINE>Gold prospectors could be heading for the Scottish hills</HEADLINE>

A NEW report has raised hopes there could be previously undiscovered
gold deposits in Galloway -- but geologists involved in research work
have played down speculation that a rush of prospectors could head for
the hills.
Scientists from the British Geological Survey joined colleagues in
Britain and Europe to produce a comprehensive study, dubbed the Midas
Project, of potential deposits across the Continent.
Scotland was central to the technical report (Multidataset analysis
for the development of metallogenic/economic models and exploration
criteria for gold deposits in western Europe ), which is now up for sale
to potential gold miners for #1500. It will be published in a cheaper
and more accessible form in two years time, when small-scale gold
panners can take advantage of the three-and-a-half-year project.
Senior geologist Dr Phil Stone, based at the BGS office in Edinburgh,
said analysis of rock types and formations in south-west Scotland,
particularly between Glenluce and Moniaive, had produced some
''promising results''. Areas in the Highlands were also scrutinised.
He said: ''The reconnaissance work turned up one or two quite
interesting deposits for gold prospects.''
He said there was no record of gold mining in the specific area
identified but explained that the potential for deposits existed because
of geological activity millions of years ago.
Dr Stone said: ''We are not talking about world-beating deposits but
we could certainly foresee the possibility of small-scale economic gold
mining in that region.''
He added that even a small mine could have a significant impact on the
local economy. Tourism and a thriving craft industry could be built
around gold extraction, he said.
Gold panning has long taken place around Leadhills in Lanarkshire and
Moniaive. Then, earlier this year, Caledonian Mining announced plans to
develop Scotland's first commercial gold mine at the foot of Ben Lui,
near Tyndrum, Perthshire. Experts have predicted that the mine could
contain up to #37m worth of gold.
BGS scientists said the Galloway deposits could be similar to those at
Tyndrum but stressed there was no guarantee of what lies underground.
Gold is currently valued at around $400 per ounce but Welsh gold,
which is used to make royal jewellery, can fetch up to four times that
figure and Scottish gold also sells at premium rates.
Mr Gus Gunn, principal geologist at BGS, said the report, which
includes geological and economic models, also found new evidence of gold
in Brittany and Spain. He added: ''We did not produce a map with X
marking the spot of gold deposits. It is a highly technical report aimed
at providing guidelines for gold exploration professionals in the field.
''We looked at areas where gold may exist and appropriate methods of
finding it. All the examples that we studied in the UK were from
Scotland, except one in Northern Ireland.
''Scotland has reasonable potential for small economic deposits which,
in today's climate, could attract relatively high gold prices. There are
still quite a lot of companies in the UK looking for gold and they
wouldn't do that unless there was a serious intent behind it.''

Are the heat wave and crime wave connected? Kirsty Scott looks for
reasons behind Strathclyde's weekend of murder
IT HAS been a bad and bloody week. Six dead in a 25-hour orgy of
violence in Strathclyde and the memories of three children murdered in
the South still fresh and fearful in people's minds. And it's still
warm. Uncomfortably warm.
Amid the tabloid caterwaulings for a renewal of the death penalty, the
calls for deprivation, and for drink and drugs to be tackled, analysts
have been trying to make sense of this apparently murderous interlude in
a so-far soporific summer.
Strathclyde Police moved quickly yesterday to insist that the violence
in the Glasgow area was the work of a ''mindless minority'', possibly
fuelled by drink and drugs. Psychologists appeared to back up this view
saying the clustering of deaths did not necessarily make them
statistically significant and cautioning against knee-jerk reactions.
''The first question I would ask is, is it a real increase?'' said
Professor David Cooke, a forensic psychologist with the Douglas Inch
Clinic in Glasgow. ''Fortunately murder is still a rare event. When you
get a cluster like this, people immediately assume something special has
happened, like last weekend when three children were murdered. Random,
rare events do cluster like this. If the average number of murders in
Strathclyde at the weekend is two or three, then six is going to occur
by chance quite regularly.''
Superintendent Louis Munn of Strathclyde Police doesn't have figures
for the average number of deaths in Glasgow on a typical weekend, but he
admits that six in the space of 25 hours is the bloodiest it's been in
the region for as long as anyone can remember.
''Every weekend we have some type of violence . . . but I don't recall
there ever having been such a violent weekend for a long time.
''The sensational headlines are causing a lot of fear and alarm,
however. Violence touches the lives of very, very few people. Look at
the times these deaths occurred at the weekend; in the early hours of
the morning. The vast majority of law-abiding citizens are not out on
the streets at that time.
''What we are saying is that the vast bulk of people in Strathclyde
can get about their lawful business without fear of attack. It seems to
be down to a very, very small mindless minority.''
Munn said it was too early to pin drink and drugs on the six killings,
but he acknowledged the part they play in crime.
''There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that in violent crime in
Strathclyde alcohol plays a very strong part. As far as drugs are
concerned, there is a strong drugs culture . . . a lot of it is just
down to plain drugs and drink abuse.''
Across at Strathclyde University, criminologist Dr Nick Fyfe warned
that it would be misleading to try and stretch the recent murders into a
wider comment on crime in general.
''To try and generate a moral principle from that is very misleading,
particularly when the trend in violent crime is coming down. I certainly
think it would be wrong to extrapolate that there was some kind of trend
towards an increasingly violent Glasgow or Scotland because the wider
picture does not suggest that at all.
''There is a parallel here with the children murdered down south,
three in the space of one weekend. Reports have shown that child murder
is incredibly rare. My view is that the fear of crime that can emerge
from things like this, the labelling of communities and the
stigmatisation of parts of the community can be far more damaging to a
whole community.''
If they can't come up with a specific reason for the recent killings,
most observers have been quick to play down the possible effect of the
unusually warm summer.
It is not an area which has been well-researched but there are some
studies pointing to a link between heat and crime, and it is generally
acknowledged by weary cops in the US that when the temperatures rise so
does the body count.
''Yup, that seems to be the way of it,'' said a spokeswoman at the New
York Police Department yesterday, ''but we don't have statistics for
it.''
The Greeks were the first to link behaviour with climate and as early
as the 1700s officials in France had noticed a crime wave corresponding
with unusually high temperatures.
In recent years, a team of researchers in Dallas, Texas, found a link
between heat, weekends and crime, albeit tempered by social deprivation
and some other factors, including alcohol. The study looked at a variety
of neighbourhoods in the city and noticed an increase in assaults in
poorer areas in hotter weather on Saturday and Sunday.
''I know there's a suggestion that crime levels go up in summer,''
said Cooke. ''People are more irritable, they can't sleep properly at
night and many try and refresh themselves with alcohol. It's a whole
series of factors. Heat is a stress, like many stresses . . . I think if
this type of thing was happening every weekend it has been hot then
people should begin to worry.''
Munn, meanwhile, does not see the weather as a key factor. ''People do
lose their temper when things start to heat up a little bit, but this is
not New York, this is Glasgow we're talking about. The vast majority of
Glaswegians are delighted to see the sun. If it makes them sweat a bit
more, then fine, but it doesn't make them want to go out and kill
someone.
''It is probably down to the fact that as the temperature goes up,
more drink is consumed . . . we don't get enough sunshine here for it to
be a major cause of crime, but you will get policemen saying that that
heavy rain is their best friend because it keeps people off the
streets.''

A LEADING Scottish Tory last night welcomed Mr John Major's decision
to draw up measures to stop the middle classes having to sell their
homes to pay for nursing care in their old age.
Edinburgh District Councillor Daphne Sleigh said she was ''heartened''
by the Prime Minister's decision, which she said had come about because
of pressure from Scottish Tories.
Mrs Sleigh made a motion on the matter at the Scottish Conservative
Party conference in Glasgow this year after concerns were raised with
her.
Downing Street admitted that it had been made aware of the concerns
and came under growing pressure to tackle the problem of pensioners
being forced to use their life savings to pay for their care.
The Prime Minister, who has asked his Downing Street policy unit to
tackle the problem, believes the current tough means tests effectively
hit the thrifty who have never been a drain on the state.
The cost of staying in a residential or nursing home can be #300 a
week, swiftly eating up the patient's wealth. Anyone with more than
#8000 in savings has to pay their own way. Those with less qualify for
income support, according to how much savings they have.
Mrs Sleigh, who has an 85-year-old mother in a nursing home, said she
hoped the #8000 figure would be increased to around #50,000 in the
Downing Street review.
She said: ''Pensioners who have been sensible with their money all
their lives could be turned into paupers by the current rules.
''First, they have to sell their home to pay for care, and are left
with no income apart from #13.25 from state benefit. It is clear that
saying anyone who has more than #8000 in savings has to pay their own
way is wrong.''
She added: ''The people affected by the current rule are members of
the generation who fought during the war. They are a proud generation
who work hard, save well, and have a sense of pride.
''These people have made sacrifices and should not have their
livelihood snatched away from them in their old age.''
Measures such as raising the savings threshold could be included in
the Budget, and other proposals to stave off growing anger among the
elderly are expected before the next General Election.

IN THE mansions of the rich and the boardrooms of corporate
one-upmanship there is disappointment; in the country hotels which
combine most chintz with the most modern of bathroom technologies there
is despair. The worm has bested the gunman.
Way back in spring the larvae of the lowly trichostrongyle worm were
making the most of damp days to get to the top of the heather stems.
Then they were digested by the red grouse. An inglorious 12th
approaches.
Tired of the erratic nature of the wild birds they want to shoot on
Scottish moorlands, the foreigners have given up cancelling hotel
bookings at the last moment and like their prey are playing a waiting
game. If this season's returns are better they'll try again next year.
Since the ''crash'' of the mid-eighties when grouse numbers were
decimated, many moors have been struggling. ''We've never had such a
deep trough as this one,'' said Richard Cooke, factor of Dalhouse estate
in north Angus, where this will be the sixth successive season with no
grouse shooting -- a loss of about #60,000 a year.
''We would not dream of prejudicing what little gain we have made
since then by opening the shooting,'' he said. ''It is an enormous
problem. Obviously we cannot pay the labour force indefinitely, although
we have avoided laying anyone off and indeed have taken on one or two
more so that we can do everything by the book.''
According to Peter Swales of the letting agency Holland and Holland in
Inverness, there has been hardly any grouse-letting in Scotland for the
past three years.
''It has tended to be replaced with pheasants in November, December
and January, although the kind of people who want to go grouse shooting
do not usually want to shoot pheasants, but will go to Spain for the
partridges or Tunisia for the sandgrouse,'' he said.
Now 30% of grouse shooters are visitors from overseas. A study of the
field sports business in Scotland in 1992 found that grouse shooting
provided 980 full-time equivalent jobs, many of them in areas where
there was no alternative employment and that British people contributed
#44m to the Scottish economy in shooting-related expenditure while
overseas visitors involved in stalking and shooting contributed #20m.
The current rate for for a day's shooting is #94 a brace including VAT
-- or #47 a bird for shooting your own supper. A good bag for a Scottish
estate these days, he puts at only 50 brace.
The manager of one Perthshire hotel said yesterday: ''We don't go for
the grouse market any more, it's far too erratic. Fifteen years or more
ago from the 12th onwards, you would be tripping over men in tweeds and
guns and dogs and even nannies and babies everywhere, especially in the
Station Hotel in Inverness, and the social side of it would be as
important as the shooting, but all that has changed. The young people
have different pastimes and grouse shooting is for foreigners who stay
in upmarket country house hotels.''
Dr Peter Robertson of the Game Conservancy has carried out research on
more than 100 estates for the past 15 years by counting the number of
birds flushed by a pointer per square kilometre sample in 250-acre
blocks.
''The main factors have been bad weather and disease caused by the
trichostrongyle worm, which becomes an important factor when the birds
are at a higher density. Grouse numbers expand and decline in cycles and
the further south the moor, the shorter the cycle.
''In the South Dales, where the disease is now most widespread, it
would be a four to five-year cycle, but eight to nine years in the north
of Scotland. What is important is not so much what caused the crash as
why has it not recovered. There are a number of factors including loss
of moorland to tree planting,'' he said.
Although grouse moors are managed by burning heather to produce new
shoots and by controlling deer and sheep levels to produce the optimum
balance of grazing and heather, the birds themselves are wild in a way
that pheasant, for example, are not, and therefore more susceptible to
the vagaries of weather and predators such as foxes.
More controversial is the question of whether they are also preyed
upon by birds such as hen harriers and peregrines. No-one is foolhardy
enough to stick his neck out on that one, but the Scottish Landowners
Federation will be represented along with the RSPB and other interested
parties on a UK working party set up by the Department of the
Environment.
Simon Fraser, director of the SLF, is fully-prepared for sparks to fly
on the emotive issue of any suggestion of reducing the numbers of birds
of prey, but he believes there needs to be research on grouse chick
predators.

STRATHCLYDE police tried to calm public fears yesterday after the
violent deaths of six people in the Glasgow area in one of the most
disturbing weekends in the city in recent years.
Speaking just days after he revealed that instances of murder,
attempted murder, and other violent crimes in the region had increased
by 21%, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp said people could continue to feel
safe on the streets of Glasgow, and promised his officers would leave no
stone unturned in the hunt for violent criminals.
The chief constable said in a statement released in response to the
deaths that the upsurge of violence in Strathclyde over the weekend was
of concern both to the police and the public but repeated what he said
on release of the half-yearly crime figures last week.
''Violent crime touches the lives of very few people. Crimes of this
nature are by and large committed by a small section of the
population.''
''The people of Strathclyde can be assured that the overwhelming
majority of them and their families can go about their lawful business
without fear or alarm,'' he said.
There had been eight arrests arising out of the incidents at the
weekend -- six in respect of three deaths and two in connection with an
attempted murder in Cumbernauld -- while four additional positive lines
of inquiry were being pursued by detectives, he said.
A woman, four men, and a 15-year-old boy made brief appearances in
private yesterday at Glasgow Sheriff Court, charged with three separate
murders during the weekend's violence.
Mrs Christine Sawers, 33, and her 19-year-old brother John Halfpenny,
of Scaraway Terrace, Milton, Glasgow, are accused of murdering Mrs
Sawers' 36-year-old husband John in the couple's home in Young Terrace,
Springburn, on Saturday.
There was no plea and both were remanded in custody.
Mr William Wade, 28, of Stoneside Drive, Mansewood, is accused of
murdering Mr James Boyce, 26, of Meikleriggs Crescent, Pollok, in Mr
Wade's home on Saturday. He also made no plea and was remanded in
custody.
In the third case, Mr John Nicol, 21, of Baldovan Crescent, John
Kinnaird, 17, of Balado Road, both Wellhouse, and a 15-year-old boy are
accused of murdering Mr John McFarlane, 46, of nearby Langbar Crescent,
in Baldovan Crescent on Sunday.
It is alleged that they struck him on the head with a wooden baton,
struck him on the body with a sword, stabbed him with the sword, kicked
him on the head and body, and murdered him. The three made no plea and
were remanded in custody.
The other weekend victims were: Mr William Downie, 39, of Tweedsmuir
Road, Cardonald, who was fatally injured following a disturbance in
Sunnylaw Street, Possilpark, on Saturday; Mr Alexander Donnelly, 29, who
was stabbed to death on a stairway near his home in Petershill Court,
Balornock, early on Sunday; and Mr Brian McVicar, 20, of Wood Quadrant,
Clydebank, who died after being attacked by a gang of youths, also early
on Sunday.
Labour's home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said politicians must
listen to the views of local communities if the level of serious crime
in the Glasgow area was to be reduced.
He said: ''I would like to see the weekend as an aberration. But we
must keep in mind that the issue of violent crime is increasing, that it
is related to drugs, and we have to get drugs and violence off the
streets.''
Mr Menzies Campbell, the Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman on home
and legal affairs, called for a broad-based campaign involving the
Government, the police, local authorities, and the community, to
eradicate the social conditions which drive people to drugs.
Scottish Environment Minister Lord Lindsay said the Scottish Office
had asked for a report on the incidents from the police but added that
''it is much too early to be jumping to conclusions like John McFall
is.''
The leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, Councillor Bob Gould, said
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), which has reduced crime by 20% in the
centre of Glasgow and has been introduced in several Scottish towns,
should be considered for parts of the city where violent crimes are
often committed.
However, a spokesman for Strathclyde Police said CCTV in residential
areas would present problems in terms of siting cameras, the privacy of
local residents, and the monitoring of cameras.

EMBARRASSED staff at London Zoo are searching for a rare Senegal
bushbaby lost when Rolf Harris and a television team turned up to film
it.
They believe it is still near the animal house and are trying to lure
it out of its hiding place with its favourite foods, which include fruit
and nuts.
The bushbaby, which is about three inches tall, is believed to be the
only one of its kind in captivity.
It escaped 11 days ago when it was being transferred to a display pen
as Rolf Harris and a film crew from the television series Zoo Watch were
at the nocturnal house to record the event.
As a keeper climbed into the glass-fronted pen and tried to release
it, it saw its chance and made a dash for a gap in the pen's door.
A spokeswoman for the zoo said: ''We are convinced it is behind the
enclosure. We have laid a nest box out with some food inside in the hope
it will coax it out.''

A POLICE constable who was not allowed to work the same shift as his
wife is considering an appeal after losing an industrial tribunal case.
PC Sandy Dunnett, 42, claimed compensation for injured feelings,
alleging that Northern Constabulary discriminated against him because of
his marital status.
When he and his 28-year-old wife, Audrey, returned from their
honeymoon last September, they were told that they would no longer be
working the same shifts. They said that, as a result, they hardly saw
each other.
Mr Dunnett was reluctant to comment about the result and would say
only that he was ''disappointed''. His solicitor, Mr Ian Watson, said:
''We are awaiting the full detail of the decision before deciding our
next step. But we will be considering an appeal.''
Chief Inspector William Murray told the tribunal last week that a
husband and wife could not be compelled to give evidence against each
other, and he feared the legal implications of putting married officers
on the same shift and their ending up in court to give evidence about an
incident.
He said: ''Defence lawyers could allege collusion between officers to
bring about corroborated evidence.''
He added that he was concerned that a spouse could be called to a
scene where one had been assaulted, and the other spouse could react
emotionally.
The chief inspector also feared that public confidence in the police
would be eroded if there was a complaint against married officers
working the same shift.
Force personnel officer Superintendent Alan Moir confirmed that
Northern Constabulary had allowed other married officers to work the
same shift.
He said that the matter could have been resolved within a few days
without the necessity of an industrial tribunal if PC Dunnett had
invoked the grievance procedure.
PC Dunnett and his wife have now been posted to Thurso, but Mrs
Dunnett is on maternity leave.
Chief Constable Hugh MacMillan declined to comment on the outcome of
the hearing until the full written decision had been issued.

SENIOR officials of Edinburgh District Council yesterday ruled out an
investigation into allegations that the authority was operating a ''jobs
for the girls'' policy.
The decision was criticised by opposition members on the
Labour-controlled council.
Weekend newspaper reports suggested that a group of lesbian council
officials were bending equality regulations to get jobs for their
partners in the recreation department.
However, Edinburgh's director of recreation, Mr Roger Jones, said
yesterday that, after discussions with council chief executive William
Blyth, it had been decided not to undertake an inquiry.
''Clearly, we cannot carry out a full and fair investigation simply on
the basis of rumour and an anonymous letter,'' said Mr Jones. He renewed
a call for staff who could substantiate the allegations to come forward,
and promised confidentiality.
Tory councillor Mrs Christine Richard was ''very surprised'' at the
decision. She added: ''If nothing else, we have to clear the city's
name.''
The Liberal Democrat group leader, Councillor Donald Gorrie, said:
''If there is a serious accusation made which is specific, obviously the
council should look into it.''

AN extensive search was continuing last night for a walker missing for
more than 24 hours in the Lochaber hills.
Five mountain rescue teams, comprising 55 people and six dogs, aided
by a rescue helicopter from HMS Gannet, were combing a wide area of Glen
Etive for Mr Robert Sparkes, 57, of Culbowie Crescent, Buchlyvie, a
lecturer in Stirling University's department of education.
He is thought to have been due back late on Sunday night and the
search began yesterday morning after his vehicle was found at Track
Junction, Glen Etive.
Although the rescue operation has been hampered by lack of knowledge
of Mr Sparkes's route, the good weather conditions mean he could survive
if well equipped.
The rescue involved teams from Glencoe, RAF Leuchars, RAF Kinloss,
Oban, and Dumbarton.

FIVE weeks into the job and the Earl of Lindsay is beginning to reveal
his green credentials.
No-one has the God-given right to get up in the morning and drive
wherever they want, he says.
There needs to be a sea-change in the ingrained attitudes of many
people when it comes to transport and energy.
Also, he believes in the precautionary principle -- which means that,
even if we still do not know whether global warming is taking place, we
should still take the necessary precautions in case it is.
The 39-year-old earl's arrival at the Scottish Office to take over
from Sir Hector Monro the remit of agriculture, the environment, and
rural affairs, was greeted almost universally with the query, ''Lord
Who?''
Now the Minister, landscape architect and environmental consultant by
profession, farmer and woodland owner on the side, is being given the
chance to show whether he is the farmer's friend, the conservationist's
comrade, or the businessman's buddy.
Already he is proving enough of a politician to claim to be all three,
and yet be his own man.
Along with landowners, farmers will welcome his disclosure yesterday
that the Rural White Paper for Scotland, due out in autumn, may well
include proposals to improve, streamline, and make the current array of
conservation designations more sensitive.
''Designations are obviously an important tool. We have now, because
of the pressures on the land, to be very careful about the remaining
habitats of ever-more scarce species, and we have to be very careful
about conserving and enhancing the future prospects of those species. We
now realise in 1995 that designations should be applied with sensitivity
and flexibility,'' he said.
Flexibility? That will worry the hardline non-governmental bodies who
want to see greater enforcement of conservation measures. They will also
be concerned at his wholehearted support for the voluntary principle and
partnership agreements, rather than imposed solutions.
In his first few days of official visits, he has met RSPB officials at
their Abernethy reserve, and yesterday praised non-governmental
organisations for their ''ability to deliver at ground level a
tremendous enthusiasm and energy''.
He is a man of the '90s, anxious to talk, make changes, and be
constructive. When examining policy for the 1990s, he sets it against
the 1980s -- a decade he sees as ''rather dominated by emotion and
sentiment instead of cool calm analysis.
''We must get away, well away, from that '80s thing of just reacting
emotionally, to working out what the issues are and how best to respond
to them. In 1990, we saw things that were insoluble in environmental
terms but we have solved many of them and, perhaps only five years down
the road, I believe that some of the greatest environmental nightmares
that people envisage now in 1995 will be solved by 1999,'' he said.
He has words of comfort and praise for business and industry.
''We now realise we need both scientific analysis and cost benefit
analysis. There's no point in delivering a benefit if the cost to the
community or the cost to the taxpayer is much greater than the value of
the benefit.''
The cost-benefit analysis provisions in the legislation setting up the
new Scottish Environmental Protection Agency -- clauses which some fear
will put economic considerations ahead of environmental ones -- are
simply a recognition that you cannot just deliver environmental
objectives regardless of cost, he said.
He also believes it is the job of central and local government to
provide the correct framework for solving traffic pollution and energy
problems but that people need to change their attitudes so that
''initiatives that will persuade people out of their cars on to their
feet, on to bicycles, and on to public transport'' can flourish.
Lord Lindsay spent part of yesterday visiting Glasgow Environment
Centre, which is run by Community Service Volunteers (CSV). The centre
is staffed by trainees who were previously unemployed and now work
providing information on environmental topics to people living in the
Greater Glasgow area
''It's all very well expecting central government or local government
to deliver all the answers but we will never achieve all we need to
achieve unless individuals, communities, schools, basically every man,
woman, and child, does their bit,'' he said.

THE family of an 86-year-old Fife man who lay undiscovered in the
toilet of a doctors' surgery are considering taking legal action.
Yesterday, they had talks with lawyers to discuss the case of Mr John
Ross, of Sea Road, Methil, who lay unnoticed for 30 hours in Muiredge
Surgery last week.
Mr Ross, a former docker, who is thought to have suffered a stroke,
was said to have shown signs of improvement. He is in Victoria Hospital,
Kirkcaldy.
Solicitor David Ritchie, of Leven lawyers F T and D C Wallace said
investigations were continuing and added: ''Legal action is not being
ruled out.''
He was consulted after the family's own lawyers indicated they could
not act for them as its firm already represented the surgery.
Practice staff failed to find Mr Ross when they locked up for the
night last Tuesday and cleaners did not find him the next morning.
The surgery later admitted that procedures for checking and securing
the premises were not followed.

BRITISH Waterways yesterday announced plans to regenerate and link the
Union and Forth, and Clyde canals as a Millenium ''Project for the
People''.
The #75m initiative, which features a reworked scheme to reopen the
waterway link through central Scotland, comes just two months after a
previous bid for Millenium Commission funding was turned down.
The new bid would enable the canal link to be made navigable with a
minimum depth of six feet and completed towpaths by the year 2000, with
the ''fine-tuning'' timetabled for the following 10 years.

TOTAL complaints to ScotRail show a slight fall, despite revelations
that grievances directed to Scotland's railway watchdog rose last year
by 53%.
The annual report of the Scottish Rail Users Consultative Committee,
to be published later this month, will reveal that the number of
official complaints rose to 432 in the past 12 months, up from 282 in
the previous year.
However, these are specific complaints directed at the SRUCC, while
the general level of criticisms to ScotRail -- which manages 97% of rail
services in Scotland -- has fallen from more than 11,100 to just over
9800, with this year's figures almost complete.
The SRUCC figures also fail to note that 1993/94 in turn showed a fall
from 354 complaints in 1992/93.
Most of the current complaints are about late-running trains followed
by lack of information and staff attitudes.
The SRUCC will use the publication of its annual report to criticise
the Government, which it accuses of failing the public.
''The levels of investment are very poor,'' said Mr Bill Ure,
secretary of the SRUCC. ''The managers who run the railways are doing as
good a job as possible with severely limited resources.''
Mr Henry McLeish, MP, Labour's rail spokesman, last night said the
only thing the Government had done was to ''make it easier to complain''
through its Passenger Charter.
He claimed ScotRail, in particular, was facing a crisis and that
privatisation reorganisation, which came in last year, was not working
and that Labour was pledged to create a publicly run and publicly
accountable railway.
''At the nub of this is that, for the past 20 to 30 years, this
country has had no integrated transport strategy, coupled with a poverty
of investment in railways,'' he said.
He claimed the Government was deliberately running down the rail
service in the run-up to privatisation, with morale among rail staff at
an all-time low.
''We are also alarmed by the failure of Railtrack to get to grips with
the lack of investment and the difficulties facing the rail network;
these create ScotRail's problems in delivering services,'' he added.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail told The Herald it was happy that a
concerted drive into improving staff conduct and passenger information
was reaping dividends, with complaints to the company currently showing
a small fall.
''In reality we are not experiencing an increase in complaints,'' she
asserted.
She said complaints were averaging 10,000 a year. However, The Herald
understands that total complaints to ScotRail will have dropped from a
high of more than 11,100 last year to an estimate of between 10,500 and
11,000 by the time this year's figures are finally collated.
The spokeswoman added: ''We are in the top three rail companies for
punctuality and performance.
''Technical reasons for lateness are rare and usually down to
signalling or points problems, which are governed by RailTrack, which we
can do nothing about except claim compensation from RailTrack.
''We are also very aware of staff attitudes and information and are
now 11 months into our Friendly ScotRail course, which is directed at
every member of staff, from ticket collectors to directors.''
She added: ''People are also more aware of the Passenger Charter and
the number of complaints is obviously affected by poeple's knowledge of
how to complain.''
Five months ago it was revealed that ScotRail had to pay #11,000
compensation to passengers after a disastrous year for punctuality.
The number of late trains on suburban lines was so high in the first
12 months of reorganisation that it triggered discounts to season ticket
holders under the Citizen's Charter.
Almost 15% of trains failed to arrive on time on the main commuter
networks around Glasgow and Edinburgh. However, ScotRail did score
highly on reliability figures, with an average of 99.4% of trains
running and a large number of season ticket compensation payments were
not bound under the Citizens Charter.
The Government defended its record, saying the Passengers Charter
meant people are now much more aware of what to complain about.

GLASGOW'S Caledonian University has beaten off fierce competition from
colleges and universities across Scotland to provide a base for a new
study into patient care.
The Scottish Office announced the success yesterday of a bid between
the university -- which boasts the largest and most comprehensive
faculty of health in the UK -- and the Victoria Infirmary, to bring the
prestigious Nursing Research Initiative for Scotland to the city.
The NRIS, set up last November, brings #250,000 in annual funding from
the Chief Scientist's Office.
It will be based within Caledonian's city campus, but will move to a
new faculty of health complex, whose construction is expected to begin
shortly.
Welcoming the announcement, Professor Gordon Dickson, dean of the
faculty of health at Caledonian, said staff looked forward to working
with the study.
''The faculty is uniquely placed to offer broad-based support to the
initiative, not only in nursing but across the whole range of
professions supplementary to medicine.
''Its active and extensive involvement in health care education and
research is a firm foundation upon which the initiative can develop its
aim of improving the care and treatment of patients,'' he added.
Ms Margaret Smith, director of nursing and quality at the Victoria
Infirmary NHS Trust, said the hospital was delighted to play a role in
the study and extend its links with the university.
''The trust welcomes the initiative and looks forward to contributing
to the work its considerable experience as a major provider of acute
services,'' she said.
The NRIS was set up to provide a focus within Scotland for direct
health care research for all hospital patients. The aim of the project
is to improve care and treatment by increasing knowledge of patient care
for nurses and health care workers.
Its director, Ms Jennifer Hunt, said she was delighted the base for
the initiative would be in Glasgow.

A MAN who sexually abused four young girls over a number of years was
jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Glasgow, yesterday.
The victims, now aged 39, 36, 29, and 28, sobbed with relief as Peter
McCuaig, 65, whose address was given as c/o Barlinnie Prison, was
sentenced.
Sentencing him, Lord Coulsfield said: ''I have heard a number of
histories of sexual abuse, but this was an appalling series of offences
which quite clearly have had disastrous consequences for the victims.''
Glasgow-born McCuaig, was found guilty of 17 charges relating to
offences between 1964 and 1979, nine of the convictions were for rape.
The incidents were committed mostly in the east-end of Glasgow, but
also in Bellshill, Coatbridge, Greenock, and Blairgowrie.
Three of the girls were the repeated victims of rape, one when she was
just eight. Another was sexually assaulted when she was only six.

A CROATIAN army soldier threw a grenade into a UN peacekeepers'
shelter yesterday, wounding six Jordanians.
The incident happened 35 miles south-west of the capital Zagreb in
territory retaken from rebel Serbs by Croatian government troops.
UN Major Rita Lepage said a lone Croat soldier had tossed a grenade
into the Jordanian battalion bunker south-east of Karlovac. Government
troops were driving remnant formations of Serbs out of the area towards
Bosnia at the time.
Two of the Jordanians were injured seriously and all were admitted to
the US military hospital which has been set up in Zagreb specifically
for the UN peacekeepers.
The defence ministry in Zagreb said that the commander of a Croatian
army unit was being held for questioning in connection with charges of
mistreating UN peacekeepers.
But it denied that his unit had forced Danish soldiers to walk with
Serb prisoners in front of Croatian tanks advancing on Serb areas.
''Croatian soldiers did not tie the seven Danish troops to tanks, nor
did they use them as a living shield in their advance,'' the ministry
said.
Denmark protested to Croatia on Sunday, alleging that its soldiers
were forced to walk in front of attacking Croatian troops. UN officials
accused Croat forces of deliberately killing at least two and maybe
three peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE>TGWU urges boycott of Pepsi products. Cola giant aims to derecognise trade unions</HEADLINE>

MOVES by multinationals Pepsi Cola and Fina petroleum to derecognise
trade unions in Britain have sparked fears of a rush to exploit Tory
labour laws before an incoming Labour Government replaces them with more
union-friendly, European-style legislation.
Both have prompted swift reaction from the Transport and General
Workers' Union, Britain's largest industrial union, which has declared
it will urge its 1.2 million members to boycott Pepsi Cola products,
which include Walkers' and Smiths Crisps, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried
Chicken, and ballot Fina tanker drivers on industrial action.
Pepsi Cola, which dominates the UK small snack market, employs 3500 in
Britain, out of a global workforce of almost 500,000, has given six
months' notice of its intention to end collective bargaining for its 150
or so TGWU truck drivers.
It had previously withdrawn recognition from General, Municipal, and
Boilermakers members at Walkers' factory in Peterlee, County Durham, and
the two giant unions are combining in a proposed boycott which could see
six million of their combined membership and their families shunning
Pepsi Cola products. This figure could more than treble if the unions
extend the boycott throughout the British trade union movement.
Tomorrow, Mr Brian Revell, TGWU national secretary for food, drink,
and tobacco, is to fly to New York for a three-day meeting with US trade
unions to see how they cope with Pepsi Cola, which recognises unions in
11 of its 41 North American plants.
Last night, he said he wanted to find out how the US unions defended
their members against derecognition moves. Meantime, the boycott would
get under way, although he appreciated it would take some time to bite.
The union is about to send out ballot papers to 125 Fina oil tanker
drivers who will be asked whether they are prepared to take industrial
action, including strike action, to retain TGWU recognition.
Shell and Esso have already derecognised their tanker drivers but,
according to TGWU commercial road transport national secretary Danny
Bryan, at least they ''bought out'' recognition by offering the drivers
improved salaries or redundancy packages. Fina, he said, was offering
nothing and was even threatening to transfer its tanker fleet to outside
contractors.
Mr Bryan stressed that, in that eventuality, the dispute would merely
be taken up with the relevant contractors who would be expected to match
existing Fina pay, conditions, recognition, and bargaining arrangements.
He added that Fina was ''two-faced'' because in June it entered into
an EU works council agreement with its trade unions while at the same
time planning to ditch unions in the UK, the only EU member state in
which such anti-union behaviour would be tolerated.
The company later said in a statement that communications with drivers
had been hampered by the procedures currently in place with the TGWU.
It added that, at the same time as giving notice it was was ending its
recognition of the union, it had told drivers of a 4% reduction in their
working hours without any reduction in pay.
''Fina is confident that its drivers will reject the call to take
industrial action,'' the statement added.
''However, Fina's top priority is to ensure that its customers
continue to receive its products and it will take such action as is
appropriate to ensure this occurs.''

A WARNING was issued yesterday to parents about the dangers of
allowing their children to play on unstable sand dunes, after a holiday
accident in which a Borders schoolboy was killed.
Eleven-year-old Roddy Melrose was on a family outing to a popular
beach in Northumberland when he was buried under a large sand dune on
which he and other children, including his 13-year-old sister Louise,
had been playing.
The other children managed to scramble clear from the collapse but
Roddy, of Showfield, Patterson Street, Galashiels, was trapped, with his
horrified parents sitting only yards away.
His mother Ann, who along with her architect husband Gordon
frantically dug him free, last night urged parents to keep their
children away from sand dunes and sand banks.
Northumbria police also issued a warning about the dangers of
tunnelling in sand dunes.
''Sand dunes and banks are always unstable and liable to collapse
because of the considerable weight of the sand above,'' said a
spokesman.
The accident happened on Sunday afternoon on Cocklawburn Beach at
Scremerston, a few miles south of Berwick-on-Tweed.
The group of children were digging in the dunes when tons of sand
crashed down, burying Roddy.
His parents realised what was happening and pulled him unconscious
from the sand. Former soldier Jim Lawrie, who was passing by, attempted
to resuscitate him before an air ambulance took the boy to hospital in
Ashington, Northumberland, where he was found to be dead.
A spokesman for Northumbria police said the coroner had been informed
and a post- mortem examination was being held.
Mrs Melrose said yesterday: ''It's very difficult to say anything at
the moment. We are all too shocked and upset. But I would warn everyone
to keep their children clear of the dunes. It just shows how dangerous
they can be.''
Mr Lawrie said later: ''Roddy was about two feet under, near the top
of the dune, but it still took us about 10 minutes to drag him out. I
feel bad that I could not manage to bring him round.''
At the boy's school, St Peter's primary, in Galashiels, head teacher
Margaret Bonnar said people were stunned by the death. She said he was a
well-liked pupil who was becoming a gifted tennis player and had been
receiving coaching from the age of two by the Scottish Tennis
Association.
She described Roddy as ''the perfect pupil'' and said he was very
bright. ''All the staff have been coming to the school today to pay
their respects.''
Yesterday, friends of the family were laying wreaths and flowers at
the door of the family's detached bungalow.

MR Tony Baldry, Agriculture Minister of State, announced yesterday
that he had separated from his wife, Catherine, after 16 years of
marriage.
The couple, who have one son and one daughter, have gone to separate
secret locations until media attention over their break-up dies down.
Mr Baldry, 45, said in a statement: ''I am sad to say that my wife
Catherine and myself have decided to separate and lead separate lives.
''Our main concern now is for the welfare of our children and I hope
we shall be given privacy at this difficult time. I do not intend to say
anything more on this matter.''
Mr Baldry has been MP for Banbury for 12 years. Officers of the North
Oxfordshire Conservative Association offered him their ''unanimous''
support.
Mr Baldry, who trained as a barrister, was personal assistant to Mrs
Margaret Thatcher in 1974 and worked in her private office after she was
elected Tory leader in 1975.
He was promoted to his post in last month's reshuffle. Previously he
had been a junior Foreign Office Minister from 1994-95 and junior
Environment Minister from 1990-94.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food
confirmed that Mr Baldry would be staying in his post.
Mr Baldry has temporarily moved his things into the home of his Tory
Association treasurer, Mr Keith Mitchell, while he looks for somewhere
else to live in the constituency.

A WOMAN who received life-threatening injuries when she was struck by
a car as she tried to change a wheel on the A9 has been awarded damages
of #60,062.
Mrs Amanda Blackhall would have received more but a judge decided she
was partly to blame for the accident because she did not drive her car
off the dual carriageway before changing the wheel.
Mrs Blackhall, 28, of Fearn, Easter Ross, suffered a number of
injuries including a ruptured spleen and a fractured pelvis in the
accident on October 14, 1992, on a dual-carriageway stretch of the A9
about five miles north of Inverness.
She sued Mr Dugald MacInnes, of Drumossie Avenue, Inverness, the
driver of the other car involved in the accident.
Lord Hamilton was told at the Court of Session that Mrs Blackhall, her
friend Kirsten Smith, and three children were returning to Fearn at
about 5.30pm after a trip to the cinema in Inverness. Mrs Blackhall was
driving a Volkswagen Passat estate when the front off-side tyre
punctured.
Mrs Blackhall stopped with some difficulty on the inside lane of the
dual carriageway and switched on the hazard warning lights before
starting to fit the jack. Several cars went past on the outside lane but
Mr MacInnes's Ford Fiesta struck the back offside corner of the Passat
before hitting Mrs Blackhall.
She was taken to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, where she needed an
emergency operation.
Mrs Blackhall had a baby a few months old at the time of the accident,
who was not involved in the crash, and has since had another child.
She still suffers pain and discomfort and can walk only about a mile
before the pain becomes intolerable. She has not been able to return to
her job as a shop assistant. Before the accident she led an active life,
regularly walking six or seven miles with her dogs.
Mr MacInnes, who was convicted of careless driving following the
accident, admitted liability for what had happened but argued that Mrs
Blackhall had been partly to blame.
He contended that, before attempting to change the wheel, she should
have driven her car off the carriageway on to an adjacent grass verge.
Lord Hamilton said Mrs Blackhall had wanted to change the wheel as
quickly as possible since she had young children in the car.
The judge added, however, that the puncture would not have prevented
the car being driven on to the verge, which was something Mrs Blackhall
should have done.
''It was possible to get the vehicle off the road. It was dangerous
not to do so given the volume of traffic and the deteriorating
visibility.
''The danger of leaving the car on the road was, in my view, obvious.
To attempt to change the off-side wheel while on the carriageway was
particularly hazardous. In my view, Mrs Blackhall did not take
reasonable care for her own safety.''
Lord Hamilton assessed Mrs Blackhall's contributory negligence at 20%
and reduced the damages he would have awarded from #75,078 to #60,062.

<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey sought to play down
speculation yesterday that Croatia and Serbia were hatching a secret
deal to carve up Bosnia's land mass between themselves.
Suspicions of a territorial trade-off between Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic have been
fuelled by the speed of Croatia's recovery of Serb-occupied territory at
the weekend, against very little opposition.
The Times reported yesterday that Tudjman had used the back of a menu
at a formal dinner in London in May to illustrate his prediction of a
future settlement between Serbia and Croatia.
It reproduced the sketch showing an area marked ''present Bosnia
Herzegovina border'' cut in two by an S-shaped line, with one side going
to Croatia and the other to Serbia.
Sacirbey said: ''We have asked at the highest levels for the Croatian
Government to clarify the confusion that this story has brought about
and I think they recognise that there has been some damage occasioned by
it.''
However, Sacirbey said he did not believe Bosnia's Croat allies were
now becoming a threat.
''There are cynics who might see Croatia going from being a victim to
being a menace,'' he told Reuter. ''There's always reason for caution,
reason to fear there's something we don't see.
''But I think we should concentrate on our shared strategic interests
and not speculate about a Croatia that has opened its mouth wide to
swallow Bosnia.''
The rebels fleeing from Krajina have had no help from Bosnian Serb
forces as they make their way across the northern parts of Bosnia.
This has led to suggestions that Milosevic might have agreed to cede
the Krajina region in exchange for control of Eastern Slavonia, a
Serb-held portion of Croatia bordering Serbia.
Such an arrangement would effectively end hostilities between the two
strongest powers in former Yugoslavia.
One Western diplomat said: ''If that's the deal that's been cut
through winks and nods, which is what it looks like, then there
certainly could be a deal over Bosnia too.
''Bosnia wouldn't have the strength to resist co-ordinated pressure
from Serbia and Croatia and might have to agree to a division. But maybe
there are dissenters. That could explain why Silajdzic and Karadzic are
suddenly in trouble.''
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic resigned without warning during
a parliament session on Thursday evening.
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic demoted his top general, Ratko
Mladic, on Friday evening. The Bosnian Serb parliament backed Karadzic
on Sunday, but Mladic, who enjoys Milosevic's support, won the
endorsement of 18 top generals.
Sarajevo street corners and cafes are buzzing with speculation that
Silajdzic and Karadzic are casualties of a three-way deal to create
three ''ethnically pure'' states of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.
Silajdzic is supposed to have objected to abandoning the multi-ethnic
ideal for which Bosnia has all along said it was fighting the war, and
Karadzic is alleged to want to continue the battle for a Greater Serbia
against Mladic and Milosevic's wishes.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown confirmed last night that he
witnessed President Tudjman draw his map on the back of a VE-Day banquet
menu in London's Guildhall on May 6.
He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ''I think people have known for
some time that there is a propensity to have secret deals between the
Croats and the Serbs. It's happened before.
''And I think both of them feel Bosnia would make rather a nice meal
between them.''
He added: ''The fact of the secret deal is not yet proven. But the
'dog that hasn't barked' these last three or four days is Serbia.''
Asked if he believed there was a secret deal between Croatia and
Serbia with the ultimate aim of carving up Bosnia, he replied: ''I don't
know.
''All I do know is that what President Tudjman told me at that dinner
has proved to be accurate so far.''
Mr Ashdown added: ''I don't think the map should be seen as a plan or
an intention -- maybe it's only a prediction.''
He urged the international community to reflect ''that to retake your
own territory, which you have lost through aggression, is one thing --
but it must be made very clear to Croatia that any attempt to carve up
Bosnia with Serbia would be quite another.''

AS Edinburgh prepares for the festival, a report has highlighted the
lack of facilities for people with hearing and other disabilities in top
theatres, concert halls, and art centres in the capital.
The study, titled Hear Now, was carried out by eight disabled people
at 20 venues to be used during the arts extravaganza, which starts this
weekend.
The group checked the venues for the Dunfermline-based pressure group
for the disabled, the Adapt Trust, which has the Earl of Snowdon as its
president.
Their investigation showed that only two of the festival venues, the
Queen's Hall and the Theatre Workshop, provide ''outstanding'' access to
performances.
Among the places checked were well-known venues like Bedlam Theatre,
the Assembly Rooms, Playhouse Theatre, Traverse Theatre, Usher Hall, and
King's Theatre. The Adapt Trust said ithey would not be releasing the
names of the worst venues. Instead they would mention only the ones
which had won praise.
Hearing systems were available at only 12 venues and the sound
quality, maintenance, and publicising of the systems was extremely
variable. Sight-impaired and blind will find regular audio-described
performances at only four of the 20 venues -- Festival Theatre,
Playhouse, King's, and Queen's Hall. Wheelchair users have basic access
to the ground floor of the auditorium at 13 places but the facilities
vary from comprehensive and well-thought-out to haphazard.
Public payphones were installed at 16 of the 20 venues but only eight
have had a telecoil fitted to enable hearing impaired users to hear more
clearly.
Thirteen of the 20 places visited 13 had no training programmes in
place for staff dealing in disability awareness.
Hearing-impaired people will find a signer on stage for occasional
performances at just six of the 20 venues.

TWO boys were taken to hospital last night suffering from serious
smoke inhalation, after a fire caused extensive damage to commercial
property in the centre of Kilmarnock.
Police did not give details of the pair, who are believed to be under
16, but said a report on the blaze, in West George Street, would be sent
to the procurator fiscal.
The boys were detained overnight in Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock.
Among the properties damaged in the fire, which started at 8pm and
required a major operation by firefighters to control it, were a
bookmaker's, restaurant, pub, and several shops.
There were three other major fires across central Scotland last night.
In Barrhead, units on the Shanks industrial estate at Victoria Road were
destroyed in a blaze.
Meanwhile, part of one of Edinburgh's natural tourist attractions,
Calton Hill, was left blackened by fire. It affected an area of
scrubland measuring about 100 square metres.
Earlier, a community centre in the city's Burdiehouse Street was
destroyed by fire.

SCOTTISH police and forces throughout Europe are co-operating fully in
an unprecedented intelligence gathering operation to prevent next
summer's European Championship in England being hijacked by football
hooligans.
For the past 18 months, forces have been pooling intelligence on known
troublemakers.
Fears have long existed that holding the finals of the championships
in England was asking for trouble.
The reputation of the English fans -- the pariahs of Europe -- is
bound to attract the worst offenders . . . those more interested in
getting involved in fights than watching a match.
Last night, however, an official of the football unit of the National
Criminal Intelligence Service based in London insisted: ''This
tournament would not be going ahead unless we were confident that we
could effectively police matches -- both inside and outside grounds.''
With Scotland still in a very good position to qualify for the final
stages -- much could depend on the game against Greece next Wednesday --
Scottish police have been in constant touch with their colleagues in
England.
While the Scottish football fans have a good reputation abroad, the
worry is that their behaviour might not be guaranteed in England.
Organised hooligan elements in Scotland and England have links
throughout the football season and have contacts with like-minded people
abroad.
It is feared that holding the final stages of a major football
tournament in England will encourage the worst elements in all nations
to come together in a massive wrecking operation.
An official of the NCIS said that a huge amount of preparatory work
had already gone in to preparing for the tournament. Not much more could
be done until it was known who would qualify.
''We are already in liaison with foreign law enforcement officers to
ensure we have good information about those hooligans from foreign
countries,'' said Detective Superintendent Larry Covington, head of the
NCIS strategic and specialist intelligence branch.
Each qualifying nation would be invited to send officers with
specialist knowledge of their own country's hooligans and that would
include Scotland should we qualify.
Meantime, genuine football supporters were urged to contact a hotline,
on 0800 515495, to identify potential troublemakers. Last night, the
NCIS were urging the SFA to display the number prominently at stadiums.
The police build-up to the competition is already well under way.
Meetings, which have involved senior officers from the eight venues, the
English FA, the Home Office, and the Foreign Office, have laid the
ground plans.
While police and the English FA were confident last night that the
measures under way would minimise serious trouble during the European
Championship, they recognised that if there were any major outbreaks of
trouble, it would be a long time before England would be considered
again as a possible venue for an international tournament.

THE mother of Glasgow militant councillor Tommy Sheridan was cheered
from the city's sheriff court yesterday, on her way back to jail.
Alice Sheridan, 57, had sentence deferred for six months after being
found guilty of breach of the peace but left court to finish a 14-day
jail sentence imposed at Greenock last week, after she refused to pay a
#250 fine.
Yesterday, she was convicted of forming part of a disorderly crowd and
refusing to leave the Strathclyde Regional Council finance offices in
Glasgow, in March last year.
She was found not guilty of a similar charge concerning sheriff
officers' premises in Bath Street, Glasgow, a month earlier.
Five other's were cleared of the charges.
Last Thursday, Sheridan and her councillor son were found guilty at
Greenock Sheriff Court of their parts in a warrant sale protest.
Sheridan, of Moss Road, Linthouse, Glasgow, refused to pay a #250 fine
and was sentenced to the alternative of 14 days imprisonment.
Her son was jailed for 30 days after refusing to accept a community
service order, but was released pending an appeal.
Deferring sentence on Sheridan yesterday, Sheriff Mark Sischy said he
found she had taken an active part in occupying the council offices.
The sheriff said he took into account that the Crown had dropped parts
of the charge which alleged she had damaged furniture and computer
wires, thrown documents out of a window, and jostled staff.
During the trial, witnesses told Mr Gordon Crawford, prosecuting, that
a crowd of between 30 and 40 invaded the council finance offices around
5pm.
They claimed filing cabinets were ransacked and documents torn up and
thrown out of a window before police arrived.
In her evidence, Sheridan, a former social worker, said it was a
demonstration against the way council staff were trying to track down
people who had not paid the poll tax.
She told Mr Alan Miller, defending, that she discovered people were
going around private company car parks noting vehicle registration
numbers and then sending to Swansea for the addresses of the owners.
A check was then made to find out if and where the car owners were
employed and then poll tax would be deducted from their salaries.
The court was told that when top regional council officials heard of
the practice it was stopped, within a few days of the protest.

CROATIA has ended its offensive to retake the bulk of rebel Serb-held
territory in the republic, Defence Minister Gojko Susak said last night.
''As far as military operations are concerned, they are finished,'' he
told a news conference in Zagreb. ''Control of Croatian territory has
been fully established.''
But UN officers said fighting was still going on along the Bosnian
border at the town of Dvor between Croat troops and rebel Croatian
Serbs.
Croatia's Operation Storm has swept through the Serb-held Krajina at a
stunning pace since dawn on Friday. By Sunday evening the last
retreating Serb soldiers were pushing towards Dvor, seeking refuge with
Bosnian Serb brethren.
The defeat of Krajina, carved out of Croatia by rebel Serbs in 1991,
leaves only the Eastern Slavonia enclave on Serbia's border outside the
control of the Zagreb government. Croatia says there will be no military
action there.
UN officers said several thousand Serbs were still trapped inside
Croatia and many men had not yet been disarmed. Mr Susak said 5000 to
6000 Serbs in Topusko, north of Dvor, were in the process of
surrendering.
He told the news conference that Croatia had lost 118 men, and another
620 were wounded.
The United Nations says three of its peacekeepers were killed. UN
officials saw civilian and military Serb dead, but it was not
immediately known how many Serbs were killed.
Mr Susak said that some 200,000 soldiers on all sides were involved in
the long weekend of fighting. Two-thirds of Croatia's 100,000 men would
now be demobilised.
Bosnian government troops in the Bihac pocket came to the aid of their
Croatian allies in the attack against an estimated 50,000 Croatian Serb
foes in Krajina.
Bosnian Serb jets have attacked Croat targets in revenge, but Mr Susak
warned them against shelling the Adriatic resort of Dubrovnik again.
''If they continue to shell Dubrovnik, I don't know what the name of
the operation will be but something like Storm . . . will be repeated,''
he said.

DOCTORS could be sacked for failing to report colleagues whose work is
sub-standard, Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell confirmed yesterday.
He was commenting after a review group chaired by Chief Medical
Officer Dr Kenneth Calman suggested fresh guidelines on doctors'
standards of performance.
It recommended the need to ensure that the NHS ''encourages colleagues
of doctors whose practice standards are poor to take appropriate action
before patients suffer or extreme sanctions are needed''.
It suggested that the British Medical Association, the doctors' own
organisation, set up a national helpline to provide confidential advice
relating to all aspects of poor medical performance. The BMA itself has
already considered such a service, but is hampered by cost.
NHS chiefs believe retraining is the best way to deal with the
majority of doctors whose professional performance is questioned. But
the BMA doubted whether health boards and trusts were willing to give
doctors the study leave required to keep them abreast of medical
developments.
Mr Dorrell, anxious that the report should not be regarded as a
witch-hunt against doctors, described one of the recommendations as the
writing-in of an existing obligation of doctors to come forward.
But when pressed at a news conference whether it would be a sackable
or disciplinary offence if a doctor did not report on a sub-standard
colleague, he said: ''It can be.'' A Department of Health spokesman,
trying to put this answer into context, said that it would only be
considered in exceptional cases.
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton agreed with Mr
Dorrell. ''This Government is committed to raising the standards of
doctors' performance. It strongly believes that patients and the public
have a right to expect that their doctor's professional performance is
of the highest quality,'' he stated.
Even Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Carlile, himself a member
of the General Medical Council, was unwilling to be critical,
commenting: ''Those who claim that the new arrangements force doctors
and nurses to be sneaks are seriously misguided. In my view, no
reasonable doctor or nurse would deny that it is part of their
professional duty to ensure that incompetence does not persist.''
The BMA, however, was less enthusiastic. Secretary Dr Mac Armstrong
said it would be difficult to implement.
He insisted: ''This is not about a lot of incompetent doctors. This
report grows out of a very tiny number of very tragic cases two years
ago. In the cases which caused this inquiry, the doctors were actually
ill.''
He also questioned whether health boards and trusts were not being
two-faced. He said employers were trying to push through gagging clauses
preventing staff from talking to outsiders, yet at the same time were
introducing clauses requiring them to blow the whistle on colleagues.
The point was taken up by Labour health spokesman Mr Nick Brown who
stated: ''How can doctors be free to speak out when their contracts are
held by hospital trusts that are inserting gagging clauses in them? If
Mr Dorrell is serious, he should outlaw gagging clauses in junior
doctors' contracts.''

TRADES unions now secure almost 70% of the damages won for people
injured at work, and are fast becoming their only source of help,
according to a study carried out by the TUC.
While some 70% of damages are won through union legal services,
individuals taking cases against their employers are increasingly
unsuccessful and are finding the cost increasingly prohibitive -- partly
because of cuts in legal aid.
Amounts paid out by insurance companies between 1991 and 1993 show
that individual injury victims are winning less and less from their
employers, while unions are winning more -- up from 57% of damages won
to 70% over the period.
The TUC is calling for injury victims to have a choice of using the
no-costs, small claims court to minimise legal costs -- especially for
non-union members -- and the right to secure the cost of proper legal
representation where employers are taken to a full trial, with unions
bearing the costs burden if cases are lost.
TUC general secretary John Monks said yesterday that being a union
member was a vital protection for people at work.

THE operators of the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr have made a fresh bid
to get back in business, claiming they did not want to run late-night
dancing or raves.
Instead, the mother and son, who have a 30-year lease on the Pavilion,
in which Hanger 13 operated until earlier this year, have told
councillors they want to have tea dances, teenage discos, and special
functions such as young farmers' balls.
Three young men, Mr John Nisbet, 18, fron New Cumnock, Mr Andrew Dick,
19, from Glasgow, and Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, from Rigside, died from
the effects of taking ecstasy last year while attending raves in Hanger
13.
Despite Sheriff Neil Gow's comments after a fatal accident inquiry
that there was little more security the management could provide, the
licence for the venue was suspended until November this year.
Now the management is asking Kyle and Carrick District Council to
grant a public entertainment licence to allow functions to take place. A
holder can apply for one-off permission to serve drink.
Councillors have deferred a decision on the licence until next month
to allow Mrs Christine Ridha and her son, Mr Fraser McIntyre, to discuss
the matter with council officials and Strathclyde Police.
At the time the licence was suspended, an agent for the chief
constable argued that there was a threat to public order or safety if
the Pavilion remained open.

WAVES of Croatian Serb refugees crossed into Serbia last night, still
in shock at the collapse of their rebel army and embittered at Serbia's
failure to come to their aid.
Tens of thousands of cars, trucks, and tractors poured over the border
carrying Serbs who had fled their homes in a panic as Croat forces
closed in on the rebel Krajina ''capital'' of Knin.
They looked stunned and distraught after abandoning their life's
possessions and driving for four days in blazing heat through Serb-held
Bosnia.
At a makeshift refugee camp in the west Serbian town of Sremska
Mitrovica a woman burst into tears because she had not heard from her
daughter, who she feared had failed to make it out of Knin safely.
''I have no idea where she is. We can't live like this. I don't have
any family here. People want to live where they were born. I can't get
accustomed this.''
The exhausted, sunburnt refugees sprawled on mattresses in a sporting
hall and tried to escape the heat in the shade, eating simple rations
handed out by local authorities.
The refugees said the swift fall of Knin came as a complete surprise,
believing their stronghold would only collapse after a fierce fight.
Jovanka Milic said she had no inkling last Thursday, the day before
the attack began, that she would be forced to flee the next morning with
five minutes to pack her things.
''I was at work on Thursday (the day before the attack). It was a
normal day, no panic in the air. We didn't expect this at all,'' said
Milic, who escaped with her husband and two children.
At least 30,000 people entered Serbia at the border crossing of
Sremska Raca, according to Red Cross workers.
Authorities expected the number of refugees to climb steadily as a
trail of dilapidated cars and trucks piled high with sacks and furniture
kept streaming in, plodding along under police escort.
One elderly woman said Knin had never seen such a heavy bombardment,
not even during the Second World War. ''I was 13 when there was fighting
in Knin in the last war. But this was 300 times worse,'' said Boja
Miljkovic.
In Bosnia, government troops crushed resistance by rebel Muslim forces
in the stronghold of Velika Kladusa, north of the Bihac enclave, ending
a long revolt against the Sarajevo government.
Its fall ended one of the strangest sideshows in the region's wars, a
Muslim revolt against the mainly Muslim Bosnian government, led by
business tycoon Fikret Abdic, once a rival for Alija Izetbegovic's job
as Bosnian President.
* Zagreb said it would have nothing more to do with European Union
mediator Carl Bildt after he hinted President Franjo Tudjman might be
responsible for war crimes during the offensive. Mr Bildt said it showed
Zagreb had ''chosen the path of war over the path of negotiations''.

SCOTLAND'S manufactured exports fell by nearly 10% in the April-June
quarter, according to the latest export index from the Scottish Council
Development and Industry.
The fall, which came despite expectations of a further rise in exports
when the last quarterly returns were reported in May, is further
evidence that the recovery may be running out of steam.
In May, the Scottish Council was projecting a rise in the index from
161.16 in the first quarter to 168.65 (equivalent to #4330m by value) in
the second. In fact, the index fell 9.9% in the second quarter to 145.1
(#3730m), its lowest level since the third quarter of 1994.
The main culprit appears to have been slack shipments in the
non-computer side of electronics -- microchips; consumer items like
televisions, video recorders, hi-fi equipment, and mobile phones; and
defence equipment.
There was further growth in exports of food and drink, mechanical
engineering, chemicals, and transport equipment. Demand for computers
also held up but the rest of the electronics sector suffered what SCDI's
business information manager Ian Armstrong called ''sharp decline''.
He said: ''It is too early to determine whether these results are
unique or are an indication of a slowdown in the sharp growth of
Scottish exports which has been taking place in the past 18 months.''
The council is now projecting a rise in the index to 159.03 (#4090m) in
the third quarter.
Mr Armstrong also defended vigorously the index's credibility from
attacks by another Scottish economic forecaster, Inverness-based Tony
Mackay. Mr Mackay has suggested that SCDI's provisional estimate of
export growth in 1994 over 1993, a 22% rise, was over-optimistic and
that the true figure was nearer 10%.
''Frankly he is wrong,'' says Mr Armstrong. ''Our quarterly index
covers information from 26 companies accounting for around half of total
Scottish manufactured exports and, with them alone, the annual rise is
already 10%. Our index reports the situation as it is.''
Further, if rather more elderly, evidence on the state of the recovery
comes later today when the Scottish Office releases quarterly output
figures for the production and construction industries for the first
quarter of 1995.

THE Duke of Edinburgh has sailed into another storm, threatening never
to return to his favourite event, Cowes Week.
Prince Philip, who has taken part in the prestigious yachting regatta
for more than 30 years, was furious that he was asked to put a sponsor's
sticker on his boat.
Cowes this year received #750,000 sponsorship from insurance and
financial giant Skandia Life -- its first major deal in three years
since being dropped by Land Rover.
Without the cash, the 850 competitors, including the Duke, would have
seen their entry fees tripled -- in the Duke's case from #21 to #60 a
race.
Like all competitors, he was sent a 2ft by 18in sticker, proclaiming
''Skandia Life Cowes Week'', to put on the bow of his yacht Yeoman
Twenty Eight.
The sailing-mad Duke left officials at a Cowes Week reception at the
Royal Yacht Squadron in no doubt of his displeasure over the sticker.
Last night, however, Buckingham Palace said any suggestion that he might
drop out of the event was ''speculation''.
A spokeswoman said she could not confirm the Duke was annoyed over the
sticker, as his conversation was ''private'', but added: ''Members of
the royal family do have to be careful on the subject of commercial
endorsement and therefore they have to be careful when use is made of
promoting companies and products, when their name is involved.''
Mr Chris Troup, chairman of Cowes Business Association, said: ''He
said he might think twice about coming next year. He was not happy about
having a sticker on his boat.
''I think he said it to focus minds on the issue of sponsorship and
over commercialisation of the regatta.
''I share his concerns. We don't want to find ourselves taken over by
sponsorship and end up like Wimbledon. But I don't think putting such a
small sticker on a boat is too much to ask.
''Cowes Week's problems are not unlike those of the royal family. It
has to change without appearing to change. Moving in the modern world
without losing its tradition and uniqueness.''
The Duke told officials that his daughter, Princess Anne, had
protested when asked to carry a sponsor's logo at an equestrian event.

ENGLAND rugby captain Will Carling was yesterday threatened with
further revelations about his friendship with the Princess of Wales.
The news came as Carling disclosed that he was not planning to sue
over claims in Sunday's News of the World that he enjoyed ''secret
trysts'' with the princess.
Speaking at his home in Putney, south London, with wife Julia by his
side, a grim-faced Carling told reporters he would not sue and just
wanted the fuss to blow over.
But publicity guru Max Clifford warned last night that next Sunday's
papers would carry more information about what he called a ''very
special relationship''.
Mr Clifford is advising Carling's former personal assistant Ms Hilary
Ryan, on whose revelations the News of the World article was based.
He told Carlton TV's London Tonight programme: ''There is going to be
a lot more of the same, coming not just from Hilary Ryan, but from other
people who are aware of this very special relationship.''
Ms Ryan, who was sacked four weeks ago, told the newspaper that
Carling and Diana swopped nicknames and gifts, and claimed Carling had a
special phone to take her calls.
She was quoted as saying: ''He's been running round after her like a
puppy.''
Yesterday morning, a sombre-looking Carling told reporters he would be
speaking to his lawyers about the possibility of legal action against
the News of the World. But by evening he had decided against a court
battle.

THE Government is expected to confirm later today that Assessment
Services, a subsidiary of Siemens, the German industrial conglomerate,
has been chosen as preferred bidder for the National Engineering
Laboratory at East Kilbride.
Coinciding with that decision, The Herald has learned that NEL's
present director, Mr Bill Edgar, is poised to take up a main board
appointment with the Aberdeen-based offshore services and engineering
specialists, the Wood Group.
Siemens, which last week opted for Tyneside rather than Clydeside for
its new 1800-job semiconductor fabrication plant, has apparently outdone
ScottishPower in the race to buy NEL, whose 225 scientists and engineers
carry out applied research for Government departments and private
industry.
ScottishPower sources have confirmed that the power utility, locked in
a #1000m contested battle for control of Manweb, one of the English
regional electricity companies, is no longer interested in NEL.
Mr Edgar's departure for Aberdeen, as a group director and managing
director of Wood Group's engineering and logistics division, was
announced to senior staff there last Friday.
Yesterday, Sir Ian Wood, chairman and managing director of the
family-controlled group, would add only that a full public announcement
involving other senior changes at Wood Group would be made next week.
Engineering and logistics -- with operations in the UK, Norway, the
United States, Malaysia, and Australia -- is Wood Group's main offshore
division, involving life of field support to oil companies like Shell on
the Brent field.
It is currently the responsibility of Mr Bill Carr, who joined the
group in 1975.

MANY multiple sclerosis sufferers are risking their health and their
freedom to gain relief from their symptoms with cannabis, a scientist
claimed yesterday.
Dr Roger Pertwee, a pharmacologist at Aberdeen University, wants to
carry out a clinical trial to test the efficacy of the banned drug.
He has already carried out a survey of more than 50 users -- contacted
through an intermediary -- and is now analysing the results.
''Cannabis is claimed by MS sufferers to reduce pain and muscle
spasms, and improve bladder control,'' he said yesterday. ''We would
like to mount a clinical trial to test these claims.
''This is still at an early stage. The next step will take well over a
year. We will have to get Home Office permission, ethical approval, and
funding.''
The project has not been costed yet but could cost in excess of
#100,000.
''It is difficult to get in direct contact with users because what
they are doing is illegal, but we have done a parallel survey in the USA
were they got a similar number of responses,'' said Dr Pertwee.
''It was legal to prescribe cannabis until 1971, when the Misuse of
Drugs Act came into force. They were worried about increasing
recreational use of cannabis.''
0 He added: ''Now people have to smoke it and run the risk of cancer.
There are other ways, like eating in cake or drinking it, but it is more
difficult to control the dose that way, because they are buying it from
illicit dealers and the strength isn't consistent. If they smoke it they
know immediately when they have had enough.''
According to ''Which? Way to Health'' magazine, which reports Dr
Pertwee's survey today, there may be some truth in the MS sufferers'
claims -- the brain makes a similar chemical that seems to be linked
with muscle movement and pain perception.

THE Duke and Duchess of York put on a very public display of affection
at a charity golf tournament yesterday.
They laughed and chatted in a show of togetherness before the duke
leaned over to kiss his estranged wife on the lips.
The tournament at Wentworth, Surrey, drew large crowds. It was held to
raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association, of which the
duchess is president.
Posing for photographs, the couple placed their arms around each
other, and looked at ease and happy.
Sports and TV celebrities including comedian Bruce Forsyth, footballer
Gary Lineker and boxer Henry Cooper all greeted the duchess before the
day's golf began.
The event also attracted sports commentator Jimmy Hill, rugby players
Jeremy Guscott and Rory Underwood, footballer Gordon Strachan, and
snooker's Dennis Taylor.
The duchess, in a summer dress of navy blue and grey, joked with her
husband on the first tee before the beginning of the Duchess of York
Golf Tournament.
After driving into the rough, the duke, who had already joked with
photographers about his golfing ability, turned to kiss the duchess on
the lips before striding off.
The duke led the Scottish Mutual Team in the 27-team tournament. He
was expected to attend a charity reception with his wife at the
clubhouse last night.

THE BBC and Rangers Football Club have patched up their differences
after the club called off its ban on the corporation imposed for showing
Paul Gascoigne's flute miming incident.
Rangers were angry that the BBC had bought film footage of the club's
friendly against Steaua Bucharest and then showed Gascoigne's
controversial mime of playing a flute like an Orange Walk enthusiast
after scoring a goal.
The club's commercial manager, Mr Bob Reilly, wrote to the BBC,
withdrawing press facilities and banning the BBC from interviewing its
players.
Yesterday both organisations issued a statement, which said: ''The BBC
and Rangers Football Club are pleased to confirm that the recent dispute
created by a genuine misunderstanding has now been resolved, and that
the normal positive relations between the two organisations have been
resumed.''
Neither side was willing to add much. Mr Reilly was unavailable to
speak to the press. The BBC wished to stick to the statement.
It is understood, however, that the BBC has made no concessions to the
club and has given no undertaking about what it can, or cannot use, on
future occasions.

<HEADLINE>Portillo condemns Croatia's cleansing. Huge aid task ahead for UN.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

By Our Foreign Staff
DIVISIONS between the Western allies opened up last night as Britain
broke ranks with the United States and accused Croatia of mass ethnic
cleansing.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo firmly rejected comments by US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Croatia's quick victory in
the Krajina region was a new basis for a negotiated peace settlement.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also wrote a ''tough and direct''
letter to his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic, warning him to respect
human rights and voicing concerns about the refugee crisis.
Mr Portillo said: ''Where people are driven from their homes and where
they have lived in those places for generations, that amounts to ethnic
cleansing,'' he said, as a United Nations-brokered ceasefire between
Croatia and rebel Serbs collapsed.
''Of course, the warring parties believe that if you shift enough
people around the map you can eventually arrive at territorial integrity
which will be a basis for some sort of settlement.''
However, Mr Portillo stressed that the warring factions had never
accepted that that process was over.
He said: ''When one has grabbed territory, another has entered to grab
territory back.
''From the civilised world's point of view, a conclusion which is
reached based on shifting hundreds of thousands of people and in the
process killing tens of thousands more is just not an acceptable way of
moving towards a peace settlement.''
As a United Nations agreement to evacuate up to 80,000 defeated rebel
Serbs from Croatia collapsed, Mr Portillo called on the international
community to renew its efforts to establish peace.
''The object of international efforts must be to bring the parties to
the negotiating table, to establish a map, to establish a ceasefire, and
then allow the UN to police that ceasefire and continue its humanitarian
work, helping those people who have been displaced and bereaved,'' he
added.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, back in the Kremlin after a heart
attack, launched a personal bid to end the conflict by inviting the
Croatian and Serbian presidents for talks in Moscow.
Offering to mediate between Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic and Croatia's
Franjo Tudjman, Mr Yeltsin told reporters that Russia was sticking to
its policy of trying to end the fighting by political methods and not by
force.
However, in a sign of deepening Russian concern, he said for the first
time that if peace efforts failed, the international community might
have to resort to using force.
Aid agencies struggled to cope with the massive human tragedy
unfolding in the former Yugoslavia.
Britain was expected to despatch a further 20 aid trucks and drivers
to help the relief operation.
Columns of between 120,000 and 200,000 terrified refugees were
reported to be on the move.
Roads from Croatia across Bosnia to Serbia were jammed with tailbacks
of up to 30 miles at the eastern Bosnian border with Serbia.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said 60,000 refugees
were on the move from Sector North in Croatia towards the Bosnian Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka and Serbia itself.
A further 30,000 were reported to be moving from Sector South, while
30,000 were already in Banja Luka.
''It is a human catastrophe,'' said UNHCR spokesman Ray Wilkinson.
''It is possibly the biggest single movement of refugees we have seen in
the former Yugoslavia.''
A UNHCR convoy of 13 trucks was on its way from the Serbian capital
Belgrade to Banja Luka with flour, beans, salt, oil, and soap.
A second convoy of 10 trucks from the Overseas Development
Administration with a team of 12 British drivers left the Croatian
capital, Zagreb, for the enclave of Bihac with desperately needed food
aid.
''We are stretched to the limit,'' said Mr Wilkinson. ''We are already
trying to help and feed four million people in the former Yugoslavia and
this just adds to the problem.''
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which had predicted an
imminent human disaster, began to stockpile goods in the region in
January so that the immediate needs of 50,000 people a week could be
met. It will not be enough.
The majority of refugees arriving in Banja Luka are the elderly,
women, and children.
''They are arriving in a terrified, emotional, dehydrated, and
exhausted state,'' said the Red Cross. ''Water continues to be a
priority for the Red Cross and emergency water distribution points have
been set up.''
The speed of the Croat victory, which completely transformed the map
of the former Yugoslavia in just three days, caught Western governments
by surprise.
The late movement of Serbian tanks and troops towards the Croatian
border was seen purely as precautionary -- a warning to Croatia not to
threaten Serbian territory.
Confusion has been intensified with the public schism between Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and army chief Ratko Mladic and the
internal row between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and other
leading ministers.
''There will have to be a major reassessment of the situation because
of the big shift in the balance of power,'' said a British official.
In Belgrade, Dr Karadzic denounced Serbia's President Milosevic,
blaming him for the collapse of Krajina.
Flanked by top aides who have been supporting him in a power struggle
with his own generals, Dr Karadzic appeared on Bosnian Serb television
to claim that the withdrawal and the evacuation of civilians from
Krajina had been ''directed from Belgrade''.
''At this crucial historical moment for our survival in our
centuries-old homes, defence and unity are our only safety,'' he said.
Belgrade's news media denounced Dr Karadzic. The pro-government
newspaper Politika wrote that ''Karadzic, a gambler from Pale, now risks
losing much more in the political roulette game he himself began. His
gamble can destroy hundreds of thousands more people''.
State television denounced his ''lust for power'' calling him and the
members of parliament who support him ''a handful of war profiteers''.
* The deputy general secretary of the STUC is set to return to Bosnia,
despite being shelled and shot at on a visit last week.
At a news conference in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Bill Speirs said he had
been chosen as a Scottish delegate to the fourth Helsinki Citizens
Assembly, due to be staged in Tuzla in October.
Mr Speirs, who delivered mining safety equipment worth #8000 and #7000
in cash to miners in Tuzla, described how a car he was in was shot at
near Sarajevo and a shell landed 50 yards away as he waited for a bus in
Mostar.
He said people of all ethnic backgrounds faced a desperate and
uncertain future in Bosnia and parts of Croatia.
He said a political solution and aid strategy would have to be found
urgently.
Mr Speirs said the Tuzla assembly, representing civic organisations
from around Europe, would strive to seek peace in the former Yugoslavia.
He will produce a full report of his visit to the Balkans for the STUC
general council.

A GLASGOW councillor with parliamentary ambitions is being
investigated by the Fraud Squad following allegations that he exceeded
the permitted level of expenses during the single-tier elections last
April.
A police spokesman confirmed yesterday that the Fraud Squad was
investigating a report on the election expenses of Councillor Mohammed
Sarwar, who won Pollokshields East with a majority of 913.
As well as being a city councillor, Mr Sarwar is a major player in the
Scottish political scene. He is on the executive of the Scottish Labour
Party and is involved in a struggle with two sitting MPs, Mike Watson
and James Dunnachie, to be his party's nominee in the new Govan
constituency.
Mr Sarwar said: ''A number of allegations have been made against me in
the past, so this is not something new. I get so used to these things
now that I don't get upset about them. I just have to live with them. As
for my election expenses, I was not overspent.''
