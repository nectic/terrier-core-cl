Chairman John McGuckian commented that current trading for the second
half of the year was healthy but that the revenue growth levels, in
common with those experienced by the rest of ITV, were well below those
achieved in the first six months, and it was expected that this trend
would continue for the rest of the year.

CAROLE WODDIS finds contemporary resonances in a new theatre
production of the Patrick Hamilton, Broadway classic Gaslight
AS director Keith Baxter puts it: ''There's something in human nature
that we never lose about enjoying being frightened.''
Talking about his new production of Patrick Hamilton's classic
Gaslight Baxter adds: ''Of course audiences have changed in the 50 years
since it was first seen, but I think -- I hope -- they'll take it as
something more than simply a thriller.
''I hope they'll see that it has something to say about sexual
perversity and thralldom -- as a story of two, or rather three people,
locked into an emotional crisis that has as much to say as Pinter's The
Birthday Party.''
Hamilton's Gaslight is nothing if not an exercise, like Pinter, in
atmospheric horror -- the manipulation of a vulnerable woman by a cruel,
if charming husband with a very specific plan in mind. Pinter, of
course, is of another world to Hamilton.
But in a strange sort of way, perhaps Hamilton with his fascination
for the perverse workings of the mind (he himself suffered from deep
depressions) is a forerunner of the Pinter who has an uncanny knack also
of tapping into the darker reaches of the unconscious.
At any event, Hamilton, author of the equally eerie Rope, managed with
Gaslight -- revived by Baxter in a new production starring Frank Finlay
and Jane How and opening in Glasgow next month -- to write one of the
most popular thrillers of the 40s and immediate post-war period.
Certainly it ran on Broadway for three years, the longest running
foreign play at the time, 1941, to do so and was quickly turned into a
film, after its 1938 London premiere (when the part of the terrorised
Mrs Manningham was taken by Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies) with Anton Walbrook
and later in the US by director George Cukor when it starred Ingrid
Bergman as the unfortunate Mrs M and Charles Boyer as her sadistic
husband.
Hamilton's knack was to mix several ingredients: marital insecurity, a
spooky sense of foreboding together with straightforward Victorian
melodrama and add an inspirational bit of stage business, the lowering
of the drawing room gaslight at certain strategic moments -- a
combination in the right hands calculated to create tension and
apprehension in most audiences.
Baxter remembers the films dimly, but says it wasn't until he re-read
the play that he realised he didn't really know the story at all.
''Hamilton was such a wonderful writer but he also has such a wonderful
sense of theatre.
''Re-reading the play and his novels, you also realise there's a
tremendous sexual pulse -- a very dark one -- running throughout his
work. In the film, Bergman is a young woman being terrorised by an older
husband. It's quite clear in the play though that the woman is in thrall
to her husband who in his turn has begun to show affection for a much
younger maid.''
Chiming in with our own times, Baxter's sees Mrs Manningham's
predicament as much more to do with a woman almost fatally undermined by
her fear of losing her husband's affection. ''We know enough now,'' he
says, ''about emotional -- and physical -- abuse and how a woman will
cling to the man who is abusing her. For Mrs Manningham there's no place
to go.''
Baxter's Mrs Manningham is Jane How, a tall statuesque beauty with
Scottish connections on both sides of the family (Ayrshire and St
Andrews). Best known, apart from her time as Jan Hammond, Dirty Den's
girlfriend in EastEnders, for light comedy and indeed, with more than a
touch of the Maria Aitkens about her, How recognises other contemporary
parallels.
She says: ''The psychological games are really quite applicable in any
relationship that's gone very sour. Patrick Hamilton's parents were
alcoholic and so was he. You can see all those alcoholic, manipulative
games coming into play in this. It's quite credible what he does, how he
treats her.''
Baxter is perhaps taking slight liberties with Hamilton by making the
husband considerably younger than Mrs Manningham. But it intensifies her
psychological dependence -- both in late Victorian and modern terms: the
need for any show of affection from him on the one hand and as a woman
grateful to have been finally saved from ''being on the shelf'' on the
other.
''I think though,'' says How, ''Hamilton had really latched on to
that Victorian obsession of 'women going mad' -- you know, the Mrs
Rochesters going mad once a month who could probably now be cured with
hormones. There is, too, that terrible thing of when you're in a really
bad relationship you know it's all heading towards something -- but you
can't actually get off that road.''
* Gaslight runs at the Theatre Royal in Glasgow from October 2 to
October 7.

THE City will be on tenterhooks this morning as it awaits confirmation
that Hutchison Telecom will float the Orange mobile phone network in
perhaps six months time.
Almost all the attention is understandably focused on British
Aerospace, which holds a minority 31.5% stake. BAe's shares spurted
ahead another 36p to 735p yesterday to make a total gain of 85p since
the good half-time figures last Thursday, boosting the overall market
capitalisation to #3600m.
An Orange market value of well over #2000m is on the cards, which
would be worth perhaps #750m to BAe. After a slow start the system now
has more than 230,000 subscribers. That may be small beer compared with
the two million of Vodafone -- Cellnet has a similar number -- but
thanks to later start-up, its system is entirely digital and has more
capacity than the now somewhat dated analogue technology of its two
giant rivals.
So far Orange has invested about #450m and it is thought that by the
time the remaining gaps in the system are filled the overall bill will
rise to almost #1200m. BAe has so far lent about #300m towards the
development but telecoms cannot be seen as a core actvity for the
aerospace group, which in the last couple of years has found itself
piloted more surely than at any time in its existence by chief executive
Dick Evans.
Hence the decision to have a public flotation with Goldman Sachs and
Kleinwort Benson appointed as advisors.
Yesterday morning Hutchison said an anouncement would be made in the
afternoon but that was postponed -- presumably until today.
The holding will be a useful defensive weapon in the armoury that BAe
needs to build up against the probable bid from GEC, although there will
in all likelihood be a breathing space until the Weinstock succession
problem has been resolved and a new managing director who has the
support of the whole GEC board has been installed.

THE investment trust sector has seen a huge expansion in the number of
companies quoted. The 1993 market upsurge and a general re-rating of
trusts spawned a multitude of specialists covering virtually every
equity market in the world from Chile to Korea and several market
sectors like environmental and pharmaceutical shares.
It was not so long ago that the old generalist trusts were widely
considered obsolete and only fit for breaking up so that investors could
put their money in the real growth stories of tomorrow. Trusts like
Alliance and its sister Second Alliance have seen many investment
fashions come and go. After all they have been in existence since the
1880s.
What they and others like them have tried to do is to provide
consistent sound performance not just over years but over decades. In
the past 10 years, each #1000 of assets in Second Alliance has increased
to #3600 and #1000 invested 10 years ago would now be worth #4530 if
income was reinvested. These results were about in line with the average
for its sector.
The performance compares favourably with most other trusts which go
back that far, with the exception of the Far Eastern specialists which
exclude Japan.
No serious investor is going to risk putting a high proportion of his
funds into a single country or even a single geographical region. He
will want a spread which is exactly what the generalists provide, though
admittedly they do have a bias towards the UK and US, which reflects the
need to supply a reasonable dividend income.
There is a lot to be said for investors and regular savers wishing to
put money into stocks markets for the long-term -- meaning five years
minimum -- simply to ignore all the competing investments and put their
money in the tried and tested formula of the general investment trusts.

THE ScottishPower assault on Manweb has now entered the last lap and
the final bid and defence terms are on the table. So the time for a
decision has finally arrived for the latter's shareholders.
There certainly is merit in Manweb's objection that the price does not
contain a high enough premium for control or for the integration
benefits which ScottishPower will derive.
Clearly the price cannot fully reflect these factors or there would be
little point making the bid in the first place. The point is how long it
might take for Manweb shares to surpass the value of the bid should the
group remain independent.
The defence package from Manweb is said to be worth 926p but this
depends on the rump share price being 376p, based on a comparison with
Norweb. However, whether they would command a similar rating is
uncertain to say the least given that Manweb's financial position would
look even more stretched.
Faced with this doubt and the certainty of a capital gain by accepting
the revised bid terms, the latter look the best choice. The whole affair
leaves a slightly unpleasant taste in the mouth though. The other bids
in the sector have all been agreed deals and ScottishPower's aggressive
approach does indeed smack of an attempt to secure control of one of the
weaker English distributors on the cheap.
At least an attempt at an agreed deal could have been made before the
first full onslaught, which is bound to have upset Manweb employees,
with whom ScottishPower will have to work if it wins the battle. It is
also likely to have caused some ill-will among customers. The
contemptuous dismissal of the abilities of Manweb's top management can
only have made them more determined to fight to the bitter end. The
small extra expense of an agreed offer would have been well worth it.

GREENOCK is to become a unique computer help centre for the whole of
Europe, it was revealed yesterday. And it will mean 200 new jobs as
computer giant IBM expands its customer services unit.
By the end of next year, people with computer problems throughout
Europe will receive help from multi-lingual experts sitting in Greenock.
State of the art technology will divert auser in difficulties to a
fluent speaker of his or her native language.
IBM Help Centre manager Paul McNutt said people phoning 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year would never suspect they were calling abroad. ''We
can take calls from parts of Europe and transfer them here and the
object is the customer does not know that. For the price of a local call
it is tranferred here to Scotland,'' he said.
So far this year computer users from across the UK, Ireland,
Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and France have been slotted into the
centralised system. The Netherlands, Spain and Austria will join before
December, while Germany, Italy and Portugal are further down the line.
David Winn, IBM's general manager for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, said Greenock had been selected because it already had a
manufacturing base employing 3000 people. This would allow a greater
concentration of expertise than if IBM employees were scattered in
pockets across Europe.
Mr Winn revealed that 70% of the operators would come from Scotland
and hopefully 40% would be from the local area. ''The reason we are
taking the trouble -- because it is trouble to run a multi-language
helpline -- is because of the better service we can provide.''
On average, he said, 1000 calls were already being received every day
which should increase to around 3000 once the service is fully
operational. Mr McNutt said it was possible IBM would take on more
employees in the future.

MAYBE it will turn out to have been a forlorn wish but Tommy Burns was
entitled to declare his hope that the first Old Firm meeting of the
season will be a game of good, entertaining football.
''Rangers have some super players and so do we,'' he said, ''I would
like to think we could entertain the fans. They pay so much money
nowadays and incur such heavy travelling costs that they deserve to see
something special. Our intention this season certainly is to give them
that.''
He was not alone in suggesting that the baddest game in town might,
for a change, be a goodie. His experienced international defender, Tommy
Boyd, thought so, too. ''It should be an open game, with plenty of good
football. There is plenty of quality in both teams. It can be too hectic
at times, and no doubt the pace will be the usual, but there is talent
in the sides and they could make it an entertaining night.''
Both Celtic men fervently want victory first and foremost, like every
Parkhead or Ibrox sympathiser, but they would rather like it to be
accompanied by a performance which pleases the eye. They can be sure
Rangers would feel the same but on all known track records this is not a
likely bonus.
Burns has to make decisions about his line-up this morning. Three
players have to be assessed before the team is picked. All three --
Pierre van Hooydonk, Phil O'Donnell and Andreas Thom -- will play if
they are ready, and Burns is hopeful all of them will get clearance to
take part.
O'Donnell, scorer of the goal in the 1-1 draw with Motherwell,
suffered what he called a ''niggle'' near the end but seemed confident
enough he would be fit to play. Van Hooydonk missed that game and the
midweek trip to Batumi after having been injured against Aberdeen last
Sunday, while Thom was left out of Saturday's side because of a knock.
Ideally, Burns would want the two foreigners up front, considering how
well they have combined to date, but he has the experienced Andy Walker
ready to carry on if required. He also has John Hughes back after
suspension ready to sample his first Old Firm match, like Thom, if he is
fit.
If O'Donnell is OK, Burns may consider putting Paul McStay on the
bench, and bringing him on later. However, McStay made such a pleasing
return after an absence of four months that the chances are the manager
will prefer to see him on from the start.
McStay and his team mates have been relishing the prospect of the
first meeting with Rangers at the revamped Parkhead this season, but
they had anticipated it being the league match a week on Saturday. Now
it is a play-to-the-finish Coca Cola Cup, quarter-final 10 days earlier.
Burns pointed out that his team were said to be going through a test
at Pittodrie last week, again against Batumi and then, after their
travelling marathon, against Motherwell. They won two and drew won, with
the manager pleased with their efforts all through.
Other than score more goals, he didn't think his team could have
played any better than they did in the first half against Motherwell,
considering the week they had tackled, but admitted that the two missing
men, van Hooydonk and Thom, might have provided the goals.
O'Donnell has played in three Old Firm games, and experienced every
outcome, one loss, one draw and one win. His advice to the newcomers
would be to expect an incredible noise, a hectic pace and an almost
indescribable 90 minutes (or more).
''I thoroughly enjoyed them, even although we lost the first but it is
very hard to tell anyone else what it is like. This time it is at our
new stadium, it is a cup quarter final, and there are a lot of new
players.''

PAUL Gascoigne will play for Rangers from the start in his first Old
Firm game at the new Celtic Park tonight.
And no one at Ibrox yesterday was worrying over either his ability or
his temperament as they prepared for the Coca Cola Cup quarter-final.
Obviously, it was manager Walter Smith who declared that Gascoigne,
the supposed enfant terrible of the game, would be making his Old Firm
debut. And it was Smith, as well as a veteran of these matches, Ally
McCoist, who made little of the problems which might afflict a player on
such occasions.
Said Smith: ''Paul Gascoigne will play from the start of the game and
I have absolutely no worries about that. The only concerns any of us
have is the amount of newspaper attention which is devoted to this one
player.
''After three months of that kind of coverage, we would surely all
hope that he can be judged solely about what happens on the field. As
far as giving advice to players new to this game and its atmosphere, I
leave that to the lads who have experienced it all before.''
McCoist clearly is one who has tasted the unique atmosphere more than
most, and he had his own words on the Gascoigne adventure.
''He has gone through Rome derby games, all kinds of other big
matches, so what, really, can we tell him?
''All I would say is that there is no way at all we would want to curb
him. We don't want to put the reins on him because he was brought to
this club to express himself, and if we want to have the kind of
expression he can bring, then we let him show it.''
While Smith was happy to say that Gascoigne would begin the game, he
would go no further on his team selection. He did say that the 14
players on duty at Falkirk at the weekend, when Rangers won, would all
be listed and he added Stephen Wright and Brian Laudrup to his list.
He also made the point that he had no injury worries left after that
last game, and the only ones which did still concern him were those
long-term blows which Rangers have already suffered this season.
Smith did add: ''The first Old Firm game of the season is always
important -- though not always as decisive as the supporters of each
team might think. They look on it as being a guide to how their team
will do for the rest of the season, but it does not always work out that
way.
''This one is slightly different in any case because it is a one-off
cup game, and we both realise that. It will be interesting to get back
to Parkhead and see what the atmosphere is like but, then, there is
always an atmosphere about this game. No one can ever deny that.
''That is what makes the game what it is. I have seen seasoned
international players find this game hard to handle. It all depends on
how you approach it. We want to go into it in the right manner.''
His players seem to feel the same way. Goalkeeper Andy Goram, for
example, insisted yesterday: ''We have to go there looking for a win
but, then, that is always the way in these games. If you go to Parkhead
with a negative outlook, then you might come back with a negative
result. There is no way that we will look at this game in any other way
but a positive one.''
Goram is so positive about everything that he is already promising to
take any deciding penalty kick if that is called for.
''I have done it before,'' he remembers. ''I did it for Hibs against
Clydebank the first year I joined them. It went to a shoot-out and I
took the one which won the game. I'd be happy enough to do that again.
It would not worry me at all.''
Whether it goes that distance or not will be decided tonight. Whether
the new-look Parkhead will give Celtic an added edge will also go under
the Old Firm microscope.
Said McCoist: ''I hear it is very impressive, but I have to say that I
am happy to be back there. It was never quite the same playing Celtic on
league business at Hampden. There wasn't the same feeling about it.''
What the irrepressible Ibrox striker did not add was that Rangers'
record on their oldest rivals' ground is better than it has been at
Ibrox in recent years. That may have influenced his thinking.

NO-ONE loves housebuilders at present and there is little prospect of
any improvement in sentiment until the Budget in November. That may
reveal some goodies to encourage house purchase -- or it might not.
Certainly Midlands-based Bryant Group was bearish yesterday, with
chief executive Andrew MacKenzie saying that in the three months to
August reservations were 15% down on a year earlier.
However, one saving grace has been the Scottish operations which, in
their first full year, saw sales of 150 units at an average price of
#120,000. That compares with a group total 15% higher at 3735 units
sold, with the average price almost 13% greater at #107,000 as Bryant
moved further up market. The result is a UK average of around #110,000.
Scottish sales in the current year are expected to advance to about
180 units and sites are being developed at Milnagavie, Newton Mearns and
Paisley in the West, in addition to the two more mature Edinburgh
operations, one overlooking the Pentlands, the other in Morningside.
Chairman Colin Hope added that since December there had been a
significant loss of consumer confidence and there had been another
setback since June as fears over job security increased while potential
buyers held back for the Budget.
In the year to May pre-tax profits rose 25% to #45.8m, with overall
house margins actually showing a small improvement to 11.5%. The second
half was helped by the first downward renegotiations of building
materials prices. The dividend total has been marginally increased to
5.05p but the final has been only maintained -- at 3.6p -- in view of
the future uncertainty and the desire to keep a cover of two times.
The construction side saw its profits dip #3.1m to #2.5m, but there
were no exceptional settlements this year and it has a good order book.
There is some #12m still to come from the now terminated property
activities.
The shares fell 8p to 109p where they yield 5.8%.

COLIN Montgomerie had a message for Europe's Ryder Cup fans as
Concorde flew into Rochester, New York, yesterday: ''Don't worry about
Nick Faldo.'' The Englishman, who finished outside the top 20 in all
four majors this season, and a fortnight ago pulled out of the Lancome
Trophy in Paris with wrist trouble, has been in America for the past
week working on his game with coach David Leadbetter.
However, before he linked up with the rest of the side at Oak Hill
amid reports that his marriage is on the rocks, Faldo received a vote of
confidence from the man he is expected to partner again on Friday and
Saturday.
Montgomerie said: ''There are no worries about Nick Faldo as regards
the Ryder Cup. No worries. There's more pressure in the Cup than any
other tournament, even the majors, and Nick handles pressure better than
anybody I've ever seen.
''When Nick and I were put together at The Belfry two years ago, he
played terrific. He kept the whole team together. He was the most
experienced one of the whole lot. And that will be the same again this
time. He is an excellent partner and I'm happy for him to take control
of the partnership again.
''There'll be pressure on us because we'll be expected to win, but
that's okay. I'll play my stuff and him playing his normal game will be
fine by me.
''In foursomes play, I think we are as strong as anyone because we
play that type of game. In four-balls we're possibly not as strong, but
we can get it round.''
Montgomerie accepts that much is expected of him this week. He may
have lost the European No.1 spot when Sam Torrance lifted the British
Masters on Sundaty, but it is only a month ago that he lost a play-off
for the US PGA championship and he has won twice since then.
''This Ryder Cup is different for me,'' said the 32-year-old Scot,
about to collect his third cap.
''The first away and the first at home are daunting, but now I'm in a
position where I'm one of the players we're looking to get some points.
''Say I play five times, then I've got to be looking at three points
minimum for it to be a good Ryder Cup for me.
''I think that it's more of a situation this time where the Americans
know they're going to be in a tough match if they are drawn against me.
''They know that, because of my consistency, nobody should get an easy
game. I'm not going to throw anything away. I'll always be there.
''I'm a gritty competitor and I'm determined to do well, not just for
myself, but for the team. I look forward to it. It's a great
challenge.''
The Montgomerie-Faldo partnership -- they won two, halved one and lost
one last time -- is the only one that can be safely predicted.
Captain Bernard Gallacher has to decide who to put with Seve
Ballesteros now that Jose Maria Olazabal has withdrawn injured, but Ian
Woosnam's late call-up as replacement could see him reunited with
Bernhard Langer. They won twice as foursomes partners two years ago.

DUNDEE-based Second Alliance Trust believes sterling could plunge on
the foreign exchanges if the Conservatives try to boost their political
standing with swingeing tax cuts in November's Budget.
Second Alliance managing director Gavin Suggett, who also heads the
#1100m Alliance investment trust, the UK's third largest, believes there
may be some ''subtle'' tax cuts in the Budget but does not think the
Tories can give very much away. He said: ''I think we would be upset if
there were big giveaways.
''Nobody can escape the markets these days. If it looks like the
shackles are coming off, you will see the effect on the pound very
quickly.''
Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave has pledged that the
Government will not abandon its commitment to long-term fiscal
discipline for short-term political advantage.
The powerful performance of major world stock markets in recent months
enabled Second Alliance's 10.2% increase in net asset value to 1918p
during the year to end-July, a record year-end valuation.
Net asset value was down 4% at the halfway stage, pretty much in line
with the All-Share index. The #369m fund's buoyant full-year performance
was bang in line with that of the resurgent All-Share.
However, Second Alliance's North American holdings advanced only 13%,
significantly adrift of the 23% gain posted by the Standard &amp; Poor's
Composite Index. North America accounts for 24% of the fund.
Second Alliance's total dividend is 9.5% higher at 46p, after a final
payout of 32p.
Earnings per share rose 13.5% to 48.2p, although some of this increase
was the result of exceptional payouts from cash-rich UK companies, such
as major holding Great Universal Stores.
Although the underlying revenue trend remains positive, Second
Alliance said shareholders should not expect a repetition of last year's
13.5% growth rate in the current 12 months.
Second Alliance shares, which yesterday added 4p to 1818p, are trading
at a 5% discount to net asset value.

<HEADLINE>Stirling ready for their glamour match. Barbarians will present a stern test for County</HEADLINE>

THE Barbarians will be at the gates of Stirling next week, but for
once they will be welcome guests as champions Stirling County entertain
the glamourous invitation side for a rare and Royal encounter with a
Scottish club.
Retired Scotland captain Gavin Hastings will lead the Baa-Baas who
include five members of the Scotland World Cup squad. Craig Chalmers,
Bryan Redpath, Eric Peters, Iain Morrison, and Cameron Glasgow are the
Scots in the party named yesterday, although there is an immediate
injury doubt over Glasgow.
The side, which will provide a stern test for County, also includes
four Irishmen, three Welshmen, an Englishman, and the Canadian flanker,
Al Charron.
Glasgow, who damaged ankle ligaments while bowling in the cricket nets
at the end of the summer, has not played since the start of the season.
Yesterday, Heriot's coach John Foster said that 10 days ago, when
presumably the team was selected, Glasgow had been making good progress,
but the recovery had not gone as well as expected.
''I'd love to have him back in our side and I would be delighted if he
were to be playing for the Barbarians next week, but I can't see it,''
said Foster.
The game is being staged at Forthbank Stadium on Tuesday in the
presence of SRU Patron the Princess Royal, and as a taster for the main
event the Stirling County under-18 side will play Gordonstoun School,
which will be captained by the Princess Royal's son, Peter Phillips.
The normal Forthbank capacity of 4000 is to be boosted by an extra
2000 for the day by means of extra seating.
The match, which is being backed by the Barbarians' regular sponsor,
Scottish Amicable, represents only the third time -- seven-a-side
appearances excepted -- that the Baa-Baas have played a Scottish club
side, the only other occasions on which they have ventured north of the
Border on club business being for celebration games against Glasgow
Academicals and Melrose.
The sponsors are to extend what is termed the Amicable Gesture for the
day. Each Barbarians' try raises #300 for their opponent's national
youth coaching programme, and the home unions have already benefited to
the tune of #61,200. On Tuesday, the facility has been widened to
provide a similar amount for each try scored by County, the proceeds
going to the Bridgehaugh youth programme.
Barbarians' president, Mickey Steele-Bodger, said yesterday the club
had been delighted to accept the invitation, he added with a wry grin
and with reference to Kenny Logan's spasmodic appearances in the
tabloids, he assumed that County's international winger would be given
the day off because of all his ''night work.''
''Sorry Kenny,'' said Steele-Bodger to the listening Logan, ''news
travels fast and far.''
The president said that even with the game on the brink of
professionalism he saw no reason why the future of the Barbarians should
be placed in jeopardy. ''I don't think that anybody really knows where
the game is going, but I see no reason other than to be optimistic about
the future role of the Barbarians,'' he said.
Stirling County also announced their team for the show game, and
injured scrum half Kenny Harper reappears in place of Murray Fraser.
Coach Brian Edwards said it was the team which would take the field
against Boroughmuir on Saturday as the champions seek to set to rights
their record of three premiership defeats in four outings.
''The players have had one eye on this game since the start of the
season,'' he said. ''It's a big day not just for us but for the
development of rugby in this area. Maybe at the back of their minds the
players have been keen not to get injured before such a big show game.
''The problem for us has been getting the players' focus back to where
it was last season. Hopefully on Saturday and especially against the
Barbarians, we can use the occasion as a springboard to get us back up
there challenging for the title.''

* THE eight clubs in Premiership Divisions I and 2 meet at Murrayfield
tonight behind closed doors in an attempt to hammer out guidelines for a
professional game.
The fact that, on a show of hands, all 102 clubs in membership of the
Union voted on Friday night for a non-binding moratorium on payments to
players at all but national squad level, need not necessarily mean that
the country's top clubs will be of a similar mind.
Certainly, with the ambitious Watsonians club, for one, indicating
that they are at variance with the Union on the the recommendation that
Scotland be represented in next season's European championship by
districts and not clubs, it would, perhaps, be not too wide of the mark
to suggest that player-payment could be on the Myreside agenda.

PETER Walton, still recovering from a knee injury, has confirmed that
he has become the first Scottish player to sign for Newcastle Gosforth,
the English club that has been bought by millionaire businessman Sir
John Hall.
''I have been to see them and I have signed papers to be on the safe
side,'' said Walton. ''In England you get 120 days to make up your mind.
They have been in touch with me over the summer and I see no harm in
signing.''
Walton played for Gosforth before moving to Northampton but left the
club because of disagreements with the management, since replaced by
Hall. However, despite signing papers, Walton says he may play his rugby
in the Borders when he resumes playing, which should be at Christmas,
should the Newcastle deals fall through.
''I work beside Stuart Bennett, the Kelso wing, here in Wooler and I
would like to play for a Border club when I am fit,'' he said.

FORMER Scotland and British Lions captain Gavin Hastings has joined up
with the Scottish Claymores American Football team.
However, he has no plans to be involved in a playing capacity and the
relationship will be strictly business.
Careful not to rule out the possibility of playing totally, Hastings,
nevertheless, underlined it would be a ''long shot'' given his
commitments business-wise and to Watsonians.
His new company, Hastings International Ltd, has been contracted by
the Claymores as management consultants to help talks with the Scottish
Rugby Union. ''This doesn't mean I'll be playing for the Claymores,''
said Hastings. ''All the discussions I've had in the last few weeks and
months have been on marketing and sponsorship.
''It's not something I've thought about at this stage, nor will I be
doing so in the next few weeks. Maybe I'm not ruling it out as I could
say definitely no at this stage and then in a year's time, or whatever,
things could change. But it would be a long shot if it happened.''
On a business front, he added: ''The Scottish Claymores are an
exciting client for me. They are a professional and innovative
organisation and I am looking forward to working with them in a positive
way.''
The Claymores' new general manager, Mike Keller, said: ''Gavin has
tremendous talents that will enhance the marketing and sales of the
Scottish Claymores. He is a natural bridge for the positive evolution of
the Scottish Claymores as well as for the World League of American
Football.''

WHAT is the successful manager and entrepreneur in Scotland reading
these days? Whose business tips are helping him and her outperform their
colleagues on the way to the top of the executive pile?
Does such literary tic-tac really deliver the goods from the corporate
gods . . . or does entertainment value outstrip educational potential on
the best sellers list?
Stuart Paul, lecturer in Business Studies at Paisley University, will
turn the spotlight on the business book industry and discover what's
really worth reading.
Scotland's business elite will share with Herald readers the secrets
of their own bookshelves. We'll be looking at new releases, established
best-sellers, and maybe turning up a few surprises as well!
Today to launch the new series, Jim Warnock (left), group personnel
director with High Street retail giant John Menzies, takes a look at one
of the most influential books on the international market.
BUSINESS Process Reengineering appeared on the corporate agenda at the
start of the nineties and it has been Reengineering The Corporation*,
more than any other book, which has kept it there.
This year's publication of the paperback edition of what has become a
worldwide bestseller nudged me into re-assessing this well-written and
challenging book.
Michael Hammer and James Champy take issue with what they see as the
characteristics of many modern companies. They argue that most ''can
trace their work styles and organisational roots back to the
prototypical pin factory that Adam Smith described in The Wealth of
Nations''.
In the modern organisation, they contend that Smith's principle of the
division of labour and task specialisation results in work fragmentation
and complex management structures which, in turn, make co-ordination
difficult.
Too much company time and too many resources are today spent inside
the organisation and not enough dealing with external customers. The
result is inflexibility, unresponsiveness, the absence of customer focus
and a lack of innovation. ''Adam Smith's world and its way of doing
business are yesterday's paradigm.''
Hammer and Champy's prescription is reengineering -- ''the fundamental
rethinking and radical redesign of processes to achieve dramatic
improvement in critical contemporary measures of performance such as
cost, service or speed''. To meet ever increasing customer demand for
more customised goods and services requires a process focus.
When it comes to reengineering there are no sacred cows and no
processes that should stand in the way of satisfying the customer. In
one of the most famous sections in the book, the authors argue that it
is about ''beginning again with a clean sheet of paper: it is about
rejecting conventional wisdom and assumptions of the past''.
Reengineering is not changing what is, but creating what isn't. When
British Airways declared itself the world's favourite airline in the
eighties, it faced the challenge of becoming a different company, not
just a better one. It turned its thinking and processes on their heads;
staff were energised with a new vision, old ways scattered to the winds.
The same held true when Europcar decided to become the most
user-friendly and efficient rental car company in Europe and not an
omnipresent one. And when Haagen Dazs chose to make a visit to its
European ice-cream shops an exciting experience, the company did not
just change what it did or how work got done, it also had to adjust all
the well entrenched assumptions on which its previous decisions and
actions were based.
So what are the characteristics of reengineering? They include
multi-skilling jobs; giving individual employees more authority to take
decisions; replacing more traditional functional teams with process
teams, and managers taking on more of a coaching as opposed to a
supervisory role.
To reengineer successfully, you need to have in place employees who,
above all else, are flexible enough to grapple with new directions of
the business.
Why has reengineering attracted so much interest not only in America
but also in the UK? There are two main reasons: the inability of many
business processes to meet customer demands and satisfy needs, and
disappointment with the benefits stemming from the application of
large-scale IT systems in the eighties. It is not surprising
reengineering with its focus on processes as a powerful change mechanism
to align the operations of the business with customer demands, found a
ready audience.
A word of caution: senior management has frequently underestimated the
trauma -- internal conflict and soul searching -- that goes hand-in-hand
with the break from the present way of thinking and operating.
Unless managers orchestrate the creation of a new context, all the
work the organisation is doing to improve its competitiveness will at
worst yield unproductive effort and at best produce meaningful but
episodic change.
The attractiveness of this book is its conciseness, readability and
clarity. The case studies are well set out and relevant, though it is a
little short of ideas on how to tackle successfully the complexities of
culture change which come with reengineering. In my view it has not
dealt with the key issue of how to change well entrenched work
behaviour.
Nevertheless, it is a most interesting read. Companies cannot ignore
reengineering, lest they find themselves staring down the barrel of a
competitor's superior processes.

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi will miss the start of the new season on
Saturday as they set their sights on Europe.
Ragazzi, who face Norwegians Batsfjord in the European Cup next month,
will play in a 12-team tournament in Nuremburg this weekend. Their
scheduled league match with Falkirk will be played later this month.
''We are guaranteed three matches on Saturday and three on Sunday and
this will be ideal preparation for our European tie,'' explained coach
Tommy Dowens.
The competition will be made up by German and Ukrainian opposition as
Dowens hopes Ragazzi can this season become the first Scottish team to
successfully negotiate a hurdle in Europe.
At home, Ragazzi could get things all their own way if the evidence of
the pre-season Fingerprint tournament is reliable. They did not drop a
set in the event and yet were considerably understrength.
Kilmarnock were not present at the weekend but even Dowens is
concerned at what he sees as a lack of competition.

REGAL MASTERS SNOOKER:
TEENAGER Alan Burnett will be rubbing shoulders this week with
snooker's top men in the Regal Masters in Motherwell's Civic Centre, but
do not expect him to be over-awed.
Burnett will attempt to stay at the table as much as possible, knowing
that there is nothing to fear so long as his opponent -- whoever he may
be -- is confined to sitting in a chair.
The 17-year-old from Cumnock earned a wildcard place by virtue of his
5-2 victories over professionals Neal Foulds and Andy Hicks in Sunday's
four-man play-offs. Burnett is the world under-21 champion and his
all-round skills are accompanied by a good temperament.
The play-off exercise followed the withrawal of James Wattana, who was
scheduled to open against Peter Ebdon tomorrow afternoon. Instead,
Burnett will line up against the world No.10.
The #165,000 event begins this afternoon with world No.4 John Parrott
in action against Darren Morgan, with Steve Davis, still ranked world
No.2, awaiting the winner.
There will be even greater interest tonight for the all-Scottish
encounter between Alan McManus and John Higgins. ''I've hardly played at
all in the past couple of months,'' said Higgins, who at least has been
keeping his eye in by playing in local pro-ams. ''I don't know how Alan
is playing,'' added Higgins, who will be seeking revenge for a 10-3
defeat in the first round of the world championship earlier this year.
Whichever Scot emerges victorious will have a battle on his hands in
the quarter-final against Higgins' contemporary Ronnie O'Sullivan on
Thursday night.
Burnett and Ebdon will be playing for a place against Dubliner Ken
Doherty, who has won the event in the past two years. In fact the world
No.9 has yet to lose a match at Motherwell, although a 6-0 defeat by
Nigel Bond in a recent overseas event explains why he has been seen so
much at the practise table in the past few days.
A surprise finalist in the world championship, Bond opens tomorrow
night against Jimmy White. The greatest player never to have won the
world title, White has slipped to No.7 in the rankings and could drop
further unless he improves on last season's results.
Bond could spring a surprise but most people will be hoping that he
does not. On their minds will be the prospect of a quarter-final between
White and world champion Stephen Hendry on Friday night. If White is
flowing there is no more exciting sight at the snooker table.
But everything will depend on Hendry. He is possible the greatest
player of all time. But Hendry Hendry has a motive spurring him on
because victory would move him a step closer to his ultimate goal of
beating Steve Davis' record 70 big-time titles.
''I have decided that I have got five more seasons left and when I
quit professional snooker, I want to be known as the greatest player of
all time,'' said Hendry. ''One way to achieve that dream would be by
overtaking Davis in the all-time winners' list.''
Hendry has already achieved 55 major titles and has his eyes firmly
set on more before he bows out. ''If I can win the Embassy world title
again this season, then I would have equalled the modern-day record of
six world titles set by Davis and Ray Reardon. That would certainly be a
special landmark for me.''

DUNDEE United, upset at constant speculation surrounding their
Scottish international midfield player Billy McKinlay, are ready to make
their own moves into the transfer market.
McKinlay's latest link has been with Aberdeen who, I understand, have
spoken to the Tannadice club about the player without making any
official bid.
United are now ready to make counter-enquiries and, indeed bids for
either Duncan Shearer or Billy Dodds.
At Tannadice, no one will talk about the transfer moves, but there is
little doubt that United need to add to their fire power if they are to
catch Dunfermline in the first division promotion race.
New manager Billy Kirkwood has strengthened his team in various areas
but has been unable to find a consistent striker.
Both Shearer and Dodds, who has always interested United, could fill
that role. And, while Aberdeen lack a midfield man with the style and
steel of McKinlay, they have a surplus of front men.
United,of course, see McKinlay as being worth around #1.5m as a
current Scotland player. That may be beyond Aberdeen's reach but with
Shearer or Dodds to make up the fee a deal could be done. Up-for-sale
Pittodrie midfielder Paul Kane may also enter the equation.
United insist that they are not in the business of selling their
quality players after being relegated last season. The way that Kirkwood
has spent during the summer to bolster the first team squad on Tayside
has emphasised that.
But, he needs someone to get goals and Aberdeen want one of his major
assets and between the two, a deal could soon be done.
But Aberdeen will also assess Paul Bernard tonight before considering
a #1m bid for the Oldham player.
A Dons delegation will watch the Scotland midfielder in the Coca-Cola
Cup tie at Tranmere.
The Dons, meanwhile, have captain Stewart McKimmie, striker Scott
Booth and stopper John Inglis under treatment for tomorrow night's
Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final at Fir Park.
''They only did light work today, but should be all right for Fir
Park,'' said Aitken.

TRACEY Robb, the Scotland goalkeeper of Western Klick Photopoint who
has been playing well, has caught the Great Britain selectors' eye and
as a result has been called into contention for a place in Britain's
squad for the women's hockey Olympic qualifying tournament at Cape Town,
South Africa, in November.
Robb was called up to train with the squad this week at Lilleshall to
act as cover for Hilary Rose, who sustained a neck injury in the first
of Great Britain's three Tests with world champions Australia in Sydney
last month, matches in which the visitors did not fare too well.
With Rose's injury responding slowly to treatment, Robb has been
promised an early announcement on her position as reserve goalkeeper.
Five other Scots Pauline Robertson, Susan Fraser, Susan MacDonald,
Diane Renilson, and Rhona Simpson are all assured of their places in the
party for Cape Town.

POLITICIANS were warned yesterday that they must deliver a long-term
farm policy framework that would keep Britain's rural economy as a major
and sustainable wealth generator.
At a fringe meeting during the Liberal Democrat Conference in Glasgow,
John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, said
that a freer global market would occur in the years ahead but in
Scotland the rural and environmental role of hill farming was crucially
underpinned by hill compensatory payments.
''This sort of support is simply not negotiable if we expect to keep a
rural population in Scotland's less-favoured areas.'''
He pointed out that hill and lowground farming were interdependent and
that ''simplistic targeting of aid is not a sensible option for UK
agriculture''.
Ben Gill, deputy president of the NFU of England and Wales, said there
was a risk of ingorning the role and value of the agricultural industry
when the debate turned to landscapes and wildlife habitats.
''People in rural areas are in danger of becoming threatened
species,'' he said. ''In acknowledging the wider agenda we must not
forget the continuing importance of agriculture in providing good
quality food.
''Farming and its associated activities play a crucially important
economic and social role. Whatever the direction of agricultural policy,
a key role of farming and farmers will continue to be the creation and
management of a working countryside.''
Paul Tyler, MP for North Cornwall, said there was a growing problem of
leisure and access demands and that agricultural policies must ensure
farmers had a return on their efforts to meet these demands. He said
there should be no ''right to roam'' policy and farmers should be
recompensed for any increased costs in managing access land.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace MP suggested that in
Scotland the Government had underspent #10.5m on payments for
environmentally-sensitive areas and had overlooked the social objectives
that farmers play.
Mr Ross said the Common Agricultural Policy had coped with the
over-supply situation and added: ''There will continue to be
agricultural support in the foreseeable future. Farmers in remote areas
cannot survive on environmental support.''

JACK Walker, Blackburn Rovers' millionaire owner, will fly in from his
home in Jersey to link up with the Blackburn Rovers' management team at
Swindon tomorrow for the Coca-Cola Cup second round clash.
But the Premiership champions have dismissed suggestions that a
''crisis meeting'' had been planned amid mounting speculation that Kenny
Dalglish could be about to leave Ewood Park.
Blackburn have been blasted from all directions, with pundits and
rival managers among their fiercest critics after four defeats in six
League games. But assistant manager Tony Parkes yesterday retorted: ''We
have seen it and read it, but, if anything, it could have the reverse
effect -- it could just fuel our fire.
''We are only six games into the season and there is no great
depression on the training ground. We have to be big enough to take the
stick and strong enough to overcome it. It's a matter of us getting our
house in order as quickly as possible and the players are just as
determined.''
Meanwhile, Rovers midfield player Mark Atkins could be offered the
chance to join Wolves within the next few days. Atkins has been a
potential target for manager Graham Taylor for several months.
The former Scunthorpe defender, who cost Rovers just #45,000 seven
seasons ago, now commands a fee of around #1.5m.
* MORTON are to appeal to FIFA to help acquire clearance for Cameroon
keeper Andre Boe. The Greenock club's manager, Allan McGraw, said:
''Every day Andre comes in and asks if we have heard anything.
''He is training hard but without international clearance he cannot
play even in our reserves. What is even more worrying is that he cannot
earn his living. The SFA have done everything possible and I know they
have faxed and phoned the Cameroons asking for a clearance
certificate.''
Boe has asked for political asylum in Britain and his request is at
present in front of the authorities.
* TOMMY Svensson, who guided Sweden to third place in the 1994 World
Cup, has agreed to extend his contract as national coach until the end
of 1998.

MAI'S purchase of Anglia Television 18 months ago has proved well
timed in view of a downturn in its money broking business.
Profits from the latter tumbled 30% to #42.9m in the year to June, but
media profits, taking in a full year from Anglia, came to #43.7m. The
overall result was that the group pre-tax figure was 20% ahead at
#115.6m before exceptionals. Dividends are raised by 12% to 8.7p after a
final of 6.7p. MAI points out that dividends have increased by 12%
compound over the past five years.
Anglia performed strongly, helped by cost-cutting, with employee
numbers down a third to about 400, and integration of MAI's other
franchise, Meridian.
The acquisition brought in other interesting media investments such as
TSMS which handles airtime sales for Grampian, Scottish and other
television companies, and Village Roadshow, an Australian cinemas and
theme parks company which is expanding aggressively into the Asia
Pacific region.
The Anglia purchase was considered quite pricey at the time but cash
and other assets accounted for half the #290m purchase cost.
MAI bought Pearson's 15% stake in Yorkshire Tyne-Tees and the
investment is now worth more than it cost. MAI managing director Lord
Hollick reckons the company is still undervalued as it has the highest
operational gearing of all the television companies and has a very
valuable library. He would consider bidding for the whole company if the
restrictive ownership rules were relaxed, which is quite likely.
He is keen to expand MAI's media business and has some #200m available
for this. He is more interested in starting new ventures in-house or
with partners than in major acquisitions. He is keen on satellite
broadcasting and on expanding production interests for television and
new media such as CD-ROM, as well as providing on-line services through
the Internet.
Moneybroking was hit by lower volumes as a result of the 1994 bear
market in bonds but maintained its profits in the second half after
cost-cutting and expansion into Japanese fixed-interest markets.
The opinion research operation, which includes leading pollsters NOP
in the UK and MRI in the US, saw profits rise 20% to #13m, with customer
satisfaction surveys a growth area.
MAI chairman Sir James McKinnon said the current year had started
satisfactorily and that many new investment and profit opportunities
were opening up.
MAI shares gained 2p to 298p and are rated below purer media stocks on
account of the money-broking business, though they are gradually being
re-rated.

<HEADLINE>Playing the power game. ScottishPower raises Manweb bid to #1100m</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISHPOWER has raised its hostile bid for Manweb by a modest #60m
to #1100m, further weighting the scales that were already tipping in its
favour.
''We think this is a realistic price to win,'' said chief executive
Ian Robinson as ScottishPower bought a further 2.5 million Manweb shares
on the open market, taking its overall stake in the company to 17.25%.
Manweb predictably rejected the revised offer, describing it as
''mean'', but City analysts said it should be enough to clinch the deal.
''They are pitching it rather finely,'' said Andrew Wright, an
electricity analyst at Smith New Court in London, ''but I think it has
got a good chance of succeeding.''
The revised offer narrows a price gap that had opened up between
ScottishPower's main shares-plus-cash offer and its all-cash
alternative.
The Glasgow-based company added 10p to its main shares-plus-cash
offer, but increased the all-cash alternative by 75p.
For good measure, it also promised a 13.6% increase in the dividend
for the current financial year to 15.5p per share, providing the bid is
successful.
Bill McCall, at Tilney in Edinburgh, described the latest offer as ''a
goodwill gesture'' rather than a substantial improvement of terms.
But he was confident that Manweb was now in the bag. ''I think it's
about as far as they have to go,'' he said. ''The film is coming to an
end and you can virtually roll the credits on it.''
ScottishPower announced the improved offer, which it described as
final, after deciding that a fresh attempt to start talks with the
Manweb board at the weekend was getting nowhere.
Manweb said it was ''mean by comparison with most other recommended
offers in the sector'' and rejected it out of hand.
ScottishPower may only modify the terms of its latest offer if a rival
bidder emerges for the Chester-based company which distributes
electricity in Merseyside and North Wales.
But with six regional electricity companies still untouched by the
takeover frenzy in the privatised utilities sector, a contest for Manweb
is unlikely.
Manweb shareholders must, therefore, decide by October 6 whether to
accept the ScottishPower terms that are now on the table.
Beneath the argument over Manweb's real value lies a more fundamental
debate over the strategy necessary to make it a successful company in
the long term.
ScottishPower says the way ahead is to combine power generation with
electricity distribution and to diversify into new areas such as gas
supply and telecommunications.
Manweb, on the other hand, wants to concentrate on its core activity
of electricity distribution, shedding all other commercial interests.
ScottishPower says that approach offers limited potential for
long-term growth and the signs are that most investors agree.
Manweb shares came under heavy selling pressure yesterday and closed
down 3p at 1007p after nearly 6.5 million changed hands.
ScottishPower meanwhile fell 6p to 365p as investors factored the cost
of the revised bid and the dividend forecast into their earnings
expectations.
ScottishPower's is now offering #61.70 in cash, up from #60.70
previously, and 11 ScottishPower shares for every 10 Manweb shares.
In view of yesterday's fall in ScottishPower's own share price, this
revised offer is currently worth 1018[1/2]p per Manweb share -- only
3[1/2]p more than the ScottishPower's original offer was worth on
Friday.
But the all-cash alternative has been raised to 990p from 915p.
The result is a narrowing of the gap which had opened up between the
two offers since ScottishPower launched its bid for Manweb on July 24.
A steady rise in ScottishPower shares had increased the value of the
original shares-plus-cash offer by 9.3%, while the value of the
cash-only alternative remained static.
''They had to bring the cash offer into line. There was a gaping
differential that had almost reached 10%,'' said Mr McCall at Tilney.
ScottishPower said its improved offer for Manweb would not lead to any
increase in debt beyond the gearing level of 75% already forecast for
March 1996, assuming the takeover bid is successful.
ScottishPower finance director Ian Russell, described such a level of
gearing as ''reasonably prudent'' and said the debt level would be
progressively reduced after 1996..
ScottishPower had been expected to improve its offer this week
following the publication of a Manweb defence strategy on Friday which
promised shareholders a benefits package worth 550p per share.

POWERGEN confirmed yesterday that it is interested in securing its
future earnings by entering the electricity distribution market
alongside it existing generation activities.
It has secured a board recommendation from Midlands Electricity (MEB)
for its offer valuing the company at #1950m, inclusive of a special
dividend. The merged group will have a 15% share of the electricity
supply market and 20% of the power generation market.
The offer is 800p for each MEB share which, taken together with a
special dividend of 200p (net), values each share at 1000p. In addition,
certain shareholders will be entitled to reclaim the tax credit relating
to the special dividend, implying a gross value for them of 1050p a MEB
share. Shareholders will also be entitled to retain their right to the
final dividend of 20.45p (net) to be paid on October 2.
The 1000p-a-share offer represents a premium of 12% over the closing
price of shares on September 14, the last dealing day prior to the
announcement of a possible offer from PowerGen. MEB shares responded to
news of the agreed bid by jumping 33p to 971p, while PowerGen's rose
6[1/2]p to 585p.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of PowerGen, said the acquisition of MEB
''enables us to build here in the UK a dynamic, broadly-based energy
group positioned for the fully competitive domestic market post 1998''.
He added that the deal was in the best interests of shareholders, staff
and customers nationwide.
Bryan Townsend, chairman of MEB, said the board welcomed ''this
strategic and financial partnership which will create a strong
Midlands-based energy group with benefits and safeguards for both our
customers and staff''. MEB's domestic customers have seen their
electricity bills fall by 15% in real terms since 1991 with prices
frozen at their April 1994 level until March 1996.
If the offer goes ahead unconditionally, Mr Townsend will join the
board of PowerGen as a non-executive director, and Mike Hughes will join
the board of PowerGen with responsibility for distribution and supply.
In a busy day for the company, PowerGen also announced that it had
agreed to sell two of its power stations to Eastern Group, the
electricity company recently acquired by Hanson. Eastern is buying
2000MW of coal-fired plant, High Marnham and Drakelow C, for in excess
of #200m.
The disposal, at the behest of the industry regulator, Offer, is aimed
at opening up the power generation market to competition. It is expected
to reduce PowerGen's earnings per share by around 2% to 3% a year.

IT looks as if the biggest basketball event to come to the UK so far,
the McDonald's Open Championship, which was scheduled to take place at
the London Arena next month, will go ahead following the near 2-1 vote
by NBA players in favour of keeping their union.
Although there is still the fear that the dissident players, including
Michael Jordan, and their agents, who were in favour of decertification
of the union, might go to court to appeal against the verdict, the size
of the vote, nearly a 90% turn-out, and the margin 226-134, means that
most favour an end to the dispute.
The owners are expected to approve the deal and lift their lock-out
which threatened the start of the regular season on November 3 as well
as the pre-season showcase event, which will feature the NBA champions,
the Houston Rockets, alongside the champions of Australia, Europe,
England, Italy and Israel from October 19 to 21.
Had the lock-out continued and the season been delayed, then the
McDonald's event was certain to have been cancelled.
There is another, happier, problem for the organisers following last
weekend and that is that the London Arena's 8000 capacity is quite
clearly not enough to cater for the growing basketball demand in this
country.
Over 12,000 spectators, easily a British crowd record, attended last
Saturday's Budweiser league match between the home club Manchester
Giants and London side Leopards at the Nynex Centre in Manchester.
The arena there can hold 16,000 and is one of the biggest in Europe
and, in retrospect, the NBA must be wishing that they had taken the
event to Manchester for its first visit to Britain.

A SCEPTIC looking towards the Ryder Cup match at Oak Hill this week
observed: ''Outside the gallery ropes it's a circus, inside them it's a
zoo.'' Both judgements are true, but only because over the last 12 years
Europe's biennial encounter with the United States has been transformed
from the meaningless to the meaningful.
The happy coincidence of a forceful captain in Tony Jacklin and the
simultaneous evolution of the Big Five -- Severiano Ballesteros, Berhard
Langer, Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, and Ian Woosnam -- meant that after a
one point loss in 1983, victories followed in 1985 and 1987 and a tie
two years after that.
The appeal of the match has been by no means diminished by Europe's
narrow defeats in the last two confrontations.
If anything, those results have stimulated interest even further, to
the extent that in the Rochester area hotel rooms, private houses and
the best restaurant tables are fully reserved.
Such devotion to the cause by golf followers has its oppressive effect
on the players, pressurised as never before by both supporters and
media. The teams prowl the fairways like felines in cages -- as if
either development could be mutually exclusive given the match's revival
as a serious contest.
Even the European players' caddies yesterday flew out with their
employers on Concorde to the upper New York State city, hitherto better
known as the headquarters of Kodak, Xerox and Bausch &amp; Lomb -- all very
different from the arrangements experienced by this observer on his
first Ryder Cup venture to America.
In 1971, a chartered Boeing 707 of British Caledonian Airways left
Gatwick Airport in broad daylight, but in the then sporting equivalent
of under the cover of darkness, so indifferent to the enterprise was the
world at large. Players, officials, supporters and media were at one in
the acceptance of another inevitable loss.
A respectable five-point defeat at the Old Warson Club in St Louis was
the outcome yet, paradoxically, a thoroughly relaxed time was had by
all. Another eight years would go by before continental professionals
were admitted to share in the ritual slaughter before the balance of
power began to shift.
In the four matches over which Jacklin presided he succeeded, by the
example and precept of his own career, in giving Europe's players a
deservedly greater conceit of themselves. Nothing but the best in
travel, clothing, and equipment would do. No harm in that.
Unfortunately, triumphalism went to Jacklin's head. The defeat in
1991, agonisingly down to Langer's miss from six feet -- the last stroke
on the last green in the last game -- was just about acceptable to
Jacklin. Not so two years later, when he was seen actively to be
counting to regain the captaincy from Bernard Gallacher.
The distortion of the match's ethos, most evident at Kiawah Island in
Corey Pavin's Desert Storm camouflage cap and the stridency of the
American support, extended to Jacklin's criticism of what he perceived
to be Gallacher's deferential attitude to the demands of Ballesteros and
Langer not to play on the second afternoon.
Their absence was widely held, particularly by the metropolitan media,
to be responsible for a three-point advantage being reduced to one with
the singles to play.
Conveniently overlooked was the fact that, in three of these games,
Barry Lane was three up with five to play, Woosnam two up with six to
play, and Costantino Rocca one up with two to play -- and none of them
won.
Of course, the mere fact of the match having become more closely
contested, and even the trophy itself having changed hands, has
intensified the attention of the golfing world at large. It would surely
erase the burden of captaincy if Gallacher were given a fair wind, short
of a total disaster.
At any rate, now that Jacklin is out of harm's way, securely ensconced
in his third career as a member of the US Senior tour, perhaps Gallacher
will be allowed to get on with the captaincy unencumbered with
gratuitous comments that do not stand reasonable examination.
Maybe in the home town of the flambouyant Walter Hagen, one of the
prime instigators of the match and six-times captain of the United
States team, a further degree of the unexpected will, with luck, invest
the result -- of course, in Europe's favour. The three US Opens played
at Oak Hill might represent a portent.
In 1956, Cary Middlecoff won his second title, beating Ben Hogan and
Julius Boros into second place and outlasting Australia's Peter Thomson
who led by two strokes after 36 holes.
In 1968, Lee Trevino gained his baptismal professional victory as the
first player to score below 70 in all four rounds, and in 1989 Curtis
Strange became the first since Hogan in 1951 to retain the title.
In the aftermath of his victory, Trevino was asked what he would do
with his $30,000 first prize, less than ten times this year's
equivalent, by the way. He replied: ''I'll buy the Alamo and give it
back to the Mexicans.'' The sooner the Ryder Cup is given back to the
game the better -- no matter the result.

IN a few days time, something unique in sport will be seen, the waving
of a blue flag decorated with a yellow circle of stars, signifying
Europe as an entity, as a community, as a team.
If it happens at any major sporting occasion other than the Ryder Cup
then it has escaped my notice and, in any case, it will not be hoisted
with greater depth of feeling than at Rochester, New York, when the old
US of A jingoists wind up the visitors from the other continent.
It is one of the most bizarre developments of the last decade or so
that patriotism, always presumed to be a country-bound emotion, has been
broadened effortlessly under the continental golf umbrella.
The major reason for this, if we have to be truthful, is that the
Brits suddenly saw a chance of beating the Yanks after decades of
drubbings. There ain't nothing like the smell of victory to warm the
patriotic breast and endear the flag, any flag, to the beholder.
At any rate, the wee blue flag with the starry circle has become
necessary luggage for Ryder Cup supporters from this country. It is the
case, too, that we willingly let Swedes, Italians et al have a shot if
they feel so inclined.
It may not be as wholeheartedly European as Edward Heath longed for
all those years ago, but it might be as good as he is ever going to get,
in any circumstances.
What has truly enlivened a hitherto rather unexciting competition is
the uncertainty of its outcome. Not for a dozen years has the match been
easy to predict and that has given it the stimulus that any serious
competition requires.
This remains the case this year, although there is a strong body of
opinion that says the US is in a stronger position than for some time.
Be that as it may, the fact is Europe badly needs to bring the old
trophy back this weekend.
There are a number of reasons for saying so, not least because the
home side has not had the Ryder Cup on display for four years. Victory
has eluded our lot in the nineties after the glorious revolution of the
eighties.
It is that statistic which has ominous undertones if we are to
maintain the prestige of the European Tour which reached top of the
world status in the previous decade.
Those were the days when Faldo, Ballesteros, Woosnam, Langer and Lyle
were among the best players in the world and, indeed, dominated the
major scene in a way Europeans had never done before.
When you add Seve's protege, Olazabal, the ever eager Sam Torrance and
the brilliant Colin Montgomerie, you can see why this was one
magnificent era for the continental tour.
Looking at them on the eve of the 1995 battle, you may find it
dificult to generate the same tingle of confidence.
Nick Faldo has been a long way short of the man who was unquestionably
the world's No.1 a couple of years ago. Even his switch to America to
play in consistently good conditions has not yet produced the standard
that was his hallmark. Putting seems to be letting him down more often
than in the good old days.
Seve, the great Seve, is only a shadow of the wonderful cavalier who
intimidated the Americans by dint of his immense will-to-win and self
confidence. He can still play a bit, but the certainty that he would
beat anybody they cared to stand on the first tee with him is no longer
there.
Ian Woosnam has been going through putting fluctuations like a man who
no longer knows what it is like to stand up and pop the ball in the
hole; Sandy Lyle is not even in the team and Berhard Langer, who is
suffering from a back injury, has lost his early season sparkle.
Olazabal had to withdraw injured.
Torrance has a poor record in the competition, but is in the best form
of his life, while the best and most consistent player in the squad is
Montgomerie.
The others -- Mark James, Costantino Rocca, David Gilford, Howard
Clark, Philip Walton and Per-Ulrik Johansson -- will win some, lose
some, but none of them is likely to be the inspirational leader that
Ballesteros or Faldo could be. That is why a resurgence of the Faldo
magnificence or the Ballesteros brilliance seems a pre-requisite of
European success.
What is for sure is that Europe badly needs this victory. The Tour has
been less than riveting for the past couple of years, the forays into
the great majors have not brought any success at all this year. In fact
Americans Corey Pavin (US Open), Ben Crenshaw (US Masters) and John Daly
(The Open) have won three of the four, with a regular on the US Tour,
Steve Elkington of Australia, taking the fourth, the US PGA title.
The US team does not even make room for Daly and, while it is not
packed with awesome superstars of the Nicklaus-Watson-Palmer school,
they are better than average and hungry to prove themselves better than
Europe.
Now you know why we need to wave those wee blue flags.

MIDDLESEX duly sealed second place as the 1995 Britannic Assurance
County Championship programme reached a soggy conclusion yesterday.
Mike Gatting's side could only manage a draw with Somerset at Taunton,
where rain prevented an interesting finish. But they were already
guaranteed runners-up spot to Warwickshire because no play was possible
at Hove, where Northamptonshire, who must make do with third place, had
needed a win over Sussex.
Middlesex, chasing 350, were on 262 for six -- Paul Weekes made 79 and
Mark Ramprakash 73 -- when the match was brought to an early end.
Veteran off-spinner John Emburey, who is considering a string of
coaching offers for next season, was at the wicket for the final ball in
what could prove his last championship appearance for Middlesex.
Jeremy Hallett had earlier capitalised as the home side were fed quick
runs, reaching an undefeated 111 after resuming on 22.
The day's only other century maker was Paul Prichard, who took his
overnight 27 to 104 as Essex beat Yorkshire by 89 runs at Chelmsford to
clinch fifth spot.
Essex had started the day looking likely losers -- just 92 runs ahead
with five second-innings wickets left -- but were boosted by Prichard
and Robert Rollins, who added 77.
Peter Such then took five for 89 as Yorkshire, needing 275 to deny
their hosts a fifth successive championship win, were sent back for 185.
Lancashire finished a place above Middlesex, but their season finished
on a sour note with a final day collapse at Derby, where the home side
romped to a 282-run victory.
Skipper Mike Watkinson saw his side slump from 19 without loss to 155
all out in 100 minutes and admitted: ''That was a last day of the season
performance. There are no excuses -- it was terrible.''
Derbyshire's victory represented a fitting end to 13 seasons of
captaincy by Kim Barnett.
Surrey's disappointing season came to a frustrating end when rain
deprived them of a win over Hampshire.
Having declared overnight, 114 behind, Surrey bowled well to dismiss
Hampshire for 152 and create a target of 267.
They reached 175 for two with the help of an unbeaten 77 from Nadeem
Shahid and 75 from Darren Bicknell.

NIKE profits soared in the latest quarter as worldwide orders for its
athletic footwear and apparel jumped to record levels.
Nike stock jumped $7.215 to $99.625 on the New York Stock Exchange
after the company reported the earnings, which were well above analysts'
highest expectations.
The company also announced a two-for-one stock split, which was
approved by shareholders at the annual meeting held at Nike's corporate
campus in suburban Portland.
''It's clear that we had a fantastic quarter and a fantastic last 12
months,'' Nike Chairman Philip Knight said in a conference call with
analysts and reporters.
Nike said its profits rose 55% to a record $164.8m, or $2.26 per
share, in its fiscal first quarter ended August 31, from $106m, or $1.43
per share, in last year's first quarter. Sales rose to $1610m from
$1170m.
Industry analysts said that even more impressive was Nike's report
that orders for its athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery
between September and January rose 32% to a record $2300m.

SOUTH African officials said yesterday they may try to hold on to
All-Africa Games medals which they should forfeit because they were
achieved thanks to the efforts of a woman who tested positive for a
banned stimulant.
Karen Botha, wife of former Spingbok rugby captain Naas Botha, won
long jump bronze and ran in the heats of the sprint relay in Harare. The
South Africans took silver without Botha in the final before she was
found to have taken pain-killers containing dextropropoxyphene.
Under international rules her relay involvement disqualifies the whole
team. Despite this, officials say they may appeal against the ruling.
Maria Mutola, winner of the International Amateur Athletic Federation
overall grand prix title, was embraced by Mozambique president Joachim
Chissano after her 800m win in 2-01.06, while Nigerian Mary Onyali,
hinting at a doping witch-hunt against her compatriots, took the women's
200m in 22-75.
Nicholas Nyongera (Zimbabwe) won the men's marathon in 2-20-08, while
South African Jowaine Parrott won the women's marathon in 2-55-09.
Another South African, Okkert Brits, took the pole vault with 5.50m.
On the last day of the athletics programme, cross-country
internationalist Ruth Cheruiyot won the women's 5000m in 15-37.73, while
another Kenyan, Josephat Machuka, disqualified for hitting a rival at
the world junior event, came good by completing the 10,000/5000m double.
But his country could manage only eight golds, behind Nigeria, with 13.
However Mutola's world 1000m record (2-29.34) set in Brussels, is one
of three which the IAAF yesterday said they have yet to ratify. Fernanda
Ribiero's 5000m mark (14-36.4) and six pole vault bests in excess of
4.15m also await approval. The best of the latter is 4.22m by Daniela
Bartova.
Nine men's world records were set in 1995, plus five indoors, and one
junior best. Women established 21 world bests (14 and 3 in new events
the pole vault and hammer respectively), plus eight indoors, and one
junior.
* THE Scottish Athletics Indoor League for young athletes will again
be staged this winter in the Kelvin Hall. West division matches begin at
10am, and East matches at 2pm, on December 10, January 7, and February
25. The final is on March 3. All interested clubs are invited to a
meeting at the Kelvin Hall on September 30 at 2pm.

BRITAIN'S growing army of old age pensioners is to be mobilised to
help save the doorstep pinta delivery service.
Aid is also being sought from Brussels to ensure the survival of the
environmentally friendly recyclable glass milk bottle.
Unveiling this two-pronged approach in London yesterday, Dr Gavin
Strang, Shadow Agriculture Minister, said that European farm policy
spending on the dairy regime amounted to #3000m a year, much of which
was not well spent.
''But there is actually a subsidy in that regime for milk in schools
and we think that is a useful model. We want to see the CAP support the
doorstep delivery service, and the way we suggest they do it is to
subsidise the bottle.
''There is a tremendous drive in Europe on this packaging directive to
avoid waste and use recyclable materials. The milk bottle is ideal from
that point of view as it is used time and time again.''
He was supported by Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, the
farm co-operative which controls the majority of the liquid milk market.
He said the European farm regime was becoming more environmentally
orientated so it was not unreasonable this drive should be extended to
other aspects of life.
David Moxon, chief executive of the National Dairymen's Association,
said there was a key social need for doorstep deliveries -- which
account for just under half of all liquid milk sales across Great
Britain, although much less in Scotland -- to remain, particularly for
the old, the isolated and the disabled.
Leaders of the 1.5-million strong National Pensioners' Convention,
Jack Jones and Margaret Wytham, also pledged their full support to the
House of Commons' petition which was launched yesterday. Mr Jones said
that contact with the outside world for many was only maintained by the
milkman or the postman.
Dairymen and pensioners and others are being asked to collect
signatures for the petitions which will be handed to local MPs with a
request to bring the campaign to the attention of the Commons and to put
pressure on the Government to act. Dr Strang stressed it was a non-party
campaign.
Doorstep sales have dwindled in recent years largely due to
cost-cutting by supermarkets which sell at an average 28p per pint as
opposed to 40p for delivered milk. Mr Moxon said there were other
factors, such as time of delivery and range of goods offered, but these
were being addressed by deliverymen.

RALLYING
COLIN McRae, driving an Impreza for the 555 Subaru World Rally Team,
has leapt from fourth to second in the world championship after having
finished runner-up in Rally Australia, which finished in Perth, Western
Australia, yesterday.
With two of the eight rounds remaining, the 27-year-old from Lanark is
now one of four drivers with a realistic chance of winning the
championship.
His rivals are the current leader and four-times world champion Juha
Kankkunen, from Finland, the reining champion, Frenchman Didier Auriol,
and McRae's Subaru team-mate, Carlos Sainz, from Spain.
Rally Australia was won by Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson driving a
Mitsubishi Lancer, who beat McRae by 19 seconds after 500 kilometres of
competitive driving over gravel roads.
These two were joint leaders starting the fourth and final day when
Eriksson produced an uncatchable performance and moved into the lead.
McRae, navigated by Glasgow's Derek Ringer, responded with a
counter-attack but a spin in the 30th and final special stage put paid
to his bid for victory.
David Richards, head of the 555 Subaru world rally team, said: ''It
was a fantastic drive by Colin. It's disappointing he didn't finish
ahead of Kenneth, but he couldn't have driven any harder and I'm
delighted.'' Results (British unless stated):
1, K Eriksson/S Parmander (Sweden) (Mitsubishi Lancer) 4-53-59; 2, C
McRae/D Ringer Subara Impreza 4-54-18; 3, J Kankkunen (Finland)/ N Grist
(Toyota Celica) 4-55-54; 4, T Makinen/S Harjanne (Finland) (Mitsubishi
Lancer) 4-57-26; 5, A Schwarz/K Wicha (Denmark) (Toyota Celica) 4-58-10;
6, B Thiry/S Prevot (Belgium) (Ford Escort Cosworth) 5-10-51.
FAI World Rally Championship -- positions after six of eight rounds --
1, Kankkunen 62 pts; 2, McRae 55; 3, D Auriol (France) 51; 4, C Sainz
(Spain) 50; 5, Eriksson 58.

WALTER Swinburn has been booked to partner Oaks winner Balanchine,
while the other Godolphin runner, Derby winner Lammtarra, will have
champion jockey Frankie Dettori aboard in next month's Prix de l'Arc de
Triomphe at Longchamp.
The decision was announced by the syndicate's racing manager, Simon
Crisford, and caused an immediate reaction from one of the country's
leading bookmakers who tightened the odds of the Lammtarra to 4-1
favourite from 9-2 joint with his stablemate.
Balanchine, second behind Carnegie in last week's Prix Foy, is now a
5-1 chance for Europe's premier autumn event.
* MEDAILLE Militaire, 10-1 second favourite for the Cambridgeshire, is
set to run at Ascot instead. The colt has been declared for the
12-furlong Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes, the opening event of the
two-day Festival of British Racing, on Saturday.
Trainer John Dunlop had issued a warning last week about the colt's
participation at Newmarket, and the Ascot entry confirms that the son of
Highest Honour will be aimed at races in excess of 10 furlogs.
Although he won one of the hottest mile handicaps of the year, the
Britannia at Royal Ascot, Michael Kinane reported that Medaille
Militaire would be suited by longer trips after having taken an extended
mile and a quarter race at York in August.

EMERGING Market can earn further Epsom success this afternoon for dual
Derby-winning trainer John Dunlop.
He has shown useful form since stepping up to seven furlongs this
season and looks to have first-rate claims in the Ron Smyth Stakes.
Ocean Park is worth chancing against some exposed rivals in the
closing Ladbroke Handicap.
The four-year-old's comfortable win at Southwell in June on his first
start for Lady Herries marked him out as a gelding with improvement in
him and he goes well enough fresh.
Petit Point can underline trainer Richard Hannon's fine recent form by
taking the Dynasty maiden at Nottingham.
Trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam should land the opening race with Ailesbury
Hill, who takes a drop in class after having contested the May Hill
Stakes at Doncaster last time out.

''UP THE stakes,'' is often the cry upon learning that an opponent is
taking lessons. There might be a sneaking admiration at the effort being
made to improve, but we all know that to get better, you have first to
get worse and that knowledge is usually worth a pound or two.
Those who consider a visit to the club pro in the same category as an
appointment with the dentist, might be interested, however, in the
findings of the latest PGA Game Improvement Report.
The pain factor among the great untaught is not as pronounced as you
might think. Of those not currently taking lessons, only 13% said it was
because it upsets their game. The highest category, 26%, simply weren't
interested, 24% said they didn't have enough time -- presumably an
acknowledgment that to gain the full benefit from instruction, you must
practise as well -- while 19% felt they were too expensive.
At an average of #12.37 a lesson this last group might be regarded as
niggardly, but even here there is a surprise. The cost factor is a
significant drawback only for the socio-economic groups C2 and DE, yet
those least able to afford lessons are the ones who take the most.
For example, 37% of men in group DE have taken a lesson in the last
six months, compared with 17% in group AB, where the time factor was
more important.
Our golf tip feature, it seems, has some way to go. Only 2% regard
newspapers as the place to go for help, but to be fair we have regularly
pointed out that while tips are fine, they are no substitute for the
real thing.
The figures in general make gloomy reading for pros. Only 26% of
golfers in Britain and Ireland had taken at least one lesson in the last
six months, but the good news is that it is still a rise on last year.
The breakdown of this figure is 23% for men, who are more likely to rely
on advice from unqualified friends, and 43% for women. No attempt is
made to explain why women should be more interested in instructuion, and
suggestions are welcome.
There is also a sign of philanthropy among club pros in that a larger
overall figure, 40%, regard their main source of help to be their club
pro. In other words quite a large number ask for advice and receive it
without paying a penny.
Yet there is evidence that club golfers would benefit from a more
enlightened approach in that the lower the handicap, the more likely a
player is to take a lesson. Of those with handicaps of four or better,
73% had been under recent instruction, and this figure falls to 8% for
the group with no handicap, a case perhaps for insisting that new
members take a minimum number of lessons before they can set foot on the
course like they do on the Continent.
There are some points not covered in the survey which might be
important. If practice facilities which, generally are inadequate or
non-existent but the newer course, were better, there is a good chance
more would take lessons. A cramped area is a discouragement, especially
when much of the time is going to be spent sorting out your balls from
those of the other people sharing it with you.
Equally, if a player has taken a series of lessons, and at a later
date needs an adjustment, there is always the likelihood that the pro
who has earned the player's faith has moved on to a different club. How
many of us who took lessons in our formative years no longer have access
to our trusted guru of yore?
Still, club pros can take assurance from the report finding that only
2% of those who don't take lessons simply don't like the pro. If you
consider the converse, a 98% popularity vote for the PGA Party is high
by any standard. What would the Tories give for that result in a poll?

GOLF TIP
This week's tip comes from MAURICE MOIR, professional at Hamilton Golf
Club.
''KEEP the head still'' is probably the most common piece of advice
given to all standard of golfers. But my advice is don't anchor the head
-- there has to be a slight movement to allow for a proper turn on the
backswing.
If the head is stuck, the weight stays too much on the left side and
the swing will be very flat. The player will be unable to get back to
the ball properly, and will also fail to swing right through the shot.
As a result, the ball is likely to be pushed or sliced to the right.
Players tend to think that they have to fix the head to avoid swaying
on the backswing. But, again, this is not the case. Obviously, there
shouldn't be a huge movement of the head, but there has to be some
slight give.
Desperate attempts to keep the head still is a fault that afflicts all
golfers, from the beginner to the low handicapper. But it really is the
wrong piece of advice.

THE award-winning team of director Francesca Zambello and designer
Alison Chitty has scored another exhilarating success with its treatment
of Arianna, the lost opera by Monteverdi re-composed by Alexander Goehr.
Visually refreshing, emotionally taut, flawlessly staged, this world
premiere sweeps aside contemporary challengers.
With no intervals in two hours, it tells the tale of Ariadne, princess
of Crete, her betrayal by Theseus, vanquisher of the Minotaur, and her
subsequent seduction by Bacchus. Susan Graham is a noble Arianna,
poignant in her grief. She heads a uniformly strong cast, with notably a
moving, powerful performance by baritone Gidon Saks as the fisherman
messenger.
Some of the staging flirts with silliness, but manages to pull back in
time: the host of boy cherubim descending from the heavens on bright red
wicker chairs, is fun; the fishermen depositing their silver catch in
their shimmering net, beautiful; Arianna entangled in the fishermen's
lines as she struggles against their efforts to save her, captivating.
If the colouring is a suspiciously '90s Conran aqua and blue, the design
with its visual tricks and refeshing simplicity -- no sets, just props
and Alan Burrett's excellent lighting -- gives uninterrupted pleasure.
There are no foot tapping melodies in Goehr's resurrection, just a
beautifully judged construction of emotional layers, building to
Arianna's devastating lament. Ivor Bolton, principal conductor of the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra, leads a small period ensemble set in
informal 17th century fashion in a shallow pit in the middle of the
stage. It is a new, yet delightfully familiar Arianna.

JAZZ and sex have always mingled well: a lone saxophone and a torrid
cinema love-affair. You just don't expect a big bloke in a stripey
yellow suit, snap-brim fedora and taste in workingmen's club humour to
burst into the bedroom.
But like a Viz cartoon character -- George Melly, the man on the telly
-- raised the steamy stakes. Previously we had funked along nicely as
Humphrey Lyttelton had schmoozed his band through Strange Mr Peter
Charles. Described as Hitchcockian, it was more a tramp through the
nightclubs of Starsky and Hutch. An aural realm where our pair would
chase dope dealers in seventies thrillers. Smokin'!
Then Mr Melly cracked the audiences mouths open with saucy jokes
before stretching them into wide smiles with his renditions of
Underneath The Arches and I Want My Fannie Brown. There is some-thing
decadent about an elderly man who should know better choosing not to.
It should have been announced during the interval that Battle Of The
Drums was to follow. Supping time was lost. Everyone hates drum solos.
Though under-attended, the evening was rounded off by Kenny Ball who
ensured everyone had their turn in the spotlight, even directing the
lighting himself. The genial atmosphere and laid-back tunes created by
previous acts was shaken up by his gleefully wicked approach.

Sara Villiers prefers the palapable genius of new company Theatre
Babel to the tortured mimicry of movie culture, Tarantino-style
DAMN the hide of Tarantino. The geeky smartie might have given
Hollywood a much-needed kick up the pants with his clever-dick catering
to the po-mo gerbil's-attention-span generation -- but his influence on
culture, popular or otherwise, has become so over-hyped and overstated
as to be pernicious.
It's a case of gimmick overkill; suddenly everthing's Reservoir
Kittens or Reservoir Bitches and nothing, from club nights to soundtrack
albums, is deemed hip unless it's been well and truly Pulp-ed.
The most irritating example of this trend is the phenomenon known as
Pulp Shakespeare, with the marketing bods assuming that the Tarantino
association gives the Bard a dose of street cred. Ugh.
It's so preposterous, considering William Shakespeare perfected a
thrilling blend of bawdy buddy-humour and high-octane violence, spilling
guts and blood across the stage with dispassionate regularity long
before Quentin's grand-daddy was a twinkle in his
great-great-great-great-grandparents' eyes. Perched on a celestial cloud
or burning lump of sulphur, Shakespeare probably greeted the Pulp
Fiction furore with a yawning ''Huh, been there, seen it, done it all
before''.
Even more exasperating is the fact that the term Pulp Shakespeare is
so often a lazy description for incoherent productions characterised by
dance music and quasi-Gaultier costumes. Having sat through the
excruciating dramatisation of Venus and Adonis by the Actors' Touring
Company and the Hairy Marys earlier this year, I determined that the
next time I received a press missive promising a Pulp Shakespeare
production I would slice the ears off the perpetrator.
So the mention of a Tarantino movie in a press release from Theatre
Babel, Scotland's only small-scale touring company specialising in
repertoire performances of classical theatre, quickly set my
blood-a-boiling.
But Graham McLaren, co-founder of the company with Rebecca Rodgers,
denies they are leaping aboard the Pulp bandwagon, pointing out that
they merely claimed they were for ''people who would rather go and see
Pulp Fiction than pay to see another ill-conceived Shakespeare
production.''
Splitting hairs perhaps, but he insists that they are just as appalled
by trendy productions. Set up last year by McLaren and Rodgers, both
graduates from the RSAMD, Theatre Babel's intention is to produce
dynamic productions of classical works with an emphasis on a clarity and
precision which does not sacrifice the text to style over substance.
Last year they debuted with repertoire productions of Twelfth Night
and Romeo and Juliet and they are now touring with a repertoire bill of
Hamlet and another production of the star-crossed lovers. McLaren might
feistily declare an abhorrence for theatres ''preoccupied with putting
bums on seats'' but it seems likely that Romeo and Juliet's status as a
fixture on the school syllabus makes it a pragmatic choice.
McLaren's opinions on the state of Scottish theatre are refreshingly
spunky -- I enjoyed our verbal spat about the role of critics -- if a
tad conceited.
His view that while companies like Red Shift and Cheek-by-Jowl had
revitalised Shakespeare in England, no company in Scotland had dared to
do the same, ignores the celebrated history of controversial
interpretations by the Citizens' Theatre.
When pressed, he acknowledges this then makes cryptic comments about
the decision of ''another Scottish company'' -- it is the Royal Lyceum
-- to stage Hamlet after Theatre Babel had announced they would perform
the play, which has not been staged in Scotland for some years.
Such ferocious loyalty to Theatre Babel demonstrates the commitment
necessary to get a company off the ground and McLaren is certainly
impressively organised, managing to sell out last week's visit to the
Belfast Arts Centre weeks in advance.
Maggie Kinloch, former artistic director of the Byre Theatre who is
currently teaching at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, is
directing Romeo and Juliet, and speaks of her tremendous relief to be
unburdened by McLaren of financial and administrative concerns to
concentrate on directing.
''I think what Babel are trying to do is similar to what Ian Brown was
doing with TAG in the mid-eighties, to give classic productions an
energy and accessibility that speaks to a younger audience. Until now I
don't think anyone else has followed that through,'' she says.
''We've been working in a collaborative way, discussing the text in
depth, exploring personal relevance, and I really believe this young
company are breaking new ground, working in a way I am convinced is the
right way.''
Peter McAllister, current Head of Acting at the Samuel Beckett Centre
in Dublin having previously taught at the RSAMD, who is directing
Hamlet, agrees. ''They're more concerned with process rather than
product which leads to interesting and original work. Many young
companies are too intimidated to tackle Hamlet although it says a lot to
a young generation about the responsibilities inherited from
forefathers, and many young actors are too frightened by the leading
role. It can seem like a mountain but the challenge is in trying to make
that climb.''
It is a climb which McLaren is undertaking; originally he had his eye
on Laertes but took on Hamlet after other actors approached expressed
trepidation. Unintimidated by perceived benchmark performances he is
attacking the part with gusto. ''It's a role which is both brilliant and
terrifying but you can't be afraid of not giving the definitive
performance,'' he says.
McAllister is confident that their production is a vital, streamlined
one, which speaks directly to a supposedly disaffected youth about the
business of doing the right thing. ''We're addressing a generation which
finds words difficult. In Shakespeare's time school children learned 230
different rhetorical figures but we can only mention metaphors and
similes. Modern audiences do have trouble with language and we have to
be as clear as possible. I think we've succeeded, but it's not Pulp
Shakespeare, it's palpable Shakespeare.''

A UPTURN in Far Eastern stock markets towards the end of its financial
year allowed Murray Johnstone's Scottish Asian Investment Company to
recoup virtually all of its earlier losses.
Management of the #57m trust is being moved to Murray Johnstone's
recently-opened Singapore office and Scottish Asian's investment
director, Peter Montgomery, has moved there from Glasgow.
The Glasgow-based investment management group's new
Singapore-incorporated subsidiary, Murray Johnstone (Asia) Pte, will
manage not only Scottish Asian but also some other existing client funds
in the Asia-Pacific region.
In all, Murray Johnstone manages about #480m in the region and it
believes its presence in Singapore will enable it to attract more funds
from the US and Middle East.
Peter Linthwaite has moved to Singapore from Murray Johnstone's London
office, where he ran the private equity operations for five years, to
take up responsibility for developing business in the Asia-Pacific as
managing director of the new subsidiary.
Scottish Asian's fully-diluted net asset value was off only 1.2% over
the year to end-July, at 292p, having been down 16.2% at the halfway
stage. Its performance was only marginally worse than that of its
benchmark MSCI Combined Far East Free ex-Japan index, which lost 1%
during the 12 months.
During the year to end-July, Scottish Asian's shares rose from 263p to
299p but they have since slipped back to be at a marginal discount to
net asset value.
Yesterday, the shares lost 2p to 289p, with net asset value little
changed from July 31.
During the year, exposure to Singapore was increased from 13% to
21.5%. Scottish Asian has invested heavily in property related stocks,
believing they will benefit from the country's low interest rates and
continuing move to owner-occupation.
Exposure to Hong Kong, which had been reduced from 25.5% to about 15%
by the halfway point, had been increased to 30.1% by the year-end.
The trust's other major market is Malaysia, which accounted for 27.4%
of shareholders' funds at July 31.
Scottish Asian was top of its eight-strong peer group in terms of
share price total return and net asset value total return for the five
years to end-July. Over 12 months, it was fourth in terms of net asset
value total return, out of a larger peer group of 10.

IS being a jeweller a gem of a job? Does the working day have sparkle?
Fraser Buchanan might say the answer to both question is yes. He is
lucky, mind you, in that he now owns his own business, designing and
manufacturing high-quality jewellery to order.
He is happy at his Glasgow jewellery design studio but acknowledges
that not everyone would be suited to such tasks. ''You have to have
confidence in yourself,'' he says. ''A sapphire worth many thousands of
pounds could shatter. You have to know what you are doing, and not be
afraid to do it.''
Buchanan, who left Woodfarm High School, Thornliebank in 1981 with
five Highers before studying electrical and electronic engineering at
Strathclyde University, had no notion of being a jeweller.
As his course proceeded, however, he came to realise that electronic
design might not offer him the independence and freedom of expression he
needed. He had also been doing a Saturday job in a big Paisley
jeweller's shop throughout his course, and this taught him a lot about
the trade.
He felt he had a natural flair for jewellery design and manufacture
and that there was a niche for him in the business.
By the time he graduated with a BSc Hons in 1985 he had made up his
mind. He took a full-time job with the Paisley firm and spent seven
years there, polishing his skills and knowledge, handling gold, silver
and precious stones with confidence, and establishing a working pattern
where he discussed repairs and design jobs personally with the customer
rather than leaving it to the salesman.
The firm went out of business in 1992 and he took two years out to
think things out, sailing around Skye and the West Coast and reflecting
that the stock, materials and equipment he had amassed over the years
would be not a bad launching pad for a business of his own.
His design studio was launched just over a year ago in Glasgow's South
Side where he is now building up a faithful clientele through
word-of-mouth recommendation -- ''the best way'', he says.
In addition to the usual rubies, emeralds, diamonds and sapphires he
likes to introduce less well-known precious stones such as tanzanite (a
stunning violet blue), tsavorite (a vivid electric green) and rhodelite
(brilliant burgundy).
A more common way into jewellery is, of course, one of the degree
courses in design and manufacture available at a number of colleges, or
to go straight from school into an eight-year apprenticeship with a
major manufacturer and repairer.
This last-named can lead to a place on a degree course but in either
case, says Buchanan, it is an idea to seek a temporary post -- even
unpaid -- with a top manufacturer in order to learn the fundamentals of
the design and construction of mainstream jewellery.
''No-one else is going to give you their jewellery to play around
with,'' he says. ''But as you acquire expertise and confidence, and
discover an ability to give the customer exactly what is wanted, this is
certainly a challenging and rewarding profession.''

DISTRIBUTION and records storage group Hays turned in excellent
full-year results with pre-tax profits rising 26% to #110m partly
because it gained substantial amounts of new business. That was achieved
on overall turnover increasing by 28%, excluding acquisitions, to #808m.
Chairman Ronnie Frost is still very much on the acquisition trail,
with two deals amounting to #9m since the June year-end, one for a Dutch
commercial records management company, the other for Apollo Despatch
courier services which has 14,000 business customers.
Profits were also helped by improvement in the global chemical
business which helped boost margins in Hays' chemical distribution
operations. Document exchange also expanded, helping profits in the
commercial division rise 19%.
But the greatest gain was seen in personnel. The 73% surge in profit
reflected the increasing emphasis on temporary staff by employers
reluctant to take people on permanently. Hays is now expanding into IT
placements to complement its existing accountancy employment activities.
Mr Frost said the new year had started well and prospects continued to
be encouraging both in the UK and overseas.
The dividend total has been raised 15% to 7p with a 4.75p final.
The shares closed unchanged at 359p and yield 2.45 while trading at
19.2 times historic earnings.

A GROUP of 11 Scottish companies producing and selling specialist
items for golf clinched #600,000 of new business at the US Professional
Golf Association trade show in Las Vegas last week.
The companies, selling everything from tartan trousers to antique
clubs, exhibited at a stand organised by Scottish Trade International.
''It was an outstanding success. We got orders worth about #600,000,''
said Robert Thompson, whose Paisley-based firm Antique Golf was one of
the participants.
Mr Thompson said 23 Scottish golf companies belong to a recently
formed export group, Links of Scotland, which hopes to send an even
bigger delegation to the next US PGA conference in Orlando, Florida, in
January.
''The companies which were at the stand in Las Vegas all did extremely
well and they want to go again,'' he said.
Mr Thompson said that next time it was hoped to include Scottish
manufacturers of knitwear, waterproofs and glassware, who were missing
at the Las Vegas trade show.
His own firm sells golf clubs, balls and memorabilia dating from 1840
to 1920.

A GLIMMER of light in the gloomy housing market was reported today.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' latest survey of members
practising as estate agents showed interest from potential buyers
exceeded expectations in August, which is traditionally a quiet month.
''This is encouraging because it could herald the beginning of an
increase in the number of transactions,'' said a spokesman.
''August turned out to be a better month in some ways than expected,
and interest rate reductions by mortgage lenders should help to boost
purchaser confidence over the coming few weeks -- albeit from a low
base.''
While a third of those questioned reported lower house prices in the
previous three months -- the worst figure for three years -- two-thirds
said prices had remained stable in their area.

LIBERAL Democrat president Robert Maclennan is famous for making
speeches which are worthy but dull. He admitted as much yesterday in his
address to the faithful at the party's annual conference in Glasgow.
''You know me,'' he said. ''Cautious till you could scream. Very
slightly pedantic.'' His speech yesterday was worthy but far from dull.
The style of delivery, like a zombie on speed, was fascinating enough.
But it was the sheer variety of source material that kept listeners on
the edge of their seats waiting to hear what reference was coming next.
Oor Bob gave us Abbe Sieyes who said of the French Revolution: ''I
survived.'' This was a reference to John Major who might say something
similar about his time as leader of the Conservative Party.
Then we had a touch of Alfred Hitchcock as the present Tory Government
was likened to the Bates Motel: ''I don't say they actually stab you in
the shower but most people want to get out.''
The Labour Party, said Bob, reminded him of Debussy's comment on the
works of Edward Grieg: ''Pink bonbons stuffed with snow.''
Onwards to quotes from E M Forster, Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a
Boat and a poet called Roy Campbell.
It was across the Atlantic for a daud of Jeffersonian theory (''he
governs best who governs least'') and Theodore Roosevelt talking about
''the malefactors of great wealth''.
And there was the ubiquitous Gazza. President Bob bemoaned the fact
that while society suffers so many ills, the headline news is ''Gazza
dyed his hair blue for his England game''. It was black, Bob, but never
mind.
In one dazzling section of the speech, Bob made passing references in
consecutive sentences to Oscar Wilde, Rabbie Burns, and Danton (another
chap from the French Revolution, Georges-Jacques of that Ilk, who was
famous for his audacity).
Having brought his Lib Dem colleagues all the way to Scotland, the MP
for Caithness obviously felt compelled to give them a bit of the local
lingo. The Scots having their own parliament but maintaining the same
level of representation would be buttering our bannocks on both sides.
Bob even tried to get his refined tones round some Rab C Nesbitt-style
Glesgaspeak. Britain was ''goin' doon the stank'' he said. ''But haud
on, Jimmy. There is another alternative.''
Yes, vote for a Liberal Democrat MP in Govan.
Curious kitty
BACK on familiar territory was Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, gracing the
platform at the SECC. Lord Jenkins also graces the headed notepaper of a
Lib Dem initiative called the Dagger Wine Club.
The dagger bit is less sinister than it sounds. It stands for the
Democrat's Action Group for Gaining Electoral Reform. The wine club is a
fund-raising venture which involves members lobbing #1 a month into a
kitty.
Half of the cash is spent on an upmarket case of wine, which goes to
whoever's name comes out the hat. The rest goes to the campaign to
secure the group's aim of having the single transferable vote used in
all British elections. We'll drink to that.
Early warning
BUT it's not all devolution, single transferable votes, and listening
to Bob Maclennan at the Lib Dem conference. There is also the early
morning sex.
Well, sex education to be exact, which is or was (depends when you're
reading this) the subject for debate at a fringe meeting at 8am this
morning in the Moat House Hotel. A continental breakfast will be or was
served, presumably followed by a cigarette.
The event is chaired by the exotically named Baroness Hamwee. It is
organised by the Sex Education Forum who refer to their work in schools
as the ''Fourth R''.
What is the fourth R? No, you filthy child at the back, it is not
rumpy-pumpy. The R stands for relationships.
Biting humour
SPOTTED on the cafe menu at the David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre,
a dish called ''Kwasongs'' served with side salad at #1.95. Some exotic
dish to celebrate the great explorer's African connections? No. Closer
inspection by our informant, Margaret Gray of Glasgow, revealed the item
to be what our French cousins have for breakfast.
Now you know
DEPT of Potentially Acrimonious Acronyms: Glasgow City Council has
been given Euro-funding for a project called RESET. It is nothing to do
with dodgy car radios, videos, or other stolen goods. The initials stand
for Renewable Energies Strategy in European Towns.
Chorus of approval
DIARY reader John Boyle of Ardrossan, perusing the Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum Christmas catalogue, comes across the perfect present for
Monklands Man. You have drunk the strong wine, had the hangover, and
perhaps served the 30 days for the breach of the peace.
Now listen to the CD. We are talking about Carols from Buckfast, sung
by the choir of the abbey where they make the wine that made Monklands
famous. Available by mail order from the V &amp; A at #10.95.
Unlucky bag
IT is back-to-college time and a chap called Gerry is in touch with
details of the goodie bag which Kilmarnock College is handing out to its
students. The bag for male students contains a free sample of Insignia
aftershave, a Lion bar, a Drifter bar, a packet of Chinese-flavour
noodles, a free Bic razor marked ''free only with McDonald's breakfast,
drugs helpline information, and a leaflet called A Whole New Ball Game
on how to check for testicular cancer.
The bag for female students had a free sample of Witch Doctor gel
instead of the aftershave and all of the rest of the above-mentioned
goodies. Including the Whole New Ball Game leaflet.

CAN there be a more poisonous pen club than that which brings together
a quarrel of crime writers? If anything this rumpus between P D James
and her funkier contemporaries demonstrates a long-held suspicion that
when it comes to criticism neither type of mystery scribe is tolerant.
Instead they all believe that the first rule of the craft, because I say
so, is an explanation which sufficiently covers everything.
But what we have here now is snobbery versus gritty realism; blood on
the carpet versus blood in the urinal. The trouble began with that
statement given by the Baroness of Holland Park to the BBC World Service
in which James implied she believed moral choice belonged only to the
middle class.
Immediately this triggered outrage among the street-fight literati who
anyway consider James's thrillers to be over-cerebral, contrived, and
lost up their own imperious line of inquiry. James's response has been
to threaten her resignation from the Crime Writers' Association, but now
comes news of another snub.
The word from the Boucheran -- the World Mystery Convention which is
to be held in Nottingham at the end of this month -- is that James has
removed herself from the guest list. No official motive is evident and
the organisers insist her withdrawal was communicated before the row
developed into a story of insult and envy, privilege and slumming.
But now instead of examining the body of crime fiction in all its
guises in Nottingham, ''her eminence'' -- as James is known in the book
trade -- will address a British Council gathering in Greece. Still, her
absence from the convention is unlikely to close the file on that
interview with the World Service.
''If you set it (a detective story) in the pits of the worst possible
inner-city area, where crime is the norm, you don't get moral choice,''
she said. ''You don't get contrasts between good and evil.'' Well, tell
that to Ed McBain, whose criminals and snitches, good cops, rotten cops,
whackos and uprights have given us the jagged parade of humanity which
makes him one of the best thriller-tellers in the world.
Practically every line of McBain expresses the morality of social
anger; the blazing disgust at neglect and collapse within our cities, at
the ratty stench of squalid housing, at the rubble of loneliness and the
no-hoper ambushed by hell.
Every page smells of New York. The man may fudge actual location but
it is there, that metallic thwack against the nostrils, and the dry,
yeasty whiff of bagels. The sweat of warm flesh in the subway and the
tar-inhalant of fire burning in oil drums along the Bowery on
zero-temperature nights. By expanding the boundries of mystery so that
his work is not merely a whodunnit, McBain convincingly brings us the
hades of the universal city.
None of this need concern James, of course, because her detective Adam
Dalgliesh seems designed principally to inhabit the Gothic imagination
of the English bourgeoisie. James began in the tradition of detective
novelists who dwell in an artificial milieu of suave dissemblers. The
villain never lives below stairs or in the vulgar world. Like Dalgliesh,
the villain might be dressed by Savile Row.
Dorothy Sayers fell in love with Lord Peter Wimsey. Ruth Rendell's
Inspector Wexford, from stolid beginnings, has become increasingly
bookish. Inspector Morse, with his endless agonising, is an
embarrassment. And Adam Dalgliesh belongs in the drawingroom, not the
interrogation cell, a pretentious and unbelievable creation. His first
appearance was as a plain detective inspector but he soon became
commander of a new squad investigating cases which required a special
sensitivity.
This allowed Dalgliesh to indulge his poetic soul: ''After four years
of silence, his new book of poetry, A Case To Answer and Other Poems,
had been published to considerable critical acclaim which was
surprisingly gratifying, and to even wider public interest which, less
surprisingly, he was finding more difficult to take . . .'' As Dalgliesh
has become loftier so James has perhaps come to believe herself more
novelist than crime hack, more Trollope than Christie.
Adam Dalgliesh would never cause his author the seedy problems McBain
encounters with his cops. But McBain is not a man for smug red herrings
or precious conversation over claret. He is too busy snooping about the
sidewalks, in and out of strangers' shadows, collar upturned, and ear
cocked for the heist rap. And then he goes home and talks to himself,
jotting down the conversation . . . until a shot rings out.

WHITBREAD, the retailing and drinks group, is putting its huge
marketing and retailing muscle into a new opportunity in the High
Street. It has bought the 41-strong Costa Coffee chain and intends
opening about 30 new shops a year for the next few years.
Costa was founded by Italian-born Sergio Costa 30 years ago but he is
now retiring. The sum being paid has not been disclosed.
Originally a blender and roaster of beans, the business was later
expanded into the cafe format with the emphasis on the premium end of
the market.
Its Scottish operations include shops at Edinburgh and Glasgow
airports and Glasgow's Central and Queen Street stations.
Turnover in the year to June 1994 amounted to #55m, with the bulk of
revenue coming from the retailing operations. However, the traditional
wholesaling is still making a substantial contribution thanks to the
swing away from freeze-dried instant coffee back towards roasted and
ground fresh coffee. This has led its market share to recover from 20%
to about 40% over the last decade.
Whitbread's Mike Johnson said research by the Henley Forecasting
Centre had shown that the mini-treat lower spend and small occasion food
and drink market will be a huge growth area for the rest of the deade.
Costa will complement Whitbread's other retailing interests which
include Pizza Hut, TGI Fridays, Beefeater restaurants and pubs and the
Brewers Fayre family-orientated pubs.

YESTERDAY I put on the TV and watched Malcolm Bruce make a bad speech
to the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow. It was read, every line
of it; it had every political cliche I had ever heard, and a few more
besides; the Gordon MP spoke in a quick monotone, punctuated by a
tubercular cough. Yet, at regular intervals, they hailed him in bored
applause.
Politicians still pretend -- and we journos play along with them,
being kind -- that these autumn events matter; that, if Bournemouth
sneezes, Britain will shortly share the Lem-Sip. But party conferences
no longer wield power. They now serve to treat faithful party activists,
and as a PR showcase for the nation. So the patter of applause, the
potted flowers, the tilted perspex of the ''sincerity machine,'' the
Churchillian cadences of the leader's speech -- these are, today, as
much a part of autumn as bonfires and conkers.
This autumn, however, signals a shift in gear. Three and a half years
have passed since the last General Election and, once these jamborees
are over, we will be increasingly gripped by the polls to come. In
normal times we would expect them in the spring or summer of next year.
These are not normal times. Most expect a General Election in the spring
of 1997, about as late as it can be postponed by law.
What has taken on the air of certainty is that the Conservatives will
lose. Only miraculous rejuvenation could renew this lot's lease on
power. Conservatism has achieved nothing in this Parliament apart from
some panic legislation, ill-conceived attempts to privatise trains, and
a fraught unity over Europe.
They have run out of new blood. The back benches bristle with the
sacked, retired, and resigned has-beens of men failed in government or
smeared by scandal; besides them, there are a few greenhorns (like
Sebastian Coe) and the unemployable, like Tony Marlow. Time, too, has
drained leaders of credibility. Does anyone really believe, say, Kenneth
Clarke's mouthings on recovery, or Malcolm Rifkind's views on Scottish
home rule? Do we sense that they believe them themselves?
For the Tories, once history is written, the infamous Black Wednesday
may be seen as the nemesis. That day in September 1992 blew Major's
economic policies apart and ravaged his personal credibility. It ended
the Tories' greatest electoral asset: the reputation as the party of
sound money. Its huge costs -- Norman Lamont squandered more, in one
day, vainly trying to save the pound than the Kinnock Government would
have spent on the NHS in four years -- forced new and hideously
unpopular taxes. Not least, Black Wednesday tore the Tories apart on
Europe. Until this July Major was racked, and racked again by his own
back benchers. The Prime Minister, with sharp judgment and desperate
courage, has for the moment emasculated the power of his anti-Europe
lobby. But he has failed to renew his party or revive his Government. He
holds only the honour of losing the next election.
The Tories seem set to fall, come polling day, but that does not mean
that Labour are set to win. The swing required for a Labour victory --
6% on the 1992 result -- is, in fact, a tall order. Besides, Labour is
still haunted by its past. The national folk memory fears the trade
unions and does not trust Labour on money. It is haunted by the present,
where big-spending, entrenched Labour still wroughts much of our local
government. This late in Parliament, Labour has yet to articulate clear
policies or outline anything beyond high-sounding principles. Blair,
like Smith before him, has spun out time in leading Labour to reform
itself. Of this the nation is wearying.
At least Blair is not Neil Kinnock, a man the public never trusted.
But neither is he John Smith, with experience of Government. Blair is
charming, confident, and elegant. So was Anthony Eden; but No 10 proved
a step too high for his talent.
Of this Labour may be sure. The Tories will shortly offer us all tax
cuts, and such middle-class goodies Labour will be unable to threaten.
Further, many who have made Major's life miserable for the past three
years -- the cheap Tory press, the CBI, the major financial
institutions, Baroness Thatcher -- will, come the dissolution, go
scampering home to mummy. One should not over-rate the power of the
press. But the tabloid onslaught on Kinnock in 1992 may well have made
the difference that cold April, between power and oblivion.
Then, of course, there are the Liberal Democrats. For them, a decade
after the alliance, the end of the century offers little. The public
cannot slide a fruitknife between Labour and Lib Dem noises. Ashdown,
our most senior party leader, sounds time-served tinny. In the tactical
squeeze of the next election, the Liberal Democrats may well emerge with
more seats, but their overall vote share seems likely to decline.
Fifteen per cent would be very good.
Later this week, the SNP is to convene at Perth. It was at Perth five
years ago, in fact, that Alex Salmond became leader. Salmond, over this
time, has grudgingly won the regard of political professionals. He may
not be greatly liked, but he is steady; he does not panic, and he
responds to abuse (of which he has had much) with calm mirth.
Perth will remind Salmond and friends of how far they have revived
over the past decade. They meet in a city with an SNP MP, an SNP provost
and under three SNP councils. But the nationalists will have to face a
General Election where the broad game is not in their interests: a Tory
Government on the way out and a new voter-friendly Labour Party fair set
for the way in.
Many Scots voters will give Labour that chance. Many defecting Tories,
indeed, who might once have gone Lib Dem or SNP in their pique, may go
straight to Mr Blair. What will not work for the SNP, this poll coming,
will be such good old lines as ''Who'll save Scotland when England votes
Tory again?'' Watch them, then, piling on the heat over Labour's
devolution commitment and, after the last debacle, a much more focused
SNP campaign with the hope of some six-to-a-dozen seats.
On Wednesday, indeed, I shall be in Perth myself, being spared, if
only for such joys as flirting with Winnie Ewing and sampling the home
baking. And the Tay will flow by, as it ran before all those politicians
and their fixes, and as it will run when they have all gone, even to the
end of time.

THE proposed University of the Highlands and Islands and higher
education in New York's toughest inner-city neighbourhoods are worlds
apart. But the shared conviction that higher education should not be
confined to established institutions and should be of relevance to
people in all communiites brought the two together with a bang when
three New York academics included a visit to the Highlands between
conferences in Edinburgh on access to education.
Founded in 1904 by the Ursuline Order in Westchester County, a
well-heeled suburb of New York, the college of New Rochelle has an
impeccable pedigree as the first Catholic college for women in New York
State. It shocked the educational establishment when it started
undergraduate courses in downtown Manhattan for members of the biggest
municipal workers' union. Further courses in makeshift campuses in
community centres and disused schools in the Bronx and Harlem prompted
the newspaper headline: What's a nice college like you doing in a place
like this?
The answer was bringing higher education to communities which were
previously excluded from it. By-passed is the word used by Bessie Blake,
Dean of the School of New Resources. Continuing the roads analogy, she
describes the scheme as building ramps to the superhighway of education
for communities isolated by the fast-moving traffic.
In the revolutionary years of the early 70s, many higher-education
establishments suffered identity crises. In that context New Rochelle
examined its access policies and the Ursuline sisters, having noted that
educational research showed that parental involvement was the most
important factor for children's progress in education, dedided that
working with adults was the most crucial step for social change. They
had no intention of moving outwith their own area, but a small
advertisement for adult would-be students caught the eye of the leader
of the very powerful municipal workers' union.
The result was a partnership in which the college would provide the
staff and teaching, and the union would provide the premises. It was an
act of faith which provided a liberal arts framework in which trade
union members could improve their skills for both life and work. The DC
37 Campus housed in the Lower Manhattan headquarters of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is still the only
full-time degree offered at a trade union headquarters. It is only one
of seven campuses across New York, each serving distinct communities.
Bessie Blake thinks that one of the most important aspects of the
School of New Resources is that it not only offers courses in the
students' communities, but keeps their new skills there afterwards, as
teachers, social workers and managers. The School of New Resources is
based on the principle that entry to college should lead to employment
and advancement on graduation. Students are over the age of 21 but may
be working or unemployed, some are what the Americans call structurally
unemployed: the second or third generation to have no work.
One campus is based at the New York Theological Seminary and most of
the students are working ministers and assistants in small parishes
throughout the city. Co-op City campus is based in the biggest
concentration of skyscrapers in America and started life in a basesment
until Bessie Blake breezed in and announced it was ''Lower level Co-op
City''. The Brooklyn Campus has tapped into New York's first urban
regeneration scheme and as a result boasts an art gallery, arts centre
and theatre. In many ways, though, it is the Rosa Parks Campus which
exemplifies the potential of the School of New Resources.
''If you can tackle the problems in the Harlem community, you can do
it anywhere in New York, in the US, and I would say in the world. There
is everything you can think of -- homelessness, ill-health, domestic
violence, addiction, drug-addicted babies. Yet out of the struggle comes
amazing creativity, some of our greatest writers and musicians come from
Harlem even today. Yet the same problems exist in Westchester County.
Because it is so stunningly beautiful, people imagine there are no
welfare mothers or poverty, but it is just that the challenges are not
so apparent,'' she said.
That struck an immediate chord with people in the Highlands including
Hilary Lawson, organiser of the Workers' Educational Association in
Inverness. She invited colleagues from Inverness College and people
working on the proposal for a University of the Highland to an informal
exchange of ideas with Dr Blake and her colleagues.
Dr Blake insists that higher education can be brought to any community
if the will is there. The College of New Rochelle does not have a big
endowment. The funding for the Scool of New Resources comes from a
variety of sources: from the trade unions and the churches from Federal
sources and a variety of trusts.

LOWER bad debt provisions and higher interest income helped half-year
profits at Britannia Building Society climb to #50.6m, the group
announced yesterday.
The earnings for the six months to end-June compare with pre-tax
profits of #46.8m in the first half of last year.
''Improvements to the mortgage underwriting process have continued to
reap rewards as provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 11%
reflecting enhanced asset quality,'' said chairman Calum MacLeod.

Gerard Seenan finds a book shop selling hands-on training for the
Internet
AS the information revolution known as the Internet hurtles onwards,
the more traditional purveyors of knowledge have decided to get in on
the act.
John Smith &amp; Son has become the first bookseller in Scotland to offer
public access to the Internet through its Internet Learning Centre at
its Glasgow store. For #1.95 per half hour, members of the public can
surf or, for the more inept, stagger around in cyberspace.
The centre is staffed by a work force familiar with the intricacies of
Internet access and can provide the initial training needed for net
navigation. And, for those who feel the apprehension associated with
Luddite thoughts coming on, the centre's manager, Barry Fogarty, is
certain that any initial trepidation will be dispelled instantaneously.
''It only takes a member of staff around 10 minutes to teach someone
the basics of Internet access, after that they are perfectly able to
browse around themselves. But if they need any more help we are happy to
give it,'' he says.
Public access centres, such as this, afford a prime opportunity for
pupils and teachers to gain access to a vast array of information
resources that would generally be unavailble in the classroom situation.
Last week Clyde Valley High School, Wishaw, used the centre for just
such a purpose.
''We don't have Internet access at the school as yet so this gives the
kids a first opportunity to see how it works. It gives them a flavour of
the depth and breadth of information they can access and shows them that
its relevant to every subject they study,'' said Kieron Fallon, a
computing teacher at the school.
No doubt in common with many pupils, this was the first time most of
the students had had any direct contact with the Internet. ''I have seen
it on the television and read about it, but this is the first time I've
ever used it,'' said 4th-year pupil, Simon Kirkwood.
Although they weren't quite ready for waxing their boards and hitting
the waves, after the initial induction the pupils felt up to a little
trepid surfing.
''I've never used the Internet before and I didn't really know what it
was,'' said Sharon McFarlane, 13. ''But I have learned about its
history, where it comes from, how it started and how to use it. I think
I could find information I was looking for after a while.''
Another pupil Aliah Ashraf, 13, was confident that she could now make
use of the Internet in her studies. ''I think it would come in very
useful for projects and investigations in lots of different subjects,''
she said.
The Internet Learning Centre is intended primarily for individuals,
but John Smith's are happy to arrange school visits on appointment.

A NEW range of go-anywhere bags are available this autumn from Kangol,
the hat people.
The company has linked up with Alpa UK to produce a selection of bags
aimed at the youth market. The styling is certainly funky, ranging from
record and courier bags, to mini backpacks and rucksacks, to purses.
Naturally Kangol's big black kangaroo logo features prominently on the
bag collection. From granny hats to cool backpacks, does label branding
know no bounds?

Dick Louden hears of a rare case where an educational body's cash
surplus is redistributed among its customers
IT makes a refreshing change these days to hear of an organisation
which takes steps to share its financial surplus with its customers. The
Scottish Vocational Education Council (Scotvec) -- the body responsible
for national vocational awards -- has decided to reduce by up to 10% the
fees it receives for administering its range of qualifications.
The fee for a National Certificate module or a workplace unit goes
down from #3.80 to #3.60, while the charge for a group award -- an
all-in fee including enrolment, certification and verification -- is
reduced from #77.50 to #70 for the Higher National Certificate and from
#92.50 to #85 in the case of the Higher National Diploma. For students
taking individual Higher National units but not enrolled for a group
award, each unit is now charged at #9 instead of #10. In addition, the
''annual retainer'' fee of #100 which has been levied until now on many
of Scotvec's approved centres is being scrapped.
Colleges, local authorities and many Scottish businesses will derive
financial benefit from this initiative. Tom McCool, Scotvec's chief
executive, attributes it in particular to the increased levels of
student registrations which have continued unabated in recent years.
Founded only 10 years ago, Scotvec now has well over a million National
Certificate module enrolments per year, while unit registrations for its
Higher National awards have doubled in a very short time to a new record
of over 300,000 and would no doubt have continued to soar if the
Scottish Office had not decided recently to ''cap'' them at current
levels.
It gives Tom McCool genuine satisfaction to be able to reduce fees in
this way. ''Schools, colleges, local authorities, business and industry
have been our partners all along,'' he says. ''It is thanks to them that
our awards have acquired such credibility and that their uptake has gone
on rising. It is only right that we recognise our partnership with them
by reducing their financial burden when we are able to do so.''
This happy position has arisen because Scotvec, previously financed
largely by the Scottish Office and the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, became self-financing in 1993 and, through a blend of
entrepreneurial spirit and efficient housekeeping, has achieved
surpluses in the last two years of #1.2m and #1.4m.
Valuable income has been built up by winning large contracts such as
maintaining the Streetworks Qualifications Register and administering
national examinations for the Police Promotions Board and, on behalf of
the Department of Transport, the marine exams for deck officers and
engineers. Publications bring in revenue of around #100,000 per year.
International consultancy work in areas like Africa and the Middle East
has also been developed vigorously.
According to Dr Don Giles, director of administration and finance,
Scotvec did not raise its fees from 1984 to 1988 and there has been no
increase since 1993. ''As well as reducing fees now -- a happy
coincidence in our tenth anniversary year -- we are also planning to
enhance our level of service by providing our centres with more support
material, especially in the area of assessment where they have indicated
that they would particularly welcome it,'' he says, anticipating that
this measure, allied to the reduction in fees, will still leave Scotvec
with ''a modest surplus''.
Colleges, which have become increasingly concerned about their
financial health since they assumed self-financing status two years ago,
will certainly welcome the smaller fees to be charged by Scotvec. Dr
Giles estimates that an average-sized establishment will save at least
#15,000, while Aberdeen College, the largest in Scotland, will benefit
by around #25,000.
It all serves to confirm that Scotvec has come a long way in 10 short
years. An organisation which rewards its customers with fee reductions
is certainly sending out the right messages. In due course it is to be
merged with the Scottish Examination Board and that should enhance
further the esteem in which its vocational qualifications are held.
Nor will it be adversely affected by the recent news from south of the
Border that General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs), which
were supposed to become England's ''vocational A Levels'', have come
under heavy criticism. Whereas GNVQs were introduced hastily and with
minimal preparation, Scotvec had firmly laid the ground for its recently
launched equivalents, General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(GSVQs). National Certificate modules, from which GSVQs are formed, had
been established for a number of years and were already enjoying
enormous popularity when GSVQs were implemented on a phased and
controlled basis. Now they have been given the Scottish Office's stamp
of approval by being included in the unified curricular framework
proposed under ''Higher Still'' and their future is assured.

AMID a season of vintage classics, the Bentley of the fashion world
has to be the big camel coat.
Stylish and cosmopolitan, the big camel coat belongs to the great
cities of the world and can stride out to take lunch anywhere from Paris
to London, from Tokyo to New York.
It is also the perfect foil -- not to say overcoat -- for this
season's natty little suits delicately offsetting the more sombre colour
palette from plum through to grey, brown, and black while at the same
time providing a visual counterpoint to this year's sometime affair with
pillar box red and monochrome tones.
In terms of styling, the field is open from straight sixties' numbers
through to expansive swing coats meant to be worn open and flowing. In
terms of 1995 acceptability, bigger coats are all the better for
wrapping around this autumn and winter's tailored suits.
However, whatever their colour, coats will generally provide a
semblance of modernity over the range of 1940s to 1960s inspired attire
on display. Coats after all are a reasonable investment from which we
expect a return of more than a year. Generously cut the emphasis is on
bulk and warmth for a hard-working exterior which battles with the
elements and wins.

In this 16-page Herald supplement, Hilda McLean cuts a dash through
awesome autumn and wonderful winter wardrobe essentials.
GOING into autumn 1995, it is obvious that in sartorial terms we are
entering another era.
To call it a new era would be incorrect, for many will see it as
turning back the clock to days when ladies wore gloves, hats, and
carried neat little handbags which didn't bulge with work accoutrements.
After a good few seasons, when the wearer called the shots with
slap-dash clothes, this year sees the en masse return of strict
tailoring and good grooming, last seen on any grand scale in the late
fifties; clothes this season maketh the women.
There have been a few warnings in winters past, but in 1995 the big
push towards proper dressing kicks off in earnest.
Natty little suits, in their many variations from skirt to trousers or
shift dress and jacket, neatly profile the female form and recall those
icons of chic Audrey Hepburn, Jackie O, and Grace Kelly.
All women of another era, who in their heyday were not exactly
feminist heroines, they are being held up as the way forward for fashion
this season. Their role is not as the definitive template as in the
past, but as the inspiration for clothes redolent of the structured
forties and fifties with their nipped-in waists and air of well-groomed
presentation which cuts across nationalistic boundaries bringing
together the most sophisticated of American and European influences.
As others have already stated, after decades of dressing women as
everything from starlets to harlets in pantomime or even boudoir gear,
this time round the designers are going for something a lot more radical
. . . they want us to be neat and tidy.
But they want us to be chic while we are doing it. For some this will
spell a return to the power suit. And there are a few hints of sharp
reds and scary stilettoes around. However, the look this season is more
the little woman who wields her power quietly behind the scenes; a woman
whose high maintenance costs are discreetly dealt with by the charge
card and are never arrogantly or brazenly flaunted.
Certainly it is not all about being saintly spick and span. Modern
women's recognition that she need never slavishly follow the dictates of
fashion in contradiction to her lifestyle means that the design houses
can not lay down the law. Nor can they afford to take too narrow a
perspective on any new emerging direction.
Tailored suits are not always tight; some are even kittenish with mini
A-lines and cute collars straight out of the sixties. Fake fur prints on
skirts and trimmings also increase the swing factor and pump up the fun
level. Further undermining of the pristine profile presented by the
season's outerwear comes from the lingerie section, where it is evident
decadent designers are creating some rich concoctions too precious to
keep hidden.
At the teenage/club end of the market, there is some dabbling with old
sixties' thoughts of space age clothing which in terms of the mass
market will work its way through in the acceptability of metallic and
brightly coloured gilets and puffa jackets. However, a word of warning,
these are strictly for the young at heart.
The new mood will of course have a knock-on effect across the dressing
spectrum but many favourites from the last few seasons can be reined to
accommodate this change in direction and others will remain with us as
well-loved friends.
Floaty florals can be brought into line with belts while comfy and
easy knitwear will probably always have a place in the Scottish market
-- and what could be wrong with that.
Men are also having to sharpen up their sartorial act in the new
season as structured, tailored clothes become the norm. For men this
means the re-emergence of the sharp suit for all. Part 1950s English
gent, part 1960s Mod, the 1995 suit might not demand a short back and
sides but it will require good grooming and grace.
The knock-on effect for men is that even the casual sector will
experience a change of direction with simple easy-to-wear but
essentially neat clothes taking over from layers and sporty gear.

POWER dressing has sloped off in terms of ''superbitch'' shoulders,
but a quieter, more assured confidence is evident, particularly in the
suits inspired by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
This, after all, was a woman who may not have been at the fore
heedlessly busting males' bastions like Baroness Thatcher, but as Jack
Kennedy's wife Jackie was the power behind not just a token throne but a
potentially globe-obliterating button.
Then as Jackie O, she was the channel for millions of dollars created
by the supertanker trade. The money from Aristotle Onassis and his ships
passed through her and then via the retailers into an economy lifted by
her sartorial spending sprees.
The keynote outfit for any Jackie O fan is the smart little shift
dress with matching jacket. Purists can find the essential Jackie suit
with a boxy jacket in the Olivier Strelli range, but at Pied a Terre
they have some easier-to-wear forties-style jackets which are not cheap
but in the middle range of prices.
These are teamed with more sixties-style shift dresses which are
designed to look good with or without a turtle neck underneath,
providing an outfit which can glide through the dying days of humidity
and then cope with the chill in the air. Boucle material created from
wool looped together with other fabrics provides a base for long wear
with a softer feel.
House of Fraser also has some natty matching dress and jacket suits.
Look out for Peter Pan collars for a flying-high fashion touch. Like
Pied a Terre, matching skirts are available for three-way options which
provide the most mileage.
Another label to check out for a nifty shift dress suit is the Grace
Collection, which as the name suggests is a design house which
implicitly understands elegant styles and its collections over the past
few years have borne this out.
Its Jackie O contribution is a beautiful A-line shift topped by a
wider-collared jacket which is available only in a rather appealing
dusky pink colour they call blossom.

CONSIDER this. There was much wailing and gnashing from within Tony
Blair's inner circle last week over the leak of the internal strategy
document which proclaimed that Labour was not yet ready -- at least at
the time of writing seven months ago -- to take over the reins of
Government.
What was interesting, however, was the direction in which this spleen
was vented. While some anger was turned inward to the more responsible,
this was not the main focus. After all, when the inner circle excludes
the deputy leader and a number of other veteran figures in the party at
a time when policies and alignment are being radically altered, a degree
of friction is to be expected. No, what caused real outrage wasn't the
source of the leak but its recipient, the Guardian newspaper.
Not only had a historically left-leaning newspaper taken possession of
such a gifthorse to the right, it had resolutely declined to examine the
story's dental health before allowing it to canter across its front
page.
The stewards in due course inquired. Employing a phrase to be used
within two days by Tories infuriated by a leak highlighting flaws in
their education policy, a Guardian reader wrote expressing himself
''incandescent with rage'' at the paper's calumny and betrayal of the
Labour Party -- seemingly oblivious to the irony of the fact that for
years fellow readers have railed against the Tory props of what used to
be Fleet Street for their dogged refusal to bite the hand that feeds.
Let's be clear. Hands that feed should be bitten from time to time, if
only to demonstrate that the watchdog is still awake and in possession
of at least some of its fangs.
But the Labour leader's camp could not see this. Mr Blair himself,
fresh from a lengthy courtship ritual involving press magnate Rupert
Murdoch, complained that the Sun had supposedly given fairer coverage to
his TUC speech than that which appeared in the Guardian.
But wasn't this the whole point of him currying favour with News
Corporation? ''It (the Guardian) is as bad as the Express and Mail,''
whinged one Blair aide. The complaint was made to the Sunday Times, a
newspaper which itself, although a bastion of the right, splashed new
revelations on the guns-for-Iraq scandal and carried another story about
the power struggle at the top of the Conservative Party. Neither Mr
Blair nor his ubiquitous aides leapt in to complain over this turn of
events.
Newspapers align and realign all the time to some degree, whether that
comes as a matter of internal policy, or external change in the
political circumstances or even down to individual commentators and
their sources. If former Tory loyalists in the press sometimes take the
muzzle off, for whatever motive, it is rich for the left to demand
lapdog complacency.
Journalists in some newspapers, and you are reading one now, are like
strays who go without muzzles at all times. Terriers rather than pit
bulls, we're expected to have regular nips at passing politicians of all
colours if only to remind them that we're there. Some other red-fanged
beasts in the press pound are fed only a certain flavour of meat so that
they acquire a particular taste.
Contrary to the saying, some dogs learn new tricks in their mature
years, managing to sit on laps licking the faces of those they used to
savage. One such is sitting just across from me as I write this in the
press area of the Liberal Democrat conference. He learned a new bark
under a new owner.
For it is the hand on the leash that remains paramount. Sometimes it
is an extending lead but by definition that still means it can be yanked
in, the hounds dragged back. At this time in the political cycle -- that
is late mid-term -- there are bones to be gnawed on and most are given a
long leash. Are Tony Blair and John Prescott falling out? What about
similar suggestions involving Michael Heseltine and Brian Mawhinney, or
Alex Salmond and some of his senior colleagues? Is Michael Forsyth's
reincarnation as a liberal innovator real?
Journalists given a long leash to sniff around questions like these
will in some cases be hauled back in when an election looms and owners
insist on a show of loyalty.
Closer to the General Election it will depend which hounds have owners
with fixed political views and at that time Opposition party leaders
will become grateful once more for the strays, even those who have
nipped their ankles.
In the case of last week's controversy the point is that Seamus Milne
got a damned good story for the Guardian and the paper ran it. Good.
Another leak on the failings of Tory education policy burrowed its way
out and newspapers of all political persuasions ran with it. Good. It is
what they are there for.
Into this fermenting late-mid-term brew north of the Border comes an
additional ingredient -- the Forsyth factor. Where before the Scottish
Office was a quiet place of which we knew little, the new incumbent
there is determined to turn St Andrew's House into the noisiest show in
town, something we cannot fail to notice. Behind this lie perfectly
sound reasons to do with his own political survival in his Stirling
constituency but it is fun none the less.
Michael Forsyth has plunged in, making him the centre of the Scottish
political scene from Day One. Cuddling up to Campbell Christie of the
STUC, saving the sleepers, plunging into controversy over drug
trafficking in tranquillisers and even turning community service into a
place on the chain gang, the former ideologue seems little concerned
about the coherence or consistency of his efforts. Pragmatism is all and
the Secretary of State may suddenly leap into the political traffic to
stop the bus and send it off to some new, unexpected destination.
All of this, of course,  makes him highly newsworthy across the media
spectrum for now but it won't be long before the hounds scent blood and
sink their teeth in.

Dick Louden finds much to commend in giving pupils a taste of Celtic's
''level playing field''
CELTIC Football Club and Strathclyde region have entered into a joint
initiative under which groups of around 25 secondary pupils, accompanied
by teachers, attend Celtic Park on match days. They are guests of the
club and watch the match but the initiative is about much more. It is
about fostering values at a formative age.
It is part of an overall PR strategy, just approved by the Celtic
board of directors, which incorporates a social charter embracing the
history of the club and the principles it stands for. ''Celtic is more
than a business,'' said PR manager Peter McLean. ''It is a social
institution.'' He offers the reminder that in 1888, when the club was
founded, dreadful poverty and child mortality in the east end of Glasgow
awaited the many Irish immigrants who settled there and that the club
was set up by Brother Walfrid to feed the starving children. The name
Celtic implied a bridge of culture across the Irish Sea.
Since then, according to Peter McLean, ''Memories have become clouded
and there are sectors of the community where it is still believed that
the club stands for bigotry.'' In its new strategy Celtic is therefore
reaching out across the community, involving not only schools but also
job clubs, rehabilitation projects, hostels for the homeless and the
East End Drugs Initiative.
Last season, when Celtic was in temporary residence at Hampden Park,
it ran its innovative scheme with schools on a pilot basis, with over
200 pupils enjoying the experience of a day at the national stadium.
Interestingly, most of the schools were non-denominational. ''Our club
aims to be seen to be open to all people,'' said Peter McLean. ''As well
as promoting football and portraying the club's history accurately, we
are keen to have pupils thinking in terms of proper values. We are also
sponsoring equal opportunities and this year we shall be inviting ethnic
minority groups.''
The initiative, strongly supported by chief executive Fergus McCann,
began when Stephen Joyce, acting as educational consultant to Celtic in
a voluntary capacity, contacted Strathclyde region, which readily
offered cooperation because of the potential links with personal and
social development. ''The scheme has conditions attached to it,'' said
Stephen Joyce. ''As well as fitting in with the 5-14 Programme and with
subjects like modern studies and PE in third and fourth years, it also
complements the initiatives on values being implemented by the Scottish
Football Association with the personal encouragement of team manager
Craig Brown. Pupils are expected to undertake certain work before,
during and after their visit.''
On match days the pupils have a reception and light refreshments and
are then guided through a discussion for 20 minutes on topics of their
own choice. This is followed by the chance to meet some of the players
and a club director. Now that Celtic are back in their superbly upgraded
stadium, there is also a tour of the trophy room, currently the proud
guardian of the Scottish Cup.
Before the game the pupils are issued with matchday files, asking them
to consider the importance of positive values in football like fair
play, appreciation of skills, respect for opponents and team spirit.
They are also asked to write down their impressions of the stadium, the
atmosphere, the supporters, the entertainment, the police on duty and
the ambulance and first-aid personnel.
Back in school, they are invited to devise a ranking in order of
importance of a number of values -- not only fair play, respect and team
spirit but also success, tolerance, individuality and loyalty to your
team.
Of over 160 questionnaires returned, the values attracting the highest
levels of support have been success, team spirit and appreciation of
skills, in that order. Intriguingly, individuality has come last. That
should please Michael Forsyth in his campaign for team sports!
Celtic's school guests this year are going to find an enormous buzz
about the place. So many season tickets -- around 26,000 -- have been
sold that a waiting list is being drawn up. The new era brought in by
Fergus McCann will mean a continuous search for success, sporting and
commercial, and it is significant that, amidst this revolution, the club
is finding time to reassert basic human values.
The first school to be entertained at Hampden Park under the scheme
was Hillhead High in Glasgow, and some of the pupils were recently
invited to Celtic Park to see the new facilities. In charge was guidance
teacher Brian Griffin, who explained that some of the pupils had never
been to a football match and some staff had never seen Hampden, never
mind inspecting the press box or meeting a director. ''The pupils asked
very pertinent questions of the players, such as -- 'Do you play for the
jersey or the money?' ''
Michelle Moran, in sixth year and a Celtic supporter, felt that being
invited to sit in the directors' box ''had a good effect on you''.
''You felt you had to hold back -- it taught you not just to shout out
all the time. I can always admire good play in other teams. I think
Brian Laudrup is great.''
Rajdeep Juttlay, a fifth-year pupil, had never seen a senior football
match until Celtic invited her. ''It was a really good atmosphere,'' she
said. ''I like good sportsmanship -- like accepting decisions and
getting on with the game. Bad sportsmanship is showing anger if a goal
is scored against you.''
Fraser Steedman, also in fifth year, is a Rangers follower. ''I used
to think it was tremendous if somebody beat Celtic -- especially Raith
Rovers in last season's Coca-Cola Cup. Now, after meeting the Celtic
players, I feel it was a bit of a shame the way they lost. They're just
normal people. I've heard Rangers supporters talk appreciatively about
good play by Celtic -- they may not applaud but they say it.''

Geraldine Abrahams discovers a remote further education college which
is building on the traditional seafaring skills of the Hebridean people
FOR the people of the Western Isles, as for any island population, the
sea is a major influence on the way of life, and has been a determining
factor in the economic survival of the communities there.
It is significant then that this year, Scotland's most remote further
education college, based at Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, has provided
one of the world's largest cruise ship companies with a number of its
engineering officer cadets.
Living in a remote environment, cut off from the commercial and
industrial infrastructure of the mainland, island dwellers are likely to
view the sea as presenting a double-edged sword, both creating a barrier
which limits options and at the same time providing a vital source of
employment.
Fishing has played, and continues to play, an enormous part in the
island economies. Ferry travel too provides direct and indirect job
opportunities both on the ships as well as on shore, and for the past
two centuries, the merchant marine has been a third major employer for
many Hebrideans.
In the 1970s and 1980s however, the increasingly competitive
marketplace together with the world recession forced the shipping
companies to rationalise their crews and take on foreign recruits at
much lower salaries than their British counterparts.
This had a very serious effect on the Western Isles where there has
always been a tradition of going away to sea.
A recovery in the 1990s has meant that the merchant marine has become
a fruitful source of employment once again, and the engineering students
who have completed their courses at Lews Castle College in Stornoway,
one of the smallest and most remote colleges in the UK, have been well
prepared to take advantage of this, particularly through the strong
links that have been forged with P&amp;O Cruises.
Out of 24 Engineering Officer Cadet places offered by P&amp;O Cruises this
year, eight were from Lews Castle College -- four mechanical engineers
and four electrical engineers.
In total, 35 former students of Lews Castle now work with P&amp;O Cruises,
four are with P&amp;O Containers and another four are employed by TK
Shipping.
This sound relationship between the world-renowned marine company and
the college on the Scottish island has been built on a foundation of
mutual respect and need.
It began in 1983, when the company recruited three cadets from Lews
Castle, together with those from colleges in Hull and London. The steady
increase from that time has been a testament to the skills and qualities
of the Lews Castle College students.
''These islands have a long seafaring tradition and it is most
encouraging to see young people acquiring practical skills and
qualifications which lead to good employment with prospects, but
maintaining a home base here on the islands,'' said Kenneth Paterson,
assistant principal at Lews Castle College.
The college runs two courses which produces students technically
eligible for a career with P&amp;O Cruises. They are the Higher National
Certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (via a National
Certificate in Electronics or by direct entry with Highers) or the
Higher National Diploma in Multidisciplinary Engineering (via a National
Certificate then Higher National Certificate in Mechanical Engineering
or direct entry to that with Highers). Howevere, as P&amp;O clearly state,
there are other qualities that help decide who would make the most
suitable officer cadets.
''P&amp;O look primarily for engineering skills, but we also look for
students who are able to adapt to life at sea,'' said David Colclough,
senior fleet personnel officer at P&amp;O Cruises. ''It is also important
that the officer cadets are polite, well-mannered and smart. People
going on cruises have spent a lot of money, so they expect courtesy from
the staff.''
The cruise ships usually have around 800 staff and while most are
involved in the ''hotel'' side of the operation, there are occasions
when the ship's maintenance staff will come into contact with
passengers, as David Colclough explained.
''The main part of the job is the operation and maintenance of the
ship's main and auxiliary engines, but it also entails looking after the
'hotel' equipment and air-conditioning unit.''
The starting salary for the Lews Castle College cadets is #6000 pa
plus all travelling expenses, full board and luxury liner food as well
as a full uniform allowance.
When the cadetship is completed, the salary rises to #17,000 pa tax
free, and senior engineering officers can earn up to #40,000 per year.
While it is impossible to predict the future with any real certainty,
P&amp;O are confident that jobs in the merchant marine will be secure.
''I have absolutely no doubt, the way the fleet is expanding,''
assured John Marden. ''We have just launched a new ship, the Oriana, an
addition to the fleet. This is an expanding business and P&amp;O is one of
the largest operators within it.''
And a long-term relationship with Lews Castle College? ''We have been
promoting liaison with Lews Castle, and we are very happy with
everything. They are good lads.''

A LONG hot summer passed natty little suits by, leaving thousands of
tightly tailored jackets and skirts hanging trim but forlorn on shop
shelves. But the time for the forties-style suit has definitely come
with the arrival of crisper mornings and darker evenings.
While they were undoubtedly too warm and constricting during the
heatwave, tailored skirt suits are just the ticket for coasting through
the last remnants of an Indian summer into a damp Scottish autumn.
Implicitly smart, they can walk out alone when the days are dry or be
gilded by a raincoat when the weather eventually turns They also work
underneath the season's big camel coats.
The raison d'etre of this season's suits is not of course just to be
neatly convenient underneath outer layers, but marks a vital turning
point in today's dressing, away from grunge into careful grooming last
seen on younger generations in the late fifties and early sixties. These
are not clothes which can be flung on, they will require to be zipped up
in some instances and will invariably need dry cleaning.
Two icons of chic hold the key to this season's suits -- Audrey
Hepburn and Jackie Kennedy . . . before she became Jackie O. Both were
fragile to the eye but strong in character without ever seeming to
chastise -- real ladies in other words.
Clever dressing which does not so much reveal one's assets as make the
most of them is the hallmark of dressing like Audrey and Jackie. In
terms of suits this means efficient tailoring which curves with the
woman, trim on the shoulders, tight to the waist and gracefully cups the
hips without any cheap sashaying.
Jackets have much tighter guidelines, being required to hug the figure
on an hourglass while ending at the hip bone which may draw some eye
lines to unfortunate ripples or rumples on less than taut muscles. The
effect, however, on svelte but womanly curves will be sensational
without straying into tart territory.
Some of the choicest jackets and suits are available from German
labels Verse and Gerry Weber, with the latter providing an array of
colours from light green to yellow, and purple to grey, to take the
wearer through the different shadings of the season, while Verse offers
some really bright alternatives.
Women who want to cut straight to the chase and go for ''knock 'em
dead'' glamour in a classic mode should check out the suits from Clasen,
which were surely never made to go to any ordinary office . . . unless
it is an office straight out of Hollywood Husbands or LA Law.
Berlin-based Clasen delivers high-voltage power suits which don't so
much recall the fragility of Hepburn as the Germanic strength of Marlene
Dietrich.
As in the last couple of seasons, Dietrich savvy is evident in a
number of trouser suits on the market. High fashion demands tight,
straight-leg trousers but the reality of the marketplace is that roomier
trews still dominate, with Planet offering some of the best no-nonsense
trouser suits around.
Another label to check out for suits is Louis Feraud, a design house
which has largely stuck by feminine but serious dressing and knows just
how to gild the lily with the right amount of contrast and trimming for.
Olivier Strelli is a design house which also understands the merit of
suits which can go the distance, with neat waists which work with or
without the belt and a variety of jacket lengths for women who play to
their strengths whatever the season's dictates.
The hottest material for the cold winter, which is bound to punish us
as a payback for the hot summer, is boucle. Boucle is often recalled as
that bubbly wool that tends to characterise clothes in second-hand
shops. As we hit the mid 1990s, however, boucle is generally smoother
and smarter -- this is boucle which reeks of unforced confidence and
dash.
Man-made fabrics certainly wear well these days and can mimic most of
the originals and produce some startling innovations nature could not
begin to replicate. For suits, wool is the word -- even if it isn't wool
in the original instance, but a man-made product. Central to this
season's suits is a lightweight but quality feel and wool is the look.

THERE are people who actually ask whatever became of puffa jackets?
Think about it, why would a fashion item as terminably practical as a
puffa jacket go out of style?
The answer is implicit in the tone of the question, because a lot of
its adherents were women talking across a generation gap at their
teenage daughters.
In terms of high fashion, puffa jackets really only held sway for
something like a half term in the early eighties, and then horrors of
horrors -- the ''mums'' got them. So it is a surprise to find that in
the mid nineties, to wear a puffa jacket is really to get on down . . .
This time around they either have to be bright, bright, bright or
resonantly metallic.
Occasionally puffa jackets can be moody in adolescent black but the
spectrum is largely off the wall -- and uncomplementary to shopping bags
-- in orange, silver and bronze.
The Weekender range from House of Fraser has black, gold, red and pink
for outerwear in which to really pump it up.
A new contender in the sexy suit market, Clasen even has a padded
jacket and matching skirt set, with fur trimming, available in the
juiciest orange for those who share a silhouette with Kate Moss and want
to dabble with curves.
Gerry Weber, a label which usually epitomises sensible good taste has
a padded jacket and gilet set which could stretch beyond the teen years
with aplomb but only on thirty or forty somethings who are decidedly
young at heart. At its best in deep steel, this twosome could go
anywhere and do anything on top of jeans or even pin-striped trousers.
The key is to combine the almost masculine metallic tones of the
modern puffas and gilets with feminine colours such as pink mohair and
shining bright light steel hues.
Combinations which can definitely work together and apart can be found
in the Gil Bret collection, with a gilet so shiny that it has to have
been recently polished. Other metallic possibilities crop up under the
Verse label as sexy gilets and trousers; with the latter thankfully not
padded.
Padded jackets, as opposed to puffa jackets, which have quilting, can
stretch beyond the pelvic bone but generally speaking the styling is
again more young and streetwise than practical or mumsy with fun fur
collars and slap-dash belts with shiny black the preferred colour.
The thing about padding is that it only really works on slim frames or
otherwise one has then has to resort to slimming colours.

KNITWEAR is not really making the running this winter, but big, bold
sweaters still represent a good investment buy.
Smart little twin sets are very much in vogue. For sweaters, flash
your charge card for some beautiful numbers which will go the distance
in your wardrobe for the next couple of years.
Olivier Strelli is a label with some darkly seductive sloppy jumpers
which can be pulled on and look sultry even if it is the morning after
the night before.
Emreco, which is a Glasgow-based knitwear company, has a good slew of
chunky jumpers which look relaxed without descending anywhere near
grunge or grubbiness.
Lucia, which it has to be said is one of the more innovative names in
knitwear, is showcasing a wide variety and choice for weekending women
who want to relax but look good at the same time. Intricate patterns are
being displayed alongside a nice selection with Nordic influence with
sweater, cardigan, gilet and shawl combinations.
Start with a slim knit and then pile on a wool waistcoat and then a
matching cardigan, or go for a matching sweater and skirt (or trousers)
with shawl for top to toe warmth in or out of doors.
Big chunky-necked sweaters with matching sloppy pull-on cardies are
another attractively indulgent possibility being offered for the winter
by the Rodier label.

WHEN glamour and seductive allure are to the fore, legs are invariably
part of the pretty package, either peeping out from long slit skirts or
curving gently from this autumn's trendy knee-line hem or boldly
striding out from under a pelmet.
Well-shaped legs are a bonus whatever but this season they will also
have to be groomed and impeccably turned out as the vogue for
sophisticated real dressing continues. Thankfully the hosiery companies
are turning out some of the best hose ever to grace a glamorous pin.
And getting back to cooler temperatures, tights and stockings will be
welcomed by many women who were caught out by a sticky hot summer and
confined their hose-less wally legs to the glare-free zone of long
skirts. Now that the mercury is at long last plummeting in those
thermometers, the bronzed legs of Greek goddesses are no longer required
and white or pale limbs can skip about in 60 denier uncluttered by
swathes of material.
Sixty denier is of course not the only option available. A variety of
quality sheer tights are on the market to take a leggy lady through from
an Indian summer into winter, particularly alongside the transitional
light wool suits which will be making and appearance or two on our
streets in September and the early days of October.
All the best companies from Elbeo to Pretty Polly and Aristoc are
offering sheer tights in either light or skin-tones which will flatter
the residue of pastel suits and balance nicely with the emerging camel
and chocolate coming through in the middle of the season.
Women who take their fashion seriously will of course eschew tights as
the move towards forties-style tailoring takes hold. But that does not
necessarily mean reverting lock, stock, and suspender to stockings. This
is the nineties after all and we do have mod cons.
The mod con in this instance is the hold-up, which admittedly has not
always held up well in the past. Hose makers are however these days
highlighting the extensive prettiness of the lace-tops which have grown
in size and importance to provide better staying power.
Lace tops to check out or flaunt are cheekily period nylon with Pretty
Polly and decidedly fetching and no pinching with the Italian Phillipe
Matignon label.
Daytime chic is provided by matt hose, but evenings are the time to
rev up the glam pedal and put on a show in the form of some sheen.
Glossies -- of the tight and stocking variety as opposed to the mags --
are big news this season when the sun goes down but how much light and
sparkle you shed on your legs is your choice.
Fatal glamour is a new line of sheen tights from Wolford which will be
available in stores from October. This new introduction follows on from
the unveiling of the seamless fatal line last year, with the format
extended to include special yarns which refract light producing a
lustrous sheen. Colours range from high fashion skin tones and pastels
to darker hues through to black.
Dim is a French label which has made opaque tights sophisticated but
this season it is also introducing a range of ''metallise'' tights in
lighter deniers in which a girl can steel herself for a night on the
tiles in shades of silver, black, gold and white.
Elsewhere night-time does not have to mean a journey into black with a
surfeit of light tights around, enlivened here and there with a
sprinkling of glitter that can be gold or platinum silver for megaton
1950's stardom.
Hue is a name which over the last couple of years has consistently
spelled innovation. This year it not only offers metallics and opaque
lustres but gets ultra wild with snakeskin knee-highs and tights for the
girl who really knows how to curl up in front of the fire.

GOING out into the night with a generous measure of sleekness is the
message for evening wear this season, but there is more than one way to
shine. Two schools of thought permeate the evening wear market -- one
very marked direction is the tuxedo line and the other is the slinky
evening dress tipped with the sparkle of sequins in which to hit them
midships. Either way the mood has to be sensual and sultry rather than
light and frothy.
Tuxedoes have been an empowering trend for working women socialising
on a network level, adding the spice of a woman challenging the status
quo in what has traditionally been perceived as male wear with the added
conundrum of the undeniably sexual appeal of a woman in men's clothing.
What they do not have to be, are trouser suits. The pioneering has
been done and now the tuxedo sector has opened up to include
satin-collared jackets which can trip the light fantastic along with
crepe skirts and seductive bodies.
From a man-style suit, the idea of the tuxedo has been expanded to
include more decidedly feminine variations and this has also allowed the
development of the evening wear market into separates which accord
better with a career woman's sensibilities and tend to have a longer
life in the limelight since separates can be mixed and matched to ring
the changes.
For separates read a wide range of night-time slants on daytime
staples from the well-established palazzo pants to leggings, A-line
skirts, and shift dresses. All of the above have this season been
drafted into the evening wear market but packaged in glamorous materials
such satin, silk, and velvet to pack a punch in luxury terms.
Again taking the cue from the tuxedo, the emphasis is on wearable
clothes which are more about how modern women perceive themselves than
garb for male accompaniments. These clothes put forward a womanly
perspective of sexy and attractive . . . without being diminutive.
Not that these garments are plain or unadorned. Women also know the
power of details, which can be played up to their full potential in
evening wear separates, with such variations as necklines picked out
with beading, scalloped edges, slit pleats and sequin additions.
All of which have also led on to the new idea of the two-piece evening
dress with a precise silhouette that is tailored yet soft; the implicit
hardness of glamour with a feminine touch. Glamour is the overt message
but it is glamour over which women have the control.
Jackets are very much to the fore either in tuxedo form or bolero over
skirt sets or cocktail shift dresses for studied elegance. Louis Feraud
backs the return of glamour with a selection of sequinned dresses
matched with nifty bolero jackets while its range of brocade print
jackets are worn with either satin or velvet skirts. Trimmings such as
beads, seed pearls, ribbon edgings and furs provide dramatic allure.
The Louis Feraud Set takes inspiration from the tuxedo with a new
twist for its cocktail creations, such as soft shouldered jackets with
satin lapels to go with narrow pants for a less rigid turn on an
established favourite, while strappy dresses have short, sharp jackets
for added sass.
Escada Couture is a new name to play with taking this label to fresh
heights of glamour which, it has to be said, still fully acknowledge
that the woman is in the driving seat while sticking some changes of
Hollywood gear.
Most definitely for the high maintenance woman however, variations it
is offering this season include Shimmering Nights with sequins and jet,
suspended on sheer silk georgette and Shooting Stars with rhinestones
scattered on taut tank dresses with tiny little boleros.
Sometimes only a full-blown dress will do for that glittering
occasion. Shimmer and lustre also hold sway on the Vera Mont label which
this year has gone for both long slimline shapes and flowing dresses in
rich velvet, crepe, and chiffon. Luminosity is provided by contrasting
panels of duchesse satin, lurex and lame.

ANIMAL prints and fake fur are not exactly an innovation but it is
interesting to note the times when they come around and are accorded
acceptability. Certainly the heyday of animal prints always seems to
coincide with moves by designers to steer women towards tailored
clothes.
What are they giving us? A chance to project animal magnetism and wild
abandon within the confines of sharply tailored lines? Then again, furs
go hand in glove with the days of tight suits and zipped dresses when
chic females were seen as cosseted little women.
It is to be hoped that the psychology this time around is to let women
have a little fun and be a touch wild. There is more than a glint of
Marianne Faithful running with the Rolling Stones in the sixties in the
emphasis being given to the leopard spots and cheetah prints for autumn
1995, while marabou edging on knits places the wearer firmly in the days
of the baby boom generation.
A classic little suit of our times was knitted to be wild by Fenn
Wright &amp; Manson with a fake fur collar and a silk A-line animal print
skirt which is decidedly swinging sixties.
Betty Barclay lets rip this season with a highly fashionable offshoot
collection called Secret Agent Girl, for women who can outgun 007 and
whose tailoring and good taste is their bond. Smart but intrinsically
fun, this collection includes some of the sassiest animal prints around
on tight short skirts in striking black and white, for girls who don't
want any grey in their lives. Perspective and greater wearability is
delivered with black jackets which only go to the edge with matching
animal print on the collars.
More subtle wild women should consider the Marc Cain collection, which
is relatively new to Scotland. Amid a collection which delivers
brilliant brights and working greys on this season's natty suits, it
also has some untamed dresses and jackets in primeval dark fake fur,
with which the wearer can inject some life into more standard shift
dresses or suits.
With black on black, these prints can live either in the daytime or at
night with the ease of a slinking panther, taking the wearer for a walk
on the wild side without requiring a whole-hog safari into the jungle.
A sophisticated take on animal magic is delivered by Louis Feraud,
which this season has the essential chic three-piece suit for maximum
clawing power. Comprising a three-quarter length A-line jacket trimmed
with leopard print cuffs and pockets, this suit goes with a totally
leopard print wool mix skirt and silk blouse.
You can, however, feel wild without going out looking like an animal?
The re-emergence of fake fur may be too heady for many, but an easy and
inexpensive way to run with the pack is to add accessories in animal or
snake print. Bags, hats and even gloves are all available in ''beastly''
forms but the simplest addition could be a leopard or snake print scarf
to imply understanding of the season's essential mores without going the
whole hog.

AUTUMN is the season of all seasons, when a week can include anything
from a summer day to the coldest of afternoons. Its changeability can
make steering a sartorial course difficult when rain and shine compete
for dominance often within the same half hour.
Pastel hues and white are de rigueur for the emerging sixties look.
Cotton tops in pastel hues can also help ring the changes without any
loss of face or tanned advantage. It is more than acceptable this season
to wear traditional autumnal clothing enlivened up by light summer
colouring around the face. Tones which will do the business include icy
pinks and mint greens as well as the odd splash of yellow.
September is usually the month for packing our summer gear away and
bringing out the heavy duty wear, but thankfully a few items can stay
out of the trunk for a month or so without looking completely passe.
A little belt will provide an amazing amount of additional mileage for
fitted floral dresses though an A-line roped in with a belt may threaten
to look more 1950's teenager than sophisticated siren. Another essential
little extra is the short cardie which ends at the waist.
The long floral satin skirt is one for the trunk, but its shorter
sister can easily come out to play. The cue is again to recall the
forties by topping it with a woollen twin set and then use some
colourist nous to link it to the floral theme. Sweet pink jumpers are
honeys over black satin skirts printed with roses. But always remember
the essential slim belt for that vital waisted appeal.
Though it is officially dead and buried, the legacy of grunge is the
acceptable mixing of different weight fabrics, which means frothy
knee-length skirts can do another turn in the company of the chunkiest
of knits as the weather turns cooler.
Close knit bodies with high necks and long sleeves will earn their
money thrice over this season with the emergence of the shift dress and
jacket suit. Such bodies can obviously go out on their own upfront with
a standard skirt or trouser suit but they will be a vital extra when it
comes to allowing shift-struck women to wear these dresses as November
and December take hold.
Sports-inspired gear offers the best and laziest options for weekends
of uncertain weather, with an initial lycra layer close to the chest and
then baggy oversweats. Tight sports clothing still gets the nod at clubs
and some of the most ladylike labels around, such as Escada, now have
sports ranges making this kind of gear more than acceptable.

A SHORTHAND staple which will instantly revitalise any dowdy old skirt
or trouser suit is the blue satin shirt.
It can be no coincidence that some of the top fashion magazines have
featured the shiny blue shirt on their front covers. This is a shirt,
which in fashion parlance, has legs and will be the one to wear.
Satin or otherwise, it is essential that the shirt is dark blue but
lustrous and has the crucial pointed collars.

HIGH-octane lingerie which has to be seen to believed -- and
frequently will be -- is being offered this season.
Amid classic collections of respectable allure, the top design houses
are also trailblazing with what have to be some of the most brazenly fun
pieces this side of Jezebel's heyday . . .
Then there are the completely see-through items, which lingerie houses
openly admit are truely chatelaine.
Valisere this year presents its first seamless cup bra, Vincennes, in
semi-transparent, feather-light crepe trimmed with Swiss guipere, but in
complete contrast it also has the pre-formed cups of the Gambetta bra
and body.
Charnos is a label which talks about ''underwear as outerwear for
vampish versatility'' in its press release for autumn/winter 1995, which
is a fair indication of where most of its range is coming from.
Even its Arcadia range, which is lingerie designed along sporty lines
for underwear which moves with the wearer, is described as ''ultra
sensuous'' and it is, using a shimmering Tactel fabric which gives
sporty shapes a forties-style femininity.
This year Gossard introduces a startlingly simple idea -- the
cami-bra. Essentially this garment has the cut-across chestline of a
camisole with bra seaming for support round the sides, effectively
replacing two garments with one, which is altogether more practical and
comfortable.
Elsewhere, interesting colours have been conjured up by Lovable and
include chestnut and rose for its delicate Gemme-Ambra range and its
special Giada range, aimed at the Christmas gift market, which is
available in sultry hues of blue, ivory and jade.
Ballet this season introduces its Jewel range which heightens its
Hollywood style allure by working two sexy shades alongside each other.
Its silver/black colourway is particularly effective in recalling the
silver screen.
Bodies have long crossed over from underwear into an essential
component part of most working women's outerwear wardrobes but a new
move by Wolford this winter will throw the role of bodies -- the
garments that is -- back into confusion.
A good selection of its bodies are wholeheartedly sturdy outerwear
which will do a good job, keeping the wearer in check under business
suits and with jeans.
But the Wolford range also includes some cutting-edge transparent
numbers -- with matching hose -- which have the panache required for
outerwear but may be just a tad too see-through for women who don't want
to reveal all outside the boudoir.

GIVEN that the pen is mightier than the sword, the way this season to
be decidedly deadlier than the ''mail'' is to wear pillar box red and
underwrite your visual pulling power.
Incontrovertibly this season's hottest colour is red -- a no-punches
pulled red which will sock any viewer in the eye. A very shocking
contrast to the neat lines of this season's tailored skirts and jackets,
this kind of red surprisingly works best on suits -- where it turns up
the volume on demure tailoring.
Great blocks of red across matching skirts and jackets are the route
to take for women who want to blast their way through the office
politics and take no prisoners in their wake.
But thankfully it is not all about being red or dead. One screaming
red suit should be in every wardrobe, but the real standby staple of the
season is the good old tartan or plaid jacket, which to be at its most
effective should include a touch of blood to remind the red coats of the
250th anniversary of Culloden.
Tartan cannot however just be romantically inclined to be a hit this
season. To be in vogue, tartan jackets -- whatever the clan -- still
have to follow the season's tight tailoring with neat waists.
Betty Barclay and Mondi -- names which originate in Germany -- have
some of the best tartan jackets and other bits and bobs, including the
essential mini kilt, for autumn 1995.

MEN'S suits this season are a hard-working amalgam of two distinct
styles, which may well have been seen as incompatible in previous years.
After all how could a distinguished English gentleman possibly
associate with an Italian-influenced Mod? It may have taken the
sartorial equivalent of the melting furnace -- going back to the drawing
board -- to do it, but that is obviously what this season's designers
have done.
The result is a season of suits which are impeccably English and
delectably rakish and will need grace and a galley-load of good grooming
to carry them off.
The essential emphasis is on a straight lean body with two-piece suits
doing the business without any recourse to a waistcoat, coordinating or
otherwise.
The English influence means that these suits do not then descend into
parody, with the proportions kept sensible and unobtrusive. Shoulders
are stout but not in the Sylvester Stallone mode; trousers are straight
but not calf or thigh hugging while never getting overblown or
billowing.
This may sound like the suits the ''suits'' have been wearing for the
last couple of years, but this time round the influence is certain to be
wider spread, cutting into the territory of casual man in unstructured
outfits in areas more usually associated with freer styles such as the
arts. Suits this autumn are a style statement rather than a uniform for
the boardroom.
The styling of the suits will undoubtedly recall the sixties for many
but the colours are anything but psychedelic with standard black,
browns, and dark blues the backbone of the choice available. A slim and
youthful outline is offered but this is a very straight-edged look.
When suits become a shade lighter in tone they tend to be tweed but
like the women's sector this is not the tweed of the country but the
city with subtle striping and herringbone emphasising the English gent
effect. The colouring is, of course, gently grey.
This being Britain -- and Scotland in particular, rain and overcoats
are part of the package. Indisputably wool overcoats are in, straight
from the sixties and straight in line, while raincoats are
quintessentially Anglo and masculine, meant to be worn loose rather than
tightly belted.
Smartly pressed shirts are de rigueur but again we are talking nothing
loose, but the slightly tailored shirts which run alongside the body and
moulded collars provide the right straight edging.
Where men can afford to lighten up is with their ties, which have been
reserved as an area for Mediterranean flair and fancy. Brighter colours
which can sit well against navy and black shirt and suit combinations
strike a blow for liberty and the rights of the individual. Just about
everything is up for grabs though the pairing will have to be done with
flair and style. Ties provide an opportunity to lighten up the overall
effect but they should not drown the inherent English gent within this
season's suits.
Men's casualwear is also sharpening up this winter with the emphasis
less on the sporty, big, and baggy and more on refined textures and
softer fabrics.
The new accent is on clothes which are comfortable and easy to wear
but essentially neat and tidy and certainly not hanging out.
Sportswear generally gets short shrift with lycra and sweat materials
losing sheen away from the gym or the football park. Even golf
references are this season looking stylistically under par for the man
of the moment.
Nor does it remain acceptable to go for the wild man of the mountains
look; this season the note to hit at the pub or the country hotel is not
Iron John but urbane man taking time out from any rigorous activity.
These are clothes in which to walk and talk, but not necessarily
conquer mountains or run with the deer. But at the same time, these
clothes have the energy for daily life and do not look like unmade beds.
Overcoats are functional in muted forest tones but they no longer
belong lock, stock and barrel with the huntin', shootin' and fishing
fraternity or with those who want to appear so, while knits are simple
in earthy or no-nonsense tweed tones made to be pulled over a hidden
T-shirt but not part of an assembly of ever-emerging layers.
In effect, what is happening is a simplification of garments and a
pull-back from the overdressed or all-action look without cultivating a
totally lived-in look.
Simple, understated casual clothes are the way forward for the season
with less emphasis on flash dressing up or snazzy waistcoats, or for
that matter crumpled cottons.
Plaid shirts are with us forever, it seems, when it comes to the
casual sector, but again this season they have been refined and are no
longer from lumberjack country but are often smaller and more discreet
checks in finer materials.
The Classic range from Mudie is a diverse selection of separates with
a large range of fabrics and yarns in earthy neutral colours cleverly
blended with Oxford stripes and jacquard designs for a more
sophisticated take on country shirts.
Double Two this winter is introducing a small amount of wool into its
shirt styles to give a warm handle to plaids and checks in seasonally
correct shades. In addition, the Double Two collection also offers a
herringbone design in soft tones for the cold winter nights has
introduced baby cord in shades of wine, cream, navy, chocolate and olive
for added warmth and comfort.

THE day when any mother watches her daughter glide elegantly down the
aisle and into the arms of her husband is a day to remember.
Mother-of the bride outfits have always been important, but now that
the video age is in full swing with a cameraman as much part of the
proceedings as the ordinary wedding photographer, outfits for the mother
of the bride, groom. . . and all the other guests, are chosen even more
carefully. It's not only the wedding album that capture them for
posterity -- it's a living, moving videotape which can, and probably
will be, played on numerous occasions.
With the relaxation in dress code for the bride and groom and the rest
of the wedding party, mothers can also feel more comfortable if they
choose to go out on a limb from the usual type of dress or skirt suit.
It's fair to say that some outfits which suit the big day, have as
much use afterwards as daughter's floaty fairytale number.
Practical mothers will go for something classic which can be dressed
up with the obligatory hat and perhas gloves for the wedding, but worn
comfortably afterwards.
Autumn and winter weddings don't have to mean thick woollen outfits
for warmth as mothers will spend most of their time outdoors in the
comfort of a chauffeur-driven limousine.
Something more substantial than light summer fabrics will be needed,
and mothers who shudder at the thought of wearing pastels will be happy
to choose from richer colours in the winter ranges.
The choice of what to wear is almost overwhelming. There are skirt
suits, with skirts of all lengths -- the Jackie Kennedy look so
prevalent at the moment will suit most ages, although older mothers will
probably comment that they remember having things like that in their
wardobes ''first time round''.
Suits composed of a dress and jackets can be even more graceful, with
the added bonus of being able to forgo the worry of the right top.
Mothers who prefer trousers can also find suits of all styles and
colours to blend in with the occasion.
For traditionalists, there are time-honoured mother of the bride
outfits to be found in most collections. Plain colours are usually most
flattering, and easier to find accessories for, but there's no harm in
venturing into a colourful tartan or a plain colour teamed with black
for emphasis. Everyone knows -- the idea is to shine without taking the
spotlight away from the bride.
Those as a first-time mother of the bride should remember an important
part of any outfit -- somewhere to keep the all-important tissue.

Home Affairs Correspondent James Freeman asks whether the television
appeal by relatives in murder cases is becoming too exploitative
TELEVISION still has the capacity to shock us, whether it is with
images of famine victims, the shattered bodies of ordinary Sarajevo folk
hit by a mortar round -- or, just as topical, the distraught relatives
of a young murder victim appealing for information.
Despite the modern syndrome of compassion fatigue, few of us fail to
be moved when a youngster like 15-year-old Emma Jones looks out at us
from the screen and describes how she found the mutilated body of her
best pal, Naomi Smith. A potent message comes across which, hopefully,
will help bring the killer to justice that much more quickly.
It is little different when the son of the Inverurie social club
murder victim broadcast last night, the major difference being that he
pleaded for his father's killer to give himself up, which is unlikely to
happen.
The idea is the same, however: that those suffering perhaps a conflict
of loyalties will be swayed by the obvious image of suffering and will
either turn the killer in or supply vital information which helps the
jigsaw pieces fall into place.
The appearance of emotional relatives has, however, now become
more-or-less an everyday occurrence, giving rise to at least some
disquiet that detectives now see such media appearances as a convenient
shortcut or that television has become a substitute for the real thing.
Has the whole idea become too exploitative?
The reality is that while the exact origins of the high-profile
appearance of relatives is lost in the mists of television mythology, it
was very probably not the detectives who first thought it. The received
knowledge is that they merely responded to pressure from the media and,
principally, from the insatiable maw of television which requires
round-the-clock sensation to fill the yawning hours of air time.
There is another aspect which should not be dismissed and that is that
very often the relatives of the murder victim, while clearly traumatised
and grief stricken, are as often as not eager to assist in bringing the
killer, or rapist, or child abductor to book.
The National Association of Victim Support Schemes reflects this when
it points out that it responds to the needs of victims and some -- it
does not know exactly how many -- are keen to enlist media help.
''We try as best we can to reduce the trauma to relatives of victims.
Our policy is not to tell people what to do but we can help them to make
an informed choice. We give them as much practical help as possible,''
the spokesman adds.
The police are largely unrepentant about the use of victims' relatives
in murder hunts and it is difficult to fault their logic. One senior
detective with a long record of tackling intractable cases in Glasgow's
toughest areas said really effective policing was only possible with the
wholehearted support of the communities affected. The use of television
is, in these terms, just an extension of the appeal for witnesses in the
local paper of 20 years ago.
Detectives tracing a murderer still use the more conventional means,
of course, such as door-to-door inquiries, and these still account for
much information. That intelligence, often low-level, often anonymous,
is vital in piecing together the movements of key players, and once the
field has been narrowed down some of the other techniques may then turn
up trumps.
Recent advances have meant, for example, that the automatic
fingerprint recognition system installed at the Scottish Criminal
Records Office increasingly comes up with ''cold hits'' -- unknown
prints left at a crime scene matching those left at another crime scene
where there is a possible suspect.
One force in the South of England is pioneering a data bank of 30,000
prints of shoes of different types and manufacture to narrow the field
down quickly when a shoe print is found at a crime scene. The English
DNA data bank which holds ''genetic fingerprints'' of known criminals
recently came up with its first random match. Practically the only brake
on the perfecting and wider application of such swiftly advancing
forensic technology is the reluctance of government to resource costly
programmes.
These tools can only come into play when there is a suspect in the
frame and the major problem facing detectives these days is the
reluctance of people, particularly in high-crime housing areas, to stand
up in the witness box and say what they have seen or what they know.
The police, particularly in Strathclyde, are tackling that problem
head on. Only last week the chief constable, Leslie Sharp, placed
Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, on the spot on this issue
during his Paisley visit, eliciting a very public pledge from Forsyth
that he would raise the issue with the Lord Advocate.
One suspects he can raise witness protection until he is blue in the
face but the Lord Advocate's dusty answer will be something along the
lines that it is everyone's public duty to give evidence regardless of
intimidation, real or imagined.
Professor Steve Bruce, the Aberdeen University sociologist, agrees
that ''information received is still the main way of pointing the police
towards the likely suspect'', so that the television appeal is a
legitimate tool. He agrees that it can bring a sense of purpose and
usefulness to traumatised relatives at a time of maximum stress.
In Scottish terms, there is no argument that the media's fight for
market share has played a part in making the up-front television appeal
a common occurrence.

Geoffrey Parkhouse examines the possible Labour/Liberal Democrat
concoctions that could make the next General Election go with a swing
for Blair and Ashdown.
PICTURE a scene in Tony Blair's office at the Commons in about a
month's time. Whiskies poured, Blair and Paddy Ashdown begin to talk
about how they might combine their efforts to get the Tories out. At
once they hit a problem -- the most important policy question of all,
the timing of the next General Election.
If the two leaders are really talking seriously they will address the
next big problem with co-operation. Ashdown's party needs proportional
representation voting reform to give it substantial political clout.
Blair is not that keen on abandoning first-past-the-post to decide the
government of the country.
He is committed by his predecessor, John Smith, to hold a referendum
on the issue. Ashdown will want to know who is going to write the
question for the referendum and what it is going to say.
The Liberal Democrats are acutely conscious that any government can
pose a referendum question to get the answer it wants. Ashdown is
already appalled that Blair's commitment to devolution will not now
extend to England. If there is any meaning to Labour and Lib-Dem
co-operation the question posed for the PR referendum is vital.
About this time next month, when the party conference hype is out of
the way for both Blair and Ashdown, would be the earliest that the two
men might have a get-together.
Blair's Shadow Cabinet decided yesterday that they would start to
detail Labour policy at their conference in Brighton next month. They
will need to float a few details to see how they go before the November
28 Budget when the lines of battle for the next General Election are
likely to be drawn.
Over the past three years in particular the Labour Party and the
Liberal Democrats have between them taken over local government in
Britain and learned on the ground to run councils to the exclusion of
the Tories. But there is no sign that Blair and Ashdown are ready to
enter into a General Election pact -- neither of their parties would
stand for it.
For one thing, the Labour Party thinks it's going to win anyway, and
for another, Ashdown has only 24 MPs, although he boasts that this is
the most powerful third party representation in the Commons for decades.
Ashdown has declared that he could not work with another Tory
Government and that the old policy of ''equidistance'' between the two
major parties is dead. Blair mischievously applauds this on the eve of
the Liberal Democrat annual conference in Glasgow. It does him no harm
to do so, but it causes, as usual, a frisson in the Liberal Democratic
Party which is in two minds about how to get a stake in power.
Actual policy evolution in the Labour Party has brought the two
together more closely. Blair's New Labour is very close to the policies
of the now defunct Social Democratic Party on defence, Europe, and the
re-establishment of trade union recognition. They are very close on what
the old SDP used to call the ''social market partnership'' and
unwillingness to renationalise basic industry.
Party democracy -- one member, one vote -- is more or less in place
and Labour and the Lib Dems agree on the Bill of Rights, a freedom of
information Act.
For the old SDP founders like Shirley Williams, Labour and the Lib
Dems are perhaps a trifle too close in general policy. Lady Williams
found it necessary to state yesterday that the Lib Dems are not up for
grabs. Constitutional reform still leaves the two parties apart. Ashdown
and his followers want devolution in England as well as Scotland and
Wales. They want an elected Second Chamber, whereas Blair is talking
only of abolishing the voting rights of hereditary peers.
The bald fact is that, despite what Blair and Ashdown might want to
concoct together, their parties may be closer to the reality. There can
be no shake-down deals until the electorate has declared its view on
General Election day. This does not stop Blair and Ashdown meeting to
talk, and their first opportunity would be mid-October when the Commons
returns for the final sittings of this session of Parliament.
By then Ashdown will have absorbed the policy utterances at the Labour
Party conference.
There is a lot that should attract both Labour and Liberal Democrat
policy makers in an honest approach to the electorate. But the old devil
of party politics always intervenes.
What is in it for devout Liberals or the rump of the SDP if their
electioneering efforts are only to ensure a Labour government without
them having a stake in it?
Already, yesterday, the Tory Party was making trouble for Blair and
Ashdown, with the party chairman, Dr Brian Mawhinney, claiming that both
Blair and Ashdown are already talking about a hung Parliament next time.
In short, any talk of Labour/Liberal-Democrat co-operation is exploited
as defeatism by the Tories. Underlying this is a similar view taken
particularly in the Labour Party at this stage in the political cycle.
We return to the two items that really count. The Prime Minister has
geared up for an election in 1997 -- or so he says. It must suit Blair
to try to force him to the polls before that -- next spring, or next
autumn. What timing suits Ashdown, who has declared that his number one
priority is to get the Tories out?
Can the two of them devise a tactical deal, perhaps involving the
Ulster Unionists and their new leader David Trimble, to force Major into
an earlier General Election. Would Ashdown abandon the holy grail of the
Liberal Democrats -- PR voting -- to do so? It is unlikely that the
putative Prime Minister Blair would concede to Ashdown the posing of
that PR referendum question.
By next March, with these constraints on co-operation in mind, it
could turn out to be every party for itself in a General Election again.

INTERNATIONAL shinty player Gordon MacIntyre yesterday refused to give
up the game, despite a horrific eye injury.
Although the Oban Camanachd defender concedes his playing career is
over, he plans to move into refereeing and coaching, even though he has
lost the sight in his left eye.
He was struck in the face at point blank range by the ball during last
Saturday's match at Kingussie.
Surgeons at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness were unable to save his eye
and he was yesterday recovering from the operation and coming to terms
with having to finish playing the game he loves.
One of his first visitors was Michael Clark, the Kingussie player who
struck the ball in Mr MacIntyre's face, and was deeply upset at the
outcome.
''It was a complete accident. I have no hard feelings towards him at
all, it is all part of the game,'' said the injured player.
But the 29-year-old admitted that the injury would now prevent him
playing at the highest level.
With his wife, Sharon, at his bedside, he said: ''I could carry on
playing if I wore a protective faceguard, but that would be more
frustrating than anything. You have got to meet a standard. If you can't
meet that, there is no point playing.''
But such is his love for shinty, Mr MacIntyre has vowed to continue
being involved in the game, either through coaching or refereeing. ''It
is too much a part of my life to let it go,'' he said.
He began playing at the age of 14, and had established himself as one
of the top players in Scotland. He was due to play for Scotland against
Ireland at Fort William on September 30.
An electronics engineer, Mr MacIntyre was so committed to the game he
had been commuting from Londonderry in Northern Ireland to play each
week for his home town.
He even decided to change jobs so he could be closer to home, and is
due to begin work in Livingston next Monday.
Mr MacIntyre expects to leave hospital on Friday.
Shinty has been one of Scotland's fastest growing sports, and head and
hand injuries among players have soared in recent years.
Medical experts were so worried about the trend that they commissioned
a special survey.
Although it is not clear if a headguard would have prevented Mr
MacIntyre's injury, detailed research has shown that injuries to players
are more frequent and severe than in any other sport.

DENTISTS who launched their own private dental care scheme in the
Highlands two years ago now hope other Scottish dentists will form
similar schemes in an effort to provide low cost treatment for patients
in the face of proposed NHS cuts.
Yesterday in Glasgow, directors of the Highland Dental Care Plan
described the success of the Highland scheme, which includes 58 of the
region's 63 dentists and has more than 7000 patient subscribers.
They warned of further Government plans to cut NHS treatments -- such
as crowns on back teeth and bridge work -- and said their scheme was the
only way forward for dentists who found themselves increasingly
frustrated with such cuts and crippled by escalating materials costs.
At a meeting with dental practitioners from across Scotland at the
weekend, the Highland dentists announced the formation of IndepenDent
Care Plans UK, which will offer other groups of dentists back-up and
advice. The organisation also intends to meet with English and Welsh
dentists later this year.
Within Highland region the plan offers patients a preventive care
scheme at a cost of around #10 a month and an annual insurance premium
of #7.33 to cover emergency treatment anywhere in the UK. In addition,
patients are also charged dental laboratory costs.
One of the plan's directors, Mr John Jamieson, acknowledged the scheme
had come in for criticism but said the alternative for patients was
expensive private dental care or, in Highland region, up to nine month
long waiting lists for those seeking NHS treatment from Highland Health
Board's eight salaried general dental practioners.
However, a Highland Health Board spokesman blamed long waiting times
on the decision by the region's dentists to cease taking on new NHS
patients.
He added that the board had made a commitment to reducing waiting
lists to eight weeks by the end of the year, and he refuted the
suggestion that NHS dentistry was cheap, hole in the wall dentistry.
However, the IndepenDent Care Plan move was welcomed by the British
Dental Association's Scottish secretary, Mr Alistair MacLean, who said
the advantage of the scheme was that it was run by dentists and was
non-profit making.

A PLAQUE was unveiled by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday
to mark the #12m regeneration of a housing scheme.
It officially marked completion of the final phase of redevelopment at
Dundee's Mid Craigie estate, a change which, he admitted, was beyond
what he thought was possible.
The project, providing 255 new two and three bedroom homes for sale,
has won awards from the National House Building Council. It is jointly
funded by Wimpey Homes, Dundee District Council, and Scottish Homes
housing agency.
Mr Forsyth toured the development, speaking to local people. ''There
is a spirit of discovery in Dundee and a willingness to embrace change
rather than stand against it,'' he said.
''We will attract investment to Dundee by showing them the success of
housing developments of this kind. Frankly, not even I, who have been
arguing for these things for years, would have been persuaded that it
was possible to produce such a transformation as I have seen here.''
Scottish Homes chairman Sir James Mellon said it was an excellent
example of ''what we are trying to achieve: the development of
self-sustaining communities in the urban environment.''

DOUNREAY will not face prosecution for discharging nitric acid into
the Pentland Firth after Highland River Purification Board yesterday
cleared it of damaging marine life.
The Herald revealed in February the nuclear facility had been making
daily discharges through a radioactive outfall for a decade, in
contravention of the Control of Pollution Act which carries a maximum
penalty of a #20,000 fine and three months in prison.
The board has no power over radioactive emissions, that being the
remit of HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate, and in this case had been
concerned about acid in the discharges.
It did not know of the acid until 1993. Its annual report carried the
only public mention of the acid and said the Atomic Energy Authority was
told it must neutralise the acid or a report would go to the
procurator-fiscal.
It emerged it would take Dounreay nearly four years before it could
neutralise the acid. HRPB's director, Mr Duncan Buchanan, was not happy
with this time-scale and said he was preparing a report for the
procurator-fiscal.
Yesterday, however, the HRPB gave Dounreay a clean bill of health on
the discharges. Mr Buchanan was on holiday but a statement was issued
saying he had consulted the fiscal in March.
''Following advice from the procurator-fiscal the board appointed
private consultants, Environment and Resource Technology Ltd, to carry
out a survey into the impact of the acid effluent on marine life in the
vicinity of the plant's 'low radioactive' outfall pipe. The survey was
successfully completed in August this year,'' it said.
''The results of the marine survey and associated laboratory tests
have confirmed that there is adequate dilution and rapid neutralisation
of the acid provided by the outfall diffusers and effective mixing with
the salt water as the buoyant effluent plume floats up to the surface.
''No significant acidity was detected by the consultants at the
surface or a depth close to the outfall pipe. The results of the survey
work indicate clearly that there is no significant damage done to marine
life from the discharge of acid in the effluent from the plant and
therefore no breach of the board's discharge consents.
''As there was no evidence that an offence under the Control of
Pollution Act 1974 had been committed, the procurator-fiscal has
confirmed that he does not intend to initiate legal proceedings against
the UKAEA in this case.''
Mr Ian Shepherd, UKAEA spokesman at Dounreay, welcomed the report
saying it vindicated the plant's activities.
However, Mr John Martin, the Highland Green Party's nuclear spokesman,
condemned the announcement as a ''whitewash''.

ALF YOUNG seems a little confused about the difference between
pressure groups and political parties (Jaded ethics of the Greens,
September 15).
He says he has not signed up as a Friend of the Earth or Greenpeace
supporter ''partly because . . . journalists owe it to their readers not
to carry any party card''. As far as I am aware neither of these
organisations is a political party.
It may interest Alf Young and your readers to know that the Scottish
Green Party developed from the UK Green Party which itself was
originally called the People Party. The environmental emphasis grew with
the realisation (at which some parties have yet to arrive) that an
ailing environment cannot support a healthy thriving population or a
healthy thriving economy.
Green politics (as opposed to green pressure activities) is about
addressing social and environmental problems in a commonsense manner. To
that end the Scottish Green Party has radical proposals to alter the tax
system from taxing work, as at present, to taxing resource use; to
replace the present cumbersome and divisive benefits system by a basic
income scheme; to replace local taxation which penalises development by
land value taxation which encourages proper use of land, to name but a
few.
Our concerns and those of pressure groups may coincide at times but
are not identical because as a political party we have a complete
manifesto not just a set of environmental policies.
On the issue of the Greens ''losing support'', I should point out that
across Europe Greens have enjoyed great electoral success at all levels
of government, and the Green group is the fourth largest in the European
Parliament.
In Scotland our membership is rising faster now than at any time since
our best electoral showing of 1989.
The issues are still there, and so are we.

I NOTE with interest that in your leader column (September 18) you
identify the Liberal Democrat commitment to raise income tax by 1%, if
necessary, to provide better education as the best-known Liberal
Democrat policy. You also suggest that the party does not have a
revulsion for higher taxes for a good cause and that this may apply to
the National Health Service.
You are indeed right to say that that we are committed to defending
Britain's public services. We do not like high taxes but we recognise
that quality public services need proper funding. This may require
higher tax or may be obtained from other sources.
However, we also recognise that we have to set priorities and that we
need to seek imaginative solutions. We cannot raise income tax to
provide new funds for all government departments.
This week the Liberal Democrats will discuss a proposal for the
earmarking of increases in tobacco tax to the NHS. It is a policy I
wholeheartedly support. It is not only an effective preventative measure
-- the success of which can be seen in Canada and Australia -- but it
will also provide valuable resources for an underfunded NHS.
A 5p increase in tobacco tax would pay for our commitment to free eye
and dental checks alone, a policy you will be hard-pressed to find in
Labour or Conservative documents. This would be the first stage of our
defence of the NHS.

THE article headed ''Euro MP in drink health warning'' (September 15)
contained some interesting comments from Dr Rae of the Portman Group.
First, Dr Rae does not disclose the fact that the Portman Group, his
employer, is financed by the eight largest breweries and distilleries in
the UK. I suspect there might be some self-interest in trying to play
down my attempts at labelling alcohol containers.
Secondly, Dr Rae indicated it is premature to look at the question of
labelling as there is little research into the topic. He ignores the
fact that labelling is the norm in the USA and Canada and extensive
research into this issue has confirmed the benefits of labelling.
Dr Rae further states that 70% of alcohol consumed will be in glasses,
therefore a warning label is ineffective. While this is true, the
''designer drinks'' promoted by the industry and consumed by younger
people tend to be drunk from the bottle. The important point it that all
alcohol would be required to carry a warning. This is the issue worrying
the alcohol industry.
Dr Rae, I believe, is being somewhat economical with the truth. While
it may be true that the distillers/brewers spend #2m a year on health
education, they spend #200m on advertising their products. A bit of an
imbalance, don't you think?

I'M very perturbed about the campaign now being operated against
Temazepam. If one only reads the headlines and lurid stories about the
addiction, it would appear that the villain of the piece is Temazepam,
instead of it being those who misuse it.
I've not read or heard one word of praise for the help it has been to
thousands of users, like myself. I had one problem -- my sleep pattern
was atrocious.
I'd be pleasantly tired, fall asleep almost at once, and waken about
3.30am, absolutely wide awake and quite unable to get back to sleep. I
don't catnap during the day to compensate.
On mentioning this to our caring and diligent doctor, he prescribed
one 10mg Temazepam at night, and from the very first tablet I've slept
right through till about 7am with no drowsiness during the day and no
side effects. So far as I'm concerned, the benefit has been tremendous.
It now seems to me that the usual old horror story is, once again, in
full cry. I can think of many substances once available and now banned,
not because of their danger but because some indulgent careless fool
misuses them and raises the hazard which would not apply if used
properly.
The majority suffer because of the carelessness of the minority!

WE have just seen the end of a trial involving Nuclear Power and the
Nuclear Inspectorate. The judge said that he was awarding an exemplary
punishment and fined Nuclear Power #250,000.
Nuclear Power is a publicly owned company and any profit goes to the
Treasury. Likewise any operating losses are made good by the Treasury. I
understand the fines are also paid by the Treasury. Thus any shortfall
in profit is made good by the fine. Clearly you cannot withhold funding
from Nuclear Power for that may jeopardise safety.
Now both parties to this dispute are owned by the taxpayer and yet all
the taxpayer sees is a net outflow of his funds to lawyers. All the rest
is just book-keeping. At least that is how I see it and that view is
shared by those with whom I have discussed it.
I think we are owed an explanation why this is considered exemplary
punishment. If I were found guilty of an offence and the punishment was
to take money from my account and put it into my wife's, I would laugh
all the way to the bank.

JAMES Freeman had a fairly lengthy telephone conversation with me a
few days before his article, A wave of acrimony (September 11), and I am
surprised he did not refer to any of the points I made, for example, our
support of a compulsory boat driving test, which is not included in the
proposed by-laws.
Waterskiers are probably now the second biggest user group on Loch
Lomond and the vast majority of us are ordinary, decent folk going about
our recreation in an inoffensive way, often skiing as families. There is
certainly a small minority of hooligan waterskiers but they must not be
allowed to spoil things for the majority. The majority would very much
like to see the offending minority off the loch.
The Loch Lomond Waterskiers Association, which was formed last year
and now has some 480 members, is not opposed to the content of the
proposed by-laws except for one item which we consider is most
inequitable, the 7mph speed limit to a distance of 150 metres (almost
500 feet) which would apply to about 90% of the loch's shore.
This would unnecessarily, unrealistically, and unreasonably restrict
the opportunity of many local folk to enjoy their recreation of
waterskiing, a natural, exhilarating sport for people living in this
area.
To have a more or less blanket restriction round the shores when there
is hardly anyone about for so much of the time is most certainly an
unreasonable and unwarranted restriction on people's freedom, and
amounts to restriction for the sake of restriction.
In our view it would be much more appropriate if the few areas which
are subject to peak-time congestion were restricted, instead of the
unnecessary and unreasonable wholesale restriction of most of the loch's
shoreline. It would also be much more enforceable. How many folk can
accurately judge 150 metres over land, never mind water?
We appreciate certain areas also need to be restricted for
environmental and fish breeding considerations, and, given such
restrictions, it is not true to say waterskiing is environmentally
unsustainable.
Alternatively, if for some reason a near blanket shoreline restriction
must be introduced, we suggest the 150-metre distance is reduced to 50
metres. This would allow people looking for sheltered water to spread
around the loch while keeping fast craft, and waterskiers, away from the
shore.
Additionally, and importantly for family skiers of whom there are
many, the lesser distance would suit most children much better bacause
they often feel insecure and frightened far out from the shore, even
though they can swim, are properly kitted out with wetsuit and
lifejacket, and are not in any danger.
There are major items not included in the proposed by-laws which in
our view are very much needed: the compulsory boat driving test already
mentioned; compulsory third-party insurance; and a quantified
drink/drive limit the same as applies on the roads.
Boating of any sort and alcohol do not go well together. In the USA
80% of boating accidents involve drink -- a sobering statistic for many
loch users.

I READ with interest James Freeman's article on Loch Lomond by-laws,
in particular about the role of the Sports Council as surrogate objector
on behalf of a single minority group of loch users (September 11).
The Sports Council was established by Royal Charter in 1972 and the
objects are ''to foster the practice of sport and recreation among the
public at large and the provision of facilities therefor''.
By taking up cudgels on behalf of one sport which is regrettably
bedevilled by a minority hooligan element, how can this action be
reconciled with the charter object of fostering sport and recreation
among the public at large?
I would be most interested to know the answer, as I am sure would be
the many others who use Loch Lomond as a sporting or recreational
facility and whose enjoyment of that facility is marred by the
misbehaviour of the irresponsible elements among the power-craft
fraternity.
If the Sports Council is truly representative of all sports and
recreation, and it wishes to retain credibility, it must withdraw its
objection to the proposed by-laws immediately.

I WRITE as one of many who left the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on
Sunday night in a sense of rage and dismay at the impetuous and
ill-considered decision of the jury to change their own published rules.
On stage, in the presence of the four concerto finalists, the jury
chairman, Philip Ledger, inexplicably announced that the decision to
share a joint third prize of #4000 had been changed to third and fourth
prizes with respective amounts of #3000 and #1000.
As a consequence, a competitor who believed she had won #2000 was
placed fourth and publicly kicked in the teeth with her prize money
halved.
With the benefit of hindsight this decision must be regretted. If the
competition is to have any credibility in the future, a new chairman of
the jury must ensure that they agree to abide by their own decisions.
What a shame that a marvellous week of music and an evening of superb
performances from all four gifted soloists should end on such a note.

CONGRATULATIONS on Peter Lynch's Herald essay ''A Scots Mosaic''
(September 9). The writer focuses on SNP attempts at creating an all
encompassing identity.
However, I do feel that Dr Lynch falls down in one area; an area long
mistreated in Scotland. One of the contradictory aspects of Dr Lynch's
essay is its unintentional but implicit application of the Norman Tebbit
cricket test.
Yes, immigrants and their offspring must integrate into their new
circumstances. This should be an aspect of an unwritten acceptance on
the part of all immigrants. However, integration should not entail
assimiliation.
Can we not be Scottish born and remain Italian, Irish, Asian, or
Chinese? As individuals, families, and communities, so long as these
groups contribute positively to society, it should not matter if they
have little affinity for the symbols of Scottish nationhood or culture.
Personally, although not an SNP supporter, I remain open to their
cause if it can be proved to me as representing the best way forward for
Scotland. But if I did vote SNP in the future, as third-generation
Irish, I would retain my Irish identity. Voting SNP would be a political
expression unrelated to my Irish identity.
Invariably, being born here and acquiring a Scottish accent means that
I am not the same as the Irish who are born in Ireland. However, that
does not make me less Irish, nor should it mean that I am excluded from
being a full participant in multi-ethnic Scotland.
I do not pass Norman Tebbit's cricket test, nor his inferred,
football, cultural, or political test. However, I will continue to
contribute to the well-being of an as yet to emerge, plural Scotland,
and in terms which correspond to my heritage and my immigrant identity.

LAST week Mr Waldegrave, who is trying to contain his colleagues'
estimates of their spending next year, warned them that lower taxation
was possible only if they heeded him. It is possible to see the cause of
his concern in yesterday's figures for public borrowing, the amount by
which the Revenue's receipts fail to meet actual spending. The gap was
much more than expected and more than this time last year. It brought
the total up to more than that of the first five months of the last
financial year, exposing how the Chancellor's hopes for this year are
already seriously adrift. The calculation that revenues would grow, and
painlessly solve his problem, now looks shaky: to do that receipts must
grow at 11%, rather than the 7.7% so far experienced.
It is usually hard to forecast August's outcome and too much need not
be read into it, but the cumulative experience of the five months is
another matter. At the very least, any tax reductions budgeted in
November should be less than the Chancellor hoped, provided he sticks to
claims to remain prudent (and anything else would seriously dent his
standing in the City -- and the standing of sterling as well). Since
politicians tend to be professional optimists, and his buoyancy has just
been increased by the Governor of the Bank of England retracting his
demand for higher interest rates, Mr Clarke will be hoping that the
months which normally yield higher returns -- October, December, and
January -- will do exceptionally well this time. At this juncture no-one
can tell, but the present outcome is undeniably bad news.
It shows how high public spending actually is, however. In spite of
all the talk about cuts, these have not taken place; and even Mr
Waldegrave is finding it almost impossible to achieve them either, in
planned future spending. The momentum is so great because in almost
every area expectations of improvement are strong -- state spending is
an index of collective improvement. If we want that, it has to be paid
for.   As in previous General Elections, this will be a big issue, and a
head-on one next time. Last week a distinguished former economic adviser
to John Smith accused his successor of misleading the country on
financing his public spending plans. If the Government's scope for
restraining public spending is so slight, will not further improvement
be costly? And how will it be financed? Tories will hope that in these
questions lie their salvation -- but the voters' mood may be much less
selfish.

WE need not pat ourselves on the back or smile smugly at the results
from Hong Kong's first substantial democratic election in 150 years of
colonial rule. The clue to what should be justifiable feelings of shame
lies in the length of time needed for this election to take place. Nor
is it sufficient to say, as many expatriates delight in claiming, that
there was no demand for democracy during the long years of Britain's
profitable overlordship of Hong Kong. Democracy is not a function of
genetics, nor is it imbibed with mothers milk. It has to be planted,
nurtured, and encouraged and this we signally failed to do until the
1997 return to China became inevitable. No wonder many Chinese from both
Hong Kong and the mainland accuse Britain of hypocrisy. None of this is
an argument against democracy in Hong Kong. Nobody is suggesting that we
should not have bothered, that we should have simply delivered a neat
little commercial oligarchy run by Hong Kong's businessmen into the
hands of Beijing. What we should have done was to embark on the entire
exercise a good deal earlier and if this sounds like hindsight, so be
it.
What happens next in Hong Kong is fairly predictable. True, the
pro-democracy camp did well in the election but the overall turnout of
voters was predictably low. Democrats failed to seize control of the
Legislative Council for the chamber appears to be roughly split between
pro-democracy and pro-China representatives. This will have little
effect on the tactics of the Chinese who will put a parallel Legislative
Council in place in the next few months. Hong Kong Government officials
persist in their belief that the Chinese will be reluctant to dismantle
the recent reforms because they do not want to alienate the people of
Hong Kong. If only this were so. After this brief taste of democracy
Hong Kong will revert to Chinese control and to Chinese ways. We cannot
say that this could have been avoided, but we could have tried harder,
and longer to ameliorate it.

FORMER neighbours of the Graham ''family from hell'' received
Christmas cards which were not in the festive spirit, Kirkcaldy Sheriff
Court was told yesterday.
One bore the message ''flit'' and another warned, ''ho, ho, ho, your
day will come, ha, ha, ha,'' it was claimed.
The cards were allegedly sent to neighbours who gave evidence against
the Grahams, formerly of Alexander Road, Glenrothes, or who spoke out
against them in the press at the time of Glenrothes Development
Corporation's successful eviction action against them.
In court was Mrs Anne Graham, 36, now of North Street, Rosehearty,
near Fraserburgh, who denies five breach of the peace charges alleging
she caused fear and alarm to householders in Glenrothes, by sending
Christmas cards containing threatening messages on December 20.
The charges allege that the victims were Mrs Ellaline Wilson of
Pinkerton Road; Mr Ron Braid of Lundin Place; Mr Agnes Carr, Alexander
Road; Mr Colin Dow, Bethune Road; and the occupants of their homes.
One of the charges alleges that Mrs Graham also sent a card and a
letter to the home of Mrs Agnes Carr, both of which contained a
threatening message to the occupants of the house at 144 Alexander Road.
Mr Dow, 58, claimed an envelope addressed to his wife simply stated
''flit''; Mr Braid, 64, said his card bore the words ''ho,ho, ho, your
day will come, ha, ha, ha''.
Mrs Penelope Carr claimed one of two envelopes wrongly addressed to
her and delivered to her mother-in-law, contained a newspaper cutting of
her photograph with the words ''cons never lie'' on it, and also a piece
of paper stamped ''Her Majesty's Prison Barlinne'' bearing the
handwritten words, ''boys kill''.
Mrs Ellaline Wilson, 43, claimed an envelope addressed to her
contained a card with ''welcome to hell'' written on it.
Police witnesses told the court they had grounds to suspect the Graham
family and called at their home on January 8 this year.
Constable Michael Ward said he asked for a sample of Mrs Graham's
handwriting and was given a letter by her husband.
During interviews, Mrs Graham denied any knowledge of the cards.
Expert police witnesses said they could not tell if the writing on the
envelopes and cards, posted in Leven on December 20, was the same as on
the letter.
Two fingerprint experts confirmed that Mrs Graham's right thumb print
was found on the back of the card allegedly sent to Mr Braid, and her
left middle finger print was on the back of one of the envelopes
allegedly received by Mrs Carr.
Sheriff McIntyre continued the case until November 8.

SCOTLAND'S police are in favour of setting up American-style boot
camps and community service squads for young offenders who laugh at the
sentencing system.
The support for a Scottish revamp of youth sentencing follows the
launch south of the Border of a pilot ''boot camp'' scheme yesterday by
Home Secretary Michael Howard.
The pilot project, for 60 offenders aged 18 to 21 at Thorn Cross Young
Offenders' Institution in Cheshire, will open next summer with an
emphasis on discipline and hard physical training and work.
It will be followed up with vocational training, post-release
supervision, and an assessment of the scheme to be undertaken in the
spring of 1997. A study of reconviction rates will follow at the end of
1997.
Mr Howard said yesterday the new regime would be ''tough and
demanding'' with ''discipline and hard work its foundation''. Living
conditions would be austere.
Last week, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth addressed the issue of
community service orders, telling a group of Scots businessmen that
orders ''must involve hard physical work, not brutality, but visible
effort, with offenders clearing up motorways and beaches in protective
clothing which advertises what they are''.
The Scottish Police Federation yesterday supported the Thorn Cross
camp and the proposition of harder community service orders.
Mr Douglas Keil, the federation's general secretary, said the criminal
justice system had long failed to deal adequately with young offenders.
''Many youngsters who get themselves into trouble see the whole system
as a joke, something to boast about to their pals, compare notes, and
ultimately ignore,'' he said.
''Too much emphasis has been put on keeping offenders out of jail and
not enough on deterrent and punishment.
''Something the young offender does not like should happen on the
first occasion he is convicted. In that way, hopefully he or she will
not want to come back for more.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said last night: ''We have
no plans for boot camps at the moment but will watch any developments in
England and Wales''.
Reaction to the Thorn Cross proposal from penal reform campaigners and
probation workers was mixed yesterday.
Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Mr Alan Beith said: ''Before
Michael Howard throws public money into boot camp proposals, he should
look at all the experience which shows that they are not effective in
cutting crime''.
Prison Service director general Mr Derek Lewis was keen to stress the
differences between the new regime and the ''short, sharp shock'' system
introduced by the then-Home Secretary William Whitelaw in 1979, which
failed in the mid-1980s.
While the Thorn Cross camp would put a great emphasis on discipline,
the new system was much more sophisticated than the earlier experiment,
Mr Lewis said.
Highlights of the inmates' day will include a 6am wake-up with a full
inspection and drill half-an-hour later. The afternoon will consist of
physical education with running, circuit training, and an assault
course.
Lights-out will come at 10pm with inmates forbidden to talk to each
other or communicate in any way after that time. Smoking will be banned.
During the 26-week course, young offenders will receive anger
management training, basic education such as the 3Rs, learning
day-to-day skills like opening a bank account, and help with learning to
take responsibility for their own behaviour, particularly in group
situations.
Mr Paul Cavadino, chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium, said it
was ''astonishingly naive'' to believe a tough physical approach and
drills would produce law-abiding citizens.
However, he said: ''In some respects, however, the regime at Thorn
Cross differs from that of American boot camps. It will be an odd
mixture of the harsh and the helpful.
''The regime will combine a hard physical approach, which will do
nothing to reduce offending, with some constructive elements of
rehabilitation, which could do so.''

STRATHCLYDE councillors have been caught on the hop over the
controversial transfer of council water assets to the new West of
Scotland Water Authority.
Meeting in private yesterday to consider the transfer agreement,
members of the Labour group executive expressed dismay that they hadn't
been warned by officials of today's deadline for submitting the
agreement to the Scottish Office.
Consequently, a meeting of the council's water services committee,
called to consider the agreement, lasted only three minutes with
councillors agreeing to ask the Secretary of State for Scotland for a
week's extension of the deadline.
Opposition parties had been anxious to discuss the agreement but were
prevented by the committee chairman, Councillor Alex MacLean, who was no
doubt mindful of the fact that this, one of the most momentous decision
in the history of Strathclyde region, had not yet been considered by the
ruling Labour group.
Afterwards, council officials were frantically trying to contact the
Scottish Office, but were being hampered by the fact that yesterday was
an Edinburgh holiday.
Councillor MacLean, explained: ''I stopped discussion on the matter
and delayed it for a week because we're still seeking information on
certain aspects.''
He added: ''The matter was just thrown at us after last Wednesday's
council meeting. The timescale of having to submit the scheme by
tomorrow is far too tight; so we've asked for a week's delay, which I
don't think is unreasonable.''
Councillor MacLean confirmed the council was co-operating with the
Scottish Office on the asset transfer. In his view there was no sense in
doing other than that.
And he warned that councillors faced the possibility of surcharge
should the Secretary of State not concede the week's extension.
The acting Labour group leader, Councillor John Mullen, admitted he,
too, had not be aware of the proximity of the submission day and had
made his displeasure known to those concerned.

THE expansion of private pension schemes and old-age insurance schemes
is already expanding the market for private homes, both nursing and
residential. And one of the bonuses of community care is that these
private home owners are encouraged to blur the distinction, guaranteeing
care until death for people whose dependence increases.
People with the ability to pay are obviously able to choose any kind
of care they want, but there is a growing fear that today's short-term
contract culture will result in a very different scenario for the next
generation of pensioners.
The continuing proportion of unemployed and, worryingly,
never-employed people will be unable to make provision for themselves.
If the 25% of the Glasgow population who are on Income Support need care
in their old age, how will it be funded?
Right now, the businessmen are pounding their calculators because the
immediate market is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 2.5%. The
market in this case is the number of people over the age of 85 in need
of residential care.
Without a blush, they call it the care business and point to it
getting bigger in the sense of individual companies becoming larger as
well as in the sense of general expansion. Except in Scotland. While the
demographic chart mirrors the UK rise until about 2030, with a
subsequent drop, the increase in private care will -- on present trends
-- be less steady.
A forecast in the trade journal This Caring Business points to the
need for 70,000 extra beds in the UK by the year 2001 -- with no
increase in the proportion of each age-group over 65 living in homes.
Since the assumption that the extra beds are necessary is at odds with
the aim of the community care legislation to keep people in their own
homes for as long as possible, there is room for considerable discussion
over the figures. The 1991 census revealed that even among those aged 85
and more, only one-third are in residential or nursing homes or
long-stay hospitals. For those aged between 65 and 74, the proportion
drops to 3.8%.
As the range and ratio of community services increases -- as they are
supposed to do as a result of the Act -- that proportion could
reasonably be expected to drop until only those too dependent for
sheltered housing and support from home helps and community nurses,
would move into homes.
The care home owners argue that increasing private medical insurance
and the expected improvement in the property market will enable more
people to choose to go into a home, for reasons of security and
companionship, in preference to struggling with the burdens of
maintaining a house alone.
There is already evidence that local authorities prefer to place
people in single rooms if possible and that the major companies (mostly
English) with a chain of homes across the country are using their
financial power to build new purpose-designed units rather than adapt
the traditional rambling villas.
The scandals of multi-occupied rooms of the mid-80s are well and truly
over, but some care home owners in Scotland are convinced that social
work departments are still biased against the small, private homes.
Colin Barron, chairman of the Scottish Association of Care Home Owners,
says that whereas in England and Wales the Community Care Act had the
effect of local authorities closing down their directly-run homes and
placing people in the private sector, in Scotland it has meant that
social work departments have retained their own homes and fill them up
first, using the private sector as overspill.
He says that places in council homes can cost 50% more than in private
ones. The difference is mainly in rates of pay for staff. Councils pay
union rates, giving them significantly higher costs for overtime and
weekend working, but Dr Barron says the fact that they are not required
to be registered under the Act means thay have a staffing ratio of one
to 14 residents, while the private homes they register are required to
have a ratio of one to eight.
In Scotland 425 private nursing homes provide 1600 beds while 225
residential homes provide 4664 beds.
Like the voluntary sector, Dr Barron argues that the local authorities
which tie their rates to the DSS levels (between #197 and #227 for
residential care and #295 for nursing care) are underplaying the true
cost of a place. He claims that some local authorities have underspent
their community care budget and could afford to pay more and that their
refusal to do so is putting some home owners out of business.
He criticised social work departments for not costing home-care
packages to take account of all the public money involved.
The average age on admission to residential care is now 85 -- and the
average length of stay is only two or three years.
It is a significant change, partly due to people remaining in better
health for longer but also due to the enormous advances made in
community-based provision such as sheltered housing and home helps.

I WRITE to express my dismay at the spoiling action taken by the
Sports Council in submitting such comprehensive amendments to the Loch
Lomond by-laws at this late stage. Why has it not followed the example
of other bodies in co-operating with the park authority during the long
period when the by-laws were under discussion?
It would appear that the water skiers are the most powerful objectors.
What of the other water users, in particular the anglers who are the
only ones paying for using the loch?
The peace and tranquillity of Loch Lomond is one of its charms. The
noise and pollution caused by jet skiers and water skiers is a serious
matter especially to those like myself resident on the lochside.
If the present trend continues, perhaps the day must come when zoning
in its widest sense must be considered. Some lochs already impose
restrictions where power boat users must have a certificate of
competence and comprehensive insurance. Perhaps the Sports Council could
turn its attention to this and help to eliminate the hooligan element.
Meanwhile the new park authority boat, recently launched with
Government funding to meet these problems, has to stand helplessly by
powerless to take action.
I am afraid that until the park authority is given the necessary
authority and resources Loch Lomond will never reach its true potential
as an internationally recognised park. Call it national park or not, it
is the management and resources that are important.

WHEN the extent of the mistakes made during the cervical smear
screening programme at Inverclyde became evident there was general
disbelief. This was largely because the procedures involved were not
supposed to be particularly difficult and also because medical
programmes of this sort are invested with great faith by those who
receive their services. The inquiry into what went wrong at Inverclyde
Royal Hospital between 1987 and 1992 revealed a sorry state of affairs
which led to the re-testing of thousands of women and, almost as
importantly, a growing questioning over the methods used. Many of these
have been answered by the working party which examined the problems of
Inverclyde in detail. It is clear in retrospect that the Inverclyde
laboratory was under-staffed, under-financed, and not using the latest
techniques.
The response of the working party is to provide a long list of
improvements which should be undertaken by laboratories offering this
service. Very properly the Secretary of State for Scotland has accepted
the recommendations of the working party and has said that they will be
implemented.   Various considerations follow from this welcome decision.
The first is that public confidence in the screening programme must be
re-established while recognising that it is unrealistic to expect
perfection. What can be expected is absolute standards applied uniformly
and these will now be established. The more technical suggestions,
including the rapid re-scan of each negative smear, appear sensible and
more likely to pick up aberrations than the random one-in-10 sampling
method which did not appear particularly effective even to laymen. The
establishment of the new methods will cost money. Mr Forsyth was quick
to point out that screening services must be run efficiently and present
value for money. The real value for money is success and if the latest
measures contribute to success they must be properly funded. Moreover,
the funding which must be found for laboratories offering the screening
service must not be taken from other medical programmes. Robbing Peter
to pay Paul has become all too prevalent in the NHS; it should not apply
here.

PIE that is humble takes more chewing. Two months have passed since a

concerned morsels of information conveyed here that fell short of gross
exactness. What stuck in the teeth had to do with doon the watter.
For insisting it is a vile phrase, no apology. Dictionaries will have
nothing to do with it, nor should anybody else. Worse than fuddy-duddy,
it is phoney. Patronised by it is anybody who ever took a sail on the
Clyde estuary.
Besides, good doubts (mainly mine) persist about whether real people
ever used the words. They were never part of the patois. Nobody who
regularly went for a Clyde holiday said it was to doon the watter.
Voyagers who preferred Rothesay said they were going to Rothesay. If
Saltcoats was their pleasure, they said so.
So far, so safe.
Where the paddles came off was to suggest the expression might be of
recent invention. It was further hazarded that the words had first been
blinked into the sunshine by a journalist. They had been used by a
wordsmith who had wearied of every July using exodus for the Fair
stampede to the coast. A likely source seemed the Sunday Post.
Along with such good, sound-seeming stuff went a plea for an end to
doon the watter. It has worked a treat. For two months the dire words
have not once swum into my ken. It remains only to get through this
coming holiday weekend, and there will be clear water for the rest of
the tourist year. Frankly, it feels like a triumph of sorts.
Also frankly, success has been otherwise mixed. Marks for the rest of
the speculation amount to, say, four out of l0 -- not good, but not bad
fishing either.
Above all, the dating was wrong. Doon the watter has been a blot on
the printed page for more than a century.
From his learned shelves Adam McNaughtan, bookseller and rhymer of
this parish, showed a bound volume of Quiz weekly magazine for l884.
Leaping from its summer holiday edition, a cartoon showed a drookit
fellow under a ragged umbrella. He is being pelted upon. In italics to
emphasise the whimsy the artist has added the caption FAIR Saturday --
DOON THE WATTER.
Oddly, however, there is watter, watter nowhere else in the magazine.
Mr Quiz did not love the Fair. He liked to sneer at its mass plebeian
excesses. He chronicles with glee how a riverboat captain alleged to him
that as many as six unruly fare-paying passengers had to be put in
irons.
Yet when Mr Quiz reports the horror of the holiday he does so in
civilised language. He writes about people going to the coast. His pages
are not doused with cold watter.
Regrettably (for me) that happened only four years later in a small
epic poem entitled Doon the Watter at the Fair by a makar called Bass
Kennedy.
He tells of an elderly couple -- she a former mill lass who, bless
her, wears a Paisley shawl; he a Brigton weaver chiel -- who in the 35
years of their marriage have every July taken a holiday on the Clyde and
hope to keep doing so for as long as they are spared.
Bass Kennedy ends his work:
A twalmonth's toil in Glesca toun
Is lichtsome, I declare,
Wi' twa-three days' diversion doon
The watter at the Fair.
His poem is reprinted in Mungo's Tongues, a collection of Glasgow
poems through three centuries edited by Hamish Whyte, a librarian who
keeps adding to the cataloguing his colleagues have to do by producing
many books.
Little is known about the doon the watter perpetrator. ''Kennedy seems
to have been a kind of poet laureate of the Govan area,'' Hamish Whyte
said. It would be good to have more, if only because of the laureate's
profoundly musical name.
Other bardic offerings by him included verses for the opening of the
Elder Park, along with memorial lines about other Govanites. He could
pen poetry about a train trip to Prince's Pier. Bass Kennedy even put a
football jersey on his muse:
Glancing off the cross-bar,
Grazing either pole;
Rushing, crushing, pushing, boys --
Hurrah! another goal!
This effort in l887 won him the prize in a song competition in The
People's Friend. Maybe, my guess about the Sunday Post wasn't totally
awry. Although three out of l0 would have been nearer the mark, this has
been a most scholarly wee sail.
Except it ought to be capped by an even earlier comic epic about the
delights of estuary steamboats. In light verses it retails how all the
weans get seasick and paw falls in the water. For four days all the
family's glum faces are pressed to the window of their digs staring out
at the rain. Then a wayward daughter discovers sex. On the way home it
is vowed never again.
This masterpiece, called Down the Water by Patrick Buchan, appeared in
l842. Unhappily, although the title looks like dictionary English, the
author permits himself to rhyme water with patter. He seems bent on
hugging my grading down to a wan l0%. ''Does anybody care about all this
any more?'' Hamish Whyte asked.

In day two of our series Jennifer Cunningham and Gavin Bell look at a
model community, at possible solutions to present inequities of care,
and at ways to help the pensioners of tomorrow
NELL ROSS had fun yesterday, and she can look forward to another good
day tomorrow. She may be 85 years old and a widow, but Nell knows how to
enjoy life -- and happily there is no shortage of good neighbours to
help her get the most out of it.
Every day she walks with a home help to an elegant sandstone building
on the South Side of Glasgow where she is greeted by dozens of friends.
The main recreation room on an upper floor of the building is a kind of
home from home for Nell and hundreds of other elderly folk who gather
every day for a cup of tea and a chat, a game of cards or bingo, and
regular social evenings.
It is the nucleus of a remarkable community which is highly regarded
in the voluntary sector as a model of sympathetic and effective care,
with an evolutionary approach that augurs well for the future. Founded
in 1972 as a lunch club for local elderly residents, the Dixon Community
in the Govanhill district of the city now cares for more than 1500
people with a range of services from home helps to street wardens and
residential facilities.
Its philosophy of supporting ''good neighbour'' schemes -- essentially
encouraging people to help each other -- accords with the views of
organisations such as Age Concern Scotland. Lucy Mackenzie of Age
Concern says: ''The response we usually get from elderly people is that
they want to continue living in their own homes without being a burden
to their family. So ideally we should be considering what individuals
need, and setting up a package to provide them, rather than creating
some kind of institution and saying this is what is on offer. In this
respect, the Dixon Community is a very impressive organisation.''
The woman at the heart of the organisation is Sheila Halley, an
energetic, cheerful woman who insists that the success of the venture is
due to common sense -- plus selfless devotion to others, of course.
''There is a lot of goodwill out there,'' she says. ''All we have done
is to tap into it and help to organise it. If you have a lot of elderly
people living alone and craving friendship and support, it's just common
sense to bring them together, isn't it?''
Well, yes. But what has distinguished the Dixon Community is the
extent to which it has galvanised the residents of a large area,
previously blighted by inner-city decay, into caring for each other. And
all on a shoestring budget.
''What we have been trying to do is to fill in the gaps that families
would fill if they were there,'' Ms Halley says. ''We provide a place
for them to come and enjoy companionship and entertainment if they want,
and help with chores in their own homes if they need it. I suppose the
basic aim is to enable elderly people to continue living in their own
homes as long as possible with dignity and flexible support. As people's
needs change, we can adapt.''
What that means in real terms is a day centre in the Dixon Halls -- a
splendid Victorian burgh hall erected by the owner of the Govan Iron
Works in 1879 -- which provides meals, bingo sessions, arts and crafts
classes, carpet bowls, bus excursions, and Saturday night dances and
sing-songs. A day at the centre, with meals included, costs #1.20, and
most of the activities are organised by the elderly themselves. An
adjacent building houses modern flats for 10 local people suffering from
dementia, which are staffed around the clock.
It also means 400 volunteers providing a bedding-down service in
private homes, administering late-night medication, hairdressing, doing
the shopping, collecting pensions, and just popping in occasionally for
a wee chat. These good neighbour schemes are not intended to replace
professional home helps, Ms Halley says, they are just the icing on the
cake of community care.
Having focused initially on elderly people living alone, Ms Halley
turned her attention to the carers -- the relatives and friends whose
own lives are degraded by the strains of coping with infirm dependants.
''It would do a lot of good for people to come along to our carers'
forums and listen to some of the horror stories they have to tell,'' she
says.
So a helpline was set up for carers, to provide assistance in
emergencies and offer solutions to long-term problems. To their profound
relief, many carers have been able to return to full-time employment,
secure in the knowledge that their mum or dad is quite happy during the
day making new friends at the Dixon Halls.
In the amiable confusion of the main recreation hall, it is not always
easy to distinguish between the visitors and the volunteers. Dolly
Conroy, 77, could be either, but in fact she is one of the main
organisers as chair of the members' committee. She said, ''I'd go as far
as to say there isn't a club anywhere in Britain as good.''
Mrs Conroy's use of the word ''club'' says a lot about the ambiance of
the community. So do the smiles and the greetings of folk arriving in
mini-buses for the day's activities at the day centre. The core funding
from Strathclyde Regional Council and the Greater Glasgow Health Board
is relatively small, but it is obviously well spent.
Asked to sum up the Dixon experience, she says: ''I would say here is
a community that has built up a nucleus of caring support for its
elderly, which poses the question: what is happening in other areas that
don't have it? How much loneliness and unhappiness is out there?''
Nell Ross, the sprightly 85-year-old with a zest for life, has the
answer: ''A lot of us in here would be sad cases if we didn't have the
Dixon Halls to come to. I'd be at home staring at four bare walls.''

Allan Laing wonders why Channel 4 chose Glasgow hardman, Paul Ferris,
to appear in a new series examining gangland Britain and male violence.
FIRST things first. Paul John Ferris did not murder Arthur Thompson
Jnr. A jury cleared him of the charge at the High Court in Glasgow three
years ago. So who did? Well, someone reckoned it was Paul's mates, Joe
''Bananas'' Hanlon and Bobby Glover. Which is why the two Glasgow hoods
were executed (by persons as yet unknown) on the morning of young
Arthur's funeral.
But whatever Paul Ferris is not, he most certainly is a frighteningly
violent young man. And the chilling thing about him, when you see him on
a television screen, is the fact that he is not chilling. At least, not
to look at. He appears ordinary; you would pass him on the street
without a second glance. And that is probably just as well, for a second
glance might bring you to his attention. And you do not want to be drawn
to the attention of Paul John Ferris.
Next week, should you choose to allow it, this East End gangster will
enter your living-room late at night and, in the company of another
villain (John McVicar who, having paid his debt to society, has gone on
to become a media celebrity), he will tell you what violence means to
him. In a genuinely shocking Channel 4documentary programme, Chapter And
Verse, Ferris will claim that he is neither a bully nor a gangster.
And then he will add this sentence: ''But that doesn't mean you've to
let people stand on your toes; if they do that then you've got to jump
on their neck and break it.'' Some things are worth repeating: Paul
Ferris is a frighteningly violent young man. Listen to his words.
The picture of Glasgow painted, not so much by Ferris, but by the
production company which made the programme, is coloured blood red. It
is the stark meanness of no mean city. Though highly-stylised
(sensational, if you prefer) in its approach, it is an intense study of
a criminal mind. By using reconstruction, CCTV footage, and interviews
with relatives and key figures in Ferris's background, the film maps out
the perceived landscape of the vicious Glasgow we prefer to ignore (and,
indeed, the Glasgow which most of us seldom witness).
McVicar, in his introduction, says: ''Glasgow has a gangland murder
rate which rivals Palermo.'' Here they prefer ''making trouble to making
money.'' In the local drug trade, he adds, the violence is, ''less
personal and more business-like.''
Ferris recalls his life in an ice-cold, matter-of-fact way. Nowhere
along the line does he renounce the violence which has surrounded him.
''I've always used a weapon of sorts,'' he says, ''whether it be a
baseball bat or a knife.''
He learned early that retaliation was the best way, not only to gain
respect among his peers, but also to survive in Glasgow's criminal
underbelly. He tells McVicar that, at the age of 13, he was bullied by a
notorious local family. That taught him a lesson; that the use of
weapons was the only true and effective deterrent.
It was after a firearms conviction that Ferris came to the attention
of Arthur Thompson Snr, gangland boss, who employed him to collect
money. Seduced by the easy life, he couldn't understand why someone
should go out and earn a pittance for an honest day's work when, for
just 10 minutes of criminal enterprise, you could earn the equivalent of
six-months' wages.
Things turned ugly for Ferris when Arthur Jnr, Thompson's son and heir
to the family empire, was shot dead while on home release from an
11-year stretch for a drugs conviction. Ferris was suspected along with
Hanlon and Glover (''the brothers I never had,'' he calls them). After a
celebrated trial which put paid to any lingering hope that Glasgow was a
city of culture, he was acquitted of Arthur Jnr's murder but his two
mates were dead. The killings remain unsolved and the question remains
unanswered. Were they executed in revenge for Thompson's death or were
they killed by someone who feared that the pair would expose the real
assassins?
What is certain is the fact that, though Paul Ferris denies that his
life is in danger, he is still inclined to look over his shoulder three
years on. A sick joke, doing the rounds of the crime reporters shortly
after his acquittal springs to mind. Question -- What's the difference
between Elvis Presley and Paul Ferris? Answer -- Paul Ferris is
definitely dead.
At the end of the day he accepts that crime comes as naturally as
breathing to him. ''If anyone was born into crime, it was me. Crime is
in my blood,'' he remarks.
The documentary is part of a fortnight season of C4 programmes,
Battered Britain, which amounts to an in-depth survey of contemporary
violence. And Ferris, like the proverbial bad penny pops up again. In
the second of a series of half-hour debates broadcast every weekday
morning next week, he will join a panel of guests to discuss male
violence, a subject in which he can justifiably claim to be an expert.
Hosted by Elaine C Smith, the Living With Violence series is being
recorded in Glasgow this week.
Joining Ferris will be convicted murderer Hugh Collins, who 20 years
after the killing of a gangland enemy realises the futility of his
actions; and notorious football casual Paul Blackwell, infamously
captured on film in the act of stabbing another supporter. Also involved
in the programme are Jack Maple, the deputy police commissioner of the
NYPD, and journalist Pat Kane.
The Battered Britain season is underpinned by some new research,
specially commissioned by C4. In a special edition of Frontline the
suggestion is made that the fear of crime is often a bigger problem than
crime itself. It looks first at the lengths many people will go to
protect themselves -- the young businesswomen who take karate lessons,
the elderly pensioner who barricades herself into her home with a vast
array of locks, alarms, and chains.
Then it turns to experts in criminology who explain that such fears
are out of proportion to the reality of violence. Parents are five times
more likely to win the Lottery jackpot than to have their child abducted
by a stranger. Assaults on women are almost always perpetrated by the
man sitting next to them on the sofa. The number of serious attacks
suffered by the elderly is statistically insignificant.
According to Frontline, public anxiety is heightened and distorted by
media coverage of crime. So now we know. Paul Ferris is innocent and,
once again, it's the nasty newspapers which are to blame for society's
ills. According, of course, to Channel 4'sscrupulously non-sensational
fortnight of programmes about crime.

THERE are solutions to the inequities of care for the elderly, but for
most of them there is a price to pay, according to Edward Richards of
the independent London Economics group.
Richards, who is conducting a study of long-term care on behalf of the
left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research, says: ''What we have at
the moment effectively penalises thrift, in that some people are faced
with losing their homes and savings to pay for long-term care while
others who have saved nothing are looked after at the state's expense.''
The first obvious solution, he says, is substantially to increase the
asset allowance of #8000 above which people must pay for their own care
costs. Mr Richards suggests a figure of #60,000, being roughly the
average value of a house, which would help many people at least to
retain possession of their homes.
The problem is that this would transfer the burden of long-term care
from the individual to the state, which would have to be paid for either
by higher taxes or cuts in other areas of public spending.
Another solution would be to make private insurance schemes cheaper
and more attractive by linking them with pensions and making them
eligible for tax relief. Again, however, there would be a cost in terms
of lost tax revenue which would have to be made up by raising taxes
elsewhere or cutting other services.
Richards has other reservations about private sector solutions: ''We
still don't know whether tax concessions would be balanced by long-term
savings on state health care. And inevitably private schemes would be
taken up by only a fairly selective group of better-off people, so they
would probably not resolve the inequity issues.''
In the longer term he says some form of compusory social insurance may
be necessary.
Richards favours a ''pay-as-you-go'' system, under which the present
older generation would be supported immediately by contributions from
today's working population, which in turn would be supported in old age
by the next generation.
''The problem with this system is that it is similar to the present
national insurance scheme, which many people feel has failed them.
''The truth is that there are no easy answers to long-term care for
the elderly.
''There is a lot of scaremongering going on. Some people are saying
the problem is spiralling out of control. That is simply not true, but
we must begin mapping out new strategies now.''

PEOPLE should be responsible for themselves -- that is the view of
David Marsland, Professor of Social Sciences at Brunel University
College and one of the Adam Smith Institute's proselyters. He believes
there should be what he describes as an honest two-tier system.
''If I am paying for a nursing home out of my savings, it should be of
higher quality than that enjoyed by my idle sister who has squandered
her money,'' is how he sums it up.
''Although people like me are quite willing to say that sort of thing
in public, politicians are very reluctant. There is a constituency of
opinion there which wants to know why people should have something free
when others are going to have to pay for it, but we need a Mrs Thatcher
figure to deliver it to the public.''
Professor Marsland acknowledges that people genuinely unable to
provide for themselves need to be cared for from public resources but
says there should be a minimum standard of ''mere adequacy''.
Tinkering with the threshold of allowable assets, for example raising
the current exemption of #8000 to something in line with the average
house price, is not the real solution to the problem as he sees it. ''I
suppose people with assets above that level at the moment might be
tempted to spend them, but it is hardly something one would want to
encourage.
''If they understood that in old age they would be living in a large
place with a number of other people in each room and being cared for by
people with no more than adequate skills, they would save to get
something better. It is morally wrong even if it makes financial sense
to give money away to your children or go off and spend it on beer and
skittles or whatever to make yourself eligible for state support,'' he
said.
He is equally dismissive of compulsory social insurance. ''State
support will always be unreliable and inadequate. There is no reason why
it should not be done privately but not compulsorily. A large proportion
of people are now in occupational or personal pension schemes and there
are perfectly good insurance schemes and they will be more efficacious
than the state would be.''
Professor Marsland says there is no reason why there should be a large
proportion of people unemployed -- perhaps 10% who can be catered for by
the state system and the others can manage to make their own provision.
Despite fears about the contract culture he argues that 80% of the
population is in employment sufficiently secure to allow them to put
something aside for old age.

William Russell goes behind the doors of Britain's former Secret
Services HQ to discover what lurks behind its massive walls before the
developers move into the old spy house and give it the
wine-bar-and-offices treatment
SMILEY'S people lived here; Harry Palmer fiddled his expenses
somewhere behind these massive walls; Anthony Blunt probably paid the
occasional call; James Bond may well have goosed Miss Moneypenny in the
lift; and M did whatever M was in the habit of doing.
No 1 Curzon Street, home until six months ago of the Secret Services,
MI5 and MI6, is up for sale, the latest ''surplus to requirements''
Government building to be put on the market by the Department of the
Environment for an anticipated #70m, give or take.
A thirties monstrosity of no architectural merit whatsoever, it is
virtually impossible to turn into anything other than a building fit for
spies -- or civil servants. It could never make a luxury hotel -- so low
the ceilings, so dingy the interior corridors, so narrow the staircases,
so dire the outlook.
As a freehold site with planning permission from Westminster Council,
it is very valuable indeed and the proposed redevelopment, to include
offices, shops, a wine bar, and three mews houses, has had the usual
suspects from the Middle and Far East expressing keen interest.
Nobody can remember when a site of this size last became available in
Mayfair. Triangular in shape, about an acre in area, it is flanked by
Clarges Street and Clarges Mews, while just around the corner is
Berkeley Square, where the nightingales sang for free, and across Curzon
Street lies Shepherd Market where the birds are female and the songs
expensive.
At No 1, however, officially a Ministry of Defence building since
1972, when it was vacated by the Department of Education and Science, no
birds sing. Even today just what went on in the low-ceilinged rooms,
tiny cells opening off the dismal corridor which runs the length of the
building on each floor, is shrouded in mystery because of the Official
Secrets Act.
But it was here for nearly a quarter of a century that Britain's spies
lurked behind the walls, a metre thick in the basement of the six-storey
building which has no windows at street level.
A secret interior road, with entrances at either end guarded by solid
metal gates, allows people to come and go without being seen coming in
through the main doors, and there is an annexe housing vast windowless
computer rooms so secret that even the estate agent showing me round
yesterday had not seen them before.
Off limits to most of the people working in the building, they had
only just been unlocked by the previous occupants' engineers, who had
been removing all traces of their use.
Knight, Frank and Rutley, handling the sale for the Government, say it
is 20 years since such a Mayfair property came on the market, if one
ever did in this part of London. It is out to informal tender until
September 29, after which the Government will consider the bids.
On the sixth floor is the remains of the spies' bar, provided to keep
the spooks from using the hostelries of Shepherd Market and indulging in
careless talk. The Grape and Vine or The Pig of fiction, was the Eye
Club of reality, according to a notice pinned to the wall. The bar
counter, about 30ft long, curved at one end, is made of rather nasty
veneered brown wood, and beyond the cafeteria, the fittings long gone,
stretches to infinity.
At least here the windows let in daylight. On the lower floors, where
there were computers, the air conditioning ducts block most of the
windows.
Fifth men, fourth men, faceless men, loyal men and treacherous men
have all come and gone from this building owned by the Government since
1947. Built in the late 1930s, it appears to have been requisitioned for
use during the last war. The Department of Health is believed to have
used it for a time, and Margaret Thatcher was certainly there from
1970-72 as Education Secretary.
In the empty rooms tangled power cables and telephone wires hang
sadly, the listening machines to which they were once linked no longer
there, and holes gape in the floors through which terminals were
connected to the mainframe computer.
There is little else to see, beyond a couple of lewd pin-up pictures
on the wall and the notice on one of the secure rooms inside which
people could talk without being overhead, which reads: ''The door
surround may be coated with vaseline. Be careful, it may stain your
clothing'' -- to which some wag has added ''and draw attention to your
sexual perversities''.
By the iron gate opening on to Clarges Street there is a red light,
below which a notice indicates the response should it start flashing --
''Suspected hostile activity. Consider Counter Measures.''

Tom Gallagher considers the changing fortunes of Slobodan Milosevic,
architect of the Greater Serbian nightmare
THE wily Balkan fox Slobodan Milosevic would never have exposed
himself to the dangers that West European leaders risk on their visits
to Sarajevo: Spain's Foreign Minister, Javier Solana and, yesterday,
Malcolm Rifkind had the closest of shaves while visiting a city still in
the throes of war.
But it would only be natural if a cold realist like Milosevic was
beginning to ponder if his own end might turn out to be a violent and
ignoble one. As more and more of his pieces are swept off the Balkan
chessboard there are a growing number of Serbs, some once loyal to him,
who view him as a traitor who has brought ruin down on the Serb cause.
Even in the glory days after 1992, when Serb forces controlled 30% of
Croatia and 70% of Bosnia, there were a few Balkan experts prepared to
stick their necks out and predict that the end game would be civil war
in Serbia itself: Milosevic's audacious prize of a Serbian empire from
the Adriatic to the Danube was simply beyond the resources of the Serbs
and was bound to produce a counter-response which would shatter Serb
unity.
But until a few months ago it looked unlikely that Milosevic would be
on any losing side. He still had good cards to play. Despite the ravages
of western sanctions on his economy, he retained an efficient
bureaucracy that was loyal to him; the military had been tamed by
repeated purges and he had built up a loyal police force; the state
media told Serbs that Milosevic could do no wrong and most of those in
the small towns and villages of provincial Serbia had no reason to think
otherwise.
After all, despite sanctions, Milosevic was still courted assiduously
by the West; in July 1993 he had kept the Belgian Foreign Minister Willy
Claes (now NATO's Secretary-General) waiting in Belgrade for three days
before refusing to see him. After his mood softened and he urged his
clients in Bosnia to negotiate, Douglas Hurd and his successor as
Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, had no hesitation about declaring
him to be the key to peace, despite being widely seen as the architect
of the Yugoslav tragedy. The current peace deal being promoted by US
envoy Richard Holbrooke would preserve most of the Serb territorial
gains in Bosnia.
Even after the fall of the Serbian Krajina to Croat forces in August,
Milosevic still seemed fireproof. Rallies in Belgrade called by
nationalists crying sell-out were thinly attended. Red Star Belgrade
football fans abused Milosevic from the terraces but then went quietly
home.
It is not just his critics who admit that this inscrutable leader has
no long-term strategy other than his own survival. He jumped on the
nationalist tiger in the late 1980s to get to the top and allow as much
of the old communist system to endure as the rest of eastern Europe
embraced democracy.
When a world horrified by ethnic cleansing in Croatia and Bosnia
carried out by Milosevic's henchmen, imposed sanctions he had a rethink.
By 1993 his aim was to reintegrate Serbia into the international
community and be left in control of half of Bosnia.
But he has been unable to bottle up the nationalist demons he released
upon going for broke in the Balkans in 1991. The rebel Serbs in Bosnia
have rejected compromise peace deals that would have prevented an exodus
of their people. Today, having foolishly goaded NATO beyond endurance,
their statelet is fragmenting as hundreds of square miles fall to their
enemy with each passing day.
The refugees from the Krajina and now from Bosnia itself pouring into
Serbia are bound to subvert his tightly-run state. It is clear that many
blame Milosevic personally for the ruination that has befallen them.
People without land, homes or prospects are easy fodder for the radical
nationalists led by Vojislav Seselj who have been gunning for Milosevic
ever since he started to play the moderate card.
The secret police and the regular police contain many officials from
Bosnia and Krajina. Whatever the precautions taken to silence dissent,
his own praetorian guard is likely to be a threat to him now.
And even Radovan Karadzic has openly accused Milosevic of turning his
back on the Serb cause.
Serbia is polarised between a tiny elite of war profiteers and mafia,
no more than 5% of the people, another 20% in the public services
shielded from hard times and thus loyal to Milosevic, and millions of
others who are quietly going hungry or selling their possessions. A
country of 10 million has only one million left in formal jobs, with
another million on upaid leave.
A diet of nationalism provided by the media stilled discontent from
liberal anti-war Serbs. But it is inevitable that challengers will soon
be after Milosevic's crown by accusing him of being a false patriot. His
record is one not without mistakes.
In 1991 he was unable to motivate the Yugoslav army into seizing
enough territory from Croatia which would have turned Greater Serbia
into a reality. In 1992 he allowed Macedonia, known as south Serbia
before 1941, to slip from Belgrade's grip and become an independent
state. In 1995 he refused to allow his own army to defend Croatian land
inhabited by Serbs for centuries, perhaps even making a deal with Zagreb
over the Krajina.
Having made his pact with the nationalist devil, the Balkan
Mephistopheles is finding it difficult to renege. He is stuck with
Karadzic, the client who became a challenger and with the butcher
General Mladic.
This week 70,000 desperate Serb refugees are milling around the
streets of Banja Luka as enemy forces close in from the north and west.
If the citadel of Bosnian Serbdom collapses, the tide of refugees into
Serbia might overwhelm Milosevic's authority and produce deadly strife
in Serbia.
The next few days may well see whether Milosevic can resist making
another somersault. Nato forces fear he will return to high-risk
nationalism by deploying his forces to prevent the fall of Banja Luka.
In a very fluid and unpredictable situation, the consequences of this
would be incalculable. A well-armed Croatia and Serbia would be in
direct confrontation; it might even be the signal for rebellion in
Muslim parts of Serbia such as Kosovo and the Sandjak. What Russia would
do if Nato engaged Serbian planes over Bosnia is anyone's guess.
If the present crisis can be ridden out, it is surely high time for
the West to stop viewing Slobodan Milosevic as a force for stability in
the Balkans. He cares more for his own skin that for the welfare of
ordinary Serbs. Hundreds of thousands have been the victims of his power
lust. It's time for the West to be rid of him.

A world of sport awaits armchair supporters -- if they have satellite
TV. Bob Crampsey considers the cost to traditional channels and sport
itself.
THE traditional broadcasting organisations, ITV and BBC, have
retreated doggedly yet a little further on the sporting front. Next
weekend Britain and Europe may do wonders in the Ryder Cup and Paul
Gascoigne may or may not acquit himself well in his first Old Firm match
tonight. In neither case will the bulk of viewers be able to judge as
the action unfolds. Terrestrial television has lost out, as it is
increasingly doing.
The scheming moguls so feared by us traditionalists have every right
to plead consent of the victims. One sport after another has rushed to
sign contracts of long duration for large sums. The whole affair may be
nothing more than a sensible application of business principles, to wit:
* You have something we want.
* We will pay you handsomely.
* Here is what you want.
End of story.
Or it would be if we were not talking about sport and that strange 10%
which pervades it, not the agent's fee in this case but that
inconvenient, residual sentiment which is at the core of every sporting
affiliation.
If terrestrial television totally loses its ability to compete for the
great sporting event does that matter? There is a simple answer after
all; let the public speed up its hitherto glacial acquisition of
satellite and cable channel facilities.
For satellite can do things for sports that at present the traditional
broadcasters cannot. The Ryder Cup went to BSkyB because that
organisation could promise not only a contract for the contest but, in
addition, increased coverage of future golf and sponsorship of a
specific event, the British Masters.
And might it not be argued that lack of availability on ITV and BBC
will increase the number of those actually attending matches. Evidence
from America would appear to run counter to this. The citizens of
America, deprived for a full year of watching baseball on television
under any auspices, have responded on the resumption of major league
baseball by inflicting a 20% drop in attendances.
Should the great national occasions in sport which have hitherto been
held sacrosanct be preserved for BBC? On what logical lines are we going
to argue? Are Test matches such occasions? I would say yes, as are
soccer internationals, but Wimbledon is a tournament where competitors
are playing for their own hand and the same is true of the Open
Championship, and indeed all golf except the Ryder and Walker Cups, with
their female equivalents the Curtis and the Solheim.
The BBC's performance has been good but not unblemished. It covers
Test cricket admirably. But its commitment to the cradle of the game,
county cricket, is non-existent and the Sunday League has been adroitly
frozen out.
The build-up to the climax in certain events such as the Open
Championship and Test matches is inevitably almost painfully slow but
you can't leave a Test match for five minutes every hour without missing
something of moment, and these days the BBC takes the break too often.
Sponsors would probably prefer a greater ITV involvement with sport
since, despite dipping figures, the channel commands greater viewing
numbers than Sky or Eurosport can muster. Interestingly, most of ITV
subsisted quite happily in its first five or so years without sport. For
a not inconsiderable time STV was the only commercial station in Britain
to run a regular sports programme. Most of the sports-free stations did
very well and one or two might be considering that the time has come to
repeat the experiment.
The sweep of the newer channels may well be quite irresistible in the
short term but certain things will arise from it. Sport will sprawl all
across the week, as football already does. The impact of cup-tie days is
diminished since the simultaneous reception of news from all the other
matches is no longer possible. There will be a move from the match to
the staged event.
It's a safe bet that at this moment at ITV the prayer is going up:
''Oh Lord, if there be only one British survivor from the league
sections of the European Cup let it not be Rangers.'' Rules will be
strained to ensure that the rich and powerful survive. It's already
happening.
The spectator will also have to adjust; golfers will be expected
meekly to concede their Sundays to re-arrange football fixtures.
Far-travelled Old Firm supporters have to alter their New Year travel
plans at the last minute.
If the sports need the new outlets the converse is certainly true. A
prospective purchaser of satellite looking at today's newspaper cannot
but be struck by the prevalence in the sports channels of such
crowd-pullers as aerobics, decathlon, wrestling, and junior golf. A
good-going dogfight would attract more watchers than any of these.
Perhaps the non-traditionalist's most powerful argument is that
satellite is what the players want and it is unarguable that for years
their participation, without which there were no matches, went
unrewarded. Boxing promoter Frank Warren has said that ''these guys want
top money for putting their lives on the line''. Only a fool would deny
that recent bouts have had life-threatening outcomes but equally will
the public stand for some of the buffoonery which has recently passed
for title fights?
In a worst-case scenario, rugby clubs will disband their second,
third, and fourth fifteens and cricket will close down the county
championship because both cost money. In the short term, I fear that the
governing bodies of the major sports will not be able to retain control
of them. If they cannot get it back then we have a Middle Ages scenario
with powerful barons -- the moguls -- in charge of squabbling retainers
-- the players.
In the long run -- despite the fact that Alexander Cairncross, the
famous economist, pointed out that in the long run we are all dead --
I'm sufficiently hopeful to believe that the governors will once again
govern.

Sue Innes finds a new book presenting women's own accounts of
childbirth and motherhood leaves a number of questions unanswered
VIVIEN DEVLIN'S account of motherhood over 70 years is needed; it
illuminates a striking silence. She has drawn together from painstaking
research, letters, a questionnaire and interviews with women aged from
93 to 15, a mass of material which is sometimes revealing, often banal.
But from it she has come to no conclusions which offer insight beyond
the average magazine article.
The material, she has perhaps reasoned, must stand on its own. And
individually many of these stories are fascinating: the midwife working
in slums where the police would not escort her, fleas and bedbugs a
working hazard; the sad and honestly-faced account of a baby boy who
lived only a few hours; the pain of giving birth remembered with
intensity after 60 years; a despairing account of a mismanaged recent
labour; a mother reflecting on everyday love, beautifully and simply
expressed.
For creating a means by which women could talk about experience which
is immensely important both individually and socially, Vivien Devlin is
to be congratulated.
Talking about birth after the event and reflecting on everyday life
bringing up children is repressed and devalued in male-dominated
culture. In research for my own recent book on women's changing lives I
was startled by the absence of accounts of motherhood by mothers: there
is a massive ''how to'' literature, and mothers are studied as an
unavoidable extra to child development, but although it is central to
human life maternity as experience is hardly visible.
But Devlin claims in her introduction that she intends to look at
''what being a mother means'', to give, ''a broad social and historical
overview''. Instead meaning is drained, mainly because of the lack of
social and historical context. This is the slice-and-serve school of
editing; excerpts from interviews are packaged under a variety of
chapter headings in roughly date order, with no introduction for the
speaker or where she lived and how.
Significant and contradictory statements are not pursued; potentially
revelatory comments left hanging in the air. You wish for fewer stories
more thoroughly told.
Experience has been turned into a list and there is a limit to how
many times you can read without wearying variations on ''I used
towelling and gauze nappies . . .'' The device of breaking the tone by
including quotations from literature adds very little.
Her comment that, ''I concentrated on assessing the level of
commitment to mothering and family life'' as a means of comparison is
both arrogant and unthinking.
The chapter, Commitment to Motherhood, is about whether or not mothers
work should outside the home; that this is not a measure of commitment
to the relationship and the children, but instead that mothers who also
work outside the home and mothers who don't are managing an equal
commitment differently seems not to have occurred to Devlin, who
apparently accepts that at-home mothering is the real thing, all else
watered down.
But you are still their mother full-time, no matter what else you do.
That historically specific factors beyond women's own choices shape how
we bring up children (and how far there is any choice), including
changing family size and domestic work, economic change and changing
patterns of employment, cultural pressures and social sanctions, has
scarcely impinged.
An interesting question, for me, is why so many of the older women
need to insist that what worked for them is right and must work for
everyone. Why is their tone so judgmental and why do they need to
justify their lives? I suspect that the answer may be in the lack of
real respect given to their work as mothers, but there is no space here
to take any inquiry deeper.
Nor is there any recognition of the glow that memory may add, or that
the narratives we tell ourselves have been edited to our own purposes.
Too many are of the ''we were short of money but made the best of things
. . .'' type, which slips easily into complacency. It was a simpler,
finer world apparently then . . . But let's not pretend it's the whole
truth.
Mothering, more than must human activities, is measured against an
unrealistic template of perfection -- which turns quickly to blame.
Particularly because so many contributors are women beyond the hands-on
stage of maternity, determined to express their disapproval of mothers
today, this book may make some vulnerable mothers more so. I'd like to
see it sold with a robust disclaimer: remember, no-one gets it right
anyway.
Difficulties and dissatisfaction with motherhood, Devlin declares ''a
late twentieth-century predicament''.
Her researches, she says show ''the vast majority of women bringing up
their children between the wars and well into the 1950s and 1960s
accepted their role as wife and mother intuitively, and dedicated their
lives to their husbands and families, with pride and contentment''.
Those for whom married life did not bring ''pride and contentment''
may have been less inclined to answer her advertisement, however. And
words like intuitively, as well as phrases like ''maternal instinct''
and ''innate desire'', beg a few highly contested questions.
There is little sense that these are difficult, emotionally deep-mined
and important issues. Nor that they are highly political: central
questions about the unpaid work of caring, and the low value placed on
it on our society, in practice if not in lip-service, are scarcely
acknowledged.
There have been principles of selection and editing at work,
necessarily, but they are not made explicit. The author hides evasively
behind the material, pretending that this is objectivity. You long for
some shaping purpose beyond the valid, but clearly insufficient,
question: ''What is it like?'' There are no shortcuts to understanding.

If the child of an infamous artist is allowed to inherit the sins of
the parents -- why not the success genes, asks Carole Morin of the
daughter of Sylvia Plath
AN EXHIBITION of oil paintings by an unknown artist in a gallery on
the unfashionable side of World's End has attracted an unusual number of
visitors. Frieda Hughes is known more as daughter than artist. Her
mother is the mythological suicidee Sylvia Plath. After Marilyn Monroe,
American poet Plath is the sexiest suicide of the century.
Ahead of me, in the trek down the New King's Road -- a no-man's land,
like the space in a sixties movie between the Berlin Wall and freedom --
was a group of oriental girls in MAC lipstick who are ''doing The Bell
Jar in school''. One of them giggled, ''We're into all that death stuff.
It's like, you know, real.'' The dark night of the soul's a lot of fun
when you're young. Or, as Al Alvarez (the first critic to recognise
Plath's genius) said: ''Death is a kind of pornography, at once exciting
and unreal.''
Falling into step beside me, a teenage boy said: ''Art galleries are
for w*****s but I just want to see what she's like.'' Frieda Hughes is
-- physically -- like her mother. As Sylvia Plath said, children are ''a
clean slate, with your face.'' Well, not always. Poor Victoria Sellers
seems to have inherited her father Peter's looks and her mother, Britt
Ekland's, brain.
After Sylvia Plath's first breakdown, during what she called the
platinum summer, Sylvia had the fresh face of collegiate America. It was
only later, living in depressing Devon, that the moon face of melancholy
couldn't hide from the camera any longer. Frieda Hughes, at 34, already
three years older than Plath was when she died, resembles the big-boned
girl with blocked pores instead of freckles on her nose, whom Al Alvarez
-- understandably -- didn't fancy.
The schoolboy didn't get a look at Frieda. She wasn't in the Anna-Mei
Chadwick Gallery. ''She's a very driven person; I think she's in
Australia,'' the owner said crossly. Definitely not a substitute mother
figure, Anna-Mei looks like she'd walk for miles to buy the hard paper
they used to put in school toilets.
Frieda Hughes claims not to have read her mother's poetry. Maybe she
hasn't read the remaining Journals either (the ones her father, Ted
Hughes, didn't destroy), and doesn't know that her mother called her
''The Pooker''. From the look of The Pooker's paintings, she's read her
father's poetry. Foxes, wolves, herons, and fruit bats lurk on the
landscape of sinister rustic England.
She admits: ''There's a bit of my father in the subject matter but
that's not intentional.''
The most expensive painting, The Wolf (a snip at #6500), has been
sold. It's easy to sneer that Frieda would be unlikely either to show or
sell her work if she wasn't the daughter of famous parents she refuses
to discuss. And yet who would criticise a surgeon's son for following
his father into medicine? The artist's child is allowed to inherit the
sins of the parents -- why not the success genes?
Children of famous parents have as much right to glory as anyone else.
Some -- like Isabella Rossellini, Dominic Lawson, Michael Douglas, and
Liza Minnelli -- may have used their connections at the start of their
careers, but somehow have to be better than their rivals to succeed. And
for every success story, there's a junkie politician's daughter or
actor's son. It would be wrong to criticise Frieda Hughes for painting
and writing (five children's books). It would be wrong to be kind about
her work because she grew up as a motherless child.
Frieda Hughes's paintings looked dated -- Max Ernst meets Rousseau,
with a (presumably intentional) nursery paintbox execution. They look
how you would expect the daughter of Ted (animal poems) Hughes to paint.
And yet there's a presence to both her and her work. The paintings of
big birds and rooks are almost so bad they're interesting. Is it ''her''
that evokes this unsettling aura, or is it what she's associated with?
It isn't possible or sensible to separate the self from its history.
As she says: ''You are a part of your parents whether you like it or
not.'' She can't be held responsible for other people's obsession with
her mother's suicide and her father's image as an homme fatal,
especially when she goes out of her way not to exploit it. But she can't
avoid either having her indirect place in death culture, even if she
didn't chose it.
Death is one thing that definitely interests everybody. Tilda
Swinton's imitation of a corpse attracted 21,000 voyeurs to the
Serpentine gallery last week. A large man with a chequebook looked at
the pale, serene, sleeping Swinton and asked: ''How much is the dummy in
the case?''
Tilda Swinton was merely impersonating death. Suicide is a way of
controlling death. The suicidee has the last word -- and leaves the
living repulsed, envious, and fascinated.
Fame comes and goes, but some people reach a peak on the fame
spectrum. Once this point has been passed, it's impossible to slip back
into oblivion. Princess Diana is possibly the only woman who could outdo
Plath and Monroe in the death cult war. Monroe had her beauty, Sylvia
her brains, and the alive but sometimes not well Diana has her instinct.
The pouting princess knows how to exploit death culture without dying.
Like Marilyn, she's worshipped as a blonde goddess. Like Sylvia, she's a
wounded mother whose husband was seduced by somebody else. It's easy to
imagine a copy of The Bell Jar face down on Diana's bedside table.
Anything's possible.
It's easy to remember unhappy endings. Some spoilsports claim that
Sylvia Plath's poetry isn't up to much -- she just made it memorable by
sticking her head in an oven like a chicken to be roasted (a macabre
touch in a family apparently obsessed with birds).
Frieda Hughes says: ''You cannot sit on achievement like a rock,
looking at the ocean. You must go beyond it.'' These could be words from
her mother's teenage diaries, spurring her Nietzschean will on. But
where there's a will there isn't always a way.
Autobiography is the best and worst of writing. Plath's art was to
convert apparent autobiography into something both confessional and
mysterious. Unfortunately her daughter's paintings are embarrassingly
artless.
* Frieda Hughes' exhibition is at the Anna-Mei Chadwick Gallery, 64
New King's Road, London (0171 736 1928) until Saturday.
* From next week, Family Extra moves to Mondays.

* EDINBURGH'S multi-faceted Festival Theatre has been many things to
many people since its refurbishment and re-opening last year. One thing
it hasn't served as before, however, is a venue for a fashion show. All
that will change on Thursday as M&amp;S Live -- the Marks &amp; Spencer roadshow
-- rolls into town.
Edinburgh is the only Scottish city hosting the event, which is taking
place at another 18 venues across Britain. There will be two chances, at
6.30pm and 8.30pm, to catch the show which combines choreographed
catwalk, theatre and dance routines as performed by professional models
and dancers, and which spotlights the latest Marks &amp; Spencer collections
of womenswear, menswear and childrenswear. The newest range of home
furnishings will also be on display.
Tickets for the show are #6 each and can be acquired by calling
HomeChoice on 01925 667766 (payment by Account Card, Switch or Delta) or
directly from the customer service desk at Marks &amp; Spencer, Edinburgh. A
guaranteed #10,000 from ticket proceeds will go to the Western General
Hospital Trust Endowment Fund -- Cancer Caring Centre. On Thursday, the
Edinburgh store will stay open until 10pm to allow card customers, and
those attending the 6.30pm show, time to buy whatever caught their eye
during the performance.

A HERBAL ''morning after'' cure aimed at motorists, which claims to
flush alcohol from the bloodstream two-and-a-half hours after heavy
drinking, was roundly condemned last night by police and road safety
campaigners.
Sober-Up, a capsule remedy to be launched in the UK during the
December Christmas party season, will be sold in pub vending machines by
the Merseyside-based company Jonnies.
The firm, which specialises in pub condom sales, claims the product
will reduce blood-alcohol levels by 40% within an hour and clear the
system completely two-and-a-half hours after consumption.
The product costs 50p a dose.
Although Sober-Up's packaging depicts a car driving home in the middle
of the night, the company insists the remedy is intended for ''morning
after drivers'' and not those travelling the same night.
Co-ordinator for Campaign Against Drink Driving, Mrs Maria Cape,
called for the capsules to be banned.
She said: ''The product condones drink driving. The picture of the car
on the packet is appalling. Even if used for the day after, drivers must
learn that any alcohol in the bloodstream the next morning can affect
their perception and be fatal.''
Road safety educator Inspector Kenneth Buchanan, of Lothian and
Borders Police traffic division expressed ''grave personal concern''
about the product: ''There is no guarantee it will be effective and yet
if it doesn't work it could kill.''
Jonnies managing director Maurice Brookes said yesterday that Sober-Up
had been marketed in the US for several years under different names and
had been approved by that country's Food and Drink Authority.
Mr Brookes said he anticipated that the American certification for the
product meant it would not require further testing before it was sold.

MINISTERS in Scotland are to be urged to be less trusting of their
fellow man and more aware of the darker side of human nature.
The lesson will be hammered home by police in a bid to reduce the
growing number of thefts from and vandalism attacks on churches.
A special seminar on the problem has been organised for Scottish
Episcopal clergy and church officers by the Ecclesiastical Insurance
Group, the major insurer of the Church's property, with the blessing of
the Scottish bishops.
The conference on October 21 takes place five months after the rise in
theft and damage suffered by churches of all denominations was
highlighted by the Scottish Office.
The debate at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan will be the
first of its kind in Scotland.
A spokesman for Ecclesiastical Insurance, Mr Brian King, said
yesterday: ''The clergy are not taught to be suspicious of their fellow
man at college. We and the police can give them some advice from the
more suspicious world.
''We thought it was time to help the Scottish Churches stop further
attacks. We have held 40 seminars in other parts of Britain, but this is
our first in Scotland.''
The audience will be told of the dangers of leaving church keys in
''hiding places'' and that thieves do not always look like people
imagine them to look.
Theft and malicious damage suffered by Church properties in Scotland
increased by more than 70% between 1989 and 1993.
In May the Scottish Office produced a booklet listing crime prevention
advice for Church groups.
Father Tom Connolly, Scottish spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church,
said several churches had been fitted with security cameras and alarms.
A Kirk spokesman said: ''Congregations are encouraged to take advice
from their local crime prevention officers to improve the security of
their buildings.''
Strathclyde Police crime prevention officer Inspector John O'Neill,
who will address the seminar, said: ''People have changed their views
about Church property and are willing to take anything that is
unattended. There is a lot of money to be made from the property in
churches.''

HIGH level discussions on the future of the British Aerospace plant at

chief executive Dick Evans.
The MPs, Mr Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame South), Mr George Foulkes
(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley), Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr), Mr Willie
McKelvey (Kilmarnock), and Mr Brian Wilson (Cunninghame South) are
anxious to clear up doubts cast on Prestwick by announcements in the
past few months.
These include a deal being negotiated by BAe and China to build a new
100-seat jet, work on the Future Large Aircraft being developed as a
possible replacement for the Hercules, and implications of the venture
on turboprop planes with Italian/French consortium ATR.
There is also concern over the long term future of production of the
Jetstream 41 turboprop airliner.
There are almost 2000 people employed at Prestwick by the two BAe
subsidiaries based there -- Jetstream Aircraft and BAe Aerostructures.

SCOTS rail travellers will face rocketing fares, which could double in
some cases, and restricted route choices when Britain's train services
are privatised next year.
Passenger watchdog committees are planning to fight planned proposals,
outlined in a 1000-page guide prepared by the 25 train companies and
stipulating the only routes passengers will be allowed to use between
destinations.
If the plans go ahead passengers will not be allowed to travel by
circular routes unless they pay more.
Last night Labour's rail spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, warned: ''This
will be a disaster, a complete nightmare, and something we will
vigorously battle against.''
He added: ''There is likely to be a total explosion in rail fares. You
are talking here of private monopolies taking as much as they can from
the rail travelling public. It will be horrific. It will be a nightmare.
''It is not scaremongering to suggest fares will double and this will
drive people off the railways. It is certainly not the way to develop a
railway system for the 21st century.''
Mr Bill Ure, secretary of the Rail Transport Users Consultative
Committee for Scotland, said: ''This is a retrograde step and we would
resent the withdrawal of the facility to people allowing them to stop
off during their journey. We will be resisting it.''
Labour is already claiming that fares could more than double for
people who want to break their journey.
The party claims that a passenger travelling on a Glasgow-to-London
saver return, at a cost of #72, who wanted to travel home via Sheffield
would have to buy a single ticket from London to Sheffield at #37.50 and
one from Sheffield to Glasgow at #47, more than doubling the present
fare to #156.50.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said: ''The Government has
said all along that the new structure would retain all the benefits of
the pre-privatisation network. That has been blown out of the water. It
is a lunatic proposal.''
He added that he would demand a debate as soon as Parliament returned.
Major General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Rail Users
Consultative Committee, based in London, said the guide had been
produced because of the need to define the income of the 25 companies
into which BR has been split.
He said: ''It's a reduction in the quality of service. It's entirely
for the benefit of the fragmented industry and the apportioning of the
revenues.''
He added that he was also concerned that passengers could face long
delays or higher charges where trains take different routes at differnt
times of the day.
A spokesman for BR said: ''It will be up to the private companies to
set the fares and decide on routes.''
* RAIL passengers who got an unexpected trip to London when their
train driver forgot to stop at Slough will not be compensated, they
learned yesterday.
They were ferried back to Berkshire on another train and finally
arrived at Slough 55 minutes late -- five minutes short of the
qualifying time laid down in the Passengers' Charter.
The forgetful driver of the Cardiff-Paddington express will be
interviewed by Great Western Trains.
A spokesman said: ''It appears that the driver forgot to stop at the
station and instead continued on to Paddington.
''He apologised to his customers aboard the train and we would like to
say sorry to them as well.''
The spokesman added: ''There will not be any compensation because they
were not held up for an hour or more. The Passengers' Charter is quite
clear on the subject of compensation.''

THE son of football club president Mr Harold Petrie, who died after a
''brutal and sustained'' attack during a robbery, yesterday appealed for
help to catch his father's killer.
Mr Petrie, 46, was found lying with stab wounds only yards from
Inverurie Loco Works, the football club ''he lived and died for'' after
his wife, Helen, the club treasurer, had been assaulted and robbed of
around #5000 in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Mr Petrie, described as ''one of the nicest men you could hope to
meet'', may have been murdered as he tried to stop his wife's assailant
from escaping with the club money.
His wife was not injured in the robbery and was able to call the
police. The first two officers on the scene found Mr Petrie lying on
Harlaw Road.
Yesterday, bouquets of flowers, a football club shirt, and ties marked
the spot where he was found dying.
Around 70 officers are involved in door-to-door inquiries and a search
for the murder weapon or any other clues to the killing, which has
stunned the town.
Police confirmed they were looking at the possibility of a link with
an almost identical raid at Cove Rangers FC Social Club in November.
The masked raider in that incident stabbed a club member who went to
the aid of the club steward, who was also stabbed.
It is thought the raider in the latest incident, which took place
after closing time, may also have been masked.
Mr Petrie and his wife had virtually run the club for the past year
and had been clearing up following a disco attended by about 200 people,
which finished at midnight on Saturday. The robbery took place shortly
after 2am.
The couple have a son, Michael, 24, and a daughter Louise, 20. Michael
was on his way home from a night out in Inverurie with a friend when he
saw the police activity outside the club and went to investigate. Inside
the club, his mother and grandfather broke the tragic news to him.
Michael said yesterday: ''The family are devastated. I don't have
words to say how we feel. I just hope they can catch whoever did it and
give him what he deserves.''
He appealed to anyone who might be shielding the killer, who may well
have been bloodstained, to contact the police.
He said his father was not an aggressive man and was well liked in the
community. As well as being deeply involved in the Loco Works football
team, he was a pigeon racer.
Detective Inspector Pat Shearer, who is leading the investigation,
said police were trying to establish the movements of everyone who had
attended the club on Saturday and everyone who was in the area around
the time of the incident.
''There were quite a number of cars still moving around in the
vicinity of the club at the time and we would like to speak to any of
the drivers,'' he said.
''It is very possible that someone, somewhere is shielding the
attacker and has information which may help us. We would appeal to them
to come forward because this was a brutal and sustained attack and we
must track down the person or persons responsible.''
The chairman of the club's executive committee, local baker Mr George
Ross, said the club would remain closed in the meantime as a mark of
respect to Mr Petrie.
''The officials and members of the Inverurie Loco Works FC are all
stunned and greatly saddened by the tragic death of our president,'' he
said. ''Harold was one of the nicest men you could wish to meet. Harold,
along with his wife, Helen, were heavily involved in the running of the
club and put in a tremendous amount of work, far beyond the call of
duty. Harold's contribution will be greatly missed.
''Outside his family, Harold's passion was with Inverurie Loco Works
FC. Indeed, he looked after the club as he would a member of his family.
With true paternal instincts, he cared for the club, was available for
the club whenever help was required, and protected the club.
''Tragically, he died protecting the club he loved so much.''

A FORMER constituency secretary to two Liberal Democrat MPs yesterday
told a court she ''forgot'' about #76,000 of cash assets when she made
three false claims for legal aid.
Mairi Clark, 44, of Onam, Kinnairdie Avenue, Dingwall, was found
guilty after trial of making false statements about her finances when
seeking legal aid on three occasions in 1993 and 1994.
Sheriff Keir Marshall did not impose a fine but ordered her to repay
the #1253 legal aid.
Clark claimed she was ''under considerable harassment'' from her
estranged husband, Michael, when she applied to an Inverness firm of
solicitors for legal aid to institute divorce proceedings and raise an
action against him for breach of interdict.
She claimed on August 12, 1993, that her savings were #4327 whereas
she had #7469 in a building society and nearly #69,000 in an account in
Jersey.
On September 15, 1993, she said her savings were only #200 while she
had the same amount as before in the building society, #60,000 in an
offshore investment account and over #11,000 in her bank account in
Dingwall.
On January 17, 1994, after stating her savings were frozen and failing
to disclose a balance of #8000 in her building society and #54,000 in an
offshore account, she obtained emergency legal aid amounting to #1253.

THE largest investment ever made by an airline in the service it
offers its passengers was launched with a touch of tartan yesterday.
British Airways will spend #500m over the next three years in
improvements to its First and Club World service in a bid to establish
the carrier as the first choice airline throughout the world.
Among the innovations are a specially designed blue-and-white tartan,
patented and registered, which will be used in blankets, pillows, and
mugs in the new cabins.
A #160,000 contract connected with the relaunch of premium services,
the largest ever and being watched closely by the industry, was won by
Bridge of Weir Leather, which will supply hides for the new seats on
Boeing 747, 777, and DC10 aircraft. The company has already supplied
leather for the seats on the British Airways fleet of seven Concordes.
Among the first passengers to experience the new ''cradle'' seats in
Club World class, which offer increased legroom and comfort, will be
those travelling between Glasgow, New York, and Boston.
The return fare for the service to New York, for example, will be
between #3500 and #4000.
The airline is turning the clock back to the heyday of transatlantic
travel by offering 14 individual cabins on its 747 First service, each
of which has a 6ft 6in bed which converts into an armchair.
Personal video entertainment and lighting gives each passenger
complete privacy and control without disturbing others .
British Airways chairman Sir Colin Marshall said: ''This bold
initiative will ensure British Airways' position as the first choice
airline worldwide.''
Virgin boss Mr Richard Branson responded yesterday by offering BA
chiefs holidays on his Caribbean island if their airline could beat his
in business class figures. There was no comment from British Airways
last night.

TWO men who died after their small boat capsized off the coast of a
remote Scottish island were the victims of a tragic accident, police
said yesterday.
Police and coastguards said that the three crew of the 18ft Kes, which
capsized 200 yards from Vaila on the west side of Shetland, accidentally
got their fishing lines tangled in the outboard motor's propellor.
''A mixture of fishing lines fouled around the propellor and the sea
swell was responsible for the accident,'' said Mr Neville Davis,
coastguard district controller for Shetland.
''Even though the weather conditions were not too bad there was quite
a sea running. If anything goes wrong with a boat in those conditions it
can be very dangerous.''
A spokesman for Northern Constabulary described the incident as ''a
tragic accident''.
''We are compiling a report for the Marine Accident Investigation
Branch and it will be up to them whether they want to investigate
further,'' he said.
''But from past experience it appears simply to have been a tragic
accident and will be noted as such.''
Salmon farmer Leif Einarson, 33, was still missing presumed dead
yesterday as the search for his body moved into its second day.
Mr Einarson, a father of two, from Kirkidale, Walls, is believed to
have been thrown into the water when the boat capsized.
Knitwear worker Trevor Blair, 27, also from Kirkidale, was found
attached to the upturned boat by tangled fishing gear early on Sunday
morning after a five-hour search.
The alarm was raised late on Saturday night after the men failed to
return from a three-hour fishing trip.
Mr Blair was married with an 18-month-old daughter.
Mr Blair's brother-in-law, Mr Terry Chapman, 33, of New Road, Walls,
survived the tragedy by swimming ashore.

A SMALL farming community was in mourning yesterday after the death of
a six-year-old girl in a rope swing accident in her garden.
Victoria Crook was found dead by her seven-year-old sister Katie. She
had become entangled in two lengths of nylon rope which made up the
home-made swing.
The incident took place at the back of the family home at Myreton
Farm, Logiealmond, Perthshire, on Saturday afternoon.
Katie ran to tell her parents, William, 43, and Elaine, 34, who had
been picking mushrooms at the front of the house, screaming: ''Mummy,
daddy, I think Vicky's dead.''
Mr Crook made desparate efforts to revive his daughter but she was
confirmed dead on arrival at Perth Royal Infirmary.
Locals in the area around the farm, on a road near Little Glenshee,
were too upset to talk about the death.
Teachers at Logiealmond Primary School, where Victoria was in primary
two, were also too distraught to comment.
The couple, as well as Katie and their other daughter, Alexandra, were
being comforted by friends last night.

Hong Kong, Monday
HONG KONG voters have slapped China in the face by handing a
convincing victory to the pro-democracy camp in the last legislative
polls before the 1997 handover of the colony to Beijing rule.
In the race to elect all 60 members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council
for the first time in 150 years of British rule, the Democratic Party,
whose leaders have denounced by China as subversives, won three times as
many seats as pro-China rivals.
Beijing's standard bearers, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment
of Hong Kong (DAB), were further humiliated by the defeat of its top
guns, party leader Tsang Yok-sing and his two deputies.
However the victory in yesterday's election was not enough to give the
pro-democracy camp a majority in the Legislative Council and the chamber
appeared evenly split between pro-China and pro-democracy forces. The
Democrats won 19 seats while labour, independent, and other probable
allies won another 10 for a total of 29.
The DAB and its close labour allies won eight seats. The pro-business
Liberal Party, which often looks on the Democrats with suspicion, won
10. The balance of independents and small parties are mostly
conservatives or pro-China.
The DAB's poorer than expected performance, however, is expected to
anger China, which repeated its vow to dismantle the legislature when
the British leave and to replace it with an institution of its own
choosing.--Reuter.

Abu Dhabi, Monday
THE United Arab Emirates today defended the death sentence against
Filipina maid Sarah Balabagan, saying the court had enough evidence to
prove she was guilty of the premeditated murder of her Arab employer.
''The court was satisfied with the validity of the charge against the
defendant and was convinced with a clear conscience that she committed
this ugly premeditated crime,'' said the Ministry of Justice.
Working conditions of the hundreds of thousands of foreign maids in
the Gulf are under renewed scrutiny after the UAE court on Saturday
sentenced the 16-year-old to death.
Sarah said her employer was trying to rape her when she stabbed him.
She was originally sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for
manslaughter, but UAE president Sheikh Zaid Bin Sultan al-Nahayan
ordered a retrial.
The court found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to be shot by
firing squad.
In Manila, the Philippine Government tried to calm public anger over
the Balabagan case, warning that flag-burning protests might only harm
efforts to save her life.
Officials at the same time rejected proposals for a ban on the sending
of maids overseas, saying this could have a serious economic backlash
for the country.
''I understand how our countrymen feel but there is a need for calm
and sobriety,'' Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
Solicitor General Raul Goco said burning the UAE flag could boomerang
on Sarah.
''Let us not be very emotional about this,'' he said.
Some Filipino diplomats believed the death sentence might have been
partly spurred by the burning of the UAE flag recently by Filipinos
protesting against the previous sentence.
President Fidel Ramos has said he will personally write to Sheikh Zaid
in an attempt to save the maid from execution. He also ordered her
lawyers to appeal against the verdict before higher UAE courts.
Sarah's plight is the second case of its kind in six months to stir an
emotional outburst in the country.
Filipinos burned Singapore's flags in March after another maid, Flor
Contemplacion, was hanged there for double murder despite Ramos's pleas
for her life.
In other developments today, a Kuwaiti court jailed a woman for 10
years for beating her Sri Lankan maid to death, lawyers said.
The Arab Times newspaper said the accused was the wife of a police
sergeant. It did not disclose her name or nationality, but a lawyer said
she was an Arab.
The woman later asked her husband to help her dispose of the body by
throwing it into the sea, but the husband refused and told the police.
In another incident involving a maid, the family of 24-year-old
Filipina Margaret Almogela, who was allegedly killed by the Iraqi wife
of her employer, accepted #36,000 blood money to drop the charges, the
Kuwait Times reported.--Reuter.

Singapore, Monday
A BRITON dubbed the ''Tourist from Hell'' was a quick learner at
butchery courses, a Singapore court was told today.
Mr John Martin Scripps, who is accused of embarking on a global
killing spree and chopping up his alleged victims' bodies after he
absconded from jail, first did a butchery course at Albany prison on the
Isle Of Wight.
He ''quickly learned the difficult task of de-boning a carcass'', said
prison officer Mr James Quigley, who helped teach a six-week course in
April 1993 which Mr Scripps completed.
Mr Scripps is the first Briton in Singapore to face death by hanging
for the alleged murder of South African brewery engineer Mr Gerald Lowe,
whose body was found chopped up in plastic bags, floating in Singapore
harbour in March.
Mr Scripps, 35, from London, is also wanted in Thailand for the
alleged murder of Canadian Sheila Damude and her 23-year-old son Daren.
Mr Scripps is also wanted in connection with the death of Briton
Timothy McDowall, from South London, in Mexico earlier this year.
According to witnesses, Scripps used his alleged victims' credit
cards.
In Singapore the day after he allegedly murdered Mr Lowe he used the
South African's passport and credit card to withdraw #5600. A shop
assistant claimed he boasted that he spent the night getting drunk at
Singapore's famous Raffles Hotel.
He is also alleged to have bought a video camera and hi-fi speakers.
Prosecutor Jennifer Marie presented 20 boxes of grisly evidence which
filled one side of the court. They included 333 photographs of body
parts.
On a table tools allegedly used by Mr Scripps for the murders were
laid out. They included an electric stun gun, a hammer, handcuffs, a can
of mace spray, and knives.
The prosecutor took five hours presenting statements from 77 witnesses
from Singapore, Britain, Thailand, and South Africa.
A hotel receptionist described how the pair had booked into the River
View Hotel on March 8 and how Mr Scripps said he had kicked Mr Lowe out
of the room after he made a homosexual pass.
A security guard claimed that on March 11 at 6.30am, he watched Mr
Scripps drag a heavy black suitcase out of the hotel only to return
empty-handed 15 minutes later.
Mr Scripps, wearing a blue floral silk shirt, jeans, and black shoes,
sat impassively throughout the hearing.
Police and coastguard officials described their grisly find of Mr
Lowe's body parts floating off Cliffords Pier in Singapore Harbour. When
they checked Mr Scripps's room, they found bloodstains in the bathroom
and on sheets.
Dr Michael John Barber, a British forensic scientist, said in a
written statement that after examining the samples he ''found extreme
support that blood from Lowe's body parts was the same as that found in
the hotel''.
After the statements were read Mr Scripps' lawyer, Mr Edmond Pereira,
said he would give no submissions nor enter a plea.
Mr Scripps spoke only to say: ''I wish to reserve my defence until my
trial.''
After the five-hour hearing, Magistrate Karolyn Gin said there were
sufficient grounds for the accused to face trial for murder and Mr
Scripps was taken to the Taneh Merah top security prison.
The trial is expected to begin early next month.

Srinagar, Monday
KASHMIRI kidnappers who have killed one Western hostage and hold four
others, including two Britons, today claimed that Indian army commandos
had attacked their base in the Himalayas and that they could no longer
ensure their captives' safety.
Meanwhile, officials close to the negotiations said the Indian
Government had offered the rebel group Al-Faran up to 40 million rupees
(more than #800,000) to release the remaining Westerners seized in July.
The militants said in a telephone call to a news agency in Srinagar:
''Indian commandos attacked one of our bases in the Pahalgam area and
there was a gun battle.
''There are casualties, but we don't have the details,'' said the
caller. ''We have reached a conclusion that the government of India is
not keen to get the foreign tourists freed safely.''
However a government spokesman told the United News of India he had no
information about a conflict.
Al-Faran kidnapped six Westerners in early July as they trekked
through the Himalayan mountains. American John Childs escaped, but the
decapitated body of Hans Christian Ostro of Norway was found last month.
The reported ransom would be the first time the government has offered
money for the captives' freedom.
The four captives are Britons Keith Mangan, 33, and Paul Wells, 23;
American Donald Hutchings, 42; and German Dirk Hasert, 26.--Reuter/AP.

Vienna, Monday
FRANCE and China came under fire today for recent nuclear tests when
the United Nations atomic watchdog agency began its annual meeting and
11 nations launched a petition to halt the testing.
Without naming France and China, whose recent nuclear tests have drawn
worldwide rebukes, the group of mostly Pacific nations put forth a
resolution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calling for
a moratorium.
''The general conference deplores the resumption of nuclear tests and
urges those states which have active nuclear testing programmes in place
to desist from testing,'' the resolution said.
It was signed by Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.
The resolution is not expected to get far because key countries such
as the United States and Britain, two of the world's five official
nuclear powers, would not openly criticise France's nuclear policies,
officials said.
Others among the 103 member states attending the conference at IAEA
headquarters in Vienna were also critical of the testing.
''It is most regrettable that nuclear tests are still being conducted
in defiance of a strong global desire for the cessation of testing,''
said Yasuoki Urano, the leader of Japan's delegation.
''Japan emphatically calls for the cessation of all nuclear testing,''
he said to loud applause.
No immediate comment was available from France or China, both of which
have delegations at the week-long conference.
President Bill Clinton, in a statement read to the assembly, did not
mention China or France but said he was committed to a test ban and
nuclear disarmament.
BREST: New Zealanders protesting against French nuclear testing in the
South Pacific sailed yachts into the port of Brest today near the main
base of France's nuclear missile-armed submarine fleet.
The boats sailed near a military area of the port in north-western
France but without venturing to the nearby Ile Longue island where
France's nuclear submarines are based.
Other New Zealanders were in Strasbourg today to meet members of the
European Parliament.--Reuter.

A BULLET passed within 30 metres of British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind's party in Sarajevo yesterday, stealing the thunder of his first
visit to the besieged Bosnian capital.
In a city where getting wounded instead of killed is counted a good
day by many residents, commenting on a bullet which passed 30 metres
distant might be viewed as bad form.
Not so for members of the London press corps travelling with Rifkind,
who know a good story when it goes bang.
Veteran combat cameramen covering the Foreign Secretary were unaware
anything had happened until their agencies began getting calls based on
news stories emanating from London.
UN officials familiar with the incident, which occurred while the
Foreign Secretary was visiting a development project funded by the UK
Government, said the shooting was sparked by a vehicle in the motorcade
which parked in plain view of Serb front lines.
They said a single shot was fired at the vehicle from the Serb side of
the line, after which a UN soldier went to move the car and was himself
fired upon.
That triggered a burst of machine-gun fire at the Serbs from Bosnian
government soldiers in the area, after which the shooting stopped.
''Mr Rifkind was never in any danger and we believe that the entire
incident has been somewhat blown out of proportion,'' said one official.
Mr Rifkind, if he was aware of the incident, appeared unruffled and
continued with his programme.
The Foreign Secretary also visited British peacekeepers in Sarajevo
and met the Bosnian President and Foreign Minister.
The Bosnian government used the opportunity to propose opening a
dialogue with ''responsible'' Serb leaders.
Mr Rifkind welcomed the initiative and said the UK Government would
assist in any way possible.
''I very much welcome the thinking behind it (the government proposal)
and we hope it could provide the basis for an effective ceasefire
throughout Bosnia Herzegovina,'' he told a news conference.
Meanwhile,the deliberate decision by Mr Rifkind to do without a flak
jacket while in Sarajevo was last night described as ''an act of faith''
by the head of a Scots charity who has just returned from a mercy
mission to the city, writes Christopher Reekie.
Dr Denis Rutovitz, chairman of Edinburgh Direct Aid, himself wounded
in the shoulder by a bullet last April, said the front line positions
were ''very dangerous''.
''I think he is a brave man and I salute him,'' he added.

Boksburg, Monday
A SOUTH African police reservist hunting rabbits stumbled over the
body of a murdered black woman and detectives today found the remains of
nine more.
Police commissioner George Fivaz told reporters the first body was
discovered at the weekend on the outskirts of Boksburg, east of
Johannesburg. Searches uncovered the others today.
''All indications are that it is the work of a serial killer,'' he
said. Police believe the first killing took place about a month ago and
the most recent last week.
Violent crime has surged in post-apartheid South Africa. President
Nelson Mandela said recently a serious crime was committed somewhere in
the country every 17 seconds. Another report said there were 55 murders
each day.
Fivaz offered a #91,000 reward for information leading to an arrest
and conviction.
He plans to call in experts from Scotland Yard and the FBI to help in
the hunt.
There were no indications that the women were murdered by the
so-called Atteridgeville Strangler, a serial killer believed to have
killed 15 women and a boy near Pretoria.
In June, a Cape Town judge jailed Norman Afzal Simons for 25 years for
murdering a boy. Police suspect Simons of being the so-called Station
Strangler, who was believed to have murdered 22 people over eight years.
NEW YORK: Former landscape gardener Joel Rifkin, 36, who admitted
killing 17 women and having sex with their bodies before dismembering
them, was today given maximum sentences of 25 years to life for two of
the murders. He is already serving 27 years to life for murdering
another woman.--Reuter.

POLICE hunting the killer of Naomi Smith said yesterday they would
consider wholescale DNA testing of the local community.
Naomi, 15, had her throat slashed and was sexually mutilated last
Thursday just yards from her home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, as she went
to post a letter.
Her body was found by her father, Brian, 47, and her best friend,
15-year-old Emma Jones.
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss said forensic experts would know
within 24 hours whether there was enough information from the scene of
the crime to use in an attempt to identify the killer.
He said: ''If we were fortunate enough to obtain DNA profiles, we
would consider mass screening. We have still to hear whether it will be
possible to profile any particular sample.''
Detectives in Nuneaton have been working with Derbyshire Police, who
hold an index of all murders of children and young people since 1960.
The database is being used to draw up a picture of the killer. More than
300 people have been interviewed by police and 50 detailed witness
statements have been taken.
Mr Bayliss said Naomi's parents had given detectives detailed
statements and were ''supported by my officers over the weekend''. He
added: ''They are now being helped by Victim Support, who will arrange
specialist counselling if required.
''They have gone through several phases of grief and are now in a
quiet period of reflection, coming to terms with their loss.''
Police working on the murder inquiry have still not eliminated a red
Escort car and a spiky-haired man seen running from the scene.
Officers are also looking for three young men seen outside Naomi's
home and near the playground where her body was found.

YACHT owners at a leading marina have been accused of forgetting their
heritage and refusing to welcome one of the world's oldest steam vessels
as it cruises the Firth of Clyde.
A letter from the management of the Largs Yacht Marina to the Scottish
Maritime Museum at Irvine, home of the steam yacht Carola, indicated the
vessel was not welcome because some yachts had been affected by soot and
smoke from its funnel.
The Carola was built at Bowling in the 1890s and was one of the
classic steam yachts of its day.
Mr Jim Tildesley, director of the Scottish Maritime Museum, said: ''It
is a pity that this has happened as we found the Largs Yacht Haven
facilities very useful when in the area and always had the impression
that the management enjoyed having one of the classic yachts of the
golden age of Clyde yachting sitting alongside today's craft.
''We understand the problem which the marina management is having with
their customers but, as far as the yachtsmen are concerned, any damage
that Carola caused would have been of a very temporary nature and a
bucket of water and some soap would have put things right.
''Perhaps on modern yachts you don't swab the decks any more.''
But, after approaches from The Herald, the management at Largs
appeared ready to welcome the vessel back.
Haven Master Bob Jenkins said: ''I think there has been a bit of a
misunderstanding here as the Carola is a welcome visitor and is popular
with berth holders and visitors alike. She is a fine craft and turns
heads wherever she goes.
''On one occasion I understand there was a problem with the engine and
more soot and smoke than usual came out of the funnel. That was a
one-off and I believe it has been sorted out.
''The Carola and her crew are welcome visitors here under normal
circumstances.''

AN industrial tribunal was told yesterday how #43,000 disappeared from
the Clydesdale Bank's Glasgow head office in November 1992 and, seven
months later, following a meeting between a senior bank manager and a
police detective, #3000 was discovered hidden in the bank.
The money was found in June 1993, after bank employee Austen Campbell
allegedly confessed to police about the theft, following the meeting. He
also allegedly told police that he had stolen another #8000 from the
bank in June 1992.
Mr Campbell, of The Auld Road, Cumbernauld Village, is claiming he was
unfairly dismissed by the bank.
The tribunal was told that suspicion for the #43,000 theft fell on Mr
Campbell, who was the last person to handle the money.
Mr Allan Ramsay, 37, a lending services manager with the bank's Credit
Bureau, carried out the investigation into the loss.
He was told on the morning of Thursday, 19 November, 1992, that one of
12 cases -- containing approximately #43,000 -- being transported to the
head office cash centre from the Scottish Exhibition Centre branch had
gone missing two days earlier.
He began to inteview staff at the cash centre, and the first person
questioned was Mr Campbell.
Mr Ramsay said: ''We had been advised Austen Campbell was the member
of staff who had received the money from Securicor.''
Mr Campbell, according to Mr Ramsay, admitted breaching the bank's
guidelines by collecting the money from the Securicor van on his own.
At another interview, Mr Campbell admitted that he bought and sold
cars and, allegedly, admitted lying to the bank when applying for a
personal loan to buy a car.
Mr Ramsay finally prepared his report on the affair late in December
1992, and he told the tribunal: ''We were not able to trace the cash.''
Mr Ramsay admitted that he was unable to rule out any of the cash room
staff as suspects because of the ''general lack of control'' over the
money.
Asked for his opinion on who was responsible, Mr Ramsay said: ''We
considered Austen Campbell was the most likely member of staff to have
been involved.''
He said that Mr Campbell had been dismissed because of his dishonesty
on the personal loan application, and because of a general lack of
confidence in him as a member of the bank's staff, but later, on appeal,
was reinstated.
Mr Colin Campbell, the Clydesdale's audit manager, told the tribunal
how, after meeting Detective Constable Robert Wardlaw at the bank in
June 1993, on another matter, Mr Austen Campbell's name was mentioned.
He then recieved a telephone call from Mr Wardlaw to say there had
been a development and Mr Austen Campbell had confessed to two thefts
from the bank, and also revealed that some money was still hidden there.
Mr Colin Campbell then searched the hiding space in the roof of the
bank toilets and found two #1000 bundles of #10 notes and foreign
currency.
Earlier this year, Mr Austen Campbell was freed by a court after a
charge of stealing #40,000 from the Clydesdale was found not proven.
Mr Austen Campbell, who was sacked after failing to attend a
disciplinary hearing in July 1993, will give evidence today.

<HEADLINE>Report reveals mounting hardship. Students go to soup kitchens</HEADLINE>

STUDENTS who are going hungry because they cannot afford food are
visiting soup kitchens for sustenance, according to the Scottish
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux.
In a report on growing financial hardship among under-graduates and
post-graduates published today, the association gives details of a
student who visited a citizens advice bureau in Lothian region for debt
counselling.
He had taken out a student loan and had sought a bank overdraft, but
travelling to arrange his father's funeral had left him penniless.
At his institution he had asked for help from its access fund --
designed to give financial assistance to students suffering great
hardship -- but it had been exhausted.
''When the client visited the bureau he had no money for the weekend
and had not eaten for two days. The client seemed to have approached all
possible sources of finance but none was available. The bureau gave the
client a list of places providing free food for the needy,'' the report
states.
It concludes that ''debt is a live issue for almost every student''.
Based on recent data, it shows that students without private means are
left with about #20 a week to spend on food, heat, books, and travel
after paying rent.
Weekly student income from maintenance grants and student loans rises
significantly when it covers a 38-week academic year rather than a full
calendar one, but the association points out that most students live in
private tenancies and must pay rent for 52 weeks to hold on to flats.
It says that more than 75% of students struggle to get by on a limited
income from maintenance grant and student loans, which are being
equalised in terms of their value to ease the pressure on the public
purse.
The remainder manage to secure part-time work which provides them with
badly-needed funds. But the association said: ''While the Government has
made clear that the availability of student grants and loans are to be a
contribution to a student's living expenses, it is difficult to see how
these funds can be supplemented.''
As access to higher education is opened up, more students are coming
from poorer backgrounds. But the report says their parents are coming
under pressure because they cannot make contributions to their
children's maintenance, and their offspring are unlikely to be able to
borrow money from them.
Matters are no better for mature students aged 21 and over, or for
students with families or who are single parents, says the report.
The association argues that barring the vast majority of students from
receiving state benefits and recently removing the allowance for mature
students add up to a bleak financial prospect which is leading more
young people and adults to reject higher education as an option.
''While students should not have to rely on benefit, it is difficult
to see how they can afford to make the investment in their own higher
education required when all the odds are stacked against them,'' it
said.
Ms Lin McLean, of the student advisory and counselling service at
Strathclyde University in Glasgow, said the report's findings were in
line with the results of a survey from university heads which suggested
that a 30% rise in drop-out rates had been caused by financial pressures
on students.
She said: ''A student graduating in 1997 after a four-year Scottish
honours degree will be paying back the student loan at #100 a month for
five years.''

A PENSIONER who supplied drugs to children was jailed for nine months
yesterday.
Two youngsters at a children's centre in Inverness had admitted going
to the home of 68-year-old George Wilson to buy cannibas.
Police later found four camera film containers filled with wrapped
pieces of cannabis, weighing a total of 19 grammes.
Inverness Sheriff Court heard diaries containing cash figures and
comments, scales, and more than #200 were found in the house, in Upper
Kessock Street, Inverness.
Questioned by police during the search, Wilson said: ''A couple of
nine-year-olds came by wanting some but I chased them away.'' However,
in a taped interview with police, he admitted supplying 14 and
15-year-olds from his house.
Wilson admitted supplying cannabis at his home between September 4 and
October 4 last year. Sheriff William Fulton deferred sentence three
weeks ago for background reports. Defence agent Mr David Sutherland
claimed his client had made little or no money from the scheme.

THE Government's refusal to fund public sector pay awards means that
council tax payers in Fife face either an average increase of #70 in
their bills next year or cuts in local services, the new council's
Labour leader has warned.
Mr Alex Rowley said yesterday the non-statutory services which could
be hit include nursery education, concessionary fares, and free home
helps.
He was challenging Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth over his
insistence council staff pay rises must be funded out of ''efficiency
savings''.
In a letter to Mr Forsyth, he said the cost of funding pay awards in
Fife over the last two years had amounted to #12.5m. This meant a direct
transfer of costs from national taxation to a rise in average council
tax of more than #116.
Funding a pay award in line with the current rate of inflation next
year would cost the new unitary council more than #7m, he claimed.
Councillor Rowley also called for councils to be given direct control
over local taxes. At present the Scottish Office controlled 85% of
council budgets and only 15% was raised locally.
The Scottish Secretary's recent claims to be promoting local democracy
and local accountability would only become credible if he returned
control of local taxes to local councils, he said.

SINGER David Bowie is expected to announce his first British tour for
five years this week.
However, fans of such hits as Jean Genie, Heroes, and Let's Dance are
likely to be disappointed as Bowie has refused to play any of his older
songs since 1990.
Instead, on his current US tour Bowie, 48, has bewildered audiences
with a barrage of noise from his experimental new album, Outside -- The
Voyeur of Utter Destruction.
Despite lukewarm reaction from some critics, that is what he is
determined to do when he visits Britain later this year.
Bowie has weaved some older songs into the US sets but the only one
which is really well-known is Man Who Sold The World.
His 1990 Sound and Vision world tour was a reprise of all the hits but
critics said then he had joined the nostalgia industry. A Bowie
spokeswoman denied he had any hard-and-fast policy about songs.
Bowie's single, The Heart's Filthy Lesson, entered this week's record
sales charts at number 35.

LIBERAL Democrat president Robert Maclennan yesterday produced a
barnstorming conference speech which belied his image as, to use his own
words, ''very slightly pedantic'' and ''another nervous lawyer,''
(writes Stephen McGregor)
Mr Maclennan, MP for Caithness and Sutherland, attacked both Labour
and the Tories as he left the conference in no doubt that he believes
his party should continue to set out its own, alternative agenda.
He mocked Tony Blair's Shadow Cabinet team as looking like a ''group
of synchronised swimmers . . . cautious ''till you could scream''.
He said Labour had needed to moderate its views. However, now it
lacked passionate belief and a constructive will to reform.
Election victories came only to those parties not afraid to proclaim
their commitment to reform.
''If Labour wins by sidling in without priorities or commitments, they
will flounder in the marshes. It would be a deserved fate for a party
which betrayed hope.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown was described as a ''sleekit, cowering,
timorous beastie,'' but a great deal of Mr Maclennan's vitriol was
reserved for the Tories.
He said: ''The only powers the Tories have given up willingly are the
powers to regulate scandal. They will not regulate Cedric Brown, they
will regulate no carnivorous utility company.
''With the Tories, less government has meant more power drawn from
local government to Whitehall. Less government has meant more power
drawn from elected bodies to unelected quangos.''

THE North Sea must be protected from pollution and the dumping of
former oil installations, the conference agreed yesterday, (writes
Robbie Dinwoodie).
It backed a strong package of measures proposed by Scottish party
leader Jim Wallace, on the basis that the Brent Spar saga showed that as
long as environmental risks remained there should be strict controls.
Mr Wallace, who spoke with the experience of an MP representing Orkney
and Shetland, said a ''flush and forget'' attitude to dumping in the sea
should be consigned to history.
''The Greenpeace apology this month should be seen as a frank
admission of error in calculating the volume of oil left on the Brent
Spar,'' said Mr Wallace. However, he added that some had made too much
of this.
''To listen to the reaction of the oil industry to the over-the-top
comments of Energy Minister Tim Eggar, you would have thought that
Greenpeace had conceded the whole case for dumping the Brent Spar at
sea. Not a bit of it.''
Mr Wallace argued that if it was unacceptable for ordinary vessels to
dump garbage at sea it could not be acceptable to dump an entire
structure which had no independent inventory of the waste on board and
where there had been a wholly inadequate assessment of the marine
environment involved.
He said: ''If the Brent Spar was to be dumped at sea against that
background of risk, it would be a gross violation of the precautionary
principle and would set a quite unacceptable precedent.
''For too long we have allowed a flush and forget attitude to our seas
involving sewerage, toxic waste and hazardous substances. All have
contributed to the pollution of our marine environment and that attitude
must be consigned to history.''
The conference accepted an amendment to a reference to reducing
pollution from British vessels, deleting the word British to include all
international shipping but it refused to accept a call to delete a
clause banning the dumping of oil installations at sea called for by
some who said this was too dogmatic a position.
There was an intervention in the debate by veteran Liberal activist
Ludovic Kennedy, who suggested that what was missing from the motion
before the conference was recognition that this was precisely the kind
of matter which should be dealt with by a Scottish parliament rather
than by Westminster legislation.

LIBERAL Democrats' economic affairs spokesman Malcolm Bruce won a
lengthy standing ovation from the conference yesterday when he pledged
the party to vote against any tax cuts in this year's Budget and
promised the return of Railtrack to majority public ownership.
With the Government under pressure to produce tax cuts if it is to
have any hope of winning the next General Election, Mr Bruce was clear
that his party would have nothing to do with what would be viewed as a
cynical election tax bribe.
Mr Bruce announced the launch of a Liberal Democrat petition -- forms
were placed on every seat in the conference hall -- aimed at making
education this year's Budget priority.
The Liberal Democrats have said they are prepared to put 1p on income
tax to fund further spending on education, and yesterday it was clear
the policy had the overwhelming backing of party members.
Mr Bruce said: ''My message to Kenneth Clarke today is that long-term
investment in education must come before cynical short term bribes, and
lower interest rates should come before higher borrowing.
''Tax cuts cannot be right when public borrowing is heading for almost
#30bn this year. Each income tax payer in this country is already paying
almost #1000 per year interest on our Government's accumulated debts.
That is the Tories' tax bombshell.''
Mr Bruce said the obsession with short-term tax cuts left most people
cold, and argued that irresponsible tax cuts now now would endanger the
prospects for lower interest rates, which both hard-pressed homeowners
and business urgently needed.
He told the conference: ''Sound fiscal policy could bring down
interest rates by one or even two per cent -- but it will not happen if
irresponsible tax cuts take place instead.
Mr Bruce restated the party's backing for an independent UK reserve
bank, European monetary union and a single currency.
''Only we can be trusted on tax. Vote Conservative and you are in for
the tax bombshell of low growth. Vote Labour and you're signing a blank
cheque on taxation.
''Vote Liberal Democrat and you get no promises without the bill
attached, no taxation without explanation and no more asked of from you
until we have demonstrated that government can do with less.''
The Liberal Democrats' line meant that it would vote against tax cuts
in this year's Budget, and on a day of tension between the Liberal
Democrats and Labour, Mr Bruce issued a challenge to Labour leader Tony
Blair: ''If you really want co-operation, then join with us in the
lobbies and vote for our children's future.''
On the future of the railways, Mr Bruce said there could be no better
example than railway privatisation of dogma, not logic, determining
policy.
''Railway privatisation is the bridge, tunnel and track too far for
this Government. Make no mistake. This would not be private enterprise,
it would be the biggest privately-owned lame duck ever created.
Dependent for ever on public hand-outs but accountable first to private
shareholders. It would be higher fares for the many and higher salaries
for the few.''
* During a debate on transport, party spokesman Paul Tyler said no
sane investor would put money into the sell-off of Railtrack if it was
made clear that an in-coming government would take back a controlling
51% stake.
If Mr Blair would give the nation just one straight promise for once,
''the threat of a successful sell-off of the rail network before polling
day would be halted in its tracks'', Mr Tyler said.
He warned the privatisation would derail plans for a coherent network
attracting more passengers and freight.
He claimed a ''war of attrition'' had started over the sell-off, with
services being cut in the winter passenger timetable which comes into
effect later this month.

THE deal struck recently by the Liberal Democrats' Scottish leader Jim
Wallace and Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson over
plans for a Scottish parliament will come under scrutiny at the
conference today (writes Stephen McGregor).
This agreement produced a joint declaration that they supported a
parliament of 129 MPs, to be elected by a form of proportional
representation, breaking what was seen as a deadlock in discussion of
the issue.
The motion for this morning's debate commends the Scottish party on
the progress made in recent weeks within the Scottish Constitutional
Convention towards the final establishment of a scheme for a Scottish
parliament.
However, Labour is criticised for its retreat from proposing elected
assemblies for the regions of England, and for the ''endorsement by the
Labour Party in Wales of unfair, first-past-the-post voting in its
watered down plans for a Welsh Assembly.''
The Tories also are criticised for their ''rejection of any
significant constitutional development, except in the proposals for an
assembly for Northern Ireland.''
The debate is being seen largely as a rubber-stamping exercise for the
agreement reached between Mr Robertson and Mr Wallace -- an example of
the two parties working together -- but there may be some signs of
discontent from the conference floor because some activists feel there
has not been enough consultation.
Mr Wallace said yesterday that it was a matter of regret that neither
the SNP nor the Tories had come into the Convention and now were sniping
from the sidelines. He said it would have been better if everyone had
been able to be constructive.
Party president and Caithness and Sutherland MP Bob Maclennan, in a
swipe at Labour, said: ''A parliament for Scotland 'Yes,' but to make no
change in Scottish representation in Westminster is to butter your
bannock on both sides and it simply isn't on.
''An assembly for Wales with the old voting system entrenching
minority rule? That will not do. Nor will regional talking shops for
councillors dressed up as regional government. The truth is that we know
the shape of reform, but those who favour it must get the detail right
if it is to reach and stand secure on the statute book.''
* As he welcomed the conference's 1500 representatives to the city,
Glasgow's Labour Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall skirted around any direct
remarks about his party's relationship with the Liberal Democrats.
However, Sir Russell Johnston, MP for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber,
could not resist a dig at Labour when he replied.
''I don't know if you are old Labour or new Labour,'' he told Mr
Dingwall. ''Our problem is that we aren't quite sure how far beneath the
skin the difference goes.''

SENIOR republican and loyalist politicians shared a platform in
Glasgow last night, having been brought together through the efforts of
the Liberal Democrats and the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland,
(writes Robbie Dinwoodie).
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin and Ulster Democratic Party
leader Gary McMichael sat on either side of the Liberal Democrats'
Northern Ireland spokesman Lord Holme in what is believed to be the
first such public reconciliation since the ceasefire started over a year
ago.
Although neither side gave anything away in terms of its policy
positions, Liberal Democrat organisers said the mere fact of their
coming together at a conference fringe meeting was encouraging for the
peace process.
They were joined on the platform of a packed meeting by Dr John
Alderdice, the Alliance Party leader, and a political scientist from the
University of Ulster, Professor Paul Arthur.
Lord Holme said earlier that he had kept the Government informed of
the intention to bring together representatives of the political wings
of the IRA and UDA and there had been no objection.
Mr McLaughlin told the meeting that the obstacle to peace came from
the British Government, which continued to pursue by various means the
military victory over the IRA which had eluded them for 25 years, and
added: ''Is decommissioning of weapons so critical that the cessation of
hostilities should be threatened?''
Mr McLaughlin expressed caution with the way things were going.
He said: ''We do not yet have peace, we do not yet have peace talks
and no one can be confident that we will ever have peace talks.''
Mr McMichael pointed out that his own father had been murdered by the
IRA, but he said that everyone in Northern Ireland had the right to seek
self-determination and Sinn Fein had the right to argue its case.
However he insisted that it had to make a start on decommissioning and
said: ''Sinn Fein must find a way to prove they are committed to
peaceful means. No one is asking the IRA to surrender, merely to engage
in a process of decommissioning.''
Dr Alderdice said that one year on, those who felt most elated by the
ceasefire now felt most depressed by the stand off. He said most people
in Northern Ireland did not care about the terms talks, substantive
talks or formal negotiations, they just wanted their leaders to get on
with it.
Lord Holme afterwards described the meeting it as ''good''.

THE Liberal Democrats yesterday backed a plan to switch benefit
payments from the unemployed to employers to provide an incentive for
firms to take on jobless people.
However, some representatives complained that the proposal to tackle
long-term unemployment was not radical enough.
Liberal Democrat Employment spokesman David Chidgey, introducing the
motion, said: ''Long-term unemployment is creating division in our
society and we must set an agenda to create social cohesion.''
THE conference yesterday endorsed moves to establish a Bill of Rights
for disabled people. Representatives voted unanimously to adopt the
Access for All disability policy paper. This would enforce a quota-levy
system to penalise businesses which do not fill their quota of disabled
employees and institutionalise civil rights for disabled people through
a Human Rights Commission. Liberal Democrat spokesman on disability Liz
Lynne MP said the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill had been
''too little, too late''.
BIG cuts in vehicle excise duty for low-powered cars were demanded by
the Liberal Democrats in a bid to cut pollution.  The conference backed
a motion to reduce the tax from #135 to as little as #5 for cars below
1500cc.  Coupled with higher taxes on petrol, the aim would be to
encourage people to switch to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.

TEN demonstrators were arrested yesterday following a protest at
Dundee's Ninewells Hospital by the Campaign Against Hospital Cuts and
Closures.
Demonstrator Philip Stott said: ''We are taking the anger of the
people of Dundee right to the doorstep of the unelected bureaucrats who
are destroying our NHS.'' A Tayside Police spokesman said: ''Ten people
have been charged following an incident.''

GOLFER Nick Faldo's manager yesterday denied that the European Ryder
Cup team member was divorcing his second wife Gill.
Mr John Simpson said: ''Nick and Gill are not getting divorced. I find
the whole thing extraordinary. All Nick is concentrating on at the
moment is winning back the Ryder Cup.''
Mrs Faldo, 37, was angered by the newspaper speculation as she flew
from London's Heathrow airport with the European team to join her
husband, already in America.
Looking tearful and upset, she told reporters: ''I have absolutely no
comment to make.''
The golfer's manager hit out at the media for running stories saying
that the Faldo marriage of nine years was on the rocks. The Sun led the
field with an exclusive headlined ''Faldo's #10m divorce shocker''.
He said: ''There is not a direct quote from Nick or Gill in any of the
stories. I don't know where they came from. All I can say is that Nick
and Gill are not getting a divorce.''
European captain Bernard Gallagher said he did not think the publicity
about Nick's marriage would affect the team's chances of wresting the
Ryder Cup from the Americans this weekend. The three-day tournament is
being staged in Rochester, New York State.
''Gill's going on the plane and we're delighted she's going. Nick's
already in the US and will be arriving in Rochester at the same time as
we do.''
He conceded the pressure of playing top level golf did put a strain on
marriages. ''History proves it does,'' he said. ''They do spend a lot of
time away.''
The Faldos married in 1986, after his first marriage, to former sports
journalist Melanie, ended in 1984, after five years. She blamed the
pressure of touring as the main reason for the break-up.
The Faldos, whose home is in Surrey, have three children, Nathalie,
nine, Matthew, six, and two-year-old George.
Mrs Faldo has helped build her husband's businesses, and is a director
of Nick Faldo International. It is estimated he earned #4m last year.
Faldo has recently suffered a loss of form, and has dropped from No 1
in the world rankings to No 3.

A HIT-and-run driver who mounted the pavement and ploughed into three
men was fined #75 yesterday. At Dumbarton Sheriff Court Robert Jennings,
32, of Hall Street, Renton, Dunbartonshire, admitted careless driving
and failing to stop. He said he had panicked.
His pleas of not guilty to the more serious charge of dangerous
driving and one of assault were accepted by the Crown. Of the three
victims, one was treated for multiple fractures in Glasgow's Western
Infirmary.

THE Scottish Football League (SFL) has warned bookmakers they could
have their licences withdrawn if they take bets on the possibility of
Rangers footballer Paul Gascoigne being sent off during the first Old
Firm match of the season tonight.
The SFL said yesterday it was not aware of any specific cases of such
bets for tonight's game, but some Glasgow bookmakers had come up with a
series of novelty bets, including a 16-1 bet on Gascoigne being
red-carded twice before Christmas.
An SFL spokesman said: ''There were a couple of bookmakers offering
bets of this nature. We have contacted the bookies concerned and told
them we found this type of bet wholly unacceptable.
''Obviously, taking bets on any player being sent off, and not just
Paul Gascoigne, can have serious ramifications, not least for
referees.''
The spokesman added: ''We warned the bookies that we have the power to
withdraw licences from them which we issue at the start of each season.
And, if the offence is serious enough, we could withdraw the licence
immediately.''
A spokesman for John Smith bookmakers said: ''We will not take bets on
any player being sent off for any game.''
Coral bookmakers have made Rangers favourites for tonight's game. They
are 6-4, while Celtic are 13-8.

A 1994 AUDI 2.3-litre Cabriolet used by the Princess of Wales sold at
auction yesterday for #23,000 -- about #6000 more than its forecourt
value.
The emerald green car -- registration number L449 TRP -- with cream
leather interior, sports steering wheel, and multi-play CD stacker --
was loaned to Princess Diana last year and featured in hundreds of
photographs.
A 1981 Ford Escort, given to the princess by the Prince of Wales
before they were married, went for #4600 -- as much as it cost new.
The Audi was bought by an anonymous Singapore investment banker who
intends to keep the car at his London home close to the princess's
residence at Kensington Palace.
The princess has now bought a dark blue, 2.6-litre Audi.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair moved to quash rumours of a split with his
deputy John Prescott by telling his Shadow Cabinet yesterday he will
respond to his critics with a detailed list of policy commitments in his
address to party conference next month.
He dismissed as ''silly'' persistent suggestions that he has offended
Mr Prescott after excluding him from a number of strategy discussions
attended by Mr Blair's close aides, who have been criticised by the left
of the party for being unelected and too right-wing.
Mr Prescott's supporters within the party are said to be dismayed by
the extent to which decision-making, in particular on Labour's General
Election strategy, has become centred on a small group of Mr Blair's
advisers who are considered unsympathetic to some of Labour's
traditions.
But yesterday Mr Blair praised Mr Prescott for his role in helping to
secure victory for the leadership earlier this year in its campaign to
change Clause 4 of the party constitution.
Mr Blair said: ''You should remember it was John Prescott and I who
put through the biggest change in the Labour Party's constitution in
history. That is the best testament I can put.''
Personality issues had no place in the work of the Shadow Cabinet, he
said, while his office pointed out Mr Prescott has been asked to make
the crucial speech winding up the conference.
''People are not interested in tittle-tattle. What they want to know
about a Labour Government is what it is going to do about the economy,
education, the health service, crime, and law and order on our
streets,'' Mr Blair said.
''Whatever noise is going on off-stage is not going to deflect us from
that because that is the people's agenda and that is what the people
want to be able to hear.''
Mr Blair told a meeting of the Shadow Cabinet, called to finalise
plans for the conference, that he would use his speech to define his
vision of new Britain.
''New Labour was never going to be enough. It's new Britain that
matters. This conference is about the kind of specific commitments we
are going to make, honour, and carry through in government,'' he said.
A Labour source said afterwards that Mr Blair's speech would contain
''specific policy commitments in key areas'', but that he would stick to
Labour's policy of making no pre-election spending commitments that
might be seized on by the Tories.
The Shadow Cabinet also listened to a polling presentation which
suggested that despite a string of summer setbacks, in which party
members attacked Mr Blair for modernising too fast, the party remains in
the position it was at the beginning of the summer.
Earlier, Mr Blair ridiculed suggestions that he was prepared to offer
Shadow Social Security secretary Donald Dewar the post of Labour Chief
Whip in his anticipated reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet.
He told a London press conference yesterday: ''No decisions have been
taken on who is the Chief Whip. That is one of the many stories giving
me cause for amusement this morning.''
Mr Blair is to meet representatives of Scottish business and industry
in Edinburgh as part of a nationwide tour aimed at improving the party's
image with a sector that is traditionally suspicious of its policies.
The initiative, dubbed the ''bacon and eggs offensive'', echoes
Labour's ''prawn cocktail offensive'' before the 1992 General Election,
when MPs embarked on a round of meetings in the City to ease doubts
about the effects of Labour's tax plans.
Mr Blair, along with Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, Shadow Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who chairs the party's National Policy Forum, and
Shadow Trade and Industry secretary John Cunningham, will tour the
country to meet business leaders and hear their concerns.
This week he will address 600 businessmen and women in Birmingham, and
a similar number in Crawley. His visit to Edinburgh is expected in the
late autumn.
Labour will publish a White Paper next year on its plans for business,
based on what it hears during the tour.

A NEUROLOGICAL consultant who allegedly flew into a rage after finding
his car boxed in at a car park was found not guilty yesterday of breach
of the peace and vandalism.
Dr Goran Jamal, 42, who works at the Southern General Hospital in
Glasgow, was acquitted at the end of the second day of his trial at
Bearsden and Milngavie District Court. His wife, Vian, 33, a pathologist
at the Royal, was also found not guilty of breach of the peace.
The couple hugged briefly before leaving court. Dr Jamal told
reporters they were pleased with the result. The case, he added, had not
been necessary. ''However, justice has been done,'' he said.
The court had heard from Mrs Pamela Baird, of Morven Road, Bearsden,
that the Jamals had subjected her and her four-year-old daughter to a
terrifying experience after wrongly accusing her of boxing in his car
last year at the Glebe car park in Bearsden.
Mrs Baird alleged that Dr Jamal, of Camstradden Drive West, Bearsden,
had been abusive, bullying and intimidating. He had told her he had
called the police and that she must wait for them to come. As she began
to drive away he had smashed her windscreen with his fist.
She alleged that Mrs Jamal had also been very angry and that she had
repeatedly banged on the bonnet of her car.
Yesterday, however, Dr Jamal challenged Mrs Baird's and other
witnesses' version of events.
He told defence solicitor William Macreath that Mrs Baird had been
patronising towards him. He told her he had telephoned the police and
that she should wait until they arrived. At this time he put his hand on
the car door. ''She shut the door trapping my hand. I was in
excruciating pain.''
As Mrs Baird started to reverse he began banging on her windscreen
with his left hand to let her know that his right one was trapped. His
wife rushed forward and started thumping Mrs Baird's bonnet, again to
let her know of his predicament.
Mr Macreath asked: ''Did you swear?'' Dr Jamal: ''Absolutely not.''
He said that by this time he and his wife were shouting to each other
in Kurdish. She told him to pull his hand free and he managed to do so.
Ms Waldron put it to him that the injury to his hand might have been
self-inflicted to explain his behaviour. Dr Jamal replied: ''I do not
accept that.''
Dr Patrick Grant, accident and emerency consultant at the Western,
told the court that he had seen Dr Jamal about two-and-a-half hours
after the incident. The injuries were consistent with his fingers being
crushed between two firm surfaces, Dr Grant said.
Asked whether they could be consistent with a fist striking a car
windscreen, Dr Grant replied: ''I would not have said so.''
Returning his verdict, magistrate William Dudgeon told the Jamals that
he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they had committed the
offences.
Last night Mrs Baird, who was not in court, said: ''I feel quite
outraged by the verdict.''

ALL negative cervical cancer slides should be double-checked for
accuracy, a Scottish Office report on quality control in laboratories
recommended yesterday.
A committee of experts said that random one-in-10 sampling --
traditionally used in many laboratories -- was a meaningless way of
monitoring error rates.
Instead, it recommended that each slide judged negative in the first
instance should be given a 30-second rapid re-scan by another
cytologist.
These rapid reviews should be carried out first thing in the morning
''when eyes are fresh'' before starting on the new day's workload.
Slides judged unsatisfactory -- obscured or with inadequate material --
should also be dealt with in this way.
The 10-member working party was set up to report on internal quality
control for cervical cytology laboratories in the wake of the problems
at Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock, when 20,000 slides had to be
reviewed after deficiencies were found in the laboratory there.
Medical experts from both sides of the Border sat on the committee,
whose recommendations are expected to be taken up throughout the UK.
Cervical cancer kills about 1800 women in Britain every year and the
report says 90% of invasive squamous cervical cancer can be avoided
among those who are regularly screened.
About 80% of the eligible population take part in the programme.
The report makes clear that no screening programme can provide 100%
protection from disease and that public expectations of perfection are
unrealistic.
''Health education programmes should state this explicitly,'' it said.
''The interpretation of cervical smears is a subjective assessment of
minor variations of cell colour, shape, size, and density, in which some
diversity of opinion is inevitable.
''However, this in no way diminishes the responsibility of service
providers to ensure that the programme meets, and preferably exceeds,
defined standards.''
Although guidelines were available from professional bodies, the
absence of absolute standards had handicapped the committee's work.
It said: ''It is the task of professioal bodies to set and review such
standards, and of purchasers to ensure their inclusion in service
specifications.''
The report was launched yesterday by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth at the British Society for Clinical Cytology's annual scientific
meeting in Crieff, Perthshire.
He said: ''Implementation of the recommendations of this report will
result in significant improvements in the quality of the service
provided.''
The working party acknowledged that implementing its report would
increase costs but could not say by how much, since it would vary from
laboratory to laboratory.
Some may already have adopted most of the recommendations but for
others the cost implications might be significant.
However, it considers this is justified by the improved service to
patients, the savings in cost of expensive look-back exercises of the
type that had to be carried out at Inverclyde, and savings in other
areas, such as repeat tests and unnecessary referrals.
Dr Alistair Robertson, consultant pathologist and clinical director of
the Department of Pathology at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, and a member
of the working party, said: ''I think we in Scotland can be quietly
confident that most laboratories are complying with most of the
recommendations.
''However, all laboratories will have to re-examine their procedures
in the light of this report. One big change that will affect a number of
labs is the change in the method of checking. In the past, we did a 10%
sample -- now we are recommending 100%.''
''We have to ensure that we have the highest quality of staff. This
report should not be seen in isolation from the external quality control
measures that are already in place, which ensure that all staff involved
in reporting on smears undergo a proficiency test twice a year.
''One of the report's most important messages is that screening cannot
be 100% effective. There will always be the occasional woman who has a
negative smear and goes on to develop cancer.
''That means that any woman who has had a negative smear and then
develops symptoms should have them seen to, and not assume that it can't
be cervical cancer.''
Labour's Scottish spokesman on health, Mr John McAllion, said: ''If
this is the best advice of the experts, and the Government is going to
implement it, then obviously that is welcome.
''But they can't run away from the resource implications. You can't
provide high-quality public services by cutting resources,'' added the
MP for Dundee East.
The report main recommendations are:
* Clear, documented lines of accountability in laboratories, with
someone explicitly responsible for quality control.
* Contractual responsibility for the consultant in charge to deliver a
service to an agreed specification.
* Standard operating procedures should be documented for every
laboratory process.
* Laboratory procedures should be routinely monitored.
* One or two individuals should supervise technical and clerical
procedures.
* All laboratories should be computerised, with electronic transfer of
results to health boards, and software to record internal quality
control. In the meantime, those which are not must maintain efficient
manual records.
* Slides and documentation on IQC should be retained for at least 10
years.

TWO stark warnings from the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of
England have highlighted the desperate Whitehall battle on state
spending and borrowing -- a struggle still unresolved.
The prospect of tax cuts in the November 28 Budget receded yesterday
as Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was obliged to issue figures which left him
#700m short on his target to reduce the colossal government borrowing.
This is central to his room for manoeuvre on both interest rates and
reduction in taxation.
Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, underlined the
Chancellor's dilemma for his Budget. The borrowing rate should remain at
6.75% in the circumstances, he said in Manchester. A reduction might
also threaten increased inflation.
Mr Clarke who is struggling with his Cabinet colleagues to find real
cuts in the #300bn public expenditure, took the first step yesterday in
remedial measures. He announced that public sector workers must be
constrained to pay rises next year below the level of inflation and that
more efficiencies must be produced to meet this.
To ram the message home to his Cabinet spending colleagues, he made it
clear the Government's contingency reserve fund cannot be raided to
finance pay settlements in the public sector.
The two statements signal a truce in the two men's dispute over the
last three months about interest rates.
Mr George now concedes Mr Clarke was right in refusing his demands for
an increase in the borrowing rate for both business and individuals.
He told Manchester businessmen: ''I understand the current
uncertainties, the patchiness of the economy with important sectors
still struggling, having so far been hardly touched by the expansion.
''I understand the wider fears of a more general slow-down in output
and employment growth, and I understand the temptation to look for more
stimulus in the short term.''
Such a stimulus has been rejected by the Cabinet as recently as last
week at its special political strategy meeting. State borrowing is still
too high and is likely to keep interest rates from being cut.
In the approach to the Tory Party conference in Blackpool next month,
when the Prime Minister hopes his colleagues can orchestrate a Tory
revival, yesterday's figures were a setback.
Furthermore, the Chancellor's edict yesterday on public sector pay
provides Mr Blair with ammunition to attack a continuing policy which
affects workers from nurses to High Court judges. Mr Clarke insisted the
pay review bodies must make their assessments on ''an affordable
basis''.
Corporation tax receipts next month may redress the balance of public
sector borrowing, but the figures issued jointly yesterday by the
Treasury and the Central Statistical Office revealed the Government had
to borrow #4600m to plug the gap between its spending and income in
August. It took the cumulative PSBR for the first five months of the tax
year to #16.7bn, #700m more than the same period last year.
The shortfall was much bigger than the #3500m expected.

<TEXT>
SIAMESE twins Chloe and Nicole Astbury were last night ''doing very
well'' after an 11-hour life-saving operation which left doctors
uncertain over their future.
Surgeons at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, decided to operate on the
girls to separate a shared bowel after tests and scans showed their
lives were at risk.
Last night, the girls' parents, Melanie, 25, and Brian, 26, were said
to be bearing up well after the ordeal of waiting for the results of the
marathon operation on their daughters.
''The only way I can describe how they feel is to say relief,'' said
family solicitor Ms Andrea McWatt.
''The hospital tonight say the girls are stable and as well as can be
expected. It is unbelievable how they have come through after 11 hours
in surgery.
''They are both tough little ladies and have come through it all.''
Cards, flowers, and messages have continued to pour into the hospital
from around the country -- many of them from strangers.
The medical team caring for the girls admitted the surgery on Sunday
had raised questions over what they hoped would be a future operation to
separate the twins, born on Thursday last week.
Scots surgeon Mr Alan Dickson said: ''The extent of the bowel damage
is a disappointment to us. Clearly, this has implications for the future
but I am not prepared to speculate on that.''
The babies were on ventilators last night and will have to remain on
drip feeds for up to one year. Mr Dickson said they had lost a
significant part of their upper bowel. But he did say he was still
''cautiously optimistic'' about the future.
Doctors discovered during surgery that the liver and bowel were the
only organs shared by the girls.
But Mr Dickson said: ''The liver join is very complicated. The whole
join is very complicated.''
The decision to operate was made on Saturday night because the twins'
bowel was obstructed and there was a risk of a fatal perforation.
The problems probably arose half-way through Mrs Astbury's pregnancy
as a result of the two babies' bowel being loose and able to wrap
themselves around each other.
Mr Dickson said the operation was performed without losing any more of
the bowel than had already been damaged.
He said what the medical team discovered about the extent of the join
in the twins' liver during the operation meant separation of it would be
a ''surgical challenge''.
Mr Dickson said of the twins: ''We have some concerns, certainly in
the short term. These children have lost a very significant part of the
upper part of the bowel. This will have implications for their
nutrition. How long for is pure speculation.
''But we are pleased with the twins' present situation and hope they
make a recovery.''

UNITED Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said yesterday
UN troops in Bosnia should be replaced by an international coalition
whether or not current efforts lead to a peace accord.
His comments signalled the first step towards sending a Nato-led force
to the war-torn country.
In a letter to the Security Council, Mr Boutros-Ghali said that if a
peace agreement were concluded he would propose that it authorise ''an
ad hoc coalition of member states'' acting with appropriate regional
organisations to implement such a plan.
Equally, if the current US peace initiative does not succeed and the
council takes more ''enforcement action'', he would recommend the
31,000-strong UN force be replaced.
He did not specify the multinational force but it was clear he had
Nato in mind.
''In either case urgent action would be required to prepare for an
expeditious handover by UN Protection Force to the multinational force
that would be established by member states so authorised by the
council,'' he said.
His comments came as British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind left
Bosnia having failed to convince leaders to halt military offensives in
western Bosnia that threaten to end peace moves and create a
humanitarian disaster.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey had offered a surprise
initiative of talks with moderate Serb leaders over the fate of the
stronghold of Banja Luka.
Despite an urgent call from the UN Security Council for an immediate
halt to the fighting, the Bosnians said offensives would continue.
Mr Boutros-Ghali also pointed out yesterday that the UN had a limited
capacity to manage large-scale operations, particularly those using
force, and noted again the failure of member states to pay peacekeeping
contributions on time.
He said there were difficulties in ''co-ordinating the operations of
military personnel and civilian personnel with different mandates and
different chains of command''.
However, he said the UN could still play a useful peacekeeping role in
Croatia and in Macedonia. The Croatian operation of 14,000 troops is
currently being reduced to 2500 and Macedonia has about 1100
peacekeepers.
There was no immediate concrete reaction from council members.

A WOMAN boss branded ''a bully'' has won an industrial tribunal case
raised by her secretary.
The secretary, Mrs Sheila McKerron, told the tribunal that career
woman Karen Stewart, 33, was ''bullying, dominant, guilty of blame
transference'', and treated her like an office junior.
But yesterday, mother of three Mrs McKerron, 48, lost her claim for
unfair dismissal against her boss's organisation, The Quality Scotland
Foundation, which promotes ''quality management'' among more than 100
top Scottish companies and is aiming to recruit several hundred more.
Mrs McKerron also complained her boss referred to her as ''McKerron''
instead of by her first name, or calling her Mrs McKerron.
Mrs Stewart hit back by claiming that the secretary she hired for her
pleasing personality made mistakes, and that when they were memoed she
was aggressive and abusive.
Mrs McKerron was finally sacked by Edinburgh-based Quality Scotland
chief executive David Justice, only four months into the job, after the
secretary ignored a suggestion by him that she take a few days off work
to allow the situation in the small, two woman office in Inverness to
cool down. Instead she continued working.
''I was absolutely flabbergasted at being sacked,'' Mrs McKerron told
the Inverness tribunal.
She was unable to take Quality Scotland, who are involved in the
''Investors in People'' scheme, to the tribunal in the normal manner
because she lacked the necessary two years' employment.
Instead she invoked a section of the Employment Protection Act,
claiming that health and safety issues were involved in the loss of her
#10,000 a year job.
She claimed she had been ordered by Mrs Stewart, of Culduthel Park,
Inverness, to connect up the computer where there were loose wires and
screws ''like Spaghetti Junction''.
But Mrs Stewart and Mr Justice claimed she had never raised health and
safety matters with them.
Mrs McKerron's husband, Colin, of South Street, Elgin -- health and
safety manager with United Distillers -- told the tribunal he noticed
Mrs Stewart was ''overtly aggressive'' in her manner with his wife at a
two-day seminar. And he had previously warned his wife not to tamper
with electrical equipment.

<HEADLINE>Ashdown blanks out Blair offer.  Lib-Dem anger at hint of links.</HEADLINE>

FURIOUS Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown yesterday told Labour to
come up with some clear policies if there is to be any prospect of
co-operation between the two parties.
He particularly challenged Labour leader Tony Blair to prove his offer
of closer links was genuine by backing Lib-Dem opposition to any tax
cuts in November's Budget.
Mr Ashdown and his senior colleagues were clearly angered by comments
from Mr Blair in which he said he was prepared to discuss key policies
with the Liberal Democrats before an election and to discuss legislation
with them afterwards.
However, Mr Ashdown accused Labour of having no clear policies. ''You
can't negotiate with a blank piece of paper,'' he said.
At a Westminster news conference, Mr Blair appeared to soften his
line, though the offer of some sort of co-operation still was there.
''We are a strong, independent party with our policies and programmes,
but if there are areas where, in the interests of the country, we can
agree and co-operate then we will do that.''
The Liberal Democrats at all levels feel Mr Blair has moved
deliberately to overshadow their conference, at which they are trying to
set out their own, distinctive agenda. On Sunday the conference passed a
strategy document which said: ''Our opposition to this Conservative
Government will not mean cosying up to Labour.''
Mr Ashdown said yesterday that three years ago he had led the calls
for an end to the squabbling among political parties and more
co-operation, but he made clear that at this stage he did not believe
the Labour Party had anything to offer. On the conference floor,
feelings against Mr Blair and Labour bordered on the vitriolic.
The view is that Mr Blair is trying to steal the Liberal Democrats'
clothes, if not their votes, and Mr Ashdown, who is bound to refer to
the matter in his keynote conference address today, has issued a clear
''come and get me'' message to Mr Blair.
He argued that his party this week was producing clear-cut policies on
a range of issues, but so far, ''Labour has simply failed to come up to
the mark''. He said it was going the wrong way on such key issues as
regional government and reform of the House of Lords, and added: ''You
can't negotiate with a blank piece of paper.''
Lib-Dem president, Caithness and Sutherland MP Robert Maclennan,
issued a strong rebuff to Labour's overtures. He told the conference
that Mr Blair's extension of the hand of friendship was a ''well-merited
tribute'' to the Liberal Democrats' achievements, but described Labour
as a party ''paralysed since the defeat of 1992'' and desperate not to
give offence.
He said: ''Has a kind message from a friend altered our resolve? I
think not.
''As we said yesterday, say again today and will go on saying to
whoever may pay us the compliment of giving us a call, the Liberal
Democrats are an independent, growing party with a distinctive political
and policy agenda for Britain. That is our unambiguous reply.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's spokesmen on Treasury affairs, said that
when the Tories set out their tax bribes stall this year, Labour would
be left speechless, ''all soundbite and no substance''.
He went on: ''For many years we said we wanted to get rid of the
Labour Party, now Tony Blair is doing it. He tries to steal all our best
ideas. But although Mr Blair may think he is creating the basis for a
Labour victory he is really composing a recipe for what would, in
Government, be a split and directionless party.''
Lord Holme, chairman of the party's General Election team, said:
''Although I would by no means rule out Labour and the Liberal Democrats
working together to implement an agreed programme to change Britain for
the better, I certainly do not want the parties to amalgamate because I
believe we have different analyses, different values and a different
perspective on Britain's future.

<HEADLINE>Manager denies Faldos are to split</HEADLINE>

GOLFER Nick Faldo's manager yesterday denied that the European Ryder
Cup team member was divorcing his second wife Gill.
Mr John Simpson said: ''Nick and Gill are not getting divorced. I find
the whole thing extraordinary. All Nick is concentrating on at the
moment is winning back the Ryder Cup.''
Mrs Faldo, 37, was angered by the newspaper speculation as she flew
from London's Heathrow airport with the European team to join her
husband, already in America.
Looking tearful and upset, she told reporters: ''I have absolutely no
comment to make.''
The golfer's manager hit out at the media for running stories saying
that the Faldo marriage of nine years was on the rocks. The Sun led the
field with an exclusive headlined ''Faldo's #10m divorce shocker''.
He said: ''There is not a direct quote from Nick or Gill in any of the
stories. I don't know where they came from. All I can say is that Nick
and Gill are not getting a divorce.''
European captain Bernard Gallagher said he did not think the publicity
about Nick's marriage would affect the team's chances of wresting the
Ryder Cup from the Americans this weekend. The three-day tournament is
being staged in Rochester, New York State.
He conceded the pressure of playing top level golf did put a strain on
marriages. ''History proves it does,'' he said. ''They do spend a lot of
time away.''
The Faldos married in 1986, after his first marriage, to former sports
journalist Melanie, ended in 1984, after five years.     Mrs Faldo has
helped build her husband's businesses, and is a director of Nick Faldo
International. It is estimated he earned #4m last year.

COMEDIAN Tony Roper and former Govan MP Mr Andy McMahon re-trod old
ground yesterday at a ceremony to begin the construction of a
controversial futuristic extension to the SECC at Queen's Dock, Glasgow.
The #30m building, made of eight aluminium clad bands and dubbed 'the
Armadillo' by critics of its appearance, features a 3000-seater
auditorium and will make the SECC among the largest conference complexes
in Europe.
Mr McMahon, 75, who spent 28 years as a shipwright at Queen's Dock and
for whom Mr Roper was an apprentice, called the building ''a new
milestone in the development of Glasgow''.
SECC chief executive Mr Mike Closier said the facilities, designed by
Sir Norman Foster and due for completion in 1997, would double the
centre's existing conference capacity, enabling it to generate 2800 jobs
and an annual #70m for the economy of Greater Glasgow.

<HEADLINE>Man who fooled Bearsden Academy. A '17-year-old' schoolboy was an old boy of 32.</HEADLINE>

A 32-YEAR-old man posed as a 17-year-old pupil at one of Scotland's
leading schools then went on to university to study medicine, continuing
to claim that he was a teenager, it emerged last night.
Brandon Lee, as he called himself, gained five A-grade Highers at
Bearsden Academy, near Glasgow, while claiming to be 17, then went on to
Dundee University in October last year with the aim of becoming a
doctor.
He had previously been a pupil at Bearsden Academy, but left between
14 and 17 years ago.
On his return to the school, he had presented documents which
convinced teaching staff he had been at another school but had moved
into the area.
It is understood he left university at the end of first term for
personal reasons but was due to resume his studies next month.
Places on medicine courses are in high demand and Dundee does not
normally offer them to anyone aged over 30.
A spokeswoman for the university said last night: ''We have a student
with that name. We are surprised about this and will be conducting our
own inquiry.''
Strathclyde region has also begun an investigation to establish how Mr
Lee managed to pass himself off as a 17-year-old fifth-year pupil at the
secondary. He left in June last year.
Education leaders are now bound to face a barrage of questions over
the incident. Concerned parents are likely to be worried that a
32-year-old man was in classrooms with youngsters under false pretences.
However, Lee was said to be a model pupil who fully participated in
extra curricular activities and was desperate to become a doctor. He
joined the school in 1993 as a fifth year pupil.
He had a Bearsden address which the school checked, and when it was
confirmed as accurate, he was enrolled.
The head teacher, Mr Norman MacLeod, last night declined to discuss
the matter because it was under investigation by Strathclyde's education
department.
His deception came to light this summer when he went to Tenerife on
holiday with two girls who were former classmates. They had stayed on at
the school for a sixth year.
It is understood Spanish police went to his accommodation after he was
arrested following a bar-room brawl.
The Herald has been told the girls handed police two different
passports with two different names, and two ages, 17 and 32.
It is understood Mr MacLeod was aware of rumours about what was said
to have happened over the summer and investigated them. In the course of
his investigations it is undestood that he has seen Lee to discuss the
matter.
The school is in Strathclyde region's Dunbarton Division, and the
authority's director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, said last night:
''We were taken aback by this. We have undertaken a detailed
investigation into the matter. It appears to be a case of
misrepresentation.''
Two former classmates of Brandon Lee said last night that he often
returned to Glasgow from Dundee University where he met old friends over
a drink at The Beefeater Steakhouse in Bearsden's Old Station.
''When he first came to school he looked older than the others, but
that sometimes happens. He said he was 15 then,'' said Gordon Barron,
18, of Rubislaw Drive.
''I thought he was a teacher, but when someone looks older you just
get used to it. He was popular and outgoing and told jokes like anyone
of our age.'' He also acted in the school play, taking the lead in South
Pacific.
Jonathan Shearer, 17, who along with Gordon, was in the same
registration class as Lee.
''He said he was from Canada, but was always a bit vague about where
exactly he came from. He said he lived with an aunt.
''He didn't invite people home, but he took part in things and was
very sociable.''
A teacher at the school said last night: ''We knew he had a peculiar
background. He had been to America. He looked so much older than the
other pupils.
''We thought he had such a mature vocabulary. He was in the school
show and wrote a couple of stories for the school magazine.'' One was
set in a pub and centred around the relationship of a mother and her
boyfriend.
There were reports last night that some of the teachers who originally
taught him helped him through his Highers. It was said they had failed
to recognise him.
Last night the motive for his masquerading as a school pupil was
uncertain.
Scottish secondaries take on adult returners to the classroom and if
Mr Lee had gone to the school as a mature student he would have been
enrolled.
* Brandon Lee was the name of the actor son of the late Bruce Lee, the
martial arts film star. He died during the filming of The Crow.
