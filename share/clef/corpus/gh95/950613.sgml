THE fourth Scottish Schools Essay Competition, organised by the
University of Paisley library and sponsored by John Smith and Sons
(Glasgow) Ltd, was held recently. Here is a shortened version of the
winning entry from Beverley Woolfson, a second-year pupil at Uddingston
Grammar School, which was described by the judges as ''remarkably
powerful and mature''.
Beverley Woolfson's prize-winning essay --
HELEN HUNTINGDON was a character from the book The Tenant of Wildfell
Hall by Anne Bronte, first published in 1848. It is the rather sad yet
gripping and dramatic story of a failed marriage ruined by the
dissipation of the husband. When published it caused quite a scandal, as
in those days it was thought to be a great sin if a wife contemplated
leaving her husband, even if he treated her in the shocking way that
Helen was treated . . .
Helen's miseries began when, against the warnings of her aunt and
uncle, she married Arthur Huntingdon, a very handsome, charming yet
riotous and unsettled man. At first their love was sweet and pure, their
first few months of marriage were extremely happy and seemed destined to
go on like this.
But then just as everybody had warned Helen, Arthur became rather
restless and started going away on long business trips, where he would
be away for weeks at a time.
At first he would write letters almost every day telling Helen how
much he missed her, and Helen would do the same in return. When he
returned home he was loving to Helen, but she could tell he was slipping
back into his old ways of gambling and drinking.
Slowly this thought proved to be true, and he began staying away for
longer and becoming more aggressive towards Helen. She became pregnant,
and when their son was about three years old, she fled from Arthur to a
small village where her brother lived, which was where Wildfell Hall was
situated.
It was there that she fell in love with Gilbert Markham, a young
bachelor who lived on a farm in the village, and married him soon after
Mr Huntingdon's death from alcoholism.
Helen was obviously a very strong person. This is just one of her
wonderful qualities that I admire so much. In nearly every page of her
diary and every scene with Arthur, this undaunted strength was shown.
For instance, one night when Arthur and Helen had company, but Helen
knew that Arthur was having an affair and therefore according to her
were only husband and wife in name, Arthur and his friends were
discussing Helen and Arthur declared: ''My wife? What wife? I have no
wife -- or if I have, look you, gentlemen, I value her so highly that
any one among you that can fancy her may have her and welcome -- you
may, by jove, and my blessing into the bargain!''
Helen, although she kept a cool front on it, must have been deeply
hurt by these spiteful and evil words.
This situation brings in another of her strengths -- her amazing
calmness in those terrible situations with Arthur. I find it a great
help to me in everyday life. Even though I am never in the appalling
positions that Helen was so often in, I now see that it really helps me
when I am about to lose my temper, just to remember how Helen would have
reacted and how she coped with her own problems with Arthur. It helps me
put my problems into perspective.
She was one of the nicest, sweetest and most honest persons one could
ever be lucky enough to meet. When she gave birth to their son, who was
also named Arthur, she always thought of him first.
For example, when she discovered that her husband was having an affair
with Annabella Lowburgh, she only stayed in the same house as him
because of her little son. She knew that if she fled from Arthur with no
money and no definite long-term shelter then her baby would suffer
terribly too, and she could not bear to see that.
(Helen knew that she had to escape Arthur, but a lot of planning would
have to go into it beforehand).
So Helen's kind nature was one of the things that struck me most about
her. It was a great shame that this nature had to be so deeply hidden
from the world and instead a rather heartless and icy front had to be
put on, all because of Arthur's atrocious behaviour.
Although I admire Helen very much, nobody is perfect, and there were a
few situations with Arthur where I thought she reacted wrongly. There is
a particular scene that comes to mind where one night Helen was out in
the garden and so were Arthur and Annabella Lowburgh.
Not knowing that Helen was there quietly standing in the shadows, they
began talking of the love they had for each other, and Arthur told her
that he had no love left for Helen and talked of her in a very poor way,
laughing at her and scorning her.
He also made it quite clear that he was very proud of the way he had
fooled her into thinking he still loved her. I know Helen was in shock
at hearing these words, for although she already had her doubts, it
really stung to hear these doubts confirmed by Arthur himself.
I WAS surprised, however, that Helen did not confront him there and
then and tell him what she thought of him but there could be a number of
reasons, such as that she was thoroughly shaken by his hurtful words and
felt unable to speak right then, and another was that then it was
thought to be a disgrace and dreadfully out of turn to speak to a man as
she might have done at that time, so she maybe just felt rather scared
of speaking to a male person like that.
There are so many reasons why I feel I have become friends with Helen,
and a great number of them are hard to describe for they are my own
personal, deep down reasons. The main ones are, of course, her
tremendous bravery and courage, her undaunted strengths and her
wonderful personality -- her sweetness, kindness and calmness.
I think that she was a truly fantastic person, and I will never forget
what a brilliant person she was. Although she was just created in Anne
Bronte's mind, she has become very real to me. I feel that if only I
could meet her now, we would become the best of friends.

How America welcomed a basketball skyscraper from Scotland
AT the age of 18, Stuart MacKay has already made quite a name for
himself in the world of basketball. Being 6ft 10in tall can't have done
any harm, though he knows boys more than a foot smaller than him who are
quality players because of their speed and ball-handling skills.
Stuart is nearing the end of his first year as a student at Memorial
Day High School in Savannah, Georgia. His American stay is the reward
for the remarkable success in basketball he achieved as a pupil at
Castlehead High School in Paisley.
He didn't even start playing until just over three years ago, when a
chemistry teacher at Castlehead, Ronnie Mather, persuaded him to have a
go. Until then, his sports had been golf and football.
In his first session, Castlehead -- a school with a high reputation in
basketball -- reached the Scottish final but lost. By fifth year, Stuart
was in the national team, and was playing for the Paisley Clanford club,
of which Mr Mather was coach. There was a price of sorts to pay for his
rapid progress -- he sustained a bad ankle injury in the Castlehead
team, and lost two front teeth at Paisley Clanford.
A basketball team has five players -- two guards (defenders), two
forwards (who play wide) and a post player (the main attacker). Because
of his height and size, Stuart was an obvious choice as post player, the
man to position ''down under the basket''.
There is, of course, more to his success than that. ''For my size, I'm
quite coordinated,'' he says. ''I was slow at the start, but Mr Mather
got me into intensive work-outs and taught me tactics. By fifth year,
and through playing for Scotland, I had matured and could apply the
tactics.''
At that time, having taken Standard Grades, Stuart was doing a range
of Scotvec modules as the first part of a two-year Higher course -- his
eventual Highers would have been in English, history and PE. Thereafter,
he wanted to study leisure management at FE college.
His path seemed settled. Then an international basketball scout sent a
letter to Paisley Clanford, wondering if they had any really promising
young players interested in a spell in America.
The result was that Stuart was offered a place at Memorial Day, a
private high school, with a scholarship and the chance to stay with an
American family during the two-year course. He made his own selection of
classes -- including English, chemistry, anatomy, French and history
(American, world and medieval) -- and over the two years he has to
achieve a total of 12 credits.
If he is awarded his Graduation Certificate, and passes a Scholastic
Aptitude Test not unlike a general IQ test, he may be offered a college
place and a new scholarship, probably studying history but still aiming
at an eventual career in leisure management.
Indeed, colleges in South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama have already
made contact with him by letter. A year before he is due to become
eligible, they will talk to him by telephone in the summer. Under the
rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, they are not
allowed to arrange a meeting with him at that stage. The system
commendably puts the interest of the young athletes first.
Basketball is really big business in the US. A thriving team can bring
both sponsorship and good publicity to a school. Stuart says that the
houses nearly all have goals erected outside them, and the sport is on
TV almost every day.
In this atmosphere his play is continuing to blossom. His Memorial Day
team reached the last four in the State Championship, and finished
second in their region (Georgia is split into four regions). He is a
member of the all-State team and the Savannah National Team which
undertakes competitive tours.
In Savannah he lives with the ''really great'' Sussman family -- dad
runs an audio store, mum is a secretary with an insurance company, Brian
is 17 and Jill 11.
Savannah is one of the oldest cities in the USA, with warm weather and
avenues lined with palm trees, and the countryside around it is lovely.
Its main industries are farming and cotton and tobacco growing. The
lifestyle is ''relaxed and laidback, and even professional people often
go into work in jeans and T-shirt.''
In his spare time, Stuart eats out and visits the movies and the mall
-- the words already come to him more naturally than ''cinema'' and
''shops''.
It hasn't all happened just because he's 6ft 10in. He's a naturally
sporty lad who has built on an asset given to him. The asset by itself
wasn't enough -- it needed the intensive work-outs, the sharpening of
skills, the commitment of his leisure time as well. Good luck to Stuart
-- we shall be hearing more of him.

* I WOULD like to draw attention to the travelling conditions of
cattle and sheep. These poor animals are overloaded into small cattle
floats and taken to foreign countries to be slaughtered and cut up into
meat for us to eat.
Not only are the older animals treated like this but so are the
calves, lambs and even horses.
Some calves are locked up in barns with very little light getting in.
They are fattened up and then they are taken to be slaughtered.
If the animals are almost dead when they get to the slaughter-house,
they are hoisted out with a large crane. The big spikes stab into the
animal's body and then it is dumped in a cart.
The drivers don't pay any attention to these animals and only think
about themselves.
If the animals have to die, why not let them die in their home country
and then be taken abroad?
-- Liz Gold, second year, Lanark Grammar School.
Meating our needs
* I AM writing to bring to your attention another side to the
vegetarian issue.
I myself am a meat eater. I am concerned about the way young people
are being brainwashed into vegetarianism.
In my opinion the human body was not designed to survive on vegetables
alone. Man was traditionally a hunter who had to go out and either find
or kill to feed himself.
Anyone contemplating a vegetarian lifestyle needs to think very
carefully about how they are going to replace protein and vitamins in
their diet. You cannot cut meat out of your life without replacing it
with another form of protein.
If we are not careful, the next couple of generations of human beings
could end up as malnourished, weak individuals.
-- Jason Bark, second year, Lanark Grammar School.
Blow-back
* I AM writing to you about smoking. I am not a smoker, but because of
other people smoking my clothes and hair smell of it.
Sometimes my mum thinks I have been smoking because of the smell.
The problem is mostly on the buses going home. There are quite a lot
of smokers on my bus and sometimes we aren't allowed to open the
windows. I think the only way to stop this is to have supervisors on the
bus.
Another problem is in the school toilets. The smokers sometimes blow
smoke in my face. The way to stop this is to attach a smoke detector on
the ceiling (with a cage round it).
-- Brian Hastings, second year, Lanark Grammar School.
Thin-skinned
* I WOULD like to know, along with many other people, why there is a
pressure on teenage girls to be thin.
Thousands of teenagers starve themselves each year and become bulimic,
anorexic or end up with some kind of eating disorder simply because they
themselves think they are overweight or because other people have told
them so.
Another negative influence is the many models and actresses who are
slim and beautiful. People say being thin doesn't change your life, but
personally I think it would because people accept you for what's on the
outside, not what's on the inside, even though that's what matters.
I think the world would be a better place if everyone accepted
everyone else for what they are and not what they want them to be.
-- Anne Hamilton, second year, Lanark Grammar School.
Dress sense
* I AM writing to tell you my opinion of school uniforms. I think that
they should be abolished because they are totally unfashionable.
I do realise that not all schools make them compulsory, but if there
is a uniform it most likely will encourage parents to make their
children wear them. It would be much more effective if children could
wear whatever they want and only dress with a shirt and tie on special
occasions.

Two girls of other cultures talk about their lives in Scotland. First,
Egyptian Fatima Beltagui on clothes . . .
MY clothes make a statement about both my religion and personality. As
a Muslim I have to cover my whole body except for my face and hands. My
clothes have to be opaque, thick, and must not reveal the lines of my
figure. This is called hijab in Arabic and it is worn to discourage
sexual interaction outside marriage.
Western society, influenced by the media, takes the view that wearing
hijab is degrading and submissive as women are forced to do so by their
fathers and husbands. This is not so. I wear a scarf because I want to,
not because someone forces me to. I am proud of my hijab.
As a responsible young adult, I have made this decision because I
believe that what I am doing is the right thing as regards my religion.
I do not see hijab as submissive and degrading because it is a religious
and moral issue and not a matter of culture and tradition. Far from
being a sign of submissiveness, I find that British society forces those
wearing hijab to have more self-confidence in themselves and their
religion, as they stick out so much in the crowd.
As an Egyptian living in a Western culture, my clothes tend to be very
much like everyone else's, but with long skirts and a scarf on my head.
These few differences can make me look very conspicuous.
Another misconception is that hijab leaves no room for individualism.
Many women all over the world wear hijab, but this does not restrict
their self-expression. Different cultures often have different styles of
clothing.
For example, an Arab woman would probably wear a long black enveloping
coat, while a Pakistani woman might wear shalwar-kaamiz -- a knee-length
shirt with baggy trousers underneath of beautiful and colourful
material. North African women are quite Westernised when it comes to
dress, and those who wear hijab wear longer versions of Western clothes
in the flamboyant colours typical of their area.
Even within a country the clothes worn are still not identical. Just
as two people wearing jeans and T-shirts can look entirely different, so
even two women wearing long coats and scarves are unlikely to look the
same. They may be wearing different-coloured coats and scarves, the
scarves might be patterned or plain, and there are many ways of wearing
a scarf. The way their scarves are secured is likely to be completely
different: tied with a knot, a safety pin or a mouthful of pins;
fastened at the side, under the chin or on the top of the head; the ends
trailing, tucked into the coat or around the neck.
However, my clothes tend to reflect more than my religion and origin.
They also say a lot about my character and surroundings.
As an Egyptian, I have a rather over-dramatic approach to life, and
the sections of my wardrobe bought in Egypt definitely emphasise this.
Take, for example, a rather bright pair of vibrant orange trousers with
a bold orange-and-green tartan shirt to match.
In Egypt, where everyone wears flamboyant colours and designs, this is
all very well, but it is not the kind of thing that I could wear here,
because I would feel very self-conscious about sticking out in the
crowd.
I came to Britain as a five-year-old, and being brought up in Scotland
has had an effect on my character, which is reflected in the more
neutral colours and the quieter designs I wear. To balance my
distinctive clothes, I often buy clothes in very subdued colours. I also
tend to wear jeans a fair portion of the time, a direct result of their
dominant presence in the society I live in.
Compared with many of my contemporaries, I have a slightly romantic
outlook and this is reflected in my love of long, flowing skirts, which
I much prefer to trousers. I also have a love of comfort, and around the
house I tend to wear a jalabiya or jilbab, a loose, simple dress of a
very traditional North African design which reflects the vivid colours
and designs of that part of the world -- a marked contrast to the grey
and murky weather of Scotland.
In conclusion, my clothing says a lot about me: my religion, my
background, my upbringing and my character: I am a 15-year-old Muslim
girl, a product of an Egyptian heritage and Scottish upbringing. My
wardrobe reflects this.

A boxing feature in a recent issue excited plenty of comment. Here are
a few samples from our postbag:
NOT SURE: I am not sure that boxing should be banned because I believe
that boxers will still box, and will do so illegally. This means that
there will be no doctors to help them if they get injured, it will take
longer to get them to hospital, and more may die before they get there.
-- Donna Brown, Primary 5, St Joseph's Primary, Blantyre.
* DANGEROUS: I think boxing is very violent and many injuries are
caused by this sport. Some boxers end up with brain damage, others can
be scarred for life.
If boxing was banned there would be many illegal fights. These matches
would not have the same rules and could get seriously out of hand.
Boxing is very dangerous, and I think anyone who wants to take part in
this sport must already have a bad case of brain damage.
-- Pamela Doonin, Primary 6, St Joseph's Primary, Blantyre.
* CAUSES DEATHS: I am writing to tell you what I think of boxing. I
think boxing should be banned because it causes so many deaths. Many
other sports, such as American Football and sports car racing, are also
dangerous, but boxing seems to cause more deaths and injuries.
I think this is because other dangerous sports have certain safety
rules, such as the wearing of protective clothing at all times. Some
boxers suffer brain damage because of boxing. If boxing is allowed there
should be more safety rules, especially about protecting the head.
-- Lara Macpherson, Primary 5, St Joseph's Primary, Blantyre.
* NO BAN: I think that boxing should not be banned. I think that the
boxers should wear protection for their head, and then there would be
less head injuries. If boxing was banned there would still be fights,
but they would not be legal fights, and then more people would be hurt
and there would be no doctors there to help them.
I also think that the price of a ticket is very high, and there should
only be about nine rounds instead of fifteen rounds as this is very
long, and that is why more people are hurt.
-- Anne Louise Savage, Primary 5, St Joseph's Primary, Blantyre.

And American Meghan van Horne has her say about the nonsense of image
and stereotyping.
WILDERNESS. Castles. Kilts. Bagpipes. Sheep. Rain. Shortbread. Whisky.
Eagles. Waves crashing on a rocky shore. Mystery. What does being
Scottish mean? Is it a false image that Scotland sells, stereotyping
itself just as other countries all over the world do?
Scotland is a land of tradition and beautiful landscaping. However,
the majority of the people are far from old-fashioned and could hardly
be known as rugged. Just as this country has its sparsely populated
towns, densely populated ones also exist.
The postcards pictorially describing this modern place frequently
forget what country they are representing. Or do they? Many people want
to see the traditional Scotland and cannot realise it is quite like any
other growing twentieth-century country.
The Scottish are frequently thought of as a whisky-drinking,
kilt-wearing people; yet, since I have arrived here, I have seen only
one person with a kilt and no more whisky than one would find in any
other country.
The people are not savages, they never have been, and chances are they
never will be. So why do shows like Rab C Nesbitt exist? This is a
stereotype presented by the Scottish and for the Scottish, yet many
Scottish do not approve.
On the other hand, maybe such stereotypes are okay. Perhaps, instead
of trying to conform to this sterotype, everybody will become his or her
own person. Individuals make up a country, not images. Eventually, a
time will come when Scotland will be portrayed as it is, but until then
it will surely be more kilts and more whisky . . .
People cannot control others' thoughts and feelings; they can only be
in charge of their own. This means there is a possibility that the
images of purity, innocence and wildlife will always remain.
Although foreigners think of bagpipes, kilts, whisky and shortbread
when an image of Scotland comes to mind, they do not expect everyone to
be identical and become a part of the stereotype. This is because it is
just a stereotype. Despite the fact that stereotypes are wrong, they
will not cease to exist.
People may view the United States as only movie stars, junk food and
free-living, but hopefully they know the truth in their heads. Where
there is a modern-day country, such as the United States or Scotland,
there are modern-day people.
Stereotypes show the ignorance that exists around the world. The
majority of people who view Scotland as old-fashioned have never
visited, much less lived here. Yet people voice their opinions and try
to give first-hand accounts of Scotland all the same, and that is wrong.
Possibly, if more people were to come to Scotland they would realise
their ignorance. Until then, however, the lack of knowledge about the
truth will remain.
Coming to Scotland from the United States, I knew it rained and I was
familiar with some of the traditions. However, I certainly did not
expect to see these traditions exhibited everyday. This is another
example which helps to prove that stereotypes are just images.
Stereotypes are television programmes and postcards, but they are
anything except realistic Scotland.

HERE it is -- the last issue of Schools Herald before the summer
holidays.
There's a theme of ambition running through it, with a lad who is
already big -- 6ft 10in, to be exact -- in the world of basketball
(opposite page) and another who's going to train to become a falconer
(page 7).
Ambition leads to success, and we feature three young folk whose
skills as wordsmiths have won them first place in major writing
competitions. Read their pieces (on pages 4, 5 and 10) and find out what
makes a good story. Success in football is featured on the back page,
with the two school teams which fought their way through to the final of
The Herald Seven-a-Sides and now share the trophy.
If you have ambition, are looking for success and fancy your chances
at writing, why not think about your school taking over a two-page
spread of Schools Herald? Liberton High School in Edinburgh has done
just that this time round. If you feel your school could do the same,
why not talk to your teachers about it and get in touch? After all, it's
your paper.
Sun, sand and the box are fun, as are the summer movies and festivals
recommended by Brian McIver (page 11). But don't forget about reading.
We've enlisted the help of two school librarians to prepare suggested
summer reading lists for you, whatever your age. Pick a few to suit your
own taste (pages 12 and 13) and discover that reading is fun too. Honest
. . .
Have a good holiday!

How the final penalty shoot-out reached a happy ending for two top
teams.
THE FINAL of The Herald Seven-a-Sides took place on the perfect stage
-- Hampden Park, before the Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and
Airdrie. For the boys of Peebles High and John Ogilvie High in Hamilton,
it was one of the most exciting days of their lives. In the end the
teams could not be separated, and will hold the trophy for six months
each.
John Ogilvie, compact and well organised, scored early through Paul
Kaczan. Thereafter they seemed content to hold on, though looking
dangerous on the break. Peebles moved the ball around sweetly and
dominated the play, though it was the last minute before Steven McLean,
the scorer of all four goals in their semi-final, equalised.
It would have been unjust if Peebles had lost, because they had
maintained, even when losing, a calmness and precision which were what
The Herald Seven-a-Sides are all about.
The penalty shoot-out was tense. The teams took seven shots each,
missing two -- though the goalkeepers scored with theirs -- before it
was decided to call a halt by Mr Iain Forbes, managing director of
Caledonian Newspapers, and officials of the Scottish Schools Football
Association.
It was a merciful decision, sparing some poor lad the agony of knowing
that his miss had cost his team the trophy.
The relief on Steven McLean's face told a story. ''I felt excellent
about that goal,'' he said. ''It was great to know that it saved us from
defeat.''
The cup was presented by Mr Forbes and Mr Richard Thomson, president
of the SSFA. Mr Forbes -- whose company publishes The Herald -- said:
''We are delighted to sponsor this, the first tournament of its kind.
Today we have seen excellent touch football, which is what it is all
about.''
''The tournament has been an unqualified success,'' said Mr Thomson.
''The level of participation and quality of the football have been
outstanding.''
Let's keep the impetus going. Next season it could be you. Why not? A
few months ago these fine lads from John Ogilvie and Peebles could have
hardly expected to be joint holders of a prestigious national trophy.
* TEAM LINE-UPS
* John Ogilvie High: Thomas McGladrigan, Steven Hislop, Kristopher
Smith, Paul Kazcan, Paul Whitley, Alan Dempsie, Stephen Rouse, Jamie
McCarroll.
* Peebles High: Steven Haig, Michael Jack, Ian Dick, Gregor Forsyth,
Steven McLean, Craig Robertson, Colin Smith, Will Clark, Chris Evans.

AFTER too long an absence, the greatest animated cartoon ever
conceived has returned to terrestrial television -- The Ren and Stimpy
Show is back.
'Way back in 1992, the American children's channel Nickelodeon
commissioned a gaggle of cartoonists and animators to come up with
''Nicktoons'' -- five original animated series to be shown exclusively
on the Viacom-owned network. Most of these shows have been aired on this
side of the Atlantic (Rugrats and Rocko's Modern Life, for example) and
each is something of a departure from convention, but none has achieved
the cult status of Ren and Stimpy.
Credit for the show goes to the company known as Spumco, a melting pot
of extremely talented minds, but spearheaded by the enigmatic John
Kricfalusi (often shortened to John K). Director of most of the funniest
episodes, responsible for the overall look of the show, and the voice of
Ren, it's very much Kricfalusi's baby, with co-creators Bob Camp and Jim
Smith standing as godfather(s).
Attempting to explain the appeal of Ren and Stimpy is akin to trying
to dissect the humour of Reeves and Mortimer. The separate components
seem quite inert, but together, in the right hands, something magical
happens. The animators have provided us with characters that look funny
and move funnily. The writers have come up with a script that is by
turns surreal, lavatorial, satirical and slapstick. And lastly, the
backroom boys have unearthed musical gems and created sound effects that
ensure the show is hilarious even with your eyes shut.
For example, the inappropriate grinding and screaming of heavy
machinery as Stimpy performs his night-time abultions in Ren's Toothache
is priceless.
Although they have been portrayed as everything from space explorers
to ''Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen'', Ren and Stimpy are most often
found together as an animalistic odd-couple in a state of domestic
blight or as vagrants prepared to pull of any scam in the pursuit of
room and board. The key is that no matter where fate places them, their
love/hate relationship is maintained.
Ren Hoek, who at first glance appears to be some sort of rodent, is in
fact a certified ''asthma-hound chihuahua''. Ren is the choleric one,
the egotist with a short fuse and even shorter stature. Although the
quicker witted of the two, Ren seems to lack stability, and when life
gets tough his usual reaction is violent insanity and fitful weeping.
Ever by his side, Stimpson J Cat is a ''fat bloated eediot'' with a
fixation on his letter box. Despite his childlike personality, Stimpy
seems to have a better grasp on the fundamentals of life than his pal,
and remains unphased by such curiosities as the Bloody Head Fairy or
Magic Nose Goblins. Personifying the conflict inherent in many close
friendships, Ren would just as soon slap Stimpy around as give him a
hug.
But psychological profiles do little to reveal that ''magic''. Perhaps
The Ren and Stimpy Show's strength lies not with the main protagonists
but in its fringe elements. With recurring supporting characters like
Muddy Mudskipper, Mr Horse or Powdered Toast Man. Or maybe it's to do
with the constant intrusion of spoof adverts for ''Gritty Kitty
litter'', ''Sugar-Frosted Lumps'' breakfast cereal or the ever-growing
range of ''LOG'' toys (''It's all new Action LOG, with realistic facial
moss!'').
I suggest you find out for yourself. But be warned. BBC2 is currently
screening the second series of The Ren and Stimpy Show which was
produced with considerably less input from John Kricfalusi than the
first. Time will tell if that elusive Spumco quality can be maintained
without him. We'll certainly have fun finding out.
''Yes sir, I do like it.''

AMBITION
Townie Tony has a big future in falconry, writes Liz Taylor.
* SINCE he was 10 years old Tony Matteo has known exactly what he
wanted to do with his life -- and now that he's 16 he's doing it. The
son of well-known Glasgow restaurant owners, Tony is leaving his city
home and going to the Borders to train as a falconer and gamekeeper.
His parents, Linda and Tony senior, proprietors of the Candleriggs
Oyster Bar, are slightly bewildered by their son's unusual choice of
career, but feel they inadvertently gave him his first interest in
falcons because, on their way north on holiday six years ago, they
happened to spot a sign advertising Blair Drummond Park Game Fair and
stopped off to see what it was like.
Tony, whose only real contact with animals before that was with their
pet dog, was entranced by a display put on by a school of falconry and
said there and then that he wanted to be a falconer when he grew up.
''I'd never heard of falcons before that day but it was the way the
birds moved, their power and their strength that fascinated me,'' he
explains. ''People think I must have been influenced by stories about
knights of old riding out with falcons on their wrists but it was
nothing like that -- it was just the birds themselves.''
When they left Blair Drummond he took a pamphlet advertising the
Scottish Academy of Falconry -- at Bonchester Bridge, outside Hawick --
and, said his father, ''we began to have that piece of paper shoved
under our noses at every possible opportunity''.
Tony's persistence won the day and on the following Easter, when he
was not yet 11, his parents took him to Bonchester Bridge to visit the
Academy of Falconry -- where he enrolled in the introductory course.
Although it is usually recommended that children don't begin handling
birds until they are 12, the head of the school, Mrs Diana
Durman-Walters, agreed to accept Tony at 10.
''I could see that he was very focused, very determined, and very
calm,'' she recalls. ''Some children become excited and shout, which
frightens the birds, but Tony was very together so I decided to give him
a try.''
Since then, Tony has taken two courses a year, going to Bonchester
Bridge to stay with Mr and Mrs Durman-Walters and learning more and more
on every visit.
''When it all started I really thought he'd run out of enthusiasm
soon,'' says Tony's mother, Linda. ''But that's never happened. He's
just got more and more keen. It's been a learning experience for us too
because we now know lots about falcons, something we had no interest in
before.
''The walls of his bedroom at home are covered with pictures and
photographs of birds and at one stage we had to build an aviary in the
garden because he brought home a six-week-old owl chick.''
Owl chicks are difficult to rear but Tony's, which was called Barney,
survived till it was two years old when a local cat got it, much to his
disappointment.
Tony leaves Kelvinside Academy this month and in July goes, with the
school's full approval and enthusiasm, to become a student on a two-year
gamekeeping course in the Scottish Borders College at Newtown St
Boswells.
The course is run in three-week blocks with six weeks between them and
in the intervening time Tony will stay with the Durman-Walters at
Bonchester Bridge, helping with their birds -- and with the other
students on the courses.
He is now perfectly at ease with falcons and handles them with
confidence in spite of one testy bird sinking her hooked beak into his
arm a year ago.
''I thought, that'll put him off now, but it didn't,'' says his
mother.
She and Tony's father, both city bred, have become used to their son's
fascination for country life and display photographs of Tony with his
pet owl on the wall of their oyster bar. They have indulgently paid for
his courses and for the equipment necessary for handling falcons -- the
thick gauntlets cost #40.
Tony can hardly wait for his course to begin and is already looking
forward to his next ambition. ''I want to buy a European eagle owl soon.
They're much bigger than barn owls and you can train them to hunt for
things like rabbits,'' he says. His father didn't turn a hair when he
mentioned that a European eagle owl costs around #200.
Tony has already considered the career prospects of a gamekeeper who
is also a skilled falconer. There are apparently good opportunities for
work in Europe and Saudi Arabia but single-minded Tony has already
determined to go to Canada.
''I saw the film Due South a couple of weeks ago and thought -- that's
where I'll go when I start to work. It was the huge empty spaces, the
vastness and the silence of the place that appealed to me . . .''
It's a far cry from Candleriggs but Tony, who has already shown
determination beyond his years, will get to Canada in the end, that's
for sure.
* The Scottish Academy of Falconry is at The Wigg, Bonchester Bridge,
near Hawick. The owners run a series of courses from introductory to
advanced, and can be contacted on 01450 860666.

THE HOMELESS EXILES
MOST Scottish young people who go to London to see the bright lights
of the big city have their wish granted. Because cardboard boxes don't
have any roofs.
Borderline, a Scottish homeless organisation based in London, is doing
all it can to prevent young Scots ending up on the streets and to take
those who are on the streets off them. Last year alone they saw 557
clients, 43% of whom were aged between 16 and 25.
The initiative was set up in 1991 by the Church of Scotland London
Advisory Service (COSLAS) to combat the growing problem of homeless
Scots in London. Project administrator Donna Flemming explains: ''In the
80s COSLAS realised that there were more and more young Scots coming
down unprepared to London and ending up on the streets so they formed
Borderline.''
Borderline has identified the major reasons why young Scots come to
London. ''The main reason that we see is the 'streets are paved with
gold' scenario,'' says Donna. ''They think they'll come down here and
get a big job with big money and that's unrealistic.
''They come down here to find work and often find that they have left
school without adequate qualifications, for whatever reason, possibly
because of family problems.
''Then it goes down to categories,'' she says. ''Abuse in the family,
people fleeing violence, and then there's those who know the services
for homeless people are better than those in Scotland, which is a bit of
a scary notion because people are thinking, 'Well I'm homeless in
Scotland so I might as well go to London'.''
To combat this problem Borderline runs the Returning Home Initiative
(RHI) in conjunction with Shelter which aims to bring Scots who are
homeless in London back to Scotland. ''We are not a repatriation
organisation. We advertise a range of services and people come to us and
say they want to go back home,'' says Donna.
''If they are between 16 and 25 and they don't have any family or
friends to stay with we'll try and get them home through the RHI. It can
be done in a day in somewhere like Glasgow, and in a few days in, say,
Aberdeen.''
For those who do have someone to stay with the process can be even
more simple. ''Through the travel warrant scheme, if someone comes and
says to me, 'I've had enough, I want to go back home and I can stay with
whoever', we can have them home that night.
''But we make sure that they've got somewhere to go to once they get
off the bus. We don't take them from the streets of London and shove
them on the streets of Edinburgh.''
If you are determined to move to London, Donna has some advice.
''People who want to move to London should contact us first. They should
bring some identification and money down with them. If you've got family
or friends in London, speak to them first and try and stay with them for
a few days. If not, phone us before you come down and we can see about
the possibility, if any, of getting you accommodation.''
Borderline is at 127 Wilton Road (just round the corner from Victoria)
and can be contacted on 0171 828 8502.
TONY'S STORY
Ah've jist been drinkin' and sleepin' rough.
-- THE VOICE OF A YOUNG DREAMER WHO NOW CALLS BEGGING HIS 'WORK'
AH jist goat up one mornin' an' left. Ah wiz 18 at the time. Ah didnae
plan it or anythin'. Ah came doon tae London aboot a year ago cause ah
hud drug problems an' cause it's easier tae find work in London an' you
get better money here. Ah don't huv any contact wae ma family any more
except ma sister, ah still hear fae her.
When ah first got doon ah arrived at Victoria an' then a walked fae
Victoria intae the West End and a met a couple o' pals fae ma home toon.
Ah didnae know they wur doon here, ah just seen them by chance. Ah wiz
walkin' by Westminster an' ah heard somebdae shoutin' ''Tony!'' an' ah
turned roon' an' it wiz them shoutin' oan me. Ah've spent most o' ma
time wae them since.
Since ah've been doon here ah've jist been drinkin' an' sleepin' rough
aw the time. Ah slept rough in the West End, Ah hud a place where ah
slept every night, it wiz jist a doorway. I wouldnae ask anybdae else
tae sleep rough, bit you get used tae it after a while, it disnae seem
so bad.
When I came doon tae London at first ah didnae get any benefit or
anythin' so ah hud tae survive, well, way beggin'. If ah did an early
mornin' beg, fae say half-past seven tae half-past eight, ah'd make
aboot a tenner, an' if ah worked right through ah'd make roon about a
hundred quid a day. Ah'd jist drink this an' buy food and that an' some
o' it wid go on drugs as well, like Temazepam and heroin tae -- but ah
didnae inject it, ah jist smoked it.
Now ah've been sleepin' in a hostel fir about the last three weeks,
bit that's aboot it. The rest o' the time, fir the last year , ah've
been sleepin' rough in doorways an' stuff. Ah got ma place in the hostel
through Borderline. First ah went tae a place called London Connection
an' they said ma best bet would be to go tae Borderline cause they'd be
able tae help me better because they're a Scottish organisation.
Borderline huv helped me a lot an' they've sorted oot ma benefit for
me cause ah forgot tae take identification doon tae London wae me an'
you need that tae get benefit, so Borderline got ma birth certificate
for me.
Ah don't plan tae go back tae Scotland, ah'm happy in London. In
London there's mair people tae help you, an' ah think ah've got a better
chance o' gettin' a job than ah huv in Scotland, ah mean it's very poor
there.
Ah left school when ah wiz young so ah've no really got a lot o'
qualifications or anythin', but ah think ah'll be able to find work in
London anyway. Ah've no really been lookin' fir work jist now, but ah go
in tae day centres a lot an' gie them a hon wi different things.
Ah've been trying tae sort oot ma drug problem. Am oaf a lot o' them
an' ah jist take the odd bag of heroin the odd time. Ah'm tryin tae come
aff it, an' ah'm gonnae try an find work.

ONE of the great British summer traditions -- alongside knotted
hankies, paddling in pollution Doon the Watter, and watching last year's
repeats on telly -- is the Music Festival.
Ever since the classic rock 'n' roll extravaganzas of the sixties and
the seventies, the annual pilgrimages to the festival have become quite
an institution among the young.
This year, hundreds of thousands of youths and ageing hippies
(crusties) will travel the roads and the miles to one or more of the
high-profile happenings, such as Glastonbury, Reading, The Phoenix, and
Scotland's very own offering, T in the Park.
The first T in the Park, held last July in Strathclyde Park, attracted
around 50,000 revellers over the weekend, and some of the biggest names
in music, such as Bjork, Manic Street Preachers, Blur, Oasis, Cypress
Hill and Primal Scream.
This year the show is even bigger, with two extra stages for dance and
world music, and the line-up has such diverse acts as Beautiful South,
M-People, The Boo Radleys, The Prodigy, Paul Weller, Therapy?, Radiohead
and Elastica.
Like last year, many more big names are likely to be announced closer
to the event on August 5 and 6. Tickets for one day cost #25, and for
two days #42 until the end of June, then #45 from July.
While T may only be in its second year, the Glastonbury festival, held
near Glastonbury in the south of England, is the grandaddy of them all.
This year it will celebrate its 25th birthday in style with one of the
best line-ups yet.
Headlining the main stage over the three days -- June 23, 24, 25 --
will be Oasis, The Black Crowes, Soul Asylum, Simple Minds, P J Harvey,
Jeff Buckley, and The Stone Roses, making their first British live
appearance since their show at Glasgow Green in 1990.
Other bands include Belly, Tricky, Massive Attack, Freakpower, The
Prodigy, Supergrass, Offspring, Live, and many more.
However, the main thing about Glasto is that it is not all about the
music, it is more of a spiritual thing with all sorts of crafts going on
and the general atmosphere is just to mellow out and get into the vibe,
man, as it is all in aid of Greenpeace.
Tickets cost #65 for the three days, including camping and parking.
The other major festival in England is Reading, which has played host
to all of the major rock acts recently -- including exclusive
performances by Nirvana, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and Hole. That trend
looks set to continue this year with rumours abounding that Neil Young
is to perform, and will be joined by elusive grunge rockers Pearl Jim,
with whom he has just recorded an album. The other major coup of this
year's Reading will be a performance by Foo Fighters, the band led by
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl.
Other acts include Oasis, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Bjork, Green
Day, Hole and Throwing Muses.
Phoenix, on July 14-16 in Stratford-upon-Avon, will this year host
perhaps the most eclectic range of performers, including Bob Dylan,
Public Enemy, Suede, The Orb, Warren G, Faith No More, Underworld,
George Clinton, and The Charlatans. Tickets cost #58.
The English festivals may be institutions and well-established sources
of musical excitement, but do yourself a favour: save yourself a lot of
money by not travelling south and go for some T in the Park. The bands
on are as good as anywhere else in the country (and in some cases
better) and if last year's weekend-long groove-a-thon was anything to go
by, you will be in for a treat.

WITH almost two months of freedom on your hands come the end of the
month, what can you do? With the uncertainty of Scottish weather, one of
the safer options is a trip to the movies.
In the summer, Hollywood's brightest stars come out to shine and the
best of the best is on offer. As usual, the multiplexes will be
dominated by big-name action movies, but there is also a good helping of
comedies and the traditional family offerings.
Perhaps the highest profile movie of this year will be Batman Forever.
On this particular visit to crime-ravaged Gotham City, Val Kilmer
steps into the Dark Knight's boots as Batman/Bruce Wayne, after Michael
Keaton, the star of the first two movies, refused to reprise his role.
Also taking a back seat is Batman and Batman Returns director and
creator Tim Burton, who is replaced by Joel (Falling Down, The Client)
Schumacher.
As in Batman Returns, this Batman will have to face two superstar
villains, this time in the shape of Jim Carrey as The Riddler and Tommy
Lee Jones as Two-Face. To balance the odds, Chris O'Donnell will appear
as Robin -- without the green-and-yellow tights.
The other main summer sequel will be Die Hard 3: Die Hard With A
Vengeance, in which Bruce Willis is back as supercop John McLane
fighting terrorist Jeremy Irons (who is the brother of the German loony
that Willis defeated in the original Die Hard) across New York City.
Samuel L Jackson (of Pulp Fiction fame) is Willis's sidekick.
However, the two most eagerly-awaited movies of the summer are both
non-sequels; Judge Dredd and Waterworld.
Waterworld is Kevin Costner's #180 million spectacular, which needs to
be one absolute Jurassic-style hit or it will be the biggest flop of all
time. It is set way into the future when a planetary disaster covers the
entire Earth in water and leads, as you might suspect, to anarchy and
chaos; all fine ingredients for a great futuristic action movie.
Judge Dredd stars Sylvester Stallone as Dredd, the famous futuristic
crime fighter who rides about on his motorbike kicking crime-committing
ass all over the screen. Dredd is directed by the British helmer of
Young Americans, Danny Cannon, and is of course based on the 2000AD
comic character.
The biggest children's phenomenon of the last year has been the
Japanese hit Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which makes it to the big
screen this summer. This will undoubtedly be the same sort of smash as
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was some years back, and has the same sort
of plot level, ie non-existent. Nonetheless, the millions of fans will
lap it up, and it features pop bad girls Shampoo as themselves. The
summer Disney release is The Fox and the Hound, and junior whale lovers
can enjoy Free Willy 2.
For those of you who like a bit of sophistication, there is plenty on
offer.
Jefferson in Paris is another classic period drama from Merchant
Ivory, starring Julia Ormond; Arthurian tale First Knight stars Richard
Gere as Sir Lancelot opposit Julia Ormond (again) as Guinivere; Hugh
Grant has sympathetic labour pains in Nine Months, a romantic comedy
about pregnancy; Beyond Rangoon is the story of how one young American
started a revolt in Rangoon, starring Patricia Arquette, and directed by
John Boorman; and Dolores Claiborne is a dramatisation of a Stephen King
book, featuring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kathy Bates as a mother and
daughter with a deadly secret.
The no-brain contingent will be happy with Bad Boys, featuring
comedian Martin Lawrence and Fresh Prince Will Smith as tough,
unconventional cops fighting some assorted bad guys, and Tank Girl,
starring Lori Petty as the beer-swilling comic character who teams up
with mutant Kangaroo Ice-T to fight evil water companies.
This is just a smattering of the hundreds of movies which will be
released during the summer, so when the rain starts to fall, and that
game of tennis or fitba' in the park is called off, there should be
plenty to choose from.

A literary lunch with Liz Lochhead and a visit by Sheila Douglas of
the Scots Language Society are among the highlights of Book Week at
Liberton High School in Edinburgh this month. In the run-up to the
annual event, poet Janet Paisley visited the school to lead creative
writing workshops with students from S1-S3. Some of their work is
included here.
EVERYTHING CHANGES
I know that in the words of their song Everything Changes, but I and
millions of fans worldwide were totally unprepared for what the Fab Five
from Manchester had in store. On the first day of That Live 94 tour,
Take That revealed to us their new image. Some fans laughed, some fans
stood speechless and some, like me, cried. What had my gorgeous heroes
done?
I cried to myself all night, making my family lose their patience and
my friends moan. From the sweet, caring, down-to-earth boys next door,
overnight Take That had been transformed into Cheeky Devils, Raunchy
Rastas and Sex-Crazed Animals.
So who are Take That anyway?
Well, they're five guys from the Manchester area aged between 20 and
26. The band first formed in the late months of 1990 and the early
months of 1991. It was a man called Nigel Martin Smith, now known as
their manager, who spotted Howard and Jason in dance clubs, Gary at a
recording studio, Mark in the studio making tea, and Robbie, then 16, at
the audition they held to find a fifth member of the band.
It was a slow, hard start for the band but by the summer of last year
they were doing a 36-day tour with 10,000 screaming, obsessed fans each
night, adding up to 360,000 fans in all! So you can't exactly say that
they haven't been successful, can you?
For the first four years the band had a clean-cut image, the sort your
mother would approve of. Their clothes were smart and fashionable, in
soft colours which reflected their personalities. Their haircuts, again,
were typical up-to-date styles which once more reflected their
personalities. Whenever Take That appeared on the television for
interviews they put over the impression that they were wholesome, caring
guys.
Then suddenly, overnight, Take That changed.
Their clothes were now dark, raunchy, military style rags; they were
''the devils from hell'', the newspapers said. And my God, what had they
done to their hair? Howard was now in dreadlocks complete with a beard;
Mark, Jason and Gary were just completely transformed; and Robbie - my
gorgeous Robbie - had no hair at all!
As they marched on stage that night they looked like soldiers from
hell, dressed in their gleaming silver helmets, goggles and high
jackboots.
So why are so many people worried about the change of image? Why did
they do this? According to Mark Wareham of The Independent, it was
simply for the money.
''It is a little-known fact that their company derives its name from
the phenomenal sales of merchandise. 'I'll take that,' shout the girls
in the scrum at the sales counter, 'and that and that and that'.''
The That Live 94 tour made over #5m, and each member received a good
percentage of that. So maybe the change of image was just for the money.
But did their image really change?
Earlier tours which Take That did in the summer of '92 and '93 and at
Christmas '93 included sexually explicit dancing, gestures and movements
to boys-next-door songs like Give Good Feeling. So even in the good old
days the boys' TV and fan magazine image did not match up to the reality
of their live shows.
However, the 1994 tour fired off more complaints, especially from
concerned parents. ''I don't think my daughter should be seeing naked
men. I thought they were good clean-cut boys.''
Well, welcome to the real world parents! Why do you think your
daughters are so hung up on these guys? One number, their final song of
the night of the '94 tour, was where all the publicity blew up from, and
it was nothing we hadn't seen before. It was just a bare backside.
Fourteen-year-olds today are not so innocent as everyone seems to
think. We Take That fans are growing up, and so is the group. ''You
can't expect them to play about on stage like kids all the time,'' a fan
commented outside the arena in Glasgow after the first night of Take
That's 1994 tour.
And would Kelloggs, the manufacturers of the ''snap, crackle and pop''
cereals so well loved by children today, have supported Take That's 1994
tour if it had been too explicit?
I don't remember the media going so mad about Madonna's live sex on
stage during her 1992 world tour, but is that because she has grown up
with her fans, who over the years have grown up sophisticated and
mature?
If performers want to stay around and maintain their popularity, they
have to grow up. Look at Kylie, the popular teenybopper singer for 10 to
12-year-olds about six years ago.
Do they want to be listening to I Should Be So Lucky and songs like
that? No, they don't. So Kylie has made a comeback this year with an
image for the more mature listener and music to match the chic, sensual
sophisticated image.
And David Bowie changed his image not with every tour, but with almost
every song released. Pop history is littered with artists who have
developed and changed both their music and image and have been praised
for it. And it is not only musicians - what about painters and writers?
Artists are not like Peter Pan. Change and development are important
parts of any artist's career. And they are not the only ones who grow
up. We fans also change and grow up, and it's about time our parents did
too. We're not living in Never Never Land you know!

THE COUCH POTATO STRIKES BACK!
SINCE I began my school career at nursery, I have always watched
television. In fact some of my earliest memories of TV are of running
home from school at lunchtime to catch the opening sequences of Sesame
Street.
I used to love counting with Count Dracula and trying to beat him to
the special number, or spelling with Big Bird and trying to guess
''today's missing letter''. Other programmes such as Allsorts, Let's
Pretend and Rainbow also influenced me to read, write and count, not by
using books but by using television. I didn't realise it at the time but
while I was enjoying myself, I was learning.
During my primary school years, I began watching action and adventure
programmes, such as He-Man, The A Team, Knightrider and Streethawk.
These programmes influenced me to read spin-off comics and annuals.
Probably the most influential films of my life had to be the Star Wars
Trilogy. I loved the Star Wars films and soon became addicted to the
science fiction saga. I would read anything to do with the movies -
comics, annuals, newspaper articles, the film inlay cards. I would even
read the cast at the end of the film just to know a little more about
the films.
I collected the action figures and still have them to this day. During
the holidays I would watch the films once, maybe twice a day, and was
soon able to say most of the actors' lines off by heart.
I can remember always wanting a light sabre but never quite getting
hold of one, so I improvised by using my imagination. I had a
black-handled torch and I would keep it in my room and when nighttime
came I would turn my light off and the torch on. I would jump around my
room and the torch would act and feel like my very own light sabre. So
Star Wars not only made me read more, but made me use my imagination as
well.
Star Wars was a huge influence in my childhood, and I was an addict to
the saga and still am. Star Wars also influenced me to watch other
science fiction programmes such as Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers
in the 21st Century.
When I was a little older, I became more interested in football, and
it was then I began collecting stickers for the yearly annuals. I
watched Saturday football programmes such as Saint and Greavsie and
Match of the Day. These programmes influenced me to read the sports
section of the newspapers to look out for my favourite team.
Recently a film called Jurassic Park was released in the cinema. The
film is basically about genetic engineers creating a dinosaur theme
park. The dinosaurs break loose and cause havoc among the islands. When
I went to see the film, it was the Star Wars syndrome all over again. I
did not go as far as to collect the figures or read the cast at the end
this time, but I did read the book and many newspaper articles.
Nowadays I watch soaps on TV. I do not really learn anything from them
and the furthest I go to reading about them is in the TV guide. I do
like watching programmes such as the X-Files and Fantasy Football but I
do not learn anything from them.
Nowadays I do not think of television as an animated textbook, but
more of a noise in the background. There are no programmes that I would
run home from school to watch or tape if I am out.
When I was younger, television did influence me to read and write and
use my imagination, so I do think television helped me learn... but no
more.
I REMEMBER... GRANNY
MY Grandmother, a tall woman, well built,
although not fat, smartly dressed with a warm,
loving glow on her face, her hair perfect, a mass of
curls all shiny like silver when the light hit them.
This was the picture I saw when I looked at my
Granny, the woman my father called ''Mum''.
She was a loving woman, just what a Granny
should be - someone to take you to the swings,
someone to give you too many sweets, someone to
let you watch TV till nine o'clock when you
should have been in bed long ago.
I was only eight and she in her late sixties. We all
loved her (and still do). We loved her smile, we
loved her strong will, we especially loved her
hazelnut cake, the cake that was all floaty
meringue and bulging at the sides with butter icing
and the nutty smell wafting out of the oven as it
cooked. This was a special cake baked for
special occasions.
We always went to her house on a Sunday for tea.
Every week a different delight. Lamb roast one
week, then roast beef, the next again it could be
chicken, but it was never the same thing two weeks
in a row.
Before dinner my sister and I would hide away in
the spare room, which we would transform into
our own corner shop or even a spaceship where
we would go on magical journeys to far away
places with only a few toys to help us win the
battles that might occur along the way.
Meanwhile, my Mum and Dad would be doubled
over pulling out weeds in the garden, or Mum
would be slogging it out in the kitchen helping to
prepare the feast that awaited the weary
travellers, while Dad would sit back and relax
over a game of football on the television.
Or Kirsty and I would empty the cupboard in the
kitchen, overflowing with multi-coloured tins of
fruit, jellies and dusty custard powder and set up
our shop in our magical room. Had we done
this at home we would have copped it but as a
Granny does, our Gran let us carry on.
I always got on well with my Grandmother. We
would go to the shops together; I think I even
went to Church with her once. Then she became
ill. We did not notice at first but she was
suffering from Alzheimer's. This is a very
destructive illness. It does not just destroy the
person suffering from it, but also those watching it
happen.
I do not remember much about the start of it all but
I do remember when we would go on a Sunday and
Granny would have on two jumpers or three
skirts. I was only eight.
Next my Mum and Dad had to organise a home
help to make sure Gran was eating properly as
she had lost a lot of weight. Then she stopped
doing things like she had done. Instead of a
different meal each Sunday, it was mince and
potatoes each week or pancakes - and no hazelnut
cake!
Even I had noticed the change in her by the time she
came to live with us - about two years later - but I
found it very hard to understand. What had
happened to the woman with the sweets? Where
had she gone? Now there was only the empty shell
of that woman. I wanted my Granny back.
I remember the day after she moved in with us. My
teacher at school was ill, so the relief teacher asked
us to write about what we had done at the
weekend. I burst into tears. How could I write
about getting rid of all my Granny's furniture,
ripping up her carpets, leaving what seemed to me
like an empty house, a ghost home, knowing that I
would never see it all again?
I hated it, and the teacher expected me to write a
story about it! I thought the world had no shame.
My Grandmother had to live with me, in my room,
as she could not look after herself any more and
they did not understand, no-one did, not even me.
But that was then.
It is now some five years later, and I have grown up
and with me the understanding of my
Grandmother's illness. I understand now that she
did not kow where she was any more, that she did
not know who I was any more and she simply did
not know who she was any more. I understand all
these things happened, but I do not understand why
they had to happen to my Grandmother.
My Grandmother, a tall woman, well-built but not
fat, always smartly dressed with a warm, loving
glow on her face, her hair perfect, a mass of curls
all shiny like silver when the light hit them.
My Granny.

PAISLEY PATTERNS
When poet Janet Paisley visited Liberton High School roving reporters
Gillian Nelson and Donna Nicholson interviewed her about her life, her
work and everything...
Q) Where do you get your ideas from?
A) A lot from my own life. Most writers probably do that, but that
doesn't mean that everything I write is from scenes from my own life. An
awful lot comes from creating other characters and imagining what it's
like to stand in their shoes, to see life through their eyes.
Q) Are you working on a particular poem at the moment?
A) Not just now. I tend to write quite quickly. I would know if there
was a poem lying around it would be in a fairly finished state. It was a
couple of weeks ago that I wrote my last poem, Drumming the Bones. I got
the idea from a picture that stayed in my head. It was a man carrying
his child, but it was dead. I wrote a poem about it because it stayed in
my mind.
Q) Who is your favourite poet?
A) I don't think I have a favourite poet. I have lots of favourite
poets, different writers. Norman MacCaig, he's Scottish; there are a
number of his poems that I like a big deal.
Q) Do you have a favourite poem?
A) I think it would be harder to choose a particular favourite.
There's a really tiny one about a toad. It's a very short poem, but I
love it - like a lot of MacCaig's poems. He's got a lovely poem about a
neighbour which has a line in it: ''Does his wife know she married a
diagram?'' I could see this man - he was so precise.
Q) If you had three wishes as a writer what would they be?
A) More time to write. It's got to do with that feeling that you get
when you know that that piece is good. It is important to you. And then
I suppose, I would like everyone to like my poems.
Now Neil Whyte and Brooke Mackay-Brock share their views on working
with a ''real'' writer.
We really enjoyed working with Janet. It was good fun. She shared lots
of her own stories with us and treated us like grown-ups. It was good
that she didn't patronise us - it meant we related to her better. She
really helped us express ourselves fluently and, unlike us, she never
seemed to run out of ideas!

Old man on the street,
Cold and alone, begging.
Has he no home?
Where does he stay?
The rain pours. Why
Does he not go in?
Other people on the street,
But this man is different.
He wears a ripped jacket,
Threadbare trousers and scruffy boots.
I feel sorry for him,
Wish I could help but
Don't know how.

THE Labour Party yesterday blamed the job losses at Unigate on the
Government's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board but this is too
simplistic. The delivery market would have declined rapidly anyway
because of the price differential with supermarkets, whose costs of
selling milk are far less than those of the milkman. In addition the
product is treated as a loss leader, with competition forcing stores to
make little if any margin on fresh milk.
Many people also find it more convenient to buy their milk in larger
quantities at their weekly supermarket shop and in households where both
partners work, having milk left on the doorstep only encourages
burglars.
However it is yet another example of economic factors destroying a
tradition which was of great benefit to sections of society, notably the
elderly. Unigate sees the market share of delivered milk dwindling from
the current 44% to 25% within three years.
Unigate has set aside #55m to pay for the changes ahead and before
this charge its profits were 3% up at #116.6m for the year to March.
This performance was better than the stock market had expected and
Unigate shares slipped just 3p to 401p. Dividends still go up, by 5% to
18.2p after a final of 11.9p.
The aim is to reduce bottling capacity by 40% over three years, as
well as rationalising St Ivel dairy products and the Wincanton haulage
activities.
The dairy industry as a whole is outraged by the advent of Milk
Marque, which Unigate chief executive Ross Buckland described as an
''inadequately regulated yet dominant'' supplier of milk, a view with
which Northern Foods' Chris Haskins would heartily concur. Mr Buckland
will continue to press for a ''more equitable'' system of buying milk,
though he conceded that the fall in sterling has eased the threat of
imports.
Unigate is now looking to expansion in Europe, where earlier this year
it bought two milk product companies in France. More purchases will
follow. Mr Buckland has experience of continental business through his
previous job as head of Kellogg Europe.
Despite the problems in the sector, Unigate Dairies suffered only a 7%
fall in operating profits to #38.4m. Milk volumes were just 3% down with
supermarket sales offsetting lower delivered sales.
Greater operating efficiency, new products and the benefits of
previous investment helped fresh foods to a 29% rise to #34m. St Ivel
did better despite a 6% rise in marketing costs. Cheese margins suffered
from its higher raw material costs but this was partly recouped through
rising volumes and the trend towards more mature and value-added cheese.
Wincanton, the transport or in the current jargon the logistics
business earned a little more at #22m in a competitive market, where it
gained new business and invested heavily to meet changing customer
requirements.
The American restaurant business, which sits oddly in the group
portfolio, had profits tumbling 28% to #9.2m and steps to improve
performance are apparently bearing fruit. A more likely candidate for
disposal at this stage is the Nutricia associate. This could raise some
#280m and provide resources to broaden further its dairying base.
Analysts see this year's Unigate profits being flat but the shares
should be able to hold their own, selling at under 11 times earnings and
yielding 5.7%.

THERE will be new faces all round in the Scottish international set-up
next season. Team manager Duncan Paterson and coach Douglas Morgan
confirmed yesterday they will join captain Gavin Hastings in retirement.
The new management and coaching structure will be in place by the
start of next season and Paterson is preparing a report for Murrayfield
on how he views the way ahead.
After their quarter-final defeat by the All Blacks on Sunday, the
Scottish RWC squad, minus Hastings who will stay on in South Africa with
the possibility of doing television work, will leave for home today.
Iain Morrison, the London Scottish flanker, and Heriot's FP hooker Kenny
Milne also confirmed yesterday they have played their last games for
Scotland.
Rob Wainwright remains the most likely candidate to succeed Hastings
as captain although a decision will not be made until nearer the start
of the international season in October when the Western Samoans tour
Scotland.
So far as the identity of the new manager is concerned, there is
on-going debate within the Scottish Rugby Union as to how the position
should be filled. Yesterday, Paterson repeated the point he made in The
Herald two months ago which was that his successor should be appointed
full-time.
There are numerous in-house candidates. Ex-international referee Allan
Hosie, A team manager Arthur Hastie, of Kelso, who has managed this
month's development tour to Zimbabwe, Murrayfield committee-man Charlie
Bissett, and even retiring coach Morgan are among the front-runners.
Yesterday, Paterson said he hoped Morgan's expertise would not be lost
to the union but, in terms of his successor, he added: ''We have to get
the best available. There's a lot of talent around, but if we have to go
outside then I would like to think we are far-sighted enough to do
that.''
Morgan said he had made his decision to retire as coach before the
season started. ''It has been a tremendous four or five months, but I've
been with the squad for five or six years now and it is time to move
on,'' he said.
The former Scotland and British Lions scrum half added: ''I can't see
myself being entirely out of the game after 30 years, but it would be
nice to get a breathing space.''
He said his club, Stewart's-Melville FP, had been inquiring about his
availability before the start of the World Cup.
So far as the new coaching team is concerned, assistant coach Richie
Dixon, who is responsible for the forwards, is keen to continue.
Retiring SRU president Ken Smith told The Herald this week that
continuity was something which the union was striving for, which seems
to indicate the A team coach, former international centre David
Johnston, would be a welcome addition to the coaching staff of the full
international team.
Paterson yesterday took stock of Scotland RWC campaign. ''I said
before we came away that we did not want to stall and that our aim was
to remain in the top six in the world. I think that we are still
there,'' he said.
However, he called for a more enlightened approach back home if that
position was to be sustained.
''We have to take stock of our position in world terms. The All
Blacks, for instance, are playing at a level, week in and week out, that
our guys just do not reach.
''Because they are playing pressure rugby every weekend they do things
instinctively. We have done reasonably well out here, but we really have
to get our guys playing consistently at a higher level than they do just
now.''
The manager said the new league and cup structure would help, but it
was crucial that Scotland's international players were exposed to top
rugby on a regular basis.
Paterson is an advocate of more district rugby, along the lines of the
Kiwi provincial system but, he added: ''Everybody has been caught up in
the atmosphere of the World Cup but once we get home, clubs will start
looking after their own interests again.''
He said: ''In terms of putting a Scottish international side on the
pitch I don't think that most people realise how difficult it is.''
Hastings said his retirement from the international game had not yet
sunk in. ''I'm quite enjoying it actually,'' he admitted. ''This has
been a great year to be involved with Scottish rugby and I'm looking
forward to playing for Watsonians next season in the league, and for
Edinburgh and then, maybe, the cup.''
Hastings said he could foresee vast changes in the game. ''My
definition of a professional is someone who does not have a full-time
job. Whether they get paid for playing of for making personal
appearances, and so on, does not really matter,'' he explained.
''There are not many in this Scottish squad without a job, but I
wonder how many you could say that about in the South African, New
Zealand, or Australian teams. I think the game will have to go with the
flow and there is no way that is going to be turned back.''
Hastings said he hoped at some time in the future there would be a
role for him in the Scottish international regime and that his
experience would not be lost.
* THE RWC semi-finals will be refereed by Derek Bevan, of Wales, and
Stephen Hilditch, of Ireland.
Bevan will handle the game against South Africa and France in Durban
on Saturday while Hilditch will be in charge of the match between New
Zealand and England in Cape Town on Sunday.
Jim Fleming, of Scotland, who had charge of the torrid game between
the Springboks and Western Samoa at the weekend, is to be reserve
touch-judge at Durban.
* THE plan by millionaire businessman John Connor to pump big
financial resources into a Scottish club with the aim of rivalling the
cash clout of the major English clubs is close to completion. Connor,
who runs the waste-paper recycling operation Stirling Fibres, has been
negotiating with Boroughmuir and Watsonians.
Yesterday, he declined to say which, but it is understood that
Watsonians are favourites. He said: ''We expect to be able to make an
official announcement soon, perhaps in the first week of July.''

WHAT exactly do the initials CSV stand for? Well, if you don't already
know, they stand for Community Service Volunteer.
Which isn't some form of punishment, in fact it's quite the opposite.
It's a chance for people between 16 and 35, who have at least four
months to spare and can provide full-time commitment, to ''take time
out''.
Whether it's between jobs, as a taster in something which may interest
you as a career, or if you just feel you need time (between four months
and one year) away from home to try your hand at something new, CSV is a
good idea, and the work can prove to be quite rewarding.
My name is Mitchell, and I'm an 18-year-old from Livingston, West
Lothian, who has been working as a CSV in Glasgow.
When I first started as a CSV in October last year, I had no idea of
the work that lay ahead of me, but was willing to accept the challenge
of anything new.
Now, after having worked for four months with disabled people, one in
particular, at the Southbrae Centre in Jordanhill, Glasgow, my eyes have
really been opened by the work that goes on for disabled people by
dedicated professionals and amateurs alike.
The whole CSV process started with a simple application form, which
had to be completed and returned. Then an interview was arranged, to
help the project co-ordinators establish a ''profile'' of me, to
discover which type of work I was most suited to.
Once the profile had been written, it was just a matter of waiting
until they found a project which was appropriate to the type of work I
was hoping to do. Then, once they found a project suited to me, they
sent me a ''profile'' to look over carefully, and decide whether to
accept.
I did accept, and my life as a CSV started on October 25, 1994, with a
meeting with the staff at the Southbrae Centre and the man I would be
looking after, Alex Hendrie.
Alex, who is 41, has cerebral palsy. He cannot speak, other than
answering questions through eye-movement, and is confined to a
wheelchair.
He uses a Light-Talker, which is a kind of talking computer, operated
by a head switch, which enables him to use everyday words and phrases,
thus allowing him to hold basic conversations. Alex, who is currently
further developing the use of his Light-Talker at Motherwell College,
said that having a CSV has certainly changed his life for the better.
Since leaving my CSV placement in Glasgow, I have started another
project in the Fife region. This involves working with a whole range of
people rather than on a one-to-one basis, which I find I prefer.
One of the people I world with is Billy McColl, and we go out and
about together. Billy tells me he, too, is benefiting from having a CSV.
My reasons for becoming a CSV were to find out at first-hand what it
was like to live away from home and to discover what a full-time
''working environment'' was like. I had never had a full-time job and
had not long left school when I received my placement, so I really was
doing this for the first time.
However, I soon landed on my feet and discovered that independence
isn't such a bad thing, provided you have just a little bit of common
sense.
Although this is voluntary work, CSV's do receive a weekly cheque to
pay for food, travel and a little pocket money. If, like me, you have
never learned how to budget on just over #60 a week, then here is a
breakdown:
Food #26.50
Travel #12.70
Pocket money #22.00
Total #61.20
Now you might not think that #26.50 seems very much for one week's
groceries, but in fact it is enough if you know what to look for.
Indeed, when I first started to do my weekly shop, I had hardly any idea
that there were so many bargains to be had, especially since the
introduction of the major supermarkets' own-brand products, which
include such things as inexpensive beans and bread, a must for a young
person living away from home and cooking for themselves. And as somebody
once said: ''It pays to shop around''.
On occasion the budget may run a little bit low, for example CSV hold
monthly social events for CSV's in the area, whether it be to a pub or a
club, the ice-rink or even ten-pin bowling, it can be a financial strain
if you are not careful with your cash. Indeed, as someone else once
said, ''You look after the pennies and the pounds will look after
themselves''.
If, like I was, you are uncertain as to what you want to do in life,
or if you want to take up the challenge of starting something new, then
I would thoroughly recommend CSV as a kind of starting block.
Types of work covered by CSV.
1. Volunteer Programme -- this allows everyone aged 16-35 to
experience the excitement and reward of becoming a volunteer. Each year,
more than 3000 CSV's nationwide work with those who need their help.
This type of work is mostly full-time and mostly away from home. I am
currently on the Volunteer Programme. This is their main project.
2. Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme -- a chance for the
''older'' members of the community to harness their lifetime experience
and be placed with a local community-based project which needs their
help.
3. Education -- young people are given help to tackle community
problems as part of their studies, for example setting up recycling
projects or building gardens for elderly people. Through this project
over 5000 undergraduates volunteer in schools nationwide, working with
teachers to help pupils achieve more.
4. Training and Enterprise -- unemployed people are trained for
careers in various industries. Training is tailored to trainees' needs
and local labour markets.
5. Media -- through partnership with over 50 radio and television
stations, CSV Media informs millions of people about issues which affect
them today -- from HIV and AIDS, to advice on benefits. CSV Media is the
largest media training agency in the UK.
6. Environment -- people become involved in improving and protecting
their local environment. Action Earth campaigns for environmental action
at Christmas.
So you see, whether you're 16 or 60, old or young, CSV might just be
the breath of fresh air you've been looking for. Go on, give them a
call, and make someone else happy. You never know, you just might like
it!

Scotland 0, Brazil 4
BRAZIL'S emerging stars handed Scotland a footballing lesson last
night as they swept into the final of the Toulon Under-21 tournament.
There was never the remotest chance that the Scots would record a
first victory over the South Americans on the international stage.
Scotland were sunk by two superb goals within the opening 18 minutes
as Brazil emphatically demonstrated that the successors to the reigning
world champions are waiting in the wings.
The gulf between the two nations was repeatedly underlined as the
Brazilians went through their entire range of mesmerising skills at Le
Pontet. By contrast the Scots were rarely allowed to threaten.
Strikers Caico and Leonardo along with playmaker Juninho, all destined
to become major talents, led the slaughter and Scotland coach Craig
Brown was there to witness the task which confronts him as he attempts
to catch up with the world's best.
The Scots best chance came after six minutes when Dundee striker Jim
Hamilton, making his first appearance in the event, was fouled on the
edge of the area.
Clyde midfield player Martin O'Neill found Doug Freedman with the
free-kick but the unmarked Barnet striker headed wide from eight yards.
Scotland paid the price for that miss four minutes later when Leonardo
exploited slack marking to release his Internacional team-mate, Caico,
who exploded a 25-yard drive beyond keeper Derek Stillie.
The South Americans added another after 18 minutes when the Scots were
unable to clear a corner and Juninho turned Hannah before delivering an
incredible 18-yard drive into the top corner of the net from the
tightest of angles.
Manager Tommy Craig switched Jamie Fullarton to left back and pushed
Stuart Gray into midfield to try and contain the menace of Leonardo.
But by then the damage had been done and just before the interval
Juninho flashed a 40-yard free-kick narrowly past the near post.
Colin McDonald and Steve Crawford replaced Stephen Glass and Freedman
after the break but there was no stopping the boys from Brazil. In 58
minutes Caico ripped apart the Scots defence to set up Leonardo for the
third goal.
Almost immediately Celtic's Brian McLaughlin replaced Jamie Fullarton
but still the South Americans reigned supreme.
That domination threatened to become a rout when a thrilling run on
the right by Leonardo ended with Fulham defender Duncan Jupp turning the
ball past his keeper for an own goal which ended Scotland's night of
agony.
Later, Craig praised the Brazilian performance as the best he had seen
at under-21 level and he called for everyone involved in the Scottish
game to learn from the brilliant Brazilians.
''They play this game with smiles on their faces. That is what makes
them different from anyone else in the world.
''Not only do they possess individual brilliance but they also have a
collective genius. When you put the two together it is quite
frightening.
''I am delighted we got this opportunity to play Brazil and my players
will learn from this game.''
Brazil, who have not lost a goal in the tournament, meet France in
tomorrow night's final after the host nation had beaten England 2-0 in
the other semi-final.
SCOTLAND -- Stillie (Aberdeen), Jupp (Fulham), Pressley (Coventry),
Dailly (Dundee United), Gray (Celtic), O'Neill (Clyde), Hannah (Dundee
United), Fullarton (St Mirren), Glass (Aberdeen); Hamilton (Dundee),
Freedman (Barnet).

RAITH Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl took one step nearer taking charge
at Norwich after he was shown around the Canaries' ground and their
extensive training facilities at Colney by chairman Robert Chase
yesterday. Nicholl was non-committal about whether he will accept the
East Anglian club's offer to fill the space left vacant when John Deehan
was sacked in April but said that he was impressed by everything he had
seen.
The former Manchester United and Rangers player will think things over
today and let the Fife club chairman, Alex Penman, know his decision
before his future is known.
The Norwich chairman, who had apparently indicated to journalists in
the south of France on Sunday that the deal to take Nicholl south was
already done, was back-tracking from that position yesterday, claiming
that he was one of four candidates for the job.
However, it seems certain that if Nicholl wants the position it will
be his. Chase admitted that the clubs had agreed a compensation fee,
adding: ''That is normal practice when you want to speak to a manager of
another club.''
* LAZIO have decided against selling striker Giuseppe Signori to Parma
after irate fans marched through Rome and besieged the club's
administrative headquarters.
Lazio president Dino Zoff told a hastily called news conference
yesterday that Signori had been ''taken off the market.''
He said club owner Sergio Cragnotti was threatening to sell his
majority stake in the Rome outfit because of the fans' behaviour.
Cragnotti had said he would accept a #10m bid from Parma but he failed
to forsee the fans' wrath.
Signori, an Italian World Cup player, club captain, and the most
consistent marksman in the top flight over the past three seasons, is a
hero to many Lazio fans.
But Cragnotti said: ''This is the moment to use your head rather than
listen to your heart.'' He said he would have used the money to
strengthen the Lazio squad.
* BLACKBURN owner Jack Walker wants Alan Shearer to stay at Ewood Park
-- for life.
In an bid to frighten off any would-be buyers from home or abroad,
Walker said: ''Whatever it takes to keep Alan Shearer at Ewood Park,
I'll do it.''
Walker's close personal relationship with Shearer could be a key
factor in tempting the England ace into a long-term contract with the
Premiership champions.

<HEADLINE>United dismiss the Ferguson Inter link</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>35</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977911953</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER United chairman Martin Edwards yesterday dismissed
speculation that Italian giants Inter Milan were planning to swoop for
manager Alex Ferguson.
Multi-millionaire Inter chairman Massimo Moratti is poised to complete
the #8m signing of United's England midfielder Paul Ince, although
personal terms still have to be finalised.
It was claimed that he had decided Ferguson also could be lured away
from Old Trafford, to replace Ottavio Bianchi. The carrot for
53-year-old Ferguson was reported to be wages of #1m-a-year, dwarfing
his current salary of around #300,000.
But Edwards said yesterday that he did not believe there was any
substance to the reports.
''I spent a couple of days with Inter Milan representatives
negotiating the Paul Ince deal and nothing was mentioned regarding Alex
Ferguson at all,'' said the United chairman. ''If there was something in
the air, it would surely have been mentioned then.''
While United's failure to land any silverware this season was a huge
disappointment, Ferguson's achievements since lifting the FA Cup in 1990
have made him the club's most successful manager since Sir Matt Busby.
Edwards added: ''The last thing we do at this football club is comment
on speculation and rumours. Irrespective of that, Alex Ferguson is under
contract and I don't think it's an issue. I am also not expecting an
approach of any nature.''

<HEADLINE>Smith and Venables in same quest for flair England need Gascoigne to come of age</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES TRAYNOR, CHIEF SPORTS WRITER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>35</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>

<TEXT>
IT WILL have to be Gascoigne. England's manager Terry Venables must
inject his midfield with flair and creativity, and since he seems
absolutely resolute in his determination to ignore Matthew Le Tissier,
the responsibility lies with a player whose new hairstyle makes him look
more like Eurotrash's Jean Paul Gaultier.
Scary, isn't it? England and Rangers, two sides with ideas and
ambitions which probably exceed their capabilities, are about to rely
heavily on a 28-year-old who has still to prove he has left his
childhood behind.
Of course, if Venables and Walter Smith have rediscovered Paul
Gascoigne, they may both enjoy success beyond their own dreams, but if
they have landed themselves with the one known as Gazza, they will be in
trouble. Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? Impossible to tell with Gascoigne.
However, it is certain Gascoigne's play can be sublime when he is
perfectly balanced in mind and body. He is probably the one player, as
he proved in his brief appearance as a substitute against Brazil in
England's 3-1 defeat at Wembley on Sunday, who can supply the variations
needed at international level. Even Pele, who watched the game, was
impressed.
''He looked to me like a player who can change the pace, the rhythm,''
the great one said. ''England did not have anyone able to direct or
influence the midfield. There was no thoughtful player.''
Gascoigne as the deep thinker is a difficult concept for even the most
liberal mind to accommodate, yet he is Venables' boy. Gascoigne when fit
will be expected to control England's midfield from a central role.
David Platt also will be one of the first names on the team sheet and
that means Le Tissier, who many believe should be a cornerstone of the
international team, will have to flit around the fringes of the group.
Chris Waddle believes the Southampton player is destined to be
sacrificed to a system.
''Le Tissier will probably suffer because of the way the manager wants
to play,'' he said. ''It happened to Tony Currie and it happened to
Glenn Hoddle.''
In fact, the same fate befell many talented English players. Alan
Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Martin Chivers, Charlie George, Peter Osgood, Stan
Bowles, and even Jimmy Greaves, who was jettisoned by Alf Ramsey, who
preferred a system which could not accommodate a natural goal-scorer.
The list of those neglected because of the pragmatism and dedication to
functional systems of English managers is lengthy.
A banner proclaiming: ''Brazil would play Le Tiss'' fluttered among
the Brazilian fans at Wembley, but Venables is likely to remain unmoved.
Le Tissier is a player who needs to be encouraged and wanted before he
can produce his best and the national team manager is already playing
mentor to another fragile temperament in Gascoigne.
It would be difficult and perhaps counter-productive to play both,
because neither is a holding player and every team needs someone in
midfield who can sit in, taking the ball and playing it on. Dunga is the
perfect exponent of this particular art.
The Brazilian captain used to run his own one-man protection racket in
front of his defence and he has added sharp passing to his game. He is
constantly available and his deft touches bring other, more creative
players into play.
Perhaps Venables feels Paul Ince could do the job, but he couldn't be
trusted because his instincts are to move forward. Sunday afternoon
strengthened the case for another, David Batty, who had an excellent
first half, during which he broke down attacks and passed the ball on
with an accuracy often overlooked by his critics.
Graeme Le Saux, playing in front of Stuart Pearce on the left flank,
also looked comfortable, all of which suggests Venables will revert to
his 4-5-1 formation, with Alan Shearer up front and Platt darting around
in support just behind.
Whatever he does, Venables will have to inject greater flair and offer
Shearer more opportunities to score. Against Brazil, the Blackburn
Rovers striker had few chances against the Brazilian defence to enhance
his reputation which has already spread throughout Europe.
It is being said he will be lured to Italy when his contract with
Blackburn ends next year, and the companies which woo top-flight
footballers are lined up. Shearer has just signed a boot deal for #2.5m
and within the Ewood dressing room is referred to as Shear-gold.
However, there is no point in having a free-scoring individual only to
deny him the ball, and that brings us back to Gascoigne.
''He may be the answer,'' said former Celtic player Paul Elliott.
''But we also have to recognise how far behind England are. Brazil
showed us all with their passing and movement that there is a long way
to go.''
Marcio Santos, one of the defenders who kept Shearer quiet, yesterday
signed for Ajax, who paid Fiorentina #2.13m. It is an unusual step for
the Dutch side, who normally rear their own, but then Brazilian players
tend to be closer to the finished product than anyone else.

SWEDEN'S Maria Hjorth, a student at Stirling University, could well be
the best bet for a Scottish win, however tenuous, at the Women's British
Open Amateur Golf Championship which begins at Royal Portrush today.
If her form in the past few months is anything to go by, with
victories in both the Helen Holm Scottish Strokeplay Championship and
the St Rule Trophy, she could pip her native Scottish rivals at the
post, as well as hopefuls from further afield.
US scholarship students and Curtis Cup players Janice Moodie and
Mhairi McKay and last year's Laing Order of Merit winner Alison Rose,
will also have a strong chance of adding their name to the list of
winners who have won the championship at the Northern Ireland venue,
including Joyce Wethered, Lady Margaret Scott, and Catherine Lacoste.

SIX batsmen chalked up centuries on the final day of a rain-hit round
of Britannic Assurance County Championship clashes.
England candidates Jason Gallian and John Crawley both reached three
figures but Lancashire had to be satisfied with a draw against Glamorgan
at Old Trafford.
Gallian made 158 (seventeen 4s and a 6) and Crawley 108 off 167
deliveries (thirteen 4s) as Lancashire warmed up for today's Benson &amp;
Hedges Cup semi-final with Worcestershire by reaching 338 for three
declared. But Matthew Maynard responded with 67 as Glamorgan held out.
Worcestershire beat Nottinghamshire by three wickets at Trent Bridge,
where Australian Tom Moody made 106 off 101 balls (fifteen 4s), and
Gavin Haynes added 55.
Somerset boosted their confidence before today's other B&amp;H semi-final,
against Kent, with a five-wicket win over Surrey at The Oval thanks to
Peter Bowler's unbeaten 132, which included fifteen 4s and two 6s. Mark
Lathwell made 75 and Graham Rose 51.
Kent lost to Gloucestershire by 104 runs at Canterbury despite Mark
Benson's 102.
Roger Twose hit a marathon 131 to steer second-placed Warwickshire to
a draw against Sussex at Edgbaston. He was at the crease for seven hours
and 34 minutes, facing 359 balls and hitting eighteen 4s.
On a generally poor day for bowlers, Alan Walker completed the best
figures of the season -- six for 59 and match figures of 14 for 177
against Essex -- but could not help Durham to avoid a sixth successive
defeat.

BRITAIN'S Jeremy Bates and Chris Wilkinson were involved in a ball
controversy when the Stella Artois tournament began in wintry conditions
at London's Queen's Club yesterday.
Bates coasted to a 6-4, 6-3 first-round victory over German Markus
Zoecke but Wilkinson admitted he was ''pathetic'' in a 6-4, 6-0 defeat
by American Tommy Ho.
Both Britons criticised the Barnsley-made, heavier Slazenger balls,
which will also be used at Wimbledon.
Bates said: ''These balls are flat and slow down my second service
even further. They are absolutely dire. Sometimes you hit the ball and
nothing happens.
''Markus was talking to the umpire non-stop about it during our
match.''
The 6ft 5in Zoecke was despondent after having seen his normally
potent serve blunted by the balls and lush grass. ''If they tried to
make these balls slow they succeeded,'' he said. ''Normally I serve five
or six aces per set, but this time I was down to one or two.
''You hit it as hard as you can and nothing happens. Maybe when it is
sunny it would be time to change balls. But not on a cold, damp day like
this.''
Wilkinson said: ''The balls are very slow. I need all the help I can
get from a bit of pace.
''It's much more difficult to hit big, hard winners because the ball
has a 'ploppy' effect when it hits the racket. But I suppose if the big
servers are less dominant, it will be a good thing -- I can't blame my
defeat completely on the balls. I was pathetic.''
The Lawn Tennis Association and International Tennis Federation have
been conducting experiments aimed at producing a ''slower'' ball to
combat the big-servers and encourage longer rallies.
Tournament director Ian Wight said: ''Slazenger tell us the pressure
of the balls has been reduced marginally.
''They have been used in practice here for three days and only Boris
Becker commented on them. He felt they were slightly heavier. But today
was one of those cold, damp days.
''Whether the reduction of pressure will have the same effect when the
sun shines, who knows?''

CAPE Town is sunny, and whereas a hungover English camp greeted the
clear blue skies with smiles, the Australians were altogether more
restrained in the aftermath of their defeat.
Hatchets were buried on Sunday night as the Aussies, magnanimous in
defeat despite Will Carling's bombshell about the retiral of David
Campese, had gone over to the English at the aftermatch function to
offer their congratulations to a man.
But in the cold light of a clear South African winter's day, as they
say, it was time to analyse England's win.
Jeremy Guscott swallowed on his drouth. ''The days of men weaving
through tackles and running the length of the pitch to score have gone
now,'' he said.
He's right, and one thing this World Cup has not seen when
well-balanced sides come together is an abundance of easy tries.
''When Tony Underwood went on that run for his try it was just
awesome, but that happens less and less. We do want to play a
fifteen-man game, but it is very difficult. It was almost like playing
at Twickenham with all that crowd noise. When Rob Andrew's drop goal
went over it was one of the greatest moments of my life. I knew from the
moment he hit it that it had gone through.''
One of England's problems, without a doubt, is their PR.
For all that they undoubtedly have one of the best teams in this
tournament, they possess a singular lack of ability to grasp the fact
that putting on a friendly and civil public face is part and parcel of
the modern rugby outfit.
They cannot conceive themselves as being anything other than disliked
and, yet, it was quite obvious that the locals wanted England to beat
the Aussies.
''You're the bloke that writes those pro-English articles,'' said
Colin Herridge, the media liaison official.
I smiled demurely wondering where Brian Moore was. Moore, give him
credit, is the ultra competitor and without him England are a much
easier prospect.
I like Will Carling, but to see him operate at a press conference, or
to see him brush off a Radio 5 chappie, is to see a spoiled little child
at work.
The England captain, sipping mineral water and surrounded by cameras
and a posse of English pressmen, spoke of the effect of the defeat of
Australia on his team.
''The guys are a bit shell-shocked,'' he said. ''We have to be careful
that we don't let things go to our heads. The biggest battle we now have
is the mental one.''
The last time his side were over here they pulled off a similar shock
victory, against Francois Pienaar's South Africans, only to see the
second Test slip from their grasp in over-confidence.
Up at the Australian hotel, I had a few quiet moments with their
affable coaches, the two Bobs, Templeton and Dwyer, still trying to come
to terms with the ramifications of being knocked out of the tournament.
''What do you make of England then?'' asked Dwyer, quite obviously not
a fan of the English pattern.
His eyes went skywards in an arc as if following the imaginary line of
yet another up and under.
In a nutshell, Dwyer thinks that the English are boring, and do the
game a disservice with their lack of willingness to attack with the ball
in hand, although it was Australia's problem that they were unable to
win the ball in the first place.
''I was a bit upset at it all,'' said Dwyer. ''We had a gameplan to
run the ball at Carling and Guscott, but the players just didn't do
it.''
''I don't think that we could beat Scotland at the moment. I am very
impressed at the way they are playing, especially the forwards who get
there in a blanket.''
It has been uneasy watching the Australians fall from grace in such
spectacular fashion, but we are in an era in which the good teams are
very close to each other in standard.
''We should have won,'' said Templeton, the forward coach, puffing on
a restful early morning cigarette. Tempo is a character.
''Our little scrum half, Gregan, didn't play all that well, did he?
Tim Horan says that if Michael Lynagh hadn't dropped the pass that gave
Tony Underwood his try then he was through the gap. That's how close
these games are.''
Modern top-level rugby seems so much more than a game of give and get
now, and to see these highly tuned athletes, and intelligent coaches, so
devastated physically and mentally in the aftermath of confrontations
such as these reminds you of the devastating toll these games take on a
country's finest.
But there was humour too. Dean Richards had his forehead scar for all
to see.
''Done by one of our own chaps,'' he said. ''Dirty team we are you
know.''
The All Blacks, certainly, will be interested in that.

* BARRY Scott, of Lochmaben, won three competitions on the one day at
three different courses and picked up first prizes at the lot, writes
Douglas Lowe.
The 23-year-old scratch man, a window fitter, began at 6am at Dumfries
and Galloway and won first scratch prize with a five-under-par 63 in
partnership with Muir Townsley (Dumfries &amp; County) in the Cruachan Cup,
a fourball strokeplay event.
Then it was on to his home course for an 11.25am start in the Texas
Scramble which was the first official competition over the new 18-hole
course. He teamed up with Jack Graham (handicap 16), Russell Marchant
(24), and Stuart Wight (28) and shot an 11-under-par 55 -- less a
combined handicap of six -- to win by six.
Finally, he teed off at 4.20pm in the M B Gass Trophy, an open scratch
competition, and a level-par 71 did the trick there.
After picking up the trophy he returned hotfoot to Lochmaben, where
prizegiving had been delayed for his benefit. Townsley collected on his
behalf at Dumfries.
* GORDON Law, of Uphall, led the qualifiers for the Northern Open at
Nairn yesterday with a four-under-par 68.Leading scores:

* MELANIE Neef, who made her first senior outdoor appearance for Great
Britain in last year's European Cup final, will carry much greater
responsibility when she lines up for this year's contest a week on
Saturday and Sunday, writes Doug Gillon.
Neef paid tribute to the way in which British team captain Sally
Gunnell, the grand slam 400 metres hurdles champion, nursed her through
that debut appearance, and helped take the pressure off for the relay,
upon which World Cup qualification depended.
But when this year's cup team was announced, Gunnell's name was
absent. The Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth hurdles champion
is nursing a heel injury which threatens the defence of her world crown.
Neef, Britain's fastest over one lap this year (52.22sec) was named
for the 400m in the one-per-event contest, and is now the woman to whom
the relay squad will turn for reassurance. A finalist in both European
and Commonwealth championships last year, the Scot may now assume the
anchor role which previously was Gunnell's.
Gunnell, who had to opt out of UK indoor matches last winter with a
heel problem, has been advised that she is unlikely to be race-fit
before the end of July. The World Championships begin in Gothenburg on
August 4.
There is not one Scottish male in the cup team, but Yvonne Murray and
Liz McColgan, as previously revealed in these columns, have been given
the 5000m and 10,000m berths.

ONLY four teams are left in the Rugby World Cup -- and England captain
Will Carling believes it is now down to ''survival of the fittest.''
''It is survival of the fittest for the last two games and we have
been lucky with injuries,'' said Carling.
''Some other countries have lost players but we will be able to select
from a full squad when we choose the team to play New Zealand in
Sunday's semi-final in Cape Town.''
Despite the passion and ferocity of Sunday's game against Australia,
England's only injury victim was Dean Richards, who has a nasty gash on
his forehead.
While New Zealand coach Laurie Mains says his side are the underdogs,
Carling insists the All Blacks as favourites.
''They are playing as well as anybody and we will have to be more
disciplined than we were against Australia,'' Carling said.
''I have not seen their quarter-final against Scotland but it is
interesting to note that the Scots scored so many points.''
David Campese, who might have won the game for Australia with an
attempted drop goal before Andrew's effort, is delaying making a
decision on his Test future.
Wallabies spokesman Greg Thomas stressed reports that the world's
record try-scorer had played his final match for his country were
premature and that Campese was likely to be available for the
forthcoming series against New Zealand.
Meanwhile, World Cup disciplinary chiefs yesterday gave Western Samoa
full-back Mike Umaga a 90-day suspension for a dangerous tackle during
Saturday's quarter-final defeat against South Africa.
Umaga was not cautioned during the match by Scottish referee Jim
Fleming for his challenge but a statement by World Cup organisers said
the disciplinary commission had decided to suspend him ''after examining
all the evidence and taking into account a previous head-butting
offence.''

GOLF: US OPEN
AMERICAN amateur golf champion Tiger Woods has been thrown in at the
deep end on his US Open debut at Shinnecock Hills, New York. The
19-year-old will partner holder Ernie Els and world No.1 Nick Price in
the first two rounds on Thursday and Friday.
First of the 11 Europeans in action will be David Gilford, followed by
Bernhard Langer, seeking his third successive tournament victory, and
then Nick Faldo.
Faldo, who began his build-up for the second major of the season by
visiting the course last week, tees off with former champion Tom Watson
and Fred Couples. Scotland's Colin Montgomerie has been paired with Tom
Lehman and Phil Mickelson.
Seve Ballesteros, meanwhile, is fighting back trouble yet again. ''The
back is back,'' said the Spanish star, who, like his compatriot Jose
Maria Olazabal, missed the halfway cut in last week's Kemper Open in
Maryland, won by Lee Janzen. The problem did not prevent Ballesteros
practising yesterday. Selected pairings and starting times (GMT,
Thursday first):
12.35, 4.55 - P Stewart, J Daly, B Langer (Germany). 12.55, 5.15 - T
Watson, F Couples, N Faldo (England). 1.15, 5.35 - B Crenshaw, F
Zoeller, I Woosnam (Wales). 1.35, 5.55 - E Els (S Africa), N Price
(Zimbabwe), T Woods, amateur. 4.35, 12.15 - T Lehman, C Montgomerie
(Scotland), P Mickelson. 4.55, 12.35 - S Ballesteros (Spain), S Simpson,
M Calcavecchia. 5.15, 12.55 - L Janzen, H Irwin, B Tway. 5.35, 1.15 - T

ATHLETICS
LINFORD Christie declared last night that he will quit athletics at
the end of the season and not defend his Olympic 100m title in Atlanta
in 1996. The 35-year-old sprinter claimed he was being driven away from
then sport by the Press.
In an emotional outburst on ITV's Sport In Question, screened live, he
said: ''I can't take any more -- I just can't. I'm at the stage where I
am so fed up with it all that I could walk out of the sport any day. I
used to love it, but it doesn't mean that much to me any more. I'm
finishing this season. I'm definitely not going to the Olympic Games.''
Christie's threat to quit comes after a traumatic start to the World
Championship season in which he is due to defend his 100m title in
Gothenburg in August. He has been beaten in four of his first five races
and is deadlocked with the British Athletic Federation over his
financial demands for running in the major domestic meetings.
Yesterday, he was named for the 100m and 200m at the European Cup in
Lille, but the selectors did not confirm him again as captain of the
men's team. Instead, they said the captaincy would be announced later in
the week.
Christie has had a running battle with the Press for years. He claimed
he was not given credit for his achievements, the media was obsessed
with his age and seemed interested only in when he would be retiring. He
added on the programme: ''The British Press are the scourge. There is so
much pressure from the media. They just don't understand.''
Christie, who also holds the European and Commonwealth 100m titles,
criticised the BAF, claiming ''the federation is not in my camp. I
watched the rugby (World Cup) and they were having fun with their
management. We never have fun with ours. It's a sad state of affairs.''
He added: ''Every day I get up I want to walk away from it. It's got
to the stage where athletics is no longer my life. I have other things.
Sometimes you have to call it a day.''
Christie last considered quitting after having been criticised by the
federation's executive chairman, Peter Radford, for behaviour off the
track at last summer's European Championships in Helsinki, but he still
went out to beat the top Americans in Zurich the following week.
Until now he has always suggested that he would bid for a second
Olympic title.

* This week's tip comes from STEVEN DUNSMORE, the professional at
Falkirk Tryst Golf Club.
AT Falkirk Tryst, there are a lot of bunkers with steep faces and so
learning how to escape from them is one of the most sought-after
lessons.
It is women and high-handicappers who have the most trouble, mainly
because they try and get out of bunkers by playing a normal shot.
They keep the feet square, have the ball too far back in the stance,
and then make a flick shot which fails to get the ball out.
The correct set-up is to have the feet open, in other words aiming
left of target. This will create a naturally out-to-in swing. The other
point is to bury the feet in the sand which helps form a firm base from
which to hit the shot.
Then make a swing similar to hitting a full sand-wedge shot from
grass. Hit about an inch behind the ball and give it a good hit, and let
me stress that you must give the ball a really good blast.
So many players hit a flicky shot and leave the ball in the sand.
Hitting hard into the sand behind the ball and following through the
shot will guarantee an escape from even the steepest of bunkers.

FORTH Ports has confirmed that it will bid against Clydeport for the
privatisation of Dundee Port Authority, which may fetch up to #20m.
''Yes, Forth Ports will be submitting a bid,'' a spokesman for the
Leith-based company said yesterday, declining to give further details.
Clydeport announced last month that it had teamed up with the
management of Dundee port to submit its own bid by today's deadline.
Clydeport director Euan Davidson confirmed that this partnership,
called Caledonian Ports, is still in business.
''Caledonian Ports will be submitting a bid,'' he said.
City analysts say Mersey Dock and Harbour Company, which is larger
than either of the two Scottish port operators, may also enter the fray,
giving rise to a three-way tug-of-war when pre-qualification bids close
at 5pm today.
But Mersey Dock, which bought the Medway ports of Chatham and
Sheerness for #103.7m in October 1993, declined to comment on reports
that it was planning to bid for Dundee.
''There has been speculation in a couple of newspapers, but we don't
generally comment on speculation in the media about what we might or
might not be doing,'' a spokesman for the Liverpool-based company said.
City analysts expect Dundee port to sell for between #10m and #20m.
A privatisation committee headed by Stuart Fare, the chairman of
Dundee Port Authority, is expected to spend one to three weeks examining
the preliminary bids.
It will then invite approved bidders to submit final proposals by July
28.
The sale requires the approval of Transport Secretary Brian MaWhinney
and sources involved in the process say it is unlikely to go through
before late August.
Clydeport operates Glasgow, Greenock, Hunterston, and Ardrossan on the
Clyde. Control of Dundee would give the company a strategic foothold on
the East Coast and a chance to develop support facilities for the
offshore oil industry.
Dundee missed out on the North Sea oil boom after Aberdeen established
itself as the main offshore support centre in the 1970s. With the
decline of heavy industry in Dundee its quay frontage is under-used.
''They did not make the most of the commercial opportunities that
might have been open to them,'' Mr Baldwin said.
Nevertheless Dundee port remains a profitable little undertaking.
The port authority made a pre-tax profit of #825,000 in 1993 on
turnover of #5m and moved about one million tonnes of cargo. It employs
95 people.
Results for 1994 have not yet been published.
Forth Ports operates Leith, Granton, and Grangemouth on the south
shore of the Forth and a string of small ports in Fife.
It also forms part of the Rosyth 2000 consortium, which is bidding to
buy the Rosyth Royal Navy dockyard and turn it into a commercial port.
A move north into the Tay would consolidate its stranglehold over port
facilities in South-east Scotland.
''Dundee is at the edge of their area and would be a useful bit of
in-fill,'' said Richard Andrews, a Scottish companies analyst with
Edinburgh brokers Bell, Lawrie, White.
Analysts were divided over whether Mersey Dock would bid.
''They are known to have looked at other ports when they came up for
sale,'' Mr Andrews said.
But Tim Baldwin, a transport analyst at Greig Middleton in London, was
more sceptical, saying Mersey Dock was still digesting its purchase of
the Medway ports in South-east England.
''They are less likely to bid, but I would not rule them out,'' he
said.
About 25 companies have made enquiries about the privatisation of
Dundee port, but analysts say the only other serious bidder might be
Associated British Ports, the UK's largest private port operator.
Like Mersey Dock, ABP has been keeping quiet about its intentions.
''We cannot make any comment either way,'' an spokesman for Associated
British said.
Dundee would represent an opportunity for ABP to expand north of the
Border. At present, the London-based company only operates two Scottish
ports -- Ayr and Troon.
But Associated British has not given any signs that it is on the
acquisition trail.
Its last major purchase was the Red Funnel Line, which operates ferry
services from Southampton to the Isle of Wight, in 1989.

PARBUSTERS
GEORGE Reynolds came within a hair's breadth of beating his
two-year-old course record at Rothesay when his putt from just off the
green at the last lipped the rim of the cup, writes Douglas Lowe.
Still, his gross 62, which features seven birdies and no losses to
par, converts to a Parbusters score of minus four, equalled his previous
mark and tops the men's scratch section of Parbusters this week.
Reynolds, who works for the district council parks department and is
also a part-time fireman, credited precise iron play and long, accurate
driving for his score.
''Four of the birdies were tap-ins and the others came from putts of
no more than 15 feet,'' he said.
His score, however, is unlikely to make the grade for the final as
there are currently six scores posted of minus five or better after
seven of the 16 qualifying weeks.
In women's scratch, two more players, Christina Meldrum and Belle
Robertson, both former finalists, have hit the level mark bringing the
total to six with no-one yet having registered a minus score.
Among the handicappers, minus 10 is the best this week by two players.
This week's leading scores:

<HEADLINE>Irish back parole move but warn on Clegg</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977911970</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Irish Government and Dublin opposition leaders last night welcomed
the British move to relax parole conditions for paramilitary prisoners
in Northern Ireland.
However, Prime Minister John Bruton defended his controversial
''meddling'' in the case of Lee Clegg, the British Army private who may
soon be released.
He signalled his intention to return to the issue at a further meeting
with Mr Major during a European summit in Cannes later this month.
Mr Bruton infuriated some sections of the Conservative Party and
opened up a potential political rift with London by warning that the
early freeing of Private Clegg could damage the peace process if
balancing concessions were not offered to terrorist prisoners in Ulster.
His comments were seen in Dublin as reflecting growing frustration
over the current slow pace of the peace process after nearly 10 months
of terrorist ceasefires in Northern Ireland.
Private Clegg was jailed for life three years ago for shooting Belfast
teenager Karen Reilly, a passenger in a stolen car.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is expected soon to
announce the results of a Life Sentence Review board investigation of
the Clegg case.
When pressed by MPs in the Commons yesterday about the case, Sir
Patrick insisted that the possible changes to remission rates or other
regime changes for prisoners in Northern Ireland or anywhere else in the
UK. which he had announced were not linked with the decision he must
make on whether to free Private Clegg.
He said that the Life Sentence Review Board had considered Private
Clegg's case on June 6: ''I am considering their recommendations and I
will consult the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge as
necessary.''He would reachhis decision  with all practicable speed,'' he
added.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein yesterday accused Britain of endangering the
Northern Ireland peace process.Party cddhairman Mitchel McLaughlin said
the British Government represented the biggest obstacle to peace in
Ireland and he claimed that more and more nationalists were questioning
its commitment to the process.
He said that Sinn Fein would pull out of talks with Ulster's Minister
for Political Development, Michael Ancram, unless Sinn Fein believed the
discussions would be useful.

<HEADLINE>Premier 'clears' Whitehall over Scott report leak</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977911971</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister last night insisted there was no reason to suspect
that the leak to the BBC of a draft report from Sir Richard Scott's
arms-for Iraq inquiry, criticising Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave, came from within Whitehall.
He said in a Commons written reply: ''Inquiries have been undertaken
to establish whether there is any prima facie evidence that there has
been an unauthorised disclosure of the information concerned from within
government.
''On the basis of these inquiries, there is no reason to suppose that
the leak came from within government.''
Mr Major said draft report extracts were sent by Sir Richard to ''a
number of people, some of whom are outside government''.
He insisted in another reply: ''The Government does not disclose
details of correspondence between the inquiry and an individual witness.
In the case of of draft extracts in particular, the inquiry has asked
that these be treated in the strictest confidence.''
Mr Major, in another reply, also disclosed that cost to taxpayers of
providing legal services to Scott inquiry witnesses has topped #500,000.
He said legal advice was available to Ministers, ex-Ministers and
senior civil servants where it was requested by the individual concerned
and where their department's legal adviser or the Treasury Solicitor's
Department agreed the request was reasonable.
''The total cost to the public funds of providing legal services to
witnesses to date is approximately #568,000.
''This figure includes the costs of legal services provided by the
Treasury Solicitor's Department and by external lawyers.
''Some legal advice has also been provided by departmental lawyers as
part of their normal duties. The cost of this advice is not
quantifiable.''
Mr Major said told Labour barrister Gerry Bermingham (St Helens South)
he was unable to give details of the costs to taxpayers of advice from
solicitors or barristers to Ministers, ex-Ministers, civil servants and
Government or ministerial advisers over the inquiry's draft conclusions.
He also rejected a call to name individuals who sought such advice.
''It would not be right to identify the nature of advice given to
particular individuals. This is a matter of confidence between them and
their legal advisers.''
Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's Civil Service spokesman, said later that
the final bill for legal costs could reach several million.
''This half-a-million pound bill to the taxpayer shows that Ministers
and civil servants have no grounds whatsoever to argue that they have
been denied proper legal representation before the Scott inquiry,'' he
said.
''What is most disturbing is that this huge bill is only the latest
estimate. While Ministers take their time to comment on the drafts, the
meter keeps ticking over. At this rate, the final bill for legal costs
could reach several million.''

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday adopted a
carrot-and-stick approach as he held out the prospect of further
concessions to terrorist groups on both sides in Northern Ireland -- and
the possible abandonment of anti-terrorist powers.
He also announced changes allowing more prisoners in Northern Ireland
to be temporarily released on compassionate leave.
In a Commons debate, called to renew the 1989 Northern Ireland
(Emergency Provisions) Act, he drew attention to the progress made
towards peace in the province, but made clear there was much further to
go.
He told MPs that the independent reviewer of the legislation, Mr John
Rowe, QC, had concluded it was necessary to renew each section of the
legisaltion currently in force for a further year, and that this
coincided with the Government's own view.
The Act, among other measures, makes special provision for powers to
stop, to arrest, to search and to seize property, provides for detention
by Order (otherwise known as internment -- a power currently suspended),
and makes special provision for the confiscation of the proceeds of
terrorist activities.
Although the special powers were being used less and less, the latent
threat remained and the Act remained necessary for the time being.
However, as the carrot and stick approach emerged, Sir Patrick said Mr
Rowe had recommended that during the coming year the Act should be kept
under review with a view to suspending individual provisions.
Sir Patrick said: ''This we are happy to accept wholeheartedly. When,
on advice. I consider that a particular provision is no longer necessary
I shall not hesitate to invite the House to approve and Order suspending
it.
''The suspension could at any time be reversed if necessary. It is ,
after all, the Government's aim to remove the provisions altogether in
due course. But Mr Rowe concludes, and we agree, that we have not yet
reached that point.
Further concessions were offered as the Government edges forward in
the peace process, but it was clear they were conditional.
The maximum period of compassionate leave which the Prison Service can
authorise for attendance of a funeral of a close relative is set to go
up from 24 hours to 48.
The rules governing compassionate leave for the serious illness of a
close relative are to be relaxed, and the length of time a prisoner will
have to serve before qualifying for compassionate leave will be reduced
from 10 years to six years.
The Northern Ireland Secretary pledged there would be a wide-ranging
look at all the options for permanent counter-terrorism legislation once
a lasting peace was established in Northern Ireland, and that there
would a powerful, authoritative and independent review of the continuing
need for Northern Ireland prevention of terrorism legislation.
However, he left MPs in no doubt about the Government's determinatipo
hold, if necessary, a hard line, stating: ''It remains the cause that
paramilitaries on both sides, and not only the principal organisations,
are still engaging in terrorist-related activity.
''Both sides seek money and they go after it by robbery, by extortion
with intimidation, by the criminal extraction of money from charities,
from clubs and from ostensibly legitimate businesses. They are involved
increasingly in the drug-trafficking which makes the lives of so many
young people wretched.''
Referring to the so-called punishment attacks, he said: ''The thugs
who perpetrate these sickening crimes often use baseball bats and clubs,
and cudgels with protruding nails, to beat their victims limbs and
torsos, smashing their bones and wrecking their internal organs --
capping this by threatening them with death if they tell the RUC.''
Ministers sometimes were upbraided for going on about such activities
and spoiling the party. ''What is really needed to move the peace
process forward is the ending of actions which rupture or menace the
peace, '' Sir Patrick said.
''Otherwise, how are those who question the compatibility of these
activities with professions of peace to be reassured?''
For Labour, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Dr Marjorie Mowlam told
the Government her party was in agreement on the announcements made on
changes to compassionate leave for prisoners, and acknowledged there had
been progress.
''We put on record our congratulation to members of both Governments,
and particularly the communities in Northern Ireland who have shown such
determination and courage in taking the peace process forward,'' she
said.
However, Dr Mowlam said Labour always had opposed the Emergency Powers
Act and would do so again. Our opposition has been based on the fact
that numerous sections have upset that very delicate balance between
fighting terrorism and protecting basic civil rights.''
The Government's proposals to renew the anti-terrorist powers were
approved by 286 votes to 180, a majority of 96.

reports on the widening appeal of the Scottish International Piano
Competition
THE fourth Scottish International Piano Competition will be held in
Glasgow in September this year, when 53 young pianists from 25 countries
will compete for a place in a final that carries prize money totalling
#25,000.
For the third time the principal sponsor of the competition will be
BT, to the tune of #50,000 and the BT Trophy. Other sponsors include
Scottish Mutual and Glasgow City Council, who are contributing #10,000
each.
The young pianists -- all between 17 and 31 -- are coming to Glasgow
from farther-flung parts of the globe than in earlier competitions,
suggesting that the reputation of the SIPC is spreading. Competitors
will arrive from Australia, China, Japan, Israel, Korea, Venezuela and
America, among many other countries.
They will play before a hefty panel of judges that includes the best
of all British pianists, John Lill, who will bring authority and clarity
to decision-making. The judging panel also includes pianists Abbey
Simon, from America, and Ronald Stevenson, from Scotland.
The format of the competition, which runs over eight days, will be
roughly as before. The opening, eliminatory rounds will be held in the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. In the first, a degree of
flexibility has been introduced into the competitors' choice of
repertoire. The second round will include the mandatory performance of a
newly commissioned work -- this time by Frank Spedding, former member of
staff at the RSAMD.
And the final itself, where competitors will perform a concerto in the
Royal Concert Hall with the RSNO under conductor Christopher Seaman, has
been expanded to allow up to four, rather than three, pianists to
participate.
The competition runs from September 10 to 17, all rounds are open to
the public, and tickets for the final are available now.

THE Monks Investment Trust yesterday revealed it took profits on #107m
worth of gilts in the middle of last week, believing there was little
room for prices to rise any further.
Its decision has since been vindicated, at least in the short-term,
with UK Government bonds having followed US Treasuries downwards in the
second half of last week.
Monks, which is managed by Baillie Gifford, yesterday terminated the
#100m loan facility used to fund the original purchase of the gilts,
only seven months into its five-year term.
The #500m Edinburgh-based fund fully invested these borrowings in 2001
stock at the end of October.
Monks sold these gilts, which made up the greater part of its bond
portfolio, for #107m.
Among the factors which influenced the decision to sell was the belief
that the US economy, which has cooled significantly since the fourth
quarter of last year, will pick up again in the second half.
Other things being equal, this would prompt a bounce in US bond
yields. Monks believes US Treasury yields have already fallen too much.
Any rise in US bond yields and corresponding fall in prices would
probably also weaken gilts.
Stressing that Monks was not ''frightfully bearish'' on gilts, Douglas
McDougall, joint senior partner of Baillie Gifford, said: ''We bought on
a yield of 9% and sold on a yield of 7[1/2]%. We felt that was as much
as we were going to get.
''We also felt American bond yields had come down rather further than
they should.''
Mr McDougall has been surprised by the extent of the slowdown in the
US economy but believes the weak economic data seen recently will be
short-lived.
He said: ''Disposable income is quite strong, monetary policy is quite
easy and consumer confidence is quite high. I would think it is quite
likely that the American economy will begin to pick up again in the
second half of this year.''

YOUR ball lands on a wrong green. Following Rule 25-3 you identify the
nearest point not nearer the correct hole, nor in a hazard, and drop,
without penalty, within one club-length of that point. The ball rolls
back a foot, not nearer the hole, into a position where it is on the
apron of the wrong green, but you must take your stance on the green to
play the shot. Should you redrop?
NO. The ball is in play. Rule 25-3 has been followed to the letter,
and it does seem one rule which should be altered by specifying that
total relief should be taken to minimise spike damage to greens.

MAKING the most of ancient wonder leads all sorts of people down
curious roads. In the days before modern Italian politics toppled into
ruin, Pietro Tidei was a communist. But today in his go-getting lust for
Mammon he, too, has ditched old Carlo Marx in favour of God. Or rather
he has ditched Marxism for spiritual kitschism, for this is the man who
is the mayor of Civitavecchia, the dismal port, north of Rome, which now
faces an upswing in fortune because of a weeping Madonna.
Since February 2, the Roman Catholic feast of the Purification, a
plaster statue of indifferent aesthetic merit has been intermittently
weeping tears of human blood in Civitavecchia. It began in the church of
San Agostino, situated in a run-down quarter known as the Bog. The first
sightings were by Fabio Gregori, an electrician, and his family, who had
received the statue from a priest during a pilgrimage to the Bosnian
shrine of Medjugorje. But then San Agostino's own priest, Father Pablo
Martin, claimed to have observed the tears, his words bringing crowds to
peer at the dark drops encrusted on the Madonna's cheeks.
Of course, there is nothing like a paranormal experience to rattle the
hierarchy. So it wasn't long before the local bishop stepped in,
removing the statue and cloistering it in his home to enable certain
scientific tests to be carried out. But if Bishop Girolamo Grillo had
hoped these investigations and his personal scepticism would end the
matter he had forgotten that the only verities Italy holds dear these
days are either miracles or fraud.
Believing one or the other or indeed both to be happening in
Civitavecchia, thousands of people have continued to journey to the
town, content to stare at the church's empty alcove. Meanwhile the DNA
tests have confirmed that the blood shed is indeed human, and that of a
male. But hokum, rather than heaven, might yet be the cause. Medjugorje
statues have ''wept'' before after a trick powder found within them
turned to liquid in the sunshine. And in Florence there exist artisans
who specialise in tear-duct devices which can easily be inserted into
plaster-cast statues.
Not insignificantly, both Father Martin and the Gregori family have
refused to give blood samples because they insist the police have no
right to probe a religious matter. Maybe it is a symptom of Italy's
present moral turmoil, but no amount of doubt thrown on the Madonna has
subdued the clamour for its return to San Agostino. So, next Saturday,
the statue will be carried back to its grotto amid the full panoply of
carnival and chanted prayer. And the town's leading lapsed communist is
rubbing his hands.
But so far Pietro Tidei's conversion is strictly temporal. Until the
past few months Civitavecchia (population 50,000) had an unemployment
rate of 20%. Now it is fully expecting a second miracle, an economic one
to lift it out of recession. ''Divine intervention was not in our
development plan,'' says Tidei, ''but this Madonna business will go well
with our new amusement park.'' Situated near the ancient Trojan baths,
the leisure complex will consist of waterslides and fake lagoons, and in
his own way Mr Tidei is, no doubt, praying for a holy well. As it is
approval for more hotels has been granted and public land is being
cleared to build five parking lots -- at least 10,000 extra vehicles are
expected to swell Civitavecchia's traffic.
Bishop Grillo's own urgings that no-one should reap profit from the
statue's return to public view thus appear to count for nothing.
Civitavecchia, with hundreds of portable toilets at the ready,
wheelchair provision at every other turn, and even bullet-proof windows
installed in San Agostino, now sees itself in competition with Fatima
and Lourdes.
However, according to historians, Italy was agog with Madonna
sightings after the last World War, as if the country was reacting
against horror and spiritual famine. It is perhaps no coincidence, then,
that Civitavecchia's mystery is taking place against a national backdrop
of corruption, political bankruptcy, and economic chaos. And not far
away the barbarism of Bosnia's strife continues.
Officially, though, the Catholic Church still dismisses this latest
mater doloroso as bogus, the kind of freak show which, one cleric
insists, always happens in a bad summer, so allowing holiday-makers
somewhere new to go. But crying icons, earth tremors, optical illusions
. . . whatever the reason, the phenomenon is catching. In Civitavecchia
during the siesta the other day the hand of a road labourer, leaning on
a shovel, was seen to move twice in half an hour.

DAVID Edgar's Pentecost is a play of prodigious scholarship,
commendably internationalist in scope and understandably received with
acclaim when it opened last season in Stratford. Seeing it now as the
RSC's opening production of their five-month Young Vic residency, you
can't help but be impressed by its breadth in every sense.
A response to the rising tide of European racism, it is set in an
unnamed, East-European (read Balkan) church where cracks in the wall are
beginning to reveal a fresco that may just force the whole of the
history of Western art to be re-evaluated. Conjuring with epic themes on
the value of art, its crossover with politics, cultural and national
identity, language and story-telling, it's also the closest Edgar has
yet come to including spiritual faith in his lexicon of the forces that
move the world.
Employing a positive babel of tongues -- Asian in among the Russian
and European ones -- Edgar also enjoys a very Stoppardian game about
words and their pronunciation and how (again very Stoppardian)
misinterpretation contributes to the way history comes down to us. When
you also consider that most of the second half is also taken up with
condemnation of ''fortress' Europe through the intervention of a group
of asylum-seekers, you can see the weight of material the play has to
carry.
And maybe that's the trouble: ambition and the very schematic
formality of Pentecost has run away with the play's emotional interior.
You hear the words and witness the grief but are left feeling strangely
aloof from a play of ideas that stubbornly refuses to generate
concomitant passion.

Sustaining the standard of Breakaway would have been difficult anyway
but I think we'd said what we had to say at the time
Rob Adams talks to one half of the famous song-writing partnership,
Gallagher and Lyle, about their continuing musical collaboration, born
in a Largs close-mouth more than 30 years ago
LARGS tenement-dwellers can relax. The Ayrshire town's closes, whose
echo-chamber-like qualities Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle found so
useful for rehearsals, and from which they were routinely chased 30-odd
years ago, won't be pressed into service as the duo prepare for their
performance at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on Sunday, July 2.
The concert, part of Glasgow International Folk Festival, is one in a
series of collector-item gigs Gallagher and Lyle have been playing over
the past five years. Clydebank 1990. Mayfest 1992. And that's about it,
until now. But at one time it looked as if they wouldn't speak to each
other, let alone sing together, again.
When they split up in 1980, it was, says Lyle, ''like a divorce''.
They had been friends since their early teens. ''I was in a band and
no-one in the whole town had a bass guitar, so we convinced Benny to get
one -- and then he was in the band, because he who had the equipment
reigned in those days.''
The boys progressed together through myriad bands, the best-remembered
and most organised being the Tulsans, who had a manager with the
all-important Commer van. Weekends were spent playing at dances in the
Borders, Glasgow, and as far afield as Edinburgh (''that was a long way
in those days'').
The music was all American. ''Rhythm 'n' blues. Rock 'n' roll. We
weren't really interested in British music. We played the American bases
like Dunoon and got to know a lot of the servicemen. In fact, we had
four of them -- they had an a capella group -- come out on gigs with us
and they'd teach us some of the old R'n'B records we'd never heard. It
was great fun.''
There were, though, more serious songwriting ambitions and after
recording a couple of singles which hardly troubled the record warehouse
packers let alone the charts, Gallagher and Lyle decided to give London
a try in 1967. By day they worked in ''proper jobs'' (Lyle as an export
clerk in a steel company) and in their spare time they wrote songs.
Their first break came from the Beatles' Apple publishing company
which paid them ''#25 a week for whatever songs we could muster'', says
Lyle, and the bonus of a cake for their first B-side, a song called
Sparrow, written for Mary Hopkin.
Then, in 1970, they joined forces with former Manfred Mann guitarist
Tom McGuinness and ex-John Mayall's Bluesbreaker, drummer Hughie Flint.
Two top-10 singles -- When I'm Dead and Gone and Malt and Barley Blues,
both Gallagher and Lyle songs -- followed. ''We had a hit album, too.
Everything we did seemed to work, but Benny and I found all the touring
constraining. We really just wanted to be songwriters, so we broke away
and started up again on our own as a duo.''
Gallagher and Lyle quickly built up a substantial following for their
folky songs based on people -- such as the landlady with the motto ''nae
nothing'' -- and situations they had known. Nostalgia for their Scottish
roots surfaced on the album Willie the Lapdog, which celebrated
Clydeside's industries and which included the songbook from the album, a
gesture whose generosity their record company didn't necessarily
appreciate.
Their next act -- touring with a band and a full string section to
promote the album The Last Cowboy -- almost bankrupted them. But it also
spurred them into writing their most successful album, the classic
Breakaway featuring the top-10 hits I Wanna Stay With You and Heart on
My Sleeve.
''Having that financial disaster made us think, the next album has to
be a cracker. We had the audience, we just needed the right album. We
worked particularly hard on it, honed things down until they sounded
great before recording, and because of that we recorded it quickly. So
it still sounded fresh, it didn't sound like we'd spent ages in the
studio,'' explains Lyle.
Breakaway pulled them out of the financial hole but the problems
they'd faced with McGuinness Flint returned, magnified. With an
eight-piece band and the requisite entourage, Gallagher and Lyle became
full-time touring businessmen and their songwriting suffered.
''We continued making albums but it was on the decline. Sustaining the
standard of Breakaway would have been difficult anyway but I think we'd
said what we had to say at the time. Benny and I started drifting apart
as songwriters and as friends, too, which was a shock after all these
years together.''
After the split, Gallagher continued to work in music, touring with
the Fureys, and became involved in television film production. Lyle has
continued as a songwriter, writing What's Love Got To Do With It for
Tina Turner and Just Good Friends, the Michael Jackson-Stevie Wonder
duet on Jackson's Bad album. His most recent success, The Star, which he
co-wrote with Frankie Miller (just before a brain tumour left Miller
paralysed down one side) took Rod Stewart into the Top 20 a few weeks
ago.
After a long lay-off, the Gallagher and Lyle songwriting partnership
has reconvened occasionally, but there are no plans to make their public
appearances more regular. Lyle is currently writing songs for Tina
Turner's next album, due to be recorded in September, and will take a
break from his nine-to-five working routine (''you can't just sit around
waiting for ideas to come to you'') to play in Glasgow.
''It'll be a duo basically but we've asked the Shanty Dykes Ceilidh
Band from Largs to accompany us on a couple of songs and we'll maybe be
looking for help from another couple of friends,'' Lyle says
mysteriously with a line in PR which smacks more of Barnum and Bailey
than Gallagher and Lyle.

Mary Brennan meets choreographer Mark Baldwin, who captures his
dancing ideas on camcorder
WHEN Mark Baldwin arrived at Scottish Ballet he had bags of ideas.
Once the dancers had gathered in the studio, Baldwin opened those bags
and inside lay his up-to-the-minute solution for a choreographer with a
head full of dance but not much money in hand: the camcorder.
With a flourish that would have left Blue Peter people puce with envy,
Baldwin produced a little something he'd prepared earlier -- namely the
ballet he had been commissioned to make for the company's Spring In To
Summer tour. The result can be seen for the first time at Falkirk Town
Hall tomorrow.
Since he cannot afford to rent rehearsal rooms, hire in dancers, or
spend days twizzling about with moves that might not amount to much,
Baldwin has devised a way of making dance that can be done at home. He
sets up his camcorder, and then he dances before its unblinking gaze. He
tries out different combinations of steps -- maybe runs a phrase two or
three times, with different arm gestures -- and then he plays back the
tape.
''I go through it editing and pasting, until I come up with something
that I think works, and that can be transferred to the dancers. That
way, when I do get in the studio, we can use all the time to rehearse.''
He grins. ''That's very important if you don't have huge sums of money
to throw around. You really do learn to make the best use of what's
available -- and I'm it; I'm what's available!''
This hand-to-mouth existence is something that should surely change.
For at a time when so many young choreographers seem determined to
Eurocrash headlong towards an early burn-out, Baldwin is the creative
hope that so many critics have pinned their best notices on. What has
them blowing the dust off their top-of-the-range plaudits?
Well, some go for his acute musicality. Others for the sly wit that
runs through much of his work. But all fix enthusiastically upon the
welcome degree of structural nous that Baldwin displays in his
choreography. Watching a rehearsal of Haydn Pieces -- the work he has
just made for Scottish Ballet -- I find myself agreeing with the Bush
Telegraph that had said: ''Here's one to watch.''
This was Baldwin's first foray into the classical ballet zone. He had,
as a tiddler in his native New Zealand, taken steps in ballet. He had
even cut school to dart over the road for illicit classes. But
subsequently he changed vocabularies and countries, ending up as a
member of the Rambert Dance Company where he moved in the style of
Tetley, Cunningham, Bruce, and Alston. In fact, this diversity has
simply enhanced his appreciation of the body and what it can do.
Haydn Pieces could, I feel, be subtitled Escapades Of A Summer Night.
The mood is set by the music -- Baldwin has a declared passion for piano
music and here he uses three short Haydn pieces that scamper and twirl
around the keyboard at a merry lick. The dancers -- five women, four men
-- arrive in groups, but don't necessarily stay in them. There is a
flirtatious, yet intense, toing and froing that sees ego deflated,
expectations dashed and some parties reconciled. Even without costumes
and set -- this was, after all, the first full run through -- the piece
looked good.
Baldwin is that very rare thing: a choreographer with something to say
who waited until he knew how to say it effectively. In conversation, he
reveals a wealth of informed interest in modern art, literature, and
technology. All of which feed into the way he conceives and shapes his
dance. Over and above his astute use of video, he has worked with
Life-Forms, the software that Merce Cunningham uses to explore
variations on movement, and he plans, soon, to figure on the Internet by
programming some of his dance into the system.
Fear not, however, if you are not equipped to download a Baldwin
ballet on to a screen near you -- apart from his Scottish Ballet
collection, he has a piece in Rambert's second programme at the
Edinburgh Festival Theatre at the end of June and you can access his own
company on the Fringe during week three at the St Bride's Centre.
* Scottish Ballet presents its double bill of Darrell's Cheri and Mark
Baldwin's Haydn Pieces at Falkirk Town Hall, tomorrow and Thursday. The
programme then tours to Kirkcaldy, Perth, and Dundee.

THE beauty of Miranda Tufnell's work is, at least, twofold. The piece
itself -- a close-knit alliance of movement, sound and art installation
-- is a hauntingly lovely experience at the time. Its after-effects --
as witnessed by the dozens who stayed on for the post-performance
discussion -- are similarly uplifting. Many people who spoke obviously
felt brushed by something profound, poetic, and vital.
Invisible Forces of Silver begins in silence. There's time to gaze at
Caroline Lee's vast sculpture and mull over what images it evokes. Long,
pale fingers of stripped willow, fronding down from on high, in a dense
canopy. A hanging fall of copper mesh, a scatter of white feathers
caught near the top. A glass bowl brimming with water. It's as if a
sacred grove had burst through the floor of the Traverse.
The opening sounds are high, thin scrapings. A spray of odd, edgy
notes that sound ancient and alien. Tufnell herself emerges, a white
figure almost obliterated by a huge stook of withies that gradually --
and this happens very slowly -- clatter from her grasp.
Thereafter the piece journeys round the space, sometimes in spasms of
intense writhing, sometimes in superbly controlled phases of slow
stretchings. Always there is the sense of Tufnell looking for a form of
reconciliation. Setting and shifting the various atmospheres throughout
is Sylvia Hallet's richly textured sound-score with its compelling mix
of ethereal chantings, visceral howlings and strange, swooping strings.
In all, a very special event. Anyone interested in finding out more
about Tufnell's way of moving should know she is taking classes and
workshops this week at Dance Base at the Assembly Rooms.

FOR a company capitalised at #733m, the rate of capital expenditure at
distribution and specialist hire Christian Salvesen during the last six
years at #485m is quite remarkable.
It also represents 16% of cumulative sales for the period and a ratio
that one would applaud in the pharmaceuticals sector as being
appropriate for a dynamic organisation.
However, Salvesen shareholders have not seen a commensurate increase
in earnings with a gain of just 28% over the period to March.
But there are good grounds for believing that dependable, long-term
growth has been built into the Edinburgh-based company as it expands
market share and geographic exposure.
Last year was the final one of selling off peripheral businesses and
as a result, stated pre-tax profits jumped #30m to #104m. The on-going
businesses improved by 3% to #78.8m on a 19% increase in turnover to
#603m.
The best performance came in distribution in Continental Europe
including the UK for frozen and chilled foods as well as grocery
products with Salvesen able to offer customers a trans-European service
which is invaluable when clients include Unilever. The contract to
manage the largest dedicated distribution centre in Europe, owned by
Safeway at Bellshill, Lanarkshire, has been renewed for another five
years while additional volume is coming from both Sainsbury and Kwik
Save.
Last week, an agreement was signed to design and handle distribution
for the House of Fraser and chief executive Chris Masters expects more
contracts to come in this area although not of quite the same size.
With Hays the only serious rival because of turmoil at NFC and poor
performance by other competitors, Salvesen is in a very good position.
The only snag is the slowness of the US food manufacturers to use
centralised distribution which is now par for the course in Britain.
Profits from that side of the business dropped 15% although they are
recovering in the current year.
Continental European distribution has already seen #37m of new
business this financial year.
The Aggreko electricity generator and temperature control activities
had a mixed experience. The US operations were outstanding as a result
of the World Cup and the Goodwill Games while the core industrial side
benefited from good demand and better margins. But Germany went into
reverse as did Singapore. However, the Atlanta Olympic Games next year
should prove beneficial to Salvesen. The Aggreko operations in Dumbarton
export about 500 generators a year, some with a value of up to #100,000.
The Food services sector, which includes frozen vegetable processing,
was hit by a poor pea harvest which resulted in a sharp drop in demand
for storage and profits fell by nearly a fifth to #8.1m. The outlook
this time round is much better with a national shortage of frozen
vegetables encouraging farmers to plant more this year. This is
providing more work for cold-storage depots.
Now shorn of its brick business, Light &amp; Sound Design, and the Vicoma
oil boom subsidiary, Salvesen is currently about 28% geared.
Acquisitions of any size seem unlikely for the immediate future.
Profits this year of about #85m should start to meet the objective of
10% earnings growths and leave the shares at 253p trading at a p/e of 12
which does seem a little cheap. The dividend total has been raised 3.7%
to 8.4p with a 5p final for a 4.1% yield.

Mark Fisher reviews four plays seen over three days at the theatre in
the hills, and finds the experience a bit of a curate's egg -- good in
parts
THERE'S a part of me that wonders whether Pitlochry Festival Theatre
doesn't deserve its own special style of reviewing. I'm half inclined to
argue that productions that would be roundly slated anywhere else are
almost acceptable at the theatre in the hills.
I think it's because it's that much harder to work up the same head of
steam about shows that would send bad-tempered critics grumbling out of
the Royal Lyceum or Perth Theatre or Dundee Rep' when they're being
performed in the idyllic surrounds of Pitlochry to an unpretentious
audience of appreciative holidaymakers.
But it's more than simply the heady blast of Highland air that leads
me to propose such a critical leniency. No, it's something to do with
the theatre's whole artistic approach. It is catering for its audiences
in a way that is positive not cynical, committed not exploitative,
enthusiastic not lack-lustre.
There are those of us who may cringe, for example, when the curtain
goes up and on cue the audience applauds the design, but there's no
denying the sets on this big, open stage are invariably as confident,
elaborate and extravagant as this audience could desire. No
short-changing here. That they also reflect the values of bourgeois
realism and rule out many of the possibilities of true theatrical
creativity hardly seems relevant.
Last week I stayed three days and saw four plays out of the five
currently in the repertoire: Alan Ayckbourn's A Chorus of Disapproval,
Bob Larbey's Building Blocks, Brandon Thomas's Charley's Aunt and
Terence Rattigan's Cause Celebre. I missed the well-received and rapidly
selling-out production of Tony Roper's The Steamie, first seen here last
year, and there are two more productions still to join the repertoire
before the summer's through.
If anything links these productions, apart from the splendid
opportunity of seeing the same actors tackle different roles on a
nightly basis, it is the warm-hearted exuberance of the performances.
The architecture of the theatre encourages a very direct kind of
relationship between actor and spectator and it's one the actors seem to
revel in.
If all this sounds like a prelude to a critical mauling, I don't
entirely mean it to. I will, however, start at the very bottom with
Building Blocks, a play about a middle-class couple who want an
extension built on their house and about the builders who'd rather be
working elsewhere. And that, sadly, is all it's about.
I really don't want to use writer Bob Larbey's previous
accomplishments against him -- he was behind The Good Life, Brush
Strokes and The Darling Buds of May -- but you'd have thought that the
whole point of him writing a stage play would be to break out of the
familiar TV sitcom format and try something different. In Building
Blocks he has tried something longer, which is not at all the same
thing.
Joan Knight's production scores most laughs from the old gag of
Builder A putting lots of sugar in Builder B's mug of tea, then Builder
B adding a couple of teaspoons more. Coupled with the occasional
pratfall, these are last-ditch diversions to hide the fact that the play
lacks even the basic comic tension that the situation would suggest.
From sitcom to classic comedy and Clive Perry's production of
Charley's Aunt which tries rather too hard for its own good. This
turn-of-the-century cross-dressing farce should work in quite a simple
way through the comedy of mistaken identity. Perry's manic and
tightly-disciplined stream of accompanying physical business is
extraneous and rarely funny in itself. Meanwhile Ian Grieve as the
impostor aunt veers too much towards clod-hopping and not enough towards
femininity to hit quite the right note of comic tension. The result is a
production that dazzles more than it tickles.
Perry is altogether more successful with Ayckbourn's A Chorus of
Disapproval, a typically clever comedy about the backstage manoeuvrings
running up to an amateur production of The Beggar's Opera. The Pitlochry
company, represented in a big 15-strong cast, is shown to its best
advantage here, the older members in particular turning in some cracking
cameo-performances. Guy Nicholls can do no wrong now I've seen him as
the boorish Jarvis Huntley-Pike and there are excellent turns also from
Becky Baxter, Steven Wren and Janet Michael, not to mention Jeff
Shankley and Martyn James in the leads.
Finally to Cause Celebre directed by Joan Knight. Though Rattigan's
last play, written in 1977, it seems every inch the kind of well-made
drama with which he made his name in the thirties and forties. Based on
the real-life Rattenbury trial of the 1930s in which a woman and her
young lover were accused of murdering her elderly husband, the play is
eventually pulled from its promising beginnings towards a more
predictable, and over-long, court-room drama.
But like all the work in Pitlochry it takes the audience seriously,
doesn't patronise and does what it has to do in an open, inclusive way.
Not brilliant perhaps but it still beats the karaoke evening back at the
hotel.

THAT contemptible concept, the trickle-down effect, drip-drips through
both Hauptman's powerful play, The Weavers, and the production, staged
with vigour by the final-year students at the RSAMD. Why should the poor
wait for the natural wastage of the rich? At one point a wife screams at
her grand-father-in-law: ''They just shite on you and you smile and say
you deserved it.'' Words Hauptman never wrote. They belong to translator
Bill Findlay but Hauptman would have approved, as he would his
revolutionary blacksmith reforged like a stirring Tommy Sheridan.
Every element of the play tucks the impoverished weavers' struggle
against the exploitative cloth factory owners, into a lost pocket in
time. The setting is 19th century Germany, the dialect is dated Scots,
but the feelings, the emotions, the facts, events, and struggles are
today, here, now. At times the speeches have the power to lift you to
your feet in righteous outrage. A good thing, for the packed cast leave
little room for dramatic visuals. Director Alan Sharpe allows the play
to unfold simply like a red flag, the one his cast pick up and wave.
On stage drapes of Conservative blue are replaced by revolutionary
red, the same bloom as Labour's rose but thornier and bloodier. Red does
stain the shirt of the grandfather-in-law who, after praying for the
souls of those who choose to revolt, continues his work, but is struck
by a stray bullet. There can be no spectators in an ''us'' versus
''them'' battle. From the opening strains by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra
to which the cast worked in time, to their bloody climax, the audience
was an extra burden, but they carried us all along and we were
converted.

WITH the Mousetrap in its fifth decade, the King's decision to
kick-off their six-week long summer season of thrillers with Agatha
Christie's Black Coffee was a safe one. Performed by the Colin McIntyre
Repertory Company who have been regular visitors to the King's over the
past eight years, Black Coffee is Agatha Christie on familiar territory.
Set in the library of Sir Claud Amory's country mansion somewhere in
the Home Counties, events are presided over by the dapper Belgian sleuth
Hercule Poirot. We are introduced to the usual array of unlikely
monikered characters including an Italian doctor called Carelli, a
butler named Tredwell, and Poirot's nice but dim sidekick Captain
Hastings OBE.
The plot is quite simply this: when Sir Claud discovers that his
valuable scientific formula has been stolen he orders the lights to be
turned out to give the thief a chance to replace it. From this
less-than-original theatrical device a story of murder, double bluff,
and investigation unfolds.
As one would expect from an Agatha Christie murder mystery, the
characters are scarcely more than two-dimensional caricatures, but at
times the action is so poorly paced that it almost grinds to a halt.
The actors did their best with a rather stilted script and the comic
pairing of Sophie Turner as a sassy flapper girl with Andrew Ryan as the
bumbling, besotted Hastings delighted the audience.
Black Coffee was well received by the opening-night audience and the
Colin McIntyre company will no doubt play to a busy King's Theatre in
the weeks ahead.

Dance
THIS is more or less the start of Scottish Ballet setting out on their
summer manoeuvres! Throughout June the company divides into three units,
each with a busy schedule of smaller-scale venues and an appropriate
programme of short works. It's not only a good way of keeping in touch
with audiences across Scotland, it's a useful opportunity for different
members of the company to take on new solo roles and for younger
recruits to acquaint themselves with works from Scottish Ballet's
considerable small-scale repertoire.
This particular programme opened with a fine performance of Les
Sylphides, ended in a merry riot of nimble feet (Shoals of Herring) and
in between offered glimpses of such contrasting styles of Bournonville
and contemporary dance -- very much a ''something for everyone'' bill,
but done without condescension, and brightly danced throughout.
The only piece I haven't seen before was an intriguing solo,
choreographed by Christian Uboldi and based on the famous Nijinsky role
in L'Apres Midi d'un Faune. It's a sly little essay in langour and
narcissism, ripe with a sense of youthful, self-aware energy, all of
which was handsomely conveyed by a lithely agile Kevin Horn.
Les Sylphides opened the evening with an image of ballet that everyone
expects. Ethereal, romantic, drifting ballet blanc -- presented with
pleasing lightness by the dancers, especially Elspeth Shaw who seemed to
float and waft as if made of the traditional thistle-down. She also
shone, later, in Shoals of Herring, kicking up her heels in passionate
duet with Preston Clare -- he had already acted the love sick Pierrot in
The Fairy Doll. This trio, from the Kirov repertoire is a piece of
flirty whimsy: Christina Tozer led her smitten suitors a mischievously
wicked dance, but Clare and Andrew Ross had a few comic turns up their
voluminous sleeves, enough any way to send the younger members of the
audience into gales of delighted giggles. This, surely is a
user-friendly face of a classical art form: making and audience chuckle
and clap when the company comes to their own doorstep.

EDINBURGH-based oil and gas independent Cairn Energy yesterday reached
another milestone on the road to becoming a force in power generation in
Bangladesh.
Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell, in the country's capital Dhaka,
signed a production-sharing contract for Bangladeshi Block 15.
Block 15, which is primarily onshore, is about the size of 28 UK North
Sea blocks.
It includes the Semutang gas field, discovered in 1970, to which
Bangladeshi state oil and gas company PetroBangla has attributed proved
and probable reserves of 230 billion cubic feet.
Cairn and its partner in a proposed $100m (#63m) power generation
project at Semutang, Midlands Electricity subsidiary Midland Power
International, have significantly raised their sights in recent weeks.
Initially, they had been contemplating the construction of a
40-megawatt power station.
However, although the project is dependent on Cairn and Midland
agreeing a price for the electricity with the Bangladeshi government,
the pair are now looking at the development of a 100MW plant.
Midland, which has been looking at potential sites for the proposed
power station, is in talks with the Bangladeshi Power Development Board.
Cairn hopes to shoot seismic and drill a well in the first quarter of
next year.
The construction of the proposed power plant, in which Cairn has the
option to take a 30% stake, could start in the second quarter of next
year. Midland, with a 30% stake in the development of the Semutang gas
field, is sharing the upstream and downstream risks with Cairn.
If the power generation project comes to fruition, it will generate a
cash flow for Cairn.
However, Cairn, which last May became the first Western company to
sign a production-sharing contract in Bangladesh, relating to the
adjoining Block 16, hopes the indication that the country's major gas
reserves can be turned into cash through electricity generation will
boost its share price.
The other signatories to the latest production-sharing contract were
the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, PetroBangla, and
Holland Sea Search Bangladesh, a subsidiary of Holland Sea Search
Holding (HSSH).
Cairn, with a 60% interest in Block 15, owns a majority stake in HSSH,
which has a 40% interest.
Shares in Cairn were unchanged at 95p.

THE board of Wallets' Marts, Castle Douglas, has repeated its advice
to shareholders to reject the #12 a share offer from James Craig Ltd,
the Ayr-based auctioneers.
Craig's has announced an extension of its offer until June 20 after
confirming that it had received acceptances from Wallets shareholders in
respect of 22.3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company.
It has been suggested that shareholders who are keen to retain an
interest in the Castle Douglas mart could do so by selling part of their
shareholding to Craigs and retaining the balance.
Last night a Craig's spokesman said that they had a fair amount of
interest in the idea of a partial sale.
Mr Tom Gillespie, chairman of Wallets, said that the shareholders had
indicated their desire for the company to remain independent. He warned
that under the terms and conditions of the Craig offer those who
accepted in respect of a proportion of their shares would not receive
any money from Craig unless it got more than 50% of Wallets.
''If Craig were to acquire more than 50% of Wallets, shareholders
would lose the right to appoint the board. Once this power was lost they
would totally lose control of the future of Wallets business and all its
assets,'' he said.

KITCHENS and joinery group Berisford International gives itself a pat
on the back for its half-year performance package to March 31, 1995, but
the market was unimpressed.
The company, which in February had suffered the rebuff of only a 54%
take up of its #317m rights issue of convertible stock, yesterday saw
the shares tumble 32p to 226p. The rights flop in particular is likely
to continue to overshadow Berisford shares for some little time yet.
Guided by chief executive Alan Bowkett who bought into the company
just over two years ago, Berisford's rehabilitation from the once bombed
out commodities and property business is in fact proceeding according to
plan.
It is back in the black, showing a profit of #11.1m for the six months
period against a loss of #5.8m last time, including a #9.1m exceptional
charge. And shareholders are to receive a 1p dividend payout on diluted
earnings per share of 6.3p. They were paid nothing for the comparable
time last year.
The results include a contribution of #6.2m, up 26.1%, from Welbilt,
the US kitchen equipment producer whose acquisition for #295m was
completed toward the end of January. Welbilt's performance to date has
exceeded Berisford's ''demanding'' expectations boosted by buoyant
markets and from success with its market segmentation strategy,
particularly with fast food chains.
At home, operating profits of the Magnet kitchen business grew from
#1.4m to #6.5m, benefiting from cost cutting and higher volumes. The
improvement here came against a background of continuing tough trading
conditions in the UK.
In particular, the company said the housing and jobber-builder markets
remain depressed and unsurprisingly given the competitive situation,
Berisford cannot readily pass on the full impact of raw material price
increases.
Disposals of the old Berisford operations have brought in #24.6m --
mainly from the sale of Ketlon and Euro Trailer Rental -- to add to the
group's cash kitty which stood at #85m at the end of March.
Group strategy for Welbilt for the future include international
expansion especially in South America, the Far East and Europe, new
product development, unit cost reduction, and rationalisation of product
ranges and manufacturing facilities as well as suitable acquisitions.
On prospects, Berisford chairman John Sclater said the first half has
seen considerable progress in the implementation of group strategy to
build a broadly based industrial holding company. He said: ''We have
diversified both our manufacturing and geographical base and have strong
foundations for growth.''
On the downside, market conditions in the UK remain difficult and,
indeed, since the half-year, the joinery market has declined and no
improvement is expected in the second half.
A certain amount of market caution is also to be expected at this
stage of the game plan.

<HEADLINE>MDC wants to give farmers a return for their money</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN important aim of the new Milk Development Council will be to pay
dairy a farmers a return for their levy of .04p a litre, Mr Peter
Merson, the council's first chief executive said yesterday.
Mr Merson envisaged the return to farmers coming through the benefits
of research into a range of subjects of direct interest to the average
dairy farmer. These included the economic feeding of cattle, major areas
of productivity loss, and genetic tools which could reduce disease and
increase productivity.
The MDC expects to be devoting several million pounds to funding
research and development projects and they are hoping to be able to
double their own #5m budget by attracting additional funds from Europe
or commercial sponsors.
Speaking at the rural centre at Ingliston, near Edinburgh, Mr Merson
said he wanted to attract ''serious'' European money to British research
institutes. If projects did not offer benefits in terms of welfare on
the farm, consumer choice or the environment the probability was that
the council should not be funding that work, he said. ''It has to relate
to what is happening on the average dairy farm.
On research priorities he highlighted reproductive inefficiency,
lameness and mastitis. ''Any farm which has cracked it on all three will
be an efficient farm,'' he said. He pointed out that current research
supported by MAFF or the Scottish Office included four projects on
mastitis and 58 on control of environmental waste from farms. That
showed where government priorities were going, -- and yet mastitis
problems were an area of great importance to most dairy farmers.
The MDC expects to have a levy income of #5m, of which about #500,000
will come from Scotland.

CARTON manufacturer Field Group, Britain's biggest, had to endure
sharp increases in raw material prices in its last financial year to
April 2, 1995 and expects more of the same in the current year.
Even so, chief executive Keith Gilchrist and his team are anything but
disheartened and have produced a gutsy performance for the year, lifting
profits 12.5% to #15.4m before tax on turnover 8.6% higher at #168m.
After adjusting for acquisitions and allowing for the effect of exchange
rate movements on the results of the Belgian subsidiary, turnover grew
by 5.3% and operating profits by 9.3%.
A final dividend of 5.2p raises the total 9.2% from 7.05p to 7.7p on
earnings per share up 12.8% to 20.2p, benefiting from a slightly lower
effective tax rate than last year. The shares firmed 4p to 294p, which
compares with a flotation price of 250p when the company went public in
July 1993.
Field, one of whose six UK manufacturing locations is in East
Kilbride, benefited from a good export performance. And it managed to
improve operating profit margins from 9.1% to 9.3% despite the difficult
environment.
The scale of the price pressures can be gauged from the fact that
while the UK folding carton market grew in value by just 2% in 1994 over
1993, in the nine months to April 1995, board prices rose by some 30%
with more to come.
The company has handled this well and its efforts to avoid or recover
these increases have been largely successful, but it does mean constant
and intense pressure on margins and productivity.
Passing the costs on to international customers proved easier than in
the UK where the supermarket groups proved more obdurate. Here margins
were held in some cases by reducing the thickness of the board.
Field, whose activities are focused on three chosen sectors --
International and branded products, food and household, and
pharmaceutical and healthcare -- has seen considerable advancement in
its packaging for overseas, particularly continental Europe where it is
also concentrating on expanding through acquisition.
The strength of its export packaging side can be seen from its
customers. In the drinks sector, for example, sales were up 17% during
the year. The company has won sole supply contracts with United
Distillers and with William Grant. Sales in tobacco sector were also up
17%, supported by developing business among existing customers. In
confectionery Field is a key supplier to the majority of the UK's
leading companies, and is extending its services to mainland European
customers.
Capital expenditure in fixed assets amounted to #14.1m during the year
and is due to rise to more than #20m this year on new machinery and
factories. A new factory is scheduled for completion in July which will
boost supplies of packaging for Boots.

THE trouble with millennia is that they seduce us all into confronting
what the future might hold with a passion massively more intense than we
devote to more minor exclamation marks on the calendar of time.
Each successive Hogmanay. That fiftieth birthday you'd rather hadn't
arrived quite so quickly. Even the passage of one century into the next,
no doubt. All are triggers for a personal or collective focus on
retracing what's gone before and contemplating what the future might
have in store.
But staring through the millennial time barrier, wondering what a
fresh thousand-year span might mean for humanity and this fragile planet
we all inhabit is of an all together more awesome order. It's like
peeking over a sheer cliff edge with no discernible bottom. The thrill
of anticipation is delicious. The unknowns, stretching mist-shrouded
below, are tantalisingly hidden from us.
The approaching millennium is already triggering introspection and
crystal-ball gazing on a scale which presages a cultural epidemic. Will
there be an organisation or interest group left in the land which, by
Hogmany 1999, will not have reviewed its present raison d'etre and
hammered out a new vision? In my own, somewhat eclectic, conference and
seminar circuit, Beyond 2000 and 20-20 Vision themes are proliferating
faster than rabbits on speed.
My problem with all this heightened preoccupation with the future is a
rather curmudgeonly attachment to the inconvenient fact that the future
is, by definition, not ours to know. Indeed, as a report in yesterday's
Financial Times made clear, a lot of us have considerable difficulty
knowing much about the here and now, let alone getting a handle on
what's yet to come.
British Telecom, worried that the business community has grave
misconceptions about the current cost of a telephone call, commissioned
NOP to survey Britain's senior managers about the cost of other
everyday, but key, business services.
Three-quarters of the 600-strong sample of directors, owners, and
managers questioned gave wildly wrong answers when asked what current
bank base rate is. Guesses ranged from 0.4% to 25%! It's 6.75%, in case
you are beginning to sweat. Nearly a third of the sample had no accurate
idea of the hourly cost of hiring a temporary secretary, guesses ranging
from #2.50 to #50.
Nearly half those questioned could not guess at the daily cost of
hiring an accountant. Only 8% knew the typical price tag on a laptop
computer with a 486 chip. Little wonder, then, that, on average, they
thought the price of a daytime long-distance phone call lasting three
minutes was four times the actual tariff.
What prices did the sample get right? Well, nine out of 10 knew the
price of a pint of lager. And half knew the cover price of a copy of the
Sun newspaper.
We should perhaps draw a discreet veil over the reading and drinking
preferences of our business elite. There is even a relatively simple
explanation for the widespread executive ignorance exposed by the NOP
findings. Even company directors still occasionally buy their newspapers
and their beer by digging into their own pockets. But restocking the
photocopier with paper or hiring a temp is usually someone else's
responsibility. That said, how the respondents who thought base rates
are 25% and a temp costs #50 an hour are still in business does puzzle
me.
If some of us have such a tenuous grip on the present, how can we hope
to second-guess the future? We can't, of course. But that doesn't stop
whole armies of forecasters having a go. Typically their tactic is to
take that present and extrapolate it forward or to dissect past trends
and chart them, like one of those old-fashioned paper Christmas
decorations, into the future. I treat all such exercises with thick
rubber gloves. In my experience the future, as often as not, bites back
with countless twists and surprises none of us expected.
In the eighties we were all encouraged to believe that investing in
bricks and mortar was a surefire way to make our fortunes. House prices
were on a one-way rising escalator. Better get on before it was too
late. The endowment policies we were encouraged to take out to back our
mortgages projected returns over 25-year terms which have been revised
downwards ever since.
Now, in the more sober nineties, we are being told that the housing
bubble has burst for good. The recent Panorama programme which so
infuriated the housebuilding sector was pinned on the assumption that
falling house prices, negative equity, and endowments which may not
cover outstanding mortgages when they mature are the new reality now and
for decades ahead.
That assumption of semi-permanent housing gloom is no more likely to
be valid 10 years from now than the euphoria of the eighties has turned
out to be in the nineties.
Our economy has endured a long, painful process of reconstruction
which, thanks to our declining international competitiveness and the
leverage technology brings, has created a serious mismatch between
available work and the numbers seeking jobs. Downsizing and
casualisation of the labour market have, at every level, generated such
anxiety that, in yesterday's opinion survey for Barnado's, more than
eight out of 10 respondents now think today's children are less likely
to find permanent work than their parents were.
They may be right. Tomorrow's world of work may be predominately
ad-hoc, freelance, casual -- a fluid network of temporary alliances
mediated through virtual companies where no-one qualifies for a gold
watch. But, there again, business may re-engineer itself so often that
it gets back to a belief in permanence and stability and jobs which last
for more than a six-month contract.
We simply don't know which model or fashion will prevail. We need,
therefore, to become less preoccupied with predicting the future and
more concerned with developing the capabilities to turn to our advantage
whatever challenges the future throws at us when it finally arrives.

PORTSMOUTH &amp; Sunderland Newspapers is vigorously seeking alternative
work for its presses after the loss of two national newspaper contracts.
Last October, the order to print northern editions of the Daily Mail
and Mail on Sunday at Sunderland expired and more recently The
Independent said it was ending its contract to print at Portsmouth
prematurely from July 1.
Contract printing revenue was down 11% to #13m in the year to April 1
compared with the previous 12 months after the loss of the Mail, but
overall pre-tax profits were up 29%.
The group made #8.3m after rationalisation costs of #1.1m, up from
#7.3m in the previous year when rationalisation cost #1.7m.
''Despite difficult trading conditions for its publishing and printing
business, P&amp;SN remains confident about the longer-term future of both
these businesses and also its third business, retailing,'' said chairman
Sir Richard Storey.
''The significant investment in new presses and shops will, in due
course, produce substantial rewards.''
The group publishes four evening papers and some 20 weekly titles.
Advertising revenue was up 5% to #37.4m and newspaper sales revenue grew
by 3% to #12.3m.
All the paid-for weeklies had increased or maintained circulation,
said the group. ''The four evening newspapers, in common with other
evening newspapers across the country, found conditions more difficult.
''Even so, they performed reasonably well by industry standards -- The
News, Portsmouth, and Hartlepool Mail were within 1% of the previous
year, the Shields Gazette was down 1.5% and the Sunderland Echo was down
3%.''
Revenue at the One Stop convenience stores rose 18% to #55.8m as the
chain grew by 17 to 100. The company has decided to accelerate the
expansion of the business, opening 20 each year for the foreseeable
future.
Earnings per share last year after rationalisation costs increased to
42.8p from 41p and the dividend total is up to 11.7p from 10.6p.

<HEADLINE>Core factory gate price inflation is still rising</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977911994</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THERE were no nasty shocks in May's producer price figures, but the
underlying picture is that core factory gate price inflation is still
rising.
The year-on-year rate for the series which excludes the food, drink,
tobacco, and petroleum industries moved up to a four-year high with
further price increases in the pipeline.
Factory gate prices as a whole rose by just 0.2% in May, the smallest
increase since last September. But the April figures were revised up to
show a jump of 0.6% compared with the previous 0.4%. In paper,
publishing, and printing prices rose by 0.9% between the two months.
The year-on-year rate was unchanged at 4.2%, though the April rate had
been previously stated at 4.0%.
The core series rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, taking the
year-on-year rate up from a revised 4.2% (4.1%) to 4.5%.
In the seasonally adjusted index the rise in the latest three months
over the previous three was the equivalent of an annual rate of 5.1%.
Input prices for manufacturers' materials and fuel costs gained just
0.2% seasonally adjusted on the month, but the April increase was
revised up from 0.7% to 0.8%. The moderate rise in May was surprising
given the weakness of sterling.
The annual rate of increase in input prices, which have been fuelled
by the recovery-led boom in commodity prices, fell back from 11.5% to
10%.
Input price inflation seems to have peaked at 12.1% in January, and
the three and six-month annualised rates were 6.6% and 8.6% respectively
in May.
However, the sharp increases in input prices have been largely offset
by falling labour costs. This is no longer the case. The best of the
productivity gains are behind us and pay settlements are starting to
pick up again.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''Taking developments in input prices
and labour costs together, manufacturers' margins have been squeezed in
recent months.
''With capacity utilisation running at close to its late eighties'
cyclical high, there is no reason to expect this to continue. There is
considerable scope, therefore, for bad news on factory gate inflation
over the coming months.''
Moreover the effect of the significant fall in the exchange rate this
year is yet to work its way through to activity in the manufacturing
sector. When it does it can only add to inflationary pressures.
But for the time being no alarm bells are ringing. So interest rates
are likely to remain on hold this summer.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE shares slipped to 34-month low yesterday as investor gloom
tightened its hold on the market, and some analysts say the key market
average may still have a very long way to fall.
Stocks have been locked in a downward spiral for a host of reasons,
from the strong yen to the US-Japan car dispute and fears over the state
of the Japanese financial industry, which is creaking under a mountain
of bad debt.
Some market participants said only concrete action by the Japanese
authorities to ease the fears of a banking collapse could snap the
market out of its black mood and stave off an even bigger drop in stock
prices.
The Nikkei average lost 230.72 points, or 1.53%, to close at
14,813.46, its lowest finish in two years and 10 months. Most brokers
now expect the Nikkei to dip to its August 19, 1992 close of 14,309.41
in the short term.
''We are finding it extremely difficult to be positive on the
market,'' said Neil Rogers, a strategist at UBS Securities. ''There is
no quick way out and we are by no means at such low levels that we can't
go any lower.''
Traders were also anticipating falls. ''I wouldn't be astonished to
see it go to 14,300 by the end of this week,'' said a trader at a big
European brokerage in Tokyo.
''In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at 10,000 on the
Nikkei by the end of this month,'' said a British trader.
UBS strategist Rogers said that it was crucial the government acted to
lift the cloud because of the damage the stock market slump was doing to
corporate earnings and, by extension, to the whole of the Japanese
economy.
Rogers said the slump had triggered a self-defeating cycle. It first
prompted many investors to switch into low-risk domestic bonds, pushing
down share prices and unrealised gains on companies' equity portfolios,
he said.
To bolster battered balance sheets, companies moved to repatriate
overseas earnings which pushed the yen up further.
The yen's climb was also being pushed by the deadlock in Japan-US car
trade talks, which threatens to hit corporate earnings by slashing the
value of overseas sales.

BARRI Grub is also one of the few successes in the wake of the report
on the Scottish Diet, by Professor Philip James and colleagues two years
ago, which identified the appalling eating habits of Scottish
schoolchildren.
The report underlined the importance of good nutrition to avoid
increased risk of premature death from cancer or heart disease in later
life.
It exposed the conceit we have all developed about our supposed
healthy eating. We think we are giving children more healthy food, when
the opposite is happening.
Although poor nutrition has always been linked to deprivation, the
poverty of the Scottish diet extends to better-off areas as well as
housing schemes. In many cases, juvenile malnutrition is worse in
middle-class homes because of dietary ignorance among parents who spend
more on food and believe they know better.
There is a generational gulf in how people regard their diet. Fruit
and fresh vegetables were prized by our grandparents, who grew up in
post-war austerity. Curiously, it was the Second World War and its
enforced rationing which also witnessed the biggest improvements in
Scotland's health, as measured in indicators like maternal and infant
mortality rates.
However, the diet of British schoolchildren has deteriorated markedly
in the last decade. Sweets are now the second biggest contributor to
daily energy intakes of 11 and 12-year-olds, followed closely by chips,
thus resurrecting the fictional Fat Boab into classroom reality.
The nutritional record of Scottish children is poorer than those in
the rest of the UK and for tooth decay is worse still.
The James report recommended doubling of both fruit and vegetable
intake, and all children above the age of two to drink semi-skimmed
rather than whole milk, a proposal ignored by the Government in setting
specific targets.
''The typical Scottish child is disadvantaged from birth by not being
breast-fed, receives solid food in the inappropriate form of cereal
foods too early in life, is weaned on to the unhealthy diet and
establishes a dietary pattern which is too high in fat, in refined
extrinsic sugars and in sodium,'' it said.
''The usual Scottish diet consumed by children is also that which we
would now expect to be conducive to the development of adult chronic
diseases. Data from other countries allows us to predict confidently
that the blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels of Scotland's
children are likely to be tracking along some of the highest values
found internationally.''
Two years later and Professor James, director of the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, sees little grounds for optimism.
''What the Barri Grub project is doing is great but we need to do
something on a national basis,'' he told The Herald.
''We have a slightly crazy approach in Scotland. We are so obsessed
with freedom of choice that we have forgotten about educating and
informing children about what they should eat. It is a major task,
because we do not realise there is a huge problem.
''I think we have to take a totally different approach to change the
attitudes of parents and teachers in schools.''
In fairness, it takes time to change ingrained attitudes but progress
is being made. For example, Strathclyde's Catering Direct has launched a
major initiative in primary schools. Called Keeping Your Balance, it
aims to convince both pupils and their parents that healthy eating can
also be enjoyable eating.

NINETEEN ninety five has proved a plethora of anniversaries; and the
weekend has seen attention fall on yet another one, the two-hundredth
anniversary of the 45. Two hundred years ago this summer, Charles Edward
Stuart landed at Loch nan Uamh, a wild and beautiful sealoch on the
Arisaig coast, to launch his doomed bid to reclaim his grandfather's
throne. This week has seen the start of a re-enactment by the romantics
of the White Cockade Society. They have begun a march from Glenfinnan to
Edinburgh; they hope to attract some 5000 walkers, and raise #250,000
for charity.
Why does the last Jacobite Rising still fascinate us? Even by 1745,
the Jacobite cause was an anachronism. By the end of the eighteenth
century, the French and the Americans would be forging the recognisable
institutions and rhetoric of modern politics.
It was, even in the summer of 1745, a reckless cause. Most Highland
chiefs declined to become involved. Most Scots received the Young
Pretender with hostility or indifference. More, in fact, would fight for
the Hanovarian status quo than for the half-Polish, half-Italian prince.
With the collapse of the enterprise in April 1746, Scotland suffered
great hardships, and in the glens of the west Government forces
committed atrocities that fell, in many districts, only a little short
of genocide.
The Stuarts, if glamorous, had proved truly hopeless monarchs. It is
hard to like any of these kings and queens if one studies their acts and
attitudes. Charles II was probably the most wicked man ever to hold the
throne. His brother James VII was an ill-tempered, sulky, debauched
melancholic, who threw the three kingdoms away; he made not the
slightest effort to defend his position when William of Orange landed in
1688.
Both men authorised -- indeed, as Duke of York, James VII had
personally presided over -- the brutal torture and summary executions of
the Covenanting era. Most sensible Scots were heartily glad to see the
back of the line. So why, today, do we honour their grandson as a
Scottish hero, and -- in our cups -- lament the retreat from Derby, the
Culloden catastrophe, the collapse with the 45 of much, like the
Highland clan system, that was never to be rebuilt?
There is this to it: what we do not know. What would have happened if
Charles Edward had carried his Army beyond Derby? Would we have won
London, and the throne of the Union? And if so, what kind of world would
we know today? My personal view -- shared by most of the new Jacobite
historians, like Dr Frank McLynn -- is that the Prince would have taken
London, and would have carried the day; little more than a mob stood,
shaking in their boots on Finchley Common, between the Prince and the
throne, and the serious Hanovarian forces were too far north to
intervene.
Charles Edward was let down by his character -- too many promises of
French support that failed to materialise -- and so lost the confidence
of his commanders. The key commander, Lord George Murray, was too
nervous, too narrow-minded, to appreciate the vital military principle
of concentrated force. Even then, having lost the argument, Charles
could have carried his cause: he could have gone to the clans over the
heads of the chiefs, marched on London himself, dared the Highlanders to
abandon him. But he did not. He turned tail and went home in a sulk. And
he began, then, the heavy drinking which would destroy him.
Then there is what we do know. That, after Culloden, death and
destruction swept the Highlands. Scotland as a whole was, for many
years, marginalised in the Union. The clan chiefs grew distant from
their people.
There came kelp, sheep, the Clearances and Balmorality. Had I been on
the scene 200 years ago, I think I should have fought for George II --
if at all. But it is hard, reviewing subsequent Highland history, in
1995 to believe that what would have befallen us after Charles Edward's
success would have been as appalling as the fruits of his failure.
There is also Charles Edward himself. When the last of the Stuart line
was safely dead, and Sir Walter Scott got to work, Jacobitism was
rehabilitated, glamourised. Even Queen Victoria could delight in a
courtier's gracious (if improbable) flattery that she physically
resembled the Young Pretender. For 100 years, bookshelves on the 45
groaned under the volumes of sickly romantic claptrap, their authors as
keen to pledge present fealty for the House of Windsor as they were to
deify Charles Edward Stuart.
Nearer our own time, reaction set in. Gordon Donaldson and others
demolished the man and his cause. It has taken such as McLynn, or Bruce
Lenman, in recent years to restore perspective to these events.
Charles Edward, of course, was romantic. He was tall, witty, merry and
-- by the foppish standards of his day -- very handsome. He had a shrewd
gift for show and pageant, When, in 1715, his father had landed briefly
at Peterhead, the Old Pretender faced the Jacobites in drab guard,
unbending pomposity, and rigid formality. Charles Edward swathed himself
in tartan, circulated freely, laughed a great deal,and personally tended
to the wounded after Prestonpans.
It must be said of him -- unlike his efficient but evil cousin, the
Duke of Cumberland -- that Charles Edward was an honourable soldier. He
eschewed all atrocities, insisted on care for the casualties of both
sides, and shrank even from the most necessary extremes of military
discipline.
He was a good deal more able than we gave him credit for. He could
speak the principal European Languages; by the time he fled to France,
in September 1746, he had actually mastered Gaelic. He was supremely
fit. He could swim strongly and was an astonishing shot, able to bring
down game on the wing. On a thousand shortbread tins Charles Edward may
look like a painted poof. He was actually a tough and interesting guy.
He lost, at the last, because of a fatal lack of character. Character
is known only in adversity, and adversity did not become the Stuarts.
Defeated, imprisoned, exiled, all that line tended to lapse into
psychopathic religiosity or the charms of poxy mistresses. Charles
Edward took to the bottle. He blamed everyone but himself. Petulantly he
took an interest in affairs, post-Derby, only to meddle and carp and
complain.
He had a fatal inability to assess the men about him, and put more and
more confidence in various disreputable Irishmen even as he berated and
riled the tedious, but gifted, Lord George Murray. It was Charles
Edward, personally and pig-headedly, who insisted on the disastrous
stance at Drummossie Moor, resisting all beseeching to withdraw to a
more sensible spot for a Highland Army.
When he left Scotland, he was still only 26 years old. He had another
40 years to live. He spent them in drink and vainglory refusing even to
remember what his lost cause had brought to the Highlanders he genuinely
loved, and never saw again.

My job priest
Eric Kennedy spotlights a young man in a collar-and-no-tie job
JOHN Bollan finds he doesn't have much time to himself, being in a job
where, as he puts it, you ''live above the shop''.
It means he is on duty virtually all the time, and when he wants a
long lie on his day off, he heads for his mother's home in Greenock the
night before. That way he can lie undisturbed until 11am.
It doesn't sound much of a job: only one day off a week, a pittance of
a salary, and no career prospects in the ordinary sense of the term. But
John Bollan knew what he was taking on when he went in for it: the Roman
Catholic priesthood tends to mean shouldering other people's problems at
the drop of a hat. And in case you didn't know, marriage is a no-no.
The joke is, John Bollan wasn't all that religious as a youth, and
wouldn't have gone out of his way to go to mass. He ran around with
girls, and still values those relationships, but had always wanted to be
a lawyer and had in fact embarked on legal studies at Edinburgh
University in 1986 when he began to feel a really strong pull to the
priesthood.
He had started thinking about it during his final year at St Columba's
High School in Gourock, but decided he had to give university a chance.
He lived in digs and got involved in the social life, but the scene just
wasn't fulfilling enough.
He made what he calls a ''leap of faith'', gave it all up, and went to
the Scots College in Rome, the major seminary for Scottish students.
It was a hard slog, lasting nearly eight years and involving studies
of philosophy, theology, scripture, and doctrine. For much of the time
he attended the famous Gregorian University. And he met the Pope four
times, ''just exchanging pleasantries''.
His family, who had initially been shocked at the idea of abandoning
his legal ambitions on what looked rather like a whim, had come round to
the idea of him being a priest, and there was a lot of pride when he was
ordained in his home parish in Greenock last June.
After brief ''work experience'' in two Paisley parishes, and a few
months back in Rome to sit final exams and complete a thesis on St
Thomas More, he got his first permanent appointment as an assistant
priest in St Joseph's, Clarkston.
That was in February, and he is adjusting well to the routine and to
working along with parish priest Gerry Brennan. ''I like to think I am
in a job which helps people,'' he says.
''But I'm not happy about the way the Church is seen by the world at
large to have a 'downer' on society. Perhaps it should do more to
explain why it teaches what it believes.''
He describes his musical tastes, appropriately, as catholic, but it
comes as a slight shock to hear that he loves Annie Lennox. He
immediately redresses the balance by expressing an equal fondness for
Palestrina and Monteverdi.
Well, he did say catholic . . .

<HEADLINE>Hopes for early progress appear remote.  Landowners seek law reform</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Landowners' Federation has renewed a campaign for reform
of farm tenancy laws with the publication of a paper setting out its
vision of the way forward.
The hopes of early progress seem remote, however. The National
Farmers' Union of Scotland remains opposed to the kind of changes sought
by the SLF, which would effectively sweep away the secured tenancy
system in Scotland.
In the past, Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, Sir Hector Monro,
has indicated that agreeement between the landowners and the NFUS would
be a pre-requisite for any changes in legislation.
Mr Graeme Gordon, federation convener, described his group's paper as
a preliminary to the resumption of talks with the NFUS later this year.
Present legislation was out of date and by giving security of tenure
for unlimited generations was leading to a shortage of land to let, he
said. ''We see the present legislation as a barrier to the modern,
flexible use of land, not only for agriculture but for woodland
management, conservation and diversification.''
A review of the tenancy laws would create a renewed interest on the
part of landlords in releasing land for rent, making it easier for new
entrants to get a start in farming, he suggested. In its paper, the
federation suggests there should be no restriction on the number of
years to be covered by a new tenancy agreement.
At the moment many farmers and landlords were resorting to the device
of the limited partnership as a means of getting round the existing
legislation, he said.
The working farmer leased the land, for an agreed period, and the
landlord was the ''limited'' partner. It could be a complicated
arrangement, with the need for a separate business centred on the leased
farm with separate accounts and, preferably, separate banking
arrangements.
''If you have a law that can be completely by passed it isn't working
-- so why have it?'' he asked.
He suggested that much of the basic structure of the reformed law on
the letting of agricultural land which would come into effect in England
and Wales this September could also be appropriate for Scotland.
The alternative was that there would be distrotions in market forces
and and Scottish agriculture would suffer froma lack of investment
compared with England and Wales.
Commenting on the SLF proposals, Ian Melrose, NFUS legal adviser, said
initial talks with the federation had broken down when over the length
of a minimum rental term. The NFUS wanted 15 years and the federation's
target then was 10.
''Now they (federation leaders) are saying there should be no minimum
term -- that to me is going back a step,'' said Mr Melrose.
He questioned whether many new entrants would wish to commit
themselves to setting up on a farm if they did not have some long-term
lease. On the issue of limited partnerships he pointed out that the Land
Court had accepted them as a valid way of setting up an agricultural
tenancy in Scotland. It might be wise now to wait and see how the new
arrangements worked in England and Wales, he said.
The SLF has also published its views on the forthcoming Scottish White
Paper on Rural Policy. The federation calls for an integrated approach
to the rural land-based economy with recognition of the importance pf
alternative land uses such as forestry, acquaculture, and field sports

On the back of the fledgling Scottish film industry's first flights,
Dick Louden visits a film workshop which is expanding its facilities
ON Thursday evening the Glasgow Film and Video Workshop (GFVW) hosts a
reception to mark the opening of its extensive new premises in Albion
Street in Glasgow's Merchant City.
At a time when the success of Shallow Grave and now Carrington -- the
winner of two major awards at the Cannes Film Festival -- has enhanced
the status of the Scottish film industry, it is fitting that GFVW is
embarking upon a new phase of expansion. Film-making in Scotland is
becoming big business.
Thursday's reception marks the start of a busy week in which GFVW is
throwing open its doors, not only to the film-making community but to
anyone interested.
Panasonic will be running video editing workshops on three days, using
its own state-of-the-art equipment. Another workshop will be conducted
by the renowned film-maker Ken Loach. There will be screenings of
members' work, whether completed works or pieces still in progress.
High-quality work from a film school in Chicago will also be shown.
There will even be an open day for parents and children, because GFVW
has its own junior branch for those under 16 and is keen to expand
interest and membership among the young. Again there will be workshop
sessions, including demonstrations of pop-video production.
Many agencies have contributed financially towards the refurbishment
of the premises, including Glasgow Development Agency, the Scottish Film
Council, Glasgow District and Strathclyde region. Nearly half of the
funding has been made available through the European Regional
Development Fund.
In its spacious new surroundings, GFVW is in a position to offer an
impressive array of facilities. These range from recording and sound
studios, preview theatre and training areas to film and video editing
suites, an information resource area, production offices and meeting
rooms.
Since the premises extend to 6500 sq feet, it is clear that this is an
organisation which thinks on the grand scale.
Indeed, GFVW is entitled to describe itself as ''a unique facility in
Scotland, occupying a crucial position in the infrastructure of the
Scottish film and television industry''.
A non-profit-making company with full charitable status, it sets out
to encourage film and video makers, from professionals to local
community groups, to take advantage of expert support and advice and to
hire quality equipment.
Membership of GFVW bestows an entitlement to hire a range of
VHS/U-matic and 8mm/16mm production and post-production equipment at
reasonable rates, to a 50% discount on film processing through
Technicolor and Rank Laboratories, and access to training surgeries in
any aspect of film and video making.
To reflect its commitment to wide access, GFVW has structured its
scale of annual membership fees in accordance with ability to pay.
Whereas the charge for a company is #53, it falls to #41 for voluntary
or charitable organisations and to #29.50 for community groups. For a
salary or wage earner the membership cost is #29.50, but it is reduced
to #18 for the low waged and to #11.75 for students and the unemployed.
GFVW's new location in the city centre will reinforce its status as a
focal point for the film and video-making community, where networking
and collaboration between film makers and visual artists can take place.
Apart from the hire of equipment, it offers numerous other facilities:
* A wide range of short training courses in video and film production
and post-production, run throughout the year
* A Screenworks Project which offers small funds and production
support to about 10 short films and videos commissioned by GFVW itself
* A Community Video Project, which enables members to gain hands-on
video experience and raises awareness of numerous social issues through
the medium of video
* A series of masterclasses conducted by key figures in the film and
television industry over an extensive range of topics
* Special events and talks arranged throughout the year with
professional and independent film-makers, artists and film and video
organisations.
In addition, anyone can organise training surgeries with an instructor
on an individual or group basis. If requested, GFVW can establish
contact with a suitable instructor and direct negotiations can then
follow, probably on the basis of an hourly fee of around #10.
GFVW's enthusiastic director, Janice Campbell, is keen to develop the
training dimension even further. ''We shall be offering training courses
all year round,'' she says. ''Many of them will be on the production and
editing side, but we shall also be catering for screenwriters. We find
that many of those in the film-making business feel least comfortable
with the writing side.''

INTERNET access is increasing at such a rate that teachers and
educationalists can no longer afford to ignore it. Outwith the media
hype and buzz words, however, most people remain largely ignorant of the
Internet and the information resources held within it.
To combat this, the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has
set up a project to teach teachers and education specialists the
fundamentals of the net.
''The idea is that staff in the schools have heard of the Internet but
do not really know what it is,'' says Jim Devine, education officer at
the Hunterian Museum, ''so we have put together this pilot project
entitled Introduction to the Information Superhighway, which is intended
for teachers from both primary and secondary schools.''
Mr Devine is aware of the apprehension which many teachers may feel
towards such a project. ''A lot of people are technophobic, so what we
are trying to do is to show them that the Internet is actually quite
simple. We take them by the hand through the World Wide Web, show them
that it is simple, and show them that there are masses of resources, all
of which are entirely free,'' says Mr Devine.
The one-day session by the Hunterian Museum consists of a morning of
lectures intended to equip teachers with a basic knowledge of the
Internet and its structure, followed by an afternoon of Internet
surfing. ''The course will get people ready for the Internet coming into
the classroom. Each teacher gets the chance to get used to the Internet:
teach them and they can go back and teach their pupils,'' says Mr
Devine.
He is keen to point out that the Internet is not the sole preserve of
the scientist and science teacher, indeed his sessions are intended
primarily for teachers of the arts.
''The Internet is essential to the arts; look at America where schools
are linking up to other schools across the world and learning about each
other's culture.
''Also, with Glasgow being the City of Architecture in 1999, we hope
to get schools to work on architecture and design projects and then we
hope to get them linking together so that they can share their
information and their experiences,'' says Mr Devine.
The sessions have also received the backing of Strathclyde region's
educational development service. Divisional officer Stuart MacDonald
sees three main thrusts behind the scheme: ''to raise awareness of what
the Internet can be used for, especially in art and design, to give
teachers some hands-on experience and to explain the implications of the
Information Superhighway.''
Mr MacDonald stresses that the Internet is already being put to
educational use within Strathclyde region. ''There are a number of
interesting projects such as primary schools linking up with schools in
Kentucky. It gives schools ccess to a fantastic range of information
resources of all kinds, and allows students to share projects,
experience and ideas.''
Demand for access to the Internet is mushrooming and, although only
between 10% and 15% of Scottish schools are currently on the net, at
present rates of growth every person on the planet could be on the
Internet by the year 2003. However, as always, access will be limited by
economics.
In one of the lectures included in the morning session, Dr Peter Kemp,
head of information technology at the University of Glasgow, points out
that, because of the need for high band-width telephone lines, the
information superhighway is still a long way off for many.
'' There is a big discrepancy because of the use of cable television
franchises. In Scotland, only the Central belt and little bits around
Aberdeen and Dundee have cable franchises. In fact, what is happening is
that we are getting better access for those who already have it; there
is not much cable TV in Drumchapel. We are seeing better services for
the haves and worse services for the have-nots,'' says Dr Kemp.

more technologically advanced, his e-mail address is:

Chris Holme finds Edinburgh schoolchildren tucking into healthy snacks
at playtime, courtesy of a community-based initiative.
SCOTTISH schoolchildren are snacking their way into an early grave,
well ahead of their European counterparts. However, the trend is being
bucked by a pioneering initiative in Edinburgh, only just saved from
extinction two months ago but which now offers a lesson for schools all
over the country.
Barri Grub started out in late 1992 with funding from the Pilton
Partnership. Fresh fruit at affordable prices has never got into
Muirhouse or Pilton, both areas of multiple deprivation, and, unlike
more prosperous suburbs, not served by a Safeway or Sainsbury.
The money ran out in April when the Edinburgh Healthcare NHS Trust
came to the rescue with #25,000 to keep it going for another year. Sir
John Crofton, this year's recipient of the prestigious Edinburgh Medal,
also donated part of his prize to the project.
Barri Grub delivers healthy snacks to three Edinburgh primaries every
morning and runs its own tuck shop at a fourth. It was born out of
simple desire to give local kids something better, but in its
development has been a model of innovative marketing.
That started with the name itself, which befuddled a visiting Russian
delegation until it was translated to great food.
But we all know that children prefer fat-laden snacks and fizzy
sugared drinks for a playpiece rather than fruit.
''That's a load of rubbish,'' said Barri Grub project leader, Marilyn
Beagley.
''Half the time it is because they have not been given the
opportunity. We see about 4000 kids a month and they are really keen.
Demand has always been increasing and we have only ever had one
complaint.''
Fruit is bought in wholesale, dependent on what is in season, then
packaged into snacks for 5p or 10p. The menu now extends to guava,
mango, and passion fruit.
''In the first year we took the basic fruit that kids are used to,
like apples and oranges,'' Mrs Beagley said.
''They we took Kiwi fruit, cherries and melon to let them try it.
There is also dried fruit and nuts, or when peaches and pears are cheap,
we get them. Strawberries are the favourite.''
''A few weeks ago there was dental health week and a lot of the kids
were eating fruit. But it is no use just for a week. They should be
eating fruit all the time.
''We started with 10 volunteers and now there are three paid workers,
all people from the area. We do not preach to the children. It is not as
if we are health professionals telling them what to do.
''I am just a local mum trying things on my own kids as well. We know
that we all have to try and eat healthy food but that's difficult if you
don't have the resources.''
Given its community-based roots and philosophy, Barri Grub has managed
to achieve something that evades most health promotion initiatives.
Peer-group pressure in the playground, consciously or otherwise, now
militates for healthy eating.
At Royston primary where the van arrives every morning break, head
teacher Joan Brear said: ''It is just a normal part of the school. Kids
are walking around eating fruit at playtime whereas in the past they
would have toffee or sweets. It has been an excellent idea, and the
variety of fruit means that their interest is always sustained.''
Barri Grub has plans for expansion into a further six primaries in
north-west Edinburgh as well its cooking demonstrations and other work
with the elderly and mother and toddler groups.
Along with similar groups in Wester Hailes and Calder, Barri Grub set
up the Edinburgh Healthy Eating Project. Its aim is to assist food
co-operatives throughout the city via a central warehouse and raise
awareness of healthy eating.
Last month the Scottish Office awarded it a #44,000 capital grant plus
#153,000 a year for the next four years.
Not bad going for a project which was about to fold for lack of
funding.
Picture of health points to parents
BARRI Grub is also one of the few successes in the wake of the report
on the Scottish Diet, by Professor Philip James and colleagues two years
ago, which identified the appalling eating habits of Scottish
schoolchildren.
The report underlined the importance of good nutrition to avoid
increased risk of premature death from cancer or heart disease in later
life.
It exposed the conceit we have all developed about our supposed
healthy eating. We think we are giving children more healthy food, when
the opposite is happening.
Although poor nutrition has always been linked to deprivation, the
poverty of the Scottish diet extends to better-off areas as well as
housing schemes. In many cases, juvenile malnutrition is worse in
middle-class homes because of dietary ignorance among parents who spend
more on food and believe they know better.
There is a generational gulf in how people regard their diet. Fruit
and fresh vegetables were prized by our grandparents, who grew up in
post-war austerity. Curiously, it was the Second World War and its
enforced rationing which also witnessed the biggest improvements in
Scotland's health, as measured in indicators like maternal and infant
mortality rates.
However, the diet of British schoolchildren has deteriorated markedly
in the last decade. Sweets are now the second biggest contributor to
daily energy intakes of 11 and 12-year-olds, followed closely by chips,
thus resurrecting the fictional Fat Boab into classroom reality.
The nutritional record of Scottish children is poorer than those in
the rest of the UK and for tooth decay is worse still.
The James report recommended doubling of both fruit and vegetable
intake, and all children above the age of two to drink semi-skimmed
rather than whole milk, a proposal ignored by the Government in setting
specific targets.
''The typical Scottish child is disadvantaged from birth by not being
breast-fed, receives solid food in the inappropriate form of cereal
foods too early in life, is weaned on to the unhealthy diet and
establishes a dietary pattern which is too high in fat, in refined
extrinsic sugars and in sodium,'' it said.
''The usual Scottish diet consumed by children is also that which we
would now expect to be conducive to the development of adult chronic
diseases. Data from other countries allows us to predict confidently
that the blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels of Scotland's
children are likely to be tracking along some of the highest values
found internationally.''
Two years later and Professor James, director of the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, sees little grounds for optimism.
''What the Barri Grub project is doing is great but we need to do
something on a national basis,'' he told The Herald.
''We have a slightly crazy approach in Scotland. We are so obsessed
with freedom of choice that we have forgotten about educating and
informing children about what they should eat. It is a major task,
because we do not realise there is a huge problem.
''I think we have to take a totally different approach to change the
attitudes of parents and teachers in schools.''
In fairness, it takes time to change ingrained attitudes but progress
is being made. For example, Strathclyde's Catering Direct has launched a
major initiative in primary schools. Called Keeping Your Balance, it
aims to convince both pupils and their parents that healthy eating can
also be enjoyable eating.

ANYONE wondering what the very wonderful Royal Bank of Scotland plans
to do with the money it will save after defenestrating 250 managers
should have a look at a recent press advertisement.
''The new force in corporate banking,'' says the copy. ''A massive
investment in people, technology, and products. A can-do philosophy,
winning against all comers.'' And so, breathlessly, on.
All this, we might add, in an effort to attract folk ''hungry to use
technology to solve business problems''. Specifically, ''talented young
systems professionals'', each of whom is invited to apply to an address
in darkest London for a job, with the Royal Bank of Scotland, in London.
Flesh-and-blood bank managers facing redundancy elsewhere may
meanwhile take such comfort as they can from the ad's headline: ''You've
achieved so much -- and you're still HUNGRY''.
Over at Barclay's, they're just as adventurous. Faced with the threat
of another day of strike action from employees who, given the nature of
their trade, can calculate the difference between executive pay and
their own salaries, the bank is planning a ''virtual mall'' on the
Internet's World Wide Web.
We look forward to the virtual pickets.
Beyond belief
MONEY, of course, is one of those mysterious ways in which He moves,
his fiscal policies to perform. For that reason, perhaps, a recent
Harris poll finds that 70% of Americans believe their financial
situation is ''at least somewhat'' a reflection of ''God's regard for
them''. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people with lower incomes ''are more
likely to believe'' this proposition.
(Stop press: supreme being imposes incomes policy.)
Given that He helps those who help themselves (presumably a reference
to the board of British Gas), we also hear tell of good Christians in
Athens, Alabama, just filled with the holy entrepreneurial spirit. There
the Union Hill Cumberland Presbyterian Church has just raised $2500 by
staging a ''Coon Hunt for Christ''.
According to the Reverend Charles Hood, ''The coon hunt is a way to
spread the word of God, to talk about Jesus Christ''. St Francis of
Assisi was not available for comment last night.
Booming business
STILL on the subject of Him, astronomers in Pittsburgh announced
yesterday that they have discovered an important missing link in the
evolution of the universe and confirmed a 30-year-old prediction of the
Big Bang theory. The scientists at John Hopkins University, who know
about such things, say they have found crucial evidence of the existence
of helium 10 billion years ago.
It's official then: someone left the gas on.
Latest news
BBC Scotland, allegedly plotting to replace the London Six O'Clock
News with a product of its own, will be cheered to learn that such
behaviour is fast destroying all that is wonderful about the
corporation.
Such, at least, was the apparent suggestion this week in an
investigation by the Guardian, a London newspaper, into the Beeb's
''regional obsession''. This asserted, en passant, that ''implementation
of the BBC's regional policy is causing upset, loss of morale and, in
some instances . . . farce''. Those at Queen Margaret Drive who thought
they were merely implementing the corporation's charter are further
warned that decentralisation appears to be a ''triumph of ideology over
quality''.
Older readers may remember that the Guardian was once, in its great
days, edited and published in deeply regional Manchester.
Good scouts
THE household's youngest member has just joined the Cubs, we are proud
to report. Our satisfaction has nothing to do with any aptitude he might
have for sizzling carbonised sausages or field-stripping a loaded
woggle, but rather because he had the foresight to cross his fingers
behind his back while swearing the pint-sized paramilitaries' oath of
allegiance to God and the Queen. As every nine-year-old knows, this
invalidates all contracts.
Such behaviour is, however, quite in keeping with advanced thinking
within the Scouting movement, where doubt has already been cast on the
value of the promise. As Chief Scout Garth Morrison has said, in
reference to man who would be king: ''It will be hard for some people to
promise to do their duty to an adulterer''.
Happily, no such traitorous thoughts afflict the dibs and dobs of the
Scout Association of Australia. Republican ferment there may be, with
Prime Minister Keating promising a break with the Crown before the
twenty-first century is very old, but the Scouts are holding the line.
Chief Commissioner Dr William Wells said this week that as long as
Mother Windsor was Queen of Australia the Scouts would go on promising
to do their duty by her and would only change -- clearly a momentous
prospect -- if there was a referendum or an act of parliament.
The constitutional significance of this ringing declaration was not
immediately clear, but Dr Wells also promised, presumably for the
benefit of those fearing a coup attempt by spotty patriots armed with
long sticks, that the Scouts remain an apolitical organisation.
Gump diplomacy
MEANWHILE, we hear that China has taken another step closer to
capitalism with the opening in Beijing of the movie Forrest Gump, fourth
in a series of 10 Hollywood pictures to be given official blessing. Life
in the People's Republic being anything but a box of chocolates it is,
by all accounts, already a big success.
Those who remember anything of the movie's plot, however, can only
wonder what it will do to the education of young Chinese, since one
episode depicts the fictional idiot Gump helping the real idiot Richard
Nixon with ''ping-pong diplomacy'' in the seventies.
Why can't these people watch proper, historically accurate pictures
that give a true sense of the past? Braveheart, say, or Rob Roy?
For the record
LET'S see if we've got this right. Margaret Thatcher thinks highly of
Tony Blair and Tony Blair quite admires Margaret Thatcher. Neither has
any time for John Major and Thatcher claims there are members of the
Cabinet who actually support her. When asked, however, all the members
of the Cabinet say they support John Major.
Meanwhile, left-winger Ken Livingstone says Blair is the most
right-wing leader Labour has ever had but could, in consequence, become
the greatest they have ever had just as his parliamentary colleagues are
attacking the Tories for being ''hopelessly split'' for backing Major
(who hates their leader) while supporting Thatcher (who rates him). Or
vice-versa.
Is there a Liberal in the House?

Philip Cowan learns that parents are being encouraged to find out what
is going on in the class and to help their children cope.
IT is a common concern amongst teachers that the only parents they see
are those they do not need to, and even then, only once a year at
parents' evenings.
In Paisley, an innovative project called the Home School Employment
Partnership (HSEP) has been set up to try to remedy this.
Begun in 1991, HSEP is funded through the Urban Aid Programme by the
Scottish Office and Strathclyde region, and works in Ferguslie Park and
Shortroods.
These areas have a history of deprivation and social problems, and the
project tries to bring the parents and pupils into contact with the
school and increase the pupil's achievement.
Working with parents and teachers from Castlehead, Merksworth and St
Mirin's High schools, as well as the numerous primary, special and
nursery schools that feed into them, the project officers deal with many
different children, parents and teachers.
At the heart of their strategy are the home visits, which involve a
project officer visiting the home to discuss any problems and to
encourage mums and dads to become involved in their child's education.
The three important phases in a child's education are the transitions
from nursery to primary, primary to secondary, and secondary school to
the wider world. Partnership visits usually tie in with these times when
there may be anxiety about change and reassurance is needed.
Josephine Clark, from Ferguslie Park, who has three children, all
still at school, felt it was not only her children who benefited from
the visits.
''It has made me much more confident and increased my interest in
education.''
Margaret Canning, also from Ferguslie Park, who has eight children,
agreed.
''I was encouraged to ask questions that I didn't think I had the
right to ask. That gave me the confidence to approach teachers, and
since then I have had a lot of contact with teachers concerning my last
three kids. With my first five, I did not have any at all, except when I
was sent for. ''
Pamela Robertson, a research officer at the Quality in Education
centre at Strathclyde University, recently completed a mid-term
evaluation of the project.
''Much of the existing research demonstrates very clearly that there
is a strong relationship between low school achievement and factors that
are associated with disadvantage.
''It is important that we should look at the whole picture -- at the
young person in their family setting and in school, and try to address
the issue of achievement from a number of standpoints.''
''The partnership tries to look at young people's culture, parental
attitudes and the attitudes of young people. Perhaps project officers
are not as constrained by the timetable and the curriculum as teachers.
They have got much more opportunity to look at the wider picture and use
a more diverse range of approaches.''
With 16 staff, the project does not come cheap -- its budget for
1995-96 is #372,450 -- but it has attracted praise from parents and
teachers alike. The initial signs are that it has been very effective.
With 2600 home visits and 1200 interviews with pupils in the 1992-3
school year, fourth-year pupil attendance at schools in the area has
increased by about 10%. Attendance at national examinations has also
improved, and as a result, the number of pupils achieving Standard
Grades has increased.
Project leader Anne Houston is keen to emphasise that this has been a
joint effort: ''There is no doubt that the project has influenced
attendance, but it is important to recognise the crucial roles of
schools and parents, so I wouldn't want the project to take credit for
that, but perhaps the project has been a catalyst.''
Initial signs indicate that the project is beginning to meet its prime
objective of improving the life chances of children by increasing their
achievement.
However, Pamela Robertson is cautious about exact figures: ''For such
a small group of young people, it is very difficult to make judgments
about achievements. It is important to have patterns of achievement over
several years and to have norms to compare them with -- norms for young
people who have experienced the same degree of disadvantage. We don't
have these so it is difficult to say exactly what progress is being
made.''
Mary Maxwell, a former English teacher at Merksworth High, Paisley,
has been a project officer with the partnership since August last year.
She said that before she left the classroom for the project, she
recognised there were additional wide-ranging issues, such as
unsatisfactory levels of literacy, to be adressed.
''The barrier to a pupil's education is often the parent's own
negativeexperience of school. I also feel the school system fails a lot
of people and there are a lot of active, intelligent parents, and if you
could tap into that, there could be a change for the next generation.''

Factoring is no longer the lender of last resort, as a young
businessman told Geraldine Abrahams.
THE buzz word in today's job marketplace is flexibility. For some, it
means survival, while for others, it is the opportunity to move
progressively in a direction that allows them to pursue achievable
goals.
Some have flexibility thrust upon them and the secret is to recognise
opportunities when they come along and be prepared to welcome change and
adapt to it.
When Tony Miller went to the Scottish Business School at the
University of Strathclyde to study for a degree in Business Law and
Marketing, he imagined that his future lay in marketing.
However, after only one year at university, his father died and he
took over the family business, continuing to attend and complete his
course at Strathclyde. Rather than looking on this as an extra burden,
Tony saw it as being ''good to be able to put some of the theory learnt
into practice''.
He gave himself six years to turn the family business around, then
sold it and started to think seriously about what he wanted to do with
his life. With information gleaned from a sister who at that time was
working in the financial marketplace as a private bank broker, together
with what he had learnt on his course, he became interested in working
in the stock market.
In some ways, his timing could not have been worse. The stock market
was still reeling from the effects of ''Black Monday''. There were few
vacancies and the future looked unsettled. Given those circumstances, he
worked for a year in marketing for an insurance company until an opening
came up at Barclays, the retail stockbroker, and he joined that company
as an order-taker with an eye to learning the business.
Tony's job there involved processing orders which encompassed gilts,
debentures, loan stocks, for example, and less than two years later, he
had passed his ''Registered Reps'' which meant that he could give advice
on the market.
This in turn led to a move into actual stockbroking, and as an
investment adviser, he began running portfolios for clients, taking
orders, and advising them on where their money should go. Again, he was
dealing mainly in equities, gilts, loan stocks, and debentures.
By this time, although the market itself had recovered, he could see
that the structure of the operation in which he was working was flat,
with no long-term future.
''It's great to enjoy what you are doing, and I loved the market, but
you have to live,'' he reflects. ''I could have gone to another broker
but it is not particularly well paid, and you have to look to the long
term.''
While he was working at Barclays, he had watched the progress of
Kellock, a Cashflow Finance company that came to Glasgow in 1990. The
Bank of Scotland had become the major shareholder in the company in
1987.
As factors and invoice discounters, Kellock provides essential
cashflow to businesses -- from those just starting ups to those with a
turnover of more than #50 million -- in the manufacturing, wholesale,
distribution, and service sectors.
When Kellock advertised in January, he responded and has been working
since then as a client manager for the company, a job which he sees as
having plenty of potential.
''Kellock is unique in the marketplace, because the client manager
will run all aspects of an account from allocating cash to invoices as
they come in, to risk management -- deciding on what funds should be
released, a decision based on a company's ledger,'' says Tony.
''Three types of companies will use the service -- a company that is
over-trading and has good orders on its books but cannot get the money
back in, a company that is just starting up and needs cashflow, and
those companies that are looking to expand.
''Factoring today is no longer the lender of last resort.''
His move to Kellock has meant a further increasing of Tony's skills
base. He brought with him his experience from running the family
business, and a knowledge of how companies fund from working in the
market.
He did not have much knowledge of the credit control or the legal side
of the business when he joined, but he has had extensive ''hands-on''
training, spending time with a senior client manager, and attending
in-house seminars. On top of which he has had regular visits from legal
and financial specialists as well as participating in a course run by
the Association of British Factoring Discounters. Kellock is one of the
12 members of ABFD, which accounts for over 90% of the UK's factoring
and invoice discounting.
Tony Miller's career progress is typical of the kind of flexibility
necessary in today's job market. It has been relatively diverse yet
nothing has been wasted, and each step has led to a further increase in
his knowledge base.
According to Tony, cashflow finance is a growth area, with increasing
numbers of jobs for those people with personality and experience as well
as suitable paper qualifications. At Kellock, where the service is based
on a one-to-one basis, a steady increase in clients will be reflected in
a relative expansion of the workforce.
Where would he like to see his own career going? He says: ''I have
found the operations side of the business to be an excellent grounding,
but I would like eventually to move in the new business side of things,
where I would go out to companies and take decisions on funding.''

* SCOTS were wary when the great property-owning bandwagon began its
dramatic acceleration in the mid-eighties. But as the figures show,
Scotland was pulled along in the slipstream.
Scotland still has the lowest level of owner-occupation and the
highest level of public-sector renting in the UK. Only 35% of Scots were
owner-occupiers in 1979. Now 57% of us own our own homes, and well over
half of these are former council houses.
The Government wants to see 60% of Scots owning their own homes by the
end of this parliament. In England, around 66% of houses are
owner-occupied, with only 18% of the population living in public
housing, against 35% here.
If an Englishman's home was his castle, his Scottish counterpart has
existed in an altogether more fragile economy, where insecurity of
employment was a fact of life. It was, probably, this collective
historical consciousness of the danger of debt in an uncertain economic
landscape which helps explain why Scotland escaped the nightmare legacy
of the boom-and-bust excesses of the housing explosion in England.

Margaret Vaughan finds Greenpeace in turmoil over its future strategy.
Is it time to eschew the eco-warrior image of derring-do days for the
role of Establishment insiders?
LYING full 13 fathoms deep, in waters not far from the spot where it
was blown up by French agents on a mission to halt its disruption of
nuclear tests a decade ago, the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior
remains a rusting monument to those heady founding days when a new
breed, the eco-warriors of the seas, were hailed the heroes of a new
environmentally conscious world.
A long way to come in a decade, from a rusting hulk to a luxury motor
yacht equipped with a heliport; from the hulk of the Rainbow Warrior to
the superior comforts of a vessel which has just finished a luxury
cruise charter in the Mediterranean.
Today's marauding squad of swashbuckling adventurers on the high seas
recline in spacious cabins aboard the Altair, their footfalls softened
by fitted carpets in the blue-upholstered stateroom, amid the varnished
veneer and potted palms of the cocktail bar
What's this? The eminence verte of the environmental campaigners
chartering a luxury yacht? Gone soft have they then? Slick, pale-green
PR machine is it?
Not really! But the campaign to stop Shell sinking the Brent Spar 291
miles off the Fair Isles, using all the expensive paraphernalia at their
disposal, including a helicopter, does signal a victory for those within
Greenpeace who argued that its campaigning methods had foundered on the
rocks of its own success. Derring-do has won the day -- if not the
battle -- over those who want a change of tack, to navigate the calmer
waters of corporate boardrooms.
If it's a far cry from that watery graveyard off the island of
Motutapere to the gunmetal seas of the Atlantic, it's an even longer
shout from a clutch of committed ecology freaks to one of the richest
environmental organisations in the world. That's how far Greenpeace has
come from its beginnings of two lifeboat dinghies, a ladder and a
boundless supply of idealism.
Today, more than #2m of its UK annual budget goes to fund the
international organisation which runs the ships that have made it
famous. It has 400,000 members in the UK. An income of #9m. Individual
members pay #14.50. A family membership is #18.
Internationally, the organisation boasts four million members across
30 countries. All 30 national groups donate 24% of their funds to the
international organisation. Its combined gross income is #100m. Not a
drop in the ocean. It refuses money from governments or industry, not
least because these are usually the targets of its campaigns.
From being not much more than a few men in a boat in Canada in 1970,
it has swelled into a worldwide organisation with more than 100 staff.
It has evolved into what is essentially a multi-national corporation of
environmentalists.
Now, many within and without the organisation think the time has come
to switch tack from consciousness-raising stunts to problem solving. New
tactics are needed now that the ideological battle for the environment
has been won, they argue.
Taking to the high seas in your inflatables and your anti-whaling ship
no longer has the novelty of those early days. The Greenpeace copyright
on high-profile direct action has been pirated by a new generation of
protesters who act with far greater freedom because they operate in
small cells, are unpaid, and do not answer to a central organisation.
For many of them, Greenpeace, now represents the Establishment.
Ironically, it may have become -- in the zealous eyes of this new
tree-climbing, calf hugging, road-blocking generation -- a victim of its
own success.
Greenpeace has had to make itself respectable in the world of
international lobbying. This meant curbing an early tendency towards
inexact science and dubious research. Now with the appointment of
figures such as Jeremy Leggett, formerly reader in earth sciences at
Imperial College London to the post of director of science, it is
invited into the debating chambers.
Last week, activists in suits and ties and power frocks joined the
meeting of North Sea Ministers to discuss the pollution crisis. It may
make the new generation of green activists uncomfortable, but says
Greenpeace, there is no contradiction: ''Our lobbyists dressed up in
suits to do establishment work are acting in a way that is completely
different from the people involved on the Brent Spar. It's a different
aspect of the same work. One complements the other,'' argues spokesman
Adam Woolf.
The trouble is that the same organisation cannot easily comprise
smooth lobbyists and derring-do diehards. Talk to seventies' Greenpeace
people and the refrain is the same; the organisation has gone smooth and
soft, it's too bureaucratic, there's not enough good old-fashioned
confrontation.
Like many organisations made up of committed but anarchic individuals,
its history is littered with blood-lettings and in-fighting. Two years
ago it made about 100 staff redundant. Internationally, membership had
slipped by more than a quarter, income declined by 13%. But donations
and membership don't tell the whole story. In the UK, for example, both
held up well. Income is now only 10% below its 1990 peak. Membership has
never been higher.
Yet internal battles over control of the organisation threatened to
sink it. Last November the organisation was warned by its founder David
McTaggart, who called a crisis meeting in Tunisia, that it had strayed
from its original campaigning work, which he insisted should take
precedence over paper-pushing and meetings.
The battle over control of Greenpeace International, based in
Amsterdam, began two years ago and has grown more intense.
There were arguments over whether to concentrate the organisation's
power base in rich countries such as Britain, Germany, the Netherlands
and America or to spread out to cover poorer areas where environmental
problems are pressing. The biggest single contributor to Greenpeace
funds is Germany, with the Netherlands second and Britain and America
about equal third. American donations dropped after the Gulf war,
because of the organisation's opposition to the fighting.
It was the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior which led to a huge rise in
donations and the green boom of the late-eighties built up membership.
Now many within Greenpeace fear its place at the radical edge of the
green movement was being taken over by groups like Earth First, an
import from America which organises itself in cells and has no leaders.
Instead of fundraising for campaigns, Earth First relies on cell members
to take direct action.
Now, as the luxury chartered yacht carrying a new generation sails on
for further confrontations with Shell in the deep waters of the
Atlantic, it is clear who is at the helm for today. Whether the warriors
will chart a new course for tomorrow's battles is altogether another
question.

Jimmy Reid consider whether
divine intervention should figure
when studying racing form
HORSE racing is fascinating because you have to take account of so
many factors. First of all the horse; its abilities, has it been
overworked or underworked, has the handicapper got its measure or has it
something in hand, the distance, the going, the contours of the course,
the jockey -- and if you get these things right, there are the
imponderables.
On the day of the race the horse might be cheesed off for no apparent
reason. A young stallion, despite the bromide, might still have his mind
on other things. That's why they geld some. It apparently concentrates
the mind.
I backed the winner of the Derby and was delighted, more for getting
it right than for the winnings. There were doubts about whether many in
the field could go the distance. Others were gallopers and lacked the
class for the Derby. The hot favourite had shown he wasn't happy with
less severe undulations than he had to confront at Epsom. This left
Lammtarra who had only one outing to his credit, which he won, but such
inexperience is no recommendation for the most difficult flat race in
the world. On the other hand, no flaws had as yet been revealed, and he
was superbly bred.
My theory, which might be scientifically flawed, is that the genetic
pool of modern thoroughbred horses has been so refined that it is now a
more reliable guide to potential than ever before. This reasoning
pointed to Lammtarra.
According to Walter Swinburn, the winning jockey, this victory had
nothing to do with breeding, training, the skills of handlers and his
own jockeyship. God had willed that this horse should win and, of
course, it duly obliged.
According to Walter, who must have a hotline to Heaven, God's
reasoning was as follows: Alec Stewart, a Scot, who was an outstanding
trainer and judge of horses, and Lammtarra's original trainer, had been
shot dead last year. He was such a good guy that God decided to reward
him by giving the race to Lammtarra.
Why do people fork out lots of cash for thoroughbreds and employ
skilled and gifted trainers, with expensive facilities, experienced
stable-hands, veterinary back-up and so on when all that's needed is a
word in the ear of God? Cancel Sporting Life!
Light some candles and remember the wee ones are for greyhounds. Face
Mecca in the morning and ask Him to mark your card. Go dutifully to the
synagogue and implore that one a day would do nicely.
Now according to some, God is riding shotgun on football as well.
After the Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won, Tommy Burns, the
manager, came to the press conference, entwined his hands, looked to the
heavens, and said: ''I want to thank God for our victory.''
Did Airdrie know of God's involvement? Is this allowed under SFA
rules? Alex McDonald could have said: ''My boys knew they would be under
the cosh when they heard that God in mufti was sitting on the Celtic
benches at the right hand of Tommy Burns.''
There is at least one snag in this. If Celtic had lost, would Tommy
have blamed God? Would he have told the assembled scribblers: ''God let
us down. He never really got into the game. Maybe he needs a few days at
Seamill.''
Nobody minds a ''Thank God'' or a ''By Jove''; it's when they get
serious that it becomes worrying.
I remember Peter Aliss commentating on an Open golf championship. A
young Spaniard was forlorn in the depths of a bunker. Peter described
the difficulties of the shot and the mechanics of good bunker play. Just
before he struck the ball, the Spaniard made the sign of the cross.
Peter, in a hushed voice, opined: ''He's appealing for help to an
outside agency''. The ball hit the lip of the bunker and dropped back to
where it was before. Peter concluded: ''See, you can't trust nobody
nowadays.''
If you seriously believe that in sport God is on your side then by
definition he's against the other side, unless they have another God who
is on their side, and sport becomes a Holy War or fatwa, and that sure
as hell ain't good.
But the idea of God floating around with a mobile phone ready to act
as a fixer in sport is highly insulting to Him who must have his hands
full with ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the starvation of millions of
helpless souls in the Third World, the pollution of our atmosphere and
its threat to life on this planet, not to speak of Aids. If He has time
to intervene in horses and football then his priorities are wrong.
There is an old saying: ''God helps those who help themselves.'' Jack
Nicklaus once said: ''The more I practice the luckier I get''. And
that's about it. God or genetics give us potential talents and
abilities. The rest is up to us. To suggest that someone or something
else is responsible is a cop-out.

IT IS very well for John Macleod to write (June 8): ''The bride of
Christ must speak with an authority which is not of this world. And she
does so because she is founded in supernatural proof. Her authority is
born of the unseen and the miraculous.''
There are people who actually believe this; there may be those who,
quite explicitly, do not. These are both minorities speaking to
themselves and, from time to time, shouting at one another.
The larger fact is that the statement I have quoted is simply
unintelligible to most people; they do not disagree with it; they cannot
even begin to relate to such statements.
It is because John Macleod, and the tiny minority he speaks for, fail
to see how utterly alien their thoughts are to those of most people that
they can make such points as ''when the doctrines are gone the ethics
are sure to follow''.
The doctrines have indeed almost gone and many people who profess to
believe in them actually seem to believe in a version of them that is so
diluted as to be nugatory. None the less most people behave as well as
they always did and in many ways ethical concerns have rarely been
stronger.
What is needed more than anything else is the public articulation of a
positive liberal secular ethic to focus the thoughts of the vast
majority who are unimpressed by religious doctrine and, in any case,
manage their lives very well without it.
We humanists observe that people are actually put off by megaphone
piety; they are usually ready to discuss issues arising in this life
lived in this, the natural world.

JIM COOK'S letter gives a splendid demonstration of turning logic on
its head (From a pagan point of view, June 10).
He refers to what he calls ''the (Catholic) Church's socially divisive
segregated schools policy''. Further, he claims that this ''perpetuates
the conditions for sectarianism''.
First, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland welcomed the provisions
contained within the Education Scotland Act of 1918 which provided for
state funding of Catholic schools.
This seemed necessary at the time to both the Church and the
Government as anti-Catholicism was widespread. Hostility to Catholics
was overt, often violent in nature, and not confined either to the
Saturday in July immediately preceding the 12th, or to members and
supporters of the Orange Order.
Secondly anti-Catholicism as a way of life is still, sadly, prevalent
in this country. It is therefore prudent for the Church to continue to
enforce its rights under the Education Act. This policy, rather than
perpetuating sectarianism, is a response to it.
Having taught for 15 years in a Catholic school, I can assure your
readers that within Catholic schools sectarianism is not taught or
tolerated, let along promoted. Neither is sectarianism promulgated from
our pulpits.
Sectarianism is promoted and encouraged in other institutions in this
country, but I have no mandate to speak of matters related to what goes
on in premises to which admittance is denied me for reasons of my
membership of, and adherence to, the Catholic Church.

ALISTAIR CAMPSIE seems to confuse mythology with musicology (June 10).
MacCrimmon as a legend, as a literary device, like Robin Hood or
Nasreddin Hodja, accumulates stories. We have at least six stories that
tell how the MacCrimmon family ''acquired the gift of piping''. They are
all different and they all involve fairies.
As far as battles are concerned, we have stories that tell how
''MacCrimmon'' personally altered the course of the Battle of Waternish,
and was seen at the Battle of Worcester. And so on. The point was not
that a particular pipe was there, or at Moy or Inverurie, but that
MacLeod levies definitely were, and the seannachies used such devices to
string stories together.
After all, it would be assumed that if ''our lads'' were there, a
MacCrimmon piper would have been there with them. These are stories, not
reports from war correspondents.
As to the true compositional history of any particular piobaireachd,
we definitely belong to the Greensleeves-was-written-by-Henry-VIII
school of music research. Like the seannachies, we try to keep things
simple.

UNFORTUNATELY the word ''for'' was cut from the third paragraph of my
letter (June 10) giving it the totally opposite meaning.
In fact the MacLeods of Dunvegan, and thus Donald Ban MacCrimmon,
fought for King George II, under the command of ''Butcher'' Cumberland,
against Prince Charles Edward Stuart, incidentally wearing Redcoasts and
Campbell tartan kilts.

Murray Ritchie reports from Luxembourg on how Britain is ready to give
ground over new powers for the European Parliament -- but the price will
be retention of the veto
BRITAIN appears prepared to drop John Major's opposition to more power
for the European Parliament as a bargaining counter against a weakening
of the United Kingdom's veto in the EU's Council of Ministers.
A senior Government source has made clear -- in the context of the
Strasbourg assembly's future -- that ''the Prime Minister wants a
certain scope for negotiation''. But British Government opposition to
more decisions in Europe being taken by majority voting remains total.
Signals sent out by the Government yesterday help to clarify British
attitudes to the crucial super-summit next year which will revise the
Maastricht treaty and could become the decisive issue in a British
General Election, which must be held by the spring of 1997.
Boxed between the hardline anti-EU rhetoric of Baroness Thatcher this
week, allied to the Portillo-led faction inside the Cabinet, and
Labour's softer line on Europe, the Government is now seeking to
distance itself from Tony Blair.
There also appears to be a realisation that John Major's blanket
refusal to negotiate on qualified majority voting (QMV) could backfire.
Other EU states, impatient with British intransigence, could simply
postpone the toughest decisions until after a British General Election
in the expectation that a Blair-led government would be more
co-operative.
Mr Major has made clear he will block any move to give the European
Parliament any new powers. Some time after he made that remark in a
speech in the Netherlands, his text was somewhat revised by a series of
ministerial pronouncements in which the Government said it would resist
any ''massive'' new powers for the Strasbourg assembly.
In successive speeches the word ''massive'' has been replaced by
''substantial'' and last week in Sicily the British Minister for Europe,
David Davis -- by his own admission -- devoted only half a sentence to
the subject when he held formal talks with his EU colleagues. He also
called for more decision-making powers for national parliaments which
could be a useful negotiating weapon.
Mr Davis was in Messina for the inaugural meeting of the EU's
Reflection Group, which will set the agenda for next year's
inter-governmental conference (IGC). It was there that the almost
complete isolation of Britain became brutally clear after Mr Davis's
blunt statement that the UK would oppose ''any'' extension of majority
voting. Some anxious Government thinking has been taking place since.
Observers have long suspected that Britain's hardline opposition to
more EU integration was too absolutist for negotiations to be realistic.
Signals from the Government now suggest that this has been accepted in
London and that a more sophisticated approach to the IGC is required.
Only the most insistent right-wingers among the Tories seriously dispute
the point.
At the same time, there are fresh hints from senior Government figures
that a public debate must be begun on such thorny questions as the
proposed single European currency, and the possible loss of the veto. Mr
Major banned his senior Ministers from discussing monetary union in
public because of the trouble it caused on his back benches. This policy
might now be softened.
A senior source remarked: ''It would be an error now to rule out
British participation (in a single currency) indefinitely.'' Government
figures also rue the fact that the debate so far on a single currency
and other vital EU issues has been ''somewhat shallow''. There are new
calls from high inside the Government for more attention to British
public opinion on Europe.
''People should pay attention to the market research,'' a senior
figure said yesterday -- an indication that the Tory Eurosceptics should
no longer have everything their own way. For some time there has been an
expectation that the Tory pro-Europeans would begin the fightback and
this remark could be their cue.
But some formula must be found to cover the deep divisions on Europe
inside the Conservative Party as the IGC (and possibly the election)
approaches. After the emergence of clearer indications of Government
thinking, it seems that a series of options is being considered which
would provide the Tories with a safety net on the crunch issue of QMV.
Mr Major is much encouraged by comments made last week by President
Jacques Chirac of France who said he could see no insurmountable problem
with the UK approach to the veto. Mr Chirac also helped Mr Major's cause
by promising a joint study of the whole question of a single currency,
including the effects on those currencies which remained outside the
promised economic and monetary union.
Putting off a decision on whether Britain should join a single
currency is the easy bit. Mr Major could merely decide to exercise
Britain's right to opt out of the process meantime even though, as seems
likely, the British economy meets the so-called convergence criteria for
joining laid down in Maastricht.
The criteria will not be changed at the IGC. This allows the Tories to
put the whole difficult question on ice until after a General Election.
They could encourage debate but take no action.
With the question of a single currency sidelined, the Conservatives
could concentrate on the veto, playing the nationalist card by being
seen to stand up for the nation state against perceived Brussels'
centralism. Given that they would probably eventually have to use the
veto -- thus wrecking the entire Maastricht revision process for
selfish, party-political reasons -- or suffer a humiliating climbdown,
they are likely to have their bluff called.
To avoid such a diplomatic catastrophe some formula must be found to
get them off the hook with dignity. This could involve writing the
so-called Luxembourg Compromise into the text of Maastricht 2. It is a
procedural device written into the rules of the Council of Ministers but
not into the treaty.
The compromise allows one country opposing a move agreed by the others
to plead it is a matter of vital national interest. The Luxembourg
Compromise has seldom been used, although France threatened to invoke it
recently in the controversy over the EU-US Blair House agreement which
affected French farming.
Another possible formula would involve the so-called ''coalition of
the willing'' in which states which agreed on a certain policy could
pursue it if they so wished without having to call in active support
from other members. This has echoes of the British hankering after a
''flexible'' European Union or the idea floated by France of a Europe of
''concentric circles'' -- in effect a multi-speed European Union.
British Government sources see events in Bosnia as a good example of
this theory working in practice. Britain and France -- the EU's two big
military powers -- have effectively taken over EU ground policy in
Bosnia (some would say they have hijacked it). Ministers look
approvingly on this as an example of how like-minded EU states can
co-operate closely. ''We see nothing wrong with that,'' a senior British
figure said.
But Government sources are careful to point out that this is not a
formally preferred or agreed option, merely an idea which is likely to
surface as the Reflection Group gets down to business. It is also
inextricably linked with the question of QMV because it goes straight to
the heart of the dispute about an EU common foreign and security policy
(CFSP), a section of Maastricht where there is no routine QMV procedure.
Britain and some other states prefer to remain independent in their
defence and security policies and will resist pooling their powers as
others wish under Maastricht 2.
Thus the British-French initiative in Bosnia now being pulled together
on the military, political and diplomatic fronts, is being hailed as a
fine example of how an agreed foreign policy can work without being
forced into the straitjacket of a treaty.
The problem is, of course, that this is the discredited EU's last
stand in Bosnia and if it fails, Britain and France will carry (not
altogether fairly) much of the blame. Government officials have made
clear that if it does collapse in ignominy the only option remaining
will be a humiliating retreat from the Balkans.
In those apocalyptic circumstances there would inevitably be a more
urgent review of the EU's ambition to have a common defence force -- and
that could rebound on British Ministers with a vengeance.
The almost complete isolation of Britain became brutally clear after
Mr Davis's blunt statement

THESE past four weeks have seen positive shifts in the Church scenery
of Scotland -- and furth of Scotland.
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, following a
constructive debate on the issue, has accepted an invitation from the
Scottish Episcopal Chruch to enter into ''direct negotiations'' for
union.
This move offers the hope of an accommodation between different forms
of church government -- supervision by a person (usually named bishop)
over against supervision by one's peers (often called presbyterian).
If the will is there, the Churches believe they can break the bishops'
barrier and accept the two forms of supervision alongside each other.
The second major shift was Cardinal Winning's warmly welcomed proposal
to the Kirk's General Assembly to hold an ecumenical assembly of all
Scotland's Churches in the year 2000. This proposal has been under
active consideration by an Action of Churches Together for Scotland
Commission for almost a year now. The Cardinal has given it a promising
profile.
Thirdly, the Pope's recent encyclical, ''Ut unum sint -- that they all
may be one'', has given a boost to the cause of unity between the
Churches. His letter encourages a new look by all Scotland's Churches at
the possibility of united witness, joint evangelical initiatives, and an
end to the wasteful divisions which have dogged Christ's one Church for
too long.
Fourthly, the Churches of Europe, Protestant, Orthodox, and Roman
Catholic, have resolved to hold a major European Ecumenical Assembly in
June 1997. The theme of this assembly will be reconciliation -- a theme
of which both St Ninian and St Columba would have warmly approved. It
happens that 1997 is also the year when we shall celebrate the witness
of Ninian and of Columba, since their respective centenaries fall in
that year.
The major ecumenical advances provide a new impetus for the Churches
to work together in accordance with the fervent prayer of Christ ''that
all His people might be one''.
As a celebration of their unity in Christ, the Churches are holding a
Scottish Christian Gathering in Inverleith Park, Edinburgh, on Saturday,
June 24. This day-long festival of ''faith in the future'' is open to
all -- and it's free. It will provide a ready test of my conviction that
the Church scene in Scotland looks brighter than for many a day.

LAST week's parliamentary debate (reported on June 8) about the ''not
proven'' verdict will hopefully see an end to attempts to change a
verdict which has given Scottish law the unique distinction of being
able to accommodate the numerous grey areas that lie between outright
guilt and complete innocence.
While everybody has sympathy for the sense of injustice that the Duffy
family must feel over the lack of a conviction for the appalling murder
of their daughter, their attempts, along with those of their MP, George
Robertson, to change matters appear to be based on a very simplistic
view of the law.
For instance Mr Robertson states that the ''not proven'' verdict
undermines the presumption of innocence while allowing the guilty to get
off. Surely it is the sole right of the jury to decide guilt, not Mr
Robertson. Indeed I can think of no more bizarre statement than Mr
Robertson's assertion that a person is presumed innocent unless they are
obviously guilty.
The argument about ''qualified innocence'' stigmatising people while a
''not guilty'' verdict would avoid this was blown apart by the Colin
Stagg case in England. There the judge directed that a ''not guilty''
verdict be found in favour of this unfortunate individual. Yet since
then he has been relentlessly harried by the press and the police who
remain convinced of his guilt.
Stigma exists to a greater degree in the two-verdict system simply
because somebody found ''not guilty'' on a technicality is defined as
having the same degree of innocence as somebody who was, say, found
''not guilty'' because the real killer had confessed during the trial.
The ''not proven'' verdict at least takes this into account as well as
recognising the pitfall of a jury being faced with insufficient evidence
to convict yet being reluctant to advocate release.
The significant number of innocent people wrongly jailed under the
English system in recent years is surely alarming testimony to the
inadequacies of the two-verdict system.
It is perhaps unfortunate that nobody saw fit to capitalise on the
very uniqueness of the ''not proven'' verdict as to make it the only
acquittal verdict whereby a person could be retried for the same crime
should fresh evidence become available.
This would at least have helped to avoid the appalling situation that
occurred recently when a misread verdict enabled two accused persons to
walk free.
That case simply reinforced the finality of the jury's verdict and
perhaps George Robertson should spend a little more time addressing that
particular enigma rather than presenting petitions to Parliament for the
removal of a verdict whose pragmatism is most definitely ''proven''.

ABOUT now was when some of the hardest-working people in the land went
to work. Day after day for three months they did not let up. Sometimes
they were chained to the oars at night. But it was while the sun shone
that in more than one way they sweated. Every evening about teatime they
prayed for rain. They were the seaside entertainers.
For their summer schools of toil they chose temples of leisure. And
they resorted to the best places.
Dunoon had its Cosy Corner. In Gourock it was the Cragburn. For their
palaces of sandy pleasure Aberdeen, North Berwick, and even Prestwick
had Beach Pavilions. Preeminently, Ayr has retained its Gaiety and
Rothesay won back its Winter Garden.
Summer shows were training courses. Young comics learned their trade
alongside chorus girls, not all of whom were young. They did two nightly
performances, with a change of bill every Monday and Thursday. Most
mornings were for rehearsal. Midnight matinees sometimes went on top.
Often it took a drizzly evening to get a paying house for wages which
were less than glamorous. When a dancer picked up a fiver a week, half
of it went on her digs. Dorothy Paul likes to recall how in her
apprentice days she sang for #l2, and all the pies she could eat.
Chic Murray did his first seaside turn for nothing. ''I got up this
morning. I like to get up in the morning; it gives me the rest of the
day to myself,'' he told mainly bemused holidaymakers in Carnoustie at
the Links Pavilion. He didn't tell them he was not getting paid for such
good stuff.
Casting two singers, four hoofers, and an accordionist, a pierrot
company ran to l5 or so. That was not counting the comics, although they
counted most. Folklore resounds with their names. Not in order of
appearance, they included Dave Willis, Alec Finlay, Billy Rusk, the
young Lex McLean, Tommy Lorne, ba'-faced Tommy Morgan. Even names which
never topped bills nor appeared in lights on the larger marquees have a
memorial place in the nation's nostalgia. Few are so fondly remembered
as deceased funsters.
A barest mention here last Tuesday of Hector Nicol's name has started
an avalanche of letters (two).
But accepting any invitation to polish again the boards of seaside
variety would be foolhardy. Memories of it are already vague and scarce.
Written history has skimped its attention to such follies. Any scholarly
research into them would be harder slogging than the summer show dancers
did. Besides, I may not be mature enough. Harder to resist, however, is
the soft impeachment that Hector Nicol's name was employed in order to
be more than fair to Paisley.
His wheezes against the old town must remain of good record. He knew
what he was joking about. Being a Paisley man, he had paid his dues. But
because he was a genius of such excellent whimsy may have emphasised too
brightly his town's reputation for worthy thrift.
By way of correction it could perhaps be admitted that Paisley's
meanness was not all that much more inventive, colourful, or (wrong
word) rich than, say, the narrowness of Aberdeen. Two tales to that
effect come to mind.
There was this Aberdonian who at Perth train station bought a box of
matches, the first of which would not light. ''This spunks'll nae
scart,'' he complained.
Meaning to be a help, the assistant at the station shop produced flame
by striking the match on the seat of his trousers.
''That's aa verra weel,'' said his customer. ''But gin ye think Ah'm
gyann tae come aa the wey til Perth Station ivvery time Ah need tae
scart a spunky on yeer dowp, ye hae anither think comin.''
Come to think about it, few places in the land have escaped the
suggestion that its lieges liked frugally to count their pennies. Harry
Gordon, who was in residence for a quarter-century of summers at the
Beach Pavilion, Aberdeen, accused even Edinburgh people of canniness.
He liked to allege that when a tobacco shop went on fire the capital's
finest had a job to control the crowd that collected to inhale some free
smoke. Harry Gordon also fearlessly jested about a Kirkcaldy billiards
player who when he died left his son two snookers.
Jokes about Jocks and their meanness, if not the most risible, have
been most relentless. Much heavy imagination went into them. And even
the most Scotch of comics seemed not to have wearied of telling them. It
is odd that this should be so in a nation that treasures hospitality as
a natural gift.
Moreover, the abuse appears to be of recent date. Last century started
it. Before then there were many cracks about the thickness of the Scotch
intellect and the dourness of Scotch ambition. But even the sorest
enemies -- Dr Samuel Johnson, say, or the Rev Sydney Smith -- refrained
from mirth about tightfistedness.
One theory is that cartoonists in lamented Punch magazine started up
the meanness machine, and a lot of good it has done them.
Finding out all about it sounds an agreeable summer pursuit. It would
involve a learned round of the likes of Saltcoats and Rothesay. Even
Carnoustie might be included. If no degree in social science resulted,
there might be a sun tan. Meanwhile, it may not have escaped attention
that the second of the pair of Aberdonian good wheezes has been kept up
the sleeve. It might do for a starter.

CONVICTING oneself of blind prejudice in an endeavour to enlighten
others is an act of folly which only those with more hubris than sense
would fail to recognise. Bill Smith (June 1) and Dr Alan Riach (June 5)
seem prepared to sacrifice everything and everybody to defend Hugh
McDiarmid.
Mr Smith betrays his profession and his class by referring to his
pupils as ''limited'' for their failure to appreciate MacDiarmid as
wholesomely as he does.
His pitiful comments about Shelley and Coleridge are scarcely worthy
of a reply, but his sneering abuse of McGonagall warrants an answer.
Rejected in life and treasured in death, McGonagall's name is constantly
taken in vain by zealots in search of Pyrrhic victories.
If we accept from Shelley that ''Our sweetest songs are those that
tell of saddest thought'' and believe like Keats that poetry is about a
kind of truth, only the most ungenerous of spirits would mock
McGonagall's cherishable contribution to Scottish literature.
Dr Riach disqualifies himself ''from any claim to credibility as a
literary critic'' when he writes that ''MacDiarmid was the most
important thing to happen in Scotland since 1707''.
The '15, '45, Charles Edward Stuart, Culloden, Burns, Scott,
Stevenson, two world wars, television, telephones, Denis the Menace,
rock 'n' roll, and sliced bread are, according to Dr Riach, events,
circumstances, and people with less significance than the existence of
Hugh MacDiarmid. Dr Riach is talking nonsense about the importance of
Hugh MacDiarmid.
Stating that MacDiarmid is ''better than Eliot and bigger than Pound''
is faint praise indeed. Eliot's reputation is crumbling and Pound was
exposed as a charlatan long ago.
The Dead Leibknecht is, as its title suggests, literary ideology and
confirms that MacDiarmid was a Realist. On A Raised Beach is not ''one
of the twentieth century's great verse meditations''. It is a strained
and straining piece of verse that barely manages to save itself from
falling apart.
Furthermore, the Drunk Man is not an epic poem. Epic poetry requires
an epic mind for its creation; the pale cast of MacDiarmid's thought
doesn't stretch that far. It is a repetitive and drawn-out facsimile of
Tam o' Shanter, with none of the pace and even less of the grace of
Burns's original masterpiece.
OK, let's be clear: poetry is a kind of war where only the beautiful
survive.
MacDiarmid is a refugee from a play by Moliere. He is a total impostor
who cloned himself in the image of Burns and committed the near
blasphemy of presenting himself as a Christ-like figure, crucified on a
thistle for the sake of Scotland -- an image that would be horrendous if
it wasn't so ridiculous.
He is a product of the age of impostors, when cruel tyrants imagined
they were gods and conspired to fashion the world in their own
diabolical image. Imagining he was Christ, he served the devil's
creations by plundering Scottish culture to further their despotic
designs on humanity.
MacDiarmid is a failure's failure and a triple disaster area;
literally, politically, and psychologically, he has no place to go
because no-one is enamoured of the places he has been.
The debate about MacDiarmid has moved on from the terrain that Dr
Riach is standing on. It is not about whether or not MacDiarmid is a
genius, greater than Burns or the equal of Burns, a big Pound or a
little Eliot, a major poet or a minor poet. It is about whether or not
he is a figure of ridicule.
The fifth act is now upon us, and what is to be made of all those ever
so important people who were taken in by this latter-day Tartuffe?

HAVING read Kirsty Scott's article (June 9) on the Morris Cerullo
''happening'' I cannot say I am sorry I missed it.
However, I am sorry that The Herald missed the opportunity to report
on a contrasting style of ''evangelism'' in Glasgow on the following
evening when Jim Wallis, founder of the Sojourners Movement, gave an
intelligent and inspirational address on ''The Soul of Politics'' to an
audience of several hundred in Wellington Church.

THE most catastrophic change in the Government's steady erosion of aid
for home owners is identified as the removal of the safety net for those
who lose their jobs.
The plans to curb mortgage interest benefits from October will mean
home owners have to find insurance cover to protect themselves if they
are made unemployed. It will save the Treasury #200m a year. But it has
brought warnings from mortgage lenders, charities, and politicians who
fear it will force a flood of home owners on to the streets.
At present, those who become jobless are entitled to half their
mortgage interest payments for the first 16 weeks, then the State takes
over the payments. From October they will get no help with the mortgage
for the first nine months after losing their job.
Even then, if they have savings of more than #8000, they will get no
help. There will be a sliding scale of assistance for those with more
than #3000 in savings.
Current mortgage holders would get no help for the first two months
and half the interest payments for the next four. The Government's line
is that insurance, not the State, should pick up the tab.
The trouble is, as all commentators point out, that in practice
insurance policies will not cover those most at risk of losing their
jobs. Research from the Department of Environment released last month
suggested that nine out of 10 home owners can't find satisfactory
private insurance cover. Most such policies, as the Association of
Citizens Advice Bureaux point out, contain severe exclusion clauses in
the small print.
It is, say the critics, a way of dodging responsibility for a
Government which first encouraged people on to the housing ladder and
now pulls away the safety net. And it is the culmination of three years
of Treasury savings which have hit home owners hard.
First came the reduction in tax relief on mortgage interest (Miras) in
1992 -- which was costing the Treasury then around #8000m a year.
So in the 1993 Budget top-rate taxpayers were restricted to a standard
rate of 25%. The following year, a further 5% was lopped off, and this
has been cut further to 15%. There have been hints that the Government
may consider totally phasing out Miras, which will cost the Treasury
#3000m this year, to promote a one-off tax incentive for new buyers.
It is estimated that Scottish home owners will face average increases
of 11.8% in repayments, once the Miras cuts and the cost of mortgage
insurance are added up.
Professor Peter Kemp, Rowntree Professor of Housing at York, believes
the changes to mortgage protection make no sense at all: ''It is pulling
the rug out from the bottom of the housing market in a way that seems
difficult to justify.''
Kenneth Gibb of Glasgow University adds: ''People are now experiencing
the costs of being home owners.''
Willie Munro, of the Scottish Building Society, is similarly blunt:
''The biggest psychological problem for home owners is the curtailment
of income support. It is quite reckless of the Government to suggest
mortgage income support can be replaced with private insurance. They
have not analysed it.''
Peter Williams, of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said the big
problem for home owners had been the rapid change from a high-inflation
to a low-inflation housing market with all the consequences felt by
those trapped in homes they cannot sell.
''The changes the Government has been pushing through are not
sensitive to that. Reducing tax relief, changing the income support
regulations . . . over the past two or three years the Government has
made a lot of changes, all of which have taken assistance away from home
owners.
''One of our views is that the Government is trying to do too many
things too quickly and they should go for a period of stability to let
the market regain its confidence.''
His organisation wants some help for first-time buyers, such as
restoring tax relief for those coming into the market. It wants a U-turn
also on mortgage protection.
''In essence, what the Government's policy is doing is driving the
market further down. It was going down anyway. It has succeeded in
taking confidence even lower.''
Kenneth Gibb says there is a misconception that Major's Cabinet have a
cohesive housing policy: ''I don't think it has at all. They (Ministers)
promote home ownership, yet reduce its benefits by cutting mortgage tax
relief and the safety net of mortgage interest relief for the
unemployed. There is no coherence in what they are doing.''
Labour's UK housing spokesman, Nick Raynsford, says Ministers appear
to be in a time-warp, fearful of a lurch back into the boom-bust cycles
of the past: ''They are so busy fighting yesterday's battles that they
have failed to notice how the world has moved. Economic circumstances
are light years away from those which applied in the late eighties boom.
A reversal of policy is urgently needed to restore confidence in the
market and rescue the millions of home owners strapped in debt without
hope of support.''
A clue to the Government's thoughts for the future came recently from
English Housing Minister David Curry. The private-rented sector, he
said, would be to the nineties what home ownership was to the eighties.
Full details of initiatives would have to wait for a White Paper to be
issued later this month, but he claimed that new institutional
investment and more deregulation of the rented sector was now needed.
Deregulation: now there's a word that brings back memories. Sceptical
commentators point out that it was the deregulation of the financial
markets, in the eighties, that brought a flood of money into the
mortgage market which fuelled the housing boom.
David Smith, of the Association of Building Societies, believes the
eighties' deregulation and the arrival of the centralised lenders was
the main factor behind the massive increase in English home owners with
negative equity: ''There was a belief among those lenders, who borrowed
money on the money markets to lend on, that sales price inflation would
always bale them out, on the basis that even if the lending decision was
bad, they could repossess. By the time they repossessed, house price
inflation would have pushed up the price of the property to allow them
to get out without loss.
''That was the ideology behind it. When the bubble burst those lenders
got out. Repossession went through the roof in England. While it went up
in Scotland, I believe it was mainly for reasons we have always
experienced -- unemployment rather than mad borrowing. We have learned
to be more cautious through hard experience.''

THE second anniversary of Nigeria's botched return to civil rule via
free elections seems to have passed off without riots and killings. It
did not pass without incident however, particularly in Lagos, the
country's largest city, where large numbers of people simply did not
turn up for work. The opposition alliance which recommended this course
did not want a repetition of last year's incidents when many people were
killed. The military government did not want a repetition either had
already acted in an intimidatory manner to ensure quiesence. Both sides
may therefore claim a degree of success, though the fact is that the
military regime remains deeply unpopular, particularly in south-western
Nigeria, the old Yorubaland, which has some claim to be the most
sophisticated as well as the most developed part of the country. It was
in Yorubaland that Moshood Abiola, who almost certainly won the 1993
presidential elections, achieved his greatest following, though he did
well across the whole south of the country, if less so in the central
and northern regions.
The precise outcome of that election will probably never be known
though most foreign observers were satisfied that Abiola had won. The
military government, then in the person of General Babangida, ruled
otherwise and plunged the country into political chaos by annulling the
elections before all the results were declared. Later Babangida did try
to hand over power to a civil administration headed by his own,
unelected, nominee, only to find three months later that his military
colleagues preferred to retain power. The Army produced its own ruler,
General Abacha, who promised, as Babangida had done. an eventual return
to civil rule. The Nigerian Army has become too used to government: of
the 35 years since the country's independence from British rule in 1960
military governments have held sway for 25. Indeed the most serious
threat to General Abacha seems to have come from an alleged military
plot to mount another coup this spring. The trial of some of the accused
is proceeding at the moment -- they include General Obasanjo, a
distinguished military ruler himself.
It is no longer clear that General Abacha even pretends to desire a
return to civil government, for he proclaimed a period of indefinite
personal rule in April, though that may have been a reaction to the
military plot uncovered the previous month. Worse, he is systematically
undermining the country's free press by closing critical journals. The
Nigerian press was one of the glories of sub-Saharan Africa, proving
itself to be lively, irreverent, and irrepressible even in the colonial
age. It is sad to see attempts to cow it as well as to force into exile
some of the country's most talented intellectual and creative figures.
Nigeria is a huge but poor country with enormous economic promise but
desperate political problems because of competing ethnic identities. Its
armed forces intervened politically initially for good reasons but have
found it almost impossible to disengage. In remaining in office (without
the benefit of any popular legitimacy) its officers have lost their own
professional distinction and competence, and become dictatorial
oligarchs; possibly, in the shape of General Abacha, straightforward
dictators. In the absence of free elections, it is no surprise that
other officers conspire to seize power by force. Even an element of
political corruption is preferable to perpetual dictatorship. Few
believed that President Abiola's election was absolutely genuine and
above board everywhere but it mostly was, and was popularly accepted.
His imprisonment is a travesty of justice; his trial for treason would
be a bad joke. Yesterday's mass stay-at-home showed good sense, though
soldiers will interpret it as fear.

* PAUL MUGNAIONI quit his job as director of housing in Glasgow
because he saw a gap in the market for quality housing for rent.
At a time when home ownership was booming it seemed an odd move to set
up Quality Street which offered good-class rented homes for the upwardly
mobile.
But Mugnaioni (pictured left at Quality Street's Fountainside
development in Hamilton) says he spied structural changes in the housing
market in the offing, encouraged by the experience of other countries.
He says: ''What's been happening for the past 10 years is a structural
change in the housing market. Two generations ago nearly everyone in the
UK rented their homes.''
In the eighties, he suggests, the housing market swung too far in the
direction of owner occupation.
But now, he says, the rented sector is flourishing, and has been
growing since the Government's Business Expansion Scheme gave investors
in private rental property tax-breaks.
Mugnaioni claims the changing nature of work, with more short-term
contracts and greater mobility, means that people are opting for rental
to avoid the costs of selling and buying as they move in pursuit of
work.
He says: ''Quality Street has something like 4500 homes for rent now,
of which it owns 2500. It has properties in Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth,
Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Something like 60% of its portfolio is south of
the Border.''

ACCORDING to defence chiefs, Britain is committed to developing a
sophisticated defence shield against missile attack from countries such
as Libya, Iraq, and Iran, which it considers to have unstable regimes.
Concern has increased in recent years over the proliferation of
ballistic missile technology in such states and, although potential
enemies will not have the weapons to threaten mainland Britain until the
middle of the next decade, its forces deployed around the world could be
at risk much sooner.
Defence experts are looking at both static and mobile defence systems
that could even be fitted to the latest warships.
Researchers are already working on the use of the British-designed
Mesar, the world's most advanced long-range radar, to track missiles.
The US is interested in the research programme and is likely to form
part of Britain's contribution to a US/European collaborative ballistic
missile defence project.
''We have a unique ability in this,'' said Defence Procurement
Minister Roger Freeman. ''Mesar can be used to track missiles at
tremendous range and with great accuracy.''
The radar is earmarked for the Royal Navy's new air defence frigates,
due to enter service early next century.
There is also informed speculation that they could carry a system
similar to the Patriot that destroyed Iraqi Scuds during the Gulf War,
or the new American long-range Thaad.
US studies recently proved that Thaad could be used at sea to provide
a highly flexible, area-wide defence against ballistic missile attack.
However, Mr Freeman acknowledged that the huge cost of developing and
purchasing a viable shield against ballistic missile attack meant
Britain could not go it alone.
''For economic and political reasons, we realise we will have to
collaborate with Europe under the aegis of Nato,'' he said.
Mr Freeman stressed that ''something had to be done'' to combat the
future threat to Britain and its forces, which were deployed
increasingly overseas, largely on humanitarian missions.
''We have to be aware that within a decade we will be faced with the
prospect of ballistic and cruise missiles, from countries we don't see
as stable or friendly, reaching this country,'' he said.

PETER KENNEDY (June 5) gave fairly accurate appraisals of certain
characters from the American Civil War, or the War Between the States as
it is very often and, I believe, more accurately known.
However, he did use one phrase which was so poorly worded as to merit
rectification: ''Robert E Lee, perhaps a decent man, fighting for a
thoroughly nasty cause.''
First, let us look at the man. Robert E Lee was one of the most
honest, courteous, and compassionate men you could ever hope to have
met. Humble in victory and dignified in defeat, he was a very religious
man who loved greatly his wife and family. In the words of author James
MacPherson, he was ''the very epitome of the Christian gentleman''.
His love extended beyond just his family -- it reached out and touched
his soldiers as well, and they adored him. Few leaders in history have
been able to induce such devotion in people. Their faith in him was
unquestioning and their loyalty to him was absolute -- to the point of
death.
Add to these attributes the fact that he is universally acknowledged
as one of the most gifted and resourceful field commanders in military
history, then we come much closer to a proper picture of the man.
Therefore to describe Lee as ''perhaps a decent man'' shows that Peter
Kennedy must have a born talent for understatement.
Secondly let us look at the ''thoroughly nasty cause'' -- slavery.
However, Robert E Lee was an outspoken disbeliever in slavery. Indeed,
in the middle of the war, he freed all the slaves he inherited from his
late father-in-law's estate.
Lee fought, as did all other Confederate soldiers, not to keep other
human beings in bondage but to achieve Southern independence which was
both the Confederate war aim and the matter which sparked off the
conflict in the first place.

FATHER'S DAY.
WE'VE had the question, in general terms, for some time. Now our
eight-year-old daughter is getting a bit more specific. With my wife
putting in some long hours recently to meet a deadline, I'm here alone
and being faced with rather pointed inquiries.
Eight-year-old's reasoning has worked out: mummy's tummy is this big,
and a baby is that big. That explains why pregnant women have a bulge.
But, she realises, the point of exit (as yet unspecified) would also
have to be sized to suit. You can see the look of ''you must be joking''
developing in her eyes.
Behind the comedy there is a real dilemma. Do I avoid the issue (sorry
about the pun) and leave it for Mum to deal with, risking setting up
barriers and phobias because it's ''too difficult'' for me? Or do I
welly in with gynaecology for beginners, and risk getting some of it
wrong? I'm still not sure what part the stork plays. Should a dad get
involved in discussions about women's rude bits?
So far we have tried to keep nearer to the ''open'' end of the
spectrum in all our relationships with the children. While in the past
it was only a case of hiding under a table in a restaurant when small
child corrects little friend at top of voice ''it's not a willy it's a .
. . '', we are now at the point where they expect answers -- real ones
-- to hard questions. Should we start dissembling at this late stage?
No, I don't think so either. And giving her a book and telling her to go
away and read it, come back if you have any questions, is a cop-out.
Dangerous too.
So, given this is meant to be a partnership, we will share the duty of
being honest, unsensational and hopefully not coy. When our daughter
asks -- it's up to her to set the pace -- I'll start off with the
generalities, and my wife will no doubt get involved in the particular.
We'll probably find our six-year-old already knows it all and is
correcting us along the way.
Next, I suppose, will come ''How are babies made?'' Friends got this
question from their youngest at the breakfast table one weekend. The
elder brother did the job for them, in graphic detail and, shall we say,
colloquial language. ''Oh,'' says the youngest, ''I thought they were
just having bumpy cuddles.'' End of all attempts at seriousness from
parents.
We never had this problem when I was a lad, but that was the best part
of 40 years ago. I never even thought to ask such questions, least of
all of my parents. I blame it all on the school. If they didn't teach
logic so successfully, and stuck to good old sums rather than doing
three dimensional shapes and sizes, we may have had a few more years of
ducking these issues -- until they were at uni, perhaps.
As for me, I still avoid gooseberry bushes like the plague.

Maternal ambivilance is the theory that feelings of love and hate for
children exist side-by-side in all mothers. Joan McFadden reports on the
controversial concept.
ROZSIKA Parker believes conflicting emotions of love and hate for a
child can actually have a creative impact, stimulating and sharpening a
mother's awareness of what is going on between her and her child.
Maternal ambivalence, as she describes it, is the experience shared
variously by all mothers, in which loving and hating feelings for their
children exist side-by-side. It is a concept which makes many uneasy,
and is often categorically denied as existing in the ''normal'' mother.
There is general acceptance of contrasting emotions towards a child's
behaviour, but targeting the child itself, or its personality, arouses
concern.
Parker, as a psycho-analyst and psychotherapist, unequivocally accepts
the concept of maternal ambivalence. It is a fascinating subject which
is not easy to discuss without resorting to sweeping generalisations. It
is true that when a mother and child recollect their relationship, two
separate narratives emerge, to the extent that it can be difficult to
believe that the same relationship is being described. Professionally,
maternal ambivalence has been traditionally understood from the child's
point of view. This book gives priority to the mother's perspective.
Personal and cultural pressures often produce anxiety and guilt which
mothers are unable to shake off. There is a constant image of the
perfect mother to live up to, which was daunting enough when motherhood
was a woman's only career. Time and again women refer to guilt as the
prevailing emotion while they struggle to juggle career and family and
worry that they are coping effectively with neither.
The situation might change, but the emotions remain constant. Whether
working full-time, part-time, or concentrating entirely on raising her
family, a woman can feel guilty. While some of this anxiety can be
blamed on stereotyping and factors such as media pressure, much of it
must be accepted as inherent in motherhood. The most hard-headed,
cynical career woman can be left shaking and undermined by the rush of
emotions generated by giving birth. Men have similar experiences, but
again cultural expectations temper their passions, while women's are
expected and in many cases exploited.
Torn In Two provides an enlightening mirror, and as such a reassurance
for many beset by the constant pressures of motherhood. There is a
tendency for women to castigate themselves for any deviation from the
perfect-mother image, and much of the value in this book lies in
Parker's clarity while relating incidents and emotions from other
women's lives.
Mothers constantly worry of danger or harm coming to their child, but
they must recognise that irritation or anger with that same precious
child is not just normal, but a necessary part of development.
A child is given the right to develop and express their feelings, and
a mother should give herself the same rights. The mother/child
relationship will stultify if the child cannot learn to express itself
by imitating its closest influence.
The right to be angry is something mothers may find difficult to
demand, but they are not alone. Parker urges women to look at what they
want for themselves, as well as for their children.
The overall impact of this book both troubles and pacifies, raising
more questions about the art of motherhood than it provides answers.

Day Two of a Herald investigation examines why your home is no longer
an
investment. Margaret Vaughan reports
THE glow may have gone but the great love affair with home ownership
continues. The difference now, say the experts, is that the one-night
stand must evolve into a more lasting relationship, viewed with a more
realistic eye.
''People will probably always want to buy -- eventually,'' says
Professor Peter Kemp, Rowntree Professor of Housing at York University.
''It offers attractions apart from the idea of investment. If people
see home ownership as a way of providing somewhere to live rather than a
sure way of making money, that is a good thing. Viewing your home as a
profit centre is unhealthy. If the structural changes in the property
market make people wary of buying a home for that reason, so much the
better.''
Like many other housing academics he believes a structural change in
the housing market is under way. Low inflation is the key.
''Why should you expect to profit from something you've bought
anyway?'' asks Douglas Robertson, of Stirling University's Housing
Policy and Practice Unit.
Whether the demand for owner occupation will be the same in the future
if people realise they are not going to make a capital gain from it is,
he says, a moot point: ''I'm not sure what the full repercussions are.
Maybe people will begin to look on housing more as a consumer product
rather than an investment. Why should you in reality make a profit from
something you have bought? Once that's withdrawn, perhaps it's more
realistic that house prices don't inflate.''
If house prices remain stable, he says, people's disposable income
increases. They have more to spend on other goods, perhaps putting much
more money into maintenance.
''The trend has been to move in and get out quickly before it falls
apart. Maybe that will change. And that could be beneficial for a whole
number of businesses and companies and for the general economy, if
people have more money to spend.''
There are benefits in a fixed period of stable house prices, he
argues. While a number of people benefited from the boom, it is
questionable whether it was worth the painful cost to others.
These structural changes in home ownership, if inflation is conquered,
will mean people coming into the housing market later and seeing houses,
simply, as somewhere to live, says chief economist at Midland Montagu,
Roger Bootle: ''This will tend to reduce both turnover and prices as
people no longer trade up for financial gain.''
Moira Munro, who is deputy director of the Centre for Housing Research
at Glasgow University, has been looking at forecasts on housing. She
does not believe the market will begin to pick up for some time yet:
''One of the strong long-term relationships is that house prices are
related to real incomes. Our research tends to show that we are looking
at prices recovering towards the end of the century. There may be a
continued dip and a modest recovery with the market starting to pick up
in 1996/97.''
But she believes that the Government's plan to pull away the safety
net of mortgage interest relief for those who lose their jobs combined
with the growing use of short-term contracts and cuts in mortgage tax
relief will combine to deter many people from risking a mortgage.
''I'm not surprised confidence is dented. In the short run people may
not be quite so keen to take the risk of borrowing to buy a house.
People are vulnerable.
''And I think there is no doubt a lot of people have lost out. Those
with big mortgage arrears, they feel cheated. They were persuaded that
if they bought they couldn't lose, that it was a step that people ought
to take.''
Her colleague in the department, Kenneth Gibb, says the housing market
is extremely volatile and predictions of how it will go have dubious
value: ''One important factor is how the mortgage market develops and
that is difficult to anticipate because of the changes to mortgage
interest income support planned for October.''
Mr Gibb's research has convinced him that the idea of home owners
being expected to take out private insurance in case they lose their job
will be disastrous. Those most at risk will find it impossible to get
cover: ''I think there is a real problem. There does seem to be a
perception that owner occupation isn't a safe investment any more. I'm
not clear if that is temporary or permanent, or what it means for the
housing market.
''Right now, there is very little choice, and while that remains the
case people will find themselves buying houses.''
David Smith, a Scottish spokesman for the Building Societies
Association, argues that the changing nature of employment and the
growing increase in short-term contracts will have a profound effect on
housing: ''I suspect contract working will be a permanent feature of the
way we drive to compete with the world at large. In which case, those in
contract employment will think long and hard before committing
themselves to mortgage debts to be paid. This, to my mind, would be a
potential factor in eliminating the growth of the owner-occupation
market in Scotland.''
But Peter Williams, of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, believes there
is still a gap in the housing market in Scotland: ''I think there is
still the capacity for growth. The lenders, though, will have to respond
to the changes in the labour market. It is in their interests, after
all. Because people work on contracts doesn't necessarily mean they
can't sustain a mortgage. Lenders will have to recognise that they will
have a sequence of contracts rather than a job. It doesn't mean they are
not eligible for a loan. You simply make the assessment for the loan
more carefully.''
Willie Munro, of the Scottish Building Society, feels houses will no
longer be the hedge against inflation they once were, but will still be
a safe investment. ''They may not appreciate compared with what they
used to do. Certainly in Scotland, I can't see houses losing ground and
many people will continue to look to buying a house rather than renting.
''It is no longer right, and hasn't been for a long time now, that
houses are a good investment. They are a sound investment.''

ROME: Two earth tremors shook Rome last night, sending thousands of
people into the streets and rattling furniture and lamps from the
historic centre to the Mediterranean shore. There were no reports of
injuries or serious damage.
The strongest of the two tremors measured 3.9 on the Richter scale,
the National Geophysics Institute said. The epicentres of both tremors
were in different areas south of the capital.

BRUSSELS: Surgeon Pedro Brugada collapsed with a heart attack during a
Belgian golf tournament, made a dramatic recovery and went on to win,
the Belga news agency said yesterday. His heart stopped for about half a
minute until he was revived by another player, an anaesthetist, who gave
him heart massage. He was rushed to hospital, but 90 minutes later was
back on the course.

IF you want to get to work on time -- get on your bike.
Pedal power was the winner of a commuter challenge during the rush
hour in Glasgow yesterday. A bicycle, car, train, and bus were compared
for travel times and the bicycle came out best.
Members of the Glasgow Cycling Campaign left Newton Mearns in the
south of Glasgow at 8.20am and travelled to George Square by bicycle,
car, train, and bus.
Mr Neil McDonald, the group's vice-convener, completed the seven mile
journey by bicycle in 30 minutes, following the A77 into the city centre
and arriving in George Square at 8.50am.
Colleague Bevis Teush, driving a Citroen car, took 47 minutes
following a similar route, arriving at 9.07am -- 17 minutes later than
the cyclist. Both he and Mr McDonald said they obeyed the Highway Code
and did not run any red traffic lights.
Two members who travelled by train took 48 minutes. They left from the
same start point at the same time as the other ''commuters'' and took a
bus to Whitecraigs railway station before boarding the 8.34am train to
Glasgow Central. They arrived in George Square at 9.08am.
Another two took a bus which left two minutes later than the scheduled
8.23am departure time and arrived in George Square at 9.28am. Their
journey had taken almost one hour and 10 minutes.
The campaigners chose the route because part of it is parallel to a
controversial section of the M77 under construction. Planners claim the
new stretch will reduce vehicle journey times by an average of seven
minutes.
Mr McDonald said the result showed that the fastest way to travel into
a city was by bicycle and emphasised the journey time was repeatable
because it would take the same time regardless of traffic conditions.
He added: ''The M77 extension is partially justified by its predicted
time-saving for cars but if the bicycle beats the car by 17 minutes
there is now even less justification for this destructive road.
''And, if just 15% of car commuters cycled to and from work, air
quality and the health of commuters would dramatically improve.''
Mr McDonald said the train journey was also fast and efficient, adding
that railways should be used more often and in conjunction with the
bicycle.
Mr Teush, who admitted he was fortunate to find a parking space in
George Square quickly, said: ''There is no way I would want to spend 47
minutes driving into work every morning. If I was trying to get in for a
9am meeting I would have been late.''
Mr William Jess, one of those who travelled by bus, said its
disappointing performance was because it was caught in traffic jams
caused by cars with just one person in them.
The group promotes cycling and other forms of environmentally-friendly
transport and says that although there is insufficient provision for
cyclists with features such as cycle lanes, there is at least
recognition among some local authorities that more is needed.
The event coincided with the start of the Hovis National Bike Week.
Strathclyde Regional Council is also to launch a poster campaign
tomorrow, ironically on the back end of buses, to promote cycling and
walking.
People in Dundee were also urged to cycle yesterday as part of a
campaign to clean up the city. The Don't Choke the City campaign aims to
persuade commuters to abandon their cars in favour of two-wheeled
transport.
In 1980, five million vehicles used the Tay Road Bridge, now the
figure is more than seven million.

AS a book-selling aid Mr John Major is not immediately impressive.
Knocking him about is such an ingrained habit in modern politics that
more excitement, indeed astonishment, would result from someone bathing
him soothingly in genuine praise. It depends, of course, who is doing
the knocking. A frisson of excitement is always caused by a mugging
within the family and there is nobody more adept at it than Mrs
Thatcher. Her assault on Mr Major over recent weekends and again
yesterday has been a vigorous affair; somehow she draws new breath and
strength from the prospect of political violence. The purpose of it all
is less clear. It is not too cynical to see in it at least an element of
book marketing. The launch of the second volume of her memoirs has been
handled with the precision and relentlessness of a military campaign.
First there was the threat of punitive action against the hapless Prime
Minister. Then came the softening up of the newspaper excerpts, similar
in effect to a long-range artillery bombardment. By yesterday morning
the marines had landed and Mrs Thatcher was where she best likes to be,
at the centre of the action signing books, coining phrases, and making a
good deal of money out of it all.
If the book trade's forecasts of huge sales of the book are fulfilled,
what else does Mrs Thatcher expect from the affair? She left the House
of Commons because she did not want to be seen as looking over anyone's
shoulder. That was noble if true, but remains basically unbelievable.
Now she does not so much look over John Major's shoulders as hang on
them like an albatross. Her criticisms of Mr Major's actions and
policies are comprehensive. She believes his European policy to be
hopelessly weak and wrong and much the same applies to his policies on
housing, the family, relations with the United States, and the treatment
of the Euro rebels. Somehow he is not conservative enough. It is wise to
write this with a lower-case initial letter because Mrs Thatcher has no
more claim to authentic Conservatism than Mr Major. Seen in the context
of the long history of this respected doctrine she is at least an
interloper and may yet be seen as a destroyer. The essence of her
intervention in recent days is concerned as much with self-justification
as with an earnest desire to bend Mr Major back on to the path of true
Thatcherite righteousness.
Her virtual disowning yesterday of the policy of her own Government to
join the ERM is a case in point. She was the Prime Minister, yet she
says she joined the ERM because she was the only person in Cabinet
resisting it and because Mr Major wanted to join. Thus we have the
vision of a Prime Minister bending to the will of her colleagues on a
major issue and doing something which she believes passionately to be
wrong. A Euro-sceptic Tory MP had the sense to point out yesterday that
she was the person who steered the Government into the Single European
Act, but that will be dismissed as revisionism or treachery or both.
Really, there is no winning with Mrs Thatcher. She is the ultimate
spoiled brat who cannot admit the blame for anything. She may, or may
not, be right in her essential analysis of Mr Major's abilities but at
least he has dignity. Now he must draw on this quality to face the
renewed attacks of right and left. The war over Mr Major has begun in
earnest: it will either be to catch his ear or cut his throat.

Views on motherhood, and the working woman, have changed dramatically
throughout this century. A new book, as Jo Hall discovers, proves that
despite differing opinions, mothers of all generations share a common
link through the joys and trials of giving birth and parenting.
''We married when I was 27 and we had our first child the following
year. I considered a family as the natural and desirable result of
married life'' -- Patricia Rogers, born 1909.
''At 18 and single, having a baby was what I wanted. I was idealistic
and very much into being a woman and I saw it as a very feminine thing I
wanted to experience.'' -- Rachel Lockey, born 1967.
THESE are just two of the many views which define motherhood in Vivien
Devlin's new book, Motherhood From 1920 To The Present Day. ''Obviously
I wanted to get from the youngest mother to the oldest I could find.
It's all primary source, so the youngest girl was 14 and my eldest was
93 . . . she had her babies in the 1920s.''
In order to find interviewees for this oral history, Devlin had to
have a cross-section of class, age and regions. This was achieved by
placing adverts in various magazines and newspapers, everything from the
Guardian to the Midwife's Chronicle.
''I was astounded with the response,'' enthuses Devlin. ''Within a
week the postcards, the letters, the essays arrived. A woman from
Argyll, my oldest woman in the book, called Violet Hamilton Stevenson,
wrote a three to four page essay. She's a widow and now her family has
left home, but she has strong feelings about how motherhood has changed,
how she brought up her children, and how she views mothers today.''
''My father felt, as his entire generation did, that marriage was the
future for a young woman, but he was quite prepared for me to have an
art school education or anything else I fancied, while I was growing up
and getting ready for matrimony.'' (Violet Hamilton Stevenson, born
1902)
''I don't approve of all these single women having babies. A child
needs a father. I really do think so.'' (May Stephen, born 1911)
These initial letters were followed up by long detailed questionnaires
and a whittling down process which ended up with more than 80
face-to-face interviews ''I didn't want it to be a story of the most
tragic tales. However, a lot of the women who wrote to me often did have
an extraordinary tale to tell.''
''I had five babies within five years, all born in -- or almost in --
hospital. The first three were fairly hi-tech, constantly monitored
births and I was given an epidural for all of them . . . I think my body
was getting used to this annual labour, and he was born in the front
seat of our Ford Escort en-route to hospital!'' (Ailsa Gray, born 1953.)
''I don't remember being very health conscious or worried about my
diet and so on. I didn't smoke and I didn't drink. I remember it was
Christmas time and so had the odd glass of wine. I walked everywhere
because my husband and I never had a car, and I have always been
healthy. It was a very lucky pregnancy. I never felt any different. I
felt the baby move around, but that was it. I never had any heartburn .
. . very unremarkable pregnancy on the whole.'' (Winifred Fyfe)
The women who contributed did so in a very frank and open way,
according to Devlin. ''I felt like an agony aunt a lot of the time,''
she said. ''A lot of the time women who talked of divorce . . . the pain
of divorce, why were they wanting to talk to me? The little advert in
the papers and magazines seemed to spark something off in these women.
They wanted to share something . . . a common experience.''
However, with so many stories and so many differing experiences, can
Vivien be sure she has captured the full picture? ''I think in this book
there is every kind of experience, tragic tales of long labours. The
struggles of bringing the children up, women who have had handicapped
children, women who suffered with post-natal depression . . . one woman
talked of the joy of looking at her toddler in his wellies. How it is
all worthwhile. Every aspect of the experience and the emotion . . . in
terms of being a mother from the 1920s to the 1990s.
''Well, you would be amazed what some of these young pregnant girls
had for breakfast -- a pork pie, half a packet of crisps, a cup of tea
and three biscuits. It is quite rare to find a girl who has a bowl of
cereal and a slice of toast . . .'' (Carol Walton, trained as midwife
1966-67.)
''Today I hear mothers asking their children what would they like to
eat! My children had two choices, take it or leave it.'' (Margaret
Cruikshank, born 1933.)
A book scanning such a time period is bound to reflect social change,
and never was there a greater time of social change in terms of women's
lives. This book includes accounts of what it's like to work in service
below stairs right to the present day and the emergence of the ''new
man'' and with him ''the new father''.
In terms of motherhood there are several huge upheavals. ''Women
working is the biggest change. Women have always worked and you can't
always say that women gave up work with marriage, but there were a lot
of restrictions. Even the working class in the 1920s when women had to
work, they could bring work into the house or they might do washing.
People talk about that but since the sixties and seventies it's not just
a part-time job, women want a full-time job, and they want to use their
education.
''They want to work so they delay having a family for a start. Then
immediately after the birth they go back to work following maternity
leave. Whereas older women had to give up their work as there was a
marriage bar. In professions like the law, the civil service, teaching,
and the BBC, you had to leave your job when you got married, not when
you had children. The woman's role was as a mother, you stayed at home
and had your children.''
''I was a very shy, ignorant and innocent young woman. I didn't know
anything about anything. The only pleasure in life was going to the
pictures. That was my one and only pleasure, to see the romantic scenes.
But the romantic scenes were always at the end of the story, the happy
ending. That was your role model. In the films you saw how things would
happen between men and women. That kiss was the end of the story.''
(Ethel Hay, born 1914.)
''The other big change is contraception. There is a lot in the book
about family planning and the ignorance of the older women, who were
ignorant on their wedding night. Contraception wasn't talked about
between a married couple because it was just so embarrassing. From the
sixties, with the pill, that gave women a chance to control their
fertility.
''Women are starting their families later, too, and it seems by the
year 2000 that 40% of women will be over 30 by the time they have their
first child. Another major change for the mother is the way she looks at
her job and lifestyle. According to Devlin: ''The older women say
motherhood was a career and now it is seen as a career break.''
''I would be too lazy to have it all! I can't think how they do it.
But I remember asking my second daughter if she really needed to work
and she said she couldn't bear being at home with the children all the
time.'' (Margaret Dixon, born 1905.)
The real-life stories in the book are intermingled with extracts from
literary sources about being a mother and views of motherhood. Devlin
herself is married without children, a committed career woman. She feels
this put her in a position where she could stand outside and objectively
speak to all these mothers.
With this insight, can she pinpoint when the best time was to be a
mother . . . ''When talking to women, people who had their babies in the
fifties maybe if they were comfortably off. There is a woman who has six
children and she talked of the bliss of life. Of the husband off to work
and lots of middle-class people and working-class, too, were able to
survive off one salary.
''Needs weren't so much. People didn't have cars, computers, videos.
People didn't buy so much, they lived quietly at home. It was cheaper to
live . . . the thirties, the fifties were good times if the woman was
happy to stay at home . . . of course, there are a lot of happy women
today but they are juggling a lot of things, there is a lot of pressure
and financial problems.''
* Motherhood From 1920 To The Present Day, will be published by
Polygon at the end of July. A four-part radio documentary series on
Women and Motherhood will be produced by Viven Devlin for BBC Scotland
in the autumn this year.

DAVE ALEXANDER, a housing researcher working with the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations, believes we may have reached the
limits of home ownership in Scotland.
''If you look at rates of home ownership in the most prosperous
European countries -- Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark --
you will find a more balanced view.
''They have a high provision of rental housing. And they have escaped
the dogma associated with home ownership. People should be able to
choose the kind of housing they want to suit their needs and their
economic situation.
''The limits to home ownership are becoming apparent. The result of
people unable to pay their mortgages, those whose houses have fallen
into disrepair are signs of where the limits of home ownership have been
pushed too far.
''After 15 years of plugging home ownership, rather than a balanced
view of housing policy, we need a radical rethink.''
His radical solutions favour a variety of housing options, with people
able to choose rented housing according to their needs: ''We need a
flexible housing system for people who can change tenure without moving
house. They can switch from being owner occupier to being renters, on
the model called shared ownership.''
This might allow people to take part ownership and pay part rent,
changing their share as their circumstances allow.
Scottish Homes, the Government's housing agency in Scotland, is
currently operating a number of schemes along similar lines but,
according to Alexander, it is hamstrung by the Government's fixation
with pushing home ownership.
Our European neighbours seem much less smitten by the house-buying bug
than the UK. The evidence is that they wait longer before buying their
first home, often well into their thirties. The same is true of the US
and Canada.
In other European countries where renting a flat is more widely
accepted as making economic sense, there are more favourable tax regimes
to provide incentives to private landlords.
However Kenneth Gibb, housing researcher at Glasgow University, argues
that change to renting is slow and that housing options remain narrow:
''You really have to damage the owner-occupier before people will
contemplate renting. Once people get into the ownership culture, it's
difficult to change.
''People have to see a wider choice and see the benefit of a wider
choice and there has to be far more information about these choices.''
Douglas Robertson at Stirling University believes the incentives do
not exist to attract investors into providing private rented
accommodation.
''The argument hasn't changed since the turn of the century. Private
renting is not a good place to invest your money. There are better
returns from other areas,'' argues Robertson.

<HEADLINE>Head faces disciplinary hearing after admitting sticky tape assault on 10-year-old pupil Teacher who gagged boy is fined #350</HEADLINE>

A HEAD teacher who gagged a chatterbox pupil by wrapping sticky tape
around his mouth was fined #350 yesterday.
Alex Christie, 46, pleaded guilty at Falkirk Sheriff Court to
assaulting a 10-year-old boy in the classroom of a primary school in the
Falkirk area.
Last night, Central Regional Council said there would be a
disciplinary hearing into the case of Mr Christie, who has been
suspended since the incident in February.
The court heard that the teacher taped the boy's mouth as a way of
''reprimanding with humour'' after he kept talking instead of getting on
with his work. However, depute procurator-fiscal Sarah Livingstone said
the joke went too far and the boy was humiliated in front of his
friends.
She said: ''Mr Christie was taking the class because the normal
teacher was at a funeral. The boy had been shouting out answers in
response to various work in the classroom.
''Mr Christie beckoned the boy out with his finger. He put Sellotape
around the child's mouth. It didn't completely cover the boy's mouth or
nose but the boy had difficulty breathing.''
The fiscal said the boy later told police he was beginning to cry
because he was humiliated. ''He felt uncomfortable in front of the
class, who were laughing at him.''
The boy said the headmaster threatened to use stronger tape if he
misbehaved again. After five to 10 minutes, he helped the boy remove the
tape.
The fiscal said the boy was so upset that he went to his granny's
house during the school's mid-morning break.
In a statement to police, Christie, head of the school for 12 years,
said he had done it as a joke: ''The child was amused by it.''
His statement added that the boy's mother had been involved in several
incidents at the school gates and he claimed that he had had to call the
community police officer.
Christie claimed the gagging incident was reported to police because
the ''mother was out for revenge''.
Christie's solictor, Mr Stewart Neilson, said the boy's class had a
record of disruption. He added: ''It was very difficult, from a
disciplinary point of view. The boy was one of several known for talking
out of turn when they should be working.''
Mr Neilson added that Christie acted on the spur of the moment. ''His
purpose was not to harm the child. He was not trying to be malicious. He
was trying to bring it home to the child, in a light-hearted manner.''
The lawyer said Christie deeply regretted his actions. ''It was
foolish and wrong. He had no intention of causing any suffering, harm or
distress to the child.''
Sheriff David Crow told Christie that he was in a privileged position
-- looking after pupils in the absence of their parents. He noted that
the teacher had an ''excellent and unblemished record''.
He added: ''I accept that this whole tragic incident started as a
joke. But you will realise in the cold light of day that you then sent
the boy back to his chair and it took you a length of time to realise
that it had passed beyond a joke.''
The sheriff added: ''Any penalty I may impose would be relatively
insignificant, compared to the damage which will be done to your own
professional career. You have fallen from the very high standards that
you have set.''
After the hearing, Mr Christie, who is suspended on full pay, said he
was unable to comment because he did not want to prejudice any possible
disciplinary hearing by Central Regional Council.
The boy's father said: ''We just want that teacher out of our son's
school. We want our son to be able to get on with his schooling and his
life.
''When the story first came out, he became the target of taunts from
the other kids who shouted at him: 'Look! There's the Sellotape Kid!'
Our family just want to forget this whole affair.''
Last night, Mr Brian Hutchison, Central region's head of education
personnel services, said: ''Mr Christie has been suspended since the
incident took place in February.
''An internal investigation, in terms of our disciplinary procedures,
has been suspended while court proceedings have been ongoing.
''Now that these have concluded, we will resume our examination of the
issue with Mr Christie. It would be wrong for me to comment further in
advance of this discussion.''
One of Mr Christie's teaching colleagues at the school said: ''We are
not at liberty to speak to you,'' and referred inquiries to the regional
council.
A spokeswoman for the teachers' union, the EIS, said: ''Mr Christie
was not represented by the EIS, therefore we cannot comment.''

LOW Moss Prison, Bishopbriggs, has been stopped from recruiting
ex-prison officers from an employment agency to cover up for staff
shortages at night.
The practice was drawn to the attention of the Edinburgh headquarters
of the Scottish Prison Service by the main staff union, the Scottish
Prison Officers' Association.
SPOA's general secretary, Mr Derek Turner, yesterday told The Herald:
''We became seriously worried by the implications when we learned what
was going on. When we alerted headquarters, they plainly did not know it
was happening.''
Mr Turner said the shortages had arisen after a large number of SPS
officers had taken redundancy packages, a point conceded by SPS
spokesman Mr John Gerrie.
Mr Gerrie said 300 officers had already accepted severance packages,
with another wave leaving in the autumn. The SPS was meanwhile
''recruiting like mad''. When the legal implications were examined by
SPS headquarters, it asked the governor of Low Moss, Mr Bill Middleton,
to halt the practice.
Mr Turner pointed out that most recruiting was at the lowest end of
the scale, last year's staffing review having created a two-tier prison
officer job with non-contact jobs attracting lower pay. Officers can
apply for the better-paid contact jobs once they have completed two
years' probation.
Mr Turner said: ''We learned that three former officers, men who had
retired from the service with the redundancy package, were back working
in Low Moss on nightshift.
''Obviously they were capable of doing the job but the reality is that
the powers of the prison officer to imprison people, restrain them, and
impose punishments on them is laid down by statute and these men were no
longer governed by these statutes.
''What would have happened had a prisoner killed himself while one of
these men was responsible for his safety? Would he have been indemnified
by insurance, particularly if an FAI had found fault?
''The family could have raised a successful action against the SPS,
the local management, the agency, and the individual employee. The role
of the Secretary of State for Scotland could have been compromised. The
long-term implications for the service and for individuals were
horrifying.''

As England braces itself for the demise of the milkman -- and the loss
of 1500 jobs Kirsty Scott reports that the crisis in the South is
unlikely to affect the Scottish market
SCOTLAND'S dairy industry watched the latest development in England's
deepening milk crisis with interest yesterday, but with little sense of
foreboding that the same traumatic changes will affect the north.
The announcement by Unigate -- Britain's biggest doorstep-delivery
firm -- that they were cutting 1500 jobs has brought the dairy trade and
Labour out fighting. There were dire warnings that the number of milkmen
in England and Wales could be cut from 25,000 to 10,000, and a pledge
from Labour to fight for the future of the industry in general, and the
doorstep delivery service in particular.
However, industry representatives in Scotland say the milkman has
never been a particularly dominant figure in the north, and Scotland
went through the most marked changes in milk sales in the 1980s when
consumers started topping up doorstep deliveries by using corner shops
and, ultimately, supermarkets.
At the moment there are only 1200 milk rounds in Scotland and the
doorstep service accounts for about 16% of milk sales countrywide --
dropping to about 10% in the major cities. The trade is decreasing by 3%
annually. In England and Wales, 50% of milk is delivered to the door.
''We have gone through that barrier,'' said Billy Keane, finance
director for Robert Wiseman Dairies, one of Scotland's top milk
operators.
''We went through it in the eighties with the growth of supermarkets
and even corner shops in Scotland. We pioneered the sale of milk through
shops. That never really happened in England. Now they are going off the
doorstep straight into the supermarket. In Scotland, we always had the
in-between trade.''
Mr Keane said deregulation had also hit England harder because the
milk selling system was less flexible than it was in Scotland, with Milk
Marque -- the successor to the Milk Marketing Board -- sticking to a
rigid pricing structure.
''It has caused dairy companies to panic and buy more than they
otherwise would have done, so that caused prices to rise. The English
system is much less flexible than in Scotland.''
Across at the Scottish Dairy Association, chief executive Dr Donald
McQueen agreed that it would be wrong to apply the changes taking place
in England and Wales to the Scottish market.
''In Scotland we have been through most of that. The doorstep delivery
system has never been as important here as it was in England.''
Under deregulation, the milk marketing boards, which controlled
prices, were abolished, to be replaced by farmers' co-operatives. In
Scotland there are three main co-operatives, the biggest of which is
Scottish Milk. In England and Wales, Milk Marque entered into annual
agreements on supplies to its customers. In Scotland, Scottish Milk has
been auctioning off milk to the highest bidders.
Following deregulation, the price of milk is estimated to have jumped
about 3p a pint in Scotland, although some industry officials say it was
closer to 2p. The average price advantage between supermarkets and home
deliveries is around 14p.
Industry officials in Scotland say the impact of the changes will
probably be longer-term as operators streamline themselves to compete in
the deregulated market-place. Already, Scottish Pride has announced a
total of 170 job cuts as it restructures itself.
A Scottish Pride spokeswoman said it would be wrong to believe
Scotland would miss out on the rationalisation taking place in the
South.
''It will be the most efficient low-cost operator who will be there at
the end. That's what we are seeking to achieve. We are trying to be very
efficient.''
A spokesman for a small independent dairy in Central Scotland, said:
''We have had a lot of milk going through the supermarket chains for a
long time now. That's why we are not seeing the job losses at the
moment, but that's going to come just shortly.''
The spokesman said smaller operators were rationalising as they went
along, not replacing people who retired or left the company.
Just over a week ago, Robert Wiseman Dairies announced the takeover of
the Co-operative Wholesale Society's liquid milk operations in Scotland.
CWS decided to quit the Scottish market because of the decline in
doorstep deliveries and because it would have needed to make a big
investment at a time of great change in the trade.
Wiseman's Billy Keane admitted yesterday that the takeover, which
takes effect at the beginning of July, would mean that there would
''inevitably be some rationalisation to make it as efficient as
possible''.
Industry officials, however, point to the fact that while milk
consumption may be declining a little across the UK, it is still a
crucial commodity.
''Twenty-five per cent of all milk sold goes for breakfast cereals and
50% of all milk sold goes in tea and coffee,'' said one. ''You've got a
pretty solid base there.''
In Scotland we have been through most of that. The doorstep delivery
system has never been as important here as it was in England

The danger Thatcher poses to Major: John Campbell examines the reasons
why the lady is for turning on her successor
LADY Thatcher's latest volley of multi-media interviews (radio,
television and press) in support of her memoirs takes to new heights the
now traditional practice of Tory ex-Prime Ministers publicly slagging
their successors.
It was thought to be very bad form when Ted Heath paraded his quarrel
with her; there was tremendous tutting and headshaking at his
unforgivable disloyalty, which was unfavourably contrasted with Alec
Douglas-Home's exemplary loyalty towards him (and even Harold Wilson's
refusal to offer helpful advice to Jim Callaghan). Lady Thatcher
repeatedly insists that she has no wish to make difficulties for Major
as Heath did for her; yet every time she opens her mouth she goes much
further than he ever did.
She is far more dangerous to Major than Heath was to her. The
difference lies not primarily in their motivation. Heath's criticism was
routinely put down to personal pique at his humiliating supersession; in
fact, it had a serious political basis, above all in his deep dismay at
his successor's scepticism towards Europe.
Lady Thatcher's disappointment too centres on John Major's attitude to
Europe; but she is equally clearly unable to forgive or accept her
untimely dismissal. In both cases the personal and political are
inextricable.
However, Heath was a discredited loner on whom the Tory party
decisively turned its back, not immediately in 1975 but certainly after
1981. He liked to speak as though he and his friends still represented
the true Conservative tradition; but he never made common cause with the
Tory ''wets'' or lent his name to any faction.
Lady Thatcher, in contrast, has three or four acknowledged disciples
in the Cabinet and remains a heroine to a large and noisy section of the
party in the country. Her record is increasingly contentious, and
probably the majority of the party is still heartily glad that it got
rid of her. But the zealots still hanker, if not for her return,
certainly for a return to red-blooded Thatcherism, and in any party it
is the zealots who make the running.
Major's troubles are partly his own fault, since he has failed
abjectly to stand up to the zealots and give them a lead of his own. He
was saddled from the moment he took office by the burden of being her
(reluctantly) anointed successor.
The Tory party responds to a clear lead, but he was denied the freedom
both Mrs Thatcher in 1975 and Heath in 1965 enjoyed to strike out in a
new direction. She left him an impossible act to follow; the myth of a
great leader, a legacy of supposed economic transformation and the
expectation of unending political success -- but also a severe
recession, a party seriously divided over Europe and an agenda of
increasingly problematic privatisation and structural reform. Major has
struggled to complete this second-hand agenda with the tide which
sustained her now flowing against him. Inevitably he is vulnerable to
the charge that he is not a patch on her.
His only option now is to hit back ad feminam. So long as she merely
murmured her disappointment privately to friends there was not much he
could do. But now that she has come out in open denunciation, he too is
freed from the obligations of deference and loyalty. He -- or rather his
office -- could now portray her as a demented old monomaniac, which
sadly is how she appears.
Ranting away on the Today programme about socialism and freedom, the
single currency and the sacrifice of sovereignty, she sounded suddenly
very old. She is actually only 69, but her unstoppable flow of righteous
certainties seemed to come from a different era. If they are ready to be
cruel enough, it should not be difficult for Major and Hurd to make her
as much of a liability to the Eurosceptics as Heath was for so long to
the Tory ''wets''.
Lady Thatcher's decline into messianic monomania since 1990 is sad,
since she was a much more subtle and sophisticated politician than she
now appears. The first volume of her memoirs did history no service by
presenting her ten-year reign as one long crusade of cast-iron
certainty. The truth is that she was much more cautious and more
pragmatic than she now wishes to remember.
She would never have had the success she did if she had been as
uncompromising as she now pretends. Thatcherism, in fact, unfolded
opportunistically only as the horizon expanded in front of her. The
blueprint did not exist in 1979, but evolved as she went along. Volume
Two takes the process of self-mythologisation one stage further. It
begins in Grantham and ends with quite astonishing hubris at the Day of
Judgment. In November, 1990 the men in grey suits showed her the door of
Downing Street; five years later John Major's hope must be that the men
in white coats will not be far behind.
* Following his prize-winning Edward Heath, John Campbell is now
writing a biography of Margaret Thatcher.
Lady Thatcher's decline into messianic monomania since 1990 is sad,

BRITAIN's largest union, Unison, yesterday condemned the non-TUC Royal
College of Nursing for ''selling out'' at a crucial time for the pay
dispute involving 900,000 NHS employees, half of them Unison members.
Just days before Thursday's exploratory talks between the bulk of the
health unions and the NHS, the 2000 delegates to Unison's annual
conference in Brighton were deeply critical of the RCN. The only
argument was over the timing of a national day of demonstration in
support of the dispute.
Moving the successful emergency motion, Ms Anne Picking, chair of
Unison's health group executive, launched a savage attack on the RCN
leadership, which ''sometimes made Joe Stalin look like a model of
democratic accountability''.
The Dunfermline staff nurse, who now lives and works in Kent, accused
the RCN of ignoring the overwhelming vote of RCN delegates against
Government attempts to impose local pay bargaining.
Instead, in the face of opposition from every other union in the NHS,
the RCN general secretary, Ms Christine Hancock, was expected to
instruct her officials to begin local negotiations, unilaterally, once
300 NHS trusts had made local offers.
Ms Picking said local bargaining the RCN way would mean the effective
end of the NHS pay review bodies and would mean ''the full-blooded
introduction of local pay based on performance and productivity and
dependent on each NHS trust's financial performance -- something totally
beyond staffs' control''.
Sick pay, performance pay, and annual leave would all be under threat.
Together the unions had held off local pay so far and it would be a
tragedy if the actions of one union allowed the Government off the hook.
Unison opposed local bargaining on the grounds that it was bad for
staff, patients, and the NHS, she said, adding that the union executive
regarded the dispute as so vital for the future of the NHS and its staff
that it was making available the union's #10m fighting fund.
Conference gave overwhelming support to the union's existing policy of
pressing for a statutory national minimum wage of at least #4.15 an
hour.

Patrick Brogan in Washington explains the niceties of etiquette, and
the right technique to achieve that much-sought-after introduction to
the Windsors
THE golden rule on super-posh occasions is that you don't rush over to
see the royals; you wait for the royals to come to you. They are
disciplined creatures, genetically programmed to move in a slow orbit
around the room, or the garden as the case may be.
It's a simple problem in applied geometry to work out where the royal
will go -- and if you want to see him/her up close, simply put yourself
there, and wait for him. Or her.
There's a corollary: being in the right place doesn't mean you
actually get to meet the royal. A portable cocoon envelopes her, or
rather a guard of polite but very firm, military officers in full rig
who keep the jostling crowd at bay. The head factotum pulls the elect
from the front rank for a few words, the royal listens, speaks, smiles
and passes on. It's all very efficient.
I observed the ritual at Buckingham Palace garden parties, and at a
State visit to Paris over 20 years ago. It hasn't changed in the
slightest. Princess Anne was here the other day for the Queen's Birthday
and there was a big bash at the embassy.
She was in a blue, flouncy dress and hat and was surrounded by those
efficient young officers, and as she progressed anti-clockwise around
the garden, the ambassador, Sir Robin Renwick, plucked a select few from
the crowd for a select few words. Then we all moved off for champagne
and strawberries. No, I wasn't one of the elect.
Journalists sometimes get to attend events above their station. The
most splendid I ever got into was a State reception for the Queen at
Versailles. This was the gallerie des glaces as it appeared in the days
of Louis XV, candle-lit, with a band at each end and one in the middle
(the room is so long that they didn't interfere with each other), and
huge buffets groaning with the finest that French cuisine and vineyards
could produce.
For me, though, the fun bit came earlier when the evening began with a
performance in the Versailles opera. The reception followed it. I had
one ticket to the show, so my wife went to the opera and I had two hours
to kill -- and the run of Versailles in all its splendour, all to
myself.
I suppose the footmen, butlers, waiters, lackeys, and other
attendants, having set everything up, had retired for a last smoke.
At any event, I could wander through all those splendours
unquestioned, meeting no-one, ending up in the most private of all
places set aside for the royal visitor and her attendants.
Naturally, she had to retire after two hours of opera, and, since
there is no plumbing in the palace, a sort of royal portajohn was
provided.
Earlier in the day, reporters covering the tour had been summoned to a
small reception at the Trianon -- the hotel, alas, not the chateau.
Still, it is pretty grand as these things go -- and the Queen did her
circulating manoeuvre to meet us all, arriving back at the door exactly
an hour after entering. It was all very well timed.
Just for the record, the Duke of Edinburgh stood in the middle of the
room, and the hacks were rotated up to meet him, creating a sort of
subsidiary whirlpool within the larger one caused by the Queen's
progress around the room. Come to think of it, she went anti-clockwise,
too.
The White House, and American protocol, are different. The President
receives guests as they come in with a hearty smile and a firm
handshake. They are all voters, after all. George Bush could never keep
his hands out of his pockets, so he always had his left hand out of
sight when shaking yours with the other.
A week before the Queen's birthday party at the British Embassy, there
was another gathering there, in honour of Glasgow University's
contribution to the big Whistler exhibitions here. A little old lady,
who had attended the university in the 30s, remarked: ''I was last in
this room to meet Princess Elizabeth.''
I should have asked her if the princess had gone around the room
clockwise or anti-clockwise.

A SHIPPING line's operations manager has been awarded #9604 after an
industrial tribunal in Glasgow found he had been unfairly dismissed,
despite being fired for dishonestly claiming sick pay.
James McGeehan, 36, of Tweed Lane, Holytown, Lanarkshire, was employed
at the East Kilbride office of Shetland Line (1984) Ltd, which carried
freight between Orkney, Shetland, and Aberdeen.
He started working for the company in September 1988 and was fired
last September for dishonestly claiming sick pay.
Mr McGeehan started to feel ill in June 1993 and, on several occasions
after that, he coughed up blood. He didn't tell anyone about his illness
and carried on working, although he also suffered from severe
indigestion.
Towards the end of 1993, he told his assistant, Douglas Gray, that he
was going ''to take a sicky''. He also mentioned to Mr Gray that his
contract of employment gave him six months off sick on full pay but had
a clause allowing him to be sacked if he was off for longer.
At the end of March 1993, shortly before going on holiday, Mr McGeehan
gave Mrs Jennifer McLellan, a traffic clerkess at East Kilbride, a lift
in his car and when she said: ''Have a nice holiday, see you when you
return,'' he replied: ''Maybe not. I'm taking a sicky.''
Both Mrs McLellan and Mr Gray reported the conversations to Mr Ian
Adam, the general manager at East Kilbride.
The tribunal noted that Mr McGeehan and Mr Adam never really got on.
Mr Adam had been promoted over Mr McGeehan.
Mr McGeehan went off work on April 5, 1994, and did not return to work
until September 27.
The next afternoon, he was told he had to attend a meeting of the
directors in Aberdeen the following morning.
He wasn't told the reason for the meeting but, when he arrived after
driving up in his company car, a brown envelope was lying on the table
with #35 in it for the train fare home.
The allegations of dishonesty were put to Mr McGeehan, who said he
couldn't return to work against doctor's orders.
Mrs McLellan and Mr Gray were not there to be cross-examined, and no
written statement was produced from them.
During his illness, Mr McGeehan went into the East Kilbride office
with his sick note but at no point did Mr Adam put his suspicions to the
Mr McGeehan.
The tribunal stated that it ''had no difficulty in concluding that the
applicant was dismissed because of dishonestly claiming sick pay'' but
it decided the dismissal was unfair because there had been inadequate
investigation.
In deciding to reduce the award by 25% to #9604, the percentage the
applicant had contributed to his own dismissal, the tribunal noted that
someone of Mr McGeehan's senior position should have let his employer
know he was going to be off for an extended period.

A MOTORIST who was convicted of reckless driving after a collision in
which the other driver was killed, has lost a #60,000 damages claim
against the victim's parents.
A sheriff who heard the civil case at Greenock has thrown out a claim
by Alan Inglis that Mr Stuart McKeegan, 18, was wholly or partly to
blame for the accident between Wemyss Bay and Gourock in July, 1991.
Mr McKeegan's family said yesterday that they were delighted by the
judgment which, they said, completely vindicated their son.
They also accused Inglis of being ''remorseless'' and said his legal
action had caused them further grief after the tragedy.
Their son, a student at Glasgow Caledonian University, was killed when
his Vauxhall Nova car was struck by Inglis's Volkswagen Golf car on a
sweeping bend on the A78 at Inverkip.
Mr McKeegan had been on the way to his grandmother's house to make her
an evening meal when the accident happened.
Inglis, 30, a fishmonger, of Manor Crescent, Gourock, was found guilty
of reckless driving in September 1992, fined #2000 and disqualified from
driving for four years.
He later raised the civil action for compensation and sued Mr
McKeegan's parents, who live in Lomond Road, Wemyss Bay.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Sheriff Sir Stephen Young
criticised Inglis's version of events, saying there was nothing about
the manner in which he gave his evidence which had a particular ring of
truth about it.
He said the overall tone of his account and the reckless manner of his
driving in the seconds before the collision showed him to be a selfish
person with an indifferent attitude to the safety of other road users.
The evidence as to the position of the dead youth's car immediately
prior to impact and the speed at which the pursuer was driving had to be
taken with a large measure of scepticism, he added.
The sheriff said he believed Mr McKeegan had been driving carefully
and at a moderate speed well into his own side of the road when the
Volkswagen approached from the opposite direction.
He felt Inglis was already committed to cross the centre line and cut
the corner when he saw the Vauxhall, braked heavily, and lost control of
his vehicle.
There was no evidence from skid marks to show that there had been any
attempt to steer the Volkswagen away and avoid the impact.
Inglis had claimed the Vauxhall was on the wrong side of the road when
the two cars met and that he was unable to avoid a collision.
Describing his version as somewhat cool and detached, the sheriff said
the inescapable conclusion he had reached was that Inglis was either
steering deliberately to the offside in order to cut the corner, or that
his car was travelling so fast that it was out of control.
Hitting out at criticism levelled against the dead youth and claims
that his vehicle had been marginally across the centre line of the road
just prior to the collision, the sheriff said: ''It scarcely seems right
that he should be adversely criticised for failing to anticipate
reckless driving of the kind displayed by the pursuer.
''I certainly do not think that it has been shown that, in the dire
circumstances in which he found himself, he was to any extent at fault.
''In my opinion, it is plain on the evidence before me (which was not
on all fours with the evidence led during his trial), that the accident
was caused by the fault of the pursuer in driving his car around the
bend in question recklessly, and at a grossly excessive speed.''
During the civil hearing, the court was told that Inglis had a
previous conviction in 1990 for reckless driving. Sheriff Young stressed
that he had not attached any weight to the fact.
The sheriff has reserved a decision on the question of expenses and
will hear submissions from both parties on Thursday.
The dead youth's father, Mr Bill McKeegan, 52, said after the finding
that his family was ''absolutely relieved'' that the matter had been
concluded.
''We are also delighted that Stuart has been vindicated. He had done
nothing wrong but, even at the trial, it felt like he was the one on
trial.''
Mr McKeegan said he, his wife Joan, 48, and 20-year-old son Kenneth,
had been unable to understand why Inglis had attempted to sue them for
damages.
''It was plain to anyone that if someone has been in an accident where
someone has died you don't pursue the victim's relatives.
''Mr Inglis should have been full of remorse and tried to forget about
the crash, but he obviously doesn't have any remorse.
''He wanted to gain from it and we were both angry and very hurt by
that,'' said Mr McKeegan. ''We just couldn't understand it.''
Mr McKeegan, a vending machine engineer, added that the civil action
had badly affected his family in trying to come to terms with the loss
of their son.
Inglis was not available for comment yesterday.

ROME: Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, his political
fortunes boosted by a decisive victory in a referendum on television
ownership, yesterday called for a general election by the autumn.
Seizing the initiative after Italians voted by 57% to 43 on Sunday
against a move that would have forced him to break up his television
empire, the media magnate said the country had to return to what he
called ''democratic normality''.

Boston, Monday
A CRUISE ship with 1500 passengers and crew aboard headed to Boston
today after it was refloated from shallow waters off Cape Cod where it
strayed off course and ran aground.
US Coast Guard officials said they have launched an investigation into
why the luxury liner, Royal Majesty, was sailing miles outside normal
shipping lanes when it ran aground 10 miles east of Nantucket Island
late on Saturday.
There were no injuries to either passengers or crew, but rough sea
conditions scuttled a planned evacuation of the passengers yesterday.
The 568ft Bermuda-to-Boston ocean liner carrying 989 passengers and
520 crew members will be inspected for damage on arrival at the east
coast port.
Coast Guard officials said the ship ran aground on the Rose and Crown
Shoal off Nantucket in just 11ft of water in an area of shallow water
that is plainly marked on nautical charts.
The incident happened in calm seas in clear visibility. Tugs freed the
vessel about 23 hours after it ran aground.
''They were outside the normal shipping channel,'' said Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Glenn Rosenholm. ''The shipping channel is several
miles from there.''
The ship was between 10 and 17 miles off course.
The Royal Majesty has a 19[1/2]ft draught, the depth of water required
to remain afloat.
The Boston Herald quoted Paris Katsoufia, president of the Majesty
Cruise Lines of Miami, as saying that the vessel's master, Captain
Nicholas Astanis, is a 20-year seafaring veteran.
Majesty Cruise Lines owns the Panamanian-registered liner.
Coast Guard Lieutenant Paul Wolf said it was not known if Captain
Astanis was on the bridge when the ship ran aground.
The 32,400-ton vessel, built in Finland in 1992, was equipped with
state-of-the art electronic navigation equipment, company officials
said.
Continued rough seas prevented divers from inspecting the vessel's
bottom after it was freed from the shoal.--Reuter.

Cape Town, Monday
A MAN suspected of being a serial killer and dubbed South Africa's
''Station Strangler'' was found guilty today of murdering a young boy.
Judge Wally van Deventer said the state had proved beyond all
reasonable doubt that Norman Afzal Simons, 27, murdered Elroy van Rooyen
in March 1994.
''The court has unanimously found that the state has proven beyond all
reasonable doubt that he was the man who kidnapped Elroy . . . and
therefore he is guilty of the murder,'' the judge told Cape Town Supreme
Court.
After the judge's guilty verdict, Simons moaned, closed his eyes and
slumped back in his seat in the court dock.
Police said in affidavits presented earlier in the trial that Simons
had told them voices from his brother, who was murdered in 1991, lived
in him and ordered him to kill. He began hearing the voices after his
brother sodomised him.
Simons was first believed to have killed 21 boys and a young man, all
of mixed-race, during an eight-year killing spree. Most were found
buried in shallow graves in the Cape Town area after being sodomised and
strangled.
Simons has so far only been charged with the murder of 10-year-old van
Rooyen.
The boy was last seen alive boarding a train with Simons at Cape
Town's Strand railway station on March 11, 1994. His badly decomposed
body was found 10 days later with his hands tied behind his back.
The judge postponed the trial until tomorrow when evidence in
mitigation of sentence will be presented.--Reuter.

Moscow, Monday
RUSSIAN forces are close to capturing the village of Shatoi in the
south of Chechnya, a key stronghold still in the hands of local
separatists, a senior Russian commander told Itar-Tass news agency
today.
Major-General Vladimir Bulgakov said his forces were only a mile away
from Shatoi, where the rebels of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev are
believed to have their headquarters after surrendering the previous base
of Vedeno on June 4.
At the weekend Russian forces launched what is widely expected to be a
decisive offensive against the remaining bastions of Dudayev's rebels in
the southern mountains.
Their objectives are Shatoi and Nozhay-Yurt with the aim of cutting
rebel forces in half. Russian commanders believe there are only 3000
rebels left in the mountains.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Monday
UN officials said today that Bosnian Serb retaliation for Nato air
strikes had crippled their peacekeeping mission. The Serbs, however,
signalled that more of their UN hostages could soon be set free.
''A lot of the shots are being called by the Bosnian Serbs right
now,'' spokesman Alexander Ivanko told reporters.
UN officials said they were forced to plead for permission to bring
aid into Sarajevo and other besieged government enclaves since the
Bosnian Serbs imposed a virtual blockade on relief deliveries.
The new European Union envoy to former Yugoslavia, Carl Bildt, said he
was optimistic that 144 UN soldiers still held by the Bosnian Serbs
would be freed soon.
''The most urgent thing now is to have the release of the hostages. I
take it for granted that will happen,'' Bildt told reporters after his
first meeting with EU foreign ministers.
Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister appointed by the EU last
Friday, was due to meet British Prime Minister John Major as part of yet
another attempt to revive stalled peace efforts.
The envoy's comments coincided with signals from Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic that the release of another batch of UN detainees was
imminent.
''We will have news about the prisoners tomorrow,'' Karadzic said in
Pale, outside Sarajevo.
The Bosnian Serbs took UN soldiers hostage after Nato warplanes bombed
Serb ammunition dumps around Sarajevo last month.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who has publicly criticised his
former proteges for taking hostages, recently intervened to secure the
release of 232 peacekeepers.
''It's still outrageous that UN personnel are being held hostage and
as human shields by the Bosnian Serbs,'' Ivanko said.
One UN military observer was being held at a radar station in the
mountains above Sarajevo as a ''human shield'' against further Nato air
raids, he said.
The West has condemned the Serbs for taking UN hostages but has backed
away from calls for more Nato bombing raids despite continued Serb
flouting of UN authority.
Diplomats say Milosevic has attempted to trade in his leverage in the
hostage crisis for concessons in negotiations with the major powers'
Contact Group.
The Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and
Germany -- hopes to isolate the Bosnian Serb leadership by persuading
Milosevic to recognise Bosnia's borders in return for easing sanctions
on rump Yugoslavia.
But the separatist Serbs were sticking to their hardline stance which
had forced UN officials to accept fresh restrictions on their authority.
The Serbs refused over the weekend to allow three UN convoys into
eastern Bosnian enclaves where civilians and peacekeepers faced acute
shortages of food and medical supplies.
UN warehouses were empty in Sarajevo and relief officials said they
had agreed to Serb demands that aid convoys bound for the city would be
escorted by Bosnian Serb soldiers.
The commander of the Bosnian Serb army, General Ratko Mladic,
threatened today to block trucks carrying food for UN troops in the
Gorazde pocket unless government defenders retreated, UN officials said.
Mladic told the United Nations a resupply convoy bound for British and
Ukrainian peacekeepers in the Gorazde enclave would remain blocked until
Muslim-led Bosnian government forces pulled back from recently captured
positions.
UN officials said that fighting raged yesterday in Gorazde with
government troops gaining some high ground and Serb forces had launched
retaliatory shelling of Gorazde town, 30 miles east of
Sarajevo.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Monday
POLICE reinforced potential flashpoints around Johannesburg today
after local leaders of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party threatened chaos.
But a senior Inkatha official said the party did not sanction the
threats and would take action against those who warned they would
enforce a protest strike over the shooting of Zulu marchers last year.
Inkatha MP Musa Myeni said: ''We will definitely discipline them. Our
disciplinary action ranges from fines to suspension to expulsion.''
Police spokesman Jan Combrinck said extra police had been put on the
streets in response to the threats of violence.
''We have deployed policemen at all focal points, like stations and
taxi ranks,'' he said.
The threat of a possible ''bloodbath'' came at the weekend from
Inkatha regional official Sipho Magubane, who said the party would use
force if necessary to mount its protest strike.
''Gauteng province will be ungovernable if Nelson Mandela is not
arrested,'' he told a news conference.
The rhetoric kept the pot boiling in the dispute between Inkatha and
the ruling African National Congress.
Mugabane's strike call was in response to Mandela's admission last
week that he had ordered security guards to shoot Inkatha supporters if
they attacked the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg during a protest
shortly before last year's first all-race elections.
Eight Inkatha supporters were killed outside Shell House in central
Johannesburg and Inkatha has demanded Mandela be charged with murder.
Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi told supporters yesterday
that Inkatha would launch a non-violent protest campaign against the
government.--Reuter.

Kuala Lumpur, Monday
THE US and communist North Korea finally agreed today how to implement
an earlier deal to curb the North's nuclear programme, chief American
negotiator Thomas Hubbard said.
''We have reached an understanding on a text,'' he said after talks
with the North Koreans in the Malaysian capital. The deal must now go to
both governments for approval.
He would not say what was actually agreed with North Korea's Kim
Kye-gwan. A North Korean diplomat confirmed a deal had been thrashed
out.
Both sides have been meeting here since May 20 to try to implement a
deal signed last October in Geneva. This was aimed at curbing what
Washington suspected was North Korea's ambition to make nuclear weapons.

Washington, Monday
CAPTAIN Scott O'Grady came home to a hero's welcome yesterday and was
subjected to the full treatment today: an official reception at the
Pentagon and lunch at the White House and the ceaseless attentions of
the media.
He is on the cover of newsmagazines, and TV specials are devoted to
his exploits. The only thing spared him so far is a tickertape parade
down Broadway.
Anyone would think this was the Entebbe rescue or the return of
Douglas MacArthur. In fact, it is a small, bright incident to enliven
the dreadful dilemma the United States and its allies face in Bosnia.
At the Pentagon ceremony, held in driving rain, President Clinton
said: ''Captain O'Grady's courage has made all Americans proud.''
Secretary of Defence William Perry said the rescue was a triumph of
technology. O'Grady was able to communicate with the searching planes
overhead, and was also able to pinpoint his position so accurately,
using a military communications satellite, that the rescue helicopters
were able to land 50 yards from him.
O'Grady has repeatedly said he was saved by God and his faith, and by
the US Marines.
He has also described repeatedly how he survived six days behind enemy
lines. His chief advantage, probably, was that he was better trained
than his pursuers.
He was shot down on June 2, and opened his parachute at 20,000ft. That
meant that Serb gunners on the ground had ample time to see him and to
prepare to catch him. O'Grady realised the danger, and the moment he
landed abandoned his parachute and hid in woods.

THE way to stay out of trouble, Mr Peter Bottomley (Eltham -- Con.)
advised his fellow-MPs is to do nothing you would be unwilling to see
reported in your local newspaper. This seemed a variation on the adage
formally addressed to adolescents to do nothing they would be ashamed
for their mother to know about.
Mr Major, not present in the House yesterday, may have been reflecting
that one way to stay out of trouble is not to succeed Lady Thatcher as
Prime Minister.
After reading her rather lengthy list of shortcomings at No. 10 since
she demitted office he may not have been soothed by her patronising
conclusion that ''The Prime Minister is becoming more Conservative every
day.''
Welsh Secretary John Redwood, one of the three most devoted Thatcher
groupies in the Cabinet, was asked bluntly by his Labour Shadow, Mr Ron
Davies, whose side he was really on in this ''hopelessly split''
Conservative Party.
''Of course, I support the present Prime Minister,'' said Mr Redwood,
getting it over as quickly as possible and doubtless excusing himself on
the grounds that Mr Major is the only and therefore the best Prime
Minister we have and that the loyalty pledge is the price you pay for a
seat in the Cabinet.
He wisely did not let Lady Thatcher's name cross his lips, refrained
from comparing the present man's stewardship with hers and stuck to
areas like reducing total public expenditure as a proportion of Gross
National Product and cutting taxes which unite all conservatives even if
their government has not been very good at doing either recently.
Otherwise, he and a couple of effective junior Ministers kept the
Welsh Opposition at bay, only briefly foxed by Mr Allan Rogers
(Rhondda-Labour) who flung in a reference to ''morphology'' which had
ministers looking frantically at the civil servant's box for help and
wishing they had brought their pocket dictionaries with them. ''It's the
shape of the valleys'' said Mr Rogers airily. ''It militates against
effective transport links.'' One can't really attend a Question Time
session without learning something new.
The Welsh Nationalists Eifyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) was so
pleased with the word that he suggested to Mr Gwilym Jones, the
Under-Secretary, that enclosed as he was in the morphology of Cardiff
North (Mr Jones's constituency) he was out of touch with the rest of
Wales. Mr Jones said he was surprised to hear a Welsh Nationalist
insulting his country's capital.
Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster -- who has the
misfortune to be the Minister in charge of the Nolan Committee
recommendations as they affect the Government -- spent most of his time
telling Labour MPs to read the report as most the allegations they were
making were not in it.
Mr Michael Fabricant, the exotically coiffed MP for Mid
Stafffordshire, offered a more acceptable question on how the Citizen's
Charter was doing. Extremely well, said Mr Hunt warmly. In some cases
customer satisfaction with organisations involved had reached as high as
97%.
''An encouraging answer indeed'' swooned Mr Fabricant, Heepishly,
although the percentage recalled the margins by which East European
communist regimes used to be returned to office by grateful electors
with no other party to vote for.
This bout of self-congratulation was interrupted by Mr David Winnick
(Walsall North -- Lab.) suggesting that a negative Charter Mark should
be introduced for organisations like the present Government. ''The most
discredited and unpopular in our history.''
We know that if opinion polls had existed the Anglo-Saxons would have
turned out the William the Conqueror administration and if the peasants
had been polled Richard II's government would not have lasted as long as
it did.
On the other hand recent historical research has tended to the view
that Bloody Mary's executive might have topped 25% in a
sixteenth-century Gallup, putting it well ahead of the latest Major
record.
Possibly disconcerted by this, Mr Hunt absent-mindedly insulted a
helper, Dr Robert Spink (Castle Point -- Con.), whose question, straight
out of the Tory whip's manual, asked if the Opposition should not
encourage pride in being British rather than selling Britain down the
river.
As Labour's deputy leader had said, cried Mr Hunt, ''any fool should
know that would be the consequence of Labour policies.'' Dr Spink's
smile seemed a little forced.

NEW life will be breathed into Aberdeen's Marischal College under a
#20m plan -- explained in detail for the first time yesterday -- to turn
it into a 194-bedroom hotel.
Externally, there will be no changes, other than to restore some of
its original appearance.
Forced into seeking options for the city landmark, Aberdeen University
looked at various possibilities and approached numerous organisations
but the only single proposal for the building came from Scandic,
Northern Europe's leading hotel group.
A planning application is now before Aberdeen District Council and, if
approved, the hotel, with conference centres, swimming pool, gym, and
restaurants could be open in little more than two years, employing
around 120 full-time staff.
University Principal Professor Maxwell Irvine stressed that the
university was not selling Marischal College, simply leasing the largest
part of it to the hotel group. The Mitchell Wing, with its historic
hall, picture gallery, and anthropological museum will be retained for
ceremonial, cultural, and community use.
The most significant external change in the plan will be the removal
of car parking from the quadrangle where, instead, trees will be
planted. An ornamental lamp standard and pond will provide a turning
point for vehicles dropping off hotel guests.
New car parking on two levels, the new level below ground, would be
created at the rear.
Professor Irvine said the university simply did not have the money to
either speculatively develop the building or to refurbish it to the
standard required.
Mr Jens Christensen, managing director of Scandic UK, said it had
intended to open a hotel in Aberdeen for some time and required a
city-centre site. He felt Aberdeen needed a ''high quality'' city-centre
hotel with international presence. The hotel would provide a natural
link to London and Edinburgh, where Scandic was already established.
''By opening Marischal College to the public through these facilities,
patrons will be able to share in the heritage and tradition of the
magnificent architecture which, to some extent, is at present kept under
wraps,'' he said. ''High- profile conference and business events will
add to the prestige and pride of the city.''
Architect Ian Begg, who worked with Scandic on its Edinburgh Royal
Mile hotel, said that an enormous amount of work would be needed on a a
difficult, complex job.
As an example of the sensitive approach being taken, the historic
oak-panelled courtroom with its heraldic ceiling and stained glass
windows, would be preserved in its entirety within the hotel.
''With respect to our past and to the architects who have gone before
us, we can gently but firmly move Marischal College forward to a new
existence with this proposal.
''Nobody is saying this is the last time it will change but, for the
present and into the foreseeable future, it makes sense with little, if
any, loss, aesthetically or architecturally. We care very much. We know
what we are handling and we will do it well.''
An exhibition of the proposals will be open to the public from Monday,
June 19, to Friday, June 23, in the Marischal Museum.

IN A bid to take over yet another policy area the Conservatives have
long considered theirs, Labour leader Tony Blair said yesterday his
party aims ''to become the real party of business and enterprise in
Britain today.''
Later this year, it will launch a nationwide programme of consultation
with the management and workforces of business, industry, services and
manufacturing, he announced yesterday in his speech to the annual
conference of the AEEU at Blackpool.
''It will be as big and, in my view, as important as our Clause 4
consultation,'' he added, and said the outcome of the meetings would
''inform our policy making.''
The launch looks well-timed, as leaders of industry and commerce will
be increasingly anxious to infleunce the policies of the party which
looks likely to be the next Government.
Mr Blair made clear that ''a lot more'' has to change within the
Labour Party itself, including its links with the trade unions.
He said ''The relationship between this party and the unions in a long
and enduring one. But we should never believe that the form it takes
must be set in concrete. Change must carry on.''
He forecast that the proportion of votes cast by unions at the Labour
conference would fall from 70% to 50% ''soon,'' and he urged that
greater efforts should be made to recruit trade unionists as individual
members. ''I don't want the Labour Party to be run by a narrow
London-based group of intellectual activists. We tried that before and
it didn't work,'' he said.
He asked if it was really impossible for the party to persuade one in
ten of the four million workers covered by the union levy and said party
meetings should be made more interesting so that new members were
retained.
It was ''complete and utter nonsense '' to say that because Labour was
back in the mainstream of politics they were now Tories. ''Far too
often, we have let the Tories occupy ground which is rightfully ours,''
he added.
Attacking the Government, he said there was now hardly an issue ''upon
which the factions don't come out to play.'' The Tories could not decide
whether to continue with Thatcherism or move beyond it.
''The result is paralysis and a Prime Minister trapped in the
headlights of a former Prime Minister who in the eyes of around half of
all Tory MPs never really left office.''
* Tory voters are switching to Labour as they opt for ''a different
way of running the country'', Mr Blair said yesterday.
The Labour leader was meeting ''wavering'' Tory voters as he
campaigned in the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency.
A by-election there, forecast for the end of July, has been caused by
the death last month of the Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, who had a slender
majority of 4494, with the Liberal Democrats in second place.
Mr Blair said the poll was about ''a different way of running the
country''.
He discounted suggestions that traditional Conservative voters in the
constituency would find it difficult to vote for Labour.
''The one thing I have no doubt about is that people who voted
Conservative at the last election are coming to Labour,'' he said.

A MAN with a grudge against his former school launched a horrific
flame-thrower attack against pupils sitting A-levels in the assembly
hall, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Garnett Bell, 46, fired a sheet of flame at boys in Sullivan Upper
School at Holywood, County Down, Northern Ireland, with a flame-thrower
improvised from a fire extinguisher, Antrim Crown Court was told.
Mr Bell, an unemployed electronics expert from east Belfast, held a
grudge against the school for giving him ''inappropriate and inadequate
career advice'' while a pupil, said Mr Ronald Appleton, QC, prosecuting.
The court was told Mr Bell ''planned the attack like a military
operation and had been planning it for some time''.
Mr Bell denies nine charges, three of attempting to murder 18-year-old
Darren Crawford, Adam Aston, and Stephen Crossland; three of causing
them grievous bodily harm with intent; and three of arson -- two at the
school and the other at his brother's home, which was burned to the
ground a few hours after the school attack on June 17 last year.
Mr Appleton said the defence accepted that Mr Bell had used the
flame-thrower -- the issue was whether he had intended to kill anyone.
He said Mr Bell had walked into the assembly hall where 31 pupils were
sitting A-level French or technology exams and sprayed the front row of
boys with a sheet of flame from the flame-thrower.
Mr Appleton said Mr Bell then turned the device on a second row of
boys, but the nozzle fell off, extinguishing the flames. Mr Bell dropped
the flame-thrower and fled.
Three boys -- those named in the charges -- were ''seriously and
horrifically burned''. They and other pupils, some injured, fled in
panic, several with their clothes on fire.
There was uproar in court when Mr Bell, who had been sitting in the
dock with his fingers in his ears, screamed at Mr Appleton half-way
through his opening speech: ''You lying bastard.''
The judge, Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Hutton, told
Mr Bell to be quiet or he would be removed from the court.
''I wish to be removed, sir,'' said Mr Bell.
''Very well, take him from the dock,'' the judge said.
The trial continues.

CHIEF Scout Garth Morrison yesterday described as ''seriously
distorted'' reports that the Scout Association was to abandon its oath
of loyalty following the Prince of Wales's admission of adultery.
''The Prince of Wales was never part of this discussion,'' said the
Scout leader.
Discussion of the Prince occurred only when a journalist posed a
question. Comments by the Chief Scout were ''general and in no way
represented a policy decision''. An article in the Sunday Times combined
several different, unrelated matters and made a connection which was
''totally incorrect'', claimed Mr Morrison.
The wording of the oath for the past 30 years has been: ''On my
honour, I promise I will do my best to do my duty to God and to the
Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout's Law.''
A periodic consultation was being proposed by the Scout Association as
part of a ''normal review process'' which could result in no change
whatsoever to the oath, said Mr Morrison.

BRITISH holidaymakers were warned yesterday that industrial action by
civil servants could result in serious delays in processing passport
applications this summer.
Members of the CPSA union, including staff at the Scottish office of
the Passport Agency in Glasgow, will today begin voting in a ballot
which may lead to a work-to-rule, or even a week-long strike next month.
Union leaders said they were furious at proposals for a 10% cut in the
workforce and a renewed attempt to involve the private sector in
passport production.
CPSA official Mr Andy Thomas said: ''The management's action has
caused a great deal of anger and resentment among staff. They fear the
cuts will take us back to the bad old days, when they were frustrated
and embarrassed by the service they offered to the public.''
A total of 1600 civil servants are employed at the UK's six main
passport offices, including about 250 in Glasgow.
The union said the performance of the service had improved
significantly since it became an executive agency of the Home Office in
1991.
It claimed that the maximum time for processing standard applications
had been reduced from 95 working days to 16 working days last year.
Mr Thomas said: ''A recent Cabinet Office report indicated that all
key targets in 1993/4 were not just achieved, but bettered.
''Yet the Government is making two major assumptions -- that fewer
staff will provide a better service to the public, and that the private
sector will be able to provide the experience, expertise and loyalty to
match that of existing staff.
''There is no proof to support either of these presumptions, and the
union believes this ballot is necessary to bring the employer back to
the negotiating table.''
The NUCPS union, which represents executive grades in the agency, is
balloting members on action short of a strike.

RANDOM roadside checks are to be made on lorries carrying animals for
slaughter which travel through Lothian, after an increase in reports
that many were injured and suffering unnecessarily.
An investigation by trading standard chiefs in the region showed that
many pigs, cattle, and sheep, who were clearly sick or injured before
they left the farm, were still being moved to the abattoir, causing them
further pain.
The farmers move the injured animals in order toget cash for them at
the abbatoir rather than killing them humanely on the farm.
Mr Mike Drewry, Lothian Regional Council's trading standards director,
said he believed that not enough care was being taken by the farming
community or those involved in transporting animals.
Over the next three weeks, Ministry of Agriculture vets in conjuction
with the police will check the conditions of the animals being
transported. Fines of up to #5000 or even a period of imprisonment can
be imposed on either the farmer or haulier, if they are found guilty of
breaking the law.
In some cases investigated by trading standards officers, sick animals
were transported more than 100 miles at a time. Most of the beasts
involved came from outwith Lothian, the majority from the north of
Scotland or from south of the Border.
In one case, 25 sheep with damaged limbs had been forced to undergo a
seven-hour journey. In another, from a batch of 230 sheep sent to the
abattoir, 120 of them had damaged feet.
Other cases highlighted included a bull transported from Grampian with
a swollen back foot who was left unable to stand, a pig with a huge
abscess on the side of its body, and a cow with a swelling on its rear
hoof.
In the last two weeks, there have been three separate reports on
different batches of injured animals, bringing to five the number of
reported cases this year in Lothian -- the same number the council
received for the whole of last year.
Mr Drewry said: ''Transporting animals who are clearly injured before
they leave the farm is often inappropriate and may cause further,
unnecessary suffering.
''Both the owners and the hauliers must have realised that these
animals were not fit to move.
''It is my belief that not enough care is being taken by the farming
community and those responsible for transporting them.
''In order to conquer this, increased surveillance on road side and
checks on vehicles entering Lothian carrying animals will be carried
out.''
The rules on transportation of unfit or injured animals is backed up
by a Code of Practice issued by the Ministry of Agriculture. It
emphasises that farmers and hauliers should seek veterinary advice, if
they are unsure about the condition of any animal.
UK statistics show that over a twelve-month period there were almost
5500 infringements of transit legislation and more than 1500
infringements of animal welfare legislation on premises where animals
were held.
Mr Richard Henton, commodity director for livestock with the National
Farmers' Union of Scotland, said it had not been informed of the
concerns of the trading standard officers regarding injured animals.
* Mr Drewry said the safety of meat from injured animals would not be
affected because meat inspectors check slaughtered animals for disease.

LABOUR MP Tam Dalyell yesterday questioned whether Commons Speaker
Betty Boothroyd should involve herself in presenting parliamentary
awards on behalf of the BBC for the Scottish Lobby programme.
Mr Dalyell (Linlithgow) urged Miss Boothroyd to think again about her
involvement, telling her: ''You have to be above these battles.''
However, the Speaker dismissed his demand, saying she had taken
''sound advice'' from other Members and insisting it would be a
''privilege and an honour'' to make the presentation.
Mr Dalyell said that later this month BBC Scotland and the programme
Scottish Lobby were proposing to have some parliamentary awards.
''I don't know whether it is really proper that the BBC should award
to MPs, according to criteria decided by them, parliamentary awards.
''But I do think it's a matter of some concern when the office of
Speaker becomes involved in this. It is understood that you are going to
present the awards.''
He told the Speaker: ''I do earnestly ask for reflection as to whether
with all this authority of the Speaker of the House of Commons that your
office should be involved -- maybe without any kind of judgment by you
-- in awarding awards to parliamentarians on a pretty invidious basis,
whatever the basis is, because you have to be above these battles.''
Miss Boothroyd said she had taken ''sound advice'' from many of Mr
Dalyell's colleagues, particularly Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson.
''I am not adjudicating whatsoever in this. But I consider it to be a
privilege and an honour simply to make the presentation to one or two of
my colleagues on whatever side of the House they may be sitting.''

JUST nine-years-old, but already Robert Bowden is a budding boffin,
and yesterday, the science-mad pupil was whisked from his classes to
Strathclyde Regional Chemist's laboratories in Colston, Glasgow, as a
surprise birthday present.
He was given his own white coat, allowed to try out experiments, and
then presented with a special birthday cake -- in the shape of a conical
flask.
Robert's visit to the laboratories, was kept a secret until a
limousine arrived to pick him up from the city's St Ambrose Primary
School in Mingulay Place. The trip was planned by his 11-year-old sister
Angela, who wrote to the regional chemist, Dr Peter Smith, asking if
Robert could be allowed a visit.
Dr Smith said: ''We were all delighted to show Robert what goes on in
the laboratory. We're sure the visit will be an even greater
encouragement to him to become a scientist.''
Robert said: ''It was a nice surprise. It's great fun seeing
experiments going on. I'd love to be a scientist when I grow up.''

<TEXT>
THE likelihood increased last night of a full-scale Commons debate on
membership of a committee of MPs to investigate how to implement the
Nolan proposals on improving standards in public life.
The Government decided not to move a formal motion seeking to appoint
the body without any discussion.
Such a move would have been blocked by Labour's Brian Sedgemore
(Hackney South and Shoreditch), who on Friday shouted ''object'' when a
similar motion came up for approval.
Last night, he again shouted his objection, though this proved
unnecessary as at the same time the Government made clear its decision
not to move the motion.
This increases the chances of a debate since the proposed 11-strong
cross-party Select Committee on Standards in Public Life must produce
its interim report by July 7, allowing time for a Commons debate before
the summer break.
The Government's decision by the Government sparked a flurry of points
of order from Tories.
Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford), one of those nominated for the
committee, urged Deputy Speaker Dame Janet Fookes: ''We have to resolve
this.''
Otherwise objections would mean that the committee would never happen
''and the public outside will want to know why'', Mr Duncan-Smith added.
Former Minister Patrick McLoughlin (Derbyshire West) said the
committee needed to report by a certain date and suggested the chair had
''some responsibility to the chamber''.
Mr Oliver Heald (Hertfordshire North) asked when the Government could
bring forward a motion ''to have this matter cleared up''.
However, Dame Janet ruled it was a matter for Ministers.
Earlier, at Question Time, Mr Denis MacShane (Rotherham -- Lab.)
criticised the committee's composition when he said four of six Tories
named had 23 paid directorships or consultancies between them.
Mr MacShane said: ''A Daily Telegraph Gallup opinion poll today shows
that nine out of 10 members of the public do not want MPs to take any
outside payment of any sort.''
Public Services Minister David Hunt told him: ''I do hope the Commons
will get on with setting up the relevant committee to look into the way
the Commons will respond to the recommendations of the Nolan Committe.''

SCOTLAND'S first election rerun could be ordered tomorrow when a
sheriff is expected to give his ruling.
The re-run was demanded in a civil action by Labour candidate Mrs
Moira Fitzpatrick, who lost the Laurmont ward in Falkirk by one vote in
the recent unitary authority elections.
The seat was won by Tory Mr Frank Hodge after five recounts. However,
two ballot papers in favour of Mrs Fitzpatrick had been rejected because
they had not been franked by returning staff.
Mrs Fitzpatrick lodged an action at Falkirk Sheriff Court, calling for
her to be declared the victor or for there to be a re-run of the
election.
At yesterday's hearing, the two candidates plus returning officer Mr
Douglas Sinclair agreed that the election should be run again. However,
the decision rests with Sheriff Principal John Maguire, who will give
his ruling tomorrow.
Mrs Fitzpatrick's petition comes under the 1983 Representation of the
People Act and claims that ''acts or omissions'' by the returning
officer and his staff affected the result.
A similar action is in front of Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson at
Jedburgh. Liberal Democrat Ms Pat Miller was beaten by one vote by
Independent Mr Tom Dobson after four recounts in the Southdean ward of
the new Borders unitary authority.
Two papers cast in her favour were thrown out because they did not
bear the official frank mark.

MPs ACCUSED Serious Fraud Office director George Staple yesterday of
involvement in what they claimed was the misleading of Parliament over a
high-profile City fraud trial.
Mr Staple came under attack at a hearing of the Treasury and Civil
Service Select Committee over allegations he conducted a secret
plea-bargaining deal to keep businessman Roger Levitt out of prison.
However, Mr Staple firmly denied the accusations.
Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell told the Commons after the Levitt
trial that ''no offers were made by the Crown to Mr Levitt''.
However, some Labour committee members insisted a deal was done and
claimed Parliament was misled.
Mr Levitt was sentenced to 180 hours' community service in November
1993 after initially facing 62 criminal charges following the collapse
of his investment empire.The SFO reduced the charges to 22 and then
agreed to drop all but one -- that of misleading a City watchdog.
Labour MPs Brian Sedgemore (Hackney South and Shoreditch), Mike
O'Brien (Warwickshire North) and Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke
Newington) claimed a plea-bargaining deal had been worked out with the
SFO to ensure Mr Levitt would receive a non-custodial sentence.
However, Mr Staples told the committee he was surprised by the
non-custodial sentence Mr Levitt received and did not know about any
non-custodial plea-bargaining discussions.

A SHERIFF officer admitted carrying out an ''exercise of fear'' while
attempting to poind the possessions of a quadriplegic yesterday.
The admission came when Mr Grant Campbell, an officer with the Glasgow
firm, Stirling Park, was confronted by friends of wheelchair-bound Mr
Willie Ross.
Mr Campbell had arrived to carry out a poinding at the house in Law
Drive, Newarthill, Lanarkshire, due to Mr Ross's #1400 poll tax arrears.
When Mr Ross's friend, Mr Tommy Mackin, confronted the sheriff officer
and demanded: ''This is an exercise of fear, isn't it?'', Mr Campbell
replied: ''Obviously.''
The poinding was delayed for a week after Mr Ross agreed to undergo a
DSS means test and arrange a payment scheme from his income support
cash.
After the officers had left, the shaken former Ravenscraig steel
worker said: ''It's outrageous that he had the arrogance to say
something like that. A poinding is a very stressful thing to face up
to.''
He had feared that the sheriff's men would poind the Motability
Vauxhall Astra he drives one-handed. However, Mr Ross informed the
officers that the vehicle belonged to Motability, not him.
Mr Ross, 57, was left wheelchair bound after a swimming pool accident
on the honeymoon of his second marriage six years ago. His wife, Sarah,
46, quit her job as a shop assistant to provide full-time care.
Mr Ross said: ''I'm living on the poverty line and now that they are
going to take this money from me, even if it is as little as #2 a week,
I'll be below the poverty line. Had I known I was to suffer this kind of
indignity, I would have been better off left to die.''
Poll tax campaigner Mrs Alice Sheridan -- mother of Militant
councillor Mr Tommy Sheridan -- said: ''That's exactly what these
poindings are, an exercise of fear.
''There is no way that the sheriff officers will recover their money
this way. All it does is force people who can't afford to take loans to
do so to pay off their poll tax.
''I think it's an absolute obscenity that this man should say
something like that to a man in Mr Ross' position.''

<TEXT>
GRAEME Souness's former wife told the High Court in London yesterday
that she found out her husband was having an affair with another woman
when a journalist told her.
Mrs Danielle Souness, 39, who was divorced from the former Rangers and
Liverpool manager last year, was giving evidence on behalf of the People
which is fighting the former footballer's claim for ''massive'' damages
over a story which branded him a ''dirty rat''.
She told Mr Justice Morland and the jury: ''It was only when a
journalist from the Sun came to do an interview with me that I found out
about his new girlfriend.
''She told me that Graeme had a lover. When I asked Graeme why he had
not told me he said he was about to get round to it but had forgotten.''
The court was told that Danielle's sons Fraser, 14, and Jordan, 10,
had also found out about Souness's girlfriend, Karen Levy now his second
wife, through the newspapers.
Mrs Souness told the court that just days after Souness was taken into
hospital for a heart bypass operation in April 1992, the boys had read
the article in a paper handed to them by a journalist.
Mrs Souness, who left Souness in November 1988, said: ''The boys were
playing outside. The press were all outside as well.
''One of the journalists handed a paper to Fraser and that's how they
found out about the whole thing.''
She added that Jordan had first met Karen several weeks before but was
unaware of the affair.
She told the court: 'I was talking to Jordan one afternoon and asked
who had been looking after him while Graeme was in hospital having
tests.
''He said that it was a lady with two children. I thought it was
perhaps a neighbour. I didn't know who it was.
''I wasn't upset because he had a girlfriend. I couldn't understand
why he didn't want to see the children or make any effort to see the
children before the operation.
''When he met Karen I thought: 'Great now he's met someone else he's
happy. Now he will leave us alone.' But in the end my impression was
that he just wants the house back. He thinks to himself: 'I have got a
new life and I just want the house back'.''
Souness is claiming libel over an article based on an interview given
by his former wife in which she alleged he ordered her, their sons, and
adopted daughter Chantelle, to leave by Christmas Eve 1992 the Surrey
home he had provided for them after their separation.
He also refused to pay the boys' school fees, she said.
Mrs Souness told the court yesterday that she felt ''physically sick''
when his lawyers served an eviction notice on her and their children.
''I couldn't understand it. I kept going over the situation. I thought
if he wanted the house for the children, why is he doing this? Why is he
taking these steps?''
She said: ''I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I didn't know what we
were going to do, what our future was.''
She claimed she was living on handouts from her parents, and that even
before the ''eviction'' she had to grovel for cash to feed and clothe
the children.
She decided to go to Majorca in February 1994 because she could not
afford to buy a property in the UK.
''Everything I owned was in Majorca and I could not sell the property
I had there. I didn't want to leave Norton Farm, it wasn't in the
children's interests, but I had no home in the UK.''
She said she was forced to take in lodgers at Norton Farm and had
successfully applied for a job at a leisure centre in Guildford.
Mrs Souness said that, after she left Norton Farm voluntarily in
February 1993, Mr Souness told her he would not pay the school fees ''as
a matter of principle''.
When she asked him how he would feel if she went to the newspapers,
she alleged he replied: ''I hope you do a story because I'll sue them
and I'll make even more money.''
She claimed he said he boasted he had #8m in the bank and asked if she
was upset that she was no longer with him.
She decided to sell her story for #15,000 because she had debts of
#12,000.
''I was unhappy at the treatment that Graeme had forced upon us in the
last two to three years. He just washed his hands of us completely.
''I thought I should set the record straight about what he was doing,
what he had done to us.''
Mr George Carman, QC, for the People, asked if she felt like a Judas
who had betrayed her former husband.
''No, I thought he had betrayed us. I thought he had let us and his
children down badly. The truth is there in black and white.''
She added: ''The phrase 'dirty rat' reflected then, and still reflects
now, my feelings towards him.''
Mrs Souness, of Penhouse Close, Bramhall, Cheshire, said she was
terrified when she received letters threatening court action if she did
not leave Norton Farm.
''That meant he meant it. It was not an empty threat.''
She said it was agreed she could stay in the house until Jordan, now
10, was 18. She refused to vary that by signing a tenancy agreement
until access to the children had been sorted out.
The situation was strained when Mr Souness refused to see her or his
children before his by-pass surgery because their paths would cross with
Karen.
''I was upset but not because he had a girlfriend. He pushed the
children out.''
Danielle admitted that she owed #300,000 to her brother Mark as a
result of failed investments and she owes her father another #200,000.
Mr Carman said: 'When she sells her property in Majorca which is
valued at around #1m, after paying off her debtors and paying
solicitors' and lawyers' fees she will be left with about #220,000.'
Earlier, Souness listened as Mr Carman described him as a hard man on
and off the football field.
''The key to the character of Graeme Souness is that he has a
reputation, perhaps well deserved, of being a hard man in football.
Unhappily, he became at that time a hard man in his life.
''He is a man who likes to be in complete control. He is prepared to,
and did, use threat after threat to be in complete control. He used not
one but three lawyers to try and retain complete control.
''Because control is what Graeme Souness is all about -- and money
also is what he is all about.''
His whole attitude could be summed up as ''he who pays the piper calls
the tune'', said the QC.
Mrs Souness left him in November 1988 because she was ''put down'' by
her husband and was losing her self respect.
''The children are made the pawns of this man's power struggle because
he can't ever tolerate not being in total control.''
Publishers MGN Ltd deny libel and say the story is true. The hearing
continues.

<TEXT>
A SERIES of one-day pit strikes planned by the National Union of
Mineworkers was outlawed by the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The court ruled that a pro-strike ballot result from NUM members last
month was past its legal ''use-by date'' by the time set for the first
stoppage -- from midnight.
Three judges confirmed a High Court injunction, granted last Friday,
banning the union from going ahead with the industrial action.
Pit owner RJB Mining had obtained the injunction to stop the NUM
ordering its members out today and on Friday, and on Mondays and Fridays
after that.
The ballot mandate was returned on May 16 and, under ''recent ballot''
rules, had to be acted on within four weeks.
Appeal judge Lord Justice Henry said the use-by date had presumably
been set on the basis that ''a month can be a very long time in
industrial relations''.
RJB's lawyers argued that the four weeks ran out at midnight last
night, making the strike call unlawful.
The NUM maintained that midnight was not only the end of yesterday but
also the beginning of today, and therefore the union could call out its
members on today's shift and still be within the limit.
Lord Justice Henry said the argument was ''ingenious'' but had to be
rejected ''for the simple reason that, while time may be seamless, days
do not overlap''.
The NUM was ordered to pay the employer's legal costs and refused
leave to appeal. It is still open to the union to petition the Law Lords
for leave.

THE three Baltic states formally joined the queue yesterday for
membership of the European Union.
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania signed association agreements with the
EU, thus recognising their ambition to become full members. They join an
already extended waiting list which includes Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Malta.
Once all are admitted, the EU's membership will have risen to 26. Mr
Maris Gailis, Latvian prime minister, said at a signing ceremony: ''The
Baltic countries have come back into Europe.''
The former Soviet states now enjoy trade and co-operation agreements
already signed with the six East European ex-communist states. Slovenia
is expected to sign a similar agreement soon.
No date has been set for any of the countries to become EU members but
Mr Adolfas Slezevicius, prime minister of Lithuania, said: ''We hope to
be able to join this century.''
The three Baltic states are the only former Soviet republics to be
eligible for European Union agreements which carry a promise of
membership. Germany, Sweden, and Finland all have strong ties to the
Baltic states and have been pressing their case. Britain also supports
eastwards expansion of the EU.
The EU has also offered partnership agreements to members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the former USSR republics, including
trade assistance and economic co-operation but not the promise of EU
membership.
Russia has not objected to EU plans to take in eastern European
countries in the way it has complained about the expansion eastwards of
Nato. However, the links between the EU and the Western European Union
(WEU) defence organisation mean Russia may be more sensitive about
Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia's joining the EU. The WEU offers members
a security guarantee which is stronger than Nato's.
The three Baltic prime ministers were at pains to assure Moscow that
their new EU links were not a snub to Russia, whose difficult
relationship with the EU is ''evolving'', in the description of Mr
Douglas Hurd, British Foreign Secretary. ''This agreement is with
Europe, not against Russia,'' Estonian premier Mr Tiit Vahi said.
Mr Gailis said the closer relationship with the EU was particularly
welcome since the Baltics' key trading partners, Sweden and Finland, had
joined this year. ''Already in five months, trade with the EU is
increasing,'' he said.
The Baltic premiers will attend the EU summit at Cannes later this
month.
EU foreign ministers again delayed signing a trade agreement with
Russia because of the continuing violence in Chechnya.
Mr Hurd said: ''We agreed the EU-Russian interim trade agreement
should be signed as soon as possible but not today. It might be done
before July or in July, depending on the situation in Chechnya.''
Mr Hurd said EU Ministers were concerned at events in Chechnya.
Britain is thought to favour signing the deal to bring a warming of
relations with Russia, while some other member states want to use the
promised benefits of the agreement as an incentive to Moscow to take a
more ameliorative line with the Chechen rebels.

A DUNDEE mother hit out at gang violence and bullying yesterday at the
launch of the Barnardo Facts of Life report.
From her home in a graffiti-daubed tenement in Dundee's Mill O'Mains
scheme, Mrs June Jenkins spoke of her fears for her nine-year-old son
Daniel.
Daniel, who suffers from behavioural problems, has been attacked by
gangs and threatened with a pool cue while out playing.
Unemployed Mrs Jenkins, 38, said teenagers hung about in her close,
making life a misery for her family.
She said: ''There's far too much vandalism and bullying these days.
''I fear for the future of my son -- the outlook is too bleak. I had a
job when I left school but there will be nothing for Daniel in Dundee
when he is older.''
Mrs Jenkins claimed it was not safe for her son to go out in an area
plagued by vandals and gangs.
She explained: ''Daniel was dragged over a bridge by a 16-year-old and
he was threatened with a pool cue. It's not safe for him to go out.''
The worried mother agrees with the findings of the Barnardo report.
She said: ''Everything's different compared to when I was a girl.
There were gangs but nothing like now.
''Life was a lot better when I was young. There wasn't so much
violenece.''
She added: ''Now teenagers hang about our close every night and we've
had our windows smashed.
''It's a tough world for children these days.''

YOUNGSTERS have never had it so bad as at present, according to two
new surveys published today.
One survey shows that more than 50% of fathers spend less than five
minutes alone with their children on weekdays. The other reveals that
most adults think children face a less caring world in the 1990s than
the one they grew up in.
Factors cited include increased crime and violence, higher
unemployment, a greater likelihood of being poor, and the break-up of
the traditional family.
The views of more than 1000 adults across the UK, including 100 in
Scotland, were canvassed by Mori for the children's charity Barnardo's.
Almost two-thirds of Scottish respondents said that today's children
had a worse deal than past generations, with 83% believing that
youngsters had a lower chance of permanent work and 62% saying that job
fulfilment was less likely.
Almost 90% of adults think children will witness more crime and
violence in society, and nearly three-quarters of the sample said
schools were more likely to experience bullying.
Seven out of 10 believe children are less likely to have a stable
family life, and more than half think a loving home is also an unlikely
prospect. Family meals have decreased, said 75%, and the majority also
reported a decline in family activities.
One of the few bright spots in the survey relates to health, where 55%
think today's children are likely to be fitter. However, that appears to
be the result of medical advances, since most adults think the level of
exercise has decreased, and diet has not improved.
Mr Hugh Mackintosh, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: ''The
findings of this survey paint a depressing picture of adults' perception
of the future for today's children.
''Since we work in some of the poorest communities, it is no surprise
that the parents we encounter are very concerned about their children's
future. What is alarming, and is now evident from this survey, is that a
cross-section of adults from various social groups share these concerns.
''We need to start listening to children, addressing their fears and
giving them real hope, with jobs and training.''
Meanwhile, a survey carried out by NOP shatters the image of the
caring nineties' man who spends time with his family above all else.
Rather than play with his child, it finds, he is much more likely to
play sport or pursue hobbies. As a result, youngsters are often left to
their own devices, watching at least two hours' TV a day.
The survey, of more than 500 fathers, shows those with over-10s are
likely to spend even less time each day contributing towards their
child's development.
Of those with children under 15, almost three in 10 say sports or
other hobbies are their most important leisure activity against one in
four who put youngsters first. Just 3% mention time spent with their
wife or partner.
The picture is even bleaker when fathers of children of all ages are
included, with many preferring to make time for themselves.
Twice as many fathers say sport is more important than time with their
children (22% against 11%), with 18% preferring DIY or gardening above
all else.
Asked to estimate how much time they spend one-to-one with their child
on an average weekday, 54% said less than five minutes. Of these, 15%
said they spent no time at all, 28% said one to two minutes, and 11%
said three to five minutes.
Men with children aged between 10 and 15 spent even less time. Almost
half (45%) spent only one to two minutes and 14% spent no time with
those aged between 10 and 15.
Almost two-thirds (61%) felt there were no barriers preventing them
from building a closer relationship. Those who felt there were barriers
blamed time and work pressures (21% and 14%) respectively.
The results coincide with the launch of a new book for fathers
juggling family and career, The Sixty-Minute Father, by Rob Parsons.

THE Government last night narrowly beat off a challenge in the Lords
to its US-style ''no win, no fee'' plans, allowing lawyers south of the
Border to increase charges in successful cases -- an option available in
some situations in Scotland. However, Ministers faced fierce criticism
from lawyers led by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, who
condemned the proposed 100% increase as ''outrageous'' and warned that
this ''alien creature should not be allowed to run amok''. Prominent
solicitor Labour's Lord Mishcon said: ''This is eroding the dignity of
the profession and their traditions. I don't want that to happen to my
profession. I don't want to be turned into a bookie.''

THE fisheries protection vessel HMS Alderney was last night alongside
the redundant North Sea installation Brent Spar as it was towed to its
deep-water grave stalked by two Greenpeace vessels.
Greenpeace has pledged to do all it can to prevent the dumping of the
platform. A spokeswoman said the activists were all volunteers who,
though they might put themselves at risk, would try to avoid putting
others in danger.
She said the Moby Dick, which played a key role in the hijacking of
the deserted Brent Spar before its journey to the sinking site 150 miles
off western Scotland, had been joined by the Altair, a Dutch-registered
vessel with a helideck and accommodation for 42.
On board the Altair last night, Greenpeace activist Mr Simon Reddy
said they were documenting the events to show that Shell and the British
Government were ''the dirty men of Europe''.
He said the flotilla was headed by the Brenda Viking followed by two
tugs and then the Brent Spar. At the rear were two supply ships and then
some way behind was HMS Alderney. Another supply ship was ''shadowing''
the Altair.
HMS Alderney has been sent to the scene at the request of the
Department of Trade and Industry to monitor events.
Mr Reddy said Greenpeace would give Shell every opportunity to reverse
its decision and take Brent Spar ashore to deal with it in a responsible
manner.

* In the Lords yesterday, peers challenged the Government on plans to
dispose of disused offshore oil structures in the open sea.
Government spokesman Lord Inglewood put figures on the comparative
costs, stating that in the case of Brent Spar the cost of dismantling
on-shore would be about #45m compared with deep-water disposal costs of
about #11m.
He told the House there were certain circumstances in which the most
environmentally benign way of dealing with the problem was disposal in
the deep ocean.
He also said that it was likely to be six times more dangerous to
dismantle onshore.

21st term in custody -- for stealing a pair of boots from a nurse's
locker at Stirling Royal Infirmary.
Haney, of Drip Road, admitted the theft when she appeared from custody
at the town's sheriff court. Her boyfriend, Angus Cowan, 21, of the same
address, was also jailed for 60 days when he admitted stealing five
bandages, two ashtrays, and a packet of buscuits from the hospital.
The court was told that Haney had gone to the hospital complaining
about eye and back injuries.
She claimed she had been beaten up after publicity three weeks ago,
when her mother had complained that a sheriff at Stirling had branded
her children a family from hell.
Seventeen stone ''Big Mags'' Haney had spoken out after Sheriff Norrie
Stein remarked of the Haneys: ''What troubles me is the misery that this
particular family has inflicted on the Raploch community over many many
years.''
However, her daughter Diane, one of seven surviving children, is the
only one never to have been given youth custody or imprisoned.
Stella Haney and Cowan were seen acting suspiciously in a day room in
the hospital.
Police were called when a nurse found her #100 boots were missing.
Haney and Cowan were arrested after police using the town centre
closed-circuit TV system spotted Haney in the street wearing the stolen
boots.

EDINBURGH citizens can look forward to being able to choose an
environmentally friendly woodland grave within a year.
Demand for such resting places is growing rapidly throughout the UK
and the district council hopes to become the first local authority in
Scotland to provide them.
After a woodland burial, a small tree is usually planted instead of
erecting a gravestone and the remainder of the grave covered by
bluebells and wild flowers.
In the areas set aside, small forests are created and the area is
managed for the benefit of wildlife.
The council is seeking land for a cemetery and has agreed to set aside
part of it to be used for woodland burials.
If this project is judged to be taking too long, environmental
services chiefs plan to create an area for woodland graves in one of the
cemeteries already owned by the council. The cemetery in Corstorphine is
a possibility.
Councillor John Allan, vice-chairman of the district council's
environmental services committee, said: ''People are becoming more
environmentally aware and are asking that consideration be given to this
most sensitive area.
''The council has undertaken many environmental initiatives and I
believe this one will prove very popular with those people who like the
idea of leaving a tree and a patch of flowers as their last memorial.''
Mr David Watson, the council's head of public health services, said
inquiries about woodland burials had been received when the matter was
first discussed by the environmental services committee last year.
District council officials had visited Carlisle City Council which was
recognised as being in the forefront of environmentally friendly
burials. Some other public and privately-owned cemeteries were now
offering green burials in England but he was not aware of any other
councils in Scotland offering such a service.
A council official in Carlisle confirmed that, in the two years since
the authority had established the woodland burial ground, 61 out of the
96 sites had been sold at #176 each.

HOPES of finding three missing fishermen were fading last night after
an intensive air and sea search failed to find any trace of the friends.
Father-of-two Andrew Sparks, 24, and his fishing pals, brothers Mr Tom
Davies, 36, and Mr Les Davies, 34, left Lyme Regis harbour, Dorset, on
Sunday morning to fish for pollock.
The alarm was raised in the early hours of yesterday when the trio
failed to return home. A search was mounted involving a Nimrod aircraft,
warships, lifeboats, and helicopters.
Mr David Harding, acting district controller of Portland coastguard,
said: ''Sadly, we've had no results so far but we continue to hope that
our operation will reveal their whereabouts or some information.''
Rescuers were told there were no flares or radio equipment on the 14ft
vessel and only one lifejacket.
The search area covers almost 1000 square nautical miles of the
Channel.

A SCOTS sheriff yesterday told an international law conference in
Scotland that he had no difficulty when it came to dealing with child
abusers -- ''I always lock them up.''
Sheriff Robin McEwan, QC, who is also one of the country's temporary
High Court judges, said that, where he operated, if he were to do
anything other than that, the public would be ''scandalised''.
He said that, unless it was ''minor, happened only once and never
repeated'' he operated entirely on the theory of punishment and
retribution for offences which could only be ''wanton and inexcusable''.
Sheriff McEwan, a former sheriff at Lanark and now sheriff at Ayr, was
speaking on the second day of the International Bar Association
conference in Edinburgh.
He was taking part in a session on sentencing of young people and
those who offend against them as part of the conference debate ''Grim
tales: children in crime''.
''If a question of sentencing of child abusers arises in my court, I
have no difficulty with that,'' he told IBA delegates. ''I always lock
them up''.
Stating that it was in the public interest, he told them --''I start
from the top by considering only imprisonment.''
Sheriff McEwan said he ''quite unashamedly'' maintained that he had to
be persuaded to do otherwise ''by fairly fierce and vehement advocacy''
if child abusers were to avoid the due process of law.
''I am afraid my experience is that, if you do not do that, they will
be back the following week doing it again.''
Sheriff McEwan, in a discussion of cases of child abuse allegations
where youngsters are removed from their homes and put into places of
safety, praised social workers.
''I have to say that they do not bring these matters before me
lightly. They just don't do it out of badness or out of fun.
''They do it after a lot of heart-searching, care and consideration.
They do not remove children from their parents into places of safety
without a great deal of thought and trouble taken.''
The sheriff also said it was his experience that, when the time arose
to re-integrate children back with their parents social workers did
everything they possibly could to make it work and to follow it up
afterwards where they could.
At an earlier session, a senior UK police officer called for fair
treatment from the courts of child victims, including protection by
judges.
Mr Tony Butler, Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Constabulary, said
what was needed was a system that allowed justice to be done for
children as well as justice being done for the accused.
He criticised oppressive questioning of child victims by defence
lawyers. ''This is lazy advocacy. It can do a child in,'' said Mr
Butler, who highlighted one incident where an 11 year-old girl stood for
four-and-half hours in the witness box.
He said the first question from the defence was -- ''You are doing it
for the money so that you can go to Disneyland. Did you know you will
only get paid out (compensation) if the defendant is found guilty?''
Mr Butler said the system needed a cultural change so that children
were not treated as ''nuisances''.

<HEADLINE>Record #22.5m win marred by dispute Estranged wife attacks husband, demanding half his lottery share</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE sweet taste of success was already starting to turn sour last
night for one of the UK's latest National Lottery multi-millionaires.
Double-glazing businessman Mark Gardiner popped the champagne corks
after sharing a record #22.5m jackpot with business partner Paul
Maddison.
However, before the glasses were filled, Mr Gardiner's estranged wife
was reportedly demanding half his share of the cash -- and he was
fending off reporters' questions about the way he had allegedly treated
his family.
Mr Gardiner, 33, of St Leonard's-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, said
he was upset by the reported comments of estranged wife, Kim, and his
adoptive mother Irene Cresswell. He described some of the things written
about him in morning newspaper reports as ''very sad''.
He also refused to discuss allegations -- made by his wife and
reported in the Sun -- that he was a ''drunken, violent womaniser''.
Nor would he comment on an interview with Mrs Cresswell, in which she
was quoted as saying: ''I hope he drinks himself to death with his
money.''
''It's very sad some of the things that have been written about me,''
said Mr Gardiner. ''If you went to Hastings and spoke to my real friends
you would get a completely different story.''
Mr Gardiner's wife told the Sun that she was divorcing Mr Gardiner on
the grounds of his ''cruelty, unreasonable behaviour, and adultery''.
She was quoted as saying she felt she was entitled to ''half his
cash'' because he had allegedly ''never paid anything towards me or our
two-year-old daughter Jessica''.
His adoptive mother added that he ''didn't deserve a penny'' of the
money.
Neither of the women was available for comment last night.
Mr Gardiner and Mr Maddison, 45, also from St Leonard's, said the
reality of their bonanza had yet to sink in.
They said they aimed to go back to work later this week and hoped
their decision to opt for publicity would stop them being constantly
hounded by the press. The pair said they spent more than #20-a-week on
National Lottery tickets, picking numbers at random in their office.
They discovered the record win only when Mr Gardiner went to the local
bowling green on Sunday to play a match and realised he had not checked
this week's numbers.
''I remembered the first three numbers and I knew the others were in
the 40s but it was not until I phoned Paul from the bowling green that I
knew,'' said Mr Gardiner. ''He rang back to say, 'Are you joking?'.''
The winning numbers were: 44, 15, 26, 46, 12, 49, and bonus 14.
Mr Maddison said they had no idea what they might spend the cash on,
apart from a ''new van''.
''We may take on some more staff and let them fit windows while we sit
in the office picking lottery numbers,'' added Mr Gardiner.
He also told how he had a call yesterday from his bank manager, who
was offering his services.
''We were due to discuss our overdraft,'' added Mr Gardiner. ''But I
told him we would not be renewing it.''
A legal expert last night said it was very unlikely that Mr Gardiner's
wife would be able to claim half his win.
Solicitor Diana Parker, spokeswoman for the Solicitors Family Law
Group, said the estranged wife of a man who had won millions of pounds
on the Lottery would probably receive only a relatively small portion.
''Mrs Lottery Winner would be in a very different situation to a wife
who, say, had helped her husband build up a multi-million fortune in a
business, for example,'' Miss Cooper said.
''There, the wife could argue that she had played a part in creating
the money and was entitled to a substantial share.
''Mrs Lottery Winner would be likely to get some benefit from her
husband's win on the Lottery -- but nothing like a half.''

RAIL bosses in Scotland said last night that dentists could apply to
open premises in main stations, such as the Central in Glasgow and
Waverley in Edinburgh.
There was also a chance that a medical centre would be allowed to open
as well.
The move is all part of the changing patterns envisaged by Railtrack
involving railway stations throughout Britain. As more and more people
commute, they believe travellers will spend more and more time at
stations.
The idea of being able to have their dentist or doctor at the railway
station rather than having to take time off work would, they believe,
prove to be an attractive proposition.
Such a move is part of Railtrack's attempts to get more income from
their 14 biggest stations -- two in Scotland, nine in London, and one
each in Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham. It is believed the assets of
all the stations put together would total about #2000m.
A Railtrack spokesman in Scotland said: ''Although there has not been
an application from doctors or dentists to open at stations in Edinburgh
or Glasgow, there is nothing to stop it happening.
''In fact, Central Station in Glasgow and Waverley Station in
Edinburgh are listed buildings in prime sites in the cities. Commercial
space in such places is at a premium.
''There is nothing to stop a professional group coming into such a
site. Both stations are involved in the renaissance of their respective
city centres and new developments at the station would be of benefit.''
Railtrack has appointed Mr Peter Monaghan to head the development
plans to maximise the potential of the 14 stations. Mr Monaghan, a
senior executive with 10 years' retail industry experience, will look at
ways to generate more income.

FUNDING cuts put the future of St Andrew's College in Bearsden --
responsible for Roman Catholic teacher education in Scotland -- in
doubt, it was claimed yesterday.
The college is in the Clydebank and Milngavie constituency of Labour
MP Tony Worthington, who has accused the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council of harming the institution's prospects by putting the
burden of Government grant reductions on teacher training.
The college Principal, Professor Bart McGettrick, confirmed yesterday
that the institution planned a reduction in academic staff from 91 to 63
in 1998. It also plans to reduce support staff by 25 in the same period.
Professor McGettrick said: ''We are going through a dramatic change in
higher education generally. This is particularly true of teacher
education in Scotland and, in a college where the primary concern is
teacher education, the effects are fairly stark.''
St Andrew's is one of three teacher training institutions to receive
safety-net funding.
However, the funding council has told it that it must produce business
plans which will eliminate dependency on safety-netting in the future.
It will receive safety net money for 1995-6 only if it produces plans to
enable it to be run without such support after next year.
St Andrew's, Moray House Institute of Education in Edinburgh, and
Northern College of Education, with campuses in Aberdeen and Dundee, are
due to receive a total of more than #1.8m in safety netting, with the
Glasgow college being allocated the lion's share, #904,000.
The vice-principal of Northern College, Dr David Northcroft, said the
institution anticipated going into the next year with between eight and
12 fewer staff to meet the safety-net requirements.
Mr Douglas Gillespie, personnel officer at Moray House, said any
voluntary redundancies could be achieved within existing programmes.
Professor McGettrick said he wanted to ensure that the college's plans
did not affect the quality of work by staff.
However, Mr Worthington wondered how the college could serve the needs
of the Catholic education system -- which is guaranteed by statute --
when the funding council's actions put such pressure on it.
In a letter to the council's chief executive, Professor John Sizer, he
also wondered how standards could be maintained when staff were to be
made redundant but increases in student numbers were expected.
He also wanted to know why colleges received a smaller tuition fee
from the Government for students on primary teacher courses than for
those on secondary ones.
An official for the council said it would be premature to discuss the
consequences of redundancies because the final action plan had not yet
been received.
The Government, and not the council, set tuition fee levels, she said.

JUNIOR doctor Paul Scott changed his career to go into medicine,
having graduated in law, and finds he has been working, on average, a
72-hour week as an anaesthetist at Stirling Royal Infimary.
His hospital trust is one of those working with the Scottish Office on
the review of doctors' hours, and the move is welcomed by the young
medic who travels to work in Stirling from his home in Edinburgh, every
day.
He said yesterday: ''I think we all welcome the expansion in the field
of new consultants' posts. It is a step forward, and I appreciate the
fact that my own trust has been involved in an audit for the last
month.''
He admits that he does not work 72 hours a week ''on his feet'',
because he can have time off when necessary, unless called to deal with
emergencies.
Dr Scott, 29, and a bachelor, says there is no doubt that married
colleagues would have difficulty spending time with their families and
friends because of the difficulty of working extra hours, and being on
call.
For him, a typical day is a 9am start, often not leaving the hospital
where he works until 1am the next day. He said: ''In the past I have
worked, like others, 100 hours a week, without taking holiday
allocation.''
The result, he concedes, is that morale has been appalling in the
medical profession.
He explained: ''It is all very well to say that pay for doctors is
good, and I would not argue about that, but it makes no difference when
hours such as we have been asked to work must be covered.''
The biggest problems facing junior doctors, he felt, were in the
paediatric, obstetric, and geriatric areas.
He said: ''I am sure we all welcome the consultant expansion. It is
undoubtedly a step in the right direction.''

MANAGEMENT and union officials held talks at a company in Dundee
yesterday after workers were told that the plant's future was at risk if
they did not accept wage and job cuts.
All 300 workers at transformer manufacturers ABB Power T &amp; D, have
been sent a letter by their employers warning of a ''drastic''
cost-cutting survival package after an ''unacceptable'' loss which puts
the operation's future ''in serious jeopardy''.
The cuts include a drop in wages and some redundancies. The measures
affect both white-collar and blue-collar workers.
The package also involves plans for employees to work overtime at the
basic rate of pay.
In the letter, Mr Robert Hill, general manager at ABB, part of a
Swedish and Swiss conglomerate, said: ''It is regrettable that this
action is required -- particularly as it includes further redundancies
and the reductions in employee costs.
''However, the current level of loss is wholly unacceptable to ABB.''
He warned workers that failure to support the measures ''will
certainly jeopardise the future''.
Mr Hill added: ''If we work together we can ensure that the tradition
of transformer production continues in Dundee for the future. If we
don't, the prospect looks very bleak indeed.''
Management were locked in talks with the AEEU engineering union for
most of the day.
The union has put forward suggestions and the two sides will meet
again on Thursday.

PLANS were announced yesterday to open up the management and
maintenance of Scotland's roads to the private sector.
From April next year the country will be divided into eight parts.
Three premium networks, Clyde, Forth, and Tay will cover the main
motorway and dual carriageway routes and will be offered on five-year
contracts.
This replaces the existing system where regional councils, which cease
to function next April, carry out most road maintenance work. The
remaining five sectors will be the subject of three-year contracts and
local councils will be invited to provide routine and winter
maintenance.
An audit group will monitor performance of the contracts.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the proposals would provide better
value for money for the taxpayer.
''They will provide increased opportunities to harness the best
available management, technical, and financial skills through the
competition process to maximise the quality of service given to road
users as customers,'' he said.
The plans were welcomed by the Automobile Association which said
private sector expertise would offer benefits to motorists, but the
experience of local authorities in maintenance work would not be lost.
All contracts will be open to both bidders from the public and private
sectors. A traffic controller is also to be appointed to operate
motorway control systems.
Regional councils at present carry out maintenance work on trunk roads
on an agency basis.
The Scottish Office said it recognised the implications of the
proposals for regional council staff involved and was working with
councils to protect the interests of those who have a right of transfer
to new organisations.
There was also recognition of the benefits of allowing prospective
private sector operators to sub-contract specialist maintenance to local
authority workers.

Yard's buyer promises 'hundreds' of jobs
TYNESIDE was celebrating last night after a new owner was secured for
Swan Hunter, its last shipyard.
The deal enabling the THC Group to take over the Wallsend yard on the
River Tyne was clinched just in time to prevent the go-ahead of an
auction of its equipment planned for next week.
It was agreed exactly 25 months after the internationally famous
warship builder went into receivership on failing to win a Royal Navy
helicopter carrier contract needed to keep it afloat.
Over the next 18 months it was progressively run down as the final
frigates on its order book were completed. Since the last went late last
year hopes of finding a new owner had seemed almost completely
extinguished.
Although the yard will now be coming back to life it will be in a very
different form, with THC planning to use it to build floating production
vessels for the offshore oil and gas industry.
Also, while Swan Hunter employed more than 2200 when it went into
receivership, the new owners are talking of hundreds of jobs, with the
prospect of workers being paid off between contracts as normal in the
offshore business.
However, with two other Swan Hunter yards already taken over by ship
repairers -- Neptune went to A and P Appledore and Hebburn Dry Dock to
Tees Dockland Ltd -- the blow of the old yard's shutdown has been
softened.
THC, based at Hartlepool, Cleveland, but Dutch-owned, is not saying
how much the yard is costing. Commercial manager Mr Glen Wilson told a
news conference only that it ''intends to create a number of very
worthwhile jobs''.
Later in a radio interview he confirmed he was talking about hundreds
of jobs but stressed: ''I use the term loosely because our industry is
quite cyclical and there are certain ups and downs.''
It was stressed THC could not say much about the future as the deal
has had to be rushed through in 10 days to head off the auction of
fittings and fixtures, which is now cancelled.
However, although the details will be announced later there was
general euphoria on Tyneside that the long campaign to keep some form of
shipbuilding industry on the river had ended successfully.
Newcastle East MP Nick Brown said: ''I welcome today's decision
because while it doesn't save the old Swan Hunter that we knew it gives
Tyneside a fighting chance to survive as a shipbuilding community.''
Tyne and Wear Development Corporation chief executive Mr Alastair
Balls said: ''This is good news for Tyneside. THC has an excellent track
record.''
He stressed the Government-established corporation had worked closely
with THC in the preparation of its business plan, advised it on applying
for Department of Trade and Industry grant aid and had also pledged
#500,000 towards the capital cost.
Swan Hunter union campaign co-ordinator Mr Eddie Darke said: ''We
welcome THC with open arms. It will bring prosperity and jobs back to
Wallsend.''
He understood up to 600 jobs would be created at peak periods. ''Those
jobs are badly needed in Wallsend. It is great news by anyone's
standards.''

THE EGG has joined the fight against housebreaking. Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie, the Scottish Office Minister of State, yesterday described it
as ''humble'' when he launched a #300,000 campaign but said the egg
would play a novel role.
Eggs were selling in Scottish shops yesterday printed with one of two
messages: ''Is your home as easy to break into?'' or ''Let's crack
housebreaking''.
For the next fortnight, half of the eggs sold in Scotland will be
printed with these messages.
Ink-jet printers, which place ''freshness dates'' on eggs, will be
used to add the messages to an estimated 2.8 million eggs, and it is
hoped to reach 180,000 households a week.
Lord Fraser observed: ''This is an 'eggcellent' way of promoting the
initiative.''
He said housebreaking offences fell by 10% in 1994, after a fall of
14% in 1993. However, although the trend was downwards, the figures were
still unacceptably high.
Housebreaking was a serious crime, well worth devoting time and effort
to reducing.
''It is a crime people fear, something which can cause distress far
beyond the value of what has been stolen, so we owe it to the public to
tackle it,'' he said.
The campaign will use radio and cinema advertising to emphasise the
message that basic security is vital to prevent homes being easy
pickings for housebreakers.
Scottish Office statistics published in April showed that
housebreaking crimes fell from 116,103 in 1991 to 88,394 in 1994. The
1994 figures, which sub-divided housebreaking into domestic and other
property for the first time, showed that 60% of cases involved houses,
garages, and garden sheds.

THE report of the public inquiry into the Monklands affair will be
released next Monday.
Professor Robert Black, QC, who conducted the independent inquiry into
allegations of corruption in Monklands district, will deliver the report
in person to council headquarters in Coatbridge.
0 There was speculation last night that individual councillors would
come in for criticism for the method and manner in which they conducted
council business.
Professor Black will also make copies of the report available to the
press.
Personal delivery sidesteps an awkward situation that would arise if
the report was posted to the council offices.
In that event, the council's chief executive would have to call a
council meeting to discuss the report, which would in effect mean that
the council would see the report before anyone else.
The report was commissioned for #50,000 by the council, besieged over
the past four years with allegations of spending bias towards Coatbridge
to the detriment of neighbouring Airdrie.
It was also hounded by accusations of nepotism and sectarianism in its
affairs.
Local Labour MPs Helen Liddell and Tom Clarke helped persuade the
council to fund the inquiry to clear the air.
Professor Black heard at the inquiry that it was councillors
themselves who often did the hiring and firing.
He took evidence in private and at a public hearing.
At close of the public inquiry, he said his report might not please
everyone but it would not be a whitewash.

TWO DRIVERS died and another was injured yesterday after three lorries
-- including a motorway maintenance warning truck -- were involved in a
crash near Lockerbie on the M74 yesterday afternoon about a mile south
of Johnstone Bridge.
One of the drivers who died was at the wheel of his motorway
maintenance warning lorry and trailer when it was involved in an initial
collision with an articulated lorry. The driver of the articulated lorry
also died.
It is believed that both these lorries then collided with the third
vehicle -- a motorway survey lorry. The driver of the third lorry and
one other person were injured.
A spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway police said last night: ''The
driver of the third lorry and one other person are believed to have
received relatively minor injuries and were taken to a surgery in
Lockerbie for treatment.
''Details of the drivers involved will not be released until relatives
have been informed. However, they are not believed to stay in the
Dumfries and Galloway area.''
Two of the three lanes of the southbound carriageway were closed for
about four hours.
In Barrhead, a 21-year-old man, Michael Hoey, of Roland Crescent,
Newton Mearns, died yesterday when his motorcycle was involved in a
collision with a Mercedes van on Aurs Road at about 4.10pm.
Police last night appealed to any witnesses to contact Meiklewood Road
police station.
Meanwhile, a teenager killed in an accident near Gifford on Sunday has
been named as George Murray, 17, of Robin's Neuk, Macmerry, East
Lothian.
He was killed when the Ford Escort in which he was the front seat
passenger left the Haddington-Gifford road and hit a tree. The driver,
also aged 17, suffered minor injuries.
Three rear seat passengers: Charisse Allison 14, of Earn Road,
Kirkcaldy who suffered multiple fractures, Elizabeth Soutar 14, of
Westwood Avenue, Kirkcaldy and James Thomson, 15, of Macmerry, are being
treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
* Sports car maker Porsche last night ordered its own investigation
into a horrific demonstration drive crash which killed two men and a
young woman motorist.
But the company's British managing director defended the use of public
roads to demonstrate high-performance vehicles.
The #55,000 Porsche Carrera collided head-on with a Renault 5 near
Llyswen village, Powys, on Sunday.
A 29-year-old Porsche sales executive and a businessman from Devon,
had set off in the sports car from Llangoed Hall Hotel. It is still
unclear who was behind the wheel of the car, which has a top speed of
150mph.
They were in head-on collision with Karen Dalley, 22, an assistant
manager.
Inspector John Evans said a full investigation was continuing. ''It
would appear that speed was a contributory factor,'' he added.

MORE than 50 Thatcherite Tories will face the Prime Minister this
afternoon to intensify pressure on him to stick with his Euro-sceptic
line.
The Fresh Start group will present Mr Major with a threat and a
promise: if he continues with his Euro-sceptic line he will not face a
leadership election in the autumn.
He is faced with not so much a ''stalking horse'' for the leadership
as a ''stalking idea'' as presented by his ex-Chancellor Norman Lamont.
Today, the 50 or more members of Fresh Start will intensify the
pressure on him to maintain his stated view, that Britain may never find
it necessary to join a single European currency.
The group is scheduled to meet Mr Major in his room at the Commons
this afternoon to exploit the embarrassing performance on the European
issue by Baroness Thatcher, launching her second volume of memoirs, The
Path To Power.
Yesterday, Lady Thatcher in a series of promotional interviews
denounced Mr Major's Maastricht Treaty deal and insisted that a single
currency would destroy the ultimate sovereignty of the British
Parliament.
She revealed that she agreed to Britain's disastrous joining of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism when she was Prime Minister only
because the whole of the rest of her Cabinet, including her Chancellor
John Major, was in favour.
Today, the Prime Minister expects Fresh Start to again demand that he
renounces a single currency now and if he cannot do that, establish that
there will be a referendum on the issue.
He will quote to the Euro-sceptics his speech last March standing firm
on the view that his Maastricht-negotiated opt-out puts Britain in the
best situation to decide if, and when, a single currency actually comes
about.
Both sides for today's meeting are aware of this -- but the Fresh
Starters' are determined to give the Prime Minister a coded and polite
warning of their growing strength on the Tory back benches.
Their hero, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo is there for them to
back, should it come to a leadership election in November. One member of
the group said last night: ''It will be carrot and stick as far as we
are concerned -- only now the stick will have nails in it.''
The Stalking Idea is becoming the new buzz word on the Tory benches,
emanating from Mr Lamont who over the past fortnight has stonewalled
suggestions that he might put himself forward as a candidate for Tory
leadership.
Mr Major will be told tomorrow by the group that, if he wavers on his
new Euro-sceptic line, they have organised several embarrassing meetings
and speeches for the Tory Party annual conference in October.
The Thatcher book has provided a new platform for the Euro-sceptics to
maintain their momentum, which, they claim, is represented by Tory
constituency organisations throughout the country.
At the same time, they are aware that Lady Thatcher was saying in
public yesterday what she has been saying in private for the last two
years -- she is totally against a Tory leadership election this autumn.
She said: ''I hope we will not have a leadership election. I have been
through it. It is most destabilising. I don't think it should be
possible while we have a Prime Minister in office. That should be
decided by rather more than the membership in Parliament of the
Conservative Party.''
However, she returned to her notorious ''No, No, No'' to further
European integration, which was one of the causes of her demise as the
Tory leader and Prime Minister with a Commons majority of 93.
She complains that Mr Major, her chosen successor, had turned this
into ''Yes, Yes''. There is much irritation throughout Tory ranks that
Lady Thatcher has reopened this divisive wound.
''I am absolutely against a single currency,'' she stated ''it is a
gross derogation of British sovereignty. You can never again print your
own currency or be responsible for managing it'' she declared. And then
she added: ''I think there are people in Cabinet who share my view.''
No 10 and the whole of the Whitehall system have been ordered not to
react to this controversial media blitz.
Last night at the Commons, Tory MPs on all sides of the argument --
and the Prime Minister will have to have a meeting in due course with
the Tory Euro fanatics -- were down-playing Lady Thatcher's
book-promotion intervention.
They are all more concerned about what she says concerning home
ownership and mortgage tax relief. This has struck home because of the
million plus erstwhile Tory voters who have found their homes
repossessed or plunged into bigger mortgages than their homes are worth.
In this respect, Lady Thatcher's remarks yesterday hit hard. She
demands that Mr Major must become more Conservative, restoring policies
to encourage home ownership and the family and to widen capital
ownership. ''I am afraid that it is being undermined . . . these are
true Conservative things and we must get back to Conservative policy.''
Mr Major's cuts in mortgage interest tax relief have appalled her.
''We are for home ownership, we are for reduced taxation but, alas,
three times mortgage relief has been cut on the people who trusted us
when we said we want a capital-owning democracy, we want home ownership.
They went in believing they still had that mortgage relief.''
This, she says, is the essence of the Government's unpopularity and it
is the thing that must be remedied if the Tories are to win another
General Election.

FIRST there was the Kirking of the council. Then there was added the
civic Mass. Now Glasgow is proposing to dedicate its newly-elected
unitary council at the city's central mosque later this month.
Convener of the City of Glasgow Council, Councillor Jean McFadden, was
delighted to approve the innovation after receiving a written request
from Councillor Bashir Maan, one of four Muslim members of the new
authority.
Less than delighted was Dr William Morris, minister of Glasgow
Cathedral, where the Kirking of the council has traditionally been held
until the introduction of a Civic Mass in recent years.
He said: ''If every religion represented in the city wants to have a
service, then the councillors are going to be busy.
''The Spiritualists might want a service and our Hebrew friends might
want a synagoguing. You just wonder where all this is going to end.''
He continued: ''I do think it would be a great pity if every religious
faith represented in the city felt they had to invite the councillors. I
think that would be expecting rather much of the councillors, but it's
for them to decide.''
For her part, Councillor McFadden was taken aback by Dr Morris's
response.
She declared: ''As far as I know, the Muslims believe in the same God
as Dr Morris. This is a new council with new ways and he'll just have to
live with it.
''If we have an approach from any other religion which represents a
significant section of the population of Glasgow then I'm sure our
response would be exactly the same.''
Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of Scotland's Roman Catholics, was
positive in his response. He said: ''Anything that helps towards
establishing good relationships in our multicultural community should be
welcomed.''
Councillor Maan believed the ''mosquing of the council'', as he put
it, would be a historic event.
He explained: ''I don't think it has happened in Scotland before.
Perhaps this will be another lead we can give to the rest of Britain,
because in Scotland we have always led in the field of race relations,
and particularly in Glasgow.''
The service at the mosque has been set for Friday, June 30, in the
early evening.
There will be a service for about 20 minutes, probably a reading and a
prayer, followed by refreshments, and then a guided tour of the mosque
for visitors.

<HEADLINE>#4m deal will ease burden of hard-pressed junior doctors</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977912121</RECORDNO>

SCOTLAND'S hard pressed junior doctors yesterday won a further cut in
hours with the announcement that 75 new consultants are to be appointed
in hospitals throughout the country.
Health Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said that increasing the
number of consultants' posts was recognised as the most effective way of
reducing junior doctors' hours without creating career bottlenecks.
The #4m package from the Scottish Health Service will create more than
100 jobs, including 30 posts for nursing staff, over the next year. It
is part of the New Deal on hours thrashed out between the medical
profession and Health Ministers in 1990.
The package also includes the creation of a temporary task force --
involving a consultant, junior doctor, nurse, and manager -- which will
visit hospitals where there is a problem with junior doctors' hours.
Lord Fraser said considerable progress had already been made in
reducing the number of hours worked by junior doctors: ''Hospitals have
made great strides in tackling the problem of long hours.
''Our priority now is to ensure that no junior doctor works, on
average, for more than 56 hours a week. We are working closely with
trusts to deliver this aim. This includes proper periods of resting time
for junior doctors.''
The package, which will increase the number of consultants by 3%, was
welcomed by the British Medical Association yesterday. A spokeswoman
said the association had been pressing for new consultants' posts for
some time.
''We are delighted that the Scottish Office has listened to us and is
acting on it. We hope that there won't be any delay in appointing to
these posts.''
However, the spokeswoman said the overall problem would not be solved
immediately: ''Junior doctor hours are not going to change overnight. It
is going to take a while to work through the system.''
She added that there was a long way to go before the target of 56
hours per week was achieved across the board, adding: ''There are still
a significant number of junior doctors working in excess of 72 hours a
week.
''The extra consultants are going to help but, obviously, the task
force is going to be looking around, and who knows what it will find.''
Under the New Deal, no junior doctors should have been working more
than 56 hours a week after December 31 last year. However, a Scottish
Office spokesman yesterday conceded there were still a number of trusts
which had not managed to meet the new maximum.
''No junior doctors should be working more than 56 actual hours a
week, or be contracted to work more than 72 hours a week.
''Not all of the trusts have made the 56 hours target but the extra
100 posts and the cash involved should enable hospitals everywhere to
meet it.''
A number of hospital trusts in Scotland were undertaking studies to
determine exactly how many hours junior doctors work, said the Scottish
Office. No details were available yesterday on which hospitals are
involved.
''The information on which trusts are taking part has not been
formally recorded,'' added the Scottish Office spokesman. ''We do not
know, at the centre here, which trusts are involved.''
The latest details of hours worked by doctors in Scotland's hospitals
are to be issued shortly by the Scottish Office, as part of a bi-annual
process.
However, figures obtained by The Herald show that, at the last review,
published in December 1994, the number of posts exceeding 56 hours a
week totalled 594.
Those, however, in the so-called ''hard pressed'' on-call rota,
reached a figure of 1211 of doctors working 72 hours or less.
Doctors working more than 64 hours in partial shift working totalled
145, while those working 64 hours or less reached a figure of 481.
Figures for doctors working more than 56 hours, the Scottish Office
table revealed, did not include figures from Angus Trust, Dundee
Teaching Hospitals, or the Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh.
It was confirmed last night that, among others co-operating with the
Scottish Office in the survey, are Stirling Royal Infirmary Trust, Queen
Margaret NHS Trust, Dunfermline, and the Kirkcaldy Acute NHS Trust.

HIGHLAND Regional Council yesterday issued an ultimatum that it will
go back to court again in defence of the Fort William sleeper unless
ScotRail gives assurances within the next few days that it will restore
its normal booking service for the summer.
ScotRail director John Ellis said last night that he could not agree
to the demand.
However, he will press Friday's meeting of the British Railways Board
in London for an early decision on the future of the West Highland
sleeper service and whether there is to be an appeal to the House of
Lords over the decision at the Court of Session that the service should
continue.
Mr Duncan McPherson, convener of Highland Regional Council, said last
night: ''We will be taking legal advice and will make an announcement on
Wednesday on whether we will be taking any action before Friday.''
The council's leaders met officials and legal advisers in Inverness
yesterday morning following The Herald's report on Saturday that
ScotRail was not taking bookings for the service past the end of this
month.
Mr Ellis had disclosed that reservations staff had been told to record
details of prospective passengers who would be contacted if the service
was still running next month. This is despite two recent court rulings
that the service must be maintained pending public consultation.
Mr McPherson yesterday wrote to Mr Ellis and Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang who, with other Scottish Office Ministers, is known to be unhappy
about how the British Railways Board tried to avoid public consultation.
Mr McPherson told Mr Ellis that he was astonished by ScotRail's
insensitive actions.
''At the very least, I would have expected you to have some interest
in maximising usage of the service as long as you are required to run
it.
''Instead you have chosen, by your ill-timed announcement, to
discourage passengers at the very time of the year when there is the
opportunity to generate extra tourist traffic.''
He added: ''It is vital that you act quickly to restore the damage
caused by your announcement on Friday. Please let me have your
confirmation by immediate return that bookings will be accepted
unconditionally for not less than the period of the summer timetable.''
Mr McPherson made it clear to Mr Lang, meanwhile, how seriously the
council regards the issue: ''This council will not hesitate to take
further court action should assurances not be forthcoming. It is
regrettable that we have to resort to the courts for satisfaction but
that seems to be the way of things with ScotRail at present.''
Mr Ellis, who faxed Mr McPherson his reply last night, said: ''I
recognise that this is a totally unsatisfactory situation and I will be
pressing the board for a decision on Friday, when this issue will be
discussed by the chairman.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman told The Herald yesterday: ''The letter
has been received but the Secretary of State has not yet seen it. He
will read it with interest.''
Meanwhile, the Government confirmed last night that franchise director
Roger Salmon still has not explained why he decided to axe the sleeper
and Motorail services.
Under the terms of the 1993 Railways Act, reasons for closure must be
given to the Transport Secretary.

DEVOTEES of Baroness Thatcher started queuing five hours before their
idol arrived at a London bookshop to sign copies of the second tome of
her memoirs, their enthusiasm undimmed by the five years since her fall
from office.
About 1000 admirers were waiting patiently when she arrived at
Hatchards in Piccadilly. The line stretched up the stairs to the fifth
floor, and then restarted outside on the pavement for another 100 yards.
Inside, Lady Thatcher took her seat at a broad table, Sir Denis, as
always, at her side, and a solid wall of copies of her newly-published
book, The Path To Power, behind her.
Dozens of younger faces of Margaret Thatcher, from 1959, stared from
the pink book covers, a reminder of the passing years for the former
Prime Minister, now 69.
However, the only concession to her age was a plump cushion in the
leather chair she occupied for two hours as the Thatcherite acolytes
approached to pay homage.
Lady Thatcher took up her pen with gusto and the coveted signatures
were placed on the inside first page at bewildering speed, as befits
such a veteran of the art.
Those at Harrods still speak in awe of the lightning pace at which she
signed more than 1000 copies in two hours, smashing the all-comers
record. At one book store, Lady Thatcher was timed at seven seconds per
signature.
Most authors only manage about 700 copies, taking a little time out to
rest their aching hand and perhaps even chat to the fan buying the book.
There were few such frills for Lady Thatcher yesterday, a majesterial
''there you are, I hope you enjoy it'', sent most book buyers on their
way as their idol was stretching out a hand for the next copy.
Such fleeting contact was more than enough for the staunch
Thatcherites in the queue, the calls for her to return to power would
have turned Prime Minister John Major's hair even greyer.
First in the queue was the Rev George Betts, 71, a retired vicar from
west London, and an amateur bookbinder who was going to bind The Path To
Power lovingly in leather, to go with his signed copy of The Downing
Street Years.
''I have always had a great interest in this remarkable woman,'' he
said.
Ms Andreas Cecilia Smith, 32, from Tufnell Park, north London, who was
second in the queue to buy a signed copy for her father on Father's Day,
summed up the mood.
''I was very upset when she resigned. I think she should still be in
power.''
Politics student Matt Clare, 22, from Bethnal Green, east London, said
he just had to see her as she was such an important political figure.
''She was Prime Minister for over half my life and I think she is
wonderful.''
At the start of the book signing, there was the usual frenetic press
call and it seemed for a moment that the former Prime Minister had lost
some of her presence and grandeur, as photographers hustled for position
and called for their subject to look their way.
One forgetful photographer managed to call out, ''Over here, Mrs
Thatcher,'' which produced a fleeting look of horror on the faces of
Lady Thatcher's entourage.
Lady Thatcher was haughtily dismissive. ''I don't recognise that,''
she said with the stare that had frozen Ministers in their tracks for
years.
The mistake was quickly rectified by other photographers who then
addressed her as Baroness, before switching to Lady Thatcher.
By the end of the session, normal service had been resumed, the former
Prime Minister was addressed as ma'am, just a small step from your royal
highness, a title which many in the book shop would happily have
bestowed on her.
Meanwhile, Mr Eddie Bell, chairman of publishers HarperCollins, said
the initial print was 150,000 and they had already gone back to print
more.
