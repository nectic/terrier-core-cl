BRITAIN's second Trident-carrying submarine, HMS Victorious, failed to
put to sea and join the Royal Navy at Faslane yesterday because it was
too wet. She was stranded at the Vickers works at Barrow, where she was
built and commissioned, when constant heavy drizzle brought the
departure to a halt. The vessel, which cost #500m, failed to leave, to
the disappointment of hundreds of onlookers. The Ministry of Defence
blamed weather conditions.

SPORTING history was made yesterday when horse racing with betting
took place on a Sunday for the first time in Britain, but the event was
marred by the deaths of a veteran bookmaker and a horse taking part in
the first race. Mr Pip Sims, 83, from Winnersh, Berkshire, died from a
suspected cardiac arrest during the Tweseldown point-to-point in Church
Crookham, near Aldershot, Hampshire. Paramedics attempted to revive him
but Mr Sims, a racecourse bookmaker for 60 years, died in the ambulance.
During the day's opening race, Sword Field broke its neck and died
instantly when falling at the first obstacle. A crowd of nearly 4000
people turned up at the Tweseldown course to witness the dawn of a new
era for the sport.

BOWLERS in Inverness, who lost their only indoor rink, are hoping to
build their own. The town's venue closed four years ago, forcing bowlers
to make a 70-mile round trip to the nearest facility in Elgin. A group
of bowlers has obtained land on the outskirts of the town for a six-rink
stadium which could cost around #350,000. They hope to raise funds from
the town's 2000 bowlers, as well as grants and national lottery funding.
Spokesman Alan Wright said it is hoped eventually to build an outdoor
rink alongside, giving a year-round facility.

Sarajevo, Sunday
A DISPUTE between Bosnia's Muslim-led government and rival Serbs over
plans to open supply routes into Sarajevo could imperil the current
ceasefire in the republic, UN officials said.
Protracted wrangling over details of an agreement signed by army
commanders of both sides prevented the opening today of the so-called
''blue routes'' into the Serb-encircled Bosnian capital to humanitarian
and civilian traffic.
A UN delegation, which included the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic in the Serb stronghold of Pale on Sunday but failed to break
the deadlock.
''There is a discrepancy on how the two sides interpret the agreement
. . . and that's what we are trying to breach,'' said UN civil affairs
chief Victor Andreev.
UN officials said the Serbs brought up last-minute preconditions and
had threatened to shoot at vehicles unless their demands were met.
The Serbs denied that their forces had threatened to fire at cars. But
they object to Muslims using the routes for commercial traffic, fearing
this would allow an inflow of weapons into Sarajevo.
''If the Bosnian Serb army is not prepared to come to some sort of
arrangement, then this puts the current peace process in jeopardy. This
needs to be resolved in the short term,'' a UN spokesman, Colonel Gary
Coward, told Reuters.

TRIBUTES poured in yesterday to conductor Sir Alexander Gibson, whose
death from a heart attack on Saturday afternoon left Scotland's musical
community stunned.
Sir Alex, 68, had been making recordings last week with the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra in London. He had felt unwell on Friday and was
taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington where he died.
Mr Morrison Dunbar, chairman of the Royal SNO, of which Sir Alex had
been principal conductor for 25 years from 1959, announced his death at
a concert in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on Saturday night.
Mr Dunbar said: ''We've lost a great Scot and a truly great man.
Nobody this century has done more for Scottish music.''

Grozny, Sunday
REBEL fighters battled Russian forces room to room in buildings near
the presidential palace in Grozny today but held onto the towering
palace, the symbol of resistance in the Chechen capital.
Russian news agencies said in unconfirmed reports that Ovlur Dudayev,
son of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, had died of wounds
received in battle.
They gave few details but said he had already been buried.
A first planeload of urgent supplies from the United Nations landed in
Vladikavkaz, just outside Chechnya, to help refugees of the
five-week-old conflict.
Fighters resisting the Russian drive to crush their small southern
region's campaign for independence held on to the presidential palace
despite more of the shelling which has badly damaged the concrete
building, their main headquarters.
The rebels still held the palace in the early evening after a day of
relatively light fighting, despite the battles in nearby buildings,
witnesses said.
Exhausted from a night of combat and covered with dust, Akhmed Kadivo,
30, led a band of fighters back from the palace along central
Avturkhanov Street in the afternoon.
''There was fighting all night in some of the buildings on the square.
Room by room we fought the Russians. We captured about 30 prisoners,''
he said.
Russian military sources in Nazran, capital of the neighbouring
Ingushetia region, said Moscow's forces were tightening a circle around
the palace.
But the reporters in Grozny saw no sign of major changes in Russian or
Chechen positions, although the Russians had clearly sought to advance
on the palace over the weekend.
More protests against President Boris Yeltsin's decision to send troop
and tanks into Chechnya on December 11 were held in Moscow and St
Petersburg.
About 1000 people gathered in the centre of Moscow to hear demands by
liberal politicials for the troops to be withdrawn.
Several hundred attended a rally in St Petersburg.
Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters and civilians have
been killed in the fighting.
Five more were killed when a mortar bomb or artillery shell slammed
into a five-storey building in Grozny's South Square area.
Russian officers at Mozdok air base in southern Russia, the
operation's command point, acknowledged that they were meeting tough
resistance from Chechen fighters.
''It seems that those who remain in the presidential palace are
determined to die there,'' an officer who declined to be identified told
Reuter correspondent Anatoly Verbin.
In Nazran, the head of Chechnya's revered Council of Elders said Ovlur
Dudayev had been killed and buried, news agencies reported.
''Dzhokhar Dudayev's son has died of wounds received in the defence of
Grozny and was buried the day before yesterday (Friday),'' Said-Akhmed
Adizov was quoted as saying
The reports could not be confirmed in Grozny as telephone contact has
been severed. None of the agencies gave Ovlur's age or said where he was
buried.
The conflict in Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region of about one million
people, has driven more than 130,000 people from their homes, according
to official Russian figures.
The Geneva headquarters of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said a Russian IL-76 cargo plane carrying 42 tonnes of relief
supplies landed in Vladikavkaz, in Russia's North Ossetia region.
The cargo included 14,250 blankets, four tonnes of soap, 11.5 tonnes
of plastic sheeting, World Health Organisation medical supplies, a
vehicle and communications equipment.
The plane was due back on Tuesday with 33 more tonnes of supplies.
But a UNHCR spokesman said Russian officials were restricting the
movements of a 10-member UNHCR mission which had been in Vladikavkaz
since last Wednesday to assess the needs of refugees.
The mission had been able to make only a single one-day trip to
Ingushetia, a region with more than 80,000 Chechen refugees, spokesman
Ron Redmond said.
He added: ''We still need better access and freedom of movement in
Ingushetia.''--Reuter.

THE new Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail building at Cardonald
Park, Glasgow, is an impressive new addition to the skyline beside the
M8 motorway. The 77-week #20m hi-tech project was finished on schedule
last month. It is also one of the largest steel structures erected in
the West of Scotland in recent years.
The printing complex has been built on a 12-acre site on the former
and well-known ''fifty pitches'' location. The project, initiated in
March 1993, has been printing newspapers since October last.
''It was both a complex and important contract,'' said Mr Alex Miller,
contracts manager for the builders, Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd.
''Throughout, it meant working to fine tolerances. As an example floors
had to be laid to within millimetres of accuracy because of the complex
machinery to be accommodated.''
Alex Miller describes one of the major factors of the successful
completion of the project as ''the way in which the client was part of
the team. Builder, design team and client worked together. We sat
regularly around the same table, something which does not always happen.
As a result, we always knew what was wanted and the client was always
aware of what he was going to get and when he was going to get it''.
The total structure occupies more than 16,000 square metres, the heart
being a press hall 75 metres long and 19 metres high. The complex's 2400
tonne main structural steel frame has curved eaves with north and south
walls clad in horizontally profiled plastisol coated steel.
''In basic terms, we are talking of a steel-framed building on a
concrete foundation,'' said Alex Miller. ''It occupies various levels
and is best described as being in four main areas. One is the front
office and service area with stores. A second is the fully automated
paper reel store where the reels are stocked in high racks. Then there
is the press room with its four colour presses and finally the
publishing and inserting area.''
The design team for the project comprised architect Wylie Shanks,
quantity surveyor Barker Barton and Lawson, structural engineer McLay
Collier &amp; Partners and services engineer Donald Smith Seymor &amp; Rooley.
The project was built on a greenfield site and had the obvious
benefits of a location close to the M8. Extensive piling work was
carried out by Stent Hercules, part of the Balfour Beatty group.
The final required specification included high standards of security
with security cameras, beams and spot detectors and a computerised fire
prevention system.
In addition to the necessary van parking areas there is space for 150
cars.
Construction of this large, prestigious and fast track contract meant
considerable evening work without any formal night shift operation.
''From a building viewpoint, the most unusual feature was without
doubt the requirements in the press hall,'' said Alex Miller. ''The
floors had to be uniformly level for the operation involved and for the
prevention of machine vibration. Thirty-six piles were required under
each pair of presses. Then a large concrete 'coffin' was made for each
pair. The coffins were three metres deep, these were then filled by
single pourings to result in single monolithic blocks each of 500 cubic
metres of concrete.
''These were large concrete pours, but the result is that each pair of
presses sit isolated from the rest of the structure.''
Other aspects of the complex include the front office area which is
finished to a high specification.
A two-storey double glazed mirror glass frontage provides the canteen
and offices with a northerly view and recessed screen areas give covered
entrance routes for staff and visitors. The result both screens staff
working inside and provides an attractive external effect.
At peak, 400 of a workforce were involved in construction. Early
priorities included making the building water and dust free, and making
provision for the many services that would be required.
''A newspaper printing plant is a complex building,'' said Alex Miller
with a dry understatement.
Provision had to be made for the installation of much electronic
equipment then for the required heating, lighting and ventilation and
the feeding of services to the presses. In some areas certain humidity
levels had to be maintained.
''A large number of air handling units operate within the building,
along with energy control and building management systems.
''Paper reels are conveyed around the building on automatically guided
vehicles. These AGVs are remote controlled by electronic sensors located
within the concrete floors. When an AGV approaches a door, that door
automatically opens then shuts again once the vehicle is through. That
was one of the many areas where we found ourselves working to very fine
tolerances.''
Marketing manager Jack Quick agreed that the contract ''both complex
and important was a positive reflection on today's building industry's
ability.
''This is a good illustration of how a job should be done, with each
phase of the work involved backed by an excellent team spirit and with
the client as part of that team,'' he said. ''The basic secret is the
way in which everyone worked together in such a positive manner.
Reinforcing the Balfour Beatty involvement in the project, an associated
company within the group, Raynesway Construction carried out the #2.4m
contract from Strathclyde Regional Council to provide the new main
access road to the printing headquarters and to other development areas
within the overall site.''
The new landmark, striking by day and easily recognisable from the air
is even more impressive when lit for its nightly operations. A small
group of the contractor's workforce is still on site, carrying out what
Balfour Beatty described as ''mainly tidying up''. But they expect even
that last trace of the construction involved to be gone before the end
of March.

A CLAIM by trade unions at the BP oil refinery at Grangemouth that a
management move to withdraw bargaining rights from 700 workers would
jeopardise public safety was last night rejected by the company.
The unions had warned yesterday that any reduction in union influence
would lead to a slackening of vital health and safety procedures.
They said the refinery had been at the centre of several public safety
scares in recent years.
The Grangemouth district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers Union, Mr John Elliott, said the safety of the public and those
who worked at the refinery was at the top of the unions' agenda.
''All health and safety representatives are elected and confirmed by
the trade unions in accordance with the law,'' he said.
He said the unions were losing their right to appoint safety reps.
Workers were incensed and a joint union campaign was being launched.
However, a company spokesman said the suggestion that the unions were
going to lose this right was simply not true.
''They will continue to elect reps for safety committees. Safety is of
paramount importance to everyone at the refinery and we recognise our
role in the community.''
Any withdrawal of bargaining rights had the backing of the workforce
because of the company's wish, in planning for future success, to
develop a single-team operation.
''It would be inconsistent to have collective bargaining for part of
the team -- and anyway this issue has no influence on the safety side of
it.''
* Scotland's water workers have settled their annual pay claim,
gaining an average pay rise of 2.5%. A ballot of the 3000 manual workers
approved the deal, backdated to July, by a two-to-one majority.
Mr Robert Parker, chief union negotiator for the Scottish water supply
industry and head of GMB Scotland's public services section, said
negotiations had been ''bedevilled by the coming upheaval of Scottish
local government reorganisation''.

Bruce Sandison on an island retreat
YOU don't have to part with an arm and a leg to find peace, seclusion
and unadulterated holiday sun. Simply find the Balearic island of
Formentera, unspoiled, rural, welcoming, and fringed by some of the most
magnificent golden-sand beaches in the Mediterranean.
Temperatures range from 67F in April to 82F in July and 75F in
October. The sea is always warm, even in spring, and there are rarely
less than eight hours of sunshine each day. Just about right for the
bucket-and-spade brigade, tired mums and dads, adventure-seeking
teenagers, sluggard and athlete alike.
Where's the catch? Well, getting there generally requires an overnight
stop in Ibiza, prior to catching a morning ferry for the seven-mile
journey south to La Sabina in Formentera. But this tends to keep the
madding crowds at bay and as a result Formentera is never really busy,
even at the height of the season.
Formentera is the smallest of the Balearic Islands, 37 square miles, a
silver sickle set amid incredibly blue seas. The highest point on the
island is La Mola (192m), approached by a winding Roman road peaked by a
lighthouse described by the writer, Jules Verne, as being ''the
lighthouse at the end of the world''.
Although catering for visitors is the principal industry on
Formentera, the traditional way of life, simple farming and animal
husbandry, still continues. Produce is sold in markets and shops in Es
Pujols, the main visitor centre, and in San Francisco Javier, the island
capital; cheese, milk, honey, figs, nuts, eggs, butter, wine, and
amazing local bread.
Formentera has long been the haunt of artists, many of whom spend
winter on the island, and their work is exhibited extensively in local
galleries and markets: paintings, pottery, sculpture, wood carvings,
ceramics, metalwork, jewellery, and outstanding leatherwork.
The island is also famous for hand-made guitars and has a residential
school which offers instruction in that discipline; combined with
practical use of instruments in company with the ''Formentera
Woodwarriors Band'', playing rock and blues at various venues, arranged
and impromptu, all over the island.
The most popular beaches are at the north of the island on either side
of a narrow, yellow-sand peninsula centred by soft dunes. Illetas, to
the west, is calm and shallow, perfect for lazing and swimming; Levante,
to the east, is a more vigorous affair, washed by surging, green and
blue white-crested breakers where a car is required. Both are served by
beach restaurants.
The beach at Es Pujols is very much a family affair, close to town and
with multitudinous water sport facilities. Further east, towards La
Mola, by the beautiful little fishing village of Es Calo, is Tramontana
Beach, at the foot of dark, rocky cliffs, ideal for serious snorkel and
scuba work.
The largest Formentera beach, and least frequented, is Playa Mitjorn
to the south; four miles of white sand, interspersed by a series of
coves and secluded bays. This is my favourite beach, backed by
sweet-smelling, butterfly bright pinewoods and red, well-worked fields,
busy with brilliantly plumed hoopoe.

DETECTIVES in Kilmarnock are investigating an attack on a woman jogger
in Riccarton Road near the Bellfield interchange on Saturday evening.
The 26-year-old woman, who asked police not to reveal her identity,
was approached by a man at about 7pm who grabbed her by the arm and
pointed what appeared to be a firearm at her.
Police said the man then told her to climb over a fence into a field
but the woman escaped, only to be caught by the man who tried a second
time to pull her over the fence.
She again managed to break free and ran towards Bellfield roundabout
where she stopped a passing police car. Although shaken by her ordeal,
the woman was unharmed and no shots were fired.
The man, who made off towards Hurlford, is described as being about
25-years-old, 6ft tall, with dark straight collar-length hair and was
said to be wearing a dark-coloured jacket and trousers.
Detectives are anxious to speak to anyone who was in the area at the
time and who may have seen anything suspicious. Their inquiries have
established that the man may have been seen in Hurlford shortly after
the incident.

A CLIMBER wearing jeans, desert boots, and light clothing was escorted
down Ben Nevis suffering from mild hypothermia in freezing conditions at
the weekend.
The incident, which the leader of one of Scotland's top mountain
rescue teams said could have ended in tragedy, follows repeated warnings
that climbers should not take to the mountains unless they are
experienced and fully equipped for the conditions.
The man, believed to be an English holidaymaker, was found by chance
by an off-duty RAF mountain rescue team member as he sheltered in a hut
at the 4406ft snow-covered summit of the mountain on Saturday.
Mr David Buchanan, a member of the RAF St Athan mountain rescue team
from South Wales, had been climbing with friends when he discovered the
man and offered to take him back down the mountain.
The man is thought to have been suffering from mild hypothermia. He
had apparently been preparing to spend the night in the mountain
shelter.
It is thought that he had set out from Ballachulish on Saturday and
walked 12 miles from his holiday accommodation to Fort William before
deciding to climb Ben Nevis.
A police spokesman said the the climber, believed to be a 27-year-old
artist from Canterbury in Kent, was officially not rescued from the
mountain and that they had no information on the incident.
But yesterday, Mr Miller Harris, secretary of Lochaber Mountain Rescue
Team, urged climbers to heed warnings, and said the man could have died
on the mountain.
''Our view is that everyone climbing the mountains should be
experienced and properly equipped. Although they are not very high, the
Scottish mountains can have very severe conditions which can catch out
even the most experienced climber.
''It is important that people have equipment such as an ice axe,
crampons, a map, a compass, and proper clothing. If this man was dressed
in jeans and desert boots, he was better equipped for Fort William High
Street than any hill or mountain.
''He is an extremely lucky man. If the RAF mountain rescue man hadn't
been there, he could have been in extreme difficulty, particularly if he
hadn't informed anyone of where he was going.''
Mr Harris added that a problem often encountered by the Lochaber
mountain rescue team was a public misconception that Ben Nevis was
relatively easy to climb. He said the team was seeking to ensure that
literature on which a track to the summit is referred to as a tourist
track is changed to refer to a mountain track.
''In the two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours is takes people to
climb Ben Nevis, the weather can change from good to raging blizzards
and catch out even very experienced climbers,'' said Mr Harris.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service warned yesterday that the
avalanche hazard in Lochaber will become ''considerable'' today with the
arrival of fresh snow, forming areas of unstable windslab on easterly
aspects.
Meanwhile, a man was recovering yesterday after being plucked by
helicopter from a cliff face when he became stuck while climbing near
North Berwick in East Lothian.
Mr John Dickie, 26, of Eglinton Crescent, Coates, Edinburgh, had been
out walking on the foreshore with two friends on Saturday when he tried
to climb a 70ft cliff at Gin Head and got into difficulties near the
top.
He was lifted to safety by a helicopter from RAF Boulmer in
Northumberland.

SAN FRANCISCO: Californians yesterday got a break from the storms that
have caused severe flooding across the state, allowing swollen rivers to
recede and flood victims to get on with cleaning their mud-caked homes.
Last week's powerful storms took 11 lives, and forced thousands of

Washington, Sunday
DEMOCRATS in Congress are on the warpath against Newt Gingrich and
Rupert Murdoch, or are at least doing a little war-dance as a
preliminary to the real thing.
They contend that the new Speaker of the House was up to no good when
he met the publisher last November.
Gingrich led his Republicans to victory in the elections on November
8, and became the brightest star in Washington the next day.
Just before Christmas, HarperCollins announced that it had offered him
$4.5m to write two books on his political philosophy.
HarperCollins, which in its uncompounded days consisted of a leading
American publisher and the leading Scottish publisher, now belongs to
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
News Corp also owns the Fox television network here, which has some
serious problems with the federal government.
Gingrich issued a statement that he had not known that Murdoch owned
HarperCollins when he signed the book contract, and Mr Murdoch, from
Peking, where he was buying up Chinese television, stated that he had
known nothing of the book deal.
All the same, Gingrich renounced the advance. Then it emerged that
Murdoch had called on Gingrich on November 28, a few days before
HarperCollins started serious negotiations for the book.
Both men said they had not discussed publishing or anything else: it
was just a courtesy call by one potentate on another.
Then it transpired that the asking price for the book went from $2m to
$4m early in December, when Gingrich got himself a new agent who had
worked closely with HarperCollins and, we have since discovered, did not
negotiate seriously with anyone else.
The Democrats started demanding outside counsel to investigate the
Speaker's ethics. Murdoch's problem, that Gingrich may help resolve, is
that the law states that foreigners and foreign entities cannot own more
than 25% of American television companies.
Murdoch made himself an American citizen to get around this
protectionist legalism when he bought his first TV stations and started
Fox, in 1986.
But now one of his rivals, NBC Television, has sued to make him sell
Fox because actual ownership is vested in the News Corporation of
Adelaide, South Australia, the ultimate Murdoch holding company.
All this has nothing to do with publishing, said he, Gingrich
concurring.
But yesterday, the New York Daily News, which is in permanent
competition with Murdoch's New York Post, revealed that Murdoch had
taken his chief lobbyist along with him to the meeting with Gingrich,
and they had, indeed, discussed their problems with the NBC suit and the
Federal Communications Commission.
This may all be perfectly innocent, but at the least the tardy
revelations of meetings and discussions smacks of disingenuousness.
That, at any rate, is how the Democrats see it. They note that two
Republican congressmen have introduced bills to change the law in
Murdoch's favour, and would need Gingrich's approval to get it through
the House.
They probably do not remember that there was a rather similar incident
in 1980, when Murdoch had lunch with President Jimmy Carter a few weeks
before a crucial Democratic primary in New York.
It was a pure coincidence, of course, that the same day a federal
agency was considering an application by Murdoch for a favourable loan
to buy planes for an airline he owned.
The Post came out for the president shortly afterwards and the loan
was approved.
Carter is a sainted figure these days, but cynics have long suspected,
despite all the denials, that there was a quid for the quo, or a wink
for a nudge.
This time, no doubt, Murdoch knew nothing of the book but perhaps his
lobbyist did, and there may even have been some communication between
the Fox lobbyist and HarperCollins.

HUNDREDS of British troops could be suffering in silence from Gulf War
Syndrome four years after fighting erupted, it was claimed yesterday.
Solicitors said more than 500 veterans had come forward to launch
claims against the Ministry of Defence.
Ms Hilary Meredith, a partner at law firm Donn &amp; Co, which is
representing more than 450 alleged victims, said there could be an even
greater number of veterans still serving in the forces who were
reluctant to come forward.
''The Ministry of Defence still denies there is any problem,'' she
said. ''Yet, despite this, a number of Gulf war veterans have been
granted war disability pensions attributable to their service in the
Gulf. ''Legal aid has now been granted on a number of cases and it is
hoped that within a few weeks investigations can start in an attempt to
prove a cause for our clients' suffering.''
She said the company was confident that writs would be issued against
the MoD towards the end of the year.
However, the MoD insisted there was ''not a shred of evidence'' to
suggest Gulf War Syndrome existed. ''The complaints do not have a
syndromic pattern,'' said a spokesman. ''All of those we have had the
opportunity to examine have been shown to suffer from a variety of known
medical complaints unconnected with their Gulf war service.''
Nevertheless, Mr Nicholas Soames, Armed Forces Minister, has appealed
to those worried about their health to come forward for examinations.

Brussels
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke and other EU economic and finance ministers
are likely to review the latest turbulence in currency markets when they
gather in Brussels today.
After a week of upheavals in the European exchange rate mechanism,
following a period of calm, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo
have been damaged by a flight to stronger currencies, notably the
D-mark.
The peseta fell last week two-thirds of the way to its ERM floor
despite a decision in the summer of 1993 to widen fluctuation bands in
the grid to 15% either side of parity. But ministers have taken comfort
in the fact that the causes this time are political and not purely
economic or the work of speculators.
A diplomatic source blamed Spain's continuing government crisis for
the peseta's problems. The problems of the escudo are largely caused by
its links to the peseta.
Austria last week formally entered its strong schilling to the grid.
''The crisis is not on the agenda,'' said a diplomat, adding: ''But it
would be surprising if it was not discussed at least informally.''
Ministers will concentrate on how to create more growth in Europe and
continue the fight against unemployment. They will debate the ambitious
plan by Mr Jacques Delors, retiring president of the European
Commission, to promote jobs while increasing EU industrial
competitiveness.
The meeting will be the first to be conducted by the incoming French
presidency. Ministers will later assemble in their role as directors of
the European Investment Bank, which is planning support for so-called
Trans-European Networks including a #700m plan to electrify the west
coast Glasgow-London rail line.

A YOUNG man with business acumen is rueing a missed opportunity. The
Herald has revealed to him that a board game similar to one he invented
as a schoolboy has become a money spinner.
Walkin' The Mat has proved a huge hit with Aberdonians in the month
since it went on sale, and almost all of the 5000 first edition games
have been sold out at #24.95.
The game is produced by Aberdeen businessmen Jim Stephen, of Osprey
Promotions Ltd, and he is already working on a second set of questions
for the game, which bears similarities to Trivial Pursuit. He has also
been approached about the possibility of producing an Edinburgh or
Glasgow edition of the game he patented last January.
But Mr Bob Drummond and some schoolmates produced a very similar best
seller in 1987 when a pupil at Harlaw Academy. It earned them #10 each.
His mother in Aberdeen, who was aware of the tremendous success of
Walkin' The Mat, had decided not to tell him because she felt he might
be a little annoyed. ''He was very proud of his game,'' she said.
Mr Drummond, who works with Scotsman Publications in Edinburgh and
will shortly qualify as an accountant, was one of a group of pupils who
joined forces in 1987 to compete in a Young Enterprise Trust
start-your-own-business scheme.
It was he who came up with the idea of a board game of particular
interest to Aberdonians. The result was Granite City Experience, a cross
between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit, with players making their way
round a board marked with Aberdeen landmarks by answering questions on
the Granite City.
Walkin' The Mat also involves players making their way round a board
marked in similar fashion by answering questions on the city, and
finishes with a journey up Union Street.
An initial Granite City Experience run of 100 was sold out at #9.99
with most copies going to pupils. A second edition was produced and a
further 80 were sold, mostly at a fair in the city's St Nicholas Centre.
The school company, Yours Personally, was established with a #50 loan
from the NatWest and more than #150 was raised by issuing shares to
fellow pupils at 25p a share.
As is the case with all Young Enterprise companies, it was wound up at
the end of the project.
''We never took it any further although I did think it could be quite
successful. It got a lot of publicity on television, radio, and in local
papers at the time,'' he said. ''It is very interesting to hear about
the success of the new game. It's quite a shock really.
''We sold ours at #9.99 and made quite a big profit margin. It was my
idea, but it was a group effort to produce it. I think we all received a
#10 bonus at the end, but the rest of the money went back into the Young
Enterprise account to benefit the school.''
Mr Drummond clearly has entrepreneurial flair because while at
university he was part of a team which won a Bank of Scotland award for
the best small business.
Last night, Mr Stephen, the inventor of Walkin' The Mat, said: ''I
would love to see one of the games the school pupils produced. I have
only heard about it in the past week, and it was not clear which school
was involved. I am desperate to see what it looks like.''
Walkin' The Mat takes its title from the city's boy-wants-to-meet-girl
tradition of walking up and down Union Street.
Mr Drummond still has a treasured edition of Granite City Experience
in his bedroom at his parents' home, and doesn't plan to buy Walkin' The
Mat.
''At #24.95, I couldn't afford it,'' he said.

From WILLIAM RUSSELL
in Shoreham
SATURDAY lunchtime. It is a dreich day, grey clouds scud across the
sky, and the threat of rain is ever present. Shoreham harbour is no
place to be in January, but the animal rights pickets have been here for
days, confined behind barriers along the main road, but free on the
other side of the slip road leading to the harbour to wander down
towards the entrance.
The main road is a dual carriageway and from two of the lampposts on
the central barrier hang effigies of Philip Lacey, general manager of
Shoreham Port. The first placard reads -- Wanted, dead or alive. The
second effigy, dressed in an old grey business suit, says -- Export
Lacey, not the animals.
There are banners, some carried on poles by the pickets, others
attached to the garden hedges of the trim little houses on the far side
of the road. Hannibal Lacey, Silencer of the Lambs. End this bloody
trade now. Shoreham's Shame, Have a good day. None of these animals
will. Waldegrave, Opt Out Now. If you care about sheep, give a beep.
The last evokes a response from the passing cars. The horns hoot in
sympathy. The weather may be dreary, although as Saturday goes on the
sun comes out briefly and the temperature rises slightly, but the
pickets are cheerful. They believe they are winning the argument.
High tide is going to be around six in the evening and they say if
there is a shipment of calves coming it will be some time before then. I
go back about half-past-five. Darkness has fallen. The half dozen
amiable policemen from the local force have been increased in number.
There are now some dozen or so on parade, more sitting in two vans
parked discreetly down the slip road.
An inspector tells a boy who is banging a drum to stop his racket --
the drummer has insulated himself from the noise by wearing ear muffs
like those worn by men parking aeroplanes. The boy moves off, disappears
in the crowd, but starts up again and some girls dance to the rhythm.
There are about 70 people present, 40 more than at lunchtime. It is
all very friendly. There is no spokesman, no organiser. This is a
spontaneous protest, although in many of the windows of the trim little
houses in the streets behind the seafront are pasted a polite little
notice from the local branch of the RSPCA urging people to check the
high tide times in the Argus, the local paper, and come an hour or so
beforehand to join the protest.
These people are not the usual rent-a-mob lot, let alone vegetarian
fanatics fuelled on nut cutlets, high on a diet of spinach quiche and
brown rice. This is Middle England, ordinary people outraged by the
cruelty of the veal trade, people who never go on protest marches, but
who do watch television and have been appalled.
Sandra Harwood, a secretary to a loss adjuster in Hove, summed things
up. ''I thought it was going to be New Age travellers and wierdos,'' she
said. ''But it isn't. It is just people.'' She has been turning out
regularly since the protests started two weeks ago, and was full of
praise for the Sussex police. Their behaviour had been marvellous, she
said.
Caroline Evans, from Reigate, who has been campaigning to stop the
export of live animals since 1973, had turned up with her children. She
was down last Saturday too. It was the least they could do.
Mrs Julie Ray, who lives across the road, a douce middle-aged woman,
the last person one would expect to find on a picket line, said Philip
Lacey's claim that he could not legally refuse to handle the veal calf
and sheep shipments was not true. The act of 1847 said he could handle
them ''providing the facilities were right''. He could rule that
Shoreham's facilities were not right.
As for the trouble there has been at Shoreham, the protesters blame
the extra police drafted in from outside -- from London's Metropolitan
Police -- and some local post-closing time unruly elements who turned up
to see what they could see.
The Met's behavour was bitterly resented by everyone I spoke to, as
was their boasting about the #200 a day they were earning in overtime.
Maybe their move-along-there-and-don't-argue tactics are right for
Trafalgar Square, but Shoreham folk are not used to being refused access
to their homes or having truncheons poked in their ribs by men encased
in body armour.
''I said I wanted to go to my house over there,'' Julie Ray said,
pointing across the dual carriageway. ''I had moved to the end of the
police line -- I was not trying to get through -- but he did not listen.
He had his baton. I got a few prods. It was frightening.''
The Sussex police, by contrast, have handled the affair with kid
gloves. The chief constable, Paul Whitehouse, has tried to persuade Mr
Lacey to stop the shipments, as well he might. The force has spent some
#2m so far on the operation, the contingency fund is exhausted, and the
Home Office is proving less than sympathetic about providing any extra
cash.
A circular from Hove and Shoreham divisional commander, David Ashby,
has been sent round local businesses and organisations expressing thanks
to local residents and businesses for their co-operation. ''I must
stress that the police action should not be taken as supporting one side
or the other in the current debate in the export of live animals,'' it
reads. ''Every police officer has his or her own view -- but all have an
overriding duty to uphold the law.'' It was appreciated.
The Sussex constables on duty, men and women, have left little doubt
as to whose side they would be on if they could take sides, and some
have turned up when off duty to show solidarity, I was told. A car stops
and a man hurls abuse at the pickets. The policeman tells him to drive
on, a woman tries to attach a sticker to his window. ''Did you manage to
get it on?'' the officer asks.
Bob Wylie from Eastbourne said he had seen one of the incidents at
Shoreham on television. A boy had smashed the window of one of the
lorries. ''I saw it on television and I admired that lad for standing up
for what he believed right,'' he said. ''I thought, if he can do that,
the least I can do is come and stand here.''
His friend, Patricia Thomas, a nurse, said she came every day, fitting
in her work with stints on the picket line. ''This trade cannot be
allowed to go on,'' she said.
Yesterday the weather had improved, and by mid-morning the picket was
down to about 19 people, the police presence to around five. There had
been no attempted shipments overnight. The mood was defiant and hopeful.
We are winning, read the banners.
As for the reports of booby trapped letters containing razor blades
and death threats sent to William Waldegrave by animal rights
terrorists, it was nothing to do with them. They are not terrorists,
activists, anarchists, or loonies. The Government would do well to heed
the people of Shoreham because as Edmund Burke said: ''In all forms of
government the people is the true legislator.''

ANALYSTS will be hoping for harder news this week on Ladbroke's
rumoured sale of its Texas Homecare chain.
There were strong rumours last week that Ladbroke was talking to J.
Sainsbury about the possible sale. A decision by Ladbroke to sell Texas
to concentrate on its mainstream betting shops and hotels activities
would come as little surprise, given its performance lately. Sainsbury
is also eager to expand its Homebase DIY chain.
However, agreeing a price could prove difficult because, in addition
to the purchase price Sainsbury would have to rationalise the 238-strong
network through closing smaller outlets and on re-equipping the rest.
But Texas does include valuable out of town sites which are hard to find
as planning restrictions bite.
The business is valued in the 1993 Ladbroke accounts at #343m, but
Sainsbury would not want to pay as much as this so that Ladbroke would
face a write-off in its accounts to cover the difference between the
figures.
Homebase is performing well in a competitive market which is not
likely to get any easier, particularly as an American cut-price DIY
retailer, Home Depot, is poised to enter the UK.
Homebase's 82 outlets gives it just over 3% of the market, a long way
behind leader B&amp;Q, which has 15%. The purchase of Texas would put it
only a few percentage points behind B&amp;Q, with economies of scale
benefiting margins.

The company is a leading manufacturer of speciality plastic foams.
Since 1992, Zotefoams has prospered, more than doubling operating profit
to #5.4m last year compared with 1991 on sales of #17.4m.
Zotefoams plans to raise manufacturing capacity by 50% by 1996.
Managing director Bill Fairservice commented: ''Both the range of
applications and geographical markets for Zotefoams' speciality foams

CAMELINA sativa, a brassica oil-crop which was grown commercially in
Europe until the 1950's, has been ''re-discovered,'' and could be about
to make a comeback as a raw material for bio-fuel.
The crop originally fell out of favour when its oil proved inferior to
rape oil for the manufacture of margarine. Now it is being hailed as
nutritionally superior to oilseed rape, and it is also said to have
greater prospects as a bio-fuel.
Scientists in Denmark, Ireland, Germany, and Canada, are currently
researching both spring and winter varieties, and investigating possible
outlets for the crop -- which can be cultivated using conventional
machinery.
''Camelina needs no pesticides, and little fertiliser,'' says Dr Josef
Zubr at the Royal Agricultural and Veterinary University in Copenhagen.
''That makes the crop potentially more profitable than spring oilseed
rape.''
Although normally sown as a spring crop, Camelina can germinate and
grow at temperatures as low as minus one centigrade. The crop is also
frost-tolerant, allowing autumn establishment in order to mop-up
leachable nitratres over the winter.
Scientists at the Oakpark Research Station in Ireland recommend a
March seed rate of 6kg per hectare. All but very heavy soils are
suitable. There are no herbicides cleared for use in Camelina, but
trifluralin has been used to control weeds prior to sowing.
''Steerage hoeing can be used to control weeds in the crops, as
Camelina plants recover easily from the mechanical bruising,'' says Dr
Zubr. ''Some of the broader leafed varieties are able to smother
competitor weeds.''
Comparing growing costs for Camelina and spring oilseed rape under
Irish conditions, Dr James Burke and colleagues at Oakpark found that
total costs for producing Camelina were #250 per hectare, nearly half
those for spring rape. Yields for the two crops were similar -- at about
2.5 tonnes per hectare.
According to Dr Zubr, 1993 spring crops averaged 2.5 tonnes in
Denmark, and as much as four tonnes in central Europe. Should a wider
breeding programme be developed for Camelina, these yields could be
surpassed, he believes.
Nutritionists praise Camelina oil, saying it can help prevent some of
the diseases associated with modern living. Human volunteers, with high
levels of cholesterol in their blood serum, who underwent an eight-week
trial with Camelina in their diet, showed cholesterol levels reduced by
about 8%.
Mature Camelina plants carry tiny pear-shaped pods, which have been
shown to retain their seeds for more than four weeks after chemical
dessication. This characteristic makes Camelina less susceptible to the
harvest losses which make rape yields unpredictable.
Camelina's greatest prospects may, however, be as a biological fuel.
''Low growing costs, and the ease with which oil can be pressed from the
seed, give Camelina a cost advantage of between 5p and 15p per litre
relative to rape methylester,'' says Dr Burke.
Other scientists are currently developing new patentable methods of
processing Camelina for fuel, which could further enhance the potential
of the crop for biofuel.
Oilcake, a by-product of Camelina oil production, has been shown to
contain high levels of amino acids -- including arginine, cysteine,
glycine, methionine, and threonine, indicating a feed value similar to
soya cake in mixtures for laying hens.
Camelina is not at present eligible to be grown on the 750,000 acres
of set-aside land available for fuel crops under the Gatt agreement.
However, Dr Burke is optimistic that when the cost and environmental
advantages of Camelina are outlined to the Commission, the crop will be
accepted for use on set-aside land.

SOUTH Africa's white Communist Party leader Joe Slovo, who spent a
lifetime fighting apartheid, was buried today in the Soweto township
where he was a hero to millions of blacks.
Lithuanian-born Slovo, who died of cancer on January 6, aged 68, lived
to see his dream of democracy come true when South Africa held its first
all-race elections last April.
He was buried in a simple pine coffin with rope handles at Heroes'
Acre in Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg.
As the country observed a day of mourning, President Nelson Mandela
led a packed multi-faith memorial service at Soweto's Orlando stadium.
Many of the young blacks shot by police and soldiers during Soweto's
anti-apartheid uprising in 1976 are among the 150,000 people interred in
the stark, treeless township cemetery.
Slovo is only the second white buried in Heroes' Acre. Helen Joseph, a
leading white anti-apartheid campaigner, was laid to rest there last
year.
Thousands of people from the township streamed to the graveside
At the service before the burial, President Mandela said: ''Today, as
the nation bids you final farewell, we are at the same time celebrating
a life lived to the full; the richness of which touched the hearts of
millions and made an indelible mark on the history of our
country.''--Reuter.

IN his new role as an aspiring Eurocrat, Mr Neil Kinnock tried a joke
last week during his congressional-style interrogation in the European
Parliament. He soon wished he hadn't bothered.
Mr Kinnock remarked light-heartedly that, in his proposed new career
as European Commissioner for Transport, he was willing to work terribly
hard at building better transport links and that if things got difficult
his faith could yet move mountains.
It took the usual few seconds for the simultaneous translation to work
its way through to everyone's earphones.
Just as Mr Kinnock sat back, happy in the knowledge his charm
offensive seemed to be going down well, an environmentally-preoccupied
Green Euro-MP grabbed the stage and furiously demanded to know why Mr
Kinnock wanted to move mountains. Talk about losing it in the
translation.
This week the process of allowing European to shout at European will
become even more complicated with the arrival of the Austrians, Finns,
and Swedes. This means that the number of official EU languages rises
from nine to 11 (Austrians, of course, speak German).
Of the 13,000 souls employed by the European Commission -- only
slightly more than the Scottish Office despite all the talk of a
top-heavy Brussels bureaucracy -- about one-third of them work in oral
interpretation and written translation. Until the end of last year, when
the old Council of Ministers met with 12 member states, there had to be
33 interpreters on hand to allow politicians to talk to each other.
Someone has since worked out that with the Finns and Swedes in
attendance the number of language combinations rises to 110. Some of
them are exotic: how about a job translating Finnish to Greek, or
Portuguese to Swedish.
The EU is, therefore, recruiting more interpreters and translators. I
don't know how many but I bet they could fill an aircraft.
Language is also politically explosive in Europe. Last week, the
Belgian Government almost collapsed (again) over a linguistic dispute.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, the great political fixer, had to use
all of his famous powers of persuasion to keep together his coalition,
after another dispute between the French-speaking Walloons and
Dutch-speaking Flemish.
In the east of Belgium, there is a group of villages, near the Dutch
Border, where most of the 4000 souls speak a German dialect, but
two-thirds of them describe themselves as French speakers. They live in
a Dutch-speaking province, having been transferred for administrative
purposes from a French-speaking area, a switch which has left them with
a grievance.
A Francophone mayor, who refuses to speak Flemish, was elected a few
years ago, then unseated. Last week, he threatened to reclaim the title
after making a political comeback. All hell broke out. Francophone
newspapers supported him. Flemish commentators condemned him.
Ministers were dragged into the dispute and Mr Dehaene had to knock
heads together, broker deals, cough up with political, and cultural
sweeteners in return for another, less controversial candidate, before
he could be sure his government would survive which it did, just.
Also last week, the French were back in their old routine of
championing European protectionism in the audio-visual sector, mainly
television, which they see as a force for the destruction of European,
mainly French, culture. They are, of course, correct in their diagnosis
if not necessarily their cure.
Hollywood culture dominates the world, never mind France, and many
Frenchmen are appalled that Paris, of all European cities, should have
welcomed Euro-Disney. French touchiness about the gradual decline of
their language is a European constant.
A few weeks ago the French European Affairs Minister, Alain
Lamassoure, was reported as saying all EU teenagers would ''have to''
study two European foreign languages. He spoke as the French were about
to assume the presidency of the EU for six months. At the same time, he
announced that France wanted to make only English, French, German,
Spanish, and Italian the core working languages of the EU.
You can imagine the reaction. First of all the Belgian Flemish and the
Dutch themselves were furious. The Greeks took the huff, as usual,
causing one wag to argue it was an act of cultural vandalism to
downgrade the language of Homer, Plato, and Papandreou.
France's proposal was that officials of the EU would be allowed to
speak their own language at meetings but they would be translated only
into one of the proposed five working languages, thus saving the EU lots
of money.
Mr Lamassoure stopped short of backing another French-inspired
suggestion to the effect that all EU officials should henceforth speak
in any language but their own. He responded gloomily to that brainwave.
''It would mean that all officials, except the British, spoke English,''
he supposed.
And he would be right, of course, because English is now the dominant
European language because it is almost every European's second tongue.
Indeed it is probably the dominant world language, if you turn a blind
eye to the billion-plus Chinese, although the Spanish would argue theirs
is the biggest language in the world because of its use in Latin
America.
A few days ago, Mr Lamassoure's boss, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe,
bowed to pressure and said France had ''never'' proposed reducing the
number of working languages. His comments followed a meeting, reported
to be frosty, with his Belgian counterpart, Frank Vandenbroucke, who
said that Belgium would veto the idea of having only five working
languages. ''And I think Dutch is a very important language,'' Mr
Vandenbroucke reminded him, to no-one's surprise.
There is much worse to come in the building of this Euro-Babel. The
ultimate linguistic crisis will arrive sometime early next century when
the eastern Europeans -- Poles, Hungarians, Romanians, Czechs, and
probably many more -- join the community which will expand to perhaps 25
members, assuming someone can wave a magic wand to pay for them.
At that point, a fleet of jumbo jets would needed to cart the
interpreters around Europe.
Mr Kinnock also joked last week that he had no intention of having
Welsh added to the EU's list of official tongues. No-one laughed. Even
for the world's most accomplished bureaucrats, the thought is too
appalling to be funny.

IT is true that 1994 was a good one for The Farmer. We can't complain
and, if a farmer can't complain -- well, that's a good year.
But lest you think The Farmer's life is all cakes and ale, let me tell
you of two accidents which have befallen me already since Christmas.
The first happened on Boxing Day when, the ground being dry and the
cattle on the slats being in great danger of becoming wet, I decided to
put out some slurry.
I've been struggling with these slurry tanks for some time, and Mossie
is determined that I should do away with them. ''If you're feeding straw
or silage, you'll always have them solid,'' he says.
That may be so, but the slats cost me a fortune and, with bedding
going as high as #10 a bale this year, I was loath to do as he advised.
Besides, I have come across a chemical called Pit-Boss, which claims to
take care of the problem of the slurry going solid.
Despite Mossie's advice that Pit-Boss is a complete waste of time,
I've been trying it, and it seems to be working. Each six-week cycle I
get more out. The last time it was a load and a half, and on Boxing Day
I got over three loads out of my first tank. And, do you know, slurry
treated with Pit-Boss doesn't smell (so bad)?
That is just as well.
I've done it before, as has every farmer, but I've never before given
myself a harling like I did on Boxing Day.
The slurry tanker discharges its liquid manure from the rear. It comes
flying out under pressure, and to make it spread nicely, it is sprayed
onto a metal plate from which it splashes up in the air to maybe 10
feet, and covers the field evenly to a width of perhaps 30 feet.
To increase the spraying effect, there is an attachment you put on
when discharging, which has the effect of narrowing the pipe. This
narrowed pipe can block.
And so it did on Boxing Day. To cut a long story short, instead of
reversing the pump so that the blockage could be pushed in, I tried to
unblock the pipe with a stick, intending to jump neatly out of the way
when the slurry lake was released. Sadly, my
jumping-neatly-out-of-the-way days are done. An arthritic knee refused
to jump, and fell down under the cascade of liquid manure.
They say it is lucky.
But there is no sign of that yet, for I had another reminder of how
dangerous our job can be on January the second.
During a break from snow-ploughing and pulling first-footers out of
drifts, I was taking in some bales of treated straw in case, with the
promise of a thaw, the cornyard might become impassable.
The bales are stacked in threes, one above two, and I was taking all
three at a time. It is a balancing feat which I do always, and which
landed a young neighbour in hospital last summer.
Of course, he didn't have a safety cab. I was quite safe, or so I
thought.
I was struggling so hard with wheelgrip on the icey ruts, that I
failed to notice the top bale falling backwards towards me until it was
too late.
I didn't feel the least bit threatened. But I should have.
The five-foot bale had come down onto the digger's exhaust chimney.
When I lowered the loader to let it down, the pipe went further in. And
when I lifted the loader up, it jammed the bale onto the front and roof
of the cab. To lift the bale clear of the lum, I would have to smash the
cab. I was stuck, but I still wasn't unduly worried, until I realised
that the blue stuff wasn't exhaust fumes, but smoke from burning straw.
I switched the engine off, but it was too late. The pipe was too hot.
I tried to smother the flames with my jacket -- and seemed to have
succeeded several times, but always the flames started up again.
It looked as though my poor digger was doomed to have a quarter of a
tonne of straw burn out on top of it. I set out to limit the damage by
dismantling the bale with my pen knife, though I could see that that
would let the air in, and I would be engulfed.
At last I noticed that the chimney had snapped. I was then able to
pull it out of the way. That left the bale resting on the lift arms of
the loader. With the strength given by panic, the thought of my
neighbours seeing what a state I was in, and the nagging doubts about
what was covered by the insurance -- and if the insurance was paid up --
I managed to shoulder the flaming mass off.
The total damage was a few fire blisters on my hands, one bale of
treated straw demolished, and a slight dent in the roof of the cab. To
set against that, I won't have to go to the barber for a week or two
longer.
I have learned two lessons. Two bales at a time is plenty, and carry a
small extinguisher in your tractor. Only time will tell if I will take
the lessons, but they are quite clear.
Of course, I'm not the only one who has had fun with the weather. The
Irishman who bought Mossie's outfarm was quite unprepared for the wild
horizontal snow which filled the roads level with the dykes. Luckily,
after Mossie's stewardship, the dykes weren't that high, but it was a
far cry from the gentle Irish snow.
''There was nothing about this in the particulars,'' he protested.
''Na, na. We tended to stress the good points. But you can mention the
snow when you're selling,'' said Mossie, helpfully.

<HEADLINE>No early solution to problem of transporting veal calves</HEADLINE>

THE debate on the transport of animals, and in particular the fate of
calves exported to Europe for the veal trade, continues to occupy the
best brains in the business -- but with little prospect of an early
solution being found.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave appears to be applying himself
to the problem quite seriously, and is tempering his approach to the
welfare lobby considerably.
Last November, the word terrorist was much in use whenever the
attempts to block the cross-Channel traffic in calves or lambs was
debated. If an impression could be given that all of those involved in
the dockside and airport protests were really terrorists, bent on the
overthrow of the State, then the authorities might be justified in
bulldozing them aside (metaphorically speaking of course).
The other popular line, taken up by the Minister and farmers' leaders,
was simply to repeat time and again: ''It is a legal trade.'' That was
never a terribly convincing argument for the general public. It was at
one time legal, after all, to send little boys up chimneys with a brush,
but it eventually came to be frowned upon.
Currently, of course, the trade is legal and, indeed, the Minister
argues that any attempt to end it unilaterally from this end, would put
Britain in the position of breaching European law. Those same European
laws, he points out, were invoked by us when we took exception to French
farmers burning lorry-loads of British lambs.
Nonetheless, the Minister is softening his stance towards what he
calls the responsible elements within the animal welfare lobby. He met
last week with the RSPCA and Compassion in World Farming (despite the
latter's involvement at Shoreham), and promised to do everything he
could to win support from other States for a ban on the veal crate
system in Europe.
The system has been banned in Britain since 1990, but it is estimated
that 500,000 calves a year are still exported from Britain into that
system in Holland and France.
In fact, Mr Waldegrave has identified the welfare lobby as an area
where British farmers, if they are sensible, should look for support.
British consumers will, he argues, increasingly like the idea that their
food comes from farms where animals are treated well.
An emphasis on welfare would also make economic sense in a world of
somewhat freer trade. He foresees problems in competing against, say,
far Eastern intensive production units, where welfare considerations
might not be to the fore. ''Would it therefore not be sensible to
persuade our consumers that it is right to pay a somewhat higher price
for real welfare benefits in the way animals are reared?,'' he asks.
The idea of seeking common ground between farmers and the welfare
lobby was also taken up at last week's Semex dairy conference in Glasgow
by my predecessor Ian Morrison. ''If you are doing the job properly, you
have nothing to fear over an occasional visit from an inspector,'' he
told his audience. ''It puts us one-up in Europe on the marketing
front.'' If Europe did not want to go along the welfare road -- hard
luck on them.
That may well be an attractive long-term strategy, but the short-term
battle could be a bloody one. The veal calf issue has caught the public
imagination. It is not for nothing, after all, that major supermarket
chains like Safeway and Sainsbury have stopped selling imported veal in
favour of the home-produced version.
Tesco say that their veal is raised under humane conditions in
Holland. Fear of a public boycott must be the main reason behind
promoting welfare as a selling point in that context.
Despite recent Court cases, most farmers will have little to fear on
the welfare front.
There is a delicate balance to be struck, however, in dealings with
the welfare lobby. Suppose the trade in veal calves is ended, will that
mean an end to protests about animal welfare? The answer must be no.
Mr John Forley, secretary-general of the National Sheep Association,
sees a danger in appeasement, and has warned that future targets could
be livestock markets and abattoirs. He is all for the Meat and Livestock
Commission raising a special levy to combat the publicity generated by
the welfare lobby.
He is perfectly correct in his assessment that livestock markets could
be a future target. Mr Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, has
indicated that he has a low opinion of some of the practices in the
markets and slaughterhouses. He regards them as a legitimate target, and
has plans to highlight what he regards as unappealing practices.
Advocates for Animals are also among those arguing for more animals to
be killed locally. Support for that campaign -- for more meat to be sold
on the hook, rather than on the hoof -- is reaching such a level that it
will not be easily dismissed.
Is there not some irony in the news that animal export flights may be
boycotted by Ministry vets on safety grounds -- not for the animals,
whose conditions they have to supervise, but for the vets themselves.
There is apparently a lack of seat belts for the human cargo.

FEW motorists would not confess to the occasional stirrings of road
rage. No-one could justify the disgraceful actions of a Metro driver who
was banned for 18 months last week for persistently refusing to allow a
Skoda to overtake him, but it is a situation that most of us would
recognise. There is no official pecking order on the roads, of course,
but natural justice dictates that old Skodas, Ladas, etc should not
aspire to overtake anything. Unfortunately for the Metro driver, the
Skoda was being driven by an off-duty policeman, who promptly took him
in charge.
Most road rage, say motoring organisations occurs after frustration
caused by traffic hold-ups. It is particularly evident on the motorways
approaching London and once in the city it can be worsened by parking
difficulties. Which driver, even in Glasgow and Edinburgh, has not
suffered impotent fury on seeing a vacant space stolen by someone else?
The value placed on parking in London is shown by the price tag on a
small space in St Johns Wood, 6ft 10in wide and 12ft long, which is
being offered for #10,000 or the equivalent of #5m an acre.
In New York, where the situation is much worse, parking disputes can
result in gun battles. Rush-hour gridlocks are now so common that
stressed executives use the time to undergo therapy. For #116 an hour
they employ Mobile Psychological Services which takes them across the
city in a chauffeur-driven limousine, complete with burgundy couch and a
doctor. In Britain, a cheaper antedote to road rage might be car bumper
stickers, as a literary genre they receive little attention, and are
usually associated with messages like ''I love Kirkcaldy'' or ''I am a
real Scot from Cambuslang''. A competition, however, has come up with
suggestions such as ''Alfa Romeo is Better Than None'', ''I Slow Down
for Hearses.'' It would be quite difficult to get angry if the offending
driver carried the slogan of one competitor -- ''Hands Off Gay
Elephants'' -- even if one did not agree with it.

Beirut, Sunday
ISRAELI planes attacked a Palestinian guerrilla base near the Lebanese
capital today, killing three people and forcing Beirut international
airport to close for an hour because of the danger to air traffic.
Officials said they shut the airport and diverted incoming flights
after Israeli planes rocketed targets in the hills only three miles
south of the airport.
It was the first time the airport had had to close since the end of
Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. It was often closed by shelling during the
war.
The raid was the third by Israeli warplanes into Lebanon in six days.
Three international flights were diverted to Larnaca, Cyprus,
officials said. The airport reopened later.
Lebanese and Palestinian security sources said three people were
killed as four Israeli jets swooped repeatedly to rocket the hills above
the coastal village of Na'ameh about 10 miles south of Beirut.
The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command (PFLP-GC) has a base in the hills.
Palestinian sources said the dead were not guerrillas.
Witnesses said the planes dived low 20 times and fired at least a
dozen rockets. An Israeli helicopter fired more rockets.
The jets could be seen turning above Beirut airport after firing their
rockets, Hizbollah (Party of God) radio said.
* Israeli cabinet ministers, their popularity plunging while inflation
is rising, agreed today to lower the volume on a public debate over who
was to blame for their problems.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal stoked the embers before the meeting,
sending a report to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin full of scathing
criticism of Finance Minister Avraham Shohat's economic policy.

THE contribution to Britain's trade from invisible items such as
services and tourism, is notoriously volatile, but there is no doubting
the upward trend in the benefit to the trade balance in recent years.
The largest contribution comes from financial services and the City of
London's role as the largest financial centre in Europe, if not the
world. These are not as volatile as some components of the invisibles
balance, but investment income does jump about from year to year. In the
first nine months of 1994, this came to about #6800m, compared with just
#2200m in the whole of 1993.
The 1993 net overseas surplus of UK financial institutions came to
#15.6bn on 1993, having doubled since 1985. The overall contribution of
invisibles as a whole to the trade balance came to #2029m in 1993 and is
heading for a record for 1994, with the figure in the first three
quarters reaching #5020m. The 1994 figures is not yet available.
In contrast, while Germany has a big surplus in visible trade, in
invisibles, it runs a $26bn deficit.
International trade in services has been growing faster than that for
actual goods for many years, now accounting for 40% of all world trade,
and the trend is set to continue as trade becomes more knowledge-based
and with the rapid global spread of telecommunications which is allowing
software processing to be carried out in any country.
Data on invisibles trade is bound to be more difficult to obtain and
less accurate than for goods and there is a discrepancy between total
receipts by countries and total payments of some $100bn a year, when
they should be identical.
Nevertheless, many countries have made efforts to improve the accuracy
of data and this is exaggerating the growth of world invisibles trade
somewhat, because greater accuracy invariably equates with higher
figures and revision to previous years is not easy.
Between 1984 and 1992, receipts are said to have soared from $747bn to
almost $1880bn, of which the UK share has slipped from 13% to just under
10%. This is still large compared to the size of the economy, given that
the American share is 15% despite its economy being much larger. The
decline in the UK's share may not be as marked as the figures suggest
because of exchange rate movements and the general volatility of
invisibles trade.
The UK is still thought to be the largest financial centre in the
world in a number of key areas, notably international bank lending,
foreign equity and international bond trading, international insurance
and foreign exchange transactions. Most of this is concentrated in the
City of London, though by international standards, Edinburgh is a large
centre in its own right. It is particularly strong in investment
management, where it has been a centre of expertise for generations.
Nowadays fund management groups are expanding their pension fund
management overseas and Dunedin, for example, has achieved notable
success in picking up contracts in America, where international
investment is beoming more important.
The City's success is clearly vital for the trade balance, but has not
been achieved without some disadvantages for the country. The
freewheeling deal-based culture which has encouraged the growth of the
City has restricted corporate investment and hamstrung long-term
planning and development. So companies concentrate more on corporate
activity to boost short-term growth rather than on building sound
long-term businesses, which has contributed to Germany's industrial
success.
The telephone number salaries available in the City have undoubtedly
siphoned off major talent which might otherwise have gone into industry.
Tourism is another major invisables component, where the UK has lost
out recently, moving from approximate balance to a deficit of $5500m in
1993. This is much affected by currency movements and is not a bad
result given attractions of sunnier climes.
The pattern is for more Britons to go overseas than foreigners come
here, but foreigners to spend more per head. In July and August this
year, some 6,000,000 people went abroad for holidays, spending #2230m,
or #370 per head, whereas 3,300,000 visitors came, spending #1630m, or
#490 each.
While the great majority of British holidaymakers go to Europe,
visitors are more balanced between Europeans and others. In the year to
October, 80% of Britons went to Europe, whereas 62% of visitors came
from Europe. But the feature of recent years is the way long-distance
travel has grown. North America and other countries account for 18% of
UK holiday destinations and there was a 24% rise in the number going
neither to Europe nor North America.
Historically, the UK had a consistent surplus in shipping but this has
long since disappeared, though the current deficit appears stable. The
same is true of civil aviation.
However, there is a raft of other services like business consultancy,
the arts and education, where Britain runs a large surplus. Historical
links and the English language are major pluses in these areas.

IT was the late Mr Magnus Williamson, a legendary figure in Edinburgh
council politics, who told me how, as secretary of the Labour group, he
had been instructed to write to a colleague undergoing a hospital
operation. ''We hope all goes well and that you are back with us soon,''
he penned. ''This motion was carried by 13 votes to 10.''
Nothing changes. The People's Party remains the institution where all
the most dangerous daggers come at you from behind.
When Bambi went to Brussels last week, he was not best pleased to read
an advertisement in the Guardian -- where else? -- which informed the
world that more than half of Labour's Euro-MPs were in favour of
retaining Clause 4 in their constitution. Never mind that they sincerely
believed in what they said; they had spoiled The Teeth's big moment, and
for that they had to suffer.
Mr Townee Blur read the Riot Act, Article 3, subsection 2, dissident
members for the warning of. Caps off, right, left, even further right,
turn and face the leader, you 'orrible infantile lot of layabouts. This
is not a party which likes debate, we are trying to get power, for
Gawd's sake.
Behind the bluster, the Edward G Robinson snarl, may I respectfully
inquire what message Her Majesty's Loyal Leader of the Opposition was
trying to put across to important Europeans and how, if it was so
interesting, it could be so easily obscured by the antics of a few
political dinosaurs? Has Townee something to tell us about a single
currency, the Social Chapter perhaps, subsidiarity, how he would make
the European Parliament into a more democratic institution? If so, I
must have missed it.
All I saw was a sulky popinjay, all dressed up and with little to
contribute except to insist he and his tailor's dummies would do
everything better than the incumbents in Government. If the British
people swallow that con, they deserve all they receive.
The year has not started too well for Townee. Silly old David Blunkett
thought he had it right on the education front -- let's get the kids out
of the private schools and into the state sector by fair means or foul.
Eh, no David, didn't we tell you, that was last year's policy. This time
we are not going to frighten anyone who might possibly support us. Get
back on the radio and recant, there's a good chap.
And there has been a little local difficulty in Edinburgh. Councillors
David Brown, Billy Fitzpatrick, and Derick ''Spike'' Wilson are
Socialists of the old order, working class and proud of it, ready to
take on the likes of me at every opportunity and to defend the poorest
in our society. Sure, Davie has a mind of his own and Billy has been
known to take a sherry at lunchtime but you know they are decent blokes.
They have just narrowly survived being thrown out of the ranks,
dishonourably discharged. Councillor Brown has served 25 years on the
local authority, was presented with a decanter -- not a lot of use as he
does not drink -- to mark the event. It was still a close-run verdict as
to whether he would be allowed to stand again.
What crime did these men commit? They expressed no confidence in a
chief executive who subsequently, to no-one's great sorrow, departed for
other employment. For that they were nearly keel-hauled.
If such a punishment can be handed out to councillors for voting on a
non-political matter what, one wonders, will happen to Tam Dalyell? For
he has dared to speak the words that have been banished from all Labour
lips -- no, not Clause 4, but the West Lothian question. Mr Brian
Wilson, a great pal of Sir Teddy Teapot's then, used to say it all the
time, but has since learned where his bread is likely to be buttered.
Not so Oor Tam. He still thinks devolution stinks and that, comrades, is
just not allowed.
Apparently all the chattering classes in Hampstead and Hammersmith are
talking about nothing else these days except the Scottish constitutional
issue. Do you believe that? No, neither do I, but newspaper leader
writers suddenly love pretending it is so.
I am a devolutionist who is utterly convinced the Labour plan will
simply not work. And everybody, from Townee down, knows that only too
well.
There is as much demand in England for regional assemblies as there is
for toe-nail eating contests. The scheme for a Welsh talking-shop is an
insult to the intelligence.
If and when Labour is prepared to reduce the number of Scottish MPs at
Westminster, if it is ready to have Parliaments in Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland, and England, when it is prepared to concede a proper
system of proportional representation, then we should take them
seriously. Until then, we should ponder about buying pigs in pokes, even
if they are terribly well turned out.
Mr Townee Blur will, I suspect, be given one chance to oust the Tories
from Westminster. Should he fail, there will be people of principle
within the Labour Party who will seek to re-assert the fundamental
beliefs that took them into politics in the first place.
I cannot believe that Mr Robin Cook, a great deal more able than
Townee and Gordy put together, will forever hold his peace, shuffled as
he has been so far out of sight as to be well-nigh invisible. There will
be an awful lot of Scottish Socialists looking to him for a lead.
Not that I seek to cause any trouble to anyone, you understand!

TAM Dalyell is an unlikely candidate for sainthood. Nor would he be
better suited to martyrdom, though this seems a more likely fate if his
local constituency party continues to be upset by his determination to
polish the West Lothian Question and press it on a party which does not
want to hear such awkward dissent to its devolution proposals. The West
Lothian Question, dormant for so long, is not worthy of the fearsome
reputation it has acquired. It poses a problem which is of particular
relevance to the current constitutional dispensation. Labour's proposals
for devolution go beyond that, for they are framed in the context of
constitutional reform which is a process long overdue. In this new
situation the question of representation, and who is able to vote on
what, will have to be looked at dispassionately; it is not beyond the
wit of politicians to arrive at a solution which is fair and just.
Nevertheless, Tam Dalyell will continue to fight on what he regards as
an important question of principle. This will include his speech in
Leicester this evening in which he will say that devolution will lose
the Labour Party the next election. In the light of opinion polls last
week in which a majority of those polled across Britain were in favour
of some form of devolution for Scotland, this seems unlikely. It will
not prevent Tam from maintaining the opposite point of view. His
determination to do so has upset some party members, but in doing this
he maintains a long and honourable tradition of politicians who have
caused problems for their colleagues because of issues in which they
believe. There are examples of this on both sides of the House of
Commons. Mr Malcolm Rifkind resigned as Shadow Scottish Secretary in
1976 over Mrs Thatcher's opposition to devolution. His opinions on this
appear to have changed, despite his evident discomfort in the Commons
last week when Mr Major was at his most alarmist on the subject. Mr
Teddy Taylor resigned from the Heath Government over the Common Market
in 1971 and has maintained his stance since then. Some of the current
batch of Tory rebels on Europe may qualify for inclusion in this
honourable band though others may be described merely as eccentrics.
Nevertheless, the question of political dissent is an important one.
Members of Parliament are whipped, and sometimes in an oppressive
manner. It is true that party discipline is necessary if an effective
parliamentary presence is to be maintained, but the public is not
pleased at the sight of elected members in perpetual and meek
acquiescence to the views of party managers. A rigid parliamentary
system like our own is enhanced by members who go against the grain, not
just on a whim, but on issues which they feel are important. Tam Dalyell
is wrong on the question of devolution, but he is right to argue with
persistence.

THE marketing campaign is well underway for the sale of the
Government's remaining 40% stake in National Power and Powergen, the two
electricity generators of England and Wales.
The two companies will be grateful that they have not become embroiled
in the political controversy that has surrounded the regional
electricity companies of England and Wales. Although they have thus far
escaped the political arena, they still have to contend with regulatory
concerns.
National Power and PowerGen have actually seen greater competition in
their markets than has yet occurred in either UK telecommunications or
electricity distribution.
Because the generation market is not a monopoly, the generating
companies (Gencos) are not regulated as tightly as other UK utilities.
However, their operations are overseen by the regulator, Offer, who has
imposed a price cap on electricity prices in the wholesale pool for
1994/95 and 1995/96 to further strengthen competition in the
marketplace.
In addition, Offer has also proposed that within the next two years
National Power and PowerGen should use ''all reasonable endeavours to
negotiate the sale or disposal of 4000MW and 2000MW respectively of
coal-fired or oil-fired generation plant''. However, both companies have
received assurances that shareholders' interests must not be prejudiced
and any disposals must be at realistic prices.
The regulatory background to all the privatised utilities has
traditioanlly appeared to be a relatively one-way street with the
companies having various new rules and price caps imposed from above. It
does not have to be this way although some form of firm but fair
regulation is vital, given the practical near monopoly that almost all
the privatised utilities continue to enjoy.
Writing in a personal capacity in ''Regulating Our Utilities'', David
Souter, assistant secretary and head of research of the National
Communications Union, argues that heated debates often occur precisely
because there are no clear objectives and no openness on the fact that
there are enormous differences of opinion on the appropriate objectives
of regulation.
The aim of regulation, as in many other areas of public policy, must
be to balance the different interests of the relevant stakeholders --
consumers, producers, shareholders, employees and so on.
In addition, there are the interests which the community -- present
and future -- has as a stakeholder and which can only be represented by
the Government acting as a stakeholder on its behalf.
Given the difficulties in achieving a fair compromise between these
vested interests, there is a role for Government ministers to decide on
the trade-offs. The choice is whether they prefer a higher price in
return for better quality or more variety in the domestic market at the
possible price of losing some international force if such a policy
prevented a world-scale player emerging.
Mr Souter believes the Government's objectives in utility regulation
should cover a number issues aside from just promoting competition.
These would include the modernisation and quality of network
infrastructure, regional equity in the distribution of utility services,
research and development, quality standards and the international
competitiveness of UK utilities and their suppliers.
He proposes the establishment of accountable regulatory commissions
for each of the relevant industrial sectors of energy, communications,
transport and water. These would replace the individual regulators for
each industry that currently exist. In addition, he advocates that
consumer interests be represented by separate consumer bodies for each
of the four main utility sectors.
The focus on competition in isolation may be futile in the sense that
true competition in the utilities is likely to be impossible to achieve.
Michael Waterson, Professor of Economics at the University of Warwick,
writing in the same report, says that while the utilities differ from
each other in many regards, the network aspects of most of them makes
the model of competition non-achieveable. In particular, the regulation
of distribution will have to continue in the long term, whatever happens
on supply, in order to deal with the monopoly elements that a
network-dependent product involves.
Professor Waterson believes that now may be the time to change the
nature of regulation away from the price cap (RPI-X) system. While this
undoutedly helped increase efficiency in the early days he suggests that
it will become increasingly inappropriate.
This is thought to be the case particularly since it now incorporates
complications and commonly allows cost pass-throughs and because of
factors like diversification by utility firms outside the regulated
business.
Rate of return regulation is thought to offer few advantages over the
RPI-X system but alternative methods which could be examined include
linking price in the regulated sector inversely to profit in the whole
firm (over both regulated and unregulated sectors). In addition,
Professor Waterson believes that a potentially valid case remains for
public ownership of the core elements of regulated industries.
As the General Election increasingly looms large on the horizon,
regulatory matters surrounding the privatised utilities are likely to
become an even bigger political football. On the one side, the Labour
Party focuses on what it sees as excess profits and the generous
renumeration packages for privatised industry executives.
Meanwhile, the Conservative Party continues to believe that free
competition and minimal Government interference are the best ways of
satisfying customers and shareholders.
There are flaws in both these approaches which, as usual when dealing
with politicians, are polarised at opposite extremes. In reality, the
general public would be happier on the middle ground. While recognising
the need to improve efficiency, there are general concerns about prices
and customer service.
Whoever wins the General Election would be wise to try to achieve in
their regulatory policy for the utilities, a more equitable balance
between the interests of all parties both service providers and
customers.

Waterson, is published by the Institute for Public Policy Research.

Salute to a man who always had Scotland's interests at heart.
AUTHORISED biographies tend to be written after their subject's death.
I was privileged to write my one of Sir Alexander Gibson while he was
still very much alive. It meant I could talk to him, often for hours on
end, in his home surroundings in Glasgow, and take part for several
months, if only in a marginal sort of way, in his daily life with his
wife, Veronica.
Even after his retirement from the Scottish National Orchestra and
Scottish Opera, he was busier than people thought. He was poised between
the end of his ''official'' duties as Scotland's leading conductor and
musical director, and the golden years that good conductors reach around
the age of 70, when their careers enter a new and often richer phase,
when they can choose the works that interest them, and ignore the rest.
Though it is sad that Alex has been deprived of that, he was always
lucky enough to do most of the things he wanted. He had an orchestra and
opera company at his disposal. But that they happened both to be in the
same city was a convenience that ultimately became a problem. His life
became divided -- some would say torn -- between one and the other, and
eventually the wear and tear began to show.
But at its height, in the 1960s and 70s, it was an extraordinary
double act, and whenever he confided one or another of his future plans
in me I would marvel at its audacity. The Ring and The Trojans were its
obvious high points -- even Bernard Levin, an obsessive Ring collector,
was lured to Glasgow -- but there were more than enough others to
establish him as the leading British opera conductor of his generation.
Yet operatically it was a tragically unfinished career. His Ring cycle
which matured enormously from its beginning with Die Walkure in 1966 to
its grand completion in 1971, was never repeated, as it would have been
in any other country that supposedly cared about opera (the Scottish
Arts Council, which prevented this happening, should hang its head with
shame). The Parsifal, Don Carlos, Benvenuto Cellini, and Die Frau ohne
Schatten, which he also planned during this period, never took place.
Scottish Opera's repertoire still badly lacks all these major works,
though there were compensations in Henze's Elegy for Young Lovers and a
Wozzeck of quite startling ferocity, which released, as one London
critic put it, all these whips and scorpions of the score. Was it a
career that peaked too soon? Though it is true that some of Gibson's
finest performances, both operatic and orchestral, took place when he
was in his 40s. Many memorable things came later. His feeling for
Puccini, and particularly for Madama Butterfly, remained strong, indeed
overwhelming, until the end.
Butterfly, at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre last month, was the last
work I heard him conduct. It was a performance of remarkable breadth,
which stretched the music considerably beyond its normal duration. Yet
sacrificed nothing in terms of intensity of expression and quicksilver
changes of instrumental colouring. Every Puccini pause was savoured to
its maximum, every phrase shaped to its fullest. At the end he took what
seemed an inordinate time to move from pit to stage to take his bow with
members of the cast. He had become in recent years conspicuously less
mobile than in the days when he strode lithely on to the platform. But
when, at last, he emerged from the wings, the cast greeted him with
relief, and a man behind me in the circle exclaimed, with obvious
affection, ''There he is.''
For most of his career, he looked young for his years. His capacity
for work, and for involvement in every aspect of music, administrative
as well as creative, was incredible. He never, even as a guest
conductor, confined himself to a well-tried handful of pieces, but was
always prepared to tackle new things. A work by Luciano Berio that was
no more than a series of musical punctuation marks? He made mesmerising
sense of it. An almost static meditation for clarinet, harp, and strings
by Harrison Birtwistle? He made it enthralling. An opera set in the
Roman forum? He made it as relevant as a squabble in the House of
Commons.
The last of these was Iain Hamilton's Catiline Conspiracy, a work of
daunting complexity with which Gibson persevered because he believed in
it, the way he believed in a great deal of Scottish music that his
Austrian predecessors in Scotland, Karl Rankl and Hans Swarowsky, would
have dismissed as unperformable. It was our good luck that he won the
SNO from the Dutch conductor, Willem van Otterloo, who was his fellow
contender for the conductorship in 1958.
Otterloo, though a perfectly adept musician, would hardly have had
Scotland's interests at heart, as Gibson did. During the time I spent
researching my book at his exquisite turn-of-the-century house in
Cleveden Gardens, I learned little about his private thoughts -- which,
to the end, remained inscrutably private -- but I learned a great deal
about how his life worked, and about the invasions of his time by novice
conductors, aspiring singers, hopeful interviewers, old friends.
He devoted himself to many causes from which he would derive no
obvious personal benefit. A recent performance of Sibelius's Sixth
Symphony at the RSAMD is spoken of with awe by those who heard it. His
recent work on behalf of the Scottish Musicians' Benevolent Fund
prompted him to reject a chance to conduct Beethoven's Missa Solemnis --
a work he adored -- in Sweden, because the one would have coincided with
the other. That was what Scotland meant to him. If, to some extent, he
abandoned the prospect of an international career to achieve it, it has
been to Scotland's benefit.

Sir Alexander Gibson, the conductor who made Scotland sit up and
listen, died on Saturday. Music critic Michael Tumelty examines the life
and legacy of a great innovator.
THERE is one thing that nobody could ever, ever, take away from Sir
Alexander Gibson. And that is that he stands, firmly written into the
history of Scotland's cultural life, as a linchpin. People still idly
speculate: what if Alex (as he insisted on being called) hadn't returned
to Scotland in the late fifties?
It's hypothetical. But there was no Scottish Opera, no Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, none of the plethora of smaller groups spawned from
these organisations, no systematic championship of Scottish composers,
and little coherent or strategic function in Scottish musical affairs.
Sure the Scottish National Orchestra existed. It had since the 1890s.
But it had only been a full-time professional orchestra since 1950. It
wasn't full size. It had no recordings. It had only toured abroad once,
last century. It didn't even have a reputation south of the Border.
It was, in the words of a former leader of the orchestra, ''a rather
nondescript organisation without much reputation, by the highest
standards''.
One man changed all that. Everything. One man with a vision and a
mission. Alex Gibson, whose death on Saturday afternoon has left
Scotland's huge musical community in shock.
There was no particular hint that young Alex Gibson was destined for
great musical achievement and a place in his country's history books.
Born in Motherwell, his mother could sing and his father, he said, was
sensitive to music. But at Dalziel High School young Alex was noted to
have a ''good ear''.
So he was sent to piano lessons and, by his third year, was determined
to pursue music, travelling to Glasgow on Saturdays to hear the Scottish
Orchestra (as it was then called) at the St Andrew's Hall. By 18 he had
diplomas for piano performance and was an Associate of the Royal College
of Organists.
A four-year stint in the Army saw him become a member of the Royal
Signals band at Catterick where he became an exponent of sundry piano
concertos accompanied by military band arrangements.
Subsequently, at the Royal College of Music in London, he attempted to
take up conducting as a study, was thwarted by the college authorities,
and promptly formed his own student orchestra. It was there that he had
his first taste of conducting opera, the form that was to become his
very personal specialism.
In the late forties he played chamber music extensively in London and
throughout England, while a music prize won in 1950 enabled him to study
conducting in Salzburg. By 1952 he was already a repetiteur at Sadler's
Wells Opera in London (he had been snapped up by them while still at
college) and assistant conductor to Iain Whyte with the BBC Scottish
Orchestra in Glasgow.
After his two-year contract with the BBC Scottish expired, Gibson was
offered initially a conductorship at Sadler's Wells, and eventually the
post of musical director, the youngest in the history of the company. He
was just 31.
It was at that point in 1957 (he had already guest-conducted the SNO)
that he brought Sadler's Wells to Edinburgh on tour, a visit where his
biographer, colleague Conrad Wilson, confessed himself ''astounded'' by
the mature change in Gibson.
In 1959, Gibson came home. Though his star was in the ascendant in
London, in both orchestral and operatic fields, he had planned what he
might do should he ever return to Scotland. The SNO was living on guest
conductors, none of whom was resident. Its repertoire was thin, with
entire areas of neglect. There was no dedication to British -- far less
Scottish -- music. Composers such as Sibelius were ignored.
He was headhunted, came back, took over, and fired a rocket up the
preconceptions of the establishment. The youngest conductor of the
orchestra, and its first Scot, he immediately programmed the seven
symphonies of Sibelius, and marked his card for Scottish music by
causing an uproar at the Edinburgh Festival with exiled Scot Iain
Hamilton's Sinfonia.
The repertoire -- and the size of the orchestra -- began to expand. As
did a secret plan, hatched in London, where Gibson and a Scottish mafia
of singers had all been working at Sadler's Wells. ''Why,'' one of them
once said to me, ''are we all doing this down here and not in our own
opera company in Scotland?''
And thus, with a cadre of musical and business associates and
advisers, did Gibson form Scottish Opera in 1962. From its modest
beginnings, Scottish Opera has grown into Scotland's largest cultural
organisation, taking the biggest slice of government revenue. Initially,
the SNO was the house band for the opera, but as its own activities
expanded (as did the work of the opera company) other orchestral forces
were required, out of which was formed the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
When the SCO, too, went independent, Scottish Opera formed its own house
orchestra.
Though this was not his initial plan, Alex's fingerprints and
influence were all over the rapidly developing Scottish scene, including
the vast number of smaller groups that these big organisations spawned.
Scarcely a musician in them had not passed under Alex's influence at one
time or another.
His achievements with the SNO were immense: increasing the size of the
orchestra to full-scale symphonic proportions, first British
performances of music by Schoenberg and Stockhausen, establishment of a
modern music series that developed into Musica Nova, a fully-fledged
festival, tireless championship in his early years of Scottish music and
composers, the proper introduction of a foreign touring programme for
the orchestra, a recording contract that saw the reputation of the
orchestra proliferate.
Honours poured his way. Awarded the CBE in 1967, knighted 10 years
later, and a host of awards from cities and doctorates from academic
institutions. He was dubbed Scotland's Mr Music. He was particularly
proud of being awarded the Sibelius Medal for his championship and
understanding of that composer's music.
Inevitably, in his 25 years as principal conductor and musical
director of the SNO and the same number of years as artistic director
and music director of Scottish Opera, he attracted controversy. He was
accused of favouring one over the other, of being unable to give both
the attention and energy they required. The famous Gibson beat (or
apparent lack of it) was an endless source of argument over the years.
He made jokes about it himself.
And, arguably, he stayed too long with both organisations. About 10
years ago he said to me that there was no way a relationship of that
length could be sustained without a feeling of staleness creeping in on
all sides.
As conductor laureate of Scottish Opera and honorary president of the
(now) Royal SNO he has appeared regularly with these organisations in
recent years. Invariably, when he produced his best, there was always a
singer around. He had what Dame Janet Baker -- before she retired,
Britain's greatest singer -- yesterday called ''a rare gift, a real
affinity'' with singers.
Before Christmas he completed what was to be his last session with
Scottish Opera. Appropriately, it was with a Puccini opera, Madama
Butterfly. When he was on form Alex could float a Puccini phrase like no
other. Even with the most familiar music, he could still make you weep.
He is gone, but he has left his mark. And it is indelible.
Sir Alexander is survived by his wife, Lady Veronica, and four
children.
THE TRIBUTES
Dame Janet Baker, singer: ''I first worked with Alex in the sixties
with the SNO. We did concerts and tours, then I worked with him at
Scottish Opera. He had a very rare gift, an affinity with singers: he
took care of us, he understood the problems singers have. It was a great
ability. He took immense care not to drown us, to encourage us, to allow
us to be our best selves. He knew his singers so well, where to leave us
for a moment, where to push us on. It was a gift few conductors possess
and he will be terribly missed.''
Morrison Dunbar, chairman, Royal Scottish National Orchestra: ''We've
lost a great Scot and a truly great man. Nobody this century has done
more for music in Scotland than Alex Gibson. This orchestra owes him a
deep debt of gratitude.''
Paul Hughes, chief executive, Royal Scottish National Orchestra: ''I
came into the orchestra with the constant of Alex always being there. He
was linked directly to everything on the Scottish scene. He was an
extremely modest man: we were in the process of planning his 70th
birthday concert; we wanted him to programme music that would be his
choice. Typically he wanted a programme that would show off the
orchestra. I'll miss him as a friend: there are no new problems facing
the orchestra that he hasn't lived through. It is the end of an era.''
Scottish Opera. Company statement: ''The whole of Scottish Opera is
deeply saddened to learn of Sir Alex's death. Each member of the company
held him in tremendous esteem and valued the sense of continuity he
provided within the company he founded. Although the classical music
world in Scotland has lost one of its major figures, his legacy will
continue to exist through Scottish Opera and the other organisations
with which he shared his outstanding musicianship.
James Loughran, conductor, fellow Scot, and near contemporary of Sir
Alex Gibson: ''I'm shattered by the news. I've known Alex a long, long
time. I was already working with the SNO before he arrived in 1959. At
that time the orchestra was associated with visiting conductors, and a
conservative repertoire. When Alex came there was commitment; everything
seemed to take on a fresh look. He was determined to get things moving
in Glasgow in a very short time. Scottish Opera, the SNO, everything he
did -- his personality was at the core of making it all work.''
Pat Lally, Leader of Glasgow city council: ''There is no doubt that
Sir Alexander Gibson was the architect of much of the cultural life of
Scotland as it is today. It is doubtful if Glasgow would ever have been
City of Culture had it not been for the foundations laid by Sir
Alexander Gibson and his work with the RSNO, Scottish Opera, and the
Theatre Royal. His contribution was immeasurable. He is a great loss to
Glasgow and to Scotland.''
Thomas Wilson, senior Scottish composer: ''He was a catalyst, a
keystone for Scottish music, largely responsible for the rebirth of
music in the sixties, through Scottish Opera, the SNO, and his
championship of Scottish music. Alex seemed to bring it all together. I
got the feeling in the early days that he was assessing the potential,
then when he was ready things started to move. He changed the face of
Scottish music.''
Ian Smith, Scottish organiser, Musicians Union: ''His contribution to
music and musicians throughout Scotland and the world can never be
underestimated.''
Thomson Smillie, general director Kentucky Opera (with which Sir Alex
worked regularly): ''He was a very great man and a profound musician who
enhanced the fame of his native land as perhaps no other Scot this
century. His impact was international and he is deeply mourned here in
Louisville by the artists with whom he worked for 10 years.''

Manila, Sunday
POPE John Paul ended a triumphant visit to the Philippines today by
drawing the biggest crowd of his 17-year reign and rejuvenating a papacy
some people feared was going into decline.
Vatican officials said it was the largest turnout yet for the Pope,
beating even the welcome he received when he returned to his native
Poland for the first time as pontiff in 1979.
After a smaller than expected crowd at his first big public Mass
yesterday, today's event was a stunning explosion of Filipino Catholic
faith.
Rizal Park in the middle of the capital Manila was jammed to bursting
and all the roads were so crammed with people hoping for a glimpse of
the Pope that he had to abandon plans to drive to the Mass.
People perched on top of vehicles, traffic lights and anywhere
offering a vantage point to catch a glimpse of the leader of the world's
900 million Roman Catholics were disappointed.
Instead, he was flown the two miles by helicopter to emerge on a high
stage to the adulation of millions of local people gathered for the
service to mark World Youth Day.
The 74-year-old Pope, forced to cancel foreign tours to the United
States and Belgium last year after undergoing bone replacement surgery,
was clearly delighted with his reception on the first stop in his
four-nation tour.
''He is delighted,'' said chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, who put today's crowd at four million.
The Pope even turned the silver topped black cane he now uses to help
him walk into a stage prop at one point, entertaining hundreds of
thousands of people at a youth vigil last night by twirling it like
Charlie Chaplin.
There was also a diplomatic success in getting a delegation from

his conservative doctrine.

WILLIE HARKNESS, the former SFA president who died aged 76 at the
weekend, was one of a rare breed of football administrators, not just
because he actually played he game at professional level, but also
because he was ever willing to say what he thought. If occasionally the
man who served alongside him during Harkness's five-year term, secretary
Ernie Walker, might have preferred a less enthusiastic public face, the
two men worked well together to establish a sound financial base for the
SFA to invest in the Scottish game.
A lover of Queen of the South, the game in general and perhaps the
most gregarious president the association has ever boasted, Harkness was
quiet spoken but held strong views and was never willing merely to be a
figurehead. Which is not to say that he had a distaste for world travel
or friendly, lengthy blethers over a beer or two.
He had a long association with his home town, Dumfries, and his
beloved Queen of the South. He played for the club but would tell you
that, according to his dad, ''never had a good game for them''. He
became a scout, shareholder, manager, director, and chairman before
becoming president of the SFA just before the World Cup finals in 1978.
Many a lesser man might well have decided that first foreign trip was
enough.
The president had to stand firm with Walker as they endured the
disgrace of Willie Johnston, sent home after taking a banned substance,
the rows over bonuses, and humiliating team performances.
However, he lived to fight another day and, in fact, was given an
extension to the normal term of office, from four to five years, in
order to lead Scotland into the next World Cup finals, in Spain in 1982.
He was awarded the CBE for his services to football a year later.
No-one enjoyed life more than Willie Harkness. His death is a harsh
reminder that we live in an era when individualists, or ''characters'',
have become almost extinct.
He is survived by his wife Jean, a son and two daughters.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie embarks on a royal tour
VERY time I stand at the Linn of Dee, north of Braemar and watch the
torrent of water, or gaze up to the heights above the valley. It is easy
to understand why Queen Victoria fell in love with Deeside and gave it
the prefix ''royal''. For the River Dee is one of the great northern
rivers, tumbling from its source high in the Cairngorms, curving along
stretches swift or slow as the valley narrows or broadens, through the
little communities of Braemar, Ballater, Aboyne and Banchory, down to
the sea south of Aberdeen.
There are spectacular mountains on either side and the river winds
past splendid castles, historic monuments, fields and fine gardens. In
summer, the small towns have their Highland gatherings and games, and
Deeside is full of history, fought over by the warlike families who
built Braemar and Crathes Castles, and many more fortresses and towers.
The ruined Knock Castle from 1600, west of Ballater, is a tragic
reminder of the ferocity of those old clan feuds. Here, seven sons of
the Gordon family, at work in the fields, were slaughtered. The shock
killed their old father, wiping out the male line in one day.
At the start of the 1715 Rising, the Jacobites set up their standard
in Braemar and, after the Forty-Five, Braemar Castle became a garrison
fortress. The real Macbeth fought his last battle in Lumphanan Woods,
near the village of Kincardine O'Neil.
Somehow, Deeside seems to sum up all the things that bring people to
Scotland, and get Scots themselves touring. For it is not just looking
and sight-seeing. Deeside is a wonderful outdoor world, with valleys and
mountains. Braemar, at the head of the valley is a fine centre for
experienced hill-walkers or climbers, but all Deeside can scarcely be
bettered for glorious walks, easy or energetic, and for riding, fishing
and canoeing on river or loch, golf, and winter skiing -- and solitude.
You can walk or ride for hours without meeting a soul.
There are cycles for hire in most towns but we needed car wheels for
travel. Deeside no longer has its ''royal'' railway, from the days when
Queen Victoria and her vast entourage arrived at Ballater. The
near-perfect Victorian railway building still has its own royal waiting
room, all panelled walls and ornate, decorated ceiling, fallen on hard
times, alas, as a local authority office.
But the building has a good restaurant and shops and, close by, a
traditional sweetmaker -- a working confectioner rather than a
showplace, where we watched the sweetmakers cooking 26 different types
of boilings, plus Edinburgh rock, fudges and more. The temptation was so
great I did not stay long enough to find out whether they really use a
ton of sugar a week. Ballater also has the distinction of having no less
than 22 restaurants and cafes.
The Grampian Region as a whole boasts 70 castles and the Dee valley
has several of the best. On the A93 from Perth, past the ski-lift at
Glenshee -- also a popular, though chilly, summer expedition -- the
first is Braemar Castle, owned by the Farquharson family, though built
in 1682 by the Earl of Mar as a stronghold against them. It has a stormy
history -- burnt by Black John Farquharson in 1689, restored as a
garrison post after the Forty-Five -- but still has the feel of a family
house though it is no longer the main Farquharson home.
Above the road east, it is easy to pick out Crathie Church, where the
royal family worships in summer, attracting huge Sunday crowds to see
the Queen walk up the steep path. This is, nevertheless, an austere
Presbyterian church with few concessions to opulence, except perhaps its
Iona marble communion table, royal pew, and royal porch.
Not far away is Queen Victoria's Balmoral. The grounds, with statues
that even include royal dogs, are open in summer (when the royal family
is not there). Inside only the ballroom is open to the public with
exhibitions of painting and porcelain. One mile away, Lochnagar
Distillery was founded in 1845 by John Begg, who was not slow to invite
his neighbour to visit. She did, the next day. Today, anyone can visit
this traditional, small distillery which makes one of the most expensive
single malts, Royal Lochnagar Selected Reserve at #95 a bottle. The
distillery tour ends with a dram.
Aboyne, set around a green, holds the first Highland Games of the
year, and is also a good centre for walks, in an area which once held
many more people than it does today. Taking the road up Glen Tanar, by
looking carefully, I came across the site of an old village, some
hundred houses strong.
Going even further back are the huge linked settlements of
hut-circles, cairns, kists and fortifications, going back to 2000BC and
further, in Howe of Cromar, largely unknown except to experts, north of
the Dee, between Lochs Kinord and Davan, the site is in Muir of Dinnet
National Nature Reserve, a place for carrying binoculars to see deer and
birdlife. But something large flying is as likely to be a glider from
nearby Deeside Gliding Club, which offers trial membership to visitors.
Banchory is the last town before Aberdeen. It was home of the famous
fiddle composer, James Scott Skinner, and the Strathspey and Reel
Society gives a chance to hear the living tradition at its monthly
meetings. Two castles around here are in the care of the National Trust
for Scotland, Crathes Castle, the sixteenth century home of the Burnett
(once Burnard family), has turrets, a spiral staircase, beautiful
painted ceilings . . . and a ghost, the Green Lady.
One of its greatest treasures is the Horn of Leys, presented by Robert
the Bruce to Alexander Burnard. There are three acres and more of walled
garden, everything that a gardener could want, with elegantly shaped yew
hedges planted in 1702, which take three weeks to clip each year.
Crathes's 600 acres can bring in as many as a thousand visitors a day
who simply vanish into the park, woods and marked trails, or browse over
the nursery's plants for sale. There is space enough for all.
Nearby Drum Castle is not as well known, but deserves to be as one of
the three oldest in Scotland. Its great square tower is thirteenth
century, built by Richard Cementarius (sic) the King's master mason, who
was Provost of Aberdeen.
From Drum, it is but a short hop to Peterculter, and into modern
Aberdeen, a city very different from the days of Cementarius or even
Queen Victoria, at the end of some 60 delightful miles that seem to
bridge past and present.

THEY may be only a small north London fringe venue, but Nick Kent's
Tricycle has got one hell of a triumph on its hands. I can't think of a
better way to wipe away the new-year blues than this sparkling,
surefooted revival of the vintage 1978 Broadway hit, Ain't Misbehavin',
which joyously recreates the spirit, the wit, the sheer energy of that
master of swing and boogie, Fats Waller.
Packed with classics such as Honeysuckle Rose, I'm Gonna Sit Right
Down and Write Myself a Letter, and a dozen other songs that have gone
down in popular music history, Ain't Misbehavin' is primarily a musical
showcase. Yet somehow it also manages to be something more. Nick Kent
and Gillian Gregory's clever production -- presumably based on the
original show -- stages these songs as if half in a rundown, honky-tonk
Harlem backroom, half in up-town club land, a perfect evocation of
Waller's own life and times set against Bunny Christie's enlarged
black-and-white piano ''ivories''.
The result is irresistible if occasionally hopelessly unreconstructed.
''Find out what they like/then let them have it,'' sings the sassy
Melanie Marshall and Debby Bishop without any apparent subtext. Yet Ray
Shell brings a gleeful extravagance to his duet with Marshall in
Honeysuckle Rose, as if only too aware of its outrageous sexual
innuendo.
Sean Palmer's Viper's Drag, Bishop's Squeeze Me and the wholly
poignant Black and Blue, detailing racial despair, are other high points
in an evening that, marvellously set off by Clement Ishmael at the piano
and a four-piece combo, could run all the way to the West End.

SUDDENLY, they are watching for the pendulum theory of politics to
operate. It is a fatalist concept much fancied by seasoned operators and
first articulated, it seems, in Washington by a Republican Speaker of
the House, Joe Cannon.
Down-to-earth politicians, who never quite trust opinion polls, keep
their eye on the pendulum. Fittingly, Speaker Cannon (1903-11) was about
as earthy as you can get. He was variously known as ''Uncle'' Joe,
''Foul-mouthed'' Joe, and the ''hayseed member for Illinois''.
President Taft warned Alice Roosevelt Longworth never to get between
Cannon and his spittoon. This was after none was provided for a Cannon
poker game, so he opted for the umbrella stand instead.** Needless to
say, this ripe steamer lived to 90, and managed a successful political
career, although hardly a sanitised, politically correct one.
His argument was ''the pendulum will swing back''; which of course is
a precise job description of pendulums. (I wonder, if Uncle Joe could
hit a spittoon, could he hit a pendulum and stop it?)
Maybe there should be a statue to him in Parliament Square. It could
stand as a permanent warning to Members of Parliament of the fickle
nature of political mood. We have seen what pendulums can do.
Look at what has happened to John Major since he won his election in
1992 with the highest-ever Tory poll and was rated for a while as the
most popular Prime Minister in living memory. Now the Tories have the
lowest-ever ratings and the most unpopular Prime Minister.
We can imagine what the ''hayseed'' member would have said about
President Clinton's debacle last year in the Congressional elections.
Clinton swept Bush out of office on a ''new-look'' tide, only to find
now that the Democrats have lost control of Congress for the first time
in 40 years.
The topical view of the power of the pendulum is that it might just be
on the swing. Again, the masterful observation of Harold Wilson that a
week is a long time in politics is being proved. Last week was such a
week. Mr Blair's honeymoon with his party ended and some of the gloss
was erased, while Mr Major looked at long last somewhat less accident
prone.
Instead of screeds in the newspapers and hours of broadcasting time of
analysis on the latest Government problems -- and new ones had been
cropping up weekly -- the media turned its attention to the Labour
Party. Blair policy, and arguments about it, are beginning to emerge.
Education, putative repeal of the ''nationalisation'' Clause 4, rail
de-privatisation (will he, won't he?), and, yes, even devolution have
caused him problems. We haven't got anywhere near taxation policy yet,
although the Labour Party is eager to know if it is still in the
business of re-distributing wealth.
It has to be said that Mr Blair has asserted himself. He shot down his
Education spokesman David Blunkett on the issue of VAT on school fees.
He castigated his left-wing Euro-MPs for their ''discourteous'' and
''infantile'' attack on his plans for Clause 4. He told his Shadow
Cabinet that they must clear any remarks about money with him or Mr
Gordon Brown.
But it also has to be said that the form of assertion was confined to
treating quickly an incipient dry-rot in his own authority. He was
trying to re-impose tight discipline rather than put the policy
arguments. In this sense it was strictly defensive.
This of course was a gain for Mr Major who has grown unaccustomed to a
Labour Leader on the defensive. He was ebullient when Blair tried to
goad him -- again, defensively -- on devolution. Labour is not yet ready
with the detail of devolution, particularly in England, so Blair had to
fall back on pressing Major on Tory policy way back in 1974.
This seemed a thin line of attack in view of the fact that Major was
not even an MP then and the Tories were for an Assembly (non
tax-raising) and Labour against. It was easily rebutted by Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang who said: ''We were wrong then and Labour was right,
now we are right and Labour is wrong.''
Familiar arguments, pro and anti, were trotted out again, but this
time with immense display in the English media. This served to draw
attention to the fact that Labour has at least one committed policy, but
not the detail to convince.
The view seemed to be that it was time for Blair to argue the
principle aggressively to counter Major's sustained and punchy attack on
devolution as constitutionally ''dangerous''. But do Labour mean to keep
us waiting until the last minute for the detail, as per taxation policy?
This may not play well south of the Border, particularly when Mr Tam
Dalyell really gets going, in England, this week.
Not that the latest opinion polls harm Mr Blair on this issue and
others. On the contrary, we have the Sunday Times/Harris poll indicating
that 49% of voters support the transfer of some powers from Westminster
to Scotland and Wales and English regional assemblies, with 32% opposed.
Furthermore, rail privatisation is unpopular (64% against and only 16%
for). And reform of Clause 4 does not engage 55% who said that it would
make no difference to their voting intentions. Majorities still incline
to trust Blair with the economy and European policy rather than Major.
The poll, taken last Thursday and Friday of 957 people, labels the
Tories as the party of disunity.
Perhaps it needs a catalyst -- like the return of the Whip to the nine
Tory dissidents -- to spring a revival for the Prime Minister. But it
may go deeper. Building societies report a fall in house prices,
providing even less chance for people to escape the profoundly
depressing ''negative equity'' trap. Even so, the Tories still cut away
at mortgage tax relief.
So Mr Blair can say sucks to the pendulum theory, for the time being.
Maybe the electorate, lacking both a spittoon and an umbrella stand,
have opted for Mr Major. And gravity will be defied.

LAST Sunday the Hospitality Inn's Grand Ballroom played Vegas as a
sparse audience lapped up acoustic pop. Yesterday, it bore more
resemblance to the club scene in Pulp Fiction, minus its stars John
Travolta and Uma Thurman. A relentless seven hours of Cajun music played
to a sold-out auditorium, the majority of whom packed the dance floor to
a selection of acts that included the homegrown (Boogalusa, Deaf
Heights, Humpff Family) and the imported, Montpellier's French
Alligators and New Orleans La Touche.
Deaf Heights Cajun Aces have probably done more to popularise the
genre in Scotland than anyone else, and while their basic formula has
remained the same throughout their 10-year career, their solid rhythms
and exuberance have not lessened. Patently, this is an act for whom
Cajun and zydeo music is a labour of love, but for all their proficiency
Deaf Heights seem to be enthusiasts rather than innovators, vibrant but
not visionary.
La Touche, by contrast, have the advantage of authenticity -- their
bilingual introductions and New Orleans' home-made Louisiana Saturday
Night seem infinitely more evocative than Deaf Heights' Walking to New
Orleans.
The rapid after-show sales of the American band's CD suggested a more
big hearted audience approval for what to an untrained ear sounded like
mediocre fare.
Where the Humphff Family fitted in was harder to ascertain, but fit in
they certainly do with three Celtic Connections shows.

CHERISH The Ladies were one of the big hits of 1994's Celtic
Connections when they supported De Dannan. This year they were back as
headline artists drawing a near-capacity audience. Six American-born
women based in New York but of good Irish stock, they bring the
atmosphere of an Irish-American pub session to a big stage, easily
conveying the enjoyment they get from playing and singing the music at
the heart of their roots.
In Cathie Ryan they have a singer of true quality. Her reading of My
Own Dear Native Land obviously struck a chord with the Irish in the
audience while the Civil War song, Spoon River, added a sincere touch of
backwoods Americana.
Perthshire's Andy M Stewart is, ironically, a rarer visitor to
Glasgow. His set with guitarist Gerry O'Beirne was always entertaining
and musically out of the top drawer and hit a real golden period towards
the end with the hilarious, tongue-tripping Errant Apprentice, the
beautifully judged My Heart It Belongs To She and the stirring account
of that battle that never was, Haughs of Cromdale.
Earlier, another duo, uillean piper Liam O'Flynn and guitarist Arty
McGlynn, had given a display that bordered on the sublime, with McGlynn
sometimes playing the tunes in unison with O'Flynn, at other times
shadowing his pipes or tin whistle with a selection of hugely inventive
chord sequences, but always completely apposite. Small wonder that the
great piper Seamus Ennis, who thought guitarists beneath contempt, said
of McGlynn's playing, ''That's great piping''.

Clare Henry is exhilarated by the work of shooting-star Callum Innes
whose colour-saturated images appear to burst out of their canvases.
CALLUM INNES is a prime example of how impossible it is to categorise
contemporary Scottish painting -- other than by its success.
Edinburgh-born, Aberdeen-trained, now teaching part-time at Glasgow
School of Art, he has exhibitions in Paris, Frankfurt, London, Zurich,
Dusseldorf, Florence -- and the top accolade, Venice, may be on the
horizon.
Never one to compromise, he nevertheless makes a living from his art,
his pictures gracing the homes of Lady Helen Windsor, Stephen Fry, and
the editor of Vogue. Yet this 32-year-old shooting star is not a
figurative artist. His large, open, flat, elegant paintings are
minimally and geometrically abstract: white on white; grey on grey
squares and rectangles. Yet, as he is quick to point out, ''If you look
carefully, they are still about painting.''
The paint can be luscious and thick, or thin and ethereal. It can
shimmer like shot silk or orange shantung or drift mistily. Though
obviously a methodical craftsman and perfectionist, Innes's edges are
often slightly blurred as they are created by hand; never by ruler or
masking tape. ''The paintings may appear hard-edged and geometric but
they are all slightly squint; off the square. I like the sooty smears at
the edge too -- that's important.''
But almost more important than the paint is the bare canvas: a strip
alongside a grey rectangle; the border under a violet square. Sometimes
exactly half the painting is mere cream canvas. Or is it? Scrutinise the
edge of the canvas. Here is the telltale stain, a tide mark from paint
which originally covered the entire canvas but has been stripped back,
removed, washed off using turpentine to dissolve pinstripe-lines,
dribbles, rivulets or whole swaths.
''That's the exciting part. I'm exposing; removing. These are
paintings which operate from the edge. I paint the lot; then lift off.
It makes the canvas active. The slightly stained canvas echoes the main
body of colour, giving an added tension.''
''We have lift off!'' is an exhilarating phrase -- but not one usually
associated with oil paintings. However, at their best, like the bright
vermilion ones, these images actually appear to burst out of their
canvas. Conversely they can close down the space too.
Indeed Innes had quite a job hanging this show in Glasgow School of
Art's magnificent Mackintosh Gallery. ''I thought the intense black
paintings would look good but they didn't work here at all -- just
looked like deep holes. Surprisingly the soft grey paintings worked
best. Some are about landscape, but it's not landscape painting. It's
about walking in the hills or along Scotland's east coast where the
light filters through in an incredible way.''
Innes began as a figurative painter, but once into minimal abstraction
he limited his palette to very cool tones of grey, olive, white or
cream. Colour is a new departure, brought about by a move to a new
brighter, airier, top-lit studio -- and perhaps the happiness of the
arrival of his first child. ''I like the way colour can motivate; make
you feel happy or sad.''
The Mackintosh Gallery currently looks better than it has for ages:
uncluttered, cleancut and elegant, the perfect setting for Innes's
refined, contemplative paintings which challenge one's spatial
perception.
I also love the new colour-saturated pictures, such as Exposed
Painting Cadmium Red Pale 1994 or Cadmium Orange, because they exchange
cool, calm objectivity for lush sensuality. With their rich luminosity
but incredible simplicity they tap into an exciting spiritual dimension
of visual harmony.

The live touring version of the best-selling album A Woman's Heart II
wends its way to Edinburgh's Festival Theatre tonight, featuring Mary
Black, Frances Black, Sharon Shannon, and Mary Coughlan. David Belcher
meets two women with a lot of heart.
AS she opens her heart to me, no-nonsense songbird Frances Black
offers the assurance that she is doing it not to draw attention to
herself in a shock-horror-showbiz-star-tells-all fashion but instead to
offer encouragement to others who might be suffering as she once did.
''I'm an alcoholic who has given up drink and will hopefully continue
to,'' she says bluntly. ''I want folk to look at me and know that it is
possible to pull yourself up; to know that there is life after drink,
and that if you stop drinking, it's not as though your best friend's
died.
''I first spoke about it back home in Ireland on television on the Gay
Byrne Late, Late Show and got a great reaction. You see, I was a bit of
a wild young one. I went mad, going dancing, having a few jars and
enjoying myself, and then I had children very young and got married very
young . . . and it put me back in my place.
''Then I got a separation from my husband. And then it wasn't as
though I was reaching out for a vodka first thing in the morning, but I
was clattering the pints at night.''
Counselling pulled her out of it. Oh -- and music, of course.
As a member of Ireland's premier traditional-music dynasty, the Black
Family, Frances has at last taken her place up there alongside her
esteemed singing sister, Mary.
Both of them featured on the Irish Dara label's highly successful A
Woman's Heart compilation LP, still in the Irish charts two years on.
Both feature on its current follow-up, A Woman's Heart II -- and both
will be appearing live tonight in Edinburgh, along with Mary Coughlan
and Sharon Shannon, on the UK tour that is promoting both compilations.
As a schoolgirl with term-time commitments, Frances enjoyed success on
record in the States alongside her older siblings in the Black Family.
Then she had a successful spell in Arcady, whose big and frequent US
tours she forswore in order to stay at home with her children. So it
wasn't until two months ago that she made it Stateside to perform in
person.
''Imagine it. My first solo tour and I couldn't believe I'm playing to
all these Americans in Pasadena and Boston, and two shows at the Bottom
Line in New York, and one show is all Irish expats, but the other one is
all New Yorkers.''
Frances's next LP, due in March, contains four hitherto-unrecorded
songs written by another American, Nanci Griffith. ''I'd met her a
couple of times and screwed up all my courage to leave a message on her
answering-machine: 'Any chance of a few songs?'
''She courier'd 11 over to me! Nanci Griffith is a lovely woman --
very supportive of other women trying to get on in the business. Doing
the Woman's Heart tour has been brilliant, too, because everyone on it
is very supportive. No bitching. A lot of card-playing and singing after
the shows. And as it's the first time we've toured together since the
Black Family years ago, I get the chance to swap clothes with Mary.''
Accordionist Sharon Shannon's funky headgear and punky black leather
motor-cycle jacket might not gell so readily with the stage-apparel of
her fellow tour members. But despite her rock'n'roll status as a
one-time female Waterboy -- and despite a well-publicised thumbs up from
indie-music guru John Peel -- Sharon's traditional credentials are
equally deep-rooted.
''During my 18 months with the Waterboys, Mike Scott got me listening
to stuff I hadn't heard before. Van Morrison. Bob Dylan. Bob Marley.''
County Clare is maybe more remote than I'd thought. As if to make up
for lost time, Sharon's last LP, Out The Gap, features five tracks
produced by reggae riddim-master Dennis Bovell. And Sharon has composed
the music for a forthcoming BBC film, Shannongate.
And apparently you can be seen starring in it, too -- so was the film
named after you?
The legendarily shy instrumentalist recoils in horror at the mere
suggestion. ''No! It's named after Shannon Airport! And you only get to
glimpse me in a bar, meeting some friends and then playing a bit.''
Make friends with Sharon, Frances, Mary, and Mary when they play a
good bit tonight.

TWO classics of 1920s cinema were resurrected on Friday night by the
six-piece Harmonie Band whose speciality is performing scores written by
its director, Paul Robinson, to accompany silent films as they play in
front of an audience.
First off was Nosferatu, the 1922 version of Dracula. Filmed at the
height of German expressionism, one might have expected this dark tale
to be more chilling than it was. The menacing music built up an
expectation of horror that the narrative rarely matched. Possibly
because we all know the story too well. And largely because the
combination of hammy acting and archaically worded, badly translated
title cards had the unfortunate, unintended, effect of provoking
sniggers from the cine-literate 1990s audience.
The music, however, was guilty of deliberately encouraging giggles: at
times it commented ironically on the image; elsewhere it directly
contradicted the visuals, and throughout the film it anticipated far
scarier atrocities than we ever saw.
The marriage of the Harmonie Band's music and Buster Keaton's
delightful 1924 Sherlock Junior was, on the other hand, made in heaven.
A landmark in terms of stunts and special effects, it is also extremely
funny and poignant; and the Robinson score reflected this beautifully.
More hummable and of-the-period than the Nosferatu music, it contained
an evocative recurring romantic theme -- lush piano chords and
melancholy clarinet.
The packed Tramway audience loved it; and although one sensed that the
wild, genuine appreciation at the end was more for the film than the
band, that is where the music succeeded -- in bringing to life a
60-year-old masterpiece. The movie was the star, but the Harmonie Band
was the best support imaginable.

How a retired banker is challenging the might of a multinational oil
company in his own genteel -- yet devastatingly effective -- way.
YOU could hardly call him an eco-warrior. He is a courteous, refined
gentleman, Bunny Gray. The very epitome of the doff-your-hat generation.
Proffering his home-baked brandied fruitcake, he keeps a polite eye on
the content of his guest's coffee cup and another on the view of
gun-metal seas through the picture window of his lounge.
''Those tankers, my dear, are carrying cargoes with the equivalent
explosive power of two A-bombs. It is we who will be the front-line
casualties of these vindictive oil companies.'' You look around the
room, perhaps expecting some wild ecofreak to explode from the subtly
pistachio-washed walls, and realise this really is the genteel retired
banker talking. Bunny Gray may speak softly but he talks tough. As
Shell, to their chagrin, have discovered.
It comes of the experience of long years campaigning. And a long
memory.
He is a formidable opponent of Shell's plans to expand the
Mossmorran/Braefoot Bay petrochemical complex, close to his seafront
home at Aberdour.
The multinational can, and does, roll out reams of risk-assessment
analyses, churn out labyrinthine reports with maps of hazard contours
and fault trees, fork out small fortunes for consultants to give
dazzling explanations of how an accident is likely to occur only once in
a few generations. And Bunny will be there again, quietly, politely,
persistently, picking holes in their arguments. Finding the needle in
the statistical haystacks.
It is 17 years since he retired from international banking, in the
Bahamas and Switzerland, to come home to Fife. Since then he has joined
forces with some equally unlikely village warriors to oppose the oil
giants who run the natural gas liquids plant and its associated tanker
terminal at Braefoot Bay.
''It should not be there, should never have been given permission.
Certainly in the US, probably in no other place outside the Third World,
such an installation would not be allowed within four kilometres of a
population. Yet here we are a mile away, living with the risks.'' This
is the fourth expansion of the facility since it was given the go-ahead,
after a long battle, in 1982. Residents fear it won't be the last. They
are convinced there are ulterior motives in the #100m extension,
involving a fourth process module at Mossmorran and an extra jetty at
Braefoot Bay.
They fear it may be part of a longer-term plan for a gas
interconnector linking Fife with Europe. They do not, cannot it seems,
take the oil companies at their word.
''Shell has engendered mistrust in this community. We have been, how
shall I put it, stitched up.'' It is not the vocabulary one might expect
from such a pillar of the professional middle-classes.
But then Aberdour offers some surprises to those who go by
appearances. It is, to look at, a soft grey place. The sort of village
where community councillors might concentrate dissipating energies on
loud daytrippers disturbing their peace and dog turds filthying the
footpaths. It exudes gentility. A snoozing sort of place.
The kind of retirement refuge, you imagine, where villagers suck
peppermints while consulting their FT indexes and tallying share prices.
Where Mrs Thatcher's fading portrait might not be out of place on the
polished sideboard.
If, though, you were to view the formidable opponents of the oil
companies as mere Nimbies you would be underestimating the depth of
their loathing for what the petrochemical development has meant for the
coastal communities.
Not In My Backyard, Bunny says, is not the question. Not at any price
anywhere unless it is safe, is the point of the protest.
If planning approval for the expansion is granted there will be about
800 temporary construction jobs. There will be no permanent jobs to
balance the social and environmental cost of living within sight and
smell of the complex.
Shell says it needs to expand to capture new business to process
natural gas liquids from North Sea fields. It has stated: ''Should we be
unsuccessful in gaining this potential business then the viability of
the Fife NGL plant and the Fife ethylene plant becomes unclear in the
longer term.'' Shell will point to the benefits the plant has brought to
the community, to the #30m it is estimated to plough into a region
ravaged by the loss of mining and shipbuilding.
The community council will point to the promised jobs that never
materialised. Bunny says: ''This plant was supposed to bring in hundreds
of jobs for local people. There are, what, about 200 people working
there.
''It is not a question of having to pay the price of living close to a
major hazard. The benefits simply do not meet the costs.'' The Forth,
they point out, is one of the most industrial estuaries in the country,
with large numbers of tankers carrying hazardous cargoes plying its
length. ''We are not just looking after our backyards. We want to keep
the level of hazard down. It's not a case of moving the jetties or the
tankers somewhere else. It doesn't matter where else they go -- there
will be people there.
''We want to make sure it is safe.'' And there is the rub. Despite all
the assurances of safety given in the past, the level of suspicion about
the safety of the plant and its loading facilities was heightened by the
Havkong incident.
In January 1993, a tanker carrying explosive liquid gas broke its
moorings in gusting winds while loading butane at Shell's jetty. It
narrowly missed a tanker loading at an adjacent Exxon jetty and drifted
out of control to fetch up within 300 yards of cliffs at Hawcraig Point.
Shell was criticised in a joint report, after an investigation, by the
Health and Safety Executive and Maritime Safety Division of the
Department of Trade and Industry. They have tightened up moorings
procedures and now a tug is always on standby.
That is not enough to reassure the locals who were confronted by the
scenario they were told was unlikely ever to happen. ''What it showed
was that procedures were never as safe as we were constantly assured
they were. It took the Havkong incident to prove that our safety fears
were not just scaremongering.'' The recent disclosure of high levels of
benzene, a cancer-causing pollutant which is implicated in leukemia,
found during monitoring of tanker loading, simply offered confirmation
that the campaign to keep the oil companies alert to safety dangers and
health hazards must continue.
The planning application, now with Fife Regional Council, emphasises
that the risks of more tanker loading will not increase the safety
hazards for the coastal communities.
That flies in the face of common sense, Bunny argues: ''If there are
more tankers in the Forth, there must be a greater risk, surely.'' So,
armed with questions gleaned from a searching analysis of the three-inch
thick planning application, undaunted by the prospect of tussling with
the experts wheeled out by Shell, Bunny is ready to do battle once more
with the oil giants.
In some ways, the oil company can never win. Memories in Aberdour are
long. Villagers will recall how after the five-year campaign to halt the
complex failed in the early eighties, Shell insisted their legal bill
for a court case should be met by the campaigners.
The chairman of the campaign was threatened with prison if he failed
to pay. He was quite prepared to go to jail. The villagers had a
whip-round to pay the fees.
And there are those, still, who remain soured by the experience of
dealing with a multinational who will blackball oil company employees
who want to join local clubs.
That is not the kind of gesture that is Bunny Gray's nature. He is a
courteous opponent who has learned scepticism along the way. ''We have
been treated as ignorant villagers who are expected to be grateful --
but for what?'' Bunny wonders.

Belgrade, Sunday
THE cardinal rule of the Balkans is ''expect the unexpected''. Only a
week ago, the situation in the former Yugoslavia could hardly have been
said to have looked optimistic -- but it did look less pessimistic.
The Bosnian ceasefire was, and still is, generally holding and moves
were being made to restart stalled peace talks. But then came the
Croatian bombshell. The announcement that UN peacekeepers in Croatia
must go could tip the region not just back into war but into the most
savage round yet seen.
The fear is that without the stabilising UN presence in the republic,
a new war between Serbs and Croats will drag in not just Serbia but all
the Bosnian factions as well.
Ever since President Franjo Tudjman told foreign ambassadors last
Tuesday that the 12,000-strong UN force must leave, the Americans,
Germans, and others have been imploring the Croats to reverse their
decision, but so far to no avail.
If they fail, the UN troops stationed mainly in the Serb-held areas of
the republic will end their mandate on March 31 and must quit within
three months. The UN mandate for Bosnia is different, but the war that
would certainly follow their withdrawal would become inseparable from
the struggle for Bosnia.
UN ''blue helmets'' began arriving in Croatia in 1992 following the
war in which the country lost almost one third of its territory to what
became the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Krajina Serb
long term aim was to unite into a Greater Serbia once the Bosnian Serbs
had won their war, too.
The Serbs were happy with the UN presence because it helped them
consolidate their gains. Tudjman says that the UN force must go
precisely because it has done just that.
In the past two weeks, the Bosnian Serbs also have been eager to see
the UN truce succeed because then they would have ''blue helmets''
guarding their frontline, or the borders of what they call the western
Serb states.
However, bickering over the terms to reopen roads into Sarajevo has
puzzled UN officials who fear that apparently irrational bargaining
tactics over the last few days could rob them of the truce they need to
secure the 70% of Bosnia they now hold.
Initially, UN officials dismissed Tudjman's moves, saying privately
that he always made such threats just before the UN mandate needed
renewing because he sought to prompt the organisation into somehow
speedily restoring Krijina to his control.
They were doubly surprised because not only did they think the move
foolhardy in the extreme but it comes just at the moment when economic
talks between Croatia and the Krijina Serbs have begun to reap results.
Now UN officials are scouring the political landscape for the reasons
for Tudjman's hardline stance. There are some 300,000 Croatian refugees
from Serb-held areas and their pressure for action is growing. Combined
with this, some military men believe that the Croatian army is now
strong enough to take on the Krijina Serbs.
Such illusions are sheer folly. The Krijina Serb army is small,
perhaps only 40,000-strong now, and Krijaina was ripped from the body of
Croatia only with the help of the Yugoslav army. However, the truth is
that the Krijina Serb army is now more or less just an adjunct of its
big brother next door, the Bosnian Serb army.
Croatian strategists must also bear in mind that although Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic has distanced himself from the Bosnian and
Krijina Serbs, it is highly unlikely that he will allow the latter to be
defeated in any post-UN Croatian onslaught.
So the Croatian move could easily backfire and reunite the now divided
Serbs. The might of the Yugoslav army, with its vast stores of military
hardware, plus the more than two years of battlefield experience of the
Bosnian Serbs and the knowledge of Krijina Serbs that if they lose they
will be driven from their homes forever is bound to forge an almost
invincible military force.
One only need look at the map to see that once the war begins the
Serbs will open up with long-range rockets from the east to Zagreb in
the centre and to Dubrovnik in the south, leaving the Croatian military
like the Dutch boy and the dyke.
In a bid to avert this, though, envoys will almost certainly be
despatched and secret meetings arranged as the Bosnian Serbs try to
tempt Tudjman as they have done in the past.
In 1939, Serbs and Croats struck a historic accord, an autonomous
Croatia within royal Yugoslavia was given large parts of Bosnia. Those
borders remain dear to the heart of Tudjman's who only ended his war
with the Muslims last year under intense pressure from the US. The
Bosnian Serbs may now try to strike a deal with the Croatian leader.
The essence of it will be: take half of Bosnia in compensation for
Krijina. The problem is that Tudjman wants it all -- and so do Serb and
Muslim leaders.
So the truce that currently reigns in most of Bosnia looks as though
it will, after all, be nothing more than a winter break before the
fiercest spring campaigning season of them all.
The visit on Friday by big power envoys to the Bosnian Serbs to sound
them out about the so-called Contact Group peace plan apparently yielded
little so there is no reason to believe that the tormented region does
not once more stand before the gates of war. Barring the unexpected, of
course.

PLANS by the Government to curb air pollution will affect Scottish
cities and may result in the closure of motorways and city centres at
high-risk times.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office confirmed yesterday that local
authorities would be consulted on the implementation of a strategy on
air quality management to be announced on Thursday by the Environment
Secretary, Mr John Gummer.
Mr Gummer is understood to have agreed to set official limits on four
pollutants in response to public concern about asthma and respiratory
conditions. The move is being seen in some quarters as a victory by the
Department of the Environment over the Department of Transport in a
long-running battle over roads policy.
Mr Gummer is expected to order local authorities to produce detailed
plans showing how they intend to meet pollution targets.
As a result of these measures, the M6 in Birmingham may become the
first motorway to be shut to exclude motorists from the areas that are
worst affected by a build-up of fumes in windless or sunny weather.
Some city centres may be closed to encourage drivers to switch to
buses, trains or bicycles. Other options include lower speed limits and
spot checks for dirty exhausts.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said yesterday that any
new Government measures were unlikely to knock Strathclyde off course in
its plans for a new tram system and other areas of public transport
expansion.
The Strathclyde spokesman added: ''We are carrying out monitoring in
Hope Street, but at the moment we are committed to an integrated
transport system which includes the tram option. Allied to that is a
park-and-ride system. We have no powers to ban cars from the city
centre.''
He said that the region was expanding its rail network, but claimed
that with local government reorganisation, no-one was sure what the new
passenger transport executive's boundaries would be.
Lothian region's transport committee chairman, Councillor David Begg,
said that his council would consider imposing road pricing in Edinburgh
city centre to finance a new metro system, if the Government refused to
provide extra finance to help cut pollution.
He declared: ''It is essential that central and local government work
together to tackle these problems.
''Our problem in central Edinburgh is that we have got the fastest
growth in car ownership in Western Europe. We have got to take really
stringent action. The worry we have got is that even if we produced the
best public system that money could buy, we cannot do that because of
Government financial constraints.''
Councillor Begg maintained that the council's strategy, Moving
Forward, which it published six months ago, made provision for more
park-and-ride sites on the perimeter of Edinburgh, as well as new bus
priority routes which would remove parked cars from roadsides.
''Politicians in local and central government are still running scared
of the road lobby and are frightened to take on motorists. My personal
view is that road-pricing should be introduced, but that revenue raised
should be channelled into public transport,'' he said.
''We are facing a nightmare scenario on current policy with car use
doubling every 20 years. Pollution levels continue to rise to
unacceptable levels, and traffic congestion is reaching intolerable
levels with cities almost grinding to a halt and economies suffering.
''If the Government comes up with targets it is up to them to make
sure that local authorities have the powers and finance to attempt to
meet them. Otherwise it will be tokenism,'' he added.

TWO cavers were swept to their deaths yesterday by flood water in
Northern Ireland.
A third was missing last night after seven others managed to reach the
surface and raise the alarm.
The accident happened at caves known as the Cradle Hole at Florence
Court, County Fermanagh, eight miles from Enniskillen.
A party of 10 belonging to a caving club with members on both sides of
the Irish border had entered the caves.
Police said two men were swept away and their bodies were recovered
soon afterwards.
The Irish caves rescue organisation joined the RUC mountain rescue
team and other cavers in the search for the missing man.
About 50 rescuers, including police divers, were helping the search.
Two RAF helicopters fitted with searchlights were also being used.
According to police, the party had been under ground just 20 minutes
when the two men were swept away. They were 100 metres below the surface
at the time.

PROFILE: David Michels has turned around the ailing fortunes of
Stakis.Colin McSeveny describes the man and his methods.
WHEN David Michels accepted the challenge of reviving the Stakis Group
three years ago, one of his first decisions was to order 2000
top-quality beds for its hotel chain. ''At the very least it meant that
most of our guests would get a decent night's sleep,'' he says with a
laugh. ''After all, when the lights are out only the beds matter.''
The lights were nearly out for Stakis itself by the time Michels
settled into the chief executive's chair of a company that had become a
Scottish institution by the 1960s.
However, the Glasgow-based group's welcome return to health was
underlined last week when Stakis reported a doubling of annual profits
to #20.2m.
Founded in 1942 by Reo Stakis, a Greek-Cypriot immigrant, the
family-dominated restaurant firm was credited with ''transforming'' the
eating-out habits of a generation of Scots. In fact ''introducing''
would probably be a better description of the company's initial impact
on a country too poor or Calvinistic to rate gourmet eating among its
main attractions.
The arrival on Scotland's main streets of the familiar three-candled
steakhouse sign coincided with the economic boom that began at the end
of the Macmillan era. The culinary delights of prawn cocktails,
crisply-done steaks, and Hirondelle wine were suddenly available to the
masses.
With no competition to speak of, profits came easily and Stakis
floated on the Stock Exchange more than 20 years ago as it began to
expand aggressively into hotels, casinos, and (incongruously enough) old
folks' nursing homes.
Excessive growth and the customary problems of a new generation taking
over a family firm built up by a dominant father-figure took their toll
by the early 1990s just as the last recession gripped the country.
Rocketing debts and the inability of the company to sell suddenly
redundant assets precipitated a crisis as pressure mounted on Andros
Stakis, who had taken over from his father as chief executive. Losses of
#45m were reported by early 1991 and debts rose to almost #200m.
Sir Lewis Robertson, a renowned company doctor long used to urgent
corporate surgery, was brought in as chairman to placate the 21 creditor
banks amd countless investors demanding a turnaround or, at the very
least, their pound of flesh.
Six months of ''head-hunting'', short-leets, and interviews ended in
December 1991 with the appointment as chief executive of Michels, a
25-year veteran of the hotel industry who had risen to become
vice-president of Hilton Worldwide.
''Sir Lewis and I are complete opposites and that is probably one of
the reasons the formula has worked,'' Michels, a 48-year-old Londoner,
says as he looks over the Clyde from the group's sixth-floor offices on
the Broomielaw.
Like the wealthy and paternalistic chairman of a top football club,
Sir Lewis took care of the board of directors and the City while
allowing Michels a free hand in picking his team and setting out the
corporate tactics. ''He simply told me that his main job was to sack me
if I misbehaved and, with that very much in mind, I got on with the
job,'' Michels said.
His first task was to tackle the desperately low morale among staff
who had become used to steady growth but were now faced with the strong
possibility of redundancy after the turmoil surrounding the ousting of
Andros Stakis.
The young Stakis had left with the undoubted, if publicly unexpressed,
blessing of Sir Lewis who was never one to let sentiment get in the way
of good old-fashioned business sense.
Bridging the generation gap in family-run businesses is notoriously
difficult, and Stakis could be used as a study case.
Though Reo, now in his eighties, is honorary president of the company
he founded, the family connection has effectively ended in any executive
sense. His 11% stake in the group is the only legacy.
Meanwhile Michels set about restoring the company's fortunes convinced
that time was his main enemy. ''If I couldn't convince the City and the
smaller shareholders in a very short time that the company still had a
viable future then I knew there was no chance of survival.''
Having decided that the future lay in hotels and casinos, he raised as
much cash as possible from the sale -- rather cheaply -- of the old
folks' homes, restaurants, pubs, and so on, to fund improvements to what
would become the core sectors.
Aside from the new beds, the 37 hotels were upgraded through the
installation of Sky television in every room and the establishment of
corporate meeting rooms. ''These were priority measures that allowed us
to show some progress with relatively little outlay, particularly as the
banks were understandably reluctant to release any more funds,''
explains Michels.
Within two years about #20m was spent on hotel refurbishments as the
new management's growing reputation persuaded investors to part with
their cash.
The other positive points that convinced him Stakis could be turned
around were the quality of the line managers and the the underlying
loyalty of the customers. Only two leading executive posts were filled
by outsiders, leaving the remaining managers to fulfil their potential
under the new regime.
''We also found that the customer base was still very strong, which
indicated that while much of the company appeared to have lost its
profit motive its dedication to service was still intact.''
A mainly marketing career with some of the biggest names in the
leisure industry -- GrandMet, Ladbrokes, and latterly Hilton -- equipped
Michels with the operating skills for his new job while the consummate
boardroom pedigree of Sir Lewis completed his education.
A marketing drive to expand the 800,000-strong membership of the
group's 22 casinos and the installation of a computer system to keep
track of the hotel guests have paid off with higher gambling spend and
room occupancy rates among the highest in the UK.
In market valuation terms, the company has now recovered from a low of
#63m to #426m.
Ironically, one of Michels' few pastimes is poker, a passion he cannot
indulge in his own establishments because of the strict rules of the
Gaming Act. Tennis is another, but his stocky frame and 30-a-day
cigarette habit would indicate he should probably stick to card-playing.
The intrinsic worth of the Stakis hotel chain, where location is
all-important, and the more efficient running of the casinos have led to
a 180-degree turn in fortunes and an apparently secure future for one of
Scotland's best known companies.
''I know that when I was appointed, people said the first thing I'd do
was take control down to London,'' Michels acknowledges. ''Nothing could
be further from the truth as there is simply no sense in such a move
either financially or sentimentally.''
Successful businessmen are not best known for sentiment and the Stakis
chief executive, a newcomer to Scotland who still commutes weekly from
his London home, explains that if Stakis had been a standard English
provincial hotel group it probably would not have survived.
''There is definitely a feeling here that the Scottish public,
including the 20,000 small investors, really wanted the company to get
back to where it belonged and without their faith I don't think I would
be talking to you just now,'' he said.
The fact that his wife and two children are still in London should not
be taken as any lack of commitment. ''Given the amount I travel I
probably see as much of them there as I would if they lived in
Sauchiehall Street.''
As if to underline the Caledonian commitment, Stakis must be one of
the few companies to feature Flower of Scotland among the Muzak used to
entertain telephone callers while they await connection.

THAT daytime military street patrols have been suspended is a sign of
how the peace is being held, and extended, in Northern Ireland. That
development helps make it harder to put the clock back again to
violence, but immense problems remain before it can be considered
banished, at least for the IRA itself. There may be a minority of
extreme Republicans who will want to perpetuate an armed struggle, but
the hope is that they could be marginalised. Even getting rid of the
weapons -- and explosives -- which exist in considerable amounts in
Ulster, the Republic and, almost certainly, in caches here -- will be
hard. Another meeting between British civil servants and Sinn Fein will
take place today on this very subject. The Government hoped that the IRA
would surrender or destroy its weaponry early in the negotiations as a
gesture of good faith. And it is hard to counter the argument that
nothing would convince opponents of their conversion to democratic
politics than such a commitment. Unfortunately, there is still an
element in the IRA opposed to peace on anything but their own terms.
That may be part of the group to be marginalised in the future, but
there is no disguising its existence now.
The notion that the present IRA leadership should make a gesture on
the retention of weapons, advanced by some Unionist opinion, is still
attractive but even if made it could be more or less cosmetic, involving
some but not all of the arsenals. It will be a sign that peace is indeed
progressing if some sort of gesture emerges today but movement is still
slow. The same lack of pace is evident on the other side of the Ulster
divide, with the Unionists being particularly worried by the way in
which the Government appears to be willing to contemplate creating new
cross-border bodies with executive roles. These would make sense in some
respects, tourism is a good example, where it is possible to identify a
common interest, but the Unionists are anxious to have none of them lest
they represent the thin end of wedge destined to be moved further.
Mr Major cannot treat their doubts lightly, and not just because their
outright opposition would hideously complicate everything on the spot;
but because it would affect the very existence of his Government either
at once, depending on how the Tory rebels were to behave, or in the
relatively near future, given a by-election or two and the inevitable
Tory losses which would appear. The Unionists have an unusual power, and
they will seek to use it. It is not a challenge Mr Major could accept.
In a General Election two or more years ahead, the Tories can hope still
to escape overwhelming defeat or even to win if public opinion moves
with more evident economic prosperity. In any earlier election the only
question is whether a Tory defeat would rival 1906 or 1945, the best
years for the left this century.

What a brilliant move on European time by Viscount Mountgarret, which
as a Scot I heartily applaud (January 12).
The advantages of the move for all the UK are manifest and
overwhelming, and for the first time you have published an article by
William Russell that grudgingly appears to recognise this.
The only argument against seems to be that on December 21 it will be
dark in Aberdeen at 9am.
The Herald has always campaigned against this move, which I have never
been able to understand, unless it's perhaps in the interest of the
newspaper industry to have lighter mornings when distributing their
newspapers.

It is sad that so many fine and entertaining ''works of art'' languish
either in store or are otherwise hidden from view.
Reading of George Wyllie's discovery of the Rickey sculptures lying
out in a yard (December 31), we were glad that Sustrans had been able,
with his co-operation and that of Inverclyde district, to find a home
for his 1979 Clydebuilt Easel overlooking the rump of the Lower Clyde
shipyards and port of Greenock instead of a dusty storeroom.
There may yet be an opportunity to site a further garden festival
remnant or two on what we hope to make the largest and most public art
gallery in the UK if not Europe.
Although Sustrans' goal is to create a comprehensive network of routes
for walking and cycling, such routes are nothing without their
''features'' from historic landmarks, through giant, volunteer-created
murals to commissioned works by the leading names in environmental art.
Unfortunately the Rickey works do not apparently lend themselves to
climbing over, and require a particular care in siting. I hope a
suitable place can be found. Who knows, Glasgow may even come close to
Paris in sculpture per hectare -- La Defense in particular -- if we get
our corporate and individual fingers out.
And the talent is there. In last year's Glasgow School of Art degree
show I discovered several works which were robust and fun for path-side
features, but many of the young artists, faced with nowhere to store and
no benefactor to pay for installation, had to consign work to a fate
worse than the council parks depot.
With over 50km of off-road cycle routes in Strathclyde alone, we've
got the spaces, and over a dozen examples to look at already. Clare
Henry, get your bike out!

ABOUT 100 demonstrators were at the farmhouse home of Agriculture
Minister William Waldegrave yesterday in a noisy but non-violent protest
over the Criminal Justice Bill and the foreign veal trade.
But the Bristol MP -- who was not at home -- spiked their guns by
giving instructions that the would-be trespassers could stage a peaceful
protest on his Somerset farm.
Although there was a strong police presence there were no arrests and
more than two hours of demonstrations passed without damage to property.
Mr Waldegrave has been the target of anonymous threats and letters
containing razor blades, allegedly sent by animal rights activists angry
at the export of live calves.
Yesterday protesters climbed on to the walls close to the main
farmhouse at at Chewton Mendip, near Wells.
Earlier the protest had focused on the house of the manager of another
nearby farm, owned by the family, which has a dairy herd.
Mr Waldegrave became a particular target after it was disclosed that
some of the calves from his family's farm had found their way to veal
crates in France.
The practice is banned in Britain.
The demonstration was organised by Criminal Justice Bill Solidarity
and was joined by hunt saboteurs, anarchists, and anti-roads protesters.
Dr Margaret Jones, spokeswoman for CJBS, said it was also aimed at
highlighting the ''cruelty'' of the veal trade.
The anti-export row continued this weekend with demonstrations at
ports and airports. Five people were arrested outside Plymouth docks.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the travelling doctors

the British Rail staff who excelled themselves in ensuring I was taken
to hospital as quickly as possible.
First-class care and attention was then given to me at Law Hospital

Prejudice, of which I am accused by Mr Stuart Gulliver towards the
organisation which he serves as chief executive, is bias or preconceived
opinion (November 30).
Prejudice I deny; my opinion of the Glasgow Development Agency has
been formed entirely by observation and by talking to a wide range of
people in Glasgow who are privately critical of its activities but feel
publicly constrained in the face of the financial power wielded by the
agency -- an issue which Mr Gulliver chose not to address.
Some of this dissatisfaction has been expressed on this page in recent
weeks.
The Clyde Maritime Trust's proposal for the garden festival site is
not my ''pet project''. It is just that I, along with many others, feel
that this strategic site needs something better than the mediocre car
and business park promoted by the GDA.
Indeed, as your editorial (October 4) argued, this is ''an
unimaginative use of a splendid site . . . If the agency is unable to
make a more positive impact on the environment it's a poor look-out for
Glasgow.''
That so important an organisation as the GDA should be widely
perceived, rightly or wrongly, as failing this city must be a cause for
concern, especially now that Glasgow must live up to its hard-won title
of City of Architecture and Design in 1999.
Mr Gulliver evidently attaches great importance to meetings. I am
happy to meet him, but it seems to me that it would be much more useful
to do so in a wider forum than an inner sanctum in tautologous Atrium
Court.
I suggest that what is needed is a public meeting at which
representatives of the chamber of commerce, the Glasgow Institute of
Architects, amenity societies, and other interested groups can discuss
the strategy, policies, and accountability of the GDA and its role in
Glasgow's future.
I invite Mr Gulliver to convene such a meeting.

<HEADLINE>Warning for Labour's devolution devotees. It's a vote loser and threat to election win, says Dalyell</HEADLINE>

DEVOLUTION is a vote loser and threatens Labour's chances at the next
General Election, according to veteran MP Tam Dalyell. The warning in a
speech tonight marks his return to the heart of the constitutional
debate.
Addressing party activists in Leicestershire, Mr Dalyell will condemn
Labour's proposals to deliver a Scottish parliament and assemblies in
Wales and the English regions in its first year in government as
''fundamentally wrong and flawed''. His attack on one of Labour's core
policies will cause dismay among the party leadership.
Yesterday it appeared to cause dismay among activists in his
Linlithgow constituency. After a four-hour meeting with his local party,
he admitted his outspoken views could lead to his being deselected, and
said he would have ''no shred of criticism'' if it did so. ''In no
circumstances would I ever be an independent candidate.''
He was told not to rock Labour's devolutionary boat by activists
worried that his criticisms were providing ammunition for both
Nationalists and the Tories. No formal decision was taken but the local
party chairman, Mr Ian Grant, said that in ''a frank exchange of views''
the MP was asked to ''desist'' from any action that would prejudice the
implementation of Labour's home rule proposals.
However, his speech in the Tory constituency of Blaby, once held by
the former Chancellor, Lord Lawson, resurrects the West Lothian
question, which the campaigning MP used to effect against devolution in
the seventies. Tonight he will say the problem of Scottish MPs
legislating on English matters at Westminster when a Scottish parliament
will prevent English MPs doing the same for Scotland has still not been
resolved.
He will tell a meeting of the Enderby and District Labour party that
the West Lothian question remains unanswered, adding: ''It's all too
clear from the new year of 1995 that whether we like it or not the Prime
Minister and the government machine will go on, day in and day out, week
in and week out, banging out the tune that dominated the entire Prime
Minister's Questions last Thursday.''
On Thursday Mr Major and Labour leader Tony Blair clashed over
devolution. Tory back benchers took turns in attacking Labour for
proposals Mr Major claim threaten the future of the Union.
Scots MPs shorn of responsibiity for Scottish affairs by a Scottish
parliament yet continuing to vote on English questions would be
unacceptable to the electorate, Mr Dalyell will say.
''There is no way, once it is so publicly identified by a British
Prime Minister with his access to the ear of Britain, that the proposal
can do other than damage Labour's electoral chances.''
A Scottish parliament would mean Scotland's over-representation at
Westminster, whereby Scotland has more MPs per head of population than
England, will cease to be democratically credible.
Mr Dalyell will say: ''In this context it hardly helps that it takes
some 65,000 to elect an MP in England and 55,000 to elect an MP in
Scotland. Not only will such a situation democratically not be credible
come a Scottish parliament, it will be widely perceived not to be
credible.''
And in a conclusion that will anger many of his colleagues, Mr Dalyell
claims the party's policy, so recently reaffirmed by Mr Blair, will have
a devastating effect on Labour's electoral prospects.
''Seventy-two Scottish MPs, unaccountable in Scotland on all the most
delicate matters of domestic politics, being seen to have a decisive say
in English affairs, would be an enormous vote loser in the marginal
constituencies of England required to be won by an incoming Labour
government.''
Mr Dalyell denies claims that he is stirring up trouble for the party
at a time when it is seen to be on the defensive over proposals which,
as far as the English regions are concerned, remain undeveloped.
Mr Major has led his cabinet on an offensive against constitutional
reform since the new year, and Mr Dalyell argues it is the Prime
Minister who has brought the issue to the fore.
Yesterday he said: ''I have not spoken publicly on devolution since
March 1, 1979, the day of the referendum.''
He was invited to address the Blaby meeting at the party conference
last year, and proposed to talk on Lockerbie, higher education, or some
of the other issues on which he is working.
Mr Ralph Innes, the branch's political education officer, who invited
Mr Dalyell, yesterday confirmed that the subject of the MP's speech was
chosen by the branch. ''We wrote to him and asked that he address
himself to devolution and the West Lothian question.''
The issue is certain to annoy some back in his constituency, which Mr
Dalyell admits. After yesterday's meeting, he said: ''I was criticised
today for being patrician-like regardless of what the people in the CLP
were saying. I am quite contrite towards this because my behaviour was
defective.''
He added that ''there was very strong criticism about lack of
consultation and I accept that''.
However, when asked if he would not now be going to Leicester to give
his speech, Mr Dalyell said: ''A lot asked me not to go to Blaby. I told
them, and it was all very calm and there were no raised voices, that I
shall be going.''
He also remained adamant that he had no plans to alter his speech in
Blaby. ''I am not criticising Labour in raising very serious concerns
that someone will have to answer whether they like it or not. These
problems won't go away,'' he said.
Meanwhile, SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday sought to exploit
weaknesses of both Labour and the Conservatives over the constitutional
issue. He claimed the Tories were in trouble in Scotland, while Labour
had ''plunged in over their heads in England''.
Mr Salmond, addressing his Banff and Buchan constituency association,
said: ''Major's offensive and inflammatory language highlights his
inability to explain to Scots why our politics should be dictated by MPs
who know nothing and care less about our country.
''After only a week of debate, Labour's English proposals have been
shown to be a shambles, an insult to the intelligence of the electorate
south of the Border.
''The Labour scheme offers Scotland less than it needs, and England a
recipe for confusion. After 20 years' preparation, Labour still has no
answer to the West Lothian question.''
Mr Salmond said the solution was independence for both Scotland and
England, with democracy and parity north and south of the Border, and
both countries prospering as neighbours in Europe.

THE DIRECTOR of InterCity West Coast has no intention of putting money
into an upgrading of the ageing Glasgow-London line to cut travelling
time by an hour unless guaranteed a return on the investment.
Mr Ivor Warburton is instead prepared to live with a much cheaper
modernisation of the infrastructure which would merely retain current
five-hour journey times -- the key barrier to increasing passenger
numbers and revenue.
He dismissed talk of high-speed services as ''a lot of hot air'' until
the hard financial realities of an upgrading rather than renewal of
equipment were worked out.
The dilemma for InterCity West Coast, expected to bid for the train
operating franchise later this year, is caused by the fragmentation of
the railways in the run-up to privatisation.
Ownership and responsibility for the upkeep of the line -- electrified
in the mid-1960s and now plagued by operational difficulties -- has been
transferred to Railtrack.
InterCity West Coast already pays more than #160m a year in access
charges to run trains on the cross-border route which is said to be on
the verge of ''catastrophic failures'' unless investment is available
soon.
In an exclusive interview, Mr Warburton said InterCity West Coast
would not provide its share of additional costs for a Railtrack
upgrading to cut travelling times unless assured it would pay for
itself.
He admitted anything less than an upgrading of infrastructure would
mean that InterCity West Coast would still be unable to compete
seriously with its primary rival for business from Scotland, air
traffic.
A failure to upgrade would be even more damaging to the train
operator's current bid to woo more custom from the heavily populated
North-west of England, notably Manchester, by way of slashing travel
times to London.
Mr Warburton has to choose between meeting Railtrack's access charges
for a modernised line with no reduction in travel times -- or contribute
towards the extra costs of an upgrading, which in turn would increase
the access charges because of improved performance.
A consortium studying the line's future on behalf of Railtrack lodged
its findings with the Department of Transport last month.
At least #600m worth of much-needed modernisation is required, with
funding to come from the private as well as public sector.
But key options in the study are said to include 160mph tilting and
double-decker trains in a #1600m upgrading that would achieve four-hour
links between Glasgow and London.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney is expected to announce later this
month what level of expenditure on the line will be sanctioned by the
Government.
Mr Warburton said: ''I have still to see what costs of an upgrading
rather than renewal will be. Until I see the figures, and work out the
figures, I cannot say if an upgrading was affordable. I certainly cannot
support upgrading if it did not pay for itself.''
Mr Roger Salmon, director of rail franchising, has acknowledged that
privatisation of the west coast line is unique because of the need for
''a comprehensive modernisation''.
Invitations to tender for the train operator's franchise are expected
later this year -- and Mr Salmon, seeking bidders who include proposals
to help fund a modernisation programme, is willing to consider ''a
longer franchise'' than normal to attract investment.
It is rumoured the length of franchise could stretch to as much as 20
years to allow investors a return in outlay on new infrastructure.
The lifespan of eight other train operating franchises available this
year -- including ScotRail's -- will be seven years.
Mr Warburton's threat to run trains at current speeds rather than put
money into a speedier service may be politicking because InterCity West
Coast faces severe budget cuts. The Government wants a 10% cut in its
operating costs from April under a drive to reduce subsidy levels to the
railways.
Income to cover InterCity West Coast's #390m overall costs consists of
#260m in fares revenue, #40m from other train operators for maintenance
work -- and, making up the losses, a #90m Government subsidy.

<HEADLINE>Lang faces anger over #4.4m HCI 'sweetener'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980336826</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office yesterday confirmed that it was considering
awarding a grant of up to #4.4m to the new owners of the Health Care
International private hospital in Clydebank.
The admission provoked fresh attacks on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
who has already suffered severe criticism over the many millions of
pounds of public money given to the original venture before it went into
receivership.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, yesterday demanded
a statement from Mr Lang and accused him of offering a ''sweetener'' to
save his own face. SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Lang should resign.
The #180m hospital had been open only a few months when it went into
receivership in November, having failed to attract sufficient overseas
patients. Public funding for the venture included #22m of Regional
Selective Assistance, of which #17.6m was actually paid to the hospital.
The latest row has been caused by a leaked letter, apparently written
by a senior civil servant, indicating that the Scottish Office is set to
pay the #4.4m balance to the new owners, and that the #17.6m already
paid will have to be written off.
Preferred bidders are a consortium led by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Company, which was an investor in the original project. Earlier this
month, the receivers announced that the group had signed an agreement in
principle to buy the hospital.
It is not known how much the consortium will pay, but it is likely to
be substantially less than the original #180m cost.
The HCI project was supposed to create up to 1800 direct, and a
further 2000 indirect, jobs, but the hospital currently employs 350.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday: ''The receiver has already
announced that he is in negotiation with another party to take over the
hospital. The Secretary of State has made it clear that he wishes these
negotiations well, and that the Government would prefer to see this
hospital continue according to the original plan, attracting patients
from abroad.
''The question of whether the unpaid amount of RSA would still be
available to the new owners is under discussion. But there is no reason
in principle why it should not be, if they continue to run the hospital
and provide the number of jobs originally planned.''
Asked about the suggestion that the Regional Selective Assistance
already paid out would have to be written off, he replied: ''There is no
serious prospect of recovering it.''
The Shadow Scottish Secretary yesterday accused Mr Lang of
''breathtaking nerve''. He said: ''After the fiasco with #30m lost
forever on this flawed project, the people of Scotland will be astounded
that even more of their money is to be poured into this financial black
hole.''
Accusing the Government of having taken leave of its political and
business senses, Mr Robertson added: ''Having their fingers badly burned
in the HCI collapse, they seem willing to drive their whole arm into the
fire. To commit further scarce resources into this hospital is a slap in
the face to the cash-strapped NHS.
''Ian Lang must make an immediate statement explaining his outrageous
decision to give this #4.4m sweetener to save his own political face.''
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said Mr Lang
could no longer be believed.
Mr McAllion said that Mr Lang had told the media recently that no more
money would be handed out to the hospital. He had also claimed that the
HCI debacle had cost the taxpayer less than #15m, yet the leaked letter
stated that #17.6m would have to be written off.
''If a chairman or chief executive of a private company had misled
shareholders to the extent that Mr Lang has misled taxpayers on this
issue, their heads would roll. So too should Mr Lang's,'' Mr McAllion
added.
Mr Salmond also called for Mr Lang's resignation, saying he had been
economical with the truth and profligate with Scotland's finances.
''While the Scottish health service is crying out for resources, the
Tories are throwing money at HCI in order to promote private health
care. This is political dogma in the extreme and it is costing Scotland
dear.''
The allegedly leaked letter, published in the Sunday Mail yesterday,
was apparently written last month by an official in the Scottish Office
Industry Department to the chairman of the Scottish Industrial
Development Advisory Board.

January 10.
I am disappointed but not at all surprised by the predictable response
of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland to my letter (December
9) concerning the site for the National Gallery of Scottish Art.
To suggest that putting forward the idea that the gallery should be a
new building in the city centre is representational of some
''fundamentalist creed'' is, quite frankly, absurd.
Whatever the merits or otherwise of the existing Post Office building,
it is not the Musee D'Orsay and a modern art gallery is a specific and
highly technical building type.
Moreover, Glasgow is not so architecturally precious that the centre
cannot be touched or considered for improvement.
As a Glaswegian I find it very sad that the heart of my city has no
contemporary public building of international or even national standing;
despite producing innovative, highly regarded, and conscientious
architects from two great schools of architecture.
Cities grow, move, and change over time and the greatest European
examples contain, in my view, environmental markers which are
representational of the age and culture that produced them.
Yet our best buildings were built 100 years ago by architects long
dead or are office blocks or a business school. I wonder what message
that will convey of our society to our successors in the new millennium?
Perhaps the Heritage Society is content always to look forward to the
past or is happy to pass on only our forefathers' legacy, but I
certainly am not.
While it is very important to promote serious debate on this issue, a
new building on the Post Office site does not presuppose that it will be
incongruous in its setting or without context or delight and I would be
happy to provide examples of contemporary architecture in other major
cities where similar challenges have been fully met and successfully
resolved.
Until now there has not been a project which would merit considering a
redesign of such an important part of our city fabric. The National
Gallery of Scottish Art should be a proposal of great cultural
importance that it would warrant such a proposition, and maybe the city
grid can be broken in this single location; to reinforce the potential
significance of this building to Glasgow and Scotland.
Finally, 200 years of change around George Square may well have shaped
a significant architectural complex around it. However, it is still very
difficult to cross from any of the surrounding buildings to the square.
To do so inevitably means having to negotiate heavy traffic and no
existing building can use the square for egress or as an element which
can be sensitively included as part of a greater design.
This, to my mind, limits the potential of the square. If the Heritage
lobby think otherwise, then they must also believe four legs are good
and two legs are bad.

THE sister of former Beirut hostage Tom Sutherland has died in
hospital after contracting the flesh-eating disease, necrotising
fasciitis.
Miss Elizabeth Sutherland, 71, died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on
Saturday afternoon after all her main organs failed ''due to the toxic
effects of necrotising fasciitis''.
Her death follows that last week of a 10-year-old boy, who died from
the disease in Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children three days
after an operation to remove affected tissue from his leg.
Miss Sutherland had been referred to hospital last Sunday by her
doctor after another brother, Peter, found her ill at home near Falkirk
with a throat infection.
She was operated on that night at Falkirk Royal Infirmary and later
transferred to the Glasgow hospital. An area of skin extending from her
lower jaw to her chest was removed in surgery, but her condition failed
to improve.
She was the second case of necrotising fasciitis at Falkirk Royal in
the past four months. A young mother contracted it after giving birth by
caesarian section.
Mr Tom Sutherland, a retired academic now living in Denver, Colorado,
had been told about his sister's illness and was standing by to fly to
Scotland.
Miss Sutherland was among the family members who celebrated with Mr
Sutherland, a former Rangers player, when he returned to Scotland two
years ago after being released from six years in captivity in Beirut
with Terry Waite, Brian Keenan, and John McCarthy.

The key fabricated by the Parkhurst escapees is comparable in its mode
of operation to the wooden keys developed by the ancient Egyptians.
Would secure confinement of dangerous prisoners not be facilitated by
the adoption of electronic locks in which operating codes could be
readily changed as safe practice demanded?
Furthermore, the electronic locks could be rendered inoperative at the
press of a switch, e.g. at times when surveillance is below optimum:
possibly at certain times of day or from disturbance of some type.

January 10.
George Hume's article on training for winter mountaineering was
interesting as far as it went, but he failed to mention a crucial point
(January 7).
Formal training gives you a foundation but more times than not it is
subsequent practice and the experience you have gathered from that
practice that will get you out of a crisis in the mountains.
Carrying map and compass, ice axe and crampons, and knowing how to use
them is essential for the Scottish hills in winter, and these skills can
all be ''taught''.
But it is only practice that will give competence, while other
essential skills will be acquired only through experience --
understanding different weather and snow/ice conditions; knowing your
limitations and not being afraid to say no; knowing that turning back
(not getting out of the car even) isn't an admission of defeat;
remembering the time to relax is in the pub and remembering that
individual responsibility is paramount, it is your life, your risk.
With respect to who trains the instructors, legislation is totally
unnecessary as many fully qualified independent instructors already
exist.
Anyone who is a British Mountain Guide (BMG) or has a Mountain
Instructor's Certificate (MIC) issued by the Mountain Leader Training
Board (MLTB) or is a member of the Association of Mountain Instructors
(AMI) is suitable. These people run courses throughout Scotland.
Whether training comes from formal instruction or from careful and
painstaking self-teaching, it is not and never will be a cure-all for
mountain accidents.
In the final analysis Scotland's hills will never be safe but the
risks can be reduced by gaining as much knowledge as possible from as
many sources as possible, regularly putting it into practice, and
learning from experiences.

<HEADLINE>Opposition claims ScotRail is dropping down queue for privatisation. Labour pledges public-owned railways.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>STUART TROTTER,POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
LABOUR'S deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, yesterday pledged that the
party would bring the railways back into public ownership if
privatisation went ahead.
Party spokesmen are increasingly confident, however, that the
Government will not succeed in selling off most of the nearly 100
separate BR units before the next General Election.
The Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, warned that if the
Government attempted to dispose of the largest unit, Railtrack, shortly
before an election, buyers should not expect to make ''windfall
profits'' from compensation.
The Opposition understands that ScotRail is dropping down the queue
for early privatisation. It is unlikely to be in the first four
companies for which the franchise director will, later this month, set
minimum standards of service required of future operators.
Labour's Transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said: ''We believe the
cash squeeze on the railways is having, possibly, a worse impact on
ScotRail than on any of the other 25 operating companies.''
Labour believes the privatisation process is getting into a muddle,
but promises that detailed policy will evolve in response to the
Government's success or failure in meeting its own targets.
Interviewed in Edinburgh, where he was attending a membership drive
campaign meeting, Mr Prescott said: ''This is a complex problem and we
are looking at a number of options. When the work is done we will report
back directly to Tony Blair.''
Mr Prescott is chairing a sub-committee of the Shadow Cabinet to work
out Labour's strategy for dealing with rail privatisation. Other members
are Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown and the Shadow Transport Secretary,
Mr Michael Meacher.
The Transport Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, said Labour policy on the
railways was now ''a shambles''. Earlier, he said, Labour spokesmen,
including Mr Blair, had refused to commit themselves to
renationalisation.
Dr Mawhinney said the Government planned to improve the railways by
introducing private finance, private sector management skills, and more
sensitivity to customer demands.
''Labour is going to turn the clock back to the old system which has
been steadily declining over 40 years,'' he said.
There is speculation within the Labour Party that the leadership has
strengthened its commitment to public control of the railways in a bid
to gain support among left-wing unions and local parties for Mr Blair's
plan to replace Clause Four with a more up-to-date version.
First reactions suggested the tactic had not been successful.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of the train drivers' union, Aslef,
said he still opposed replacing Clause Four and hoped Mr Prescott's
statement meant renationalisation.
''Public control of the railways would still be privatisation,'' he
said.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the large GMB union, told BBC
TV's On The Record that he supported all privatised industries being put
under stricter public control through regulation.
But he added: ''Most people agree we could not afford to
re-nationalise all these industries. It would cost around #70,000m.''
0 Mr Prescott stressed that Labour's first priority was to try to stop
the privatisation going ahead, as it had with plans for the Post Office.
Mr Wilson said that potential buyers should remember that most of the
services offered for sale depended on taxpayer subsidy to put their
books in the black. They should not assume that a Labour government
would be willing to subsidise private profit making.
The Opposition is calling on Tory MPs to back it in the vote at the
end of a Commons debate on Wednesday, in which it will call for
''through ticketing'' levels to be maintained, rather than for a full
range of ticket sales to be limited to specified ''core'' stations.
Mr McLeish said that in Scotland around 200 outlets would be reduced
to 38.
* The Director of InterCity West Coast Mr Ivor Warburton has predicted
further cuts in sleeper services if ScotRail fails to get its economics
right.
He stopped just short of agreeing with union claims that the transfer
from InterCity West Coast to ScotRail is a poisoned chalice.
But he warned ScotRail would have financial problems if Government
subsidies for sleepers are even lower than expected after privatisation.

THREE men were in police custody last night in connection with two
separate road accidents in which two young men died in Coatbridge and
Glasgow.
Mr Tony Wedlock, 19, of Kellock Avenue, Coatbridge, was walking home
with two friends about 2.25am yesterday when the accident happened in
Old Monklands Road.
One of his friends, Mr Stewart McGivern, 19, of Ellismuir Street,
Coatbridge, suffered minor injuries and shock. Another unnamed companion
escaped unhurt.
Police called an ambulance but Mr Wedlock was already dead.
Last night a police spokeswoman said that a 22-year-old man was in
custody in connection with the incident. The man is expected to appear
at Airdrie Sheriff Court today.
The second accident happened just before midnight on Saturday near the
Leaders garage in Springburn Road, Glasgow.
Police officers attempted to resuscitate Edward McKee, 16, of
Carbisdale Road, Springburn. He was taken to hospital but was dead on
arrival.
A police spokeswoman said last night that two 17-year-old men were in
custody in connection with the incident. They are expected to appear at
Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
Meanwhile, a report is being sent to the procurator-fiscal at Ayr in
connection with the deaths of Mrs Margaret Lynn, 50, and her son James,
18, who died in separate road accidents in the town on Friday night.
Mr Lynn was knocked down by a car as he tried to cross the northbound
carriageway of the A77 Glasgow-Stranraer road near his home.
His friends then ran to his mother's house at Thornyflat Street to
tell her about the accident. She was struck by another car as she
attempted to cross the southbound carriageway to reach her son.
Mr Lynn was dead on arrival at Ayr Hospital. His mother died shortly
after being admitted.

A GROUP of Scottish Labour MPs, whose constituents were seriously
affected by the recent flooding in Strathclyde, will press the
Government in a late night Commons debate tonight on what measures can
be taken to prevent a similar disaster occurring.
The floods caused extensive damage in the Kirkintilloch, Paisley,
Renfrew, and Irvine areas. Strathclyde region faces a flood bill of
almost #10m for repairs to houses, roads, and sewage systems.
Paisley MPs Irene Adams and Gordon McMaster are expected to join Mr
Sam Galbraith, MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, Mr Brian Donohoe, MP
for Cunninghame South, and Mr Tommy Graham, MP for Renfrew West and
Inverclyde, in lobbying the Government.

Blaby
BLABY is fertile ground for sowing the seeds of anti-devolution. This
bedrock Conservative constituency is just the sort of place John Major
has in mind when he dreams of stirring up English nationalism against
Labour's plans for reforming the constitution.
Tonight, in the village of Huncote, Labour MP Tam Dalyell will
interrupt a silence of 15 years and 10 months to ask again the question
which helped to kill of devolution in 1979.
In doing so he will raise the banner of resistance for those within
the party who, deep-down, cannot accept the constitutional change Labour
leader Tony Blair has committed his party to delivering in its first
year in government.
The man who asked Mr Dalyell to come to Leicestershire and talk about
constitutional reform doesn't believe in devolution either. Mr Ralph
Innes, the local Labour Party's political education officer, is a
typical activist. He knows his socialism and Labour history inside-out.
Mr Innes met Mr Dalyell on the promenade at Blackpool last year. He
invited the MP to address the Enderby and District Labour party, one of
the constituency's branches, and insisted on the topic.
The offer to speak on Iraq or Lockerbie or science was refused. In its
letter, the branch told the MP it wanted to hear about devolution and
the West Lothian question.
It is not, Mr Innes admits, a subject that preoccupies Blaby.
''I've done a lot of canvassing and people simply don't know about it,
nor care. But regionalisation and the centralisation of power in London
is an issue among activists, and the Prime Minister has made the
constitution topical.''
Mr Innes, like many Labour traditionalists steeped in the
anti-nationalism of socialism, is sceptical about devolution.
''I'm a great lover of Scotland, but I think more unites us than
divides us.''
The retired specialist in textile technology, a German Jew who fled
Berlin in 1939, is unusual for the constituency in that he has any
opinions on the subject at all. If devolution has become a permanent
feature of political debate, Labour's vague offer of regional assemblies
of England has so far gone unnoticed.
''Neither devolution nor regionalism strike a chord around here. There
is a lot of feeling in favour of Leicestershire, but by and large people
are terribly wedded to these ancient counties,'' Mr Innes says.
Blaby, one of the safest Tory seats in the country, takes up a large
area of the semi-rural lands south of Leicester. It is an untypically
prosperous white-collar area, conservative to the core.
The town that gives the constituency its name is an unattractive
succession of recent brick shopping precincts built around an
intersection. Mr Nigel Lawson, when he was MP for the area, lived
elsewhere.
Constitutional reform is not a subject that dominates conversations
here. Even the traditional Labour passion-stirrers of jobs, health, and
education fail to evoke a response.
Mr Wilf Smith, owner of the Blaby Bargain Centre, says this is because
prosperity and low unemployment have produced contentment.
''Devolution seems a funny issue for Labour to choose. People are
unlikely to have any strong felings about it, and are not likely to mind
if Scotland is given a say over its own affairs. And if Mr Major expects
me to rise up and defend the Union, he's wrong,'' he said.
Tonight will be a measure of whether or not Mr Major's outburst
against change at the New Year has provoked interest in the way power is
distributed in Britain.
Mr Innes fears that only a handful of branch members deep in this part
of England will come to hear the prophet of Linlithgow.

THE Reverend Donald MacLeod (above right), minister of Sherbrooke-St
Gilbert's Church in Glasgow, yesterday presented a cheque for #5000 to
Mr Jim McPherson, superintendent of the Church of Scotland Lodging House
Mission in East Campbell Street, Glasgow.
Sherbrooke-St Gilbert's, in Nithsdale Road, Pollokshields, had
launched an appeal for the homeless in the city last year as part of its
centenary celebrations. Then in July, the church building was very badly
damaged by fire, which destroyed the roof and reduced the fabric of the
ornate sandstone building to a charred shell. The church itself is now
homeless, and during the lengthy period of reconstruction work will have
to hold its services in the hall.
The grand total of its appeal for the homeless, inspired no doubt by
kindred spirit, and described by Mr MacLeod as ''commendable'', was
announced at yesterday's service.

THE bones of two different dinosaurs have been uncovered in Scotland.
It has long been suspected that such prehistoric creatures once
inhabited the country, but until now the only evidence scientists had
was one footprint.
The two bones, found on Skye, are being held in museums in Glasgow and
Edinburgh and will be on public view for the first time tomorrow.
At least one of the two discoveries might never have been seen by
scientists or the public: an unknown collector who found one of the
bones broke off the middle piece without reporting it.
Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaentology at Glasgow University's
Hunterian Museum where the huge shinbone is on loan, said: ''I'm
disappointed to see this sort of vandalism by irresponsible collectors.
''Such uncontrolled collecting has already destroyed too much of our
heritage. If it had not been for the responsible and concerned
collectors who reported the bones, neither scientists nor the general
public would ever see them.''
The fragments at the Hunterian will be returned to Staffin Museum on
Skye for permanent display in April after they have been studied and
casts taken.
The bone, around three feet long with a circumference of about 25
inches, is from a sauropod dinosaur, possibly Cetiosaurus, one of the
four-legged, long-necked and long-tailed creatures similar to the more
famous Diplodocus.
It comes from 170 million-year-old rocks, of the Middle Jurassic
period, near Valtos on Skye, which could soon be designated a Site of
Special Scientific Interest by Scottish Natural Heritage.
A party of BP Exploration geologists unexpectedly found one end of the
bone last year. Ms Jan Wolfe, of the Oystercatcher Restaurant at
Staffin, found the other fragment when she was walking along the beach
and stubbed her toe on it. She donated it to the local museum.
The earlier bone find was in 1992 in Early Jurassic rocks,
approximately 210 million years old, at Strath in the south of the
island.
The shinbone is from a small carnivorous dinosaur, about 3-4ft long,
and closely related to Dilophosaurus, another ''star'' of the Spielberg
film, Jurassic Park.
The finder, a Mr Metz, took it home to clean up and only realised what
it was much later. He donated the bone to the National Museums of
Scotland on condition it would later be housed in Skye.
It is now on temporary display in the Royal Museum of Scotland in
Edinburgh.
Dr Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the National
Museums of Scotland, said: ''Our bone may be small but it's a pointer to
bigger things to come.''

A POST-mortem examination is due to be held later today on a young
Scot who died while playing in an amateur football match in England.
Kent Constabulary said last night that Kirk Anderson, 23, appeared to
have suffered a seizure after making a tackle during the game in
Maidstone on Saturday. It is thought that another player may have fallen
on top of him.
His brother, William, 27, a qualified nurse who was also playing in
the match, tried to revive him.
Mr Anderson, a musical instrument technician in Maidstone, was taken
by ambulance to the town's general hospital, but was found to be dead.
A police spokesman said exact details of the accident were not
available, but added: ''From what we know, there was nothing untoward;
it was just a normal tackle. He seemed to have had a fit or some form of
seizure.''
His parents, William and Isobel Anderson, of Honeybank Crescent,
Carluke, travelled to Kent on Saturday night to join William, who lives
in Canterbury.
The couple are members of the Scottish Congregational Church in
Carluke. The Rev William Downie told parishioners of the accident before
yesterday's service.
Mr Downie said later: ''It appears that Kirk went into a tackle with
an opponent who came down on top of him. William went over when he did
not move, and felt for a pulse, but there was none. Kirk was a fine
young man and a very keen footballer.''
The police said details of the post-mortem examination would be sent
to the coroner.

SCOTLAND'S restaurant and hotel owners are letting the country's
cooking down by failing to let natural talent breathe, the country's top
chefs were told last night.
At the first annual dinner of the fast-growing Scottish Chefs
Association, organiser Brian Hannan urged owners and local enterprise
companies to invest in better quality Scottish cooking.
Addressing more than a hundred association members, Mr Hannan attacked
restaurant owners who held their chefs back because they saw running a
restaurant merely as a business, and had invested in something they did
not necessarily understand.
''They do not nourish the confidence of their chefs; they do not
develop their chefs' skills. They have only invested in indifference,''
he said. ''Good cooking is inspirational. All good chefs know the value
of producing food of which they are proud. But many chefs don't get the
opportunity to develop their skills. They are held back by owners who
know nothing about food.
''To fully develop the potential for Scotland to become a cooking
nation, we need more people in hotels, restaurants, and in positions of
public authority to understand about the value of good food and about
the better business of good food.''
Mr Hannan said the association -- which includes top chefs such as
Nick Nairn of Braeval Old Mill in Aberfoyle, Hilary Brown of La
Potiniere in Gullane, and Betty Allen of Airds Hotel near Appin among
its members -- will be contacting local enterprise companies and hotel
and restaurant owners in a bid to persuade them to invest in better
cooking.
Over the next year, the association will run 24 different training
courses throughout the country, including a series of three-day
workshops for young chefs at the Dalkeith kitchens of Masterchef winner
Gerry Goldwyre.
Haute cuisine for the masters palate
At last night's dinner at the Glasgow Hilton hotel the chefs were
inspired to greater things with a meal of:
Parsnip and chilli soup with parmesan croutons and chives
Scallops samosa with hot things
Guinea fowl with cabbage, potato,
and smoked bacon sockle with a thyme veloute
Mousse brulee.

VINNY Pazienza outpunched former four-times world champion Roberto
Duran throughout their 12-round IBC super-middleweight title fight in
Atlantic City on Saturday night to earn a unanimous points decision.
Title-holder Pazienza, 32, was simply too young and fast for the
43-year-old Panamanian who looked a ghost of the fighter who proved
himself one of the best lightweights of all time.
The three judges scored the fight 116-112, 117-111 and 118-110 to
Pazienza, who consistently landed combinations to the body and powerful
left-right hooks to Duran's head.
Duran landed some technically-perfect counterpunches at times but they
clearly contained little power. There were no knockdowns in the fight,
and neither boxer appeared to be suffering.
Duran, who has been fighting professionally since 1967, said: ''I will
not retire after this. I will stick around and fight again.
''I could not move as quickly as I wanted,'' he added. ''I know I was
a little slow and I'd like to fight Pazienza again.''
On the same bill, Hector ''Macho'' Camacho won the vacant IBC
welterweight title after the referee stopped his contest with Todd
Foster after 1min 45sec of the fifth round. It was Camacho's forty-ninth
win in 52 fights.

* THE appearance of super-middleweight Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn is
enough to ensure that Musselburgh's Brunton Hall will once again be
packed this evening, and an added attraction for east of Scotland fight
fans is that Quinn's younger brother Tom will be making his professional
debut on the bill.
Willie has lost only once as a professional and that was on points to
Newcastle's Mark Jay in his first fight, but he avenged that by stopping
Jay on a cut-eye decision after only 82 seconds in November.
It seems only right that the pair meet for a third time. The
Englishman says: ''Okay, I lost at Irvine, but it was inconclusive and I
must have another go at Willie.'' Tommy Gilmour, who manages and
promotes Quinn, has obliged.
The 22-year-old from Tranent has gone on a 13-fight winning run since
his only loss and he said: ''That debut defeat still hurts, because I
believe I won the fight. The cut-eye win doesn't really count. I want to
put the record straight properly and that means beating him on points or
knocking him out.''
Jay is a tough fighter, but, with arguably the most fervent and noisy
fans in the country behind him, Quinn must be a strong favourite.
Tommy Quinn, a 19-year-old welterweight, takes his first step as a
professional against Birmingham's Billy McDougall. The test should not
be beyond him, but there is the added strain of making his debut.
Another two brothers on the bill are Hugh and Billy Collins, from
Stirling. Super-feather Hugh has lost only once in nine contests, and
that was caused by a cut, and he should be too good for John T Kelly, of
West Hartlepool, while light-middle Billy will be confident against
Seamus Casey, from Alfreton.
Keith Knox, the former ABA flyweight champion from Bonnyrigg, will
expect a repeat win over Neil Parry, of Middlesbrough and Glasgow
lightweight Tanver Ahmed has a good chance against Ludworth's Mickey
Hall.

PETE Sampras is in confident mood as he begins his defence of the
Australian Open tennis title in Melbourne against Italian Gianluca Pozzi
today.
The American has won two Grand Slam tournaments in each of the past
two years, firmly establishing himself as the world's top-ranked player
ahead of Andre Agassi and Boris Becker.
Sampras' 10 titles last year included wins in the Australian Open and
Wimbledon.
His biggest challenge is likely to come from in-form No.2 seed Andre
Agassi, who has not previously played in the Australian Open.
Agassi has warmed up for the event by playing an exhibition tournament
in Adelaide, but is refusing to set himself targets over the next
fortnight as he prepares for his first round encounter with South
African Grant Stafford.
''Pete's not my concern,'' he said. ''My first-round match is. You
cannot afford to take anything for granted.''
Becker faces the toughest first round assignment of the big names -- a
meeting with American Patrick McEnroe, who won the New South Wales Open
last weekend.
American Jim Courier is seeded ninth after a 16-month title drought,
but he won the Australian Hardcourt title in Adelaide two weeks ago and
opens against David Rikl of the Czech Republic.
Other top names include twice Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia, Dutchman Richard Krajicek, 1994 runner-up Todd Martin of the
US, Australian Pat Rafter and Grand Slam Cup winner Magnus Larsson, of
Sweden.
Michael Chang has displayed the best form in the past week, beating
Pat Cash, Becker, and Sampras in the Colonial Classic exhibition which
is played on the same surface as the Open. He has played in the event
only twice before and faces Australian wild card Paul Kilderry.
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario can take over as the world's top-ranked woman
if she wins in Melbourne. Four-times champion Steffi Graf is absent and
her likely rivals for the title are Gabriela Sabatini, France's Mary
Pierce and the Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez.
Sabatini won the season-ending Virginia Slims Championship in New York
and then defeated top-seed Lindsay Davenport to win the New South Wales
Open final yesterday to give her a big boost for Melbourne.
Sanchez Vicario, winner of the US and French Opens last year, says she
is not feeling pressured by the prospect of taking over from Graf as No
1.
''If I make it, that's great. If not, I'll keep on working,'' said the
Spaniard, who opens against China's Fang Li tomorrow.
Second seed Martinez faces German Barbara Rittner in her first-round
match, while No 3 seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic plays Canadian
Patricia Hy-Boulais and Pierce will play Tina Krizan of Slovenia.

Newcastle 1 Manchester United 1
NEWCASTLE striker Paul Kitson proved there is life after Andy Cole by
netting the equaliser which left Alex Ferguson's Manchester United five
points behind Premiership leaders Blackburn.
Mark Hughes looked to have earned his side three points with a
typically-fearless finish which left him hospital-bound after being
clattered by Newcastle keeper Pavel Srnicek.
Hughes -- the centre of intense transfer speculation -- lay flat out
on the St James' Park turf for three minutes before being stretchered
off with his legs bound together and then ferried by ambulance to
hospital.
The injury was first diagnosed as a deep gash on the knee, which
required a dozen stitches -- but further examination showed that Hughes
had injured the ligaments in his right knee.
Ferguson was clearly worried about the extent of the injury to the man
who had seemed favourite at Old Trafford to make way for #7m signing
Cole.
''The doctors have said Sparky should be kept in hospital overnight,''
he said. ''We know it's ligament damage as well as the gashed knee, but
I just hope it isn't the cruciate ligament.''
If the cruciate ligaments have been damaged, the injury could mean 12
months out of the game or -- at very worst -- the end of Hughes' career.
Newcastle took control in the second half before Kitson picked the
perfect moment to hit his first goal in two months.
And, although Eric Cantona was twice inches away from grabbing victory
in the final moments, Newcastle deservedly shared the spoils.
The champions went in front after 13 minutes.Dennis Irwin played the
ball in to Cantona on the Newcastle left and the Frenchman's touch took
Darren Peacock out of the game and sent in Hughes, who rammed home his
eighth of the season as Srnicek raced from his line.The Czech keeper
crashed into Hughes, catching him on the knee. The Welshman was carried
off and Paul Scholes came on.
In first-half injury time, Robert Lee hit the bar with a shot from
outside the box. After the break, Newcastle immediately took the
initiative with Lee and Venison both shooting at Schmeichel. For all
their domination, the St James' Park faithful looked set to be denied
until the sixty-eighth minute.
Fox played the ball towards Kitson, with Gary Pallister in attendance,
but, when the ball dropped, it was the striker who reacted quickest,
turning past him before firing through Schmeichel's legs.
* SWINDON player-manager Steve McMahon last night dismissed
speculation linking top scorer Jan Aage Fjortoft with Newcastle, after
seeing his team beat first division leaders Middlesbrough at the County
Ground.
Norwegian international Fjortoft scored his twenty-third goal of the
season in the 2-1 win, but McMahon insisted: ''We have had no contact
from any club about Jan. If anyone comes in he will be the first to
know.''

MARTIN Scott yesterday faced up to having made the type of history he
will not want to remember -- being the first man to receive a red card
in British rugby.
The former Dunfermline hooker was sent off on his debut for Orrell in
the English first division clash at Leicester. And he's already started
a minimum 30-day suspension, which means he's out of Scotland A's match
against France in Glasgow on Friday.
The red-card scheme was introduced down south only a few weeks ago,
and Scott said: ''I suppose I'll have to live with that tag for the rest
of my career, but I'm determined to put it behind me and prove that I'm
a good player, not a dirty one.''
Back home in Fife, Scott added: ''It came as a complete shock when the
ref said I had to go. He said I had deliberately stuck my knee into an
opponent, but that's nonsense. My knee made contact, but I was trying to
roll him over to get at the ball.
Scott, who won his only full cap in Australia three years ago, went
on: ''Missing the A game against France is a real sickener. After being
kept on the sidelines by Kevin McKenzie, I was looking forward to
reminding the selectors what I could do.''
Meanwhile, Bath butcher David Hilton will win his first full Scotland
rugby cap against Canada at Murrayfield on Saturday, writes Brian Meek.
He takes the front-row place of prop Alan Sharp, who injured his back
playing for Bristol against Sale on Saturday.
Hilton, 24, 5ft 10ins and 16st 7lbs, and who holds down a regular spot
in the English champions' first team, already this season has tasted
victory for Scotland A against South Africa and Italy.
The Scots have also lost the services of Doddie Weir from the
replacements' bench. He damaged both knee and ankle as Melrose slumped
to defeat against Boroughmuir.Shade Munro, the GHK lock, will cover.
These alterations now mean more changes for the A team's Friday match
at Hughenden. John Manson of Dundee High School FP takes over from
Hilton and Heriot's lock Andy Macdonald is in for Munro. The three new
replacements are Grant Wilson of Bourghmuir, Gala's Ian Corcoran and
Robb Scott of London Scottish.
Gord McKinnon, the back row forward who was controversially suspended
by his union after disciplinary problems on his country's tour to
France, flew in with the Canadian rugby squad which arrived in Edinburgh
on Saturday.
McKinnon's inclusion strengthens the Canadian back row which has lost
Al Charron, who was injured while playing for the Barbarians against
South Africa.

THE Scottish League hearing which threw out Gary Bollan's contract
appeal last Thursday was a nonsense and should have found in favour of
the Dundee United player.
It is believed members of last week's Scottish League Appeals
Committee have subsequently admitted to colleagues that the majority of
the panel found in favour of Bollan, but in true footballing fashion
they closed ranks to protect the establishment.
The Scotland under-21 internationalist had gone to Scottish League
headquarters to have the four-year option, part of an eight-year
contract with the Tannadice club, declared invalid -- but the appeals
committee ruled his long-term deal must stand, and he will now appeal to
the SFA.
The committee comprised: Yule Craig (St Mirren), Donnie McIntyre (Ayr
United), Campbell Ogilvie (Rangers), Ian Donald (Aberdeen), Bob Fleeting
(Kilmarnock), and Douglas Cromb (Hibs).
The committee's feeling was that, if they had declared Bollan's
contract invalid, the League would have been implicated, having accepted
and registered the contract.
Bollan is being assisted in his quest by the Scottish Professional
Footballers' Association and their secretary Tony Higgins, who has been
campaigning against long-term contracts for young players. If the appeal
to the SFA fails, Bollan will take his case to the civil courts just as
another United player, Billy McKinlay, plans to do.
Bollan's case pointed out that the first four-year part of the
agreement was clear and concise on detail, but that the four-year
roll-on option wasn't, and having been at Tannadice now for more than
four years he is tied to United by the contract option.
Other Tannadice colleagues, including Tottenham Hotspur target David
Hannah, and former Scotland midfield player Jim McInally, are also ready
to follow the same route when the final outcome is eventually reached.
When he was a 17-year-old, Bollan was delighted to sign an eight-year
deal with his home-town club, and looked ahead optimistically to a
glittering career in Scottish football, but the glitter has turned to
dust. He will be 22 in March and, as an adult trying to make his way in
life, his wage without first-team appearance money or win bonuses is
around #150 a week.
Only last year, FIFA ruled that players 18-years-old and under could
not sign long-term contracts, but the players' unions around Europe want
the age limit set at 21 and will continue to campaign towards that end.
The world body's decision to outlaw the practice -- United are thought
to be the only club in Scotland who used the system -- suggests they
accept the immorality of tempting young and naive players to sign what,
in some cases, can become life sentences.
While United's camp continues to be hit by contract squabbles, the
team slipped deeper into relegation difficulties after Saturday's 2-0
defeat by Hearts.
It is now 10 years since United have won at Tynecastle and the latest
defeat means that they have lost in all four visits to Edinburgh this
season -- conceding 13 goals and scoring just one.

FIFE Flyers posted their first win in six ice-hockey games when they
beat premier division bottom-markers Bracknell Bees 7-4 at Kirkcaldy
last night.
The injury-hit Fifers held their discipline on their blue line thanks
to veteran Czech Milan Figala and former Paisley Pirate Doug Marsden.
The only blemish was a freak injury to talented young forward Richard
Dingwall. The youngster had to be helped off the ice after a wire cage
protecting his face on his helmet was dented and hit the bridge of his
nose.
In Edinburgh, Racers grabbed a point thanks to captain Tony Hand who
equalised nine minutes from time. Racers led 8-6 at the end of the
second period, but three goals from Humberside Hawks put them in
trouble.
Leaders Nottingham Panthers slipped to their first league defeat of
the season by 9-8 at Sheffield.
In the first division, second-placed Paisley Pirates lost 11-7 to
bottom markers Lee Valley in London. Results:
Saturday: Premier division -- Basingstoke 6, Whitley 5; Cardiff 7,
Durham 3; Edinburgh 9, Bracknell 4; Fife 6, Humberside 7; Milton Keynes
2, Sheffield 9; Nottingham 14, Peterborough 6. Division 1 -- Blackburn

STEPHEN Hendry hammered Dennis Taylor 9-1 last night to capture the
Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge snooker title in Birmingham.
The Scot won title No.51 of his 10-year pro career -- and his fourth
this season. His success has guaranteed a #100,000 donation for his
charity, the Downs Syndrome Association. Runner-up Taylor earned #40,000
for Motor Neurone Disease research.
The world champion said: ''I wasn't pushed hard to play to a high
standard, but a 9-1 victory is good no matter who you are playing.''
In beating fellow Scot Alan McManus 6-5 in the semi-finals on Saturday
night, he fired in breaks of 145 and 105 but could not repeat that level
of scoring against Taylor.
Hendry began with breaks of 54, 55, and 44 to lead 2-0 and Taylor
wasted two chances to snatch the third frame.
Taylor averted a whitewash by taking a scrappy seventh frame, but
Hendry led 7-1 at the end of the first session. He finished off
impressively with a 107 break in the tenth frame -- the twenty-seventh
century he has made so far this season -- to extend his match-winning
streak to 15.
His victory also is the eighth in the past six months by a Scot. All
four ranking events have been won by Scots, including the world
champion's three triumphs earlier this season. In addition, teenager
John Higgins won the Australian Open in late summer and then the Skoda
Grand Prix in Derby, Alan McManus picked up the Dubai Classic in
October, while Billy Snaddon lifted the King's Cup in Bangkok.
Ironically, the only two events to elude the tartan brigade were held
in Scotland. Ireland's Ken Doherty won the Regal Scottish Masters in
Motherwell last September and Welshman Mark Williams went off with the
Benson and Hedges Championship in Edinburgh. But even these wins had a
Scottish connection -- both Doherty and Williams are members of the
Stirling-based Team Sweatershop.
* ALEX Higgins yesterday qualified in Blackpool for the final stages
of the British Open. The Irishman, who plays former Buddhist monk Tai
Pichit in the world championship on Tuesday, scored his first win of
1995 by 5-4 over Darren Clarke after having trailed 2-0 and 3-2. Other
results:
A Hamilton (Eng) beat E Henderson (Sco) 5-2; C Small (Sco) beat N
Gilbert (Eng) 5-1; T Murphy (N Ire) beat C Thorburn (Can) 5-4.

A NEW magazine in the USA is generating all kinds of interest, not
least because of its unusual title.
Many people at first thought that Heave was a publication for
enthusiasts of shot-putting, others that it might have some connection
with that dubious American pastime of tossing the cow-pat. The more
turgid felt that it must have something to do with getting sick.
The truth, though, is that Heave is the magazine of the International
Hurling Society -- and that has nothing to do with the Irish national
sport. It's simply a group of individuals devoted to the activity of
throwing things.
The current issue contains stories on the origins of the mounted
crossbow and the use of armadillos for trap-shooting, among others. And
while cow-pat tossing is overlooked, there is a fine piece devoted to
tossing the cow itself.
''Due to a cow's asymmetrical shape,'' Heave proffers, ''special
considerations during hurling are necessary to avoid a cow spinning off
range.''
Surprisingly, founders John Quincy and Richard Clifford, both from
Texas, devote their non-hurling hours to dentistry and engineering. Two
years ago they were drawn to the sport of hurling after having seen a
cow-slinging siege catapult in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
They promptly began work on a siege catapult (properly called a
trebuchet) of their own. ''The problem was, we couldn't find any plans
for trebuchets,'' explains Clifford. ''They stopped making them around
1350.''
Undaunted, the two enthusiasts recruited a team of engineers from the
University of Texas and produced a device that can throw a bowling ball
250 yards.
Next year they're planning on unveiling something called ''The Big
One,'' the world's largest hurling machine. It will be 100ft tall and
should be powerful enough to hurl a Buick motor car more than 200 yards.
''I've purchased 200 acres of land adjacent to my property,'' says
Quincy, ''just so the Buick will have somewhere to land.'' Then they may
make The Big One available for charity events where, for a fee, people
can hurl any item of their choice, like a piano.
''I figure The Big One will be able to throw a 180lb mine about a
third of a mile,'' calculates Quincy. ''Of course, we'd never actually
throw a mine. At least, not a live one.''
* EVERY sportsman knows the value of spectator support. A crowd of
fans can lift you to heights undreamed of, or consign you to a
competitive hell. When the Indianapolis Colts recently scored a 10-6
victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Colts' defensive tackle, Tony
Siragusa, gave full credit to the team's supporters. ''They were
definitely the twelfth man,'' he enthused after the game. ''If I could,
I would give everyone other than the ugly guys a kiss on the lips.''
Sleep is key to
Ryan's success
FOR an accomplished competitor in two sports, Ryan Minor appears to
have a distinct lack of energy. Although he is a star on the University
of Oklahoma's basketball team, he has also been drafted by the Baltimore
Orioles for a career in major league baseball.
Maybe the demands of two sports are just too great. In the
university's sports media guide, Minor's profile reveals that his
hobbies are sleeping and watching television.
Before a big game he likes to warm up by watching MTV. And during
half-time? Rumour has it that he sleeps, but with his head-phones on.
* THERE are unwritten rules in every sport. Sports Illustrated has
broken one of them by writing some of those unwritten rules down.
Like, for example, the one that says that the team coach always sits
in the front row on the team bus. And that if he's sick or dead, the
seat remains empty. Or how about another that dictates that, in the
clubhouse of a losing team, you must act as though there has been a
death in the family.
Eveybody knows, of course, that you should never stand behind the
pool-table pocket that your opponent is shooting for. And you should
never, ever put your finger in someone's else's bowling ball.
The most sacrosanct unwritten rule of all, though, may be the last.
After competition of any kind anywhere in the world, the winner always
buys.

NEWTONMORE'S defeat at the hands of Lovat, the third time the
Kiltarlity shinty side have won against them this season, means that the
Badenoch club now have an anxious few weeks ahead to see if they will
qualify for the national league next season.
The new set-up without Newtonmore is virtually unthinkable, but if
they lose to Fort William this Saturday in their last league match of
the season, they could be overtaken for the fourth spot by both Skye and
Lovat.
Newtonmore fell behind on Saturday to a Stevie Munro hat trick and
never recovered.
Holders Kingussie coasted to an 8-1 victory over Lochaber, with Ronald
Ross netting six times.
Oban are still on course for a ninth successive Bank of Scotland
Celtic Cup title after a 3-2 away win over Kyles. Oban were two up, both
scored by Dougie MacIntyre, in 11 minutes, but Kyles levelled with a
Neil Nicholson double. Oban's Stephen Jamieson clinched victory.

IT was at the wee open spot in Raeburn Place in which Edinburgh
Academicals placed themselves a century ago and more that I first
encountered women's rugby. A lovely set of playing fields with a
magnificent clubhouse. (How, one asks, have rugger clubs managed to
produce such grand grounds and canny clubhouses and perfect pavilions,
when footy can't manage much more than a crumbling terrace and a brick
wall to pee against?).
I remember the game very well. It was the first women's international
between Scotland and Ireland. That was a fair while back, nearly two
years ago. In women's rugby that is ancient history, for the game is
damn-near brand new for the girls but has come forward enormously in the
last couple of years. Certainly the last Women's World Cup brought new
interest, new fans and spectators, but most particularly, new players.
I spoke to Maureen Sharp, secretary of the Scottish Women's Rugby
Union, and with Ramsay Jones, the women's team manager, and they both
told me of the amazing development in rugby for women.
Ramsay, rather a big lad himself, is yet another man who inexplicably
finds himself coaching girls, because he got asked. They told me there
are more than 30 clubs in Scotland now, playing in three divisions.
Divisions one and two have six teams apiece and play several times a
year. Division three has 10 teams who play each other once, but there
are lots of other teams who play scratch games and guest and friendly
games and just play.
''What we are now getting happier about,'' said Ramsay, ''is that the
teams come from the Borders up to the far north.''
Maureen explained there was undeniable resistance to women playing
this most Corinthian of sports, for part of that ethic was involved with
practically killing yourselves.
''But we have had fantastic support from a lot of the men,'' Maureen
told me, ''even in areas we thought we wouldn't, such as the Borders.
Melrose, Duns, Langholm -- they hosted a Swedish team not so long ago
and billeted them in Langholm itself -- they were all just great.'' (Is
this not the town where they would have bayoneted Hugh McDiarmid, but
now they put up girl rugger players?)
The clubs themselves have increasing numbers of female members.
Edinburgh Accies have about 50 regular participants. No wonder they are
top of the First Division. Well, they are now. Until yesterday afternoon
they shared top place with rivals Heriot-Watt University Women. Neither
had been defeated so far.
But it has to be said that Heriot-Watt damn near won, and their side,
though a little less skilful, showed a robustness not normally
associated with ladies sport. I am not going to tell you who the lassie
was from H W who rucked horribly, then raked, and then looked up to see
where referee Brian McCathie was, and delivered two fair skelps.
As it turns out, Heriot-Watt lost 12-5, despite the fact that the
Yooni team possesses Paula Chalmers, sister of Scotland's men's
stand-off, Craig, and a number of stand-out players as well as stand
offs.
The Accies opened the scoring with a try from Ali Mackenzie after a
well-deserved penalty went wrong and Ali drove it over the line. H W
equalised with a heavily worked score by Kim Craigie, but the score of
the match was the winning one from tiny Sandra Williamson of the
Academicals, (she is, in fact, known to all as ''Gnomie'', but a nice
wee gnome she is at that), when she shimmied all of 25 yards past
everybody to put the ball between the posts, allowing team-mate Lee
Cockburn to convert with ease.
Truth to tell it was a lousy pitch for women's rugby. The same way
that quick and speedy soccer players don't enjoy the best of afternoons
in sticky glaur, neither do sports in which handling and speed on your
feet counts more than physical strength. Women, in any sport, tire
quickly when long-term physical effort is required: they shine at short
sports, or at least ones in which there can be an occasional respite.
The girls' legs yesterday began to tire and what makes female rugby
often entertaining -- the fleetness of foot, the quick, (if rather
eccentric), handling, the ability of shifting the ball quickly into
space -- and made the last World Cup such a revelation, didn't have the
conditions at Raeburn on Sunday.
In short the lassies tired a little, and it showed. Rather a
lacklustre game towards the end, it suffered from too much mud, and
perhaps too much inadequate kicking. Despite some obviously excellent
kickers -- Lisa O'Keefe, a 23-year-old stockbroker who is in fact an
ex-George Heriot's girl who has since joined Edinburgh Academicals,
leaving her dad swithering in support -- kicked exceptionally
accurately, and so did the two rival flankers (both Scottish
internationals), Anny Frietas and Jeni Sheerin. And no, I didn't spell
the names wrong. Covering women's sport is a nightmare when it comes to
names.
But it is a delight when it comes to watching such enjoyment. Nobody
was hurt. Except me. One of the girls told me her dad remembered me. Not
over the bar that was, but below the belt. Cut to the quick.

GRAEME Donaldson won the CIS Insurance Scottish junior bowls title at
Midlothian yesterday when he defeated Ian Sneddon 21-12.
But while Donaldson's game yesterday failed to reach the high standard
of Saturday's semi-final, when he beat Paul Conlan 21-12, he still
finished a convincing victor, giving his Elgin club their first national
title.
Robert McCulloch claimed the pairs title for the third time in four
years, this time teaming up with Brian Fulton. The Prestwick pair edged
out Ray Watson and George Sneddon 18-15 at the last-four stage, and then
produced a big finish yesterday to end the hopes of Walter McEwan and
George Cadzow with a 26-16 win.
The men from Lanarkshire led 14-12 after 15 ends but Prestwick picked
up a 5 on the sixteenth end, dropped a single on the next, but added a 7
for a 24-15 lead, and Lanarkshire surrendered two ends later.
Watson and Sneddon, from West Lothian, also were out of luck in the
triples. They joined up with Kenny Logan but lost out 10-22 to Alistair
McLelland, Ronnie Watters, and Derek Ross, who won 22-10.
West Lothian led 6-3 after seven ends but then the Ayrshire side had a
run of 2, 3, and 4 for a 12-6 lead after 10 ends, and they went on to a
convincing victory.
Blantyre's Brian McGregor and Davie Mungall earned consolation for

* LAURA Davies closed with a one-over-par 73 to finish joint sixth,
nine strokes behind winner Dawn Coe-Jones in the US LPGA Tournament of
Champions yesterday.
Coe-Jones withstood rainy weather and an elite field of 38 other
champions from the past two seasons, closing with a three-under-par 69
for a 72-hole total of seven-under-par 281 on the North-South course at
Grand Cypress in Orlando, Florida.
''I'm in shock,'' she said. ''You won't be able to get this silly grin
off my face for a few days.''
Beth Daniel, who shot a 71 for a 287 total, was the only other player
to finish under par. Pat Bradley (68) and Betsy King (72) followed at

IT may be a statement of the obvious that golf is not just a game any
more.
In the last 30 years, like so many other sports, it has evolved not
merely into a business but an industry. How can that claim be denied
when the lastest hi-tech, jumbo-headed driver can cost #500?
Recognition of this development was upheld at San Roque last week
during the seventh PGA European Tour training school, sponsored by
Apollo, the Birmingham-based company which makes a substantial
contribution to the total of 40m golf club shafts manufactured every
year throughout the world.
Apollo invest #40,000 and the Tour #10,000 in this venture which, as
the Tour's executive director, Ken Schofield, puts it: ''Gives a useful
grounding to the latest batch of recruits to a field of competitive
endeavour which holds out great rewards and bitter disappointment in
almost equal measure.
Dean Robertson, of Gleddoch, and Craig Ronald, of East Kilbride, were
among the two-dozen aspirants who took advantage of the opportunity to
be introduced to the complexities of the modern tournament existence as
well as receiving instruction from some of the game's most respected
figures.
It was quite something to observe John Jacobs, now 70, shuttling up
and down the practice tee, delighted to be able to advise the latest
generation of young professionals on the finer points of the swing; to
listen to Tommy Horton expounding on bunker play; and to catch Denis
Pugh videoing players' methods.
But every aspect of a tournament player's peripatetic life-style was
covered -- course disciplines, rules, diet, travel, physical fitness,
mental aptitude, client management, and dealing with the media were all
the subject of talks by those best qualified in their respective fields.
Older generations of golfers might find the programme too structured
and academic.
On the subject of psychology, after all, did not Arnold Palmer
famously respond to Tony Lema's question about how to win tournaments:
''I see what has to be done, and I do it.'' Matters are more complex
now, it seems.
Robertson was advised, for instance, of three ways of countering
pressure -- taking a deep breath, or saying to himself just before a
shot, ''back and hit,'' or as he walked between shots, to ensure that
his body language indicated a positive frame of mind.
The example of a successful graduate was fittingly on hand. Andrew
Coltart, who attended last year's seminar, went on to win the Scottish
Professional and Australian PGA titles and represent Scotland in the
Dunhill and World Cups -- all that after he had lost his card by
finishing 171st with winnings of #9792 in the 1993 order of merit,
regained it, and then last year earned #136,357 by finishing
forty-second.
Coltart, warming up elsewhere in Spain for the start of the European
season this week in Dubai with his coach Gordon Gray, paid a nostalgic
visit to last week's proceedings. He summed up: ''You take out of the
week what you want. There's so much input you can fill your head full of
nonsense if you are not careful.''
Robertson, hoping to follow Coltart's example, valued most the chance
to practice in good conditions after the winter break, restore his game
and begin thinking competitively again.
''It's a kick-start after the holidays,'' he said. ''No-one has to
come, but it's silly to turn down the opportunity.''
For Ronald the experience was ''a breath of fresh air,'' his lesson on
driving from Jacobs of particular value.
If this year's class perform as well as the last -- 20 players amassed
almost #1m on the tour, of whom half retained their cards -- their
exertions will have been worthwhile.

JOHN Morse shot his second consecutive bogey-free 65 at the Waialae
Club and took a two-stroke lead into the final round of the Hawaiian
Open in Honolulu.
Morse is on 201, 15 under par, after three rounds, two strokes ahead
of Chip Beck, who shot his second successive 66. Overnight leader Duffy
Waldorf dropped back to third place after a 71.
The key to Morse's scoring has been his success on the four par-5
holes, on which he has picked up 13 strokes over the three rounds.
The 36-year-old veteran is in just his second year on the US Tour,
having spent much of his career failing to get through the qualifying
school. He has played in Canada and Australia, winning the Australian
Open in 1990. Leading aggregates (Americans unless stated):
201 -- J Morse 71, 65, 65.
203 -- C Beck 71, 66, 66.
204 -- D Waldorf 68, 65, 71.

* ROOKIE Ron Whittaker, nephew of eight-times US Ryder Cup team member
Lannie Wadkins, yesterday posted the first victory of his short career
when he won the South African Players' championship by six strokes in
Durban.
Whittaker shot a two-under-par 70 to finish on an 270, 18 under par.
Ireland's John McHenry, who returned a 66, and Zimbabwe's Tony
Johnstone, who carded a 71, tied for second place on 278.
''I feel like I'm dreaming. I certainly never felt that I'd come out
here and win a tournament,'' said Whittaker. Leading aggregates:
270 -- R Whittaker (USA) 68, 64, 68, 70.
276 -- J McHenry (N Ireland) 69, 70, 71, 66; T Johnstone (Zimbabwe)

* GEORGE Gormley, of the Moray club, who was installed yesterday as
president of the Scottish Golf Union, identified his priority task as
establishing the way forward for the union's proposed national golf
centre.
''It is extremely important to get a sense of direction,'' he said
following the release of a feasibility study which placed doubts on the
suitability of Balbirnie Park, Fife, the site under examination for the
last six months.
Doubts concern image and anticipated use by club golfers other than
locals. Building residential accomodation, moreover, was thought to be
risky, but on a low-cost basis, practice and tuition facilities could be
provided, as could new offices.
Delegates at a seminar preceding the union's annual meeting yesterday
at Dalmahoy must now take the report back to their members for a
decision prior to the final vote on February 8 in Edinburgh. They must
decide whether to go for the full or restricted plan at Balbirnie Park,
to look at other sites, or to abandon the idea.
The centre, for which a special development fund of #400,000 has
accumulated in the union's accounts, has now been under discussion for
15 months.

IT is the custom with Scottish racecourses that a rider landing a
treble is presented with champagne.
But for Peter Niven, who partnered a double at Newcastle on Saturday,
the corks soon will be popping for another reason -- the jockey's son
William is due to be christened.
Niven, with a haul of 616 winners, is no stranger to the limelight and
is in the list of top 20-jump jockeys since the war, making him, in
numerical terms, the best jockey over obstacles Scotland has produced.
He admits to having a few more seasons in him, so it will surely not
be beyond the Tayside-born rider to climb even higher up the echelons of
this elite jumping club.
But Niven, like his contemporaries, faces an battle against the
scales.
However, hunger did not seem to reduce his strength in the saddle when
he drove Uncle Doug home at Newcastle, the pair holding 2-1 favourite
Top Cees.
Niven and Reveley later went on to score with Morgans Harbour, who won
the three-mile handicap hurdle in a canter.

IN 1982, when she travelled to her first athletics league meeting, the
12-year-old Mel Neef carried a magazine with a photo of Linsey Macdonald
on the cover. Her mother had given Neef the magazine to read on the bus,
and Mel sought Macdonald's autograph on arrival.
Yesterday, competing in the East of Scotland indoor championships at
Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, Neef smashed the Scottish 200 metres national
indoor record, set by Macdonald that same year, and also eclipsed Aileen
McGillivray's three-year-old native mark for the distance.
Her time, 24.16sec, was four hundredths inside that set by Macdonald
at Cosford, and relegated Edinburgh's Sinead Dudgeon to second with
24.55.
McGillivray had earlier beaten Neef narrowly, 7.39 to 7.45, over 60m,
improving her own national and native record best by 0.04sec. Neef's 60m
time was also her fastest.
The pair's record-breaking sprinting, and a Scottish native best for
1500m by Dundee's Ian Campbell, sent Scottish Athletic Federation
secretary Bob Greenoak sharply out of his blocks to a telephone,
attempting to ensure their consideration for forthcoming UK matches
against France and Russia.
Campbell, who made his Great Britain debut over the metric mile at the
European championships in Paris last winter, clocked 3min.45.26sec.,
almost three seconds faster than Alastair Currie's five-year-old native
record.
Neef, who reached the European and Commonwealth 400m finals last year,
has started even more impressively this winter. ''My coach, Bob Inglis,
reckons the key to improving my 400m running is sheer speed, so I've
been concentrating on the shorter distances,'' said Neef. ''I'll do the
same two events at the Scottish championships next weekend, but I want
to run the 400m at the world indoors.''
McGillivray was ecstatic at her return to form after two years of
injury and illness problems, and should win a UK place in this form.
Doug Walker had not trained since his New Year Sprint victory because
of an ear infection, but broke the championship record in the 400m,
recording 47.33. It was his first indoor run at this distance, and the
first time he had tackled the event since he was 16.
Tom McKean made a winning return at the West championships the
previous day, but with a modest 1-51.86, ahead of Ewan Calvert.
The most outstanding performances came from
17-year-old Ross Baillie, who won the senior 60m in 6.89 -- a
championship record and just three hundredths slower than East champion
Jamie Henderson.
In his first run over 3ft 6ins barriers, the Victoria Park prodigy won
the senior 60m hurdles title, breaking the Scottish under-20 record. His
younger brother, Chris, won two under-15 titles and set one record.

EDINBURGH Ladies are beginning to make a habit of beating their great
rivals Western Klick Photopoint. It was they who ended the Glasgow
hockey side's magnificent 176 game unbeaten record in November and on
Saturday they got the better of them 2-0 in the indoor league.
Edinburgh were deserved victors with goals on either side of half-time
by Gill Messenger and Fiona MacInnes, but neither side played to its
true potential.
Western slipped up in having seven players on the court at the same
time, costing them a penalty corner which Edinburgh converted to break
the deadlock five minutes from half-time.
The capital girls now move two points ahead of Western and Bonagrass
Grove and within reach of their third successive title.
Hyndland lost to Menzieshill, while Bonagrass had to settle for a 5-2
defeat against Edinburgh.
In the cup yesterday, Bonagrass and Edinburgh advanced to the
semi-finals at the expense of Highland and Hyndland. Western took their
disappointment out on Carmuirs, beating them 14-1.
It was left to second division side Clydesdale to produce an upset,
with a 4-3 victory over Menzieshill. They now meet Edinburgh in the
semis with Western taking on Bonagrass.
* IN Pool B of the men's play-offs, Touche Ross moved into pole
position following flawless performances against Livingston and Morgan.
Richard Freeland, their international striker, was responsible for six
of their 22 goals
Insights Inverleith have also accumulated maximum points. Their best
performance was a 10-2 victory over Clydesdale. EK Strathmore occupy
third place, one point behind the front runners. Results:

PAUL Evans, the Springburn Harrier who gave up Scottish nationality to
run for England, set a UK record when he won the Marakesh half marathon
yesterday in 60min 09sec, slicing 50 seconds from the mark which Steve
Jones set in 1986.
Karen Macleod staked a claim to a World championship marathon place
when finishing second in the women's race with 71-40.
''I didn't know there was a woman ahead of me -- it was a mixed
event,'' said Edinburgh's Macleod, who finished 14 seconds behind
Italy's Olga Ferraro, fourth in the European marathon event.
* TONY Johnston, the 24-year-old Scottish inter-services champion from
Irvine, was a surprise winner of the Jack Crawford Memorial Cup
5[1/2]-mile road race. One of four runners who entered the Huntershill

TOP-10 finishes by Border hill farmer Dave Cavers and Navy officer
Chris Robison salvaged respectability for Scotland at Luton on Saturday,
nurturing the hope of places in the UK team for the world championships.
But overall performances of the Scottish district squads in the
inter-county championships served only to re-expose the impoverished
state of the sport north of the Border.
A national development plan, shortly to be unveiled, has problems to
address.
Cavers, running for East of Scotland, finished fifth, 44sec behind
winner Spencer Duval, of Staffordshire. Robison (eighth), and Alaister
Russell (12) and Graeme Wight (19), helped West to fifth in the
championship.
But several English counties expressed anger that Northern Ireland
were allowed to send their national team, which won the senior title.
Yet West of Scotland could have been celebrating. Nine to run, six to
count, is the rule. West fielded just six, while back home were athletes
whose presence could have ensured victory.
Tommy Murray, Alan Puckrin, Robert Quinn, and Adrian Callan were
offered places but, for a variety of acceptable reasons, declined.
Cavalry-charge starts -- 350 people at a sprint over the opening 300
metres in the senior men's event -- were a new experience for many
Scots. Never up, never at the races, is the lesson which most will have
learned.
Teviotdale's Cavers, twice in the top-10 before, and Spango Valley's
Robison, only once out of it in 10 starts, knew that truth already.
Ten years ago, Cavers was a 13-stone prop with with Hawick YM, but
tending sheep and cattle on the family farm near Hawick is a rigorous
existence, and his racing weight is three stones lighter. This season's
area match winner, he has emerged as one of the most consistent, but
under-rated of Scots, and will be a serious national title contender.
Russell, a dairy farmer from near Symington, has never fulfilled his
promise. However, the 26-year old has struck a part-time agreement with
his father.
''I felt the work, which is physical, was too demanding for me to do
my running justice,'' said Russell. ''It's showing the benefit already.
This is my best finish.'' Alison Rose was the best female finisher,
seventeenth, with Lynn Harding, running for North-east England,
thirty-ninth.
Without having a runner in the top 20, the West junior women's squad
achieved the best team placing, fourth. One of their counters, Alexandra
Ercolan, hints at the way forward, but for cash-strapped Scotland, the
route may be barred.
Ercolan, a student at Glasgow University, has dual British and Italian
nationality. Her mother is from Glasgow, while her father is a skiing
and mountaineering instructor.
At 17 she had run 2-11 for 800m in Italy, and her club, Lazio, has
paid for her to fly home for matches.
Scottish clubs could not do this for a star, never mind a junior, even
one who says she would run for Scotland, rather than Italy, if given the
option. Results and Scottish placings:

FABRIZIO Ravanelli scored his second double in a week as Juventus
opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Italian first division
yesterday with a 3-0 victory over Roma in a match marred by the sending
off of three players.
Ravanelli scored in each half -- his second with a penalty -- with
Gianluca Vialli adding the other.
Both sides were reduced to 10 men after 75 minutes, when Roma keeper
Giovanni Cervone and Juventus defender Moreno Torricelli were red-carded
after a clash.
Roma's Fabio Petruzzi joined them eight minutes from time for a foul
on Vialli, which earned Juventus a penalty, converted by Ravanelli.
Parma were held 1-1 at Fiorentina, who took the lead through Gabriel
Batistuta's eighth-minute strike. Gabriele Pin levelled for Parma a
minute into the second half.
Lazio leapfrogged over Fiorentina and Roma into third place with a 7-1
win over Foggia, scoring four goals in the last seven minutes. Alen
Boksic celebrated his return from injury by hitting a hat trick against
a Foggia side reduced to 10 men just before half-time, when Giordano
Caini was sent for an early bath.

JOE Royle, whose career in charge of Everton had begun so promisingly,
does not have his problems to seek after a double-blow over the weekend.
The first disciplinary misdemeanour of Duncan Ferguson's new career in
England on Saturday probably had Royle thinking about a serious move to
sign Mark Hughes from Manchester United as the Scot's temporary
replacement and long-term partner.
Then came the second blow -- Hughes suffered a gash to a knee as he
scored against Newcastle yesterday and will be out of football for a
month.
Whatever the outcome of proceedings in court come May, Ferguson's
sending-off at Arsenal on Saturday, following his confrontation with
John Jensen, will mean an automatic three-match suspension that the
Merseyside club can ill afford as they struggle against the possibility
of relegation for the first time in 40 years.
Although Royle's arrival as manager, like Brian Little's at Aston
Villa, brought an immediate improvement in results, both are now
realising that wins rather than draws are required in order to escape
one of the four places which this season mean a financially disastrous
drop to the Endsleigh League.
Useful as the 1-1 draw at Highbury looks, especially with 10 men
following Ferguson's dismissal after 52 minutes, Everton slipped back
into the bottom three.
George Graham's disappointment at not having capitalised on Ian
Wright's early goal was, he insisted, ameliorated by a satisfactory
debut from striker John Hartson, Friday's #2.5m acquisition from Luton
Town. Hartson, a Welsh Under-21 internationalist, is promising, though
no more than that at this stage.
Chris Kiwomya, signed on the same day from Ipswich, was promising two
years ago but has not developed since, and many Arsenal supporters are
convinced that the money for the two players should have been spent on,
say, Les Ferdinand, who has apparently been told he can leave Queen's
Park Rangers once they are safe from relegation.
That may be a while yet, because any side in the bottom half of the
table suddenly having a bad run will find themselves sinking into the
quicksand. West Ham have illustrated that, and are back in the bottom
four despite outplaying Tottenham for an hour of their London derby at
Upton Park.
Tony Cottee, who has always said that Frank McAvennie was his best
striking partner for either West Ham or Everton, has found an
interesting new accomplice in the 6ft 3in Dutchman Jeroen Boere, scorer
of the opening goal on Saturday.
Unfortunately for West Ham, Tottenham were galvanised by Gerry
Francis' half-time talk into taking a hold on the game and won it with
goals from Teddy Sheringham and Jurgen Klinsmann to maintain their
challenge for a UEFA Cup place.
Mark McGhee's Leicester are in a sorry state following a 2-0 defeat at
Crystal Palace and it will take more than the introduction of striker
Mark Robins from Norwich to bridge what is now a 10-point gap. It did
not help their predicament that Ipswich achieved the result of the day,
a 1-0 win at Liverpool, where they had never succeeded in 34 attempts.
Afterwards, Ipswich manager George Burley sounded just like
fellow-Scot Kenny Dalglish when he said: ''If you work hard and are
committed, you've always got a chance.''
Dalglish, meanwhile, was subduing any excitement with typical ease
after Blackburn's eleventh win in 12 games, at home to Nottingham
Forest. Although neither Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton on the one hand,
nor Stan Collymore and Bryan Roy on the other, made the scoresheet,
Blackburn were worthy winners again.
Had Shearer, at #3.3m from Southampton, been a flop in the past two
years, much of the heat might have been taken out of the domestic
transfer market. The realisation that he was a bargain prompted
Blackburn to go even higher for Sutton and led indirectly to Andy Cole's
move last week.
As Dalglish put it on Saturday: ''It doesn't matter what they cost,
it's what you get in return that counts.''

IN a seemingly unholy alliance, Pele and Maradona have found a common
aim to improve the lot of their fellow professionals.
One of Pele's first pledges on being appointed minister of sport in
Brazil was to dismantle their transfer system which he said was a form
of slavery.
Maradona has already taken the first steps towards setting up a world
players' union.
Pele, explaining his intentions, said: ''Players in Brazil must be 27
before they have any rights -- until then the clubs have total control
in all transfers, which is a form of slavery.
''This has to change and I will do everything possible towards this
end.''
According to Maradona, such international stars as Romario, Hristo
Stoichkov, Eric Cantona, Ruud Gullit, Enzo Francescoli and Manuel
Negrete, president of the Mexican Players Union, have agreed to support
his aims.
He said: ''We need to create an international union to protect all the
interests of players so that we no longer suffer at the hands of those
who govern us.''
* FRANK Ryjkaard has informed Ajax that he may quit at the end of the
season to concentrate on his new company which specialises in men's
underwear.
The Dutch club want to persuade the 32-year-old defender to do
otherwise because of his influence on their progress in the Champions'
League.
His former national captain, Ronald Koeman, is also considering a
drastic career switch from Barcelona to Groningen. The move would reduce
his earnings and audience tenfold but it would ring down the final
curtain for him beside his brother Erwin at the club where it all
started for them and where their father, Martin, is managing director.

* ANTI-terrorist measures are being enforced at the trial in Corsica
of the 12 people charged with causing the disaster at the
Bastia-Olympique Marseille game in which 17 were killed and 2000 injured
when a new stand in the Furiani Stadium collapsed on May 5, 1992.
Extra security was installed after the Bastia president, Jean-Francois
Fillipi, who was due to appear in court, was shot dead on his doorstep
on Boxing Day in what police believe was a revenge attack by relatives
of the victims.
Bullet-proof glass surrounds the defendants in the dock and 400 police
constantly guard the courthouse.
The principals in the case, Michel Cagnion, director general of the

director of the construction firm which had erected the stand, face a
possible five years in jail if found guilty.

THERE is nothing quite like a bit of transfer gossip to galvanise a
player into producing his best form, and maybe the public discussion
about his possible involvement in a move to Kilmarnock gave Willie
Falconer the injection he needed to show his worth.
At any rate, the former Aberdeen full back did a fine job as partner
for Pierre van Hooydonk, ironically against Kilmarnock.
Falconer was a willing and intelligent ally for the Dutchman, but also
did his bit for the Parkhead cause when he scored the opening goal,
albeit amid great controversy.
If Willie's intention was to demonstrate that he still has much to
contribute to Celtic, then he did so effectively, and manager Tommy
Burns will be obliged to consider him as a contender for the position on
a regular basis.
Others, not currently at the club, are being suggested as likelier
candidates, among them Mark Hughes, who seems certain to leave
Manchester United sooner rather than later, despite scoring for his club
at Newcastle and then being taken to hospital to have 12 stitches
inserted in a knee gash.
But Celtic fans had maybe not bank on seeing the Welshman in a hooped
shirt, unless the club is prepared to match some very fancy salary
figures which English teams surely will wave in front of the
31-year-old.
It might be more feasible that another foreigner will be in Celtic's
mind, but meantime Falconer, Andy Walker, and others on site will be
vying to double up with van Hooydonk.
The Dutchman looked a real player, even if he did not get on the score
sheet this time, and despite having his name taken inside the first 15
seconds for a lunge at Colin McKee.
He was also the man who raised the ire of Kilmarnock when he went down
like a dynamited chimney to earn a penalty in the last minute. Pierre
already looks like the kind of man who will make headlines one way or
another.
His manager, Tommy Burns, was a happy man, unlike his opposite number,
Alex Totten, who led a group of angry players on to the team bus
afterwards.
To a man, they were convinced they had been denied at least a point
and probably three. Two incidents raised the Killie blood pressure --
the Falconer goal and that late penalty which gave Celtic victory.
''They are angry because they are certain Falconer handled the ball
before he scored,'' said Totten, ''and as far as the penalty is
concerned, Mark Skilling says the Dutchman was backing into him when
they fell.''
From the press box high above the stand, it was not easy to be certain
in either case, but TV evidence seems to support the Kilmarnock version.
There did not seem to be any deliberate hand-ball by Falconer as he
jostled with a couple of defenders on his way to hitting his shot high
into the net, despite a brave effort by Dragoje Lekovic to halt it. But
Kilmarnock will argue that the camera backs their case.
And at the time, the penalty award to Celtic seemed soft. In fact,
Skilling and his mates were convinced the Dutchman had taken a dive and,
if so, it is not the kind of Continental expertise that will endear him
to opposing fans.
Referee Bill Crombie, who is never slow to administer punishment for
such behaviour, clearly believed Pierre was hampered as he turned to
chase the ball nodded on by Falconer. The end result was a well-taken
penalty by John Collins, who agreed it might have been a ''soft'' award,
but also pointed out that it was the first penalty the team had been
given this season.
The injustice may have been hard to take, but Skilling's reaction when
he refused to shake hands with van Hooydonk at the end, preferring to
signal his disgust with a vulgar gesture, was silly and might well land
him in trouble if the referee or the supervisor reports it to the
authorities.
Kilmarnock's annoyance at losing was understandable, none the less.
They had looked capable of winning the game themselves in the second
half and, even after Falconer had scored, they came back to level terms
with a penalty which had no question marks around it.
Mark McNally brought down McKee after the Killie man beat him cleverly
inside the area. Tom Black gave Pat Bonner no chance with the spot-kick.
That encouraged the Ayrshire side, who took the initiative in midfield
again, but even so, van Hooydonk could easily have scored twice in the
closing minutes.
Totten's men will play worse and win but, however they perform, they
are a hard side to put down. Burns was relieved that the seemingly
endless series of draws was not continued, but while he was happy with
the front two, there were other sections of the side which did not
shine. The defence, makeshift as he called it, was none too comfortable
and the midfield did not take charge of the game as players of their
quality should.
''We probably got the rub of the green,'' said Burns. No-one in the
Ayrshire team bus was arguing.

EOIN Jess, after having been demoted to the substitutes' bench for a
month, showed on Saturday he is prepared to fight to gain a permanent
place in the Aberdeen and Scotland teams, when he was given his first 90
minutes of football for more than a month.
''Now I have to play like that every game,'' he said after having made
a major contribution to Aberdeen's 3-1 victory over Partick Thistle, who
for almost half the game had to play with 10 men.
Rod McDonald, who was booked in the first half for persistent fouling,
was sent off just four minutes after the break for a dangerous tackle on
McKimmie, and with one man short, Thistle could not contain Aberdeen,
who were playing with confidence.
Aberdeen were boosted by a lucky goal in just three minutes. Billy
Dodds crossed from the left and Alan Dinnie lunged at the ball,
miskicked, and sliced it over his keeper's head and into the net.
It had been nine months since Jess last scored for Aberdeen -- and he
delivered Aberdeen's second in tremendous style. The ball fell to him
just inside the box and he curved it over the defence and wide of keeper
Nicky Walker into the corner of the net.
Duncan Shearer, who had been supportive of Jess during his lean spell
but had also told him he needed a ''kick up the backside,'' scored
Aberdeen's third when he headed a perfectly timed Miller lob past
Walker.
Pittman pulled one back with four minutes to go, when he was left
unmarked at the back post and drilled the ball past a helpless Theo
Snelders, who lost his temper and found his name in the referee's book.
One Aberdeen player clearly frustrated that he did not score was
record signing Dodds, who did a power of work but has now gone eight
matches without a goal.
Stephen Wright had an excellent game for Aberdeen, but had to be
substituted with 15 minutes to go because of a nose injury.
The victory leapfrogged Aberdeen over Dundee United and Falkirk into
sixth position in the table, their highest placing since the beginning
of October.
Manager Willie Miller praised a number of good individual performances
within a good team performance and said of Jess: ''He had a very good
game for us and has been showing signs of getting back to his true form.
If he performs the way he can, I am delighted to have a player of his
calibre back in the team, but that is something you have to do week in,
week out. That goes for Eoin Jess, for Duncan Shearer, for anybody.''
Jess was delighted to have started a game and was pleased with his own
performance. Missing the past two Scotland matches also clearly hurt.
''It was very disappointing to see the boys going away and not be
involved,'' he said. ''I'll have to see if I can catch Duncan now. He's
been top scorer too long.''
Thistle manager John Lambie believed at half-time his team could take
something out of the game because Aberdeen were vulnerable at the back.
He clearly felt the sending-off was unnecessary and said: ''It is the
customers I feel sorry for, because it was a good game up until then.''
Lambie took off Charnley and Turner when they were three down to
ensure they did not pick up any disciplinary points.

WILLIE Jamieson, whose first goal for Hearts wrapped up the points
against sad Dundee United at Tynecastle at the weekend, revealed
afterwards that the shadow of suspended Craig Levein could be one of the
reasons for his outstanding form since joining the club from Partick
Thistle last month.
Levein has now completed a 10-match SFA ban, and while he may not have
the necessary fitness for Wednesday's derby match against Hibernian,
Jamieson is all too aware that his own first-team days could be numbered
if his form dips.
Hearts never looked in any kind of trouble against United, but only a
headed goal by John Millar, seconds before half-time, separated the
sides until Jamieson came charging forward to head the second, following
a free kick from Colin Miller, after 73 minutes. That, added to some
solid defending, put him just a shade behind man-of-the-match Stephen
Frail, but Jamieson realises he cannot afford to sit back and savour
such performances.
''I've got the threat of Craig Levein hanging over me,'' he said.
''When I was with Partick Thistle earlier this season, I was probably
showing my worst form since joining them. Ironically, I got a move to
Hearts and things have taken off for me.
''I'm under no illusions, however. It's up to me to show the manager
that I deserve to keep my place, and I would dearly love to play against
Hibs.''
Jamieson, of course, began his senior career with the Easter Road
club, before moving to Hamilton and then Partick Thistle. The
31-year-old revealed: ''In all my time at Easter Road I never played in
a winning side in the Edinburgh derby. Now I may get the chance to put
that right.''
Jamieson played for Hibs against Hearts seven times, suffering two
defeats and playing in five drawn matches. But if Hearts fans think he
could be a bit of a jinx, then they can relax, for Jamieson can also
point out that he has never played in a losing side at Tynecastle in the
derby match.
Hearts have injury problems for Wednesday. Neil Berry, Scott Leitch,
and Kevin Thomas all face fitness tests, and John Colquhoun, a
substitute at the weekend, could not have played, even if he had been
needed. He overstretched during the pre-match warm-up and had to have
pain-killing injections at half-time.
Dundee United's problem was there for all to see on Saturday, and
unless they can find a fighting quality, the threat of relegation will
remain. Said coach Paul Hegarty: ''The players must look closely at
themselves. They must show much more commitment.''

JUST look at the premier division table. Take a good look . . . study
the positions and points carefully, and then say Scottish football is
heading in the correct direction.
How can the domestic game be in good health when Rangers, who by their
own manager's admission have not been functioning at a particularly high
level, are now 14 points clear of the rest? Also, it is beginning to
look as though Rangers could win the championship by a record margin.
Rangers also had their problems last season, yet went on to win their
sixth successive title because no-one had the talent and the resources
to end the Ibrox side's dominance. A season on, Walter Smith finds he
still does not have any genuinely serious contenders, even when his side
has been ravaged by injury problems since the first ball of the campaign
was kicked.
Anyone who feels this is demeaning the Scottish game or showing total
disregard for the other professionals in the premier division should
consider that Smith took to Brockville a team minus Andy Goram, Richard
Gough, Basile Boli, Alexei Mikhailichenko, Mark Hateley, Ally McCoist,
and Brian Laudrup.
Also, John Brown, who played against Falkirk, is still making his way
back after injury problems which kept him sidelined virtually from the
beginning of the season, and Trevor Steven, who was on the bench, was in
the first-team squad for the first time since last May.
Yet, Rangers, with not a recognised goalscorer in sight and without
reaching any great heights of excellence, scored three goals and
gathered in three more points. Please, don't tell me Scottish football
is in good shape when all the evidence suggests there is one team,
Rangers, and then a posse of also-rans.
Rangers also can afford to off-load Pieter Huistra, who scored two
goals against Falkirk in his final match for the club before setting off
on an adventure in the J League with Hiroshima. The Dutchman, who has
always flattered to deceive, would certainly not have been sold off for
#500,000 had he been contributing in such an exciting fashion as this on
a regular basis.
Huistra's first goal was scored from the penalty spot after John
Hughes had lunged into Charlie Miller a minute into first-half injury
time. Hughes was not at all pleased and his anger was to cause him to be
shown a red card in the tunnel at the end of the game.
Tony Parks got a touch on Huistra's penalty, but could not stop the
ball hitting the net, and Rangers' supporters probably thought their
side would cruise to another win. It didn't work like that.
A long clearance in 73 minutes by Parks carried to the edge of
Rangers' box, where Fraser Wishart -- half-time substitute for Craig
Moore, who had taken a head knock -- failed in an attempt to head back
to Ally Maxwell. Colin McDonald darted in and scored.
Eddie May then dived and headed the loose ball in for Falkirk's second
after Maxwell had done remarkably well to parry Nicky Henderson's
powerful shot, and it looked then as though Rangers' erratic form would
cost them dearly.
However, Huistra, who did well to make space for himself 20 yards out,
scored a splendid goal to restore hope. In the closing seconds of the
match Ian Ferguson played a precise pass through to Miller, whose shot
was blocked by Parks, but Stuart McCall arrived at speed to slide the
ball in.
Hughes complained that Miller had been offside, but he was too
forceful in his protestations and was shown a red card, which means he
will miss tomorrow night's game against Partick Thistle.
Referee Jim McGilvray booked nine players in a match which was free of
real malice and the official's behaviour served only to interrupt what
little fluency of play there was. His performance was poor and, to be
frank, underlined the need for the game's authorities to accept another
truth. The standard among Scottish referees also is in decline.

HUNTLY manager Steve Paterson paid tribute to his squad after they
survived a late shake-up to come through the Tennents Scottish Cup derby
replay by 3-1 against Keith.
Regular full back Arthur Murphy suffered knee-ligament damage in
midweek training, but Niall Grant, drafted in for his first full start
of the season, was a star as Huntly set up a third-round clash at home
to Burntisland Shipyard.
Keith took the lead in only seven minutes through a classy finish from
striker Andy Lavelle. But Huntly took the aerial route to the next
round.
Ex-Don Doug Rougvie equalised in 23 minutes, then Martin Stewart
headed a second in 49 minutes. Former Forfar striker Gary Whyte made the
tie safe 14 minutes left from time with another header.
Helped by an Alan Kennedy double, Montrose beat Whitehill Welfare 5-2
to earn a tie at home to Hibs.
Late goals were the main feature in the second division. Morton fell
behind to a John Gallacher volley for Berwick and it looked worse when
Derek McInnes was sent off just after the hour mark. Only seven minutes
remained when Marko Rajamaki volleyed in the equaliser and a penalty by
Derek Lilley three minutes from time.
Stenhousemuir went ahead through Gareth Hutchison and then an Adrian
Sprott penalty after John Dickson had hit Clyde's first equaliser. With
only three minutes left Gordon Parks restored equality. Stirling
Albion's 3-0 win over East Fife came via an Ian McInnes hat trick.
Queen of the South had a goalless draw with Dumbarton while newcomer
James McKellar set Brechin on the way to a 3-1 win over Meadowbank which
was secured by a Gavin Price double, the first a penalty.
Forfar moved four points clear in the third division by beating
Queen's Park 3-0 and Keith Ferries hit two as Ross County won by the
same score at Cowdenbeath to go up into joint-second place. Dave
Brennan's last-minute header from a Wilson Robertson cross earned Caley
Thistle a draw with Arbroath at Inverness, where the home
player-manager, Sergei Baltacha, was stretchered off late on.

LATE goals were the main feature of the second division programme,
with Morton staging a 10-man comeback win over second-placed Berwick,
while the leaders were denied victory by a Clyde equaliser at
Stenhousemuir.
The late activity had the effect of preventing a breakaway by the top
two, as Berwick would have been six points clear of the third-placed
club had the matches finished at 4.30.
A crowd of just under 2000 at Greenock saw Morton fall behind to John
Gallacher's goal for Berwick just after the break and it looked even
worse for the home side when Derek McInnes was sent off just after the
hour mark. Only seven minutes remained when Finn Marko Rajamaki volleyed
in the equaliser and a penalty by Derek Lilley three minutes from time
completed an unlikely win.
Meanwhile, after a goalless first half, 'Muir had gone ahead of Clyde
through Gareth Hutchison and then an Adrian Sprott penalty after John
Dickson had driven in Clyde's first equaliser. Only three minutes
remained when Gordon Parks knocked in the leveller.
There was never much doubt about Stirling Albion's 3-0 victory over
East Fife, revenge for an opening day defeat at Forthbank, courtesy of
an Ian McInnes hat trick. His goals came from a lob, a header, and an
angular drive.
Queen of the South had most of the play in the goalless home draw with
Dumbarton.
Brechin City had a rare victory. Newcomer James McKellar set them on
the way to a 3-1 win over Meadowbank which was secured by a Gavin Price
double, the first a penalty, before Stuart Sorbie netted a consolation.
Forfar moved four points clear in the third division by beating
Queen's Park 3-0 while Keith Ferries hit a double in Ross County's win
by the same score at Cowdenbeath.
Dave Brennan's last-minute header earned Caley Thistle a point at home
to Arbroath.
Alloa scrambled a late goal at Albion Rovers through Keith McCulloch's
header from a corner after the visitors' Willie Newbigging had missed a
penalty against the 10 men -- Rovers' Lee Collins was sent off once
again.
Helped by an Alan Kennedy double, Montrose proved too strong for
Whitehill Welfare. A 5-2 win over the Midlothian club earned the Angus
team a Tennents Scottish Cup third-round tie at home to Hibs.
Headers by 39-year-old Doug Rougvie, Martin Stewart, and Gary Whyte
gave Huntly a 3-1 replay victory over Keith and a home tie against Fife
minnows, Burntisland Shipyard.

THE pressure created by the four leagues of 10 is coming home to roost
in the first division -- and the season is barely into the second half.
Dundee manager Jim Duffy seemed to be remarkably composed after his
side not only had lost their unbeaten home record and failed to score
for the first time this season -- that's 29 matches -- but one of the
team had become involved in a verbal stushie going up the tunnel at the
end.
Dunfermline's Bert Paton tried to keep himself slightly more detached
by sitting in the stand at Love Street to analyse why his side were in
the middle of a form slump. Two goals lost, plus skipper Norrie McCathie
being ordered off, soon had him back on the touchline as the Fifers
dropped yet more points in the draw at Love Street
Hamilton's leader, Iain Munro, expressed his sympathy for the fans who
had to watch a game against Stranraer at Firhill which ended with three
points for the Accies thanks to a last-minute Peter Duffield strike. And
Raith Rovers had the edge knocked off their fifth win on the trot with
the red-carding of Under-21 striker Colin Cameron -- one of their stars
in recent games -- against Clydebank at Stark's Park.
Manager Jimmy Nicholl reorganised his side, but it took a man who has
sinned as much as he has saved, the mercurial defender Shaun Dennis, to
snatch the only goal with seconds remaining.
Bankies coach Brian Wright's nerves also were showing when he rapped:
''Sheer lack of professionalism cost us the game.'' Bankies' peril in
fourth-bottom spot is the obvious reason for that, as is that of Ayr
United manager Simon Stainrod, who hauled in his squad yesterday after
having gone down 3-1 to St Johnstone at Somerset Park.
But at Dundee, the ''stairheid brawl'' took the gloss off a game that
Airdrie deservedly won. As the teams trooped off, the end result of the
verbals was a tangle between Dundee defender Noel Blake and Airdrie
keeper John Martin.
In they were marched to referee Mike Pocock's room, and told they
would be reported to the SFA for their ''aggressive manner.'' This will
be akin to a booking.
Of Blake, manager Duffy said: ''Although there was no scuffle, Noel
Blake will be fined under the club's disciplinary procedure. When you
have just been beaten, people say the wrong things, even try to rub it
in. But you have to be professional on and off the park.''
Airdrie's Alex MacDonald was delighted that his team had turned the
corner after their bad run over the festive season -- despite Jimmy
Boyle missing a first-half penalty.

PERHAPS they should consider opening an accident and emergency unit at
the Borough Briggs ground. Managers these days are forever moaning about
injury problems, but no-one can doubt that Elgin City have been dealt a
remarkably bad hand in that respect this season.
Manager Ian Fleming must have felt like holding his team-talks in the
local doctor's surgery at some points, and the latest run of casualties
came in the 0-0 North Cup draw against Caledonian Thistle, when Ian
Porteous was stretchered off with a bad shin injury.
Forwards are already at a premium for City, whose impressive defence
contrasts with an unproductive set of forwards. With no money to buy
replacements, Fleming hopes the sale of keeper Craig Hinchcliffe will
provide funds. Aberdeen and Falkirk have both followed up their interest
in Hinchcliffe, while Huddersfield are finalising a bid.
In the other first-round cup-ties, Lossiemouth's new player-coach,
Mike Cormack, was on the scoresheet in a 3-2 win at Nairn County. Ian
Stewart and Ian Shaw also netted for Lossie, although Nairn made them
work for the victory.
Sadly, the same could not be said of non-league Golspie, who allowed
Clach to run up their biggest win of the season -- 6-0.
Fort William's tie against Ross County's second string was postponed
because of a waterlogged pitch.
In the Highland League, Brora Rangers continued a fine season with a
4-0 win over second-placed Peterhead. Jocky MacKay and David Ross both
grabbed doubles as Brora kept alive their title ambitions.
Cove Rangers maintained their challenge with a 3-2 win at Deveronvale
thanks to Alan Leslie (2) and Mike Beattie. Ian Wooley and Murray
Ritchie were on target for Vale.
Buckie Thistle's Ronnie Smith netted an injury-time equaliser to deny
newcomers Wick Academy their eighth win of the season. Richard Hughes
had given Wick a tenth minute lead.
Forres's completed their sixth game without a win when they were
beaten 3-1 at home by Fraserburgh.

<HEADLINE>Britain's beaches 'dirtier than ever' despite clean-up</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S beaches are as filthy as ever despite multi-billion pound
clean-up campaigns, says a report today.
As in previous years, 45% of the coast was considered polluted,
according to a watchdog body, Norwich Union Coastwatch UK.
But for the first time in six years of such surveys, the amount of
coastline considered of excellent quality fell from 10% to 8%.
Coastwatch UK surveyed 1150 miles of coastline in September and
October last year. It found nearly 36,000 items of sewage-related waste,
1122 medical items, more than 31,000 cans, and more than 41,000 plastic
bags. There were also visible sewage slicks along 50 miles of coastline.
'' ''We've confirmed a high base line level of pollution and the
overall quality of our coastline is still deteriorating,'' said the
group's co-ordinator, Dr Gareth Rees.
''It's an inescapable fact that the nation's coastline remains
contaminated with an unacceptable level of revolting waste.''
However, the Water Services Association said billions of pounds were
being invested in improved sewage treatment. Eight in 10 bathing beaches
now met mandatory standards set by the European Bathing Water Directive,
it claimed.
Another survey out today says sightseeing is replacing sunbathing as a
favourite occupation for holidaymakers.
More than one in three tourists likes to take in the local culture on
the first day abroad while only one in four heads for the beach, said
the survey from the First Choice holiday company.
The survey, taken from interviews with more than 1000 people and
conducted by Gallup, also showed that price was the main consideration
when choosing a holiday, with women being more cost-conscious than men.
More than three in five holidaymakers plumped for the security of
travellers' cheques, with foreign currency cash being most popular among
16-24 year olds.

<HEADLINE>Charles's valet suspended after claims of meetings with Camilla</HEADLINE>

POLICE were yesterday being consulted about royal security following
the suspension of a valet amid claims about meetings between the Prince
of Wales and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles.
Buckingham Palace said Mr Ken Stronach was suspended on full pay
pending an investigation to be carried out by the Prince's private
secretary, Commander Richard Aylard.
The claims were made in the News of the World and were accompanied by
a photograph said to show the Prince's bedside table, complete with a
picture of Mrs Parker Bowles.
Mr Stronach, 50, whose job entails looking after Prince Charles's
wardrobe and travel arrangements, has worked for the Prince and Princess
of Wales for 15 years.
Royal employees are forbidden from speaking to the press by their
contracts.
However, yesterday's front page story claimed that Prince Charles made
love to Mrs Parker Bowles in the garden at his Highgrove home while the
Princess of Wales was asleep in the house.
Mr Stronach was quoted as saying he had to clean grass stains from the
Prince's pyjamas.
''They'd obviously been doing it in the open air,'' he said.
The article also claimed that Camilla, whose divorce from her husband,
Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, was announced last Tuesday, used to
sneak into Charles's bedroom at night, when she was staying there and
the Princess was not.
The article featured a full-page photograph of Charles's bedside
table. On it sat a framed picture of a smiling Mrs Parker Bowles,
sitting in the sun.
A boy seen at the window behind her is said by the paper to be Prince
William. It claims the picture was taken at Birkhall, the Queen Mother's
Scottish home.
Mr Stronach said he felt ''let down'' by the Prince after the
broadcast of Jonathan Dimbleby's documentary last year.
''All through my time with him we've all been told not to speak to
anyone about everything. We've all kept his secrets and the strain made
me very ill.
''Then he does a TV show and book telling the world what we spent
years hiding. Everything he told us to do was a lie. I feel let down,''
he said.
Meanwhile, a majority of people want Prince William -- if he reaches
the age of 18 before the Queen abdicates or dies -- rather than the
Prince of Wales to inherit the crown, according to a new poll.
A telephone survey of 1000 people for the Sunday Express shows 54%
think Prince William should succeed to the throne in those
circumstances, compared to 42% who disagree.
William will be 18 in six years, and the Queen, now 68, shows no signs
of abdicating.
The majority, 56%, also think the Princess Royal would make a better
monarch than Charles, 37%.
But if his long-term intention is to marry Camilla, the newspaper says
there were ''signs of a stirring of support for her either as a future
Queen or as a consort''.
Some 22% said they would accept Camilla as Queen -- a small
improvement in the past few months, according to the newspaper -- and
45% would be content to see her in the role of consort.
The long-term prospects for the monarchy look grim. The poll shows
more than one in four now think the monarchy will go in the next 10
years, and 29% say they would be better off without a royal family now.
Elsewhere, a Harris poll for the Sunday Times shows only 17% would
like to see Camilla become Queen if Charles married her, while 70% would
not, and 43% believe Charles should still become King if he married her,
while 47% did not.

THE industrial tribunal into the sacking of Mr Donald Maclean as
director of An Comunn Gaidhealach begins in Stornoway today despite last
ditch attempts by legal representatives to come to some kind of
agreement over the weekend.
Mr Maclean, 58, who had worked for An Comunn for 16 years, first as
its Western Isles regional director until six years ago when he was
appointed national director, was suspended on full pay on January 14 of
last year. The move came just days after Mr Donald John MacSween had
taken up the newly created post of chief executive with An Comunn.
Officially Mr Maclean's suspension was made pending a review of the
whole An Comunn organisation, but on March 29 Mr Maclean was dismissed
for alleged gross misconduct. This had followed a report from
Inverness-based chartered accountants Scott Oswald &amp; Co who had
completed an audit on An Comunn which had examined the running of the
fringe programme and the National Mod in Airdrie in October 1993.
Mr MacLean has consistently denied any financial irregularity.
He claims unfair dismissal. His case had been due to be heard in
Stornoway in early November but had to be postponed when Mr MacLean was
forced to change his plans for legal representation at the last moment.
He has been unemployed since his dismissal, apart from short periods of
supply teaching. Last night he would make no comment. ''I don't think
that would be very wise at this stage,'' he said.
But The Herald has learned that his lawyers and those acting for An
Comunn were locked in negotiation yesterday afternoon in an attempt to
find some kind of accommodation before the tribunal opened.
When asked about such moves last night Mr MacSween said: ''All I can
say at this time is that the industrial tribunal will go ahead.''

MICHAEL Chang emerged as a genuine contender for next week's
Australian Open with a straight-sets victory over world No. 1 Pete
Sampras in the final of the Colonial Classic yesterday.
Chang secured a 7-6, 6-3 success over his fellow American in
Melbourne, following wins over Boris Becker and Pat Cash at the
eight-man exhibition event.
Even though Sampras was clearly in no mood to over-exert himself with
the year's first Grand Slam tournament starting today, he admitted
Chang's serve had surprised him.
''That's the best he's ever served against me,'' he said -- after
watching 10 aces fly past him in a match which lasted only 68 minutes.''
Chang said: ''Whenever you go in against players like Pete, you take
everything you can get.''
* ARGENTINA'S Gabriela Sabatini posted a warning to her rivals on the
eve of the Australian Open by winning the New South Wales Open in Sydney
-- her second successive WTA title.
The world No. 6 beat American top seed Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 6-4 in
the final to confirm her resurgence after a troubled last two years.
Second-seed Sabatini overwhelmed Davenport in 74 minutes to reclaim
the title she won in 1992, and repeat her victory over the 6ft. 2ins.
18-year-old in the final of the Virginia Slims Championship in New York
two months ago.
That win ended a barren period for Sabatini who had not taken a title
since 1992.
''I did not do anything wrong or make too many errors,'' Sabatini said
afterwards. ''This was good preparation for the Australian Open.''
Unseeded American Patrick McEnroe claimed his first singles title in
seven years in the men's event. McEnroe, for so long overshadowed by
elder brother John, beat Aussie Richard Fromberg 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).

DARREN Gough's inspiration has now helped give English cricket another
boost -- in India.
Richard Stemp, fast emerging as a viable successor to Phil Tufnell in
the England Test side, paid tribute to Gough's example after playing a
starring role for England A in Bangalore yesterday.
Left-arm spinner Stemp, who says he is deliberately bowling in
sunglasses to stop opposing batsmen from seeing his eyes, took four for
27 today -- and six for 83 overall -- as India A collapsed to 300 all
out in the first Test.
And that brilliant performance in the field, which shot India A down
from their overnight 236 for four, was followed by quality batting on an
already turning pitch as England's youngsters replied with 153 for three
by the end of the second day.
Half-centuries from Jason Gallian and Nick Knight, with Gallian's
masterly 58 matched for assurance by Mark Ramprakash's 30 not out have
the A team in fine shape against a talented Indian side.
But it was 27-year-old Stemp's performance which most caught the eye
-- simply because it confirmed just what giant strides the Yorkshire
spinner has made on this tour, having been branded temperamental earlier
in his career. Scores:
INDIA A 300 (V Rathore 90, R Dravid 60; R D Stemp 6-83); ENGLAND A
153-3 (J Gallian 58, N Knight 50).
AUSTRALIA A 209 for eight (M Bevan 73, M. Hayden 50; C McDermott
4-25); AUSTRALIA 213 for five (M Slater 92). First B &amp; H World Series
final in Sydney. Australia won by five wickets.
WEST INDIES 273 for three (S Williams 121, S Campbell 108); SIR JOHN
BRIERLEY XI 232 for six (N Astle 59 n.o.). One-day tour match in
Hamilton, New Zealand. West Indies won by 41 runs.

Heriot's FP 22, Currie 11
WITH four championship matches remaining, Heriot's defeat of Currie
probably ensured their place in next season's re-vamped first division.
Currie, who have been resigned to dropping a division for some months,
showed enough in a second half revival to offer hope that they will soon
be challenging to rejoin the top league.
The Heriot's pack can usually be counted on to ensure a ready supply
of possession, but on this occasion very little was made of it. An
exception was their opening try after 36 minutes. After winning a
lineout Cameron Glasgow was released and he sent his centre, Gordon
Lawrie, scurrying over in the corner.
Peter Hewitt landed two penalties before Lawrie's try to give his side
a lead of 11-0 at half-time and then two more in the second period.
After two first-half penalty misses, Currie's Ally Donaldson was
successful with a brace in the second half.
But with Heriot's camped on Currie's line, the visitors' lineout throw
bobbled around until Kenny Milne flopped on it for an easy score.
Currie, though, enjoyed a better second half and scored a deserved try
six minutes from the end. Donaldson's short penalty was taken on by
Irish prop, Clem Boyd, and scrum half Rory Dickson forced his way over.
Heriot's FP -- C Aitken; H Gilmour, A McRobbie, G Lawrie, P Hewitt; C
Glasgow, D Fowler; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, C Humphries, P Young, S
Elliot, G Simpson, G Dall. Replacement -- A Binnie for Bryce (66

Hawick 14, Stirling County 10
THERE would not be all that much wrong with the Scottish club game if
sides in general would follow the encouraging example of Hawick and
Stirling County.
On Saturday these teams set before a riveted audience on a windswept
mud bath at Mansfield Park, a full-blooded, pressurised contest.
It contained magnificent commitment and a rich mix of drive and spread
in which a late series of sweeping, handling attacks by County had the
Hawick support anxiously on the edge of their seats and longing for
time.
The match not only was a tribute to the unfettered application of all
31 players and to international referee Ray Megson, who kept a strong
hand on the tiller, but also to all four coaches, Billy Murray, Jim
Renwick, Brian Edwards, and Muff Scobie, for encouraging such a
rollicking, fluent spectacle in such testing conditions.
Hawick made light of facing the elements in the first half by taking
charge at the lineouts, where they benefited from the replacement
appearance of the 6ft 6in. South African Stuart Henderson.
That further accentuated the absence from the Stirling line of Malcolm
Norval, especially as Ian Elliot and Brian Renwick also proved handsome
suppliers.
With John Gibson also missing from the Stirling tight five, Hawick's
forwards stood firm in the scrummages but were taught a lesson in
stealing ball, an area in which Kevin McKenzie, Brian Ireland, and
Stewart Hamilton proved past masters.
In a whole series of forward drives Jim Hay, who became a father on
Thursday, and Derek Turnbull vied with Gordon Mackay, Gareth Flockhart,
and Jim Brough in standing-off roles.
Hawick sought to free Tony Stanger from the close clutches of Ian
Jardine and managed that once profitably in the creation of their try.
Their entire back division tackled like dervishes, with David Grant
setting a notable example while Greig Oliver provided an amalgam of
running threat and clearance reliability.
Craig Sangster overcame an uncertain start to play a helpful, attack
role, very little got past Jardine, but the outstanding back afield was
Kenny Logan, technically sound in defence and a constant threat,
especially in that late Stirling surge when he once kicked ahead and was
taken out. On two other sorties was checked within strike distance and
once just failed to release an unmarked Mark McKenzie.
Hawick led 14-3 after 64 minutes from three penalty goals by Scott
Welsh and a cracking try by Gregor Sharp. Grant's dexterous pick-up and
miss pass released Oliver, Stanger eased away from Angus Turner before
relaunching Grant, who feinted in and swayed out as prelude to sending
Sharp home.
Mark McKenzie had opened the scoring with a penalty goal and brought
Stirling into close contention by converting a sizzling try by Turner.
After Brough and Hamilton had made dents, Ken Harper, Mark McKenzie,
Jardine, Matt McGrandles, and Sangster produced another sequence of
Stirling handling that defied the elements.
The final act was a match-saving tackle by the indefatigable Turnbull
that denied Mackay just a metre away from glory.
Hawick -- G H Oliver; C A Murray, D S Grant, A G Stanger, G W J Sharp;
S W Welsh, K W Reid; B J McDonnell, J A Hay, K B Scott, A Imray, I
Elliot, D J Turnbull, B L Renwick, J Graham. Replacement -- S J

West of Scotland 13, Jed-Forest 7
IT was a crunch game for both clubs and it showed. Indecision, dropped
passes, and the suppression of flair were all ingredients of players
feeling the pressure of league rugby, in this case the fear of
relegation.
West did themselves a favour by pulling two points clear of Jed, but
results elsewhere still left them in the lower-six area which spells a
step down next season. To be fair, there was not much between the sides,
but West earned their victory for snatching the few chances that came
their way.
Jed, for a Border team normally endowed with inborn ball-retaining
ability, surprisingly were turned over time and again when in
possession. And yet, behind their pack, they appeared to have the more
penetrative backs.
For the first quarter of the match, West found the perfect gel. The
forwards rucked and drove with fervour and fly half David Barrett was
producing inviting passes for Chris Hart and John Lonergan to indulge in
crash-ball tactics.
Not unusually, Barrett gave West the opening points with a penalty in
eight minutes, yet would have been behind had not Cliff Richards been
out of tune with his kicking and missed two penalty awards in the space
of five minutes.
The Burnbrae side then lost their cohesion and Jed clicked for a grand
try four minutes from the interval. Harry Hogg, Andy Douglas, and Mike
Yule all combined to stretch West's defence before Graham Renwick slung
out a long pass to hooker Kevin Barrie and he squeezed in at the left
corner. Richards converted with a super kick from the touchline, but the
Border cheering had hardly subsided when West leapt ahead again. The Jed
defence was caught on the hop and West, having first probed to the
right, swung the ball back across field and fullback Alan Williamson
dipped in at the corner flag for an unconverted try just on the
half-time whistle.
West persisted in overdoing the up-and-unders, but territorially
deserved to increase their lead with the final score of the day after 53
minutes. Fly-half Gregor McKechnie tried to clear on his goal line but
the ever-vigilant Fraser Stott leapt to charge the kick and touch down.
So West collected two valuable points, but the battle for survival
continues.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M J A Craig, D R McKee, C Hart, S
Munro; D N Barrett, F H Stott; I A Cochrane, G C Bulloch, A S Crear, S
Campbell, G C Perrett, D A McVey, D McLeish, J Lonergan. Replacement --

Stewart's Melville FP 16, Watsonians 28
WATSONIANS coach Peter Gallagher began this game with somewhat modest
ambitions. ''I felt if we could take two points we would have guaranteed
our place in the re-formed first division next season.''
When the news eventually filtered through from downtown Hawick on the
demise of Stirling County, his perceptions changed. ''Now I never ruled
out us winning the championship. Only two points in it -- they will all
be crunch matches in the run-in.''
I was also reminded that some brave bookmaker -- yes, they do exist --
had offered Watsonians for the title at 300-1 and that everyone remotely
connected with the club appears to have had a Lady Godiva on it. Bet the
last league game against Dundee High School FP is a cracker.
Stewart's Melville are forced to have more realistic goals. As the
club programme stated: ''We could win our last five league games, but
there is probably more chance of John Major winning the next election!''
Very droll, I must say.
Yet, midway through the second half, when the home team had clawed
back to 16-all and a former British Lions captain was patrolling the
touchline like a barking Rottweiler, there seemed to be just a chance.
Finlay Calder, for it was he, told me afterwards: ''We lack a bit of
poise but they are great youngsters giving their all for the club. This
team manager's job is 10 times worse than playing.''
Everyone was having a gaze at Scott Hastings, back after injury and
having lost his Scotland place. He looked a bit ring-rusty, spilled a
couple of passes, but generally gave a creditable performance.
I spoke to him at the end and no-one should doubt his determination to
add to his cap total. But, on the day, he had to concede star billing to
big brother Gavin.
''He was immense,'' commented Calder, ''I just wish this club had
someone remotely as good as him.''
The senior Hastings punted from one end of the field to the other, was
an eager participant in every handling move, and kicked his goals
majestically. Quite enjoyed that, I ventured? ''Eventually,'' he
replied.
To referee Eddie Murray should also go some praise for what was a most
attractive match. The home right wing Nick Penny is one who could go
places fast and Graeme Burns confirmed we have an awful lot of talented
scrum-halves.
Gavin and Phil Hodgson exchanged penalties before a Duncan Hodge
break, the first of several, created a try for John Kerr, Scott Hastings
supplying the scoring pass.
The conversion by Gavin was followed by another penalty by the
Scotland skipper and a second for Hodgson.
After the oranges, Gavin banged over a big one but Stew Mel came
roaring back. Prop Alan Kittle popped up in the back line, shrugged off
defenders and swallow-dived over. Hodgson converted then kicked an
equalising goal.
Watsonians awoke, a sweeping handling move climaxed with Gavin sending
Kerr in for his second try. Finally Hodge shot through for a
well-deserved try and the big man converted. Bring on the Canadians.

THE drain of talent from Scottish clubs to their English counterparts,
who have the money and the jobs to offer them potential career paths,
will be, without question, one of the greatest challenges to face
Scottish rugby over the coming decade.
It has prompted Peter Dods, the Gala coach, to call for the SRU to get
a grip on things and try to keep players in Scotland.
From Dods' club Gala, Gregor Townsend has signed papers for
Northampton and London Scottish, while Michael Dods has put pen to paper
with West Hartlepool and Chris Dalgliesh has signed for London Scottish.
Shade Munro from GHK has also been approached by London Scottish.
Martin Scott has already left for Orrell, finding himself sent off in
his first league game, Rob Wainwright left Edinburgh Accies for West
Hartlepool -- as did Derrick Paterson -- and Andy Nicol left last week
for Bath.
All of which has amounted to a brawn drain the like of which we barely
glimpsed before when Gavin Hastings went south, as did Derek White, and
Craig Chalmers and Graham Shiel very nearly did.
Iain McGeechan, who approached Gala about Gregor Townsend, is known to
believe that England has limited appeal to players, many of whom, like
Gavin Hastings, return to Scotland eventually. Not everyone wants to
live in England after all, and the English clubs know it is the likes of
Townsend and Munro, both still young, who are more willing to move down
to get on a jobs ladder that may not exist up here.
Gala approached the SRU about whether they could refuse to sign the
papers sent up by Northampton. ''We were told by the SRU that we should
sign them. They likened it to an Edinburgh club asking a regional player
to join, and we discussed Gregor's case, but we cannot stop someone from
getting a good job,'' says Alister Patullo, the Gala secretary.
''But we resent these English clubs coming here to poach our players.
Employment prospects in Galashiels, with a population of 13,000, are
poor. We have a New Zealander playing for us, but these jobs involve
labouring or such like. Gregor, who will have a degree in politics, is
above that.''
Peter Dods has threatened to resign if Townsend leaves.
''If one or two of these players went, then what would be the point in
me keeping coaching?'' he asks.
''The SRU wrote a letter to the players at the start of the season
saying that they should stay in Scotland. Now five of the national team
are from down south.
''I think the SRU should make the players sign contracts to stay up
here. Besides, the players have an agent through the SRU. What are they
doing to find players jobs?''
After all, New Zealand have signed their top 60 players to contracts
binding them to New Zealand rugby.
Perhaps the most strident attempts to keep players have come from GHK.
''We regard Shade Munro as a key component of this club's future, and
we have already taken steps to assist him in securing a career for life.
That's what is important, not just a job.''
Says GHK President Ian Litster: ''To help Shade we have used a
recruitment resource to help him in career counselling.''
The resource in question is John Murphy, a human resource consultant
and GHK member. ''It is worth remembering only one job in seven is
advertised, the rest come through contacts or chance,'' he says.
''We have to make sure he secures a career opportunity. People often
look at big name rugby players and assume it is an easy task for them to
generate contacts and jobs, and that is not really the case.''
Litster was clear in his mind as to the threat posed by English clubs.
''It is without question a huge problem for the Scottish game. We have
to try to keep our players in this country.''
West of Scotland secretary Hugh Barrow said: ''We can see the problem
developing, it will get worse, but we do what we can.''
I agree with the clubs. We must keep our best players here. Come on
SRU, catch a grip and stop the drain.

GHK 20, Edinburgh Academicals 25
FOR some curious reason, one GHK worthy thought before this game that
the points were in the bag.
The chaps from the East had altogether different ideas and, in what
turned out to be something of a game of one half, they ground down and
finally overcame their hosts.
Not just that GHK worthy was downcast after the game as the
Academicals celebrated. The whole Old Anniesland clubhouse was a bit
subdued.
Players and supporters alike knew that the Glasgow side had failed to
take chances and to use the elements effectively in the first half.
George Breckenridge seemed ill at ease in the full back role and one
was left pondering the wisdom of putting him there, with Steve Hirini
hardly setting the heather on fire at stand-off.
Despite the presence of international forwards such as Jeremy
Richardson, Shade Munro, and Alan Watt, the lineout was a shambles, but
the back row battle was interesting, with McIvor, Waite and Hoole just
edging the Wallace brothers and Walter Malcolm.
Despite the plethora of tries in the first half it was left to the
kickers to sort things out.
Breckenridge opened GHK's account with a first-minute penalty goal, to
which the determined Hoole responded with a try from good scrummage
ball.
It was a joy to see the wingers in the action and Graham Agnew was
first on the scoresheet with a pacy run from Gordon McIlwham's fine pick
up and pass.
Chris Newton's try was cancelled out by a cracker from Gerry Hawkes,
fed at pace by Ian McDiarmid's long pass, to which Breckenridge added
goal points.
Two penalty goals from Rowen Shepherd kept Accies in touch after
Hawkes had grabbed an opportunist try, kicking ahead and just beating
Burns to the touch.
Brian Hay-Smith nibbled at the home lead with a drop goal before two
Shepherd penalty goals gave the visitors victory.
GHK are in a slump from which they must emerge quickly if they are to
build on good early-season work. Accies have grabbed a Division One
lifeline which, with this level of commitment, they do not look like
letting go easily.
GHK -- G M Breckenridge; G S Agnew, A C Glasgow, I F McDiarmid, G F

Boroughmuir 53, Melrose 29
THE equation is simple. Eight tries against Melrose, courtesy of an
outstanding performance by the pack, plus Stirling's slip at Mansfield
Park equals a born-again championship campaign for Boroughmuir.
Meggetland coach Henry Edwards summed it up thus: ''We're back in the
hunt and it's still all to play for. It wasn't perfect and we had one or
two lapses, but we played well right from the start. The spirit has been
good all week and we really wanted to win this one.''
Defending champions Melrose came to Edinburgh on Saturday in third
place with the 1991 champions 'Muir one rung down the ladder. Melrose
now slip to fifth place and 'Muir occupy third slot behind Stirling and
Watsonians.
Stirling are still in the driving seat but after their defeat at
Mansfield Park, 'Sonians, 'Muir, and Heriot's are, in descending order
of likelihood, contenders once again.
Saturday's Meggetland clash should have seen Melrose and 'Muir
battling out a close encounter. But, more than anything, the hefty
scoreline in Boroughmuir's favour flattered the visitors.
Gary Parker's four penalty goals had the effect of distorting the true
nature of Boroughmuir's domination.
The home side were much sharper and positively hungered for victory, a
point conceded by Melrose coach Rob Moffat. ''Boroughmuir were up for it
and we were well beaten.''
Melrose scrum half Bryan Redpath, who is on Scotland duty against
Canada on Saturday, was more direct: ''We were left chasing the game
right from the start. In the first half we lost the ball nine times in
the tackle. We made it difficult for ourselves.''
Of the others who will be on parade for the national side on Saturday,
Peter Wright was the most impressive
Wright was in his rampaging element, beetling along with ball in hand
and playing Boroughmuir's mini-ruck, short-yardage game to perfection.
He had a try to himself plus a hand in another and had good reason to be
satisfied with his afternoon's work.
He played with eight stitches in a week-old cut above the left eye and
said later: ''I had no intention of missing this one.
''Apart from a 10-minute spell in the second half when we let things
slip, that was about as good a performance as I've seen from a
Boroughmuir pack.''
That 10-minute spell was an irritating fly in the Boroughmuir
ointment. Melrose, who had been kept in the game by the boot of Parker,
were allowed to claw back 17 points from a 39-12 deficit, by which time
it was too close for Boroughmuir comfort. The Meggetland mallet came
down again, though, allowing the home side to steam to the finish.
Scotland's half-back partnership, Chalmers and Redpath, operated on
meagre rations behind a beaten pack. But where they did impress was in
their refusal to accept that it was to be 'Muir's day. If there are dead
horses to be flogged then that pair will be at the head of the queue.
Stuart Reid, at No.8 for Boroughmuir, gladdened the hearts of those
who say that he should be the recipient of further Scotland honours by
playing a stormer, aided and abetted by Graham Drummond, a flanker
blessed with the self-belief that a 50-50 ball will always go his way.
Doddie Weir, despite two tries and a priceless tackle from behind on
an escaping Derek Stark, was still short of the standards he set himself
earlier in his young rugby life, but his day will surely come again.
Boroughmuir led 15-9 at the interval but, more worryingly for them,
trailed Melrose 13-2 on the penalty count. First half tries came from
Wright and Stark. Bryan Easson had a penalty goal and a conversion. For
Melrose, Parker kicked three penalty goals.
After the interval, Boroughmuir's points came from tries by Darren
Burns (3) -- his hat trick proving once again the truth of the old adage
that there's nothing better than being in the right place at the right
time -- Paul Jennings, Iwan Tukalo, and Mike Hall. Easson had a further
four conversions.
For Melrose, the points came from tries by Weir (2) and Ross Brown.
Parker had a single conversion and a penalty goal to his name.
Boroughmuir -- N Mardon; D Stark, S Lineen, D Laird, I Tukalo; B
Easson, M Hall; G Wilson, N Dickson, P Wright, P Jennings, D Burns, G
Drummond, S Reid, C Macfarlane.
Melrose -- D Bain; C Joiner, R Brown, G Shiel, G Parker; C Chalmers, B
Redpath; I Cornwall, S Scott, D Lunn, M Runciman, R Brown, A Kerr, G
Weir, S Aitken. Replacement -- D Graham for Scott (56 minutes).
Referee -- G Gadjovich (Canada).

A LABOUR MP claimed yesterday that British Gas, which has been
severely criticised in recent weeks, is set to lose its Charter Mark
because of a decline in services.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Shadow Consumer Minister and MP for Edinburgh
South, said the Gas Consumers Council was meeting this week to consider
the Mark.
Information passed to him, he said, indicated the likely loss of the
Mark, awarded to the company for high levels of service.
''I'm not suprised to learn it no longer appears to meet the
criteria,'' Mr Griffiths said.
He said in the past three months there had been a 25% rise in
complaints to regional consumer councils, the closure of more than 200
showrooms, the axing of services in those left, and ''a series of gas
explosions from Inverness to the South of England.''
Earlier this month an investigation was launched by Health and Safety
Executive officials into a gas explosion in an Inverness house. During
the inquiry a leak was discovered in the gas meter.
British Gas, which last month confirmed it was to cut drastically the
amount it spends on checking gas leaks, pursued its own inquiry into
claims that a leak had been reported 16 hours before the explosion.
Mr Griffiths said thatwhen the Mark was awarded Britsh Gas had twice
the number of showrooms giving four times the number of services.
He recently tabled questions in Parliament about cases in the South of
England involving a 94-year-old registered blind woman left with no
kitchen water heater for 18 days and two pensioners left without central
heating for two months.
Mr Griffiths has asked Mr Michael Heseltine, the Board of Trade
President, to intervene to persuade British Gas to restore services.
A spokesman for British Gas in Scotland last night could not comment
in detail until hearing what the GCC had to say.''British Gas is going
through a major reorganisation at the moment but the company remains
totally committed to safety and the well-being of its customers.''

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of infected blood donations have been given to patients
despite the ready availability of a test for the hepatitis C virus, it
is claimed today.
The Blood Transfusion Service failed to check for the virus -- which
can cause serious liver disease and cancer -- for two years between 1989
and 1991, according to a BBC1 Panorama programme to be broadcast
tonight.
About 3600 bags of infected blood were used during this time, the
programme says.
The disclosure comes less than one week after the Government announced
that people who received donated blood before September 1991 and might
be infected with the virus were to be tracked down and, if necessary,
treated.
Since September 1991, all donated blood has been routinely tested for
antibodies to the virus.
According to Panorama, the first test for hepatitis C was available
six years ago and was used widely in other countries.
But for nearly two years the 2.5 million bags of blood donated in
Britain every year were not tested.
A study at the North London Transfusion Centre showed one in 1300
donors could pass on the hepatitis C virus -- which works out as about
35 donors a week throughout Britain.
Dr John Barbara, a consultant at the National Blood Authority, says
the size of the screening programme discouraged him.

<TEXT>
POLICE in four counties yesterday carried out dawn raids on a firm of
solicitors which claims to be the country's biggest criminal law
practice.
Scores of plain-clothes and uniformed officers took part in the
operation, which was run by the Serious Fraud Office in London.
The firm at the centre of the raids is Robinson's, which is based in
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The investigation is understood to be in
connection with alleged Legal Aid ''irregularities''.
Police arrived at the home of Mr Timothy Robinson, law firm principal,
at the Old Vicarage, Badgeworth, near Cheltenham, shortly before 8am.
Officers launched searches at Mr Robinson's offices in Barton Street,
Gloucester, and Hesters Way, Cheltenham, and at other offices in
Gloucestershire, Avon, Somerset, and Wiltshire.
Gloucestershire Police refused to comment on the operation and
referred all inquiries to the SFO in London.
The SFO said in a statement: ''The Serious Fraud Office, with
constabularies in Gloucestershire, Avon, Somerset, and Wiltshire, today
executed warrants to search a number of office and residential premises
in connection with an on-going investigation into alleged fraud.
''The investigation is continuing and it is therefore inappropriate to
comment further at this stage.''
Mr Robinson said yesterday the raids might have been caused by
allegations from a sacked former employee. The firm was ''co-operating
fully'' with the investigation.
''I support efforts being made by the authorities to prevent abuse of
the Legal Aid fund,'' he said.
''It is possible the investigation has arisen as a result of malicious
allegations made by a former employee who was dismissed by this firm for
this type of fraud.
''While this has all the hallmarks of a fishing expedition, we have
total confidence that the firm will be given a clean bill of health.''
Mr Robinson, who in 1992 launched a scathing attack on legal system
reform plans by the Lord Chancellor, said he had not been questioned and
police confined themselves to searching for documents. They also called
on the homes of some, but not all, of his three partners.

THE Prime Minister's authority in the House of Commons was facing a
new danger last night when the Ulster Unionists threatened to withdraw
support from the Government.
Their anger was provoked by a newspaper article suggesting that
Ministers are about to agree to the establishment of cross-border
institutions in Ireland.
The Unionists fear that the British and Irish governments are close to
a compromise on powerful committees, controlling such areas as tourism,
farming and fisheries.
They would be set up, before any elections to a new Stormont assembly,
as part of the joint framework for the Northern Ireland peace process.
Mr Major is, technically, operating without a Commons majority after
the removal of the party whip from nine Tory Euro-rebels, and relies
heavily on voting support from the Unionists.
Their withdrawal could, ultimately, lead to a General Election. The
importance of their position was illustrated in last month's defeat for
the Government's plan to raise VAT on fuel, when the Unionists, along
with some Tory rebels, opposed the measure.
Mr David Trimble, the Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said that he and his
colleagues were concerned by a story in a Sunday newspaper yesterday,
which appeared to be based on a briefing from an official at the
Northern Ireland Office.
''According to that briefing, the Government is considering setting up
a range of cross-border institutions, all-Ireland institutions with
executive powers, and legislating for them at Westminster over our heads
and compelling any members of a Northern Ireland assembly to take part
in this, whether they like it or not.
''We have made it absolutely clear to the Government that that is
something that we could not tolerate. I don't think we can give any
countenance to a framework document along those lines.''
Mr Trimble told BBC Radio: ''We have said that we'll sustain the
Government so long as they are acting in the best interests of the UK
and Northern Ireland.
''A framework document along those lines would threaten the existence
of the UK, and it would certainly be hostile to the future and best
interests of Northern Ireland.
''It would, in that situation, be impossible for us to sustain support
for the Government.''
Another MP, Mr John Taylor, warned that Unionists would react in the
same way as they did in 1974, when London accepted proposals for an
all-Ireland council.
''Let the Tory Government be left in no doubt that now, just as then,
we will be absolutely opposed to any suggestion of all-Ireland bodies
with executive powers. Such a proposal would ensure that every Unionist
worth his salt would unite to oppose the Government,'' said Mr Taylor.
The first warning shots in the Unionist campaign are expected to be
fired this week, with Unionist MPs refusing to side with the Government
during a fisheries debate, when the issue of Spanish and Portuguese
boats operating in British waters will be at stake.
Historically, the Tories have been more sympathetic to the Unionists'
cause than Labour, but Mr Trimble indicated yesterday that his party
could live with a Labour government.
''In the last few months, the policy of the Labour Party seems to be
evolving and they are probably evolving towards the mode they will adopt
when they are in government.''
A Labour government was ''not a prospect I would instinctively recoil
from,'' he said.
Meanwhile, leading Cabinet Euro-sceptic Michael Portillo yesterday
signalled a possible end to recent turmoil by insisting ''conditions are
now in place'' for the Tory party to re-unite and take the rebels back
on board.
He spelled out British plans aimed at reducing the power of Brussels,
hours before the executive of the 1922 Committee was being lunched by Mr
Major at Chequers -- a move widely interpreted as a charm offensive to
woo back the disaffected Tory right.
The Prime Minister is believed to be intending to go to preliminary
inter-governmental talks in June with a batch of proposals aimed at
resisting constitutional change, as well as appealing to the
Euro-sceptic Tory wing.
* Sinn Fein representatives and senior civil servants are set for a
crucial meeting at Stormont today.
It will be the third time the two sides have got together since the
IRA ceasefire, and Government pressure on the Provisionals to make some
sort of move towards the decommissioning of weapons is likely to
intensify.
Sinn Fein claims the issue cannot be resolved at preliminary talks
with civil servants, and can only be sorted out as part of an overall
agreement with Ministers.
However, Ulster Unionist MP the Rev Martin Smyth said the IRA would
have to make some sort of gesture.

THE Belfast Shuffle, a 25-year-old dance step designed to cheat death
from sniper fire, ended at dusk yesterday as British troops were pulled
back to barracks in the city for the foreseeable future.
The streets were quiet as men of the Parachute Regiment and the King's
Royal Hussars became the last soldiers to play a visible role in
daylight in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Although there are no immediate plans to withdraw battalions from
Northern Ireland, the Army has now handed over daytime control of
security in Belfast to the police for as long as peace reigns in the
province.
The Shuffle originated in the city hotspot patrol areas of the Falls
Road, the Ballymurphy, Turf Lodge, Whiterock, and Riverdale in the early
1970s as squaddies learned the hard way that moving in straight lines in
hostile areas could be a shortcut to wounds or death.
A generation of young soldiers who received their military
''blooding'' in the city was taught the art of tactical patrolling, a
technique which involved varying the rhythm and pace of their movements
to throw off the aim of sharpshooters in Republican backstreets.
The tail-end-Charlie in any patrol would walk backwards for three or
four steps and then bob to one side or the other and walk straight ahead
before starting the process all over again.
His comrades ahead of him would be doing much the same in Belfast's
own grotesque version of formation survival dancing.
The technique quickly became second nature, and enjoyed a brief period
of fame in mainland UK discos as soldiers back from four-month emergency
tours in the province strutted their novel stuff to relieve the tension
of 18-hour days, cramped living conditions and constant danger.
The West Belfast MP, Dr Joe Hendron, last night welcomed the move as a
historic milestone in the city's 25-year catalogue of murder and
violence.
''This will be a magnificent experience for young and old who cannot
remember a time without troops on the streets. It is a momentous day
which renews our hope of a future free of violence,'' he said.
Soldiers based at Springfield Road barracks, only a few yards from the
IRA heartland of the Falls, also welcomed the ending of daylight
patrols. Most said they hoped the peace process would continue, and that
they would never again have to risk their lives to minimise sectarian
violence.
Londonderry, the province's other main city, has already handed over
responsibility for law and order to the RUC. But a pronounced military
presence remains in the ''bandit country'' rural areas of South Armagh
and East Tyrone.
It is unlikely this will be scaled down until a deal is struck with
the paramilitary forces of both loyalist and republican groups to hand
over the bulk of their considerable arsenals of modern weapons and
explosives.
In some areas, this could continue to pose a problem. An officer based
in Tyrone said last night: ''The people living in the western hills
along the Tyrone and Fermanagh borders with the Republic have always
been a tough breed with scant regard for the law. Stagecoaches passing
through the area in the 1700s had to have an escort of cavalry to ensure
safe passage.
''In some ways, nothing changes. That was 200 years before the advent
of the IRA. A spirit of lawlessness remains which may have little
connection with republicanism or the Provisionals.''
There are currently more than 18,000 troops in Northern Ireland. With
the ending of a daylight routine which took up more than half of their
duty time, the Army will now have to find other ways of occupying them.
An Army source said yesterday: ''The way is obviously open for at
least partial withdrawal from the province within a fairly short
time-scale.''
A shopkeeper on the Falls Road said: ''It's going to be difficult to
imagine life around here without Brit squaddies. I'm not in the least
sorry about their going. But things are getting better. We can just keep
our fingers crossed.''

OPPORTUNITY 2000, a campaign launched more than three years ago with
the aim of improving the quantity and quality of women in employment, is
to relaunch in Scotland, where progress has proved disappointing.
Growing membership south of the Border saw a relative surge to 277
concerns over the past year, whereas Scottish membership remains at a
mere handful, resulting in such comments as ''Scottish business is run
by a male mafia'', and that Scottish businessmen are ''fairly
misogynistic''.
Opportunity 2000's campaigns director, Ms Pat Corcoran, dissociates
herself from such views, and is confident of a far greater take-up once
Scottish businesses are made more aware of the issues.
She does, however, concede that there is ''a strong resistance in
Scotland to the idea that women have a right to be in the workplace'',
and that many Scotsmen feel that a woman's place is in the home.
Experience in Northern Ireland, where progess was also slow, had shown
that, once under local management, Opportunity 2000 made steady but not
swift progress.
The aim now was to try to interest senior directors of a few leading
Scottish companies to spearhead an awareness campaign. A public
relations firm, Charles Barker, is being brought in to help.
The initiative, launched in October 1991, has proved successful. In
member companies, women fill 25% of management posts compared to an
average of 10% in non-member companies.
But that success is qualified when one remembers that 277 companies
represent a very small slice of British business, and that those that
who join tend to be concerns with disproportionate numbers of female
employees, and therefore already with a greater awareness.
Traditionally male-dominated areas continue to be slow to change, with
just three of the 43 regional police forces joining up.
Opportunity 2000 began with 61 members in 1991. Membership increased
to 188 in 1993, and 277 at the end of last year. A growing number of
universities and local authorities are now signing up -- but not so far
in Scotland.
The few Scottish members of Opportunity 2000 include the Scottish
Office, Scottish Enterprise, the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank of
Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, the Health Education Board for Scotland, and
Kwik-Fit Holdings.

<TEXT>
THE new Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Edinburgh University has
accused the Government of a marked tendency to compare universities to
''production lines''.
Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland warns in his annual report that it
will be difficult to maintain standards across the higher education
system if the Government continues annual cuts in recurrent funding per
student.
''It is illusory to pretend that annual progressive 'efficiency gains'
-- which have been at the core of Government university funding policy
for the last 10 years -- can continue indefinitely at 2% or more a year
without affecting quality and productivity across the system as a
whole.''
Sir Stewart, knighted in the New Year Honours List, says universities
have an obligation to operate efficiently and entrepreneurially.
Edinburgh was doing just that, and generating extra income. However
this assumed a base of adequate public funding. ''To imperil the latter
is to put at risk the former.''
He maintained that, in an increasingly diverse system of higher
education, it remained vital that excellence to international standards
should continue to be the aspiration of all.

#16.3m lottery
bonanza, but
no millionaires
A RECORD breaking lottery produced 133 jackpot winners at the weekend,
but no millionaires.
Sharing out the top prize between so many meant that no-one won more
than #122,510, despite a ''roll-over'' jackpot of #16,293,830.
Ticket sales were up 21% on the previous week to total #69.8m, #18m of
which is destined for charities.
Because of the large number of players tempted by the prospect of a
big jackpot -- forecasts over-estimated the figure at more than #19m --
there were more than two million winners.
A total of 246 people each won #7872 by matching five balls plus the
bonus ball, and more than 6000 got a #181 share of the #1,205,460 third
prize.
Almost 166,000 people won #16 and nearly two million won #10. In all
there were 2,105,521 winners who share #41,415,050 in prize money.
The winning numbers were 23, 38, 17, 7, 32 and 42. The bonus number
was 48.
Officials of the organiser, Camelot, were surprised that more than 100
people had chosen the jackpot numbers.
Communications director David Rigg said: ''This is an amazing result
which highlights the random nature of the national lottery. The numbers
chosen must be specially significant to lots of people.''
Statistically, not more than three or four people in the country would
be expected to pick all six winning numbers.
A Camelot spokeswoman said many people considered seven a lucky
number, which made it popular. So was 42, since it is divisible by
seven.
''It's a phenomenal result, but it really is just down to random
chance,'' she said. ''Next week it could be that just one person wins
the jackpot.''
Last month's #17.8m top prize, landed by a Blackburn man, led to
widespead condemnation from church leaders and politicians over the
morality of the lottery.
Church of England leaders launched a fresh attack on the lottery this
week. The House of Bishops called it was ''a form of nationally
sponsored gambling designed to encourage false hopes and
over-indulgence''.
It was reported yesterday that a Labour government would limit
individual wins to #5m to guarantee that more people would become
millionaires.
The Sunday Telegraph said that Labour's National Heritage spokesman,
Mr Chris Smith, had promised to cap the jackpot and share the remaining
float among runners-up.
''I want to see a lottery which allows people to have substantial
wins, but not ones which most people think are unreasonable. That is
what these measures would achieve,'' he was quoted as saying.
The top prize for this week is estimated at #7m. Last week's jackpot
was topped up by the previous Saturday's unclaimed #10m ''Superdraw''
prize.

<TEXT>
A FARMER is set to sue the Scottish Secretary in one of the biggest
civil actions to be raised in a sheriff court.
Mr Jimmy Wilson, of Carmyle Farm, Carmyle, Glasgow, and his lawyers
will today put the finishing touches to a #12.9m claim.
It is expected that the action will be lodged at Glasgow Sheriff Court
later this week.
His argument with officialdom has already led him to take two horses
into a court; drive a horse and cart along a motorway; and threaten to
erect a toll gate across the M74 and charge police a half guinea to use
it.
The row with the Scottish Office stems from its compulsorily takeover
of four acres of his land to build a new section of the M74.
The 52-year-old former carter and scrap merchant, now a millionaire,
claims he received no compensation for his land.
He also alleges that 80,000 tons of valuable sandstone which he had
stockpiled on his land was used without his knowledge or permission to
stabilise part of the road.
Mr Wilson built up a huge stockpile of sandstone when Glasgow's
tenements were being demolished.
He said yesterday: ''The district council and Scottish Homes have
plans to spend #1500m in regenerating gap sites in the city with
sandstone buildings. This makes the stone I have a very valuable
resource and I intend suing the Secretary of State for the value of the
material which went missing from my property.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''There is no dispute over the
quantity of material taken away. The dispute is over the make-up of the
material.
''We have prepared an agreement and Mr Wilson has been asked to sign
it before we can get a mineral valuer in to determine what was on the
land. The outcome of that will determine what level of compensation is
applicable.''

AN AYRSHIRE householder has accused Prestwick International Airport of
''unbelievable arrogance'' over its plans to build a 900-space car park

Mr Scott Shepherd, who works as an air traffic controller covering
both Prestwick and Glasgow Airports, yesterday claimed the new
development would replace views of Arran with an ocean of cars, and
would result in a considerable reduction in the value of his #136,000
property.
PIK Ltd, the private company which runs the Ayrshire airport,
submitted planning applications to Kyle and Carrick District Council for
the car park, together with a access-improving roundabout on the A79,
just before Christmas.
Mr Shepherd and three neighbours immediately submitted objections to
the district council and were angered, Mr Shepherd claimed, by an
assumption they detected on the part of the company that the work would
go ahead regardless of their comments.
''Prestwick are being unbelievably arrogant about this,'' Mr Shepherd
said. ''They're already boasting about their new facilities in their
publicity materials, as if anything we say will be totally ignored, even
though this is a green belt area.
''We all want the airport to be successful, but this development will
seriously affect my family's life. The floodlights will be on all night,
and we're bound to be woken up at night by the sound of cars being
started.''
Mr Shepherd has already contacted his district and regional
councillors, and is due to meet with Ayr MP Phil Gallie later this week
to discuss his concerns.
Mr Matthew Hudson, chief executive of PIK Ltd, said the extra parking,
which would bring the number of spaces available to 1650, was needed to
accommodate the anticipated doubling in passenger numbers travelling
from the airport this year.
Mr Hudson maintained the company would landscape the car park,
screening it from Mr Shepherd's view with a stand of trees, and claimed
it would be a great improvement on the current site, owned by the
airport, which he described as a complete tip.
He offered to arrange meetings with PIK staff for anyone concerned
about the effects of the development, but continued to insist that the
car park would be in place by May to handle holiday departures.
Kyle and Carrick councillors were unlikely, though, to discuss the
airport's planning application till the end of February, a council
spokesman confirmed to The Herald.
''We are at a very early stage in assessing this application, and our
investigation is likely to be complicated by the fact this development
is on land protected by the green belt policy.''
The spokesman could not give any further definite indication as to
when the application would be discussed.
