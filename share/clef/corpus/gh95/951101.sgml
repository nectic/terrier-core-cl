A COUPLE'S wedding party -- and their marriage -- broke up within
hours of taking their vows.
The bride, groom, and best man spent what should have been the
honeymoon night in the police cells in Oban after a punch-up at the
reception.
Glaswegians Elizabeth Morris and Charles Miller brought 16 guests from
the city to watch them tie the knot.
However, it all ended in tears when a free-for-all broke out on the
fourth floor of the Regent Hotel.
Assistant manageress Julie Thomson told Oban Sheriff Court: ''Everyone
was fighting. There was blood running everywhere. You didn't know who
the blood was coming from.''
She came across the scene after the guests had gone to bed with
carry-outs around midnight and she heard a rumpus from two floors
further down.
Miller, of Snaefell Avenue, Burnside, and best man Joseph Kennedy, of
87 James Nisbett Street, Royston, both Glasgow, were charged with breach
of the peace.
They denied the charge and were found not guilty when the trial was
halted after Miss Thomson's evidence.
She said there were so many of the guests in the melee she was unable
to say who was attacking and who was trying to stop the brawl.
Bride Elizabeth, a 40-year-old taxi driver, of Simpson Street,
Maryhill, tried to intervene when her husband was arrested and was
charged with breach of the peace which she admitted in court. She was
admonished.
The court heard that the couple have been separated since the day of
the wedding.

<HEADLINE>Gascoigne says that Rangers are ready for their Italian job. Pride is the key at Ibrox</HEADLINE>

RANGERS, if they are to revive their Champions' League ambitions, must
not lose again to Juventus, but as preparations for tonight's match at
Ibrox were being finalised, it emerged that pride was the true
motivation for the premier division champions.
Every player, even those who did not play in Turin, are fired by a
fierce determination to retrieve the club's credibility.
Paul Gascoigne, one of those who could do no more than squirm as
Juventus thrashed Rangers 4-0 two weeks ago, is again fit, and he
stressed that he and the others ''owe the manager one.''
The English internationalist spoke yesterday with the passion we have
come to expect of him and which, unfortunately, can also drive him
headlong into trouble, but his message was clear. ''I wouldn't say we
have to draw, I think we have to win,'' he said.
''A win would mean everything to us and we'd still be in the
Champions' League. But it is not just about the points, it is about
pride. This match is for the gaffer.''
Walter Smith would have appreciated the sentiment because he, too, had
spoken about the need to restore battered pride after the horrors which
befell the side in the Stadio Delle Alpi.
The memories will be exorcised only by a victory, although most of
those connected with Rangers would probably be happy to settle for a
draw, and then attempt to gain maximum points from Steaua Bucharest at
Ibrox and Borussia Dortmund away.
The Italians, despite their recent results in domestic cup competition
and Serie A, are formidable, and Rangers cannot hope to match them in
skills and technique. They can, however, make up for deficiencies in
other ways.
''We have to match them in fitness and in hard work, and we've got to
play a bit also,'' said Gascoigne. ''We've got to be better than
Juventus in spirit''
With Stuart McCall, who has been able to train again after having
damaged his rib cage, almost certain to play in midfield beside
Gascoigne, Ian Ferguson, and Charlie Miller, Rangers will not be short
on determination, and the Italians will not find themselves gaining free
possession. Patience, as Smith pointed out, will not be a feature of
Rangers' play.
''That's not something which is part of the Scottish nature,'' he
said, ''and I don't think patience will play a significant part against
Juventus. Hopefully, our pride will be as great a motivation as anything
else.
''This will not be a night to concentrate on what they are going to
do, it will be a night for us to concentrate on what we are going to
do.''
In other words, Rangers will try to force the play and themselves on
their opponents, who have been shown to be vulnerable to determined
attacks, and the more Rangers can make Juventus feel their defence could
be breached, the less able they might be to ensure a steady supply to
Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli, and Alessandro Del Piero.
''Vialli, for me, is the one that makes them play,'' said Smith. ''Del
Piero takes the credit for pieces of brilliance, but Vialli is the one.
The most important thing is that we play this time.
''In Turin we just didn't have any possession and they scored three in
something like seven minutes. We didn't impose ourselves at any time and
were just like bit-part players.''
Rangers' impotency in Turin shocked Smith, who had thought that his
players would do more despite the injury problems whch caused
significant absences, but this is the big time and he is entitled to
expect his team, regardless of composition, to play some kind of part at
least.
That is where Gascoigne, in particular, must show himself to be the
footballer Smith believes he is, and tonight would be as good a time as
any to produce his best. A sparkling performance would convince his
doubters here and also show the Italians what they have allowed to move
on from their environment.
''I now that if I play badly I'll get slaughtered and I now also that
if I play well I'll be praised. It's always been like that for me,''
said the player who seems already to have formed his own opinion of the
Scottish game. ''Scottish football would not be Scottish football
without Rangers.''
There is truth in that, of course, and that is why it is important not
merely for Rangers' sake that Juventus are given a hard time tonight.
Our game is on trial this week and cannot take many more severe
beatings.
''The crowd could be important to us,'' Gascoigne added. ''They lifted
us in the second half against Dortmund and I'd never experienced
anything like that in 12 years.''

THE skies were grey, the clubs suits of Juventus were a match, and the
mood of the Italian champions also was ominous. Nothing personal, you
understand, just business.
Juventus believe they have a duty to produce their best after their
4-0 defeat by Lazio, and if his players respond in the manner expected,
manager Marcello Lippi believes ''they will win easily'' at Ibrox.
Lippi was explaining that his side usually come back strongly from set
backs, which was the case when they played Rangers for the first time in
Group C of the Champions' League. That match was played three days after
a 2-1 defeat by AC Milan in the San Siro, and Rangers were beaten 4-0
even though the Italian side were without Gianluca Vialli, who has
recovered from injury and will play tonight.
Vialli sat by Lippi's side yesterday and both were clad in the club's
uniform, although the striker and captain was excused his own little
excesses of white handkerchief which billowed from his breast pocket,
and also the black baseball cap perched on his shaven head. However,
there was another difference, but one about which Vialli was unaware.
His flies were undone.
Even the greats can be absent minded, but there are unlikely to be any
mistakes tonight when Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli, and Alessandro Del
Piero form the famed Juventus trident for only the second time in this
Champions' League series. They played against Steaua Bucharest in
September when Juventus won 3-0.
Juventus arrived in Glasgow without Attilio Lombardo, Vladimir
Jugovic, and Luca Fusi, and also Pietro Vierchowod, but Lipi has such an
array of rich talents that these absences are unlikely to make any
difference so far as Rangers are concerned.
''Of course it will be more difficult for us in Glasgow because for
Rangers, this game is all or nothing,'' said Lippi, ''but we played an
excellent first half in the first game against them and if we can do
that again I think we can win the game easily.''
Vialli, who remembers playing against Richard Gough in 1989 when Italy
played Scotland, feels Paul Gascoigne will make a difference, and
pointed out that the midfield player was unable to ''display all of his
talents in Italy because of injuries. I know, however, that he can be an
inspirational player.''

TOMMY Burns, the Celtic manager, will ask his players to use the
seemingly contrasting attitudes of passion and patience as they attempt
to wipe out the single-goal lead Paris St Germain will bring to Parkhead
tomorrow for the second-leg of their European Cup-winners' Cup tie.
Burns feels that the men he fields will need the passion which will
flow from the giant new stand to unsettle the Frenchmen, who will rely
on a passing game which Burns advocates for his team.
Patience will be required by a defence which must maintain discipline
even as the sell-out crowd roar every man forward into old-fashioned and
unbridled attack.
Burns believes that the Paris side will find Parkhead a more daunting
place than most other grounds in Europe. They have made much of the fact
that they have travelled to the Nou Camp in Barcelona and left savouring
victory.
But Burns said: ''I know what it can be like in the Nou Camp, but our
place can be very intimidating. In my view, it would be more
intimidating.
''That new stand seems to hang over the pitch and the fans are much
closer to the players than in the Nou Camp. The noise, too, will be
something else. There is a special fervour which surrounds Celtic Park
on European nights, and that will be there this week. We all know that.
''What we have to preach to the players is not to be carried away by
that. We have to maintain discipline and ensure that we don't give away
goals stupidly. They will look to catch us on the break, as most
continental teams do, and we have to guard against that.''
Yesterday Burns was able to name a powerful squad, with only midfield
player Phil O'Donnell being left at home while the squad finalise their
preparations at Seamill.
The 18 players who will travel to the club's traditional pre-match
head-quarters on the Ayrshire coast are Gordon Marshall, Pat Bonner,
Stewart Kerr, Rudi Vata, Tom Boyd, John Hughes, Tosh McKinlay, John
McQuilken, Paul McStay, Simon Donnelly, Peter Grant, John Collins, Brian
McLaughlin, Andreas Thom, Pierre van Hooydonk, Willie Falconer, Andy
Walker, and Chris Hay.
''There was no chance of Phil O'Donnell being ready,'' said Burns,
''so we have decided to leave him out of the squad. Simon Donnelly has
begun to recover from the virus which hit him for a couple of days, and
he will be training as usual with the rest of the players tomorrow.
Andreas Thom and John Collins will be OK and that is important for us in
a game where we are being asked to take on one of the top European
teams.''
Thom and captain Paul McStay were named by the manager as his key
players. ''Andreas is important for us at all times, but particularly
when it comes to a match such as this,'' he said. ''In Europe he has the
ability to hurt teams. He has that change of pace which can trouble any
defence. As for Paul, he has been playing superbly since returning from
injury. When he plays like this then there is no-one better.
''Then we have been fortunate enough to have Peter Grant and John
Collins who also have been outstanding for us this season.
''I know that we are going in the right direction and I think we
proved that point in Paris, now we have to do it again in front of our
home support.''
Paris St Germain will arrive in Glasgow at lunch time today.

EXCLUSIVE:
GARY Armstrong and Doddie Weir seem poised to sign for
Newcastle-Gosforth as the first major Scottish recruits to millionaire
Sir John Hall's new English superclub. I understand that the pair have
signed registration forms with the club which would permit them to turn
out for Newcastle early in the New Year if ongoing negotiations are
completed satisfactorily.
A news conference has been arranged in Newcastle today, when three new
signings are to be announced. One of these is the Leicester and England
wing Tony Underwood. Depending on how talks go between the Scotsmen and
the club, it may well be that Newcastle could be in a position to
announce they have completed a successful cross-Border raid.
Armstrong, the Jed-Forest, Scotland, and British Lions scrum half, is
fighting his way back to fitness after a serious knee injury and is
desperate to win back his place in the Scotland side.
As revealed in these columns last month, Armstrong turned down a
#200,000 deal to turn professional with rugby league side Carlisle four
years ago. However, the attraction for the 29-year-old scrum half was
that he could continue to live in his home town of Jedburgh. The same
attraction applies to Newcastle-Gosforth.
Weir, 25, who has played all of his senior rugby for Melrose since
leaving Stewart's-Melville College in Edinburgh, is thought to be keen
to take up a fresh challenge.
The injection of massive amounts of cash by Sir John into the
Newcastle-Gosforth operation, as part of his Newcastle Sporting Club
concept, has led to a period of unprecedented recruitment activity
throughout the UK game. Rob Andrew was recruited from Wasps on a
five-year contract worth #750,000.
Hall's five-year plan is to repeat his success with Newcastle FC and
to transform the struggling Tyneside rugby outfit into the biggest club
in Europe.

Munich
RAITH Rovers' first excursion into European football this season ended
in a 2-1 defeat in the Olympic Stadium of Munich last night, but they
only went out after they gave Bayern Munich a fright.
Their manager, Jimmy Nicholl, like all the Fife club's sympathisers in
the 27,000 crowd, thought that his team were going to achieve what had
seemed impossible.
''I thought the signs were there that something magical might be going
to happen. When Bayern missed a penalty and Scott Thomson had two great
saves, I thought it might be our night,'' he said, ''but we gave two
goals away at the critical stage after it had looked as if we had a good
chance of adding to our one-goal lead.''
Nicholl said that he had told the players at the interval that ''it
could really happen.'' He then said: ''Half-time was too short for them.
They were itching to get out for the second half, but we made errors and
paid for them.
''I am very proud of them, nevertheless, and it has been a great
experience for us to play in a stadium as marvellous as this, and the
night will live with the players for a long time.''
Nicholl did have one criticism of Bayern, saying that he did not think
their possession play late on (''they played with us'') was fair to his
team. ''But I wish Bayern all the best for the rest of the
competition,'' he added.
The Munich coach, Otto Rehhagel, said that he had been a bit nervous
when Rovers went a goal up. ''I have felt all along that our players
thought they had this game won before we started. There was a lack of
concentration, especially at the penalty we missed, and I had to remind
them at half-time what they were about. They played better in the second
half.''
Rehhagel admitted that Rovers had given his team problems in both
games and admired their tactical awareness. He also praised their fans,
saying: ''The difference in Scotland and here is that if they lose 2-0
or 3-0 at home they still get a cheer and are supported in the next
game, not so in Germany.''

'The BBC may believe their listeners live for Graham's every
description of a match, but why they should wish to be involved with
someone who disgraced his own game is beyond me'
Consider this. You are
charged and found guilty of misconduct in that you accepted
substantial financial ''gifts,'' and as a consequence you are dismissed
from your lucrative and high-profile job. Then, you are suspended from
earning a living in your chosen profession for a year.
Now, what would you do? How would you feel?
Provided you didn't die of embarrassment, the shame of it all, the
likelihood is that at least you would be determined to lie low for as
long as possible hoping the public would forget all about you, and your
greed.
The best you would be hoping for would be the dawning of a day when
you could go out to the shops again -- of course, you would have moved
as far away from your old home as possible -- without fingers being
jabbed in your direction. That would be enough for the likes of us.
But not George Graham, sacked by Arsenal and suspended from managing a
football club for having accepted payments of #145,000 and #285,000 from
the Norwegian football agent, Rune Hauge, who also was banned by FIFA.
The payments, according to the Premier League inquiry team, arose in
direct consequence of the purchase of two players, Pal Leadersen and
John Jensen, and although an attempt was made to say they were gifts,
Graham was left in disgrace.
However, Graham says in his book, ''The Glory and The Grief,'' that
some of the money given to him was for a part in Manchester United's
purchase of Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and Ukrainian winger
Andrei Kanchelskis. Somehow that doesn't make the Scot's behaviour any
more acceptable, at least not to my mind.
Yet here he is, all over the pages of a tabloid newspaper which is
serialising his book telling all. I wonder why. Could it be to explain
why he was driven to such foolish action, or to rake in more money?
Also, he is used by BBC Radio south of the Border as a football
analyst, an alliance which deserves to be scrutinised. The BBC may
believe their listeners live for Graham's every description of a match
or an incident, but why they should wish to be involved with someone who
disgraced his own game is beyond me.
Perhaps someone will correct me here if I am wrong, but we are talking
about a man who, by his own admission, succumbed to greed. The argument
that most of us would have been tempted is flimsy to say the least,
because Graham was, again by his own admission, on a good salary from
Arsenal and he already had a wonderful lifestyle. Also, it was not any
one of us who were offered his kind of ''gifts.'' He was, and he was
caught by the inquiry.
However, instead of striving to stay out of the public eye, Graham
talks to us on radio and hopes we buy copies of his book. Excuse my
ignorance, but I always thought this sort of thing was not supposed to
pay.
Frankly, I am sick of Graham's story. He tells it as though we are
supposed to feel sorry for him, that in some way he is the victim.
Graham is hardly that, even though in one way he seems to have been
singled out.
It is two years snce the Premiership vowed to investigate transfer
irregularities, yet only Graham has been brought to account for having
accepted what are known in the business as ''bungs.'' That is wrong when
the inquiry is said to have examined at least 30 transfer deals.
There should be little sympathy in a game which cannot afford people
like Graham, wonderful manager that he was, but if one took the money
then we can be sure others had their briefcases stuffed too. Graham, who
admits he was stupid and that if it was offered again he would say ''No,
no, no,'' was wrong, but one man should not take the rap for everyone.
This inquiry should delay no longer. If there are others, it is only
fair they also are dragged out into the open also.

CHALLENGE Cup finalists Dundee United and Stenhousemuir were on league
business last night to leave them free for their big game on Sunday at
McDiarmid Park.
And the Tayside men romped home by 3-0 at Tannadice against Clydebank
to go to the top of the first division, while Stenhousemuir eased into
third place in the second division after Adrian Sprott scored all four
goals in the 4-1 home win over second-placed Berwick Rangers.
At Tannadice, United poured forward, and only a fine display by
Bankies' keeper Gary Matthews kept the score down.
United clearly had been given a major boost in confidence from their
3-1 whipping of table-toppers Dunfermline at the weekend, and they were
in the mood to repeat their convincing performance when the Bankies
arrived on Tayside with a six-game unbeaten run intact.
Despite the heroics of Matthews, however, United had their
table-topping place secure within 31 minutes with goals from Robbie
Winters, Grant Johnson, and Andy McLaren.
Winters hit the first after 11 minutes. And 14 minutes later, after a
Gary McSwegan shot had been blocked by Matthews, Johnson stepped in to
slot home the rebound for United's second goal.
Five minutes later, McLaren jinked his way through the Bankies defence
to hammer the ball home from 15 yards.
The remainder of the night saw the pattern of play maintained,
although United's finishing slipped somewhat from grace in the face of
some stubborn and resolute defending by Clydebank.
Meanwhile, Stenhousemuir kept in touch near the top of the second
division with what was for them a vital win over second-top Berwick at
Ochilview.
They had the points tied up by the interval thanks to an Adrian Sprott
hat-trick, which included a penalty, and the 33-year-old went on to grab
his fourth in the second half, again from the spot.
The 33-year-old proved he has lost none of his zest for the game.
Berwick's goal came after 70 minutes when Willie Irvine's cross was
knocked home by Graeme Fraser.
* BARRY Lavety, who recently failed a club drug test, marked his
return to action for St Mirren last with a hat trick against Hamilton in
a Reserve League match, two of them from the penalty spot.
The striker was given a standing ovation by the fans when he was taken
off.
Manager Jimmy Bone said: ''What a comeback. It was great to seee him
knock in those goals.''
GORDON Dalziel is the new manager of Ayr United, and his former Ibrox
team-mate, Ally Dawson, will move to Somerset Park as his assistant.
* QUEEN'S Park, owners of Hampden, have been granted outline planning
permission by Glasgow City Council for the new South Stand, part of the
#67m redevelopment of Scotland's national stadium.

Bayern Munich 2, Raith Rovers 1
(Agg: 4-1
FOR eight, memorable, minutes Raith Rovers had a tantalising glimpse
of the most audacious triumph in the club's history, and no Scot who was
in the Olympic Stadium last night will ever forget it.
The Fife side led the might of Munich by a goal for eight minutes and
were within the one goal which would have had Bayern's multi-million
pound team quaking in their expensive Adidas boots.
A second score would have levelled this UEFA Cup tie at 2-2 on
aggregate, and it would have been fascinating to see how the Germans
would have coped with that scenario.
As it was, Danny Lennon's free-kick goal just before the interval was
cancelled out by Jurgen Klinsmann's strike soon after the break, before
the Germans erased their worries with a second goal, this time from
Markus Babbel.
However, the Kirkcaldy side can travel home today with their self
esteem intact, and their reputation a good deal higher than when they
first set out in the tournament in August.
They made it through two rounds and although inevitably going down to
Bayern, Jimmy Nicholl's men will have benefited enormously from the
experience.
They ended up well beaten by the Germans over two legs but when you
consider that Rovers were taking part in only their sixth European game
while Bayern were celebrating their 200th, you get an idea of the
massive gap in experience, not to mention wealth.
As well as consistent encouragement from the 1200 enthusiasts who had
travelled to Munich on a plane and a prayer, Rovers were made feel at
home by the presence of a pipe band, which even played in the heart of
the main stand at one point during the game. However, it turned out that
these braw lads were all German members of the Munich Claymore Pipes and
Drums. They blew a mean pipe, none the less.
Some of Raith's passing moves impressed the crowd and their opponents.
They were under the collar much of the time but handled most of the
raids in the first half well, although the Germans had given the
impression that they could step up the pace if they so desired.
One move through the middle of the Rovers defence was foiled by a good
interception from Thomson, who thus established his credentials quickly.
The Fife team did escape severe punishment twice when Bayern looked
sure to score, one of them being from the penalty spot. Before that
Herzog, who was much involved in the action at both ends, had shot
against Thomson and watched astonished as the ball bounced off David
Sinclair and then over.
Rovers could have no argument about the penalty either after Ronnie
Coyle brought Nerlinger down with a sliding tackle. Then came a real
surprise, an appalling effort from the spot by Papin, who blasted the
ball high over the bar.
Raith had one or two decent attacks before they produced a surprise
for their supporters by nearly taking the lead. Steve Crawford had a
darting run but, unfortunately, he let the ball slip over the bye-line
as he went to cross. However, the big moment was to come before
half-time after Herzog fouled Lennon about 25 yards out.
The former Hibs player hit the free kick himself and smacked it
powerfully. Poetic justice was done when it hit the head of Herzog and
was deflected past a baffled Kahn. That had the Fife fans in ecstasy and
led to the Munich supporters whistling and jeering their team from the
field at half-time.
The unfortunate Herzog was left out as Bayern came out for the second
half, determined to put an end to what had been an embarrassing opening
period. He was replaced by Witeczek, but the new man had to work hard
along with his mates to keep Raith under control.
The sixth minute of the half, however, was to prove vital as Bayern
equalised after an unfortunate error by Coyle. The defender slipped as
he collected the ball, Zickler was onto the ball in a flash, ran on, and
laid it ahead of Klinsmann, who does not miss from six yards.
The Scots did not give up the chase but it was now a forlorn exercise
and became even more so when Bayern scored again 12 minutes later,
Babbel doing the damage after a messy scramble caused by a Witeczek
corner.
Rovers had put on Ally Graham for Rougier and Dave Kirkwood for
Taylor, but there were a lot of weary players in Raith shirts by now.
They hung on, with the help of another substitute, Jim McInally who
came on for Coyle, despite some hairy moments in their goal area and
left the field to great cheers from their willing supporters who
enhanced their own reputation in the Olympic stadium.
BAYERN MUNICH -- Kahn, Babbel, Hamann, Strunz, Helmer, Nerlinger,
Zickler, Herzog, Papin, Sforza, Klinsmann. Substitutes -- Scheuer, Frey,
Witeczek, Born, Gerster.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Taylor, Broddle, Coyle, Dennis, Sinclair,
Rougier, Cameron, Crawford, Lennon, Dair. Substitutes -- Fridge, Graham,
McInally, McMillan, Kirkwood.
Referee -- V Melnichuk (Ukraine).

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
WHILE Rangers build up for their Group C clash against Juventus at
Ibrox tonight, Borussia Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld is sifting
through his playing staff trying to formulate an attack for the Germans'
group meeting with Steaua Bucharest in Romania.
Dortmund will almost certainly be without Heiko Herrlich because of an
injury, while Ibrahim Tanko is missing due to a stress fracture. But it
is not just a concern as to where the goals will come from, because a
broken hand also has ruled out defender Stefan Reuter.
However, on the plus side, Dortmund will have the influential Andreas
Moeller in the side.
Steaua will be without midfielder Damian Militaru, serving the third
and last game of a suspension.
Nothing less than success will do for Blackburn against Group B rivals
Legia Warsaw at Ewood Park, and Rovers captain Tim Sherwood is convinced
that the English champions will collect their first three points of the
tournament. ''It would be disastrous if we went through the whole
tournament without getting a point, but this is a great chance for us,''
he said.
''We thought we would have done better than we have but hopefully we
will get some pride back now. We never put the Poles under pressure out
there but I think you will see a different Blackburn side now.''
Real Madrid again face selection problems as they prepare for their
Group D match against Ferencvaros in Hungary. Coach Jorge Valdano's
difficulties mean Madrid, for whom Fernando Redondo is doubtful after
having a tooth removed, could struggle despite beating Ferencvaros
comfortable two weeks ago.
Striker Ivan Zamorano and Fernando Hierro will be missing from the
Spaniard's line-up.
In the same group, Ajax will aim to book a quarter-final berth with a
home victory over Grasshoppers Zurich, who are without a point or a
goal.
Bobby Robson's Porto, in Group A, travel to Athens looking for revenge
over Panathinaikos, who upset them 1-0 in Portugal, while French
champions Nantes will be looking to bounce back from a bad defeat in
Athens two weeks ago in their visit to Aalborg of Denmark.

THEY play for the best club in the country bar none. Only they don't
play for it every week.
There are three of them in the current Scottish international squad,
two of them expected to be in the side to face Western Samoa. A fourth
is coming back after serious injury and may feature in Jim Telfer's
plans later in the season. The Exiles will definitely demand their
services in the District championship.
They are the boys from Bath -- a quartet of Scots who willingly travel
the length and breadth of Britain to pull on blue jerseys, but who,
individually and collectively, are thinking about their future.
Prop David Hilton, back-row man Eric Peters and scrum half Andy Nicol
face the toughest of tests to make the Bath first team. Lock Andy Reed,
when he is fit again, will do the same.
Only Peters played in the league game against Saracens last Saturday,
Nicol and Hilton were left out. This is not a pleasant experience for
internationalists.
''It has been a bit of a nightmare for me this season,'' admitted
Hilton, one of Scotland's stars in the World Cup. ''They say I am the
best scrummager in the club, but I am unable to find a regular spot.
''Don't get me wrong, I love the Bath club, I just don't love playing
in the reserves. I will certainly try to win my place back, but I have
to think ahead.''
David is a self-employed butcher with his own shop in Bristol. ''If
somebody offered to set me up in Scotland I would be delighted to come
up and play there.''
There are those who believe that Bath are discriminating against their
Scots not only because they wish to help the English international
cause, but also because Peters and Hilton missed last year's cup final
due to Scottish commitments. Team manager John Hall has publicly refuted
such suggestions.
''We pick the team we believe to be the best. When you are undefeated
at the top of the league, it is hard to make changes. There is no bias
against the Scots.''
Andy Nicol, St Andrew's graduate, British Lion and trainee manager for
the packaging firm of Lawson Mardon of Bristol, did start the season as
the first choice scrum half but has since given way to Ian Sanders.
The former Dundee player is determined to fight back. ''I like the
area and have just moved into a new flat so I am not going anywhere.
Before I came here, I knew it would be tough.
''Obviously, you can't stay in the reserves forever but I believe I
can make it here.''
After a serious knee injury which kept him on the sidelines for a
season -- and a less drastic knock which cost him his World Cup place --
Andy is eager to resume his international career. There is likely to be
fierce competition for the No.9 spot, with Gary Armstrong and Derek
Patterson also challenging Bryan Redpath.
Nicol will be happy to play for the Exiles -- ''I need big games'' --
and thinks they have a fair chance of retaining the District title.
Does that mean that the Exiles could be one of Scotland's
representatives in European competition next season? And what if Bath
are also involved? Who has first pick
''Nobody knows,'' conceded Nicol. ''It will take a generation before
the effects of rugby going open is fully felt.''
He does not want to be a full-time player. Nor does Eric Peters, a
chartered surveyor with King Sturge and Co.
''No, I want to continue with my career, have the best of both worlds,
I suppose. Mind you, if I was 19 I might feel differently.
''Of course, it is a challenge for all us Scots at Bath. But this is
the premier club in England and they play in an attractive style. I like
to think that helps me when I pull on a Scotland shirt.''
Many see Peters as a future Scottish captain and he is well respected
by his colleagues. Even with that tag, however, he would not be a
certain first choice at Bath.
Eric's firm has offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow -- if he transferred
North his services would be snapped up. At the moment, like his
team-mates, he stays put. One wonders, though, whether the quartet will
be in the same place a year from now.
For, whether it is Districts or clubs which carry Scotland's colours
into Europe, I cannot see the Exiles being allowed to compete. If that
is the case, then what is the justification for their existence? Should
they be disbanded or left out of the District championship, the Scottish
Bath boys will be denied a representative platform.
There might be a train heading North with several one-way tickets.

LIVERPOOL manager Roy Evans last night accused his side of falling
asleep as Brondby defender Dan Eggen knocked them out of the UEFA Cup at
Anfield.
They went into their second round, second leg game having scored 13
goals in a week, and Evans admitted: ''You always have the worry that
when you have scored so many goals, you will have a night that you choke
on. We had enough chances.''
As for the goal after 78 minutes by Eggen, he said: ''First of all
there was a shot which caught our keeper unawares. When the corner came
over, we fell asleep.''

UEFA CUP
HOWARD Wilkinson, the Leeds manager, held a long dressing room inquest
last night after his side's 3-0 defeat by PSV Eindhoven in Holland. Two
goals from Phillipe Cocu and an own-goal by John Pemberton condemned
Leeds to a 8-3 aggregate defeat.
And the Yorkshire club's captain Gary McAllister said little as he
boarded a coach for the airport. ''What can I say? What can anyone
say?''
The police had something to say to about 100 Leeds fans when they
ordered them deported under a little-used Dutch law which demands that
fans going to games must have proper identification papers.
Nottingham Forest held Auxerre to a goalless draw at the City Ground
for a 1-0 aggregate win. But manager Frank Clark admitted: ''For passing
and movement they are the best side we've played since I've been manager
here.''
Benfica needed two late goals to scrape an aggregate win over Roda.
The Lisbon club, who took a 1-0 lead into the second leg, trailed 2-0
with only five minutes to go. But just when it seemed the Dutch side
were about to celebrate a famous win, Hassan Nader two to save Benfica.
Germany's Werder Bremen, 5-0 up from the first leg against Dynamo
Minsk, completed the formality of moving into round three, but will be
disappointed with their 2-1 reverse in Belarus.
There was a surprise in Rome, where Lazio lost 2-0 at home to Lyon,
who advanced 4-1 on aggregate with goals from Eric Assadourian and
Florian Maurice.
There was more French sparkle in Russia, where Bordeaux won 1-0 at
Rotor Volgograd, first-round conquerors of Manchester United, to win 3-1
on aggregate.

BIG-HITTING Scot Ross Matheson had no answer to Nick Gould, the
22-year-old Bristol player, who proved far too consistent when the
Guardian Direct British National Championships began at Telford
yesterday.
Gould won 6-2, 6-4 in the first round of the men's singles and earned
the doubtful distinction of a probable second-round match against the
holder, Jeremy Bates, who also announced a retirement date yesterday.
Matheson served with great power and struck the ball harder on both
wings than Gould, but too often he was erratic. The 25-year-old from
Glasgow lost his serve in the fifth and seventh games to concede the
opening set. He then crucially surrendered his service again, in the
fifth game of the second set.
Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman confirmed their status as the bright
hopes of British tennis. Top seed Rusedski defeated Colin Bennett 6-2,
6-1, and Henman won 6-2, 6-4 against 16-year-old Iain Bates of
Hampshire.
Meanwhile, Bates will not cut his links with tennis once he retires
after next year's Wimbledon. The 33-year-old, who defends his men's
singles and doubles titles at Telford, has left the door open for a
possible coaching post.
* BORIS Becker, the No.3 seed, bounced back from a set down to win
3-6, 6-3, 6-4 against tenacious Russian Alexander Volkov in the second
round of the #1.5m Paris Open last night.
After two days, no seeds have been beaten but fourth seed Michael
Chang also had a tough time. The American went a set down to Byron Black
of Zimbabwe before winning 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
* MONICA Seles has pulled out of the Bank of the West Classic in
Oakland, California, because of recurrent knee problems.
Seles, who has developed new problems because of her lack of practice
and conditioning on indoor courts, also is pulling out of next week's
WTA Tour event in Philadelphia and does not know if she will be able to
play in the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in New York in
November.

THAMES Water emphatically ruled itself out as a possible bidder for
London Electricity yesterday and also as a white knight in the event of
a hostile takeover bid for its utility cousin.
Chief executive Mike Hoffman said that such a takeover would not
enhance shareholder value, although the two are intent on co-operation
in areas such installations to new houses and digging holes in the
street. They also plan to share information technology for new billing
systems.
After a 25p rise on Monday on hopes of a takeover announcement
yesterday morning, London Electricity shares retreated 18p to 902p,
while Thames advanced 6p to 527p.
The company also ruled out mergers with other water companies or
utilities in the way North West Water has bid for NorWeb.
Sentiment was further helped by a 12% increase in interim dividend,
which was above expectations, accompanied by the forecast that there
would be a similar rise in the year's total, pointing to a 6.6% yield.
Group pre-tax profits for the six months to September improved 10% to
#165m. The core utility side advanced by 7% to #168m, the drought
costing #3m, on a 4.2% rise in turnover.
That reflected increasing efficiency. The workforce is decreasing by
about 200 annually, while Thames claims advances on several fronts such
as water quality, customer treatment and availability of supply, which
is now almost 100%. Its bills are also the lowest in England and Wales.
It is able to retrieve 55% of all rain falling in the Thames Basin,
which compares with 18% by the second best in the industry. And even
during the worst of the drought there were 60 days supply in hand at
normal rates of usage. Rainfall was 39% of the summer average and demand
was 25% higher.
Overall leakage is about 30% of which 10% is attributable to
customers. The company intends to halve the total by 2003, partly by
replacing a sixth of all mains.
In the last two or three years, Thames has been one of the poorest
performing water shares largely due to the unsatisfactory
diversifications outside its core utility activities. But now there is
the promise that these should make profits in about two years as past
investment pays off.

COSMETICS
BODY Shop, the right-on cosmetics and toiletries group, yesterday
denied that it was about to be taken private in the near future, if at
all.
The company, founded by chief executive Anita Roddick, was forced to
issue the denial following speculation that Anita and chairman Gordon
Roddick are talking to bankers with a view to raising funds to buy back
the group, 11 years after it was floated on the London Stock Exchange.
Despite the denial, the board acknowledged that there had been
preliminary discussions on taking the company private. The Roddicks, who
own 24% of the Body Shop, are thought to be considering an offer of less
than 200p a share on behalf of a newly created charitable trust.
This would aim to make donations to humanitarian and environmental
causes. At 175p per share the bid would be valued at #332m. Despite the
denial, Body Shop's share price jumped 21p higher to 156p.
American bank Morgan Stanley is thought to have arranged the senior
lending with Goldman Sachs appointed to advise the non-executive
directors, who include Penny Hughes, former president of Coca-Cola Great
Britain and Ireland, on the task of protecting the interests of minority
shareholders.
Ian McGlinn, a former garage owner who made a fortune by putting up
the money for Ms Roddick's second shop, is believed to have agreed to
sell his 28% stake. One City analyst said there was little likelihood of
anyone else stalking the firm ''its culture sets it too far apart from
others''.
The Body Shop came to the stockmarket in April 1984 in a flotation
valued at #4.8m. Its social campaigning on issues such as human rights
and domestic violence and innovative products such as Peppermint Foot
Lotion and Banana Conditioner, set it apart from the High Street crowd.
Recently the group has suffered from difficult trading in the US which
has had an adverse impact on the overall performance of the group. In
the six months to August, Body Shop's profits fell 26% to #9.1m despite
a 15% rise in group sales.
In addition, the share price has been hit by continued sniping from
critics who have claimed that the retailer is not as ''green'' as its
image suggests.

LENDING
THE four Scottish clearing banks enjoyed faster growth in mortgage
lending during the third quarter than in the previous two. However, the
net new lending figure of #370m in the three months to end-September was
well adrift of that for the same period last year.
Third-quarter figures, released by the Committee of Scottish Clearing
Bankers yesterday, relate to the four banks' mortgage lending both north
and south of the Border.
In the third quarter of last year, the banks' mortgage lending grew by
#484m. The major slowdown in the mortgage market is further illustrated
by the fact that the Scottish clearers' mortgage books grew by #553m in
the third quarter of 1993.
Nevertheless, Scottish banks are continuing to achieve significant
increases in their mortgage lending. In spite of an uninspired housing
market, the outstanding mortgage balances of Bank of Scotland, Royal
Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, and TSB Scotland grew by nearly
#1500m in the 12 months to end-September.
The total outstanding balance was #15.5bn. The latest increase of
#370m compares with one of only #325m for the first quarter and #352m
for the second.
Peter Burt, chairman of the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers and
Bank of Scotland treasurer, said: ''With highly competitive products and
a focus on delivering a quality service, we believe that the banks are
continuing to gain market share.''
He added that, in the current economic climate, it was very
encouraging to have an expansion of 10% in the last 12 months in the
''important'' mortgage lending market.

PRIVATE nursing home group Tamaris plans to almost double its presence
in Scotland within the next eight months increasing the number of homes
from four to seven.
The group's cluster of existing homes is centred on Dundee, chosen for
its good transport links. However, there is thought to be scope to open
at least one home in the north of Scotland, an area traditionally
ignored by the major public nursing home groups.
Alongside the expansion of its Scottish business, Tamaris intends to
expand geographically with the development of a cluster of homes in
north east England. The company, whose chairman is William Fitch, is
considering several financing offers from both domestic and overseas
investors to finance its development programme.
This could involve joint venture partners or Real Estate Investment
Trusts (REITs). Gearing currently stands at just under 100%.
The group is close to meeting its target of 2000 beds by the end of
next year. It currently operates almost 700 beds with an occupancy level
of 94%.
Turnover in the six months to 30 September jumped by 132% to #4.3m and
profit before tax rose by 417% to #610,000. The profit includes an
exceptional gain of #229,000 on the sale of one of its homes.
Tamaris is paying its first dividend of 0.02p, equivalent to 1% of its
market capitalisation.

<HEADLINE>A man on the up goes down under INTERVIEW: Australian Frank Cicutto says he is unrepentant about changes at the Clydesdale.</HEADLINE>

FRANK Cicutto regrets that he will not be around to reap personally
the fruit of far-reaching changes he has produced at the Clydesdale Bank
over the last two years as chief executive.
During that time, the 44-year-old Australian has brought in a fresh
generation of senior managers, revamped the bank's management culture,
invested heavily in new technology and helped to launch a life assurance
business.
The process has not been painless as a one-day strike on February 27
over the introduction of a new pay structure showed.
But Mr Cicutto, who has been appointed to a top job in Melbourne with
Clydesdale's parent, National Australia Bank, is unrepentant.
''Particularly in financial services, management is all about managing
change and the institution that can get to the future first by best
managing change will be the winner. There is absolutely no doubt about
that in my mind,'' he told The Herald in an interview.
This philosophy means embracing new technology with open arms,
learning new marketing skills and improving customer service.
It also means dumping the idea that banking is different from any
other mainstream economic activity.
''Banks need to understand that they are both retailers and
manufacturers,'' Mr Cicutto said. ''We as a bank need to be as
proficient as Marks &amp; Spencer is when it comes to retailing side of the
business and also as efficient as the world's best manufacturer, Toyota
or whoever.''
''I believe that banks are 15 to 20 years behind on the manufacturing
side,'' he added.
Looking at the UK banking sector as a whole, Mr Cicutto sees 50%
over-capacity and regards further consolidation along the lines of the
recent Lloyds-TSB merger as inevitable.
''The steamroller is careering away and its unstoppable,'' he said.
''Consolidation will continue and be forced on the existing players.
And National Australia Bank, which has traditionally grown by
acquisition, could be a key player in the process.
The group already owns Clydesdale in Scotland, Yorkshire Bank in
northern England and Northern Bank in Northern Ireland, but it still has
a gaping hole in its branch network in wealthy southern England.
''Every bank of any size here in the UK has looked at building
societies and the changes that are taking place in the market place the
NAB group are no different to that,'' Mr Cicutto said.
''We are continuing to look at the changes and monitor and take the
appropriate action,'' he added.
Mr Cicutto has done away with the old ''command and control''
structure of management at Clydesdale, bringing in a new breed of young
managers, typified by his designated successor, Fred Goodwin, a
37-year-old chartered accountant who only joined the bank seven months
ago.
''We want to have a culture that is action-orientated, recognises
initiative and commitment, where the individual can freely express his
views and he will be listened to,'' he said.
The second plank of change has been heavy investment in new
technology. National Australia Bank is spending #90m to equip Clydesdale
and Yorkshire Bank with new computer systems and technology.
Mr Cicutto hints that this will be the key to the future launch of new
banking services offering an alternative to branch or phone-based
business, but he is reluctant to give details.
What he does admit is that heavy investment in new technology will
keep Clydesdale's cost base rather high for the next 18 months.
The banks annual results, due out on November 16, will show the
cost/income ratio continuing above 60%, he said.
This compares unfavourably with a ratio of only 50.3% at Bank of
Scotland and 52.1% at Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale's two main
competitors.
The third area of innovation is in the range of financial products on
offer.
Clydesdale was closely involved in setting up National Australia Life,
a #58m life insurance company based in Clydebank which began trading two
weeks ago. Its products are being sold through the Clydesdale and
Yorkshire Bank networks.
And Clydesdale is reshaping its traditional savings and loans products
to make them more flexible and attractive.
A case in point is its new flexible repayment mortgage policy, based
on a concept pioneered several years ago by its parent bank in
Australia.
The new mortgage deal allows borrowers to vary the annual level of
repayment, take out extra chunks of credit or pay back part of the loan
in advance of maturity.
Clydesdale has also launched an offensive to beef up its corporate
lending business, which has traditionally concentrated on small and
medium-sized firms.
David Peebles, 32, was recently brought in as head of treasury from
Royal Bank of Scotland and John Berry, 44, was recruited from Bank of
Scotland as head of corporate banking, to lead an onslaught on the
business sector.
Mr Cicutto, who departs for Australia in March, says Clydesdale's
network of 310 branches is bound to undergo changes, but it will be
basically maintained, particularly in rural areas.
''I believe the branch network will continue to be a key plank of
Clydesdale's distribution. It will remain our eyes and ears in the
community,'' he said.
The bank, which has been present for 120 years in Cumbria, opened a
new branch on the outskirts of Carlisle on Monday and aims to improve
its weak representation in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.
But Mr Cicutto warned that some branches elsewhere would close.
He ruled out any major move by Clydesdale into England beyond its
niche market in Cumbria, saying ''our first priority is to conquer
Scotland''.
But Clydesdale has a long way to go. It is the smallest of Scotland's
big-three clearing banks, controlling just over 20% of a market where
new players are threatening to crowd in.
''Margins are moving and technology is is moving and there is a
continuing entrance of new players who are not burdened with the past,''
Mr Cicutto said, pointing to the entrance of retail groups like Virgin
and Marks &amp; Spencer into banking activities.
Despite this prospect of fiercer competition, he regards the
introduction of charges for cheque transactions as inevitable.
Mr Cicutto pointed out that UK banks currently spend #4500m a year on
processing cheques, yet in most cases this charge is not passed on
directly to the customer, since three-quarters of all Britons enjoy
charge-free banking.
''I think that at some time in the future the principle of the user
pays will be extended further than it is today,'' he said.
Mr Cicutto sees the growth of the electronic and telecommunications
industries in Scotland as encouraging developments, which will help keep
the country at the forefront of technology.
''One can only be encouraged by some of the recent successes we have
seen in encouraging inward investment,'' he said, citing Motorola as an
example.
But Mr Cicutto faults Scots for having failed to think though the
economic implications of devolution properly.
''Devolution would be good if there is a clear financial advantage to
Scotland -- will it put more bread on the table, will it put more money
into the pockets of Scottish people? If it does then I would be all for
it, but I don't think that argument has been made as yet,'' he said.
Reflecting on the federal constitution of Australia, where each state
has its own government and elected assembly, Mr Cicutto said this raised
more problems for business in terms of bureaucracy than in terms of
political decision-making.
Will Mr Cicutto miss Scotland when he goes back to Melbourne to become
chief general manager of National Australia Bank's network of 1300
domestic branches? You bet.
He has developed a taste for haggis and, spoiled by the best summer in
200 years, he even likes the Scottish weather.
Living in Bridge of Weir, he has enjoyed semi-rural living within easy
reach of Glasgow and he reckons Scotland is the only place he would
seriously consider retiring to other than his native Sydney.
But with an eight-year-old son to bring up and a new high-powered job
ahead of him, it will be a long time before that happens.

TENS of thousands of Scottish households might still be at risk from
carbon monoxide poisoning, a year after the introduction of new
standards, the Health and Safety Executive warned yesterday.
Dr Terry Williams, one of the agency's inspectors in Scotland, said
about 90% of homes were likely to have been checked by a qualified
installer within the past year.
Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the new standards for gas
appliances and flues, the Gas Safety (Installations and Use)
Regulations.
They compel all landlords to carry out annual checks on their
property. Home-owners are not covered by the regulations but the HSE is
actively encouraging them to undertake regular surveys of their gas
supply and fittings.
In 1993-94, two people died in the West of Scotland from carbon
monoxide poisoning -- dubbed the ''invisible killer'' -- and a further
40 suffered poisoning because of faulty appliances or flues.
Dr Williams said: ''This year, we are determined to ensure that every
tenant living in rented accommodation in Scotland is aware of his or her
rights.
''Landlords and managing agents have a responsibility not just to have
a safety check on gas appliances carried out but to keep a record and
make this available to tenants if they ask to see it.''
A landlord can be fined up to #5000 for failing to meet the
regulations. If he or she ignores an improvement or prohibition order,
the penalties rise to a maximum of #20,000 or imprisonment.

Disaster at sea and a tramp helped rocket composer Gavin Bryars to
fame, but as Michael Tumelty explains, it took an introduction to opera
to mature the master.
IT'S amazing what can be achieved with a little cult status. Composer
Gavin Bryars started writing his opera Medea in 1981. Fourteen years
later, it will finally receive its UK premiere, in an unstaged concert
version, this Friday at the Tramway.
It probably wouldn't have been happening at all (considering Bryars
was effectively ignored for 17 years by the establishment in this
country) if it hadn't been for the small matter of a dead tramp and a
sunken Atlantic liner.
The most recent recordings of Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me, Bryars's
epic composition built on the taped voice of an old down and out singing
a pathetically optimistic hymn, and the evocative Sinking of the
Titanic, constructed around the hymn the band allegedly played as the
liner went down, catapulted Bryars into the charts with massive record
sales and instant worldwide recognition.
More or less overnight, Bryars, now in his early fifties, and
previously known only in new music circles, was transformed into an
international commodity, cult figure, and one of the hottest properties
in the music business. His group -- the Gavin Bryars Ensemble -- now
tours the world feeding an apparently insatiable demand for concert
performances of Jesus' Blood, the Titanic, and his other works.
The road to Medea, as it will be heard on Friday night, is as
multi-layered and complex as the career of the Yorkshire composer
himself. For starters, Medea didn't even begin life as an opera. It was,
in part, in a different language from its present form. And nor was it
ever intended for the Theatre de Lyons, where it eventually received its
premiere in 1984.
Bryars's own route to cult status, a position which leaves him
sanguine and gently self-mocking -- ''I'm just lucky; there's no
accounting for taste'' -- is fascinatingly varied. Of solid,
down-to-earth Yorkshire stock, his career has embraced jazz -- he took
up double bass while studying philosophy at Sheffield University -- and
accompanist, in the resident band of a working man's club, to such
sixties' luminaries as Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.
At another cultural pole altogether, he was assistant to the great
American guru of experimental music, John Cage, at Illinois University,
he taught art history in a number of colleges, and performed (with
Michael Nyman, another figure come late to cult status) in the Steve
Reich Ensemble, during the touring heyday of the great American
minimalist group in the seventies.
By the seventies, Bryars had dumped everything he had written to date
-- ''I don't think it was very good'' -- except the Sinking of the
Titanic, which had 25 years to wait before its day in the sun. He was
also approaching a three-year period where he stopped writing music
altogether.
Here Bryars is keen to set the record straight about the wide
speculation on his ''silent years'', where he was assumed to be
suffering an artistic block or crisis. ''There was none, there was no
problem,'' he said. ''Basically I stopped to teach art history courses
on Marcel Duchamp, which I was getting more out of at the time.''
Also, in the mid-seventies, all the crucial influences that would form
the stylistic basis (though he didn't know it at the time) for the
phenomenal success that awaited him in the nineties, were coming
together.
The mention of Marcel Duchamp is not coincidental. The entire concept
of using objets trouves -- found material -- fascinated Bryars. Both
Jesus' Blood and the Titanic involved working with already existing
materials.
''I could relate that to my experiences in art colleges,'' said
Bryars. ''The things which were current at that time were the aftermath
of pop art and conceptual art -- dislocating things from a previous
existence and putting them into new environments.''
The other major influence was American minimalist music, or rather,
one aspect of it. What appealed to Bryars was the essentially static
nature of the music below its fast surface. ''I didn't like the fast
tempos and the high dynamic,'' he said.
''The loudness and directness of it seemed to me to be very brash and
American; I was more interested in things which were a little more
oblique.''
A crucial stage in the development of Bryars's career came in the
mid-seventies when he started working with Brian Eno, founder of Obscure
Records, former member of Roxy Music, and innovative guru of conceptual
rock music. Through his recordings with Eno, Bryars came to attention of
the forward-looking European avant-garde.
In this country, he said, there was very little interest at the time:
between 1970 and 1987, there was not a single radio broadcast of
Bryars's music in the UK.
That European interest led directly to the invitation, in 1981, to
meet American director-designer Robert Wilson, who had a project to
stage a performance of Medea, as a play with incidental music, at the
Fenice in Venice.
Wilson wanted an idea of the sort of music that would be appropriate
to Medea herself, to Jason, and so on. Bryars did a demo tape. Wilson
liked it and wanted more, by now keen to have some of it actually sung.
Within months, said Bryars, the play had become an opera, requiring four
and a half hours' music.
''It was an incredibly brave thing for Bob Wilson to accept me to
do,'' said Bryars. ''I'd never written anything for the human voice
before, I'd never written anything for the theatre before, I'd never
written anything for orchestra before.'' And to cap that field of
ignorance, he said, he'd only ever seen one opera in his life.
''I was naive. I was innocent. And, at the risk of reinventing the
wheel, I had to learn very fast.''
Then, after all the work, the Venice project became a fiasco -- the
Italians had forgotten to contract the technical staff, and the costumes
weren't made. The whole thing was cancelled, and was eventually picked
up by the Theatre de Lyons two years later.
Even then the route to performance was fraught. Bryars had written one
scene in a cool jazz, Miles Davis/Gil Evans style for the original black
singers. They were replaced and he had to rewrite.
Then the French were up in arms over the fact that the opera, in Greek
and English, would feature an American director, an English composer, an
Anglo-American conductor, and an Australian soprano. Bryars had to
rewrite some of it to incorporate the French language. Eventually, in
1984, it happened, and triggered the launch proper of Bryars's
international career.
Friday's UK premiere will be shorter than the original -- a huge
prologue, which was mimed in the opera, is irrelevant to a concert
performance, and has been removed. Other sections have been rewritten.
For an interpretation of the wronged Medea herself, slaughtering all
around her, including her own children, Bryars has taken an unusual
view. ''She is completely immoveable, completely in control,'' he said.
''On one level she is vengeful, but you can see this reading where
she's not the screaming harridan, bringing down all around her. She is
very cool and is surrounded by irrational characters, all losing their
reason.''
The music, which is largely tonal, thus tends to reflect this, said
Bryars. ''It too is rather cool, almost abstract. And having it in Greek
makes it more so: it detaches it from the emotional heat you would
otherwise get.''
Medea is an old piece, and Bryars's style has matured. And he does
continue to work on his ''open'' pieces, Jesus' Blood and the Titanic.
So how does he feel about tinkering with Medea now? ''It's almost like
writing a pastiche of myself to make it consistent with the rest of the
opera.
''There are still aspects of it I listen to, wince, and think --
Christ, that's naive. I could go back and rewrite the whole thing, but
eventually I have to say, no, that's it, leave it.''
* Medea at the Tramway on Friday at 7.30pm.

SALIM Malik, the former Pakistan captain at the centre of cricket's
bribery affair, declined to comment after being beseiged by the media on
his arrival in Australia yesterday. Malik, accused by Australian test
players Shane Warne, Tim May, and Mark Waugh of offering them money to
play poorly during Australia's tour to Pakistan last year, was
confronted by reporters at Perth airport.
''I am just here to play cricket. Please excuse me, let me go,'' Malik
politely asked several dozen reporters as he battled through the throng.
The veteran batsman was selected for the current six-week tour to
Australia after having been cleared of the bribery charges by an
internal inquiry in Pakistan 10 days ago.
In a separate development on Tuesday, May threatened to take legal
action against anyone who accuses him again of concocting the bribery
charges he laid against Malik.
An inquiry headed by former Pakistan Supreme Court Judge Fakhruddin
Ebrahim said the charges against Malik appeared to have been concocted,
while May said he would never impugn the honour of Australian cricket by
fabricating such a serious allegation.
Meanwhile, Pakistan narrowly escaped defeat in their four-day match
against Western Australia in Perth. Set 428 to win, the tourists were
teetering on 226 for eight when bad light stopped play after tea on the
fourth day at the WACA.
Basit Ali saved his side with a resolute 69 not out, occupying the
crease for more than four hours after Pakistan had resumed on 54 for
one. Ramiz Raja top scored with 84 before lofting a catch to Jo Angel at
square leg.
Opener Salim Elahi, who shared a 94-run partnership with Ramiz for the
second wicket, followed his half-century in the first innings with a
solid 40. His resistance ended just before lunch when was caught behind
off Angel, leaving Basit to carry the lower order, which he just about
managed.

Lothian Schools 18, Midlands Schools 23
MIDLANDS Schools scored their second victory to remain undefeated in
the Bank of Scotland Schools under-18 inter district championship with
this win yesterday over Lothian Schools at Goldenacre.
Despite the wet conditions in Edinburgh, the match was a free-flowing
contest that produced five tries, Midlands finishing ahead by three to
two, a ratio which also reflected the visitors' overall superiority.
Midlands' pack in which Simon Taylor was outstanding at openside
flanker, had the edge in the set scrums where they achieved three
tighthead strikes, while at the lineout, good work by John Gay and Rob
Steven neutralised the presence in the Lothians side of Scottish
Schools' lock Jason White.
Behind the scrum Midlands backs matched Lothians, notably at stand-off
where Greig Mason measured up well against the Scottish Schools'
stand-off Gordon Ross.
After Ross and Mason had each kicked a penalty goal, Midlands revealed
their attacking skills with a fine try created by Steve Keatch and
finished by full back Gregor Lawson.
Mason converted and added a second penalty in reply to a stylish try
for Lothains by wing Stuart Hogg. But just before half time Midlands
right wing Stuart Walker made the running to set up a try for left wing
Chris Milne.
Gordon Hood's try for Lothians, the conversion and then a penalty goal
by Ross brought the scores level at 18-all, but a minute before full
time, Lawson made a searing break which ended with Milne crossing for
his second try of the match to give victory to Midlands.
Lothian Schools -- J Walkinshaw (Stewart's-Melville); S Hogg (George
Heriot's), M di Rollo (George Watson's), G Hood (George Heriot's), A
Raistrick (Stewart's-Melville); G Ross (George Heriot's), S Grant
(George Heriot's); P Mowat (George Watson's), A McLean (George
Heriot's), C Buchanan, J White (both George Watson's), T Stephens, C
Capaldi (both Stewart's-Melville), H Calder, C McColghry (both George
Watson's).
Midlands Schools -- G Lawson; S Walker, C Carnochan, P Hudson (all
Dollar Academy), C Milne (Dundee HS); G Mason (Dollar Academy), S Keatch
(Dundee HS) capt; M Welch (Dunfermline HS), S McKinnon, J Nelson (both
Queen Victoria), R Steven (Madras Coll), J Gay (Dundee HS), C Stevenson
(Waid Academy), D Duncan (Dollar Academy), S Taylor (Morrison's
Academy).

ROB Wainwright will surely be confirmed as Gavin Hastings's successor
as Scotland captain today when the side to play Western Samoa is
announced at a Murrayfield news conference.
Wainwright, 30, has been the captain-in-waiting since Hastings retired
after the World Cup in South Africa this summer, and if the job went to
anyone else, it would be the biggest surprise since O J Simpson walked
free from a Los Angeles courtroom.
The army doctor, currently based in Catterick but soon to move back to
Edinburgh where Watsonians and his former club Edinburgh Academicals are
vying for his services, should have skippered Scotland on their tour to
Argentina last year, but he was forced to call off because of injury.
Wainwright will be winning his eighteenth cap for Scotland against the
Samoans on November 18.
Wainwright's selection was probably one of the easiest facing the
selectors who met to pick the team on Monday night. There are few easy
choices. Beginning with the front row, much will depend on how
tight-head prop Peter Wright fares with the disciplinary panel.
On the other side of the front row Dave Hilton is a cert, but at
hooker, the selectors have a headache. If he recovers in time from his
knee injury, Kevin McKenzie will get the nod. Martin Scott and Jim Hay,
both also suffering from short-term injuries, also come into the
equation and lurking on the sidelines is the retired Kenny Milne.
Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin are the sitting tenants at lock. The
selectors have stuck with Cronin, the invisible man in France, in the
past but Stewart Campbell represents the future, and it begins on
November 18.
I would go with a back-row of Wainwright, Eric Peters at No.8 and
Stuart Reid at blind-side flank. The selectors may prefer a specialist
open-side like Ian Smith but, against the heavy-hitting Samoans, Reid
would be my man for a debut.
The half-backs will in all likelihood be Bryan Redpath and Craig
Chalmers. I would, though, have Gary Armstrong on the bench on the basis
that he should be involved.
My centres would be Gregor Townsend and Graham Shiel, even although
Shiel has not recaptured the sparkling form he displayed in South
Africa. If he is to play the short-yardage game, though, then there is
still only one Ian Jardine.
Kenny Logan on the left wing represents a conservative selection and I
would be sorely tempted to look to the future and make the switch to
full back now.
On the other wing, Derek Stark is the outstanding candidate but only
if Tony Stanger, as a now impoverished student in these days of
professional rugby, cannot be persuaded to resume the old position.
If Logan is not to replace Big Gav, then Mike Dods, now of
Northampton, may seek to maintain family tradition and assume the mantle
once carried by his 1984 Grand Slam brother, Peter.

THE position of families within society is an issue which is
exercising the minds of a growing number of Tory backbenchers keen to
redress what they see as a balance of policies which favour unmarried
couples and single parents.
The role of women within the family has changed markedly in recent
years not least because of their growing economic independence.
A growing number of women are the major breadwinners as men are
suffering disproportionately from the changing structure of the labour
market.
Moves towards increased flexibile working has favoured women, who have
traditionally worked part-time. Whatever ethnic group you consider,
unemployment is higher among young men than women.
UK male employment collapsed by two million jobs between 1977 and
1991. In contrast, between 1983 and 1990, female employment jumped by
22%. Employment among women with dependent children increased from 49%
in 1981 to 59% by 1992, half of this employment growth being in
full-time work.
Flexible working manifests itself in many ways. Homeworking,
job-shares, short-term contracts, zero hours and part-time working are
all characteristics of the British labour market in the 1990s. All of
these types of atypical work have major potential advantages and
disadvantages that need to be weighed up carefully.
Flexibility in the labour market could combine advantages for both
employees and employers, a situation where the need for different
flexible work forms are acknowledged, as well as the fact that people
have different contributions to make and varying employment and income
needs throughout their working lives.
So far it appears to be working more in favour of employers, keen to
reduce costs and remain competitive in a global marketplace.
Women have traditionally worked part-time often in low paid, low
status jobs. In addition part-time working can often mean poorer job
security, lack of access to training and poor opportunities for
promotion.
The fact that women may want to work part-time does not mean they want
to work awkward, if flexible, hours. It does not have to be this way if
employers take a more constructive approach to different forms of
working. However, all too often if women want to progress up the career
ladder they have to adopt ''male'' forms of working.
The trade unions are trying to secure equal rights for part-time
workers but there could be a role for them to take a stronger stance
towards flexible work practices in general. They could help to change
attitudes and arrive at ''best practice'' models based on workplace
cultures. However, in many instances they are still too obsessed with
male-dominated manufacturing industry.
Several factors determine women's participation in the workforce.
State taxation, childcare and child benefits, personal income levels,
general health and welfare provisions all have a part to play.
Research has shown that high income earning mothers who can afford to
pay for childcare (and still have some money left) are more likely to
remain in the labour force when they have more than one child. A
perennial issue that crops up ahead of the Budget is the provision of
state-subsidised childcare.
Given the current Tory party emphasis on the traditional family it
appears unlikely that any tax breaks for childcare will be forthcoming
in the Budget.
Research carried out by the European Union shows that the issue of how
to reconcile work and family life is a European-wide problem. It needs
to be addressed if the labour market is to operate at maximum
productivity in terms of human resources, and offer genuine equal
opportunites to men and women.
International variations in female labour force participation are
accounted for by a number of factors: the relative importance of service
industries and occupations, employment strategies to meet service sector
demand, state provision of child-care facilities and State policy on the
respective responsibilities of the family and the state.
It is important that moves towards flexible working do not lead to a
general reduction in employee benefits.
There is a greater debate to be had in the UK as a whole on the
implications of the changing face of the labour market and women's
greater participation in the workplace.
For instance, what's to be done with the growing number of unemployed
men and who is to provide the care of the young and elderly that has
been traditionally been carried out by unpaid home-based women.

JONATHAN Davies is returning to rugby union after Warrington and
Cardiff agreed a fee for the Welshman.
Cardiff had offers of #30,000 and #55,000 for the 33-year-old rejected
during weeks of talks, but an undisclosed fee has now been accepted, and
Davies is soon expected to agree personal terms.
Warrington chairman Peter Higham said: ''We are happy with the deal.
We've had a couple of good years out of Jonathan and wish him all the
best in his new career.''
Davies stunned rugby union in 1989 by joining Widnes. And although he
has had his fair share of critics in league circles, he has silenced his
doubters time and again to become one of the greatest players to have
graced the code.
''I have given everything to the teams I have played for and I have
been well rewarded, not only financially, but in fulfilment, friendship
and some great team spirit,'' said Davies.

KENNY Logan and Alex Marshall moved into third place in their 12-team
section in the Hong Kong Classic Pairs yesterday after two wins and a
draw from their matches against local sides.
The Scots struggled in their opening game against Chan Hoi and Albert
Wu, from the Hong Kong Electric Sports Club, before winning 24-20, and
they followed that up with a 32-11 success against the Filipino Club,
but then Marshall had to salvage a 19-19 share of the spoils with
bowlers from China Light and Power.
The locals led 19-15 with just two ends to play, but Marshall killed
the second last and on the replay, grabbed a double and he drew two
shots on the last end to give the Scots a 19-19 share of the spoils.
That leaves them with seven points and in third spot in their section,
three behind South Africa and one behind New Zealand with Ireland on the
same points mark as the Scots.
The Channel Island pair of Adrian Welch and David Le Marquand lead
Section 2 with an unbeaten record, while England are in seventh place.

FISHING industry leaders on Orkney yesterday condemned the slaughter
of 25 grey seal pups on the islands.
Orkney Fisheries Association said it deeply regretted the attack,
which it said was ''totally abnormal''.
A police investigation is under way after the newborn pups were found
scattered on rocks at Green Head bay, South Ronaldsay, on Saturday.
All the pups -- some just days old and still with their umbilical
cords attached -- had been shot in the head at close range. An adult
female seal was found dead nearby with similar injuries.
In a statement after an Orkney Seafood Industry meeting yesterday, the
fisheries association, which represents fishermen and processors, said:
''The members abhor the recent seal culling on South Ronaldsay, which is
contrary to association policy.
''While there is no evidence of fisheries involvement in this sad and
isolated incident, we deeply regret its occurrence.
''We are certain that none of our members would be associated with
such an event, which is totally abnormal in Orkney.''

SIMS Food Group said yesterday it was selling the fresh red meats side
of its business as it announced sharply reduced profits.
In the six months to September 30, taxable profits at the meat and
poultry group tumbled to #150,000 from #1.2m in the corresponding period
last year.
The interim dividend is halved to 1p on earnings per share of nil
compared with 2.1p last time.
''The dominance in our business mix of fresh red meat operations
continues to leave the company overly exposed to the more volatile
sectors with low gross margins and little prospect for improvement in
the near future,'' the company said.
Sims wants to concentrate on turkey production and its newly-formed
cooked meats side.
John Stone, chairman of the Milton Keynes-based group, said he was
stepping down at the end of the financial year next April as part of a
board shake up.

CARLTON have come to the aid of Scotland's junior badminton scene by
backing the highly successfull Come And Try coaching sessions at the
Scottish Open to be held at the Kelvin Hall from November 22-26.
The tournament has no major sponsor to stump up the $15,000 prize
money needed to keep the event on the IBF Grand Prix circuit.
However Anne Smillie, Chief Executive of the SBU, revealed that
several deals are now in the pipeline.
The Come and Try sessions, which now also qualify for an award under
the Sportsmatch scheme, provide youngsters with top coaching and the
chance to watch badminton's big names on court.
There has already been a record entry from 19 countries for the
Scottish Open.
Meanwhile Scottish champions Anne Gibson and Bruce Flockhart have been
named as top seeds for this weekend's Scottish Invitation Singles at the
Cockburn Centre in Glasgow.

A NEW #6m B&amp;Q megastore opening in Glasgow on December 8 will create
250 jobs.
The store on Great Western Road at Drumchapel will be the size of
three football pitches. This is larger than its sister store which
opened in Aberdeen earlier this year creating 200 jobs.
A company spokesperson said this latest Scottish investment was part
of a new generation of B&amp;Q megastores being opened across the UK.

THE contest to find a site for a national sports stadium went into
extra time yesterday. Top administrators from football, rugby league and
athletics -- meeting in London -- ruled out Birmingham, Sheffield and
Bradford, but could not decide between Manchester or Wembley for the
21st century arena.
The main criteria for the bids was a stadium capable of hosting top
international and national sporting events -- with Birmingham, Sheffield
and Bradford being rejected because of planning, transportation and
funding problems.
The delay in coming to a final decision -- which could take up to six
months -- has been criticised, although Rodney Walker, chairman of the
Sports Council's steering group, insisted: ''If we are investing up to
#100m of National Lottery money, we have to get it right.''
Manchester, whose 2002 Commonwealth Games bid will be confirmed on
Friday, has the edge -- the northern venue costing #134m compared to
#167m for Wembley.

INDEPENDENT development capital fund manager Causeway yesterday
announced it had reached its #75m target for a fund which will provide
new capital to smaller UK quoted companies.
Subscriptions by UK and North American institutional investors were
the maximum permitted under the terms of the offering memorandum.
They bring total funds raised by London-based Causeway this year to
#140m, which represents a significant expansion.
Ian Hislop, joint managing director of the advisory company to the new
fund, said: ''Companies capitalised at up to #50m continue to have
difficulty in attracting institutional interest both for flotations and
for rights issues.
''We believe that this new fund will help to bridge this gap.''
Causeway, with funds under management of more than #275m, is
responsible for four institutionally-backed funds in the UK unquoted
market. The latest fund is its second in the quoted sector.

SCOTLAND'S Colin McRae must wait to find out whether he will be
hindered by Subaru team orders in his bid to become Britain's first
world rally champion next month.
Team leader Carlos Sainz has announced he will drive for Japanese
rivals Toyota next season, but Subaru are still undecided over whether
or not to employ the strategy they used in last week's Catalunya Rally
for the RAC Rally, which begin in Chester on November 19.
In Spain, McRae was ordered to step aside and allow Sainz to win his
home rally. They now share the lead in the world championship. ''We will
make a decision in the next week,'' said a Subaru spokeswoman.
In the meantime, Subaru chief David Richards has paid tribute to Sainz
for his part in taking the team to the brink of world championship
success. ''Carlos joined us when we were just starting out on a full
world championship challenge, now we are firmly established at the top
of the table,'' said Richards. ''We wish Carlos every success in the
future and will certainly be presenting him with his major opposition
next season.''
Subaru expect to announce a new team-mate for McRae, who will drive
for the Banbury-based team for the next two years, within the next few
days, and Richards promised that his team would be just as formidable
next year.
''Colin is the sort of driver on whom it is possible to build a
strong, committed, successful team, something that has not always been
possible in the past,'' he said.

COLIN Montgomerie, who on Sunday became Europe's No.1 professional for
the third successive year, has withdrawn from this week's #1.1m Sarazen
World Open, blaming exhaustion.
The Scot was to have played in the lead group tomorrow with defending
champion Ernie Els and Open champion John Daly.
Montgomerie clinched the European order of merit title by a single
stroke from Sam Torrance -- and now Torrance will take his place in
Georgia.
''Unfortunately, the last few weeks have taken their toll. I am
absolutely exhausted, both mentally and physically,'' said Montgomerie,
who has had his latest achievement recognised by being named October's
Johnnie Walker Golfer of the Month.
During October, Montgomerie, along with Torrance and Andrew Coltart,
also won the Alfred Dunhill Cup for Scotland for the first time.
Montgomerie, who also won the award in August when he took the German
Open only a fortnight after he had lost the US PGA Championship in a
play-off to Steve Elkington, receives a Tiffany-designed trophy and
#1000 each on behalf of the PGA European Tour Benevolent Fund and the
Golf Foundation.
The astonishing level of consistency reached by Montgomerie is
reflected in two sets of figures. His stroke average for 1995 was 69.70
from 20 tournaments compared with 69.60 from 21 tournaments last year
and, as on the European order of merit, he has never finished in a lower
placing than the previous season in the Sony world rankings.
To date on the latter Montgomerie is sixth, having progressed from
308th place in 1988 to 162nd, eighty-first, thirty-six, twentieth,
fourteenth, and eighth. On the smaller stage, Montgomerie has promoted
himself through the ranks from an initial fifty-second to twenty-fifth,
fourteenth, fourth, third, first, first, and first -- a triple dominance
last achieved by Severiano Ballesteros 17 years ago.
With the simultaneous ending at the weekend of the regular European
and US Tours the leading movements within the world rankings over the
first 10 months of the year can now be identified and of those within
the first 50 Torrance rose from thirty-eighth to fourteenth, second only
as an advance to Elkington's elevation from forty-third to ninth.
In the same category four of Europe's major championship winners went
in the oppposite direction. Jose Maria Olazabal, inhibited by his foot
injury, dropped from fifth to twelfth. More attributably to loss of
form, Nick Faldo regressed from third to fifth, Ballesteros from
fourteenth to twenty-fifth, and, in the heaviest fall of all, Ian
Woosnam from sixteenth to thirty-fifth.
Of the players who began the year outside the leading 50, Germany's
Alexander Cejka, whose victory in the Volvo Masters was his third of
1995, improved no fewer than 285 places, from 367th to eighty-second,
and Sweden's Sandelin, who will probably be nominated as Rookie of the
Year, emerged from darkest obscurity to 156th place.
Going in the reverse direction, Gordon Brand Jr, whose eighty-eighth
placing on Europe's merit list was his worst by 54 in 14 years on the
Tour, had that downward spiral reflected on the broader canvas. In the
Sony rankings he dropped 53 places, from sixtieth to 113th.

The car's looks, says Ross Finlay, are an acquired taste
WHILE anything labelled Executive is meant to be upper-class in some
car manufacturers' vocabularies, Ford makes it the entry level version
of the Scorpio range.
The model names are hardly progressive, going from Executive to Ghia
and then to Ultima, although I suppose you cannot have much more of a
last word than that.
It is unusual for Ford, in effect, to downgrade the Ghia name, which
is usually reserved for the top range of a model. Ford bought the Ghia
company of Turin, now celebrating its 80th anniversary, in 1972.
There are a few of us to whom anything labelled Scorpio will always
have a shortened nickname. Years ago, one car club navigational event in
which ''code boards'' each bearing a single letter were used as route
checks, the letters having to be noted down in order, was called the
Scorpio. We came on S, C, O and R in order, and later on, I followed by
O.
One or two people filled in the fifth space with a P which they had
never actually seen. But the organisers were not daft. There was no P
board at all, and anybody who noted it down ended up penalised. In the
fading memories of those of us who were there, the Scorio Rally it
remains.
With the Scorpio, Ford follows the familiar modern system of offering
any trim and equipment level with any engine in the range. So the turbo
diesel saloon version I have been driving comes as an Executive at
#19,145, a Ghia at #20,350 or an Ultima at #21,760.
Although you see more of them around now, many people still do a
double take when a Scorpio passes by. The external appearance is still
very much of an acquired taste.
Inside, though, the Scorpio is very roomy and comfortable, with an
impressive array of equipment in the higher-priced varieties. Air
conditioning, a CD autochanger, programmed electrical adjustment for the
driver's seat, cruise control and footwell courtesy lights are all
included in the Ultima specification.
Where the biggest Ford saloon knocks the opposition for six is in the
amount of passenger space it provides. The rear cabin is by far the
roomiest in the class, and provides comfortable lounging room which
would make long journeys there almost limousine-like.
Luggage volume is not as great as a glance at the rear end design
might suggest, because this rear-wheel drive car naturally has a fairly
high boot floor, though it is long and wide.
The Scorpio is easy to drive, and though there is no suggestion that
this is any kind of sporting saloon, the handling is reasonable enough
by the standards of the class.
Its turbo diesel engine is a 2.5-litre unit which peaks at 115bhp. A
time of just over 11 seconds from 0-60mph is very fair for such a
substantial car, but it is, as usual, in the middle range where the TD
scores, with a strong surge of overtaking power. Fuel consumption
returns, on the older style reckoning, range from 47mpg at 56mph to 36
at 75 and 27mpg around town.
Loping economically along a motorway is therefore the Scorpio turbo
diesel's strong suit, but that engine, not the most refined of its type
although quieter than some of Ford's earlier efforts, may not be an
ideal match for anything labelled Ultima.

DESIGNER cookware group Le Creuset, famous for its brightly coloured
oven-to-tableware, is to revert to private ownership.
Since 1989, the company's share have been quoted on the Unlisted
Securities Market, (USM) which is to close at the end of next year.
Le Creuset's board, under the chairmanship of Paul van Zuydam,
believes the company has not achieved any real benefits from its USM
quotation.
Mr van Zuydam owns just under 74% of the issued share capital.
Significant capital investment, acquisitions and the costs of
repositioning the company have been funded from internally generated
funds and bank debt alone.
Benefits to shareholders of the share quotation are also said to have
been limited because marketability of the shares is restricted.
Full proposals are expected to be put to shareholders before the end
of December.
In the six months to end June, the group increased its sales by 7% to
#22.7m. However, adverse currency movements led to a drop in pre-tax
profits to just #117,000 from #1.1m previously.

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH Office survey of combine crops for 1994 shows a 6% rise in
total production and, within that figure, a 48% increase in oil and
protein seed output.
Although the cereals area fell by almost 4%, total production rose by
6% because of higher yields. The rise in total oil and protein seed
production was based on an 11% increase in area grown coupled with much
improved yields for all crops.
The wheat area fell by more than 3% but an increase of over 4% in
yield gave a return of 7.4 tonnes a hectare. Spring barley area fell by
5% but the yield increased by 9% to 4.9 tonnes a hectare. Winter barley
showed a 5% area drop but an increased yield of 21% to give a return of
6.4 tonnes a hectare. The oats area was up by 15% and the yield by 31%.
Winter oilseed rape area fell by 2% but yield increased by 18% to 3.2
tonnes a hectare. The spring rape area was up by 37% and the yield rose
by 68% to 2.1 tonnes a hectare. The area of protein peas fell by 32% but
the yield more than doubled -- up to 4.9 tonnes a hectare.

PHILIP Hobbs, who has had a good start to the jumps season, should be
on the mark with Charged in the 'Eros Dash' Chase at Kempton today.
He is in second place behind Martin Pipe in the trainers' list with 35
successes, achieved at a strike-rate of 39%.
Two of those victories have been gained by Charged, and the
six-year-old gelding looks still to feature on a favourable mark.
He got off the mark over fences two outings ago when winning an
amateurs' event at Fontwell, making much of the running to beat My Senor
by 15 lengths.
He was not so impressive in following up that success but showed
courage in his defeat of Coole Dodger at Wincanton.
Given a more conservative ride on this occasion, he went to the front
at the final fence and stayed on under pressure to win by a neck.
The third horse was 11 lengths in arrears that afternoon so the form
looks sound enough, and it is also likely that a return to more
aggressive tactics will see Charged to better effect.
Today's three-mile trip will suit him and Charged is taken to complete
a hat trick.
Jathib can gain due reward for his consistency by winning his second
race of the season in the Dennis Publishing Hurdle.
He got his campaign off to a fine start with a victory at Newton Abbot
in August and, although he was a little below par at Market Rasen behind
Moobakkr -- who reopposes -- his two subsequent seconds at Cheltenham
and Newbury make fair reading.
He went under by a length to the progressive Great Marquess last time,
just unable to summon a change of pace in the closing stages, and is
taken to go one better here.
Haydock's card has cut up badly, with the seven races attracting just
33 runners.
Mary Reveley's Mill Thyme should be able to get off the mark first
time of asking in the opening Birchfield Juvenile Novices' Hurdle.
* SHAHID and Ihtiram have left John Dunlop's stable en route to Dubai,
the latest of the exodus of British-trained horses bound for the Middle
East.
Angus Gold, owner Sheikh Hamdan's racing manager, said the pair are

IDID NOT enjoy my tour of Scotland. It seems to be Jekyll and Hyde
country when it comes to tourism -- the scenery is beyond belief, and in
my book ranks alongside the Rockies, the best of the Alps, even the
Himalayas. But too often my spirits soared with the sheer unadulterated
beauty of the place, only to have them plummet as I approached a town or
village seeking a bed for the night.
As a frequent judge of the Hotel and Tourism of the Year awards, I can
objectively state that most of the hotels I either saw or stayed in fell
far short of modern tourist requirements. No doubt in the #150-#200 a
night bracket there are fine and worthy (and some incredibly
pretentious) establishments.
Holidaymakers I met also praised the #15-#17 a night bed and
breakfasts as good value for money.
But at #42, a single cell without WC or shower is no longer acceptable
to tourists long used even to one or two-star Spanish hotels offering
full facilities.
The lack of telephones in every hotel I stayed in was staggering.
Bathrooms, WCs and telephones are not luxuries, but essentials for
modern tourism.
''I don't think they've really caught on to tourism here,'' remarked a
continental traveller, not unkindly. ''Even in the Czech Republic they
offer toiletries such as shower gel and shampoo; here all you get is a
wafer-thin sliver of soap, and I've been paying over #50 a night.''
Holidaymakers only want to know about value, not the problems of the
host country. Their holiday funds are finite.
Apart from the weather, the expense and lack of facilities of the
hotels they saw were their biggest complaints, and few could understand
the proliferation of Stars, Rosettes, Crowns, Inspected, Recommended and
Approved ratings, whoever granted them.
Food ranked low, particularly with continental visitors, who
highlighted high prices of hotel dining rooms -- mini disaster areas.
Another, this time English, visitor remarked that since Mallaig seemed
to be swimming with fish, why could he only find it in batter?
The only vegetables served up were chips, peas, carrots -- frozen
broccoli was the most exotic. (None of these criticisms apply to the
major cities, where the facilities have been honed by business as well
as local demands.)
On the subject of service, I found waitresses and the lower paid
naturally friendly, helpful and courteous. But the higher up the pay
scale, the worse it became. Maybe ''Have a nice day'' American-style
would be incongruous, but a smile and a ''hello'', and particularly a
''goodbye'', would be a start.
No doubt holidaymakers can be a pain, but they are also bread, butter,
and jam. I often felt in Scotland that it was the tourists who were
supposed to adapt, and not the so-called hosts.
As the owner of a ton of leaflets and brochures on Scottish holiday
attractions (though too many are shut in the autumn, and particularly on
Sundays), I found the best attractions were those run by the National
Trust for Scotland; I came to dread the so-called ''woollen mills''
where they milled nothing, the ''distilleries'' described as a ''living
museum''. And I seriously wonder whether Scottish heritage and history
should be trivialised into Scottish kitsch.
I also wondered whether most visitors to Scotland really want an
overdose of Scottish history and visits to memorials to the nation's
past sufferings -- I'm not aware that the French blitz us with Joan of
Arc, the Austrians with the Hapsburgs, the Americans with Gettysburg and
the Australians with slave ships. History, yes; culture, yes; but not
tartan and thistle for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Finally, a major grouse about the Scottish Tourist Board.
Both London and Edinburgh were anxious to tell me that ''We don't sell
holidays,'' accenting the ''sell'' as if it were a dirty word.
Yet when I visited their huge and expensive Trafalgar Square office,
with a leaping salmon, half a dozen empty Scotch bottles and a lobster
trap in the window, there was Thomas Cooks as part of their office,
ready, willing and able to do all the selling in the world.
I found them short on ideas, and somehow uninterested in what I
wanted. Brochures they have galore, but I wonder if they should be
merely literature distribution depots.
Tourism is no longer a candy floss industry; in Britain it generates
#36bn a year, employs more than 1.5 million people and it is estimated
that by the year 2000 it will be the world's largest industry.
If Scotland, with its staggering natural assets, wants to maintain,
let alone increase, its share it needs a radical rethink of what the
tourist, both from abroad and the rest of Britain, really seeks.
And please -- don't shoot the messenger!

RICHARD Hannon took the training honours at Redcar yesterday where
landed a 69-1 treble. The former champion trainer has been enjoying a
great run in the closing weeks of the season, and he kept up the
momentum with the victories of Fairy Knight, Daunting Destiny, and Bunty
Boo.
Hannon's apprentice Dane O'Neill has played an important role in the
success and he was on board the last two winners.
After John Reid had kicked home Fairy Knight in the Poplar Handicap,
it was the turn of O'Neill to display his talents. He showed
determination in a tight finish to get Daunting Destiny home from Jerry
Cutrona in the nursery.
O'Neill took his tally to the season to 33 when guiding Bunty Boo.

DESERT Orchid has taken to the hunting field, four years after having
retired from steeplechasing. The 16-year-old has joined the Sinnington
Hunt at Barton-le-Street, North Yorkshire.
He was partnered by Jeannie Brown, a National Hunt handler who often
looks after the horse when he travels north. ''He looks quite small but
he's all power and until you actually sit on him you don't know that
he's very different from other horses,'' said Brown.
Desert Orchid won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1989 and the King George
VI Chase at Kempton a record four times.
A spokesman for the British Field Sports Society said: ''Many
ex-racehorses and other competitive horses enjoy hunting as a pastime in
their active retirement, and Desert Orchid is doing what his mother and
several forbears did in their lives.''

THE Smithfield FarmTech Show, which will be held at Earls Court,
London, at the end of this month, has attracted 851 entries for the
stock and carcass competitons, writes ROBERT ROSS.
''We are substantially over-subscribed by about 130 cattle, which
reflects the importance of show competitions,'' said David Child,
secretary of the Royal Smithfield Club, organiser of the stock section.
The three-day event will run from Sunday, November 26 in the four-acre
Earls Court Two exhibition centre.
Smithfield FarmTech was born out of the decision to stage the
prestigious Royal Smithfield Show, which has a strong emphasis on farm
machinery, in alternate years. Research among farmers showed there was
still a demand for an annual show and Smithfield FarmTech was created
with sponsorship from Farmers' Weekly magazine.
Show chairman and president of the Royal Smithfield Club, Jim Stobo
said: ''For the stock exhibitor the breeding cycle necessitates an
annual show -- and to be able to maintain the Earls Court and Royal
Smithfield Club association is extremely desirable.''
Specialist areas where farmers can go for advice on subjects such as
farm equipment, cereals and production of beef and lamb for the table
are being introduced.
One of the major Scottish participants will be Macphie of Glenbervie,
which has established a pedigree Aberdeen-Angus herd based on 200
breeding cows.
A new Macphie subsidiary, Glenbervie Aberdeen-Angus, is constructing a
butchery unit exclusively for Aberdeen-Angus products. Facilities for
hanging beef, primary cutting and added-value products will be used by
the Glenbervie enterprise as well as a significant proportion of cattle
from other farms.
The main market for the butchery unit will be the top end of the
catering trade in London, Paris and Brussels. In their Smithfield
demonstration Glenbervie staff will take visitors through the control
points from the breeding of the calf and the all-important natural diet
created with the help of the Rowett Research Institute to the final
stages of slaughtering, hanging and the provision of Continental cuts.
Macphie, a long-established supplier of mixes to the bakery and other
food manufacturing industries, will also be demonstrating added-value
meat products which can be created from the less expensive cuts.

BRITAIN'S second largest property group, MEPC, is turning its back on
Europe and will concentrate its overseas expansion in the US and
Australia. To that end, it yesterday agreed to buy the unquoted North
American Property Unit Trust investment vehicle in America for a total
of #186m made up of a payment of #84m and the taking on of borrowings of
#102m..
The unit trust is a mechanism through which British pension funds and
other investors have pooled property investments in the US. These
include enclosed regional shopping malls in Jacksonville, Florida,
Bakersfield, California, and San Antonio, Texas, and also the open-air
Riverlands Shopping Centre at La Place, Louisiana. In addition, there is
a 75% interest in the freehold of the Graybar Building which is a
30-storey office block next to Grand Central Station in New York.
It is expected that the deal will be earnings enhancing in the current
financial year to September 1996 as well as having a neutral effect on
net asset value.
The payment is expected to be satisfied through the issue of 14
million new MEPC shares at 379p and about #32m cash.
The existing shares rose 10p to 373p.
On completion, MEPC will have 17% of its assets in the US and 37% in
retail -- the best known US investment is probably the Northridge
shopping centre in Los Angeles which was damaged in the 1994 earthquake
but was recently re-opened in full.
In the 1993-94 financial year, MEPC received #15.3m of gross rental
income from Europe out of a total of #347m -- the 1994-95 figures are
due at the end of this month. These were derived from assets of #167m or
5% of the total portfolio. Australia is about 9%.
MEPC chief executive James Tuckey said the group's European operations
had performed well but he believed there were better opportunities in
the US and Australia.
There are some prime assets in Europe and he expects in due course to
realise their full value.
His comments are backed up by a recent survey by property consultants
Healey &amp; Baker. That pointed out that Paris prime office rents had
fallen by 15.6% in the year to June and although they are becoming a
more sought after investment commodity, the market is still very much in
it early stages of recovery.

<HEADLINE>2000 members of Lloyd's syndicate celebrate a landmark court victory and now aim for #2.8bn pot. The winners in the Name game</HEADLINE>

A GROUP of members of Lloyd's of London has won what is considered to
be a landmark victory in a court case against their underwriting agent
which may lead to a compensation payment of some #300m.
The 2000 members or names who had participated in the Merrett
Syndicate had sued the underwriter and the auditor for the syndicate for
losses they sustained.
In a judgment handed down at the High Court in London by Mr Justice
Cresswell all the defendants were found liable of negligence,
incompetence, and dereliction of duty.
''This is a stunning victory,'' declared John Mays, chairman of the
Merrett Syndicate 418 (1985) Names Association.
''If we had written the judgment ourselves, I don't think we could
have come up with a better one.''
''This is a magnificent justification for the association for all the
time, trouble, effort and money that we have expended and it is, I
believe, a triumphant conclusion to four years of dedicated work,'' said
Mr Mays.
''This judgment facilitates a settlement because it brings the
auditors into the picture and they will now be able to join in the
settlement package.
''I believe they will have to join in the negotiations and they will
contribute to the #2.8bn pot''
The auditors criticised were Ernst &amp; Whinney, now Ernst &amp; Young, but
the accountancy firm said it would appeal against the judgment.
Nick Land, senior partner of the firm, commented: ''In the unlikely
event of an appeal failing, the Names should take no comfort from the
widely exaggerated figures which have recently been reported in the
press. Any reasonable assessment is likely to put the contribution below
#20m.''
He added: ''We remain firmly of the view that the standards to which
we were auditing at the time were at the leading edge of the market.''
Ernst &amp; Young UK managing partner Andrew Jones said he believed the
appeal process could take up to two years.
Mr Cresswell was particularly critical of Stephen Merrett, the active
underwriter for the syndicate, who is a former deputy chairman of
Lloyd's and was a member of its ruling council for many years.
The judge said: ''I regret to say that I have serious reservations
about many aspects of Mr Merrett's evidence and serious reservations
about his approach as underwriter to 418/417.''
He added that a letter and reports in one set of accounts ''contain a
mixture of truth, half-truth, and falsehood''.
The case was one of a number going through the courts. Last week
another important judgment was made when the High Court ruled that the
insurance market's ''pay now, sue later'' provisions affecting names was
valid.
The rule obliges names to pay losses first and take up any
counterclaims later.
The ruling is likely to pave the way for Lloyd's to sue thousands of
members who have not paid up for past losses.
Another group of names has started legal action against solicitors
over the advice given to management agents.
It is thought the judgment in the Merrett case will put further
pressure on auditors, agents, and others involved in the running of
syndicates to contribute towards the #2800m settlement which Lloyd's
hopes to secure with its disgruntled names.
The plan would bring to an end the tangled litigation surrounding the
market. Names are holding out for a higher sum, with Mr Mays considering
another #1000m will be necessary.
He said: ''If it's less, it's going to be tough.''

<HEADLINE>Pilkington to raise #303m as profits jump 70%</HEADLINE>

PILKINGTON is set to raise #303m from a rights issue to fund
acquisitions on the back of a big jump in first-half profits.
The one-for-four issue is pitched at 155p a share, which with
Pilkington shares 7p up at 189p indicates an ex-rights price of 182p.
The main acquisition is the other half share in a fast growing Italian
glassmaker SIV. This will cost #120m and the purchaser will also absorb
its debt of #68m.
Pilkington's profits for the six months to September jumped by 70% to
#104m. Chairman Nigel Rudd yesterday attributed the performance to the
benefits of the more focused approach the group has taken in recent
years. The group raised the interim dividend 17% to 1.75p, though this
still leaves it well short of the peak seen in the early 1990s.
Pilkington has realised some #300m in non-core disposals since 1992
and still has a few peripheral activities to get rid of. It bought a
half-share in SIV in 1993. The company is a leading supplier to
Continental European automotive and building markets and the purchase is
expected to be earnings enhancing in its first year.
SIV's profits have exceeded Pilkington's expectations, in the six
months to June making #24m on sales of #167m. In the whole of 1994 it
made #15m. Margins are higher than in the group's other plants.
The second purchase is the European glass processing and distribution
business of the Interpane Group which will cost #55m. This will take
Pilkington into Switzerland for the first time and give it more exposure
in Denmark and Norway. The business makes double glazing units and
toughened glass. The group says it will provide further outlets for its
growing range of value added products.
The rest of the rights money is earmarked for investment in less
developed markets such as Latin America, Poland, China and India. The
group is following its automotive customers who are expanding in these
areas.
Pilkington's first-half results benefited from the first price rises
for several years. There was a net gain of 3% and volume was also ahead,
by 2% overall. European operations saw a good recovery in margins
following cost-cutting, while North America held up well despite softer
car markets and some restructuring.
Results from Australia and Argentina fell short of last year because
of their slowing economies, but Brazil performed strongly. The Barr &amp;
Stroud defence business, half-owned with Thomson of France, is currently
trading quite well.
One of Pilkington's aims is the reduction of debt and gearing by the
end of September was down to 59% from 66% a year earlier.
Mr Rudd is confident of further profits progess.

RACISM is rife in the National Health Service, a major study claims
today.
As many as one in four black and Asian nurses -- about 8% of all NHS
nursing staff -- reported they had been denied opportunities because of
their colour. They also reported widespread racial harassment and
discrimination.
The study by the independent Policy Studies Institute involved 14,000
NHS staff, case studies of six employers, and 150 interviews.
''Reports of racial harassment by patients were widespread,'' the
study says, adding: ''It was also fairly common for nursing staff from
ethnic minority groups to be subjected to racial harassment from
colleagues or managers.
''Nurses did not think that management was doing enough about these
problems; and they felt they were forced to accept it as part of the
job.''
Black nurses were less likely than white nursing staff of a similar
age to hold senior posts. It was found it could take them five years
longer to be promoted to higher grades.
Mr Malcolm Wing, deputy head of health for Unison, said the study
revealed a ''shameful catalogue'' of discrimination.
He added that it confirmed the union's view that equal opportunities
policies were ''just words on paper''. He continued: ''It's a scandal
that racism is still experienced and expected as part of the job.''
The study recommends ethnic monitoring; Mr Wing called for an
immediate action programme involving the health unions.

WITH the ink hardly dry on ScottishPower's acquisition of Manweb, the
Scottish utility is losing its director of corporate communications,
Colin Liddell, who is leaving to set up his own Glasgow-based
consultancy.
Mr Liddell will be joined in the new venture by senior colleague
Lesley Thomson, who is currently overseeing Manweb's PR operation in
Chester. Mr Liddell will be replaced by Sue Clark, currently in charge
of ScottishPower's investor relations, who is expanding her remit.
With most staff at Atlantic Quay and elsewhere in ScottishPower still
to be told formally of the departures, Mr Liddell was constrained in
what he felt able to say last night.
But he did insist that the parting is amicable and that he will
continue to work for ScottishPower on a consultancy basis. ''I will help
in the transition and continue to work for the team,'' he told The
Herald.
His new business, which has been in prospect for some months, should
be up and running by the New Year. It will, he said, focus on tactical
and strategic communications for a small number of blue-chip clients
rather than pitch for general PR work.
It is known that the first year of Mr Liddell's two-and-a-half-year
stint with the power utility was a somewhat bumpy ride. But things
appeared to have settled down with the arrival of new chief executive
Ian Robinson last March.
That said, Mr Liddell's desire to leave and start his own business was
growing and a final decision may have been interrupted by the surprise
summer bid for Manweb.
Mr Liddell, 48, has worked in in-house corporate affairs since 1986,
originally trained as a journalist, first with local papers in Falkirk,
then with the Edinburgh Evening News.
He then spent nearly five years in the press office of the Scottish
Development Agency, before leaving to head up the PR division of Charles
Barker Scotland.
As chief executive of Barkers, he became deeply involved in the
Guinness takeover of Distillers and, after the bid succeeded, went off
to work for the new United Distillers, first as a consultant, then from
1988, as head of corporate affairs.
There he formed close links with the UD chairman Lord Macfarlane,
until being headhunted by ScottishPower's chairman Murray Stuart. Mr
Liddell serves on the Scottish advisory board of Barclays Bank.
* COLIN Liddell's departure from ScottishPower will coincide with
arrival of the Royal Bank of Scotland's new director of corporate
affairs, another ex-SDA man, Howard Moody.
Mr Moody, currently helping to run CzechInvest, the Prague-based
inward investment arm of the Government of the Czech Republic, takes up
that long vacant post in January.

EUROTUNNEL appears to have suffered a major blow after the
International Chamber of Commerce rejected a #2300m claim against the
British and French railways. The ICC had been brought in as arbitrator
as had been agreed by both sides in the event of dispute.
The claim was based on the higher costs Eurotunnel had incurred
arising from the late entry into service of the Eurostar high-speed
train service between London and Paris.
However, the ICC panel said independent experts would be appointed to
investigate Eurotunnel's secondary claims against the railways.
These include claims for compensation for late delivery of rolling
stock and lack of capacity provided by British Rail.
Eurotunnel's total debt amounts to #8450m.

The mill trail goes cold and even hi-tech heroes fail to stir the
blood
THERE seemed to be only three things to do in Fort William on a
blustery autumn Sunday -- climb Ben Nevis, visit the Treasures of the
Earth exhibition, or queue at the Tourist Information Centre.
I didn't feel well enough equipped for the climb. I did spend the odd
hour in Treasures of the Earth, paying a not unreasonable #2.50, and in
King Solomon's Mines, which was a souvenir shop . . . Oh, and I did stop
at the Ben Nevis Woollen Mills at the town's outskirts, which seemed to
have attracted a number of coaches.
And not a loom in sight.
I wandered among avenues of Shetland knitwear and expensive Pringle
clothing in this, yet another souvenir shop.
''Do you have a mill around here?'' I asked a shop assistant as she
was reorganising the Fair Isles. ''Oh no,'' she replied, ''they come
from Edinburgh.''
Still, at least it wasn't Taiwan, and I didn't have to pay an entrance
fee.
So, back to the Tourist Information Centre, joining a queue of
visitors -- there were lots of them, of all nationalities, and many a
destination would give its eye teeth for so many at the end of
September.
When I eventually got to the counter, the friendly lady tore off a
sheet of attractions around Fort William.
''Unfortunately most of them are closed today,'' she apologised. The
list included, alas, the West Highland Museum, of which I had heard
much, and which, judging by the number of frustrated visitors could at
least have postponed its Sunday closing until the end of October.
Was there any information about Glencoe? No, but I'd find some when I
got there. (Predictably the Information Centre was already shut when I
got there.)
Did they have any accommodation booklets for the Trossachs? No.
How long would it take me, driving slowly to get to Callander or
Stirling, by way of Glencoe and Rannoch Moor? About one and a half
hours, she assured me, apologising for the lack of information.
I walked up and down the short but pleasant enough traffic-free Fort
William High Street, had a cup of tea in a fish and chip shop decorated
with Grecian urns and Regency swags, and decided to press on.
Fort William, with a captive tourist market due to its position as a
road and rail centre ought to be a real gem -- the Montreux of Scotland.
It is framed by Ben Nevis on one side, and a beautiful loch on the
other. But with its ugly road system, and its lakeside phalanx of guest
houses it is hardly the place I would choose to hole up in and write my
Hotel du Lac, let alone seek a dalliance a la Anita Brookner.
In moments of adversity, you tend to find others who too have
suffered: ''You pay #50 for a room, and you don't expect to have to
search for the shower at the end of the corridor,'' said one disgruntled
Turk who lived in London, but was showing his parents the highlights of
the UK.
''I had some German visitors who really wanted something special; so I
rang a friend at the Tourist Office in Fort William,'' a hotelier from
the Trossachs told me, ''and he admitted that there was nowhere --
they'd have to stay out of town. The town hotels have been taken over by
the Wally Arnold coach tour jobs (sic), they don't pay anything like the
advertised rates, but individual travellers get caught by them.''
It was early Sunday evening, and Glencoe was absolutely magnificient
-- perhaps the best yet. Everything was closed, so it was quite a relief
to miss all the guts and gore of the Glencoe Massacre this time, and
concentrate on the glories around me.
Further on, evening shadows intensified the stark desolation of
Rannoch Moor -- heady stuff indeed. When it came to the distribution of
scenery in the British Isles, Scotland certainly hogged the best bits.
Unfortunately it was getting too late to linger -- the one and a half
hour estimate by the part-timer at the Tourist Office might have been
just about possible for David Coulthard on a good day, but not for a
mere meandering tourist. Large chunks of the bliss around me were
ignored as I hurried past, mindful of the fiasco in finding a bed the
previous night.
But on this, my third night in Scotland, I struck lucky. I couldn't
make Stirling, or even Callander, but just off the road at Ballquhidder,
a little white inn, the King's House, looked inviting, despite the Rob
Roy Tryst Gift Shop and Rob Roy Bar attached.
I knew I was in luck when the man behind the desk offered to help me
with my bags. The room I was shown was warm, pretty and chintzy, with
shower, WC and TV. There was a view across a road to the valley. There
was even a carafe of sherry, which I immediately plundered.
But best of all, my room cost only #20. True, there was no phone in
it, though there was a rather public one in the Rob Roy bar, and a more
discreet public phone box across the road.
The dining room was the cosiest yet, but I still found the prices of
#8 for pork chops, #10 for lemon sole, #7.50 for chicken, preceeded by
an hors d'oeuvre of garlic mushrooms for #2.50, or smoked salmon for
#5.50, somewhat steep. So I repaired to the Rob Roy Bar for a Beef
Madras and chips, and had my most convivial evening yet.
My previous experience of most Scottish pubs is that you go there for
the serious business of drinking, not talking.
The Rob Roy, with its tartan clad seats and curtains, etchings of
kilted laddies, the fire and the Great Dane taking up most of the room
had more of the atmosphere of an English Inn.
But it was the sex of PC Rowan's baby that broke the ice.
The BBC TV soap Heartbeat was on the telly. ''I've heard that that's
his real baby,'' offered the barmaid conversationally, ''but that it's
actually a boy.''
And if this relevation didn't exactly open the floodgates, at least
the assembled company of about six exchanged a few words about the Ryder
Cup, the Grand Prix and the football scores.
The next morning, the last of the visit, I rifled among the well
displayed array of local attraction brochures displayed in the hotel. I
fancied the idea of the Falls of Dochart, until I read of the ''fairies
and kelpies'' with a promise of video animation at the Breadalbane
Folklore Centre.
I'd had my fill of woollen mills and whisky distilleries, and I was
put off too, probably wrongly by the description of the 360 degree
diorama at Stirling's Wallace Monument, where I could learn its history
''through an imaginative words-and-pictures presentation''.
The best history lesson I had was from the proprietor of the King's
House, a Glaswegian who explained the story of the former drover's inn,
the local feuds, and tales of the Trossachs he so loved with a knowledge
and an enthusiam that are worth a thousand audio-visuals.
He directed me to the peaceful little Balquhidder Church with its
graves of the McLarens and the Macgregors whose past he brought so
vividly to life -- a bit of real magic.
I pursued Rob Roy as far as Callander, where he now rates his own
exhibition at the Visitor Centre, currently displaying Sir Walter
Scott's Penguin version as a Special Bargain of #1. ''The book that
Inspired the Film'' -- cost #5.99 -- Sic transit gloria.
For the presentation, about 20 of us filed into a darkened theatre for
our Rob Roy Experience.
Who was Rob Roy? Who indeed! At either side of the screen two figures
appeared from time to time. The one that didn't move, I soon discovered,
was Daniel Defoe.
The other, I realised halfway through the performance, was the aged
Rob Roy himself, talking to his wife -- or was it his daughter, I never
found out -- as his lips remained firmly closed, but his neck swivelled
a fantastic 180 degrees like a demented metronome with every utterance.
In the middle, on the main screen, a series of images, no doubt in the
cause of artistry, were flashed up, usually out of focus, against a
background of (a) tartan, (b) a candle, (c) waterfalls. At any one time
a piper, blue berets (who they?), lots of swords and some rather nice
shaggy Highland cattle appeared as if by magic, imposed over the said
tartan, candles etc -- sometimes the screen showed the lot.
The sound effects and the dialogue were equally dramatic, and just as
baffling to those of us who haven't yet seen the recent movie --
probably 90% of the audience.
Lots of horses whinnying and swords clashing, a repetitive ''Aagh,
Aagh,'' hollow laughter when ''peace'' was mentioned and ''Montrose!
Montrose!'' (six times in all).
There was a whole mystifying sequence of ''we ran, they ran, we ran''
(where, you might ask?)
A series of coughs, with several visitations from the piper ''I hear
the piper'' (cough, cough) ''the piper is coming, Rob'' . . . ''The
piper is there, Rob'' . . . heralded the denouement.
''Who was I?'' Rob Roy gasped (well, if he didn't know, it wasn't
surprising that we didn't either).
As the credits rolled, the audience filed out dutifully. ''A bit
loud'', a couple of old ladies muttered to each other. ''I'm afraid we
find your language a bit difficult to understand,'' a French woman said
to me, assuming that I was Scottish.
The children thought it OK, but bits of it rather boring. An English
couple who had seen the film enjoyed it.
And my reaction? The best #2's worth of the whole trip, for all the
wrong reasons.
It was time to go. I took the scenic route through the Trossachs,
which even mist and rain couldn't spoil, and at around 3pm I arrived at
Glasgow Airport, where I had the best lunch -- of coffee and sandwiches
-- of my visit.

A MEAT industry leader hit back yesterday at critics of its latest
advertising campaign designed to boost meat's image as a healthy food.
The campaign is under attack from vegetarians, the fish industry --
both farmed and caught -- and others who have referred it to the
Advertising Standards Authority.
But Don Curry, chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission which is
financing the #2m campaign, is unrepentant. ''The red meat industry is
on the offensive,'' he said at an industry awards event in London
yesterday.
''No apologies, no defensive statements, no standing on the back foot.
We are extolling the real nutritional benefits of meat. We are proud of
our products.''
The industry is of key economic importance, he said, with British
consumers spending around #14bn a year on meat and meat products both
within and outside the home. It is also a major employer providing more
than 650,000 jobs directly with a further 300,000 in related areas.
British beef is exported to 93 countries outside Europe and the total
value of meat and livestock exports in the current year is expected to
reach #1300m -- equivalent to more than #7000 for each livestock farm in
the country.
''The pervasive influence of the livestock sector is not confined to
its substantial contribution to the economic well-being of the
countryside and its balance of payments,'' said Mr Curry.
''More than two-thirds of the agricultural land area of the UK is
covered in grass of which almost half is designated as rough grazing.
This unique landscape, this countryside, this rural environment, this
rural economy is largely the product of our livestock industry.''
He also took a bullish line on overseas competition. Britain now leads
the world in pig breeding and has a real edge with its beef, he said.
This will enable us to compete with anywhere in the world once the
export door reopens following the BSE scare, he added. Britain has the
potential to displace New Zealand as the leading supplier of sheep meat,
and the development of welfare friendly veal has created a product which
can compete with Dutch and French supplies.
''We are not apologetic. Quite the reverse. We are proud of the
contribution that the livestock and meat sector makes to the British
economy and the country. It is a multi-billion pound industry employing
and supporting the jobs of over a million people in this country,'' Mr
Curry said.
Scottish livestock producers did not win any top awards yesterday. But
among the highly commended were beef producer Alan Lyburn of Gormack,
Blairgowrie, winner of this year's Scottish Livestock Farmer of the Year
Award, and sheep producer David Soutar of Dryburn Farm, Strathmore
Farming Co, Glamis, near Forfar.
Dr Jane Guise of Cambac Research, who received the David Black Award
for services to the pig industry, said there were a few widespread
misconceptions about animal transport. Farmers, their suppliers and
customers were urged to provide the facts to British policy makers so
that European rules did not force these misconceptions through into
national law.
A call for a more unified industry approach to provide objective input
to the European legislative process was also made by Luc Batel, chief
executive of ADM, a major meat group in South-east England. He warned
that the industry is in danger of seeing its farming base eroded, which
could lead to beef becoming too expensive for consumers.

INVESTMENT capital group 3i yesterday announced it was ploughing more
money into the Nevis Range Development Company's Aonach Mor ski resort.
3i, which first invested in the company when it was formed seven years
ago, has provided another #300,000 to help finance the opening of a
major new ski area adjoining the existing slopes at Aonach Mor.
In all, Nevis Range has raised nearly #1m for its latest expansion.
Grants have come from the European Development Fund and local enterprise
company Lochaber Limited.
Since it was formed, Nevis Range has invested #11.5m in the Aonach Mor
resort, which attracted more than 90,000 visitors last winter and is
also a magnet for the thousands of tourists who visit Fort William
during the summer.
The Nevis Range area, which falls from more than 4000 feet to sea
level near Loch Linnhe, has an access gondola and numerous ski-tows and
chairlifts, as well as a restaurant, shop and ski school.
Nevis Range managing director Ian Sykes is delighted with the success
of Aonach Mor.
He said: ''The new investment will enable us to develop the adjoining
slopes of Corrie Dubh -- a sheltered bowl offering excellent skiing
which will double the choice of runs.''

WHEN in need of a relaunch what better vehicle to call on than an
historical drama. This revival of Robert Bolt's 25-year-old warhorse
that originally starred Eileen Atkins and Bolt's then wife, Sarah Miles,
marks the reopening of Sir Bernard Miles's popular Puddle Dock theatre
on the banks of the Thames.
Since his death, the theatre has languished dark and unloved and actor
Roy Marsden is clearly looking to the tried-and-tested in the hope of
breathing new life into the only theatre within the boundaries of the
City of London.
It may be false insurance if last week's reception is anything to go
by. Yet Vivat! Vivat! is neither as clumsy as some critics have
suggested nor as static as Marsden's production encourages. Even if less
politically astute than Schiller's Mary Stuart, it's still a finely
crafted, absorbing portrait of contrasting personalities caught in
history's grip. Bolt's Mary is spirited, sexually free while Elizabeth
feels forced to reluctant sacrifice of personal desires by the dictates
of duty (and hardly the escapee from life that Mary rather cruelly
describes).
Barbara Flynn and Janet McTeer as the two opposing queens, Barry
Stanton as her shrewd chancellor and Richard Heffer's thin-lipped
spy-catcher, Walsingham are also a joy in a play that reminds us of the
dodgy ways in which the United Kingdom came to be pieced together in the
first place.

WHAT would you do if you picked up #735,000 in used fifties on the
London Underground? Yup, Ray Cooney -- the last master of farce -- is
back with a new play, Funny Money, and you can tell you are in Ray
Cooney world from the moment the curtain goes up.
Henry and Jean Perkins live in an ordinary two-up, two-down in
Cooney-land. There is a staircase backstage, inner rooms stage left and
right, a front door, a back door and let's not forget the broom
cupboard. The cuckoo clock on the wall is stuck at half past one but to
all intents and purposes it hasn't moved since 1956.
The only way you can tell that Ray Cooney has noticed the years go by
is the lack of young women in the play and a passing reference to
Classic FM. The audience can also spot the gags 15 minutes before they
happen. A large red blanket provides a perfect excuse for hanky-panky.
Sister Adelaide coming from Sydney is obvious material for some
predictable wordplay.
Ray Cooney wrote, directs and stars in this show along with Sylvia
Syms, Charlie Drake and other farce regulars. Cooney's 30 years
experience in the genre means that though the ideas may be tired at
least when the plot spins out of control it all makes sense at the time.
To some devotees the very predictability of the play must be a delight.
For others the only relief is that no-one gets stuck in the broom
cupboard.

PILKINGTON has had its fair share of bad luck and uncertain management
in the past but it appears to have struck gold with its SIV purchase in
Italy, while chief executive Roger Leverton and chairman Nigel Rudd are
doing the right thing in consolidating the group's market position in
Europe.
SIV is being acquired on a single-figure exit multiple which makes it
a bargain given that it is one of Pilkington's most efficient plants and
is selling from a low-cost area into the huge German market. It is not
surprising that its margins, estimated at 13%, are well above the
European average for the industry of nearer 8%.
There is a good chance that they will be maintained. With SIV a full
subsidiary, Pilkington will be able to integrate it into its existing
European operations, allocating production on a more efficient basis, so
further benefits will come through.
The Interpane purchase looks a good deal also, giving Pilkington a
captive market for its glass plants. The business has a 46% share of the
downstream glass market in Scandinavia, which will be a willing buyer of
the group's high-margin energy saving glass. The deal also brings a
supply agreement for other Interpane companies in Germany and the US
which are not part of the actual purchase.
It is similar to the Heywood Williams acquisition in the UK, which
gave Pilkington an assured outlet for its float lines which have to keep
going continuously. It also helped increase sales of specialist glasses
which now account for 12% of total sales.
Pilkington's strength in European and American markets gives it a
solid base to expand internationally, in line with the globalisation of
the world's motor industry. These operations will gradually increase
their share of group sales as its main markets are mature and likely to
grow slowly.
The group's package was well received by analysts yesterday who
approve of the strategy being followed.
No surprise
IT would come as no surprise to those who have followed Body Shop
since its stockmarket listing if the group were to be taken back into
private ownership.
Much of the investment community finds it hard to understand companies
whose interest is not wholly centred on the bottom line and increasing
shareholder value. High-profile individuals who are associated with
their companies also often cause unease among investors.
Another maverick organisation, Richard Branson's Virgin group, had a
short life on the stockmarket before it was taken back into private
hands, with Mr Branson claiming that the City did not understand the
business.
Body Shop's founder, the dynamic Anita Roddick, has made no secret of
her contempt for the values of much of the City (and press for that
matter). Information on the company's social values and worldwide social
campaigning comes before hard financial data at any results meeting.
Ms Roddick has said that the responsibility of business is not to
achieve profits but to create live, vibrant, honourable organisations
with a real commitment to the community.
The Body Shop effectively created the mainstream UK cruelty-free
toiletries and cosmetics market. The superstore operators such as
Sainsbury along with chemist Boots have been quick to launch their own
''natural'' product ranges.
These larger groups with their hefty purchasing power have put
increasing pressure on Body Shop, which for a time appeared to be
complacent and became uncompetitive on price. Consumers still want value
for money whether the product is cruelty-free or not.
Along with other UK retailers Body Shop is facing problems in getting
its US retail offer right. Falling US sales have tended to overshadow
the group's strong growth in Asia.
Given the trading problems in the US and continuing pressure to get
its message over to sceptical City investors, who could blame the
Roddicks for wanting to take their company back and run it as they wish,
out of the glare of publicity?
War of words
SCOTTISH investors in Thames Water should warmly welcome the robust
rebuttal by chief executive Mike Hoffman of industry regulator Ian
Byatt's warning that the privatised water utilities have limited scope
for increasing their dividends, unless they are able to increase their
efficiency above what is allowed in the price limits.
Also Mr Byatt has no business to dictate what a company's dividend
policy should be nor can there be a windfall tax as there has been no
windfall. To change the present five-year pricing system to an annual
review would be disruptive to long-term planning as it would be
impossible to predict future cash flows.
But Mr Hoffman is speaking from a pretty strong position in that
Thames has the lowest customer bills of the 10 privatised companies at
an average of about #180 per household, 20% below the average, and so
customers have less ''right'' to any rebate than those of other water
companies.
Also Thames has the psychological advantage that even during the most
severe period of drought, supplies were not affected, apart from the odd
glitch, nor hosepipe bans imposed -- unlike in some parts of
unprivatised Scotland.
There is now the decided prospect of a sea change in sentiment in
favour of the utility which was everyone's whipping boy. That partly
reflects the implied promise that the hitherto unsatisfactory
international activities will start contributing to profits in perhaps
two years.
More important, there is now effectively a 7% annual increase in
profits built into the UK operations which will be matched by dividends.
The forecast is that the current year will see a 12% nominal rise in the
total to about 28p for a 6.6% yield. This should grow to well over 7%
next year, making it the most secure in the sector.
It will be achieved by reducing dividend cover to perhaps twice by
1999 with earnings held back by a near full-scale tax burden from next
April.
Thames now offers the best prospects in the sector.

WHEN a concert venue can be made to serve the needs of the music in a
special way the result can be unforgettable. This happened last Saturday
halfway through the Aberdeen Festival of Early Music.
Gregory Squire was playing first violin in Marini's Echo Sonata for
three violins when the sounds of Sarah Bevan-Baker and Kenneth Mitchell,
concealed in the darkness at either end of the rear gallery, created a
magical effect of limitless space in the dimly lit Chapel of King's
College.
Funding from Elf Enterprise for the quincentenary celebrations of the
university this year gave head of music Dr Roger Williams the chance to
bring two of the most prestigious names in early music to Aberdeen:
Joshua Rifkin leading the Bach Ensemble of Boston and Gothic Voices from
London.
Rifkin opened the festival with an all-Bach programme. Keeping the
best till last, he gave a dazzling performance at the harpsichord of a
concerto for harpsichord, two recorders and strings.
He took a back seat, however, as oboist Stephen Hammer with Linda Quan
on violin had everyone on the edge of their seats with their eloquent
dialogue in the C-minor Concerto for violin and oboe.
Audiences had another opportunity to hear this work on Sunday at the
second concert by Rifkin and the ensemble. The original programme was to
have featured three Bach Cantatas.
Soprano Susanne Ryden was struck down with an infection which
completely deprived her of her voice, but, following Bach's own practice
of making the best of what musical material was to hand, the other two
Chorales BWV55 and BWV157, which used the soprano only in the final
choruses, were performed in their entirety.
AT THE closing concert by Gothic Voices on Monday, Christopher Page
and his quartet flung wide a window on to a world of unsuspected musical
richness and variety.
This really was early music -- back to the time of Richard the
Lionheart and Blondel, one of whose songs really was performed. The
endlessly flowing melodies of the solo songs created a marvellous
atmosphere in the ancient cathedral, some parts of which go back even
further than the music.

CANADA
CANADIAN equities and money markets roared higher yesterday following
a narrow defeat for Quebec separatists in Monday night's referendum,
writes DOUGLAS HAMILTON.
Most of the action took place on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
country's leading equities market. The TSE-300 index closed about 80
points higher. The TSE's 14 sub-indices also posted impressive gains.
Against the American greenback, the Canadian dollar closed at 1.3445,
up from Monday's close of 1.3610.
In frenzied early trading, the Toronto market soared more than 100
points as bargain-hunters jumped in to snap up stocks. Canadian equities
also rose on Wall Street and the Canadian dollar recouped overnight
losses incurred when the Quebec nationalists took an early lead in the
referendum to decide whether the French-speaking province should leave
Canada.
''Everybody has been holding back and waiting for the referendum,''
said Ira Katzin, an investment adviser with Richardson Greenshields, a
Toronto brokerage house.
In the first 15 minutes of trading the TSE surged 131.89 points to
4511.65 on volume of more than 14 million shares.
Meanwhile, in Ottawa, Finance Minister Paul Martin said the federal
Government will ''stay the course'' on fiscal reforms and will focus on
job creation, growth, and reducing interest rates.

THE Government and Sinn Fein still were deadlocked last night over
Downing Street demands on IRA disarmament.
Three hours of talks -- the longest yet between the two sides -- at
Stormont last night failed to end the impasse which has effectively put
the Ulster peace process on hold.
Another meeting has been arranged for Friday.
The Government is resisting demands by Sinn Fein to set a date for the
start of all-party talks ahead of any agreement on a process which would
eventually lead to the IRA handing over their weapons.
Northern Ireland political development Minister Mr Michael Ancram said
progress had been made on certain aspects but confirmed that
difficulties remained.
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness said he regretted the impasse had not
been broken.
Mr McGuinness said: ''We had a detailed discussion. There are major
difficulties.''
The discussions centred on new Sinn Fein proposals to try to reach
some sort of agreement but it's clear a formula is still some way off.
The British, Irish and American governments have more or less agreed
proposals to set up an international arms commission to oversee a
disarmament process by the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.
In Washington yesterday, SDLP leader Mr John Hume, who had earlier
agreed the new proposals with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, urged
London to set a date for the start of talks.
However, Mr Ancram said the Government was not yet ready to begin the
twin-track approach.
He said: ''We made progress on certain issues. There are other
difficult issues which still need to be addressed. We discussed those in
some depth but we think it's important that we have a chance to return
to those issues reasonably soon.''
He said it had been a realistic and frank meeting, but it was
important to be clear with each other where they stood.''
He added: ''The best way to break the impasse is to adopt a twin-track
approach which allows us to approach the problems from a slightly
different perspective. In order to get the twin track up and running, we
obviously want to have an understanding on what there is to do and
today's meeting was largely about that.''

<TEXT>
A BULIMIA sufferer told a medical hearing yesterday how she had felt
betrayed when her confidential confessions of draining her own blood in
an effort to lose weight appeared in a newspaper and medical journal.
The woman, named only as Ms C, was at the time of the incident a
pre-registration doctor.
She told the General Medical Council in London that the articles in
the Journal of Psychiatry and the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal clearly
identified her to friends and had caused her great distress.
Ms C, now 30, said the article was written by two Aberdeen doctors she
hardly knew and was based on information apparently obtained from her
psychiatrist.
Ms C was giving evidence to the council's professional conduct
committee, where the authors of the journal article, consultant John
Eagles and registrar Jon Parkin and psychiatrist Alastair Palin, are
accused of serious professional misconduct.
All three were working at Royal Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen, at the
time of the alleged misconduct. Dr Palin had been responsible for her
psychiatric care from the time she moved to Aberdeen in 1990 until
January 1992.
An article in the Press &amp; Journal, apparently based on the journal
article, had been the first she had known of the fact that her medical
history was being used in this way.
''I was working in the pathology department of Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary when a colleague gave me an article with a front-page headline
and I read it.
''I went direct to the university medical school library and saw the
journal article. I was really very shocked, I was very angry, very upset
because of what was stated, because several of the things I knew were
not true and I basically could not believe what was said.''
She felt the article had been judgmental and a breach of her concept
of trust.
The committee went behind closed doors to hear further medical
evidence from Ms C.
Dr Eagles, of Binghill Park, Milltimber, Aberdeen, and Dr Parkin, now
of Noel Road, Islington, north London, admit submitting a paper
Bloodletting in Bulimia Nervosa to the journal for publication.
They both deny disclosing information relating to Ms C without
obtaining her informed consent and providing information in the paper
enabling Ms C to be identified.
Dr Palin, whose address was given as Royal Cornhill Hospital, denies
providing information to the other two doctors without obtaining
informed consent from Ms C.
Ms C added that she would have never consented to the disclosure of
information if she thought she would be identifiable.
Dr Neil Simpson, of Ashfield Road West, Aberdeen, a consultant at
Cornhill Day Hospital where Ms C had been a day patient, said: ''I had
no problems at all recognising her. The description was fairly unique to
her. In fact, I knew of the identities of all three patients.''
Dr Simpson said he had no knowledge of Ms C being asked to take part
in any research.
Earlier, in a sworn affidavit, an unnamed fellow medical student with
Ms C at Aberdeen University said she knew Ms C had tried to commit
suicide.
The hearing continues.

SOME peers are charging up to #2000 to hire out function rooms in the
House of Lords even though they can book the rooms for nothing, it is
claimed today.
Channel 4's Dispatches programme, to be broadcast tonight, also
alleges that some peers are prepared to table amendments to legislation
in return for cash payments.
The claims come as the Lords prepared to debate today the report of
the Griffiths Committee which has called for a tightening of the rules
governing peers' conduct.
The committee was set up after the Liberal Democrat Lord Lester of
Herne Hill alleged that four unnamed peers had accepted ''substantial
sums'' for tabling parliamentary questions to Ministers.
Leigh Mendelsohn, the chairman of the public affairs committee of the
Public Relations Consultants Association, told Dispatches she had been
offered the hire of a Lords room for #1000 by a peer -- half his normal

AND your specialist subject is landscape and literature 1750 to 1834.
OK, it doesn't sound like a bundle of laughs and actually it's not, but
there are enough to sustain Tom Stoppard's cleverness as an entertaining
evening at the theatre.
It requires a certain degree of knowledge of art and science to
dismiss them both as frivolous, but that is what Stoppard's Arcadia both
admires and displays. On the other hand, the engine of the first act is
a ''perpendicular poke'' as the author puts it -- a ''knee trembler'' to
most of us.
Stoppard may be ambivalent and even cynical about the value of
research, academe, inspiration, and the muse, but the architecture of
sexual congress is usually endorsed, even if only to further the plot.
On the evidence of last night's house it is at least debatable whether
there is a King's-size interest in this sort of theatre round these
parts. Which is a shame because there is much to enjoy, even if the
playwright, rather than director Gemma Bodinetz, is ultimately
responsible for the lack of emotional depth to characters that sparkle
verbally.
Not all the company in this touring version of the National Theatre
production quite rise to the challenges of the script, but the saturnine
Grant Thatcher as Septimus Hodge, Fiona Ramsay's Lady Croom, and Sharon
Maughan's Hannah Jarvis are still worth the price of the ticket, as much
as the craft of the writing.

<TEXT>
GLASGOW councillor Tommy Sheridan yesterday won his appeal against a
#750 fine imposed for his part in a protest against the M77 tree-felling
operations in Pollok Park.
Three appeal judges ruled that the fine imposed on Sheridan, Scottish
Militant Labour councillor for Pollok, was ''clearly excessive'' in the
circumstances and reduced it to #150, to be paid at #3 a week.
Sheridan was fined at Glasgow Sheriff Court on July 5 this year, after
being convicted of a breach of the peace on March 22. He was alleged to
have formed part of a disorderly crowd, and repeatedly pushed through a
cordon of police into a tree-felling area, shouting: ''Get the fence
back''.
Sheridan, 31, who argued his own case at the Justiciary Appeal Court,
in Edinburgh, pointed out that former Government Minister Allan Stewart
had been fined only #200 for a much more serious breach of the peace
involving the use of a weapon.
''The #750 fine imposed on me was excessive and verged on political
vindictiveness,'' Sheridan said.
He also pointed out that at the time the #750 fine was imposed he had
a disposable income of only #19 a week. He said that, although he was
allowed to pay the fine at #3 a week, this left him with a disposable
income of #10 a week. He told the court: ''It will take me beyond the
year 2000 to pay off this excessive #750 fine.''
He said that his protest did not involve any violence. At the time he
was concerned for the safety of other protesters and was asking for the
fence to be moved as a safety precaution.
He said he was representing the people of the area whose views and
protests about the tree-felling operations and road developments were
being ignored.
Lord Sutherland, sitting with Lords MacLean and Murray, after
listening to the 15-minute appeal, ruled in Sheridan's favour.
Lord Sutherland said the appeal court did not agree, however, that
there had been any ''political vindictiveness'' on the part of the
sheriff who imposed the original fine.
The judge added: ''We are satisfied that the fine of #750 which is
going to take five years to pay out of a disposable income of #19 a week
is clearly excessive. We shall quash the fine and impose one of #150, to
be paid at #3 a week.''
After the hearing Sheridan emerged smiling from the court. He said:
''I am very pleased that the fine was reduced. I cannot say that the
judges were politically vindictive.''
Sheridan said he was returning to the appeal court on Friday to
challenge a one-month jail sentence imposed on him at Greenock Sheriff
Court in August after he tried to prevent a poll tax poinding at the
house of a single mother.

THE Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, was urged in the Commons yesterday
to stop the #1m sale of the late Frederick West's ''so-called'' memoirs.
If he will not do that, MPs say he should order that the proceeds do
not go to members of the West family, as planned, but to the families of
the victims of the alleged murders.
Now a political storm threatens as a group of Tory back benchers table
a Commons motion, viewing the proposed sale ''of the so-called memoirs
with extreme distaste''.
The Prime Minister has already branded the deal, negotiated by the
Official Solicitor on behalf of the children of Frederick and Rosemary
West, as ''extremely distasteful''.
Mr Peter Harris, the Official Solicitor, acting on behalf of Frederick
West's estate, has commissioned a ''definitive'' account of the
Gloucester builder's life, drawing on statements he made to police and
an attempt that Mr West made at an autobiography before he was found
hanged in prison on New Year's Day.
Mr Douglas French,Tory MP for Gloucester, said: ''It is for the Lord
Chancellor to take the lead, if necessary overriding the judgment of the
Official Solicitor and stopping the memoirs from being sold, but at the
very least if they are sold, then the proceeds should go to the families
of the alleged victims.''
Mr French, who is meeting Lord Mackay tomorrow, added: ''I shall tell
the Lord Chancellor that the best interests of the Wests' children are
served by distancing them from these alleged crimes.
''If money is coming from this, the families of the victims are
worthier recipients than other members of the West family.''
* The Official Solicitor represents the interests of children, the
mentally ill, and anyone else deemed incapable of defending their legal
rights. He is appointed by the Lord Chancellor.

MUSICAL humour is a notoriously tricky and treacherous art, and the
Aberdeenshire composer, John Hearne, has not emerged unscathed from his
decision to write Bottom's Dream in response to a commission from the
Hebrides Ensemble, or to conceive it in terms of a ''burlesque'' for
trombone, soprano, and chamber group.
Yet in his interweaving of genial grotesquerie and luscious lyricism,
he has captured the essential elements of Shakespeare's tenderly comic
scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream, as last night's Edinburgh
performance -- the second of two this week -- for the most part made
engagingly clear.
The resourceful network of quotations from other composers, among whom
Mendelssohn was the most obvious star turn, certainly added to the
jollity. But with Irene Drummond as singer, the best moments lay in the
soaring, increasingly Straussian, lines of the soprano part.
In comparison, the trombone's robust portrayal of Bottom rather
outstayed its welcome, for all the virtuosity with which the
imperturbable John Kenny articulated the notes.
Thereafter, something tauter than Dvorak's delightful but prolix piano
quartet, Op 23, seemed required to bring a sense of purpose to the
second half of the programme, sympathetically though this was played.
But earlier, at least, Schnittke's first violin sonata -- a firecracker
of the 1960s, fizzingly rekindled -- had possessed the right
incisiveness, especially in a performance as pungent as the brilliant
young Andrew Haveron's, with Peter Evans as the percussive pianist.
Nevertheless, it was Janacek's fervent Pohadka, replacing a promised
new work by John Kenny, that was the evening's masterpiece, with William
Conway as the eloquent cellist.

Jury sees defendant stick to story under gruelling inquisition about
killings.
ROSEMARY West yesterday emphatically denied that she killed her
eight-year-old Scottish stepdaughter and kept her body hidden until her
husband could dispose of the remains when he was released from prison.
From that moment, Frederick and Rosemary West were tied together
forever, Mr Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, alleged at Winchester Crown
Court.
At the conclusion of a gruelling cross-examination, Mr Leveson
insisted that Rosemary West killed Charmaine, who disappeared in 1971
when aged eight.
''I would not have killed a little girl at that time,'' said Mrs West,
''or any time.''
Mr Leveson persisted: ''Was it an accident?''
''Certainly not sir. She did not die under my care,'' Mrs West
replied.
You abused that girl, didn't you? -- Not to the extent you suggest.''
She denied that she had tied Charmaine's arms behind her back and
secured her to a bed.
You killed her. -- No sir.
You kept her body for Fred to bury. -- No sir.
At this stage, Mrs West demanded to know where she could have kept the
body of that little girl.
Mr Leveson said there was a coal cellar at the flat in Midland Road,
Gloucester, where Charmaine's remains were unearthed last year.
''I was not aware of it,'' said Mrs West. ''I thought it was a vent.''
Mr Leveson indicated that a letter sent to West while in prison in
1971 proved that Charmaine died when he was in custody.
The Crown insists that Rosemary West was solely responsible for the
little girl's death.
Mrs West denies 10 counts of murdering young girls and women,
including Charmaine and her own daughter Heather.
Earlier, Mrs West had described her husband as the walking figure of
evil after being told he had admitted killing Heather.
''He never looked sorry for what he did,'' Mrs West told the jury.
''He just had a grin as if it were a joke or something.''
She had many opportunities to speak to her husband since he was
arrested for the killings at 25 Cromwell Street and elsewhere, but she
never took the opportunity.
She told Mr Richard Ferguson QC, defending, that she had no idea what
had happened to her daughter Heather.
Had she ever suspected that her husband might have killed her? -- No.
I didn't know he was a murderer, sir.''
Asked her reaction on being told Frederick West had admitted murdering
their daughter, Mrs West replied: ''I hated him. I could not believe I
could hate anybody so much.''
West committed suicide on New Year's Day while on remand.
Asked if she had been involved in the killings, Mrs West insisted: ''I
am not a murderer. I couldn't take someone's life away from them. I
would not like it done to me and I could not do it to anyone else.''
Mrs West insisted she could never have lived with anyone knowing that
they had killed.
''I would never have known when it was my turn,'' she told the court.
Earlier, Mr Ferguson asked about various victims, beginning with Ms
Shirley Robinson, who was made pregnant by Fred West. A foetal skeleton
with a gestation period of eight-and-a-half-months was found with her
remains.
Yesterday, Mrs West insisted that she had no idea that Ms Robinson was
carrying her husband's baby when she disappeared.
Had she suspected that the baby was going to be West's, she would have
asked Ms Robinson to leave her home.
''I'd no need to harm Shirley whatsoever,'' Mrs West told the jury.
She never had had a lesbian relationship with her, nor had Ms Robinson
shared a room with Mrs West and Frederick West.
She was told by her husband that Ms Robinson had left to go and live
in Germany. She never thought anything more about it.
Asked about the evidence of Miss A, who had told the court she had
been sexually assaulted by Mrs West and her husband, the accused
insisted that she had never met that girl.
''There is no truth in what she said whatsoever,'' said Mrs West ''it
never happened.''
If it had, why had Miss A kept silent, she asked counsel. ''She was
getting married at the time and she didn't tell anyone. She didn't tell
her fiance,'' she added.
Mrs West was shown a photograph of another victim, Ms Alison Chambers.
She said she had never ever seen that young woman.
Asked about her daugher Heather, Mrs West described the evening before
her disappearance.
Heather was determined to leave home but cried that night because a
job she had expected in Devon had fallen through at the last moment.
''I felt sorry for her,'' said Mrs West. ''It was the first thing she
had taken an interest in since she left school.''
According to Mrs West, her husband told her to go out shopping the
next day. When she came back three hours later, Heather had gone.
West told her that women in a mini had picked her up to take her to
Devon.
''Next day, Fred appeared to be rather coy and was making excuses,''
she said.
It seemed silly now, Mrs West told the court, that she did believe on
one occasion she had spoken to Heather on the telephone.
West had passed the receiver to her. It was a young girl's voice on
the other end and she thought it was Heather. It was very blurred and
there was heavy background noise from a public house or a club.
The jury has been told that, by then, Heather was dead and her remains
interred under the patio at 25 Cromwell Street.
Of her stepdaughter Anne Marie Davis, who had given evidence, Mrs West
said she had no idea her husband had been sexually abusing her from the
age of eight. She denied that she had sexually abused or assaulted Anne
Marie.
Anne Marie, she said, adored her father and resented her.
It did not seem to matter that he had killed her mother and two
half-sisters. ''She thought the world of him,'' she said.
The trial continues.

IT came to Glasgay! From the depths of suburbia, with its manicured
lawns and dark privet -- sorry, private -- passions, it erupted with a
vengeance . . . The Hand!
Infact, in this self-styled coupling of lesbian horror and dance
macabre, it first comes from the depths of dirty raincoats to wave
suggestively, giving the rubber finger of suspicion a whole new scope
for pointing . . .
Everyone, it seems, in this superficially demure locale is driven by
untoward appetites. The little old lady who throbs with lust as she
watches the incestuous twins is in her turn observed by the fixated
mortician and her lover -- everyone is a voyeur, everyone laps up the
dangerous energy that steams off the sweaty, bloody mix of sex and
violence that can be spied by them -- and of course us -- through
neighbouring patio doors.
The whole piece seethes with sex. The language and the movement --
Emilyn Claid choreographed, Stella Duffy provided most of the text --
writhe and spurt with graphic images.
The dance element seems, at times, an after-thought to the hectic text
but it comes more and more into its own as the work hurtles to chaotic
climax -- and the formal tango of unlicensed lust is a highlight.

A POLICEMAN was found guilty yesterday of indecently assaulting a
35-year-old woman at her home.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, Sheriff Alexander Eccles warned Ian Gibson,
31, the consequences could be ''drastic''.
The sheriff ruled that on November 15 and 16 last year at Miss Karen
McNally's home, Gibson asked her questions of an indecent and personal
nature, offered her money, and placed her in a state of fear and alarm.
Gibson, of Fonstane Street, Monifieth, Dundee, was also found guilty
of assaulting Miss McNally, a mother of two.
Sheriff Eccles said he found Miss McNally's evidence credible and
added that it was corroborated by the ''distress'' she had shown to her
workmates.
The sheriff also pointed to Gibson's police notebook, ''which records
nothing of the visit, although faithfully records everything else''.
Gibson was cleared by Sheriff Eccles of a charge alleging that on
November 10 last year, he attempted to induce a Justice of the Peace to
grant him a search warrant and attempted to defeat the ends of justice.
A charge alleging that Gibson was concerned in the supply of cannabis
was dropped after the sheriff upheld a defence submission that there was
no case to answer.
Sentence was deferred for three weeks for reports.
Miss McNally, of Quarryfield Court, Dundee, said yesterday: ''He is a
police officer and he abused his position. I didn't want this to happen
to anyone else. All the trust I had in the police has now gone.''
During the trial, she told the court that the police officer had
turned up drunk at her flat late at night four days after a small amount
of cannabis was seized from her house in a police drugs raid. She said
Gibson asked her if they could ''come to some arrangement'' over the
drug and he implied that he would drop the charges against her in return
for sex.
The court heard that Gibson asked her if she indulged in oral sex and
made suggestions to her about handcuffs, touched her, offered her money,
grabbed her wrists, and struggled with her during his 90-minute visit.
Last night, chief inspector Brian Powrie, of the complaints and
discipline section of Tayside Police, said: ''The matter will not be
considered in terms of police discipline regulations until criminal
proceedings are concluded.''
However, he added: ''It is a contravention of the police discipline
regulations to be found guilty in a court of law. That could result in a
hearing before the chief constable, where there are a range of
penalties, one of which may be dismissal.''

IF you don't already know, Oxford's Radiohead are the new darlings of
the Rock'n'Roll Poets Society, which means they make abrasive heavy
guitar rock (see highly acclaimed album The Bends), complain about how
difficult modern life is for sensitive souls such as themselves, and are
often photographed wandering contemplatively in fields with books under
their arms.
Personally I don't think contemporary music is that hard up for
intelligent lifeform, but I'm still open-minded about the big question
-- can Radiohead rock?
Judging by last night's performance, they can, but only when they get
rid of the horribly pompous, overblown approach they often take (like
Suede with added histrionics, if you can imagine such a thing).
In general there's far too much po-faced posturing and not enough
compassion in Radiohead's set, but there are notable exceptions. The
fragile, trembling Sulk and the exquisite Fake Plastic Trees are both
sensitively executed (even I wouldn't blame Radiohead for the lighters
held aloft during the latter), and then there's what Radiohead are
probably sick of being called their ''anthem for a disaffected youth''.
Creep does its best to tug on adolescent heartstrings (are there any
other kinds?) and it succeeds to an extent, though it would be more
effective if it were not so self-consciously miserable, in the worst
bedroom-ridden schoolboy manner.

Law students should ignore the manoeuvres of the O J Simpson trial,
says Robert Dickson
BEFORE the O J Simpson trial I wrongly thought that there was little
doubt about his guilt. I did so because of all the pre-trial publicity,
the comments made by witnesses through the media and television coverage
of the events leading up to his arrest. There can have been few people
who had access to either newspapers or television who did not have a
great deal of knowledge about the case before the trial began.
It is perhaps a tribute to the ability of the jurors to put aside any
knowledge which they may have acquired from these sources when they came
to consider their verdict. It may be that lawyers and judges worry
needlessly about the effect which such articles and programmes can have.
Defence counsel could in future find it more difficult to argue that a
newspaper can, by exceeding the rules, prejudice a fair trial.
It is, however, in the actual conduct of the trial that some concern
has been expressed about the behaviour of those involved. The approach
adopted by the legal team employed by Mr Simpson was alien to that which
is acceptable in a British court.
Two were fined $950 each for deliberately misleading the court and
they were also criticised by the trial judge, Lance Ito, for withholding
witness statements from the prosecution. Guilty of ''a reckless
disregard for the truth if not a deliberate attempt to mislead'', the
defence lawyers showed no apparent contrition, instead agreeing to pay
the fine and suggesting that matters should ''move on''.
Because of the publicity given to the case and in particular because
it was the subject of live television, many law students and young
lawyers watched the trial avidly to see if they could benefit from
seeing experienced practitioners at work.
There is a genuine concern throughout the United States that the
example which they were given may result in trials taking considerably
longer and in tactics being adopted which are below the standard of
honesty and integrity expected from members of the legal profession.
Courts of America and those who practise before them have always taken
a different attitude as to what a defence counsel's duty is.
Mr Louis Nizer, an experienced American attorney, boasted in his
autobiography that he had cross-examined a witness about certain
documents implying that he had those documents in his possession and
deliberately holding a closed file in front of the witness as he
questioned him. The witness, believing that Mr Nizer had the documents
and was about to produce them, gave evidence which assisted Mr Nizer's
client.
The attorney, however, was aware that he did not have the documents
and did not even know they existed. Instead, he was exhibiting to the
witness a file which contained blank pieces of paper and his inference
that he had the documents was totally false.
Such behaviour is apparently totally acceptable in America; in a
British court, counsel who adopted such tactics might well find himself
the subject of a complaint for misconduct.
This is because it is accepted in this country that all who appear in
court, whether they be advocates or solicitors, have a paramount duty
not to deceive or mislead. In America the position appears to be that
the end justifies the means and that almost any tactics are acceptable
in putting forward a client's case.
To some it seems a small step from deliberately misleading a court to
ensuring that others do so. A Glasgow solicitor a number of years ago
was imprisoned for eight years after it was found that he, together with
two other people, had been responsible for pressuring witnesses who were
to give evidence for the prosecution in various trials.
He became excessively involved with his clients and their affairs and
as such was unable to separate his professional duty from the rest of
his life. His conviction at Glasgow High Court shocked many who had
believed that lawyers understood their responsibilities and duties.
It remains to be seen whether the behaviour of the defence team for O
J Simpson and the live televising of the case has any influence on the
conduct of trials in America or elsewhere.
If others with less experience and less knowledge endeavour to emulate
what was done in the course of the O J Simpson trial there is, at least
in some people's view, a grave danger that the courts may grind to a
halt and that whatever is said by court practitioners will be treated
with suspicion.
It has always been the proud boast of the British courts that those
who choose to make their profession within the courts exhibit an
integrity which entitles them to expect any judge to accept what they
say as being truthful and honest so far as they are aware. A great deal
of time is saved by this fact.
There now remains a genuine danger that young lawyers will try to copy
the tactics adopted in Los Angeles and lacking the ability and
experience of those who were involved there, will fall into the trap of
lowering their standards to try to secure success.
In the event of their behaviour coming to light they will do
irreparable damage to their own reputation and that of their profession.
It is, therefore, to be hoped that we are never subjected to the antics
of Los Angeles and that it will never be necessary for any British court
to find that somebody appearing before them has acted ''with a reckless
disregard for the truth''.
While the live televising of the O J Simpson trial may have provided
entertainment for many, time will tell whether it may not have wrecked
the standing of the legal profession throughout the United States. It
equally remains to be seen whether the effect may not filter through to
this country.

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats' autumn conference this weekend will
give the party a final chance to debate details of the home rule
proposals drawn up by the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
Some of the delegates meeting in Dunfermline may express some disquiet
about the deal struck with Labour on the plans for a Scottish parliament
-- with both the number of members and the plans for gender equality
matters of sensitivity -- but it would be a major surprise if any
significiant number attempted to vote down the proposals.
Also on the agenda will be the state of education and water services.
SLD leader Jim Wallace said yesterday: ''This conference will see the
party continue to gear up for a general election. The Tories have been
in power too long, and it is time we were rid of this discredited and
disreputable Government.''
Later this week, the party will announce a new team of spokesmen and
women in Scotland. This will comprise existing senior MP's augmented by
prospective candidates drawn from key marginal seats.
THE Government yesterday refused to intervene over fears that a
satellite television company, such as BSkyB, could buy up the rights to
broadcast the FA Cup Final and other major national sporting events.
Junior National Heritage minister Lord Inglewood said at Question Time:
''With the exception of listed sports events which cannot be shown on a
pay-per-view basis, sports rights holders should continue to be free to
dispose of their rights to broadcast in the way they choose.'' Labour's
Lord Ashley of Stoke had warned that, when existing contracts end in
1997, Sky could easily outbid BBC and ITV for the broadcasting rights.
A TORY MP yesterday accused Labour's Glenda Jackson (above) of
''corrupt'' use of parliamentary facilities. Mr David Shaw (Dover)
protested that Ms Jackson (Hampstead and Highgate) had booked a Commons
room for a party political meeting to discuss her #5500 sponsorship by
the rail union, Aslef. Speaker Betty Boothroyd told him: ''Very serious
allegations have been made by you and, with respect, I would ask you to
put them in writing to me so that I might respond properly, because I am
not quite clear what you are insinuating.''

With late payment still sending promising businesses to the wall, Bill
Stark argues that legislation is needed to prevent further damage to the
enterprise culture
IN A perfect trading world, I would not exist -- at least, not in my
present capacity. All debts would be settled within 30 days and all
cash-flow projections would be reliable. Nor would there be much call
for debt-recovery managers in a perfect financial world: credit would be
extended indefinitely and debts would be converted into short-term loans
at high interest. But, then, nothing is perfect; nor is it ever likely
to be. As St John preached about the poor, debt will always be with us.
However, the recession of recent years, blamed for so much terminal
corporate and personal indebtedness, has had one beneficial consequence.
Forcing reappraisal of management attitudes and practices, tough trading
times have led in general to far higher standards of credit control and
to greatly improved debt-recovery performance.
Yet, as long as there are devious, avaricious, incompetent or just
plain negligent folk in business, there will always be a cheque in the
post and debt-recovery managers trying to accelerate its retrieval.
There is no doubt that late payment, deliberately or carelessly
delayed beyond tolerable limits, is still sending many promising
businesses to the wall; no doubt that legislation will be needed to
prevent further penetrating damage to the enterprise culture.
In one respect, anyway, that legislation ought to be enacted to
protect firms from their own inadequacies. The impression given by the
small-business lobby is that only parliamentary legislation can enforce
observation of due payment dates and impose penal interest for failing
to meet them. This is not true. In fact, the most diffident creditor,
reluctant to press a claim for fear of antagonising the customer, has
always been able to obtain interest on an outstanding debt and pursue
the debtor.
All that is needed is a straightforward administrative discipline and
the resolve that goods or services are going to be paid for without
unreasonable delay. If the paperwork is right it will hold up in court.
Efficient debt recovery is achieved by firm credit control and, while
some may regard it as a mundane administrative chore, effectiveness
depends upon considerable breadth and depth of market knowledge and an
instinct for detecting human guile.
Specialists in this function -- working in-house or externally (as
para-legals in law firms, for example) -- should be capable of
establishing and maintaining this critical discipline. Its role in good
housekeeping should never be undervalued.
The guidelines for debt recovery are simple, but remember the law of
increasing returns: all business is dedicated to obtaining longer credit
from suppliers than it is extending to customers.
For protection against bad debts, a firm should obtain at the outset
of a contract as much information as possible about a customer and his
or her business, their operational details, their trading and financial
status. If, as we say in debt recovery, one has to ''go legal''
(initiate legal proceedings for recovery), possession of such
information enables action to be taken swiftly and with greater chance
of success.
It is important that staff appreciate the necessity of having proper
contract documentation and ensuring that it is accurately completed.
Clear terms and conditions of trading should stipulate the period in
which payment is to be made and the interest which will be levied on top
of the principal.
Sales personnel, especially, should bear this in mind and make sure
that any contract is underpinned by a customer's signature to a copy of
the terms and conditions and is sealed by the customer's completion of a
credit application.
Although, to some traders, this may imply a lack of personal trust, no
customer or client with good intent and a sound business foundation will
demur at such a request. Prudence of this kind denotes responsible
management practice and is more likely to earn respect than incur
antipathy.
The length of credit extended to customers should be based upon a
viable, but realistic, number of debtor days and should be firmly
maintained. Additional credit protection should be introduced when
dealing with new customers or those for which background information is
scanty -- cash with order, deposit requirement or personal guarantee
from a director or third party.
Furthermore, any measure to secure prompt payment is strengthened by
regular personal contact between a credit controller and the person of
equivalent responsibility for the customer's payments.
Faced with a persistently outstanding debt, the aim of recovery should
be a commercial settlement reached by gentle persuasion. Failing that,
and there being no dispute to impede payment, recovery can be pursued
through court action. A professional debt-recovery service will handle
this as a small claim, summary cause, or ordinary action, depending on
the size of the debt, with standard fees ranging from about #75 to
around #160 for obtaining an undefended decree.
Options for enforcing payment after obtaining an undefended decree
include poinding (judicial seizure of goods for a warrant sale),
arrestment of a debtor's earnings, ''ordinary'' arrestments in the hands
of not only the debtor's bank account but also your debtor's debtors,
sequestration or liquidation.
An ''ordinary'' arrestment is a particularly effective recovery tool
as it is an option which is available on the dependence of a court
action. It can work as a pre-emptive step to protect the interests of
the creditor at the start of a court action, and before decree is
obtained.
A dispute plays the ball into a different park: a defended action
really means ''going legal'', with the possibility of high cost and,
unless the pursuer's argument and documentation are watertight, no
certainty of a favourable result.
When a supplier's credit discipline is lax or faulty, debtors are
volunteered the opportunity for holding back payment and there are
plenty who will take the advantage. Better to give them no excuse
whatsoever. Get the paperwork right. Perhaps any Government legislation
aimed at defaulting debtors ought also to compel fallible management to
tighten up their credit control. Then I might well be unemployed.

WE can reveal the reason for the Monday celebrations in every almost
every sheriffdom: we're the new European legal golf champions. A
15-strong team from the Law Society of Scotland led by former president
Brian Adair, lifted the trophy in Cadiz at the weekend, beating
England's elite blue team (typical South British nefariousness: they
fielded three sides) in the final. Comprehensively gubbed them, in fact,
10[1/2] to 3[1/2], which restores some pride after Scottish sheriffs
lost to English circuit judges at Royal Porthcawl in June. It was as
unexpected a victory by the bookies, we are told, as was Aberdeen FC's
over a Spanish side in 1983 which prompted the famous headline on their
return: ''It's Nae Real''.
Vintage justice
RELIEF at least for forensic bibliophiles who have been waiting 82
years for a reprint of Twelve Scots Trials by Edinburgh solicitor and
author William Roughhead. Mercat Press has now obliged with a new
edition. They certainly don't make them like they used to: the infamous
Major Weir ''Scotland's most notable wizard'', the body-snatcher of
Dunecht (no, not Robbie Shepherd), the Parson of Spott who strung his
wife up and tried to make it look like suicide, and the ''unprecedented
and atrocious'' Arran murder in which Roughead cut his legal and
literary teeth. He was a prolific writer attracting the admiration of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Slater. His edition of that trial was
instrumental in securing Slater's ultimate pardon in 1928.
Reekie rumour
A WITNESS in the current Court of Session action by solicitor Raymond
Connor, former managing director of Kwik Fit Insurance, described the
hush-hush meetings set up by the venture last year. ''It was supposed to
be fairly secret, but it was probably the worst-kept secret in
Edinburgh'' he remarked. Obviously, you can't get quicker than a Kwik
Fit rumour. In Edinburgh, anyway.
Bastions of the Law (No 78)
THE diary bids a fond farewell to Scotland's baldiest-heided legal
eagle, Lord Allanbridge, whose wit and wisdom has often graced this
column. He hung up his robes yesterday, just before his 70th birthday,
after a career at the bar which stretches back 44 years, the longest of
any of his judicial colleagues.
As William Ian Stewart he took silk in 1965 and was Solicitor General
from 1972 to 1974 in the latter stages of the Heath administration. His
family connections with Bridge of Allan accounts for the title he
assumed on elevation to the bench in 1977.
In the rarefied atmosphere of Parliament House where intellectual
sophistry often stifles common sense, he had a reputation for espousing
the latter rather than demonstrating the former. He was good at asking
questions juries would want answered. As one of his junior counsel
remarked ''his capacity for ingenuous disbelief and apparent
misunderstanding masked an analytical brain, shrewdness and
single-mindedness.''
This column has chronicled various Allanbridgeisms over the years.
Follicularly challenged is not in it, he is a veritable Yul Brynner,
which he made use of in a Court of Session case involving a man who fell
into a harbour and was miraculously saved by two friends grabbing him by
the hair as he went under for the third time. Not a potential method of
rescue open to himself, the judge remarked.
Another time when discussing the floral delights of the Allanbridge
garden, he asked his macer what he had in his garden. ''A cooker and a
three-piece suite'' came the reply, ''those bastards upstairs have just
been evicted.''

HEALTH Care International, which got its arithmetic a teensy bit
wrong, costing the taxpayers a sum somewhere in the region of #40m,
seems to have a similarly shaky grasp on geography. In its two-page
colour advert in American magazine Newsweek (cost: $245,000 per page if
distributed worldwide) it talks of ''a multi-million pound investment''
and of its patients ''benefiting from our location as well as our
expertise''. It continues: ''The hospital is situated on the banks of
the River Clyde'', and the full-page picture, into which are tastefully
set shots of wealthy-looking people being cared for in a very hi-tech
fashion indeed, is of a rather picturesque part of the bonnie, bonnie
banks of Loch Lomond, not the not quite so bonnie banks of Clydebank.
Transfer steaks
FOOTBALLERS' favourite dishes and the opening of suitably named
restaurants would appear to be very much on readers' menus, with a
suggestion from Ian Gordon of Maryhill that the gay former striker
Justin Fashanu would be well sorted with Mince and Nae Totties, while a
correspondent who wishes (for political reasons) to be known as The Big
Red One suggests that Frank Worthington, author of an autobiography
whose sexual revelations and relations were both mega and multiple,
should open a restaurant called Pork Anything.
Andrew Leslie of Edinburgh thinks that Bill McMurdo, agent of good
fortune, should open The Quids Inn, while Peter Grant's genteel wee nook
should be known as The Parkhead Beastro.
Finally, for today at any rate, J C Thomson of Ayr suggests that
should the Ayr United board of directors decide to branch into catering,
their establishment would be well titled Pie In The Sky.
Current affairs
IN sporting spirit, might we wish Rangers well at Ibrox tonight, while
delivering ourselves of what we swear is positively the last O J joke
(at least for this week), which is: ''What is the difference between O J
and Rangers?'' The answer being that when O J spends #14m on a defence,
it works.
Positively not the last Rangers joke we will air asks the question:
''Why are Rangers like a 13-amp plug?'' Because they're both useless in
Europe.
Hoots mon
THE diary spent a very enjoyable chunk of Saturday night in the Old
Athenaeum at Hootsmon, the new regular venue for indigenous stand-ups
(plus the odd Irishman and Canadian). Irish-born but Glasgow-educated Ed
Byrne described how at discos during his days at Strathclyde Uni the
students would get up from their comfy seats when the James number Sit
Down was played and (daring shock horror) actually sit down amid the pee
and puke on the dance floor. Ed used to worry for the safety of his
girlfriend, Eileen, should this trend ever expand to include Come On
Eileen.
Moos news
WORD from the Stornoway Gazette, supplied by local Iain MacDonald, of
an unusual item in the personal columns headed ''Noisy cow''. It reads
in its entirety: ''Would the owner of the cow residing at 18 Geurshader
please ensure steps are taken to silence her -- or find 'Daisy' a
partner.'' In our ignorance of the townscape of Stornoway we do not know
if 18 Geurshader is a byre, a council flat, or a semi-detached, or, for
that matter, the species of the suggested partner.
Lip-smacking good
AMONG the more delectable and desirable pieces up for auction in the
Red Ribbon Art Show, in aid of Aids awareness and education, is a red
ribbon shape formed by the multiple applications (18, and yes, we did
count them personally) of Joanna Lumley's lips to a lucky bit of paper,
signed ''Love from Joanna Lumley''.
The auction runs from 6pm to 8pm this Friday at the Original Print
Shop in King's Street, and all of the works can be inspected during the
day this week. The starting bid for Joanna's masterwork is #25 and a
forward-looking entrepreneur could make a fortune by breaking up the
work and selling the kisses individually to slavering Lumley groupies
like the Diary.
Among the other cherishable pieces is a pair of knickers made from red
ribbons by artist Jonathan Cassels. The starting price for these is #10
and Fiona Eadie, the charming blonde person from The Print Studio, says
that they will be modelled on the night, perhaps even by herself. This
is auction-going as it should be and there are another 40 pieces by
local luminaries including Alasdair Gray, Adrian Wiszniewski, and Johnny
Taylor on offer.
West fest best
MICHAEL DALE, former Fringe supremo and now arts festival freelance,
is currently planning the West End Festival, which was discussed at a
meeting in the Cottier Theatre last week. Michael, who during a
wide-ranging discussion of the geography of the West End and the spread
and remit of the festival, committed the West End solecism of confessing
that he has only one house, welcomes suggestions for a newer and
snappier name for the festival.
The diary's tentative tryout of TWEIAWOL, as in The West End Is A Way
Of Life, was scorned, but a bottle of something wet, vinous, and West
Endy from the well-renowned cellars of the Ubiquitous Chip will be
awarded to the supplier of the most suitable suggestion.

THE prospect of salmon sticks, salmon nuggets, breaded salmon and
smoked salmon pies flooding the market loomed yesterday as Scottish
Office Minister Raymond Robertson encouraged the Scottish salmon
industry to diversify into ''value-added'' products to help ensure its
survival.
The Scottish Select Committee recommended in a report that salmon
producers should consider ''innovative product development,'' and
yesterday the Government made clear that it supports the idea.
In its response, the Government said: ''Certain individual companies
which are leading the way in the field of new and innovative product
development deserve commendation for their efforts. The Government
agrees that such developments are very important for the future.''
European money may be forthcoming for such product development, but
the Government has made it clear that it will not be giving direct
funding. The Government response states: ''We recognise the importance
of new product development (but) in general it is considered that the
funding of such work is best left to individual companies.
''Accordingly, the Government does not intend to shift the existing
research resources into this area of near-market research. The
Government will, however, continue to fund appropriate generic research
on food safety, nutrition, quality and food processing, some of which
may be applicable to the development of added-value fish products.''
Mr Robertson, who is to visit Norway later this month to investigate
ways in which some stability can be brought to the market, said last
night: ''I am pleased to support the conclusions of the report and
encourage the salmon industry to do likewise.''
Elsewhere in its response, the Government strongly defends the action
it is taking to defend the interests of the Scottish salmon industry.
It states: ''The Scottish Office already takes the lead on matters of
concern to the Scottish salmon farming industry. The committee and the
salmon industry can be assured, therefore, that market prices will
continue to be monitored carefully alongside other factors which may
impact adversely on the market in the short and longer term.''

<TEXT>
THE Government last night persuaded MPs to throw out a bid by the
House of Lords to widen the net of people covered by curbs on
discrimination against the disabled.
As the Disability Discrimination Bill neared the end of its
parliamentary stages, Ministers acted to overturn a key Lords defeat.
Peers voted by 94 to 50, in June, to widen the definition of
''disability'' to cover people who were not significantly handicapped
and those who were ''perceived'' to be disabled.
However, Ministers said the amendment could blur the tight definition
laid down of disability and MPs voted by 285 to 250, a Government
majority of 35, to reject the Lords amendment.
With the end of the parliamentary session next week, peers are not
expected to challenge the Commons decision when the Bill return there on
Monday.

AS sentimental Tories are fond of saying, the British constitution is
a wonderful, even a magical thing. What other system allows the accused
a free vote on the charges against them? You can't -- not with a
straight face -- say fairer than that.
Of course, when the Commons delivers its verdict next Monday on a
report on the Nolan recommendations being drawn up by its Select
Committee on Public Standards, guilt will not be an issue. His
lordship's committee has set out only to improve things, not to finger
culprits. All the same, the principle remains startling.
MPs with wads of directorships and consultancies, earning vastly more
than the taxpayer grants solely by virtue of their membership of the
House, will be invited to say whether they fancy identifying where the
cash comes from. Men and women whose loyalties are, at best, divided
(shredded would be a better word) will be called upon to come clean or
continue, both shameless and furtive, as before.
It should beggar belief that as many as 100 Tory MPs are said to be
deeply unhappy about all this, but so morally penurious has the system
become no-one bats a weary eyelid. Several Conservatives have said, in
so many words, that public service is a mug's game unless they can be
guaranteed what the football world calls a bung. That, it is implied, is
why they entered politics in the first place.
This alone sheds an interesting light on their grasp, or lack thereof,
of ethics. They no longer care who knows that most of them are the
mouthpieces of private interests, or that the public despises them for
it, or that most people would outlaw their freelance activities tomorrow
given half a chance. All they fear is that they may have to disclose
just how much they are making. That's all.
They suspect, quite rightly, that the public would be shocked by the
figures. Some voters might begin to wonder how the average back-bench MP
serves the electorate on any given day, what with all that lobbying,
consulting, boardroom bickering, and power lunching. People might
conclude that for many of the suits the business of the House is an
afterthought. And that, sooner or later, would be bad for business.
Two defences are advanced for this sort of corruption. One is that
MPs' salaries are too low, rendering the job unattractive, if he is
forbidden to work on the side, to your average, thrusting captain of
industry with a burning ambition to make Britain great again.
The second, only slightly more comic argument is that outside
interests give MPs a better understanding of the real world. In other
words, a few hours a month slaving in the boardroom, or tirelessly
organising Commons cocktail parties on behalf of Global Coolie Labour
plc, allows our parliamentarians properly to understand the concerns of
the ordinary citizen and has nothing whatever to do with peddling
influence.
The point is, of course, that no-one is suggesting depriving the
people's tribunes of their candy. If they were, the answer would be
simple: raise salaries (triple them if need be) but forbid MPs to
undertake any other paid work. Those who still felt the need to increase
their knowledge of the real world might then be asked why they thought
they were fit for election in the first place.
But this is not the issue. As things stand, numbers of MPs,
beneficiaries of 16 years of Conservative government, are saying they
literally cannot afford to be honest. The sort of politicians who
advocate, say, identity cards on the grounds that the innocent have
nothing to hide, are making a song, dance, and West End musical out of
the fact that they themselves are being invited to be just a little more
truthful.
That they are also judge and jury in their own case is one of the
marvels of the constitution. The sovereignty of Parliament it is called,
meaning in this case that no-one can tell MPs what to do. There is no
oversight, no check or balance. They are kings of the midden and only
public opinion can topple them -- always presuming they still care about
such a quaint idea.
Sleaze, in this, is too small a word for what goes on. The money being
made, enough to shame the flabby tabbies of the public utilities if half
the tales are true, only symbolises the way the constitution grants
sovereign power to people who -- and this may be the best wheeze of all
-- themselves guarantee the constitution.
The purpose of the club, first and foremost, is the club's
preservation; the one rule is to have no rules. So who ever said the
Tories were the stupid party?

A GREAT many glib comparisons have been drawn with Scotland in the
run-up to Quebec's referendum. Now we know its result, we can draw some
sager ones. The first is that both belong to liberal, democratic,
capitalist polities, Britain and Canada respectively. Most of their
citizens are content with them. Those polities give them, after all,
what they want: the freedom to shape their own lives, the right to play
a part in the common life, the chance to make themselves and others
richer.
It is not the ideal solution to all human problems, but it will do
nicely while we wait for that to be discovered, which looks like taking
a while yet. It is certainly better than anything else on offer.
Socialists used to tell us that they had the solution, the burial of
capitalism. But they are the ones who have been buried. In Scotland,
many of the very same people, scarcely pausing to draw breath, now tell
us that nationalism is the solution, again as if the destruction of the
old will inevitably cause something new and better to arise.
The mass of their contented fellow citizens seldom bother to join in
this prattle. But when a verdict is exacted of them, it is usually
devastating to the prattlers. Then we see what an immense, if often
latent, strength the polities such as Britain and Canada possess. And it
may well be that their liberal, democratic, capitalist character is what
truly secures it.
Britain and Canada are two of a family of such polities in the world
which, despite their success in satisfying the aspirations of ordinary
people, regularly attract the scorn of idealists. Britain is a bit
tired, Canada a bit boring, and neither can pretend to offer ideal
solutions to anyone. They ask their citizens only to believe in means
rather than ends, in process rather than product.
Of course, grievances then easily arise. Grievances are a cottage
industry in Scotland, and for all I know in Quebec too. In one sense,
the British and Canadian systems of government thrive on them, or rather
on constant adjustment to them, since that is what means rather than
ends, process rather than product, are all about.
Yet grievances can threaten to get out of hand. Not only Britain and
Canada but all such polities have faced terrible strains, often of an
ethnic or racial nature. Still, in the 1990s as in the 1950s, they have
come through. Nationalism has now riven the once idealist polities of
the former Communist bloc. It has yet to break one single polity of the
West. Surely for that we have their liberal, democratic, capitalist
character to thank.
In another sense, though, means rather than ends, process rather than
product, are eternally jejune and unsatisfying. They do not touch the
deepest chords in Britons, Canadians or any similar nationality, if only
because they are not meant to. The depths belong to a sphere of freedom
which such polities, unlike idealist ones, decline to intrude on. But
this does not mean the depths are emptied. Here I think Scotland and
Quebec may be exemplary, rather than the mere bearers of grievances that
they often suffer themselves to appear before the world.
Their two peoples found an affinity almost from the moment they came
under a common Crown. The first Governor of Quebec after the conquest
was James Murray of Elibank who, called upon to anglicise the province,
refused, saying the French Canadians ''are perhaps the bravest and the
best race upon the globe''.
Almost two centuries later, that esteem was echoed by John Buchan,
Governor-General of Canada from 1935-40. A character in his last, great,
Canadian novel, Sick Heart River, praises this ''fine European stock
planted out in a new country and toughened by two centuries of hardship
and war. They keep their close family life and their religion intact and
don't give a cent for what we call progress. Yet all the time they have
a pretty serious fight with nature, so there is nothing soft in them.''
Buchan was an imperialist, but also a patriotic Scotsman with, I
think, a profound understanding of nationality, especially of
nationality that survived against the odds, and of what formed and
transformed it in the course of progress. He believed that Canada, a
random assemblage of peoples, had for the sake of her future to look
beyond her inevitable early communalism towards the construction of a
new nationality.
To him, the likeness with Scotland might point the way: Highland and
Lowland races had fused, then fused again with the other British
peoples, so that Scots had multiple loyalties. For Canada too, it should
be a matter of pride that she housed such diverse cultures. If she could
gain more confidence, more sense of herself and of her history, that was
something to unite the provinces rather than drive them apart.
In the case of Scotland, we know that the fusions came only slowly and
often painfully. But the adversity tempered them, and in the nation's
depths made it finally a richer place, with more to contribute to
Britain and indeed the rest of the world than ever, say, a Sweden or a
Switzerland could do.
Like them, Canada long had a duller, and for that reason perhaps a
happier, history. But now she has had to endure her trials and she has,
certainly for the time being and I hope for good, survived them. If so,
she will be a richer place too, as already seems clear from the
heartfelt pleas of other Canadians that Quebec should not leave them.
They were heeded, which ought to show us that a country of simple
freedoms rather than great ideals is not less worthy of loyalty and
love.

IN AN all-seater stadium like the Commons, you can never be quite sure
where the worst barracking is going to come from.
Often it originates from the terrace, where Mr Dennis Skinner and his
cloth cap-and-muffler pals sit, obviously yearning for the old days when
you could stand and shout and wave your rattles. Sometimes, it comes
from the more elegantly attired but basically equally yobbish lot
scattered about the Tory back benches.
But you never can tell. Yesterday the referee, Miss Betty Boothroyd,
rounded on the ministerial terrace. This was like discovering coarse
behaviour in the directors' box, despite the salmon sandwiches and the
champers.
She pointed an accusing finger (the yellow card) at the massive figure
of Defence Minister Nicholas Soames who, in her view, had gone a barrack
too far. It was another example of a boy from a good family (Churchill's
grandson), with an expensive education (Eton), and offered every
opportunity to move in the best society (equerry to Prince Charles),
unable to control himself when he goes to a football match or Question
Time.
In one of their famous midfield arguments, T Blair again accused J
Major of dirty play, which had taken the form of ''a lurch to the
right''.
He was the Blues captain, reproached Blair, but he was giving way to
those players in his team obsessed with right-wing tactics which were
against the spirit of the game and despised by spectators wanting a
decent match.
Pretty annoyed by this. J Major called T Blair ''a Trojan Horse of
socialism'', not an epithet you hear used a lot on the field. Make his
lot team of the year in 1997, and off will come the pink jerseys and on
will be pulled the red ones and the next thing you know the pools will
be nationalised along with the lottery.
The Blues would continue to play the centre-right of the pitch and
dominate it as they had always done. Who was Blair anyway to go on about
lurching to the right, snapped Major, when every fan knew he had
scrapped his team's traditional left-wing dribble just because it had
lost them the last four finals.
Tempers really flared, though, when P Ashdown tried to scythe J Major
down with the flying Bosnian Tackle which he has made a speciality.
Major thinks this is one of the dirtiest tactics in the game and he came
up spitting.
It looked for a minute as if the ref might have to separate them or
even that Major might be tempted to try the little-used but dreaded Lord
George Riposte. Though urged on by his team-mates, he controlled
himself, obviously with difficulty, and stuck to a few hard words none
of which amounted to a red card offence.
The rough stuff didn't stop there. Another signing scandal has rocked
the Westminster League. It was revealed that Ashdown had written to
members of Major's team urging them to play on his side. What
inducements he held out have not been revealed. Perhaps they could be
Liberal Democrat candidates at the next election. Anyhow it didn't work.
Still shaken by the notorious Howarth incident in which the man gave
himself a free transfer to the Pinks, the rest of the team stayed loyal.
Instead, one of Ashdown's players in the junior local government
league told the media that she was so taken with Major's style that she
was donning the blue jersey. Would Major be too sporting to mention it?
Would he? You could hear the boot going in from the very back of the
ground.

THE SNP candidate for Govan will be a woman, following the selection
of a shortlist which happens to be all-female, rather than one
calculated to bring about such a result.
The seat was once the scene of a famous SNP victory, and in redrawn
form is being fought out by rival Labour candidates Mike Watson,
Mohammed Sarwar and James Dunnachie for that party's selection. It will
be contested by one of three prominent SNP women.
The shortlist comprises:
* Nicola Sturgeon, vice-convener for youth affairs and party energy
spokeswoman.
* Patsy Thomson, convener of Glasgow SNP City Association.
* Shona Robison, elected member of the party's national council.
The SNP pointed out that the shortlist came about in this way simply
because the party had a good record on advancing women as candidates and
into key positions.

THERE are few things more deflating than the anti-climax which
descends after a wedding. All that fevered anticipation, the thrill of
the preparations, the joyous romanticism: all simply scattered to the
wind like so many rose petals.
The confetti settles and it slowly sinks in that the party is over.
Thus, the excitement of last weekend has long dissipated and a dull,
uneventful winter beckons. My mates are in a state of gloom and
despondency. Half the nation is in a state of gloom and despondency. Now
that Lizzie and Darcy are finally spliced there's simply nothing to look
forward to, not even the perverse pleasure of awaiting the announcement
of their divorce. Such a pity that Jane Austen wasn't big on sequels.
How ever will we fill our Sunday evenings? What can possibly
compensate for the nail-biting tension of following the languid
courtship of Lizzie Bennet and Mr Darcy? Rarely has a television series
captured the imagination of the public so completely.
An astonishing ten million people attended, via the televisual medium,
the double wedding of Jane and Lizzie to Bingley and Darcy, the last
episode in the BBC's dramatisation of Pride and Prejudice. And while we
were celebrating the nuptials, the marketing men were popping the Moet.
The release of the video was a #1m sell-out, with 50,000 copies snapped
up in only eight days. That video is our destiny. That is how we will
fill our Sunday evenings through the coming dark months -- clustered
around the VHS endlessly replaying the romance.
Sunday evenings saw my friends phoning each other from eight o'clock
onwards, doing a countdown to Darcy time. The nearer to nine it got, the
more unintelligible our conversation became. By five to nine we were
reduced to simply shrieking and giggling down the phone like
hormone-charged excitable teenagers. ''Aargh, aargh, only three minutes
to go.''
Throughout the series as much acreage of newsprint has been devoted to
analysing its popularity as the acreage of cleavage on display on the
screen, but behaviour like that -- answer phones carefully switched on
to fend off possible interruptions, after all, anyone as out of touch
not to be watching would not be worth conversing with -- defies rational
analysis.
But what the heck! Here goes with some irrational analysis. I reckon
our enthusiasm for the stirrings between Lizzie and Darcy is not to do
with a longing for gentle romance. In these action-packed days who has
time for that? A phone vigil is bad enough. Sitting around straining
one's ears for the clatter of horses' hooves and an epistle from a
messenger must have been enough to make you want to tear your carefully
coiffed hair out by the roots. No wonder they ended their days wearing
wigs.
Neither are we really so enamoured of gentlemanly ways. All that
restraint would be terribly frustrating -- Darcy's final noble
declaration that ''My affections and wishes are unchanged but one word
from you would silence me forever'' was really as racy as he ever got.
Anyway, we can't possibly demand that guys start acting like
gentlemen. Girls, that is one rocky road. Ask them to open doors and
such like and there will be a terrible price to pay -- next thing we
know they'd be expecting us to act like ladies and then we'd truly be
stuffed. I suspect it would involve far too much simpering and silence
for the mouthy modern miss.
Nope, our admiration for Lizzie and our weak-kneed desire for Darcy
was predicated on one fact alone. The man was minted. We are talking
serious dosh. Big house, lakes, carriages, and a brace of servants more
than happy to take care of tasks like cleaning the toilet bowl are a
seriously attractive feature in the man.
He might have cut a dashing figure in those tight riding breeches but
we were more interested in the bulge in his wallet. And we couldn't help
suspecting that Lizzie was well impressed too -- the way her eyes glazed
over and her heart visibly palpitated under the thin muslin when she
caught sight of his manor in episode four quite gave the game away. One
glimpse of his estate and she knew she had seriously misunderstood him.
She even admitted as much to sister Jane, who hearing of Lizzie's
engagement was extremely puzzled by her change of heart and demanded an
explanation.
''I date it from seeing his beautiful grounds at Penbrook,'' said
Lizzie in the kind of ironic tone which she clearly hoped would imply
the reverse. But we saw her smirk. That's the same kind of irony that me
and my mates use when we quiz someone on a new amour. ''Is he loaded?''
We all participate in the pretence that it's a big joke but we are
really deadly earnest.
Throughout the past decade we lauded first the career woman who forged
her economic independence and then the new-age activist, who spurned the
rat race in pursuit of wealth for simple pleasures and ideological
satisfaction.
NOW it's the time of the gold digger. Some girls are at the tackier
end, but some of the most influential female figures of the century have
either been sophisticated gold diggers or proponents of the trend --
from Jackie O, Marilyn ''diamonds are a girl's best friend'' Monroe, to
Madonna and her ''Material Girl'' ethos.
Chasing a man for his money is back in fashion -- hip magazine Marie
Claire has just sanctioned it with its coverline competition, Win a Date
With A Millionaire.
We've been avidly watching Pride and Prejudice to take tips from
Lizzie. The trouble is, there aren't too many Mr Darcys out there.
Things are clearly going to get tough. The return of the gold digger
could be the end of sisterhood as we know it. But brother, who cares? On
with the chase!

A GAMEKEEPER who set poisoned bait on moorland was fined #2500 at
Perth Sheriff Court yesterday.
Sheriff John Wheatley said James Lambie, 24, had acted with complete
recklessness in an area which was home to golden eagles and other birds
of prey.
Lambie, employed on Farleyer Estate near Aberfeldy, admitted placing
six eggs doctored with alpha-chloralose on ground where they would harm
any wild bird coming in contact with them.
He also admitted keeping a banned pesticide -- Mevinphos -- in a sauce
bottle in his unlocked Land Rover.
Depute fiscal Ken McKay said the eggs were found on an exposed part of
the estate.
He added: ''It's a matter of speculation as to what species may have
consumed them and been killed as a result.''
Referring to the banned pesticide, Mr McKay said: ''It's a
particularly deadly poison, almost like cyanide. A few drops ingested
can cause instant death and it's equally toxic when absorbed through the
skin.''
Lambie was not in court but in a letter his lawyer stressed he was a
conscientious and responsible gamekeeper. The letter explained: ''The
eggs were set out for the purpose of controlling hooded crows which were
liable to take grouse eggs to the prejudice of the shooting on the
estate.
''The Mevinphos was obtained by our client seven years ago when it was
an approved pesticide. When its container leaked it was transferred to
the sauce bottle because this was more secure. He never in fact used it
and was unaware its approval had been revoked.''

SCOTTISH MPs last night in the Commons called for more consistency in
sentences handed down by the courts and for the Lord Advocate to issue
guidelines to ensure the punishment fitted the crime.
Mr John McFall, for Labour, suggested the setting up of a sentencing
commission.
The calls came as a series of Bills, consolidating and making
technical changes to sentencing and criminal procedure in Scotland,
cleared the Commons.
Mr McFall told the House: ''We have had inconsistencies in sentencing
during the summer.
''One young man was sentenced to two years in jail for stealing #5
from football pool collections, and the next day a young man was given a
community service order for badly beating a 78-year-old pensioner. Such
inconsistency cannot be allowed.''
Tory Phil Gallie (Ayr) said there was great concern about sentencing
inconsistencies in Scotland, but added: ''There is also great concern
about those who judge the judges.''
Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port Glasgow -- Lab.) said one High
Court judge had been ''remarkably lenient'' in his sentencing in some
recent cases that had involved ''horrendous'' crimes.
He urged the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, to issue
guidelines to Sheriffs and High Court judges on appropriate sentencing
policy.
Scottish Office Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton replied
that the Government had made it clear it wanted ''more honesty'' in
sentencing.
''We do wish to see sentencing approximating more closely to what the
court decides. But the judiciary is independent of the Government.''
CRIMINALS face the prospect from today of losing everything they own
as tough new legislation designed to claw back the proceeds of crime
comes into effect.
The legislation gives English courts discretion, in certain
circumstances, to assume that all an offender's money and goods have
been financed by his criminal activities.
The power, contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995 is designed to
target so-called ''lifestyle'' criminals, persistent offenders who use
crime to finance extravagant ways of life.
Fraudsters, pornographers and professional burglars are high on the
list of the criminals whom prosecutors hope to trap with the new
legislation.
Previously courts could only apply the ''lifestyle'' assumption to
drug dealers.
Home Office Minister David Maclean said: ''These new powers will mean
that crime doesn't pay. This Act quite literally means that criminals
face losing their homes, their cars and their possessions if the courts
think they have been bought with the proceeds of crime.''

LABOUR MP Derek Enright has died after a long battle with cancer, the
Labour Party said last night. Mr Enright, 60, represented Hemsworth,
West Yorkshire.
Labour leader Tony Blair paid tribute to Mr Enright and said he would
be ''sadly missed''.
Mr Blair said: ''Derek Enright was a popular and hard-working member
of Parliament who always spoke up strongly on behalf of his
constituents.
''His particular interests, in both education and the importance of
Britain's influence in Europe, were recognised throughout the House of
Commons.
''The party sends its condolences to his family. He will be sadly
missed.''
Hemsworth is one of the safest Labour seats. At the 1992 General
Election, Mr Enright had a majority of 22,075 over the Conservatives. He
entered Parliament at a by-election in November 1991.
With the current small Conservative majority in the Commons, Labour
will seek to hold the by-election as soon as possible, probably early
next year.
Mr Enright was a tough and persistent Commons performer, particularly
on education matters. He had an eye for detail and was a member of the
European Legislation Select Committee, which monitors complex European
legislation on both sides of the Channel.
He was educated at St Joseph's JMI, St Michael's College, Leeds, and
Wadham College, Oxford, before becoming a teacher and then a consultant
on European affairs.
After entering politics in 1974 as a member of West Yorkshire County
Council, he went on to become the Euro-MP for Leeds between 1979 and
1984.
Away from politics he was a fan of cricket and rugby league.
He is survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.

THE Tory-dominated Commons committee debating the Nolan
recommendations on parliamentary ''sleaze'' last night rejected
proposals to force MPs to declare their earnings from outside
activities, setting the stage for a dramatic confrontation in the
Commons next week.
Following a day of intense negotiations, and allegations of Government
tampering from Labour, the Select Committee on Standards in Public Life
rejected a Government proposal that changes to the rules governing MPs
be delayed until after the next election.
However, the committee concluded its final session divided along party
lines on the crucial question of disclosure, with Tory MPs refusing to
accept Lord Nolan's recommendations that MPs be forced to reveal all
their earnings from consultancies, directorships, and other
supplementary sources.
Labour immediately tabled an amendment calling for full disclosure,
and prepared for a confrontation in the Commons on Monday, when MPs will
debate and vote on the committee's report. Labour has suspended leave to
ensure all its MPs will be present. Deputy leader John Prescott will
have to cut short a visit to Australia.
The report could prove embarrassing for the Government. A number of
Tory MPs feel the reputation of the Commons, and the public standing of
the Tory Party, requires the Government to back disclosure. They could
support Labour on Monday.
Meanwhile, the first Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, to
watch over the Commons under the Nolan committee recommendations, was
named last night as Sir Gordon Downey, former Comptroller and Auditor
General.
Labour yesterday accused Leader of the House Tony Newton, who chairs
the select committee, of caving in to pressure in Cabinet and from back
benchers to dilute the committee's findings, which had been expected to
include support for full disclosure of earnings in the register of
members' interests.
Committee sources claim that despite Downing Street's denial that the
matter was not discussed at last week's Cabinet meeting, some Cabinet
have tried to alter recommendations agreed by the all-party committee.
The committee did accept proposals to abolish advocacy, whereby MPs
act and speak on behalf of special interests or lobby groups through the
use of Parliamentary questions and Early Day Motions.
Labour members succeeded in persuading the committee to accept the
party's proposal for an implementation timetable. Labour had insisted on
a maximum three months, while Mr Newton had demanded that implementation
be deferred until after the next election.
Some Tory MPs argue that they should be allowed to represent their
outside interests for the duration of a Parliament. However, a Labour
spokesman said: ''We are not having any of that. After all if you were
apointed Minister tomorrow you would give it up immediately. Anyway, we
are not asking them to give it up, we are just asking them to disclose
it.''
Labour has also complained that the Government has diluted its own
response to the Nolan recommendations on the rules governing jobs for
former Ministers.
Sir Gordon Downey was nominated by the cross-party Commons Commission
for the post of standards commissioner, whose creation earlier came
under fire from some Tories.
His appointment is recommended initially for three years on an annual
salary of #72,000 for a four-day week.
His duties include maintaining and monitoring the register of MPs'
interests, and providing confidential advice to Members and to the
proposed Select Committee on Standards and Privileges about the new code
of conduct.

I READ with interest the report by Elizabeth Buie about the call for
culling of protected bird species by landowners (October 26).
Yet again the Scottish Landowners Federation has failed to propose any
new measures to increase game birds, particularly in our moorland areas.
Instead it again favours the easy option of predator control. It would
seem that the SLF is promoting the Victorian principles of moorland
management.
I would like to comment on three points made by Mr Graeme Gordon.
While the increase in numbers of peregrines and ospreys is seen as a
conservation success, these two species are only recovering to
population levels that were present before the ruthless persecution of
them by game-bird interests began in the nineteenth century.
Secondly, while no-one would dispute that some raptors take game birds
and other moorland waders, their decline is due to much more complex
issues like habitat degradation. It's about time the SLF promoted better
habitat management by its members. It should be advocating a reduction
in grazing pressure by both sheep and deer along with improved
moor-burning practice.
As a member of the local raptor study group and a keen hillwalker,
when out on the moors I am hardly surprised that grouse numbers are so
low if the heather has been grazed short with bracken and grass
encroaching after overburning.
Lastly, the idea that ''the keeper is the true conservator'' and
should be furnished with licences legally to control raptors fills me
with horror. Already a walk through moorland or upland areas can be very
quiet indeed when all the birds and mammals considered undesirable have
been eliminated legally or not. This is not my idea of conservation and
is most certainly not land management either.
What I and many others want to see is healthier moors with more grouse
and, yes, more birds of prey!

WITH reference to the plea (October 26) by the Scottish Landowners
Federation for licences to kill or control protected species of birds of
prey, I can forecast an uphill struggle to convince RSPB directors and
Magnus Magnusson that any control of raptors is necessary. They are so
busy clapping each other on the back that they have little regard for
anything else.
I grew up at a time when the fields and woods were full of life,
keepered and cared for, ensuring that the balance was kept between prey
and raptor. Keepers did a good job, even allowing for the odd excesses.
Wildlife and songbirds were plentiful and God was in His Heaven.
Now foxes are a plague, hoovering up all ground-nesting birds, mainly
thanks to the Forestry Commission which gives them cover but no longer
controls them. Peregrines and all hawk species are no longer rare.
Buzzards, crows, and sparrowhawks are all to be seen daily following
their nefarious pursuits.
From the beginning of time we had 40 to 50 pairs of peewits regularly
nesting on a bog. The bog is still there but no birds thanks to foxes
and others.
Skylarks are still plentiful here but no longer climb into the sky as
I remember in glorious song but rise to about 30 feet to render a few
plaintive notes and hurriedly drop to cover. I wonder why.
Seagulls, guillemots and razorbills no longer live and nest on the
cliffs, rock pigeons and jackdaws are no more, but peregrines are there.
Brown hares, once plentiful, are extremely scarce, the leverets easy
prey to foxes and other predators. The grey partridge, my favourite, no
longer to be seen or heard calling in the summer evening, is but a
memory.
We had the rare event of a hen pheasant hatching off eight good
chicks. A week later all were gone -- the carrion crows saw to that.
This is a brief picture of the paradise drawn by the RSPB and other
worthies. The genuine country lover knows better and would dearly like
to turn the clock back to the golden years of keepers, with all their
faults.
The RSPB seems a worthy cause but I strongly suggest that anyone
thinking of leaving them money should study their ultimate aims.
Songbirds do not feature.
A decision will have to be made. Songbirds or raptors? You cannot have
both!

AS a member of Dumfries and Galloway Raptor Study Group for the past
10 years my task during the season is to monitor the breeding success of
all the raptors in my area (Nithsdale, Wanlockhead, and Leadhills). This
is carried out under licence issued by the Scottish Natural Heritage.
The call for raptor culling appears to come from a small minority with
a vested interest in shooting (October 26). It is my opinion that the
silent majority of Scots would be appalled to think that rare birds such
as peregrine and hen harriers were to be killed under licence.
In our area we see numerous incidents of illegal persecution,
particularly in relation to the hen harrier and peregrine. A licensed
system of killing raptors would only be additional to the current
illegal losses. Rather than licensed killing, law enforcers should be
devoting more time to upholding current laws.
Illegal incidents in the area I cover are:
Peregrines: New Cumnock, two shot at nest; Nithsdale, seven robbed of
eggs and two robbed of young. Only four pairs were reared young.
Hen harriers: Wanlockhead/Leadhills, at least 10 pairs robbed or shot.
Other members found similar losses in different areas of Dumfries and
Galloway. These incidents can be substantiated by the RSPB species
protection department.
On the plus side, raptor success on Buccleuch Estate (the biggest
private landowner in western Europe) has improved dramatically since the
Earl of Dalkeith had his gamekeepers sign a statement which threatened
them with dismissal if they were involved in bird-of-prey persecutions.
Raptors kill to survive, not for sport or fun as do the mega-rich
foreigners on Scottish estates.

A LABOUR MP has accused the Scottish Office of squandering public
money by awarding contracts worth almost #450,000 to a company for
helping to establish the three new water quangos.
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, was responding to
confirmation by Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch that
the Glasgow-based Baptie Group had been awarded the contracts.
Answering parliamentary questions, Mr Kynoch said the Baptie Group was
paid #108,815 for preparing ''a model framework and guidance notes to
assist regional and islands authorities and the central Scotland Water
Development Board in drawing up their asset transfer schemes''
stipulated under the Local Government (Scotland) Act of 1994.
The Minister also confirmed that Baptie had been awarded a contract
worth #337,750 to ''examine and comment upon the (water) asset transfer
schemes submitted to the Secretary of State for approval''.
Mr Donohoe said: ''It is scandalous that these amounts of money will
be paid out to a company to undertake work which should rightly be dealt
with by officials at the Scottish Office. For any company to get over
#300,000 of public money to 'examine and comment' on statutory documents
is indefensible.''
He added: ''I am told that the largest water authority in Scotland --
Strathclyde Regional Council's water services department -- ignored the
advice prepared by Baptie's in drafting its water asset transfer scheme
which it has handed to the Scottish Office.
''These revelations reinforce the fact that local government reform,
far from saving money, is costing the taxpayer millions of pounds that
could be better spent in other ways. The Scottish Office is pouring
public money down the drain.''
Mr Kynoch said last night: ''Mr Donohoe should not allow his
desperation to grab headlines to cloud his perception of the important
structures involved in delivering efficient water services to the
consumer.
''The consultants' work is designed to save public resources by
promoting a common approach. Transferring assets to the new water
authorities is a large and important task. The Secretary of State is
required by law to approve the scheme.
''Overseeing this process requires specialist knowledge and staff
resources beyond those available to the Scottish Office. After a
competitive tendering exercise, the Baptie group were appointed to do
the job.
''Most authorities followed the guidance prepared by Baptie's, however
it is to be regretted that Strathclyde chose to ignore it and adopt a
different approach.''

I WISH to express my opposition to the position on the culling of
raptors adopted by the Scottish Landowners Federation (October 26).
The director of the RSPB in Scotland is reported as referring to the
illegal ''persecution of protected birds by keepers throughout
Scotland'', despite the reported landowners' view that the keeper ''is
the true conservator''. It should be remembered that the keeper is an
employee and carries out policies dictated by the landowner.
The decline in numbers of some species of sporting birds is blamed on
raptors. It can equally be claimed that raptor victims are frequently
the weaker members of the prey species which should be culled in any
case and might often die if allowed to survive.
The assertions reported take little account of the ecological effects
of general pollutants and estate management policies and need much more
scientific support before being accepted as any basis for action.
The European Directive includes the statement that member states may
derogate from the provisions of Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8 (which refer to
wildlife protection) where there is no other satisfactory solution for
reasons which include the protection of flora and fauna.
Landowners are aware of this, as your report says, and one wonders why
they require additional ''flexibility to be brought back to nature
conservation''.
Many Scottish bird species are only now recovering from the
persecution by Victorian gamekeepers and the later effects of
pesticides. The support for this recovery given by the Wildlife Act of
1981 must not be destroyed for the wrong reasons.

FOR the edification of readers who perused Ruth Wishart's article in
Weekend Extra (October 28), and who might visit the Royal Glasgow
Institute of the Fine Arts which opens on Saturday, might I be allowed a
few column inches to correct any unfortunate preconceptions her words
may have encouraged regarding a painting of mine reproduced in the
article and on show in the exhibition?
The painting entitled Requiem is not as your writer supposes a
self-portrait -- flattering or otherwise -- but a seriously intended
allegorical work, where I use myself symbolically, in a state of some
undress holding aloft a bouquet of wild, red poppies, to make a specific
and hopefully poetic point.
Let me explain. Since I was born on November 11, 1933, Armistice Day,
poppies, war, and the near annihilation of a generation of young, often
talented men, remain a poignant issue my birthday annually ensures that
I will not forget! This painting is a lament and a tribute to their
sacrifice.
It is therefore offensive as another commemoration approaches to see
my intentions so trivialised by such a superficial and parochial
misreading of my work.

FOR the best part of this century there has been a steady rise in
Scottish self-confidence. This would be recognised right across the
political spectrum by people with views as diverse as, let's say, Brian
Meek and Michael Fry.
What these far from identical Tory twins would be less likely to
accept is that the more recent rise in political support for first the
SNP and then for independence is in fact a sign of this general movement
of national self-awareness.
There are many other less controversial indications, particularly in
the arts: the literary revival from the 1920s, the new appreciation of
the worth of Scottish painting and music, the vitality of the Scottish
stage and the movement towards a National Theatre, the intellectual
rigour and fresh approach of our historians.
One outward sign of national revival and achievement is in the public
monuments which express it. For example the financing by public
subscription of the Wallace Monument last century symbolised a phase
when Scottish self-government was gathering support as a policy option
and the office of Secretary of State was revived in response.
And so when ''oor'' Michael regales his fellow unionists in other
London-based parties for ''caving in'' to nationalist pressures he might
pause to consider that he only has a job at present as a result of a
previous cave-in to nationalist pressure.
No-one, as far as I know, has yet shown any interest in erecting a
monument to Michael Forsyth, although Virginia Bottomley seems capable
of wasting lottery funding on just about anything. Certainly the chances
of such a statue being financed by public subscription are about as
great as winning the lottery twice in the same week.
More seriously, if Scotland is to stride confidently into the new
millennium it might be as well to have a few new public monuments
affirming the progress we are making as a society.
Monuments are not necessarily fashionable these days -- for one thing
the Victorians used up much of the suitable street space. There is
another view that the real monument to our society should lie in the
excellence of its education or in the compassion of its social services
rather than in any work of bronze or granite.
However, if we are going to have monuments then it is as well to have
a sculptor up to the task. And it seems that Scotland is fortunate at
the present time in having just such an individual in Alexander Stoddart
who works from Paisley.
The statue of Robert Burns and his publisher John Wilson was recently
unveiled in Kilmarnock while he is also responsible for a bronze of
David Hume due to be placed on the High Street in Edinburgh next year.
Stoddart's plans for a monument to Robert Adam at Glasgow Cross and
Trongate are now before the city planning department. However, most
controversial are the plans for a statue of Scotland's Renaissance King,
James IV, for the approach to the esplanade of Stirling Castle.
This monument is part of Stoddart's celebration of Scottish
civilisation and it emphasises our deep roots in Europe. In the ''golden
age'' of James IV's reign Scotland was a creative part of Renaissance
Europe, with poets, composers, and philosophers of substance.
The extent of Renaissance Scotland's affinity to ancient Greece and
Rome is symbolised by the fact that the first translation of Virgil's
Aeneid into a modern language was into Scots by Gavin Douglas, Bishop of
Dunkeld. This was also in James IV's reign.
And because Stoddart is conscious of the powerful links between
classical Greece and Rome and the Scotland of the Enlightenment Stoddart
tends to depict his figures in robes or ancient armour.
This has caused something of a stooshie in the comments book when the
plans for the James IV statue went on public view. Perhaps expecting
their Stewart king to be adorned in royal tartan some saw the Stoddart
depiction as betrayal of Scottish tradition rather than the affirmation
which in fact it is.
If any monument is to be meaningful then it must shed some light to
signpost the future. Scotland will play a more effective role in the new
Europe if we remind ourselves of the extent of the contributions we have
made in the past.
This is what Stoddart's proposal on James IV has done, why it is
important, and why he deserves support occasionally to bewilder but
always compel our gaze.

HAVING produced the giant photographic enlargements and captions for
the 1968 Mackintosh Exhibition, I can confirm Robin Fairweather's
statement (October 27) that Professor Andrew McLaren Young relied
heavily on Thomas Howarth for many of the catalogue notes.
However, in hindsight I feel that Howarth played a much more
significant part in the Mackintosh revival. Having heard of my
involvement with the pioneer ''Friends of Toshie,'' he arrived on my
doorstep from Canada one New Year's Day morning wondering where everyone
was, and I later conducted him on a ''Toshie Tour''.
That night on a BBC TV news interview which I managed to arrange, he
expressed his anger at the way Glasgow was neglecting Mackintosh's
buildings, every one of which was under some form of threat. ''This is
the world's heritage you are destroying,'' he shouted, striking the
microphone in his frustration.
As a result the New Glasgow Society inaugurated a Mackintosh Campaign.
Eventually the workload on this became so great that, as chairman of
NGS, I convened a meeting in the rather neglected Willow Tearoom of all
those interested to set up a Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.
This was not without some difficulty in view of a certain amount of
academic rivalry which I understand had plagued an earlier group.
In retrospect I sometimes feel we created a ''Mockintosh'' monster
which is now almost out of control. I wonder if the others who disagreed
with my early proposal that the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society must
try to find a way of restricting the abuse of his designs, or at least
provide some formal approval of the use of authentic designs, are now
having second thoughts.

ELIZABETH BUIE'S article contains misleading statements about the
proposed funicular railway to replace the ageing Cairngorm chairlift
system (October 25).
The funicular will not take anyone to ''within 500ft of the summit''.
The funicular top station will be sited beside the existing chairlift
top station, approximately half a mile from the summit of Cairn Gorm and
several hundred feet below it.
The description of the funicular track (attributed to Martin Mathers
of WWE Scotland) as a ''single-line motorway up the side of the
mountain'' has no basis in fact. The rails for the funicular will be
carried on a light structure comprising two eight-inch-wide steel beams
supported at intervals on concrete columns.
The beams will be spaced 6ft apart and will run four or five feet
above the ground for most of their length. (For comparison, the existing
chairlift towers are between 20 and 35 feet high.)
To compare the funicular track to a motorway is like comparing a
longboat to an aircraft carrier.
The claim (again attributed to Mr Mathers) that the funicular will
allow ''such easy access to the summit of (sic) so many people every day
of the year'' suggests that no form of visitor management to protect the
fragile Cairngorm environment has been considered.
The facilities proposed for the new top station have in fact been
designed specifically with visitor management in mind. They take their
place within the context of a wider management plan for the whole ski
area which will allow visitors a unique opportunity to experience the
Cairngorm mountains at first hand while at the same time safeguarding
the resource.
It is of interest to note that the conservationalist umbrella group,
Scottish Wildlife and Countryside Link, has set up a working party to
look at the issue. An outline of the funicular project has been in the
public domain since May 1993, when we published our development plan for
the Cairngorm Ski Area, and details have been available since August
1994, when our planning application and environmental statement was
lodged with Highland Regional Council.
It is therefore to be hoped that the deliberations of the SWCL working
group will be based on accurate information about all aspects of the
proposals.

WHEN Strathclyde Regional Council announced the imminent removal of
the last 11 remaining police boxes from the streets of Glasgow I wrote
to Historic Scotland to ask that they be given listed building status.
After some months assessing the feasibility of this request Historic
Scotland wrote to say the structures had fallen into a state of
disrepair and basically were not worth saving.
Now however I am pleased to report that Historic Scotland has had a
change of heart and after a thematic study it has decided to place the
last four remaining boxes on the list of protected buildings.
Grateful though I am I can't help thinking how fortunate we are that
we still have something left to preserve. If the Glasgow Building
Preservation Trust hadn't bought four of the boxes they would have been
removed in 1993 with the rest of them.
Thanks also must go to The Herald, especially Tom Shields for giving
the story of the boxes' removal such good coverage.

YOUR reports on the disciplinary action taken by the Royal
Incorporation of Architects in Scotland have generally been accurate
(October 5 and 27).
However it should be made clear that Dennis G Rodwell was found guilty
of acting in a manner derogatory to his standing as a member in respect
of one specific project at 5/5a Leslie Place, Edinburgh, not about his
handling of the grant scheme in general, nor in connection with the
other projects which others have investigated.
For a ''council source'' to suggest that ''he has been made a type of
scapegoat'' is to diminish the seriousness with which the incorporation
considers allegations of misconduct.
The hearing in this instance lasted over two-and-a-half days before a
panel comprising two senior members and a senior member of the legal
profession. Both parties were represented by advocates, and a very
experienced member of the Scottish bar was appointed as clerk.
For a senior member to suggest that there is a link between the
dismissal of council staff and a clear complaint from individual clients
is misleading.
The incorporation has a clear duty to protect clients and that is what
its disciplinary procedures are there to effect. Failure by a member to
provide a proper accounting for funds held on clients' behalf is a
serious matter, hence the suspension.

A CALLOUS attacker who raped a heart transplant patient was jailed
yesterday for nine years.
The victim, who cannot take the contraceptive pill because of her
medical condition, had to undergo a series of stomach injections to
ensure that she did not conceive.
Alexander Wallace, 25, of Park View, Markinch, Fife, admitted raping
the woman on July 9 this year.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told that Wallace had a previous
conviction in August 1994 for an indecent assault on a woman taxi
driver.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the court the woman was walking
home from work late at night. Wallace, who had been drinking heavily,
tried to strike up a conversation then pushed her into bushes. He warned
her not to scream because he had a Stanley knife.
Mr Scott went on: ''She told him she had a heart transplant and he
might kill her as a consequence of his behaviour. This had no effect on
him.''
Wallace pulled down her trousers and pants, bit her on the neck, and
forced her to take part in a sex act before raping her.
At one stage during her ordeal, the victim heard people passing by but
Wallace reminded her that he had a knife in his pocket and would use it
if she screamed.
Wallace told her afterwards: ''Thanks for relieving me.'' He warned
her not to tell anyone about the attack before he walked off, leaving
her lying in the bushes. She managed to get to a house in a ''grave
state of shock'', white-faced and shaking.
The woman spent three days in hospital. According to one doctor, she
was ''almost incoherent'' because of the trauma she had suffered.
Mr Scott told the court: ''My information is to the effect that she
remains extremely traumatised as a consequence of this incident.''
Police were contacted after the incident and discovered that a man
answering Wallace's description had hired a taxi to an address near his
home in Markinch.
When police arrived, Wallace blurted out: ''I wasn't even there. I was
in Markinch all night. Is this about a lassie getting attacked?''
Ms Frances McMenamin, defence counsel, said her client wished to
express his remorse for his ''particularly horrific'' crime. ''He
couldn't believe he had done what he had.''
She said Wallace had been drinking heavily before the incident and
although he told his victim he had a knife, he had in fact been unarmed.
Jailing Wallace for nine years, Lord Clyde told him: ''You displayed a
callous disregard for your victim. You used threats to injure her with a
knife. The fact that you may not have had a knife was not a thing of
which she was aware and the threat of that action is a serious
aggravation.
''Your previous conviction shows a tendency to give way to a desire
for self-gratification with no regard to your victims.''
The judge said he recognised that Wallace had spared his victim from
having to relive her ordeal in the witness box but a lengthy sentence
had to be imposed in the public interest.

ELECTIONS provide the opportunity to choose, essential to democracy,
but they also encapsulate division, and that is an unavoidable weakness,
especially when the division is as even as it was in the Quebec
referendum. Canada continues, but the narrowness of the majority, 50,000
out of 4.7 million votes cast, leaves an impression of uncertainty. It
certainly is the thinnest possible margin, especially when contrasted by
the 60-40 division in favour of the union at the last referendum 15
years ago. The margin, and that contrast, will inspire the separatists
to maintain their agitation. It is hard to see them being reconciled, as
fellow Quebecker, Prime Minister Chretien, has wisely counselled. His
opponents are having none of that at this stage, and were already
predicting another round of campaigning and voting to produce a
different outcome in the foreseeable future. One insisted that ''we want
a country and we will have it'', which indicates little respect for a
majority. Though narrow, the majority should have been sufficient to
have settled a constitutional question: in codified and written
constitutions fundamental change usually demands a significant majority
to ensure widespread acceptance. The wisdom of that provision is evident
in this case in the marked feelings of resentment which were identified
yesterday among French Canadians, over 60% of whom had voted for
separation from the rest of the Canadian federation.
Connoisseurs of irony will enjoy one of the separatist leaders'
explanation of the outcome as a defeat imposed by ''money and the ethnic
vote''. It is probably true enough as far as it goes. Fear for their
savings and the uncertainty surrounding any new currency (or even the
Canadian dollar itself) seems to have been an important factor, and not
only with English speakers. The ''ethnic'' reference would probably be
to English speakers, for Quebec has not appealed overmuch to post-1945
immigrants from either Europe or Asia; but there is also a significant
minority of indigenous peoples in the old Hudson Bay territories of
northern Quebec -- North American Indians and Inuit who seem to have
plumped overwhelmingly for Canada and who were particularly hostile to
consigning themselves to a Canadien rather than Canadian future. This is
a point of some significance, for if French separatism continues to
flourish, a demand for some distinct Indian and Inuit provision seems
bound to accompany it. What is now Quebec is not entirely a French
Canadian preserve, and other identities may have to be considered by
Ottawa in the event of any future referendum decision different from
Monday's (though any mention of such consideration will immediately
provoke French cries of ''foul'').
The federal government will renew its efforts to satisfy French
Canadian hopes, short of secession. It is hard to see it succeeding when
so much has already been done but still leaves French speakers notably
(and obviously) alienated. They are ''a special society'' and much
legislation has tried to ensure that their sense of distinction is
protected -- indeed their special status is often resented by other
Canadians since some of it seems to contradict the plural and
multi-cultural society they value. Perhaps only complete separation
would satisfy the more extreme separatists, but any cool analysis of
Quebec's economy would show that independence carries a very high price
tag. This referendum inspired much French emotion. Is that really
enough? Any threats to Quebec's Francophone culture come from sources
independent of political sovereignty or control. These influences,
emanating often from the United States, are not deliberately targeted on
the province from English-speaking Canada. They will not go away, any
more than French speakers will abandon their efforts to fragment Canada.

WE are all ambassadors for our country. When we meet a foreigner who
inquires about Scotland, what do we say? We do not run our country down,
certainly. Most likely we dwell on its attractions, how it differs from
England, and how enjoyable a visit would be. After reading the series on
tourism in Scotland by the distinguished travel writer Jill Crawshaw it
will take an iron-clad conscience to repeat those fables. Tourism is one
of Scotland's most important industries. Computer chips will come and
go, especially if they are the branch products of a foreign-based
company; local companies in a host of industrial sectors will wax and
wane but tourism, largely because of the immutability of Scotland's
scenery, will retain its potential importance for our economy. Whether
visitors will want to come here in sufficient numbers to make this
enduring industry a success is quite a different matter. At the moment
it is not a success, no matter how many statistics are produced on
increasing visitor numbers or revenue. Visitors who come once, drawn by
Braveheart, Rob Roy or whatever, do not constitute a success. Visitors
who return because their first visit was enjoyable are not just a
success; in the light of Ms Crawshaw's experiences and those of many
visitors and would-be visitors who wrote and telephoned this newspaper
in the summer, they are little short of a miracle.
Inevitably there are a number of reasons why tourism in Scotland can
be such a shoddy, tacky, expensive, and disheartening experience. The
Scottish Tourist Board likes to present an image of slick
professionalism and ultra-modern marketing techniques. The reality is
more homespun: it is one of the most uninspiring organisations to
represent our country. Ms Crawshaw's description of the distaste with
which it dealt with the possibility of actually selling holidays would
be funny if it were not serious. The ridiculous plethora of ratings, be
they crowns, rosettes, stars or whatever, are simply a source of
confusion to visitors. Study them closely enough and you discover that
they merely assess the contents of an establishment but tell you nothing
about the actual state of the contents. Local tourist offices are not,
with some honourable exceptions, much better. Information is at a
premium despite the valiant efforts of some staff, training is often
lamentable, and at too many centres there is a distinct lack of common
courtesy and politeness. Hotels; oh that we could avoid the subject of
hotels! The most expensive are good but beyond the pockets of most
tourists. Bed and breakfast establishments are often excellent. In the
middle is the desert of the small hotel; all too often cold, dank, and
with few amenities and staff and proprietors who clearly wish to be
anywhere but in the hotel industry where they are badly paid and often
just as badly treated.
Such criticism hurts. It will be said that it consists of
generalisations, to which complaint we counter with Ms Crawshaw and her
specifics. We know that money for tourism is not abundant, but reviewing
the often appalling heritage displays and Taiwanese tat which is
presented to visitors we conclude that what money there is has been
spent badly. It is, regrettably, our lack of confidence as a nation that
leads us to render down a fascinating and varied history to the
irreducible minimum of tartan and thistle. That is caricature, not
culture. It is not sufficient to say that we have no talent for the
service aspect of the tourist industry for such things are not a
birthright but are taught and developed. If tourism in Scotland is to
succeed there must be a coherent approach by the industry and a thorough
review of its aims and functions. Let us start at the top, with the
Scottish Tourist Board.

A DISABLED youngster received a hug and a kiss from the Princess of
Wales yesterday -- then jokingly said he thought she had been ''a bit
pushy'' to have stolen the peck on the cheek.
Ten-year-old Laurence Chambers's big moment came after he had led the
smiling princess by the hand as she toured a pioneering new school for
treating children with cerebral palsy.
She was opening the National Institute for Conductive Education in
Birmingham.
The princess looked relaxed as she met pupils at the institute, which
treats cerebral palsy youngsters with the Peto method, introduced in
Budapest.
As Laurence, the first graduate of the institute's programme, led her
to her car, the princess said: ''Give me a hug and a kiss.''
Young Laurence threw his arms around her neck and clung on as she
lifted him in a bear-hug and planted a kiss on his cheek.
After the princess had sped away, the blushing boy said: ''I've never
been kissed by anyone but my mum before. I wanted to get in the car with
her and didn't want her to go.''

The collision of two warplanes rasies questions of public safety:
Margaret Vaughan examines a growing accident record
THE Tornado crash in which four RAF crewmen escaped after their
fighters collided over the North Sea happened during a combat training
exercise designed to mimic wartime conditions. Such training sorties,
held three times a year, lay great stress on combat realism, according
to defence analyst Malcolm Spaven.
''As I understand it they were involved in a joint maritime course
(JMC) exercise, run three times a year, and organised from Pitreavie,''
Spaven said.
They simulate a mini-war at sea and usually take place off the
North-west of Scotland, over Cape Wrath, the Butt of Lewis and further
out. Spaven is puzzled as to how the Tornado F3s came to collide so
close to RAF Leuchars.
''I am surprised. If they were doing an intercept, with some other
aircaft acting as a mock attacker, normally that would be going on off
the North-west of Scotland. I'm not sure why they were so close to
Leuchars.''
The JMC exercises involve armed forces from other countries. The Dutch
and German air forces are normally involved, flying out of RAF
Lossiemouth.
Attempts would be made to recover the #25m fighter ditched in waters
60 miles north-east of Berwick. The pilot and navigator ejected and were
plucked from the sea by a helicopter scrambled from RAF Boulmer in
Northumberland.
''They will want to recover the F3 to look for evidence of why the
collision happened,'' Spaven said. ''They may have collided because
radar, or some other piece of equipment, failed.'' One such piece of
equipment tells the fighter where another aircraft is, relative to its
own position.
''Whether the Tornadoes were operating as a team or against each
other, the key thing is they lost awareness of where the other one
was.''
The Board of Trade Inquiry, which was to begin yesterday, would also
want to speak to the crew members of both fighters. The pilot and
navigator, located by signals sent out from distress beacons and
airlifted to hospital in Dundee, were yesterday discharged from the
city's Royal Infirmary.
By the sound of it, said Spaven, the squad of the Tornado which made
it back to Leuchars were lucky to be alive: ''It was a pretty tough
decision to stay with the aircaft and land it, given the extensive
damage. My understanding is that the pilot was shining a torch on to the
instrument panel, because there had been an electrical failure.''
There had been a similar style of accident involving two Tornado F3s
in 1993, he said. The fighters were operating against each other over
Northumberland when they crashed. They managed to land at Newcastle. The
crew were later found to have been negligent in failing to plan the
sortie appropriately and by flying too low: ''They were extremely lucky
not to be killed,'' Spaven said.
The RAF insists that the Tornado has a good safety record and crews
support this. It is the Tornado GR1, the ground-attack aircraft, which
is more commonly used in low-flying exercises. It is four times more
likely to crash than the F3 fighters involved in this latest incident.
Spaven said the accident record of the F3s has deteriorated during the
past couple of years. ''A number of accident inquiries have found
negligence or poor airmanship, or just a lack of professionalism in a
number of cases.''
He cited the case of an F3 crash off Cyprus, involving two crewmen
from RAF Leuchars, in July 1994. The aircraft flew into the sea and both
crew members were killed. Accident inquiry investigators found that the
crew had descended below the minimum authorised height of 1500ft. The
pilot had put the nose down and accelerated to about 600 knots and kept
flying until they hit the sea. They had also switched off a low-height
buzzer which indicated when they went below a certain height.
Two other recent crashes had been the result of mechanical failure.
The last was in March off the Humber Estuary. That was found to be some
kind of mechanical failure in the F3.
In June 1994, another crash resulted from a fuel fire in the rear of
the aircaft: ''The typical Tornado F3 crash has been flying into the sea
while manoeuvring at low level. They might be in the middle of an
interception and not watching their height closely enough. Or they might
be watching another aircraft. They suddenly find their nose is below the
horizon and going straight into the sea.''
If weather conditions are such that there is no clear horizon, that
can contribute to such an accident because spatial awareness is reduced.
The stress of RAF training exercises is on ''combat realism'', more so
than would be true of the US or German air forces. Exercises are
designed to mimic conflict as much as possible.
Although complaints about low flying in Scotland have increased
dramatically during the past few months, as The Herald disclosed last
week, Spaven said the Government is correct to say low-flying exercises
have been reduced by a third.
''However, they have not reduced the intensity. There may be fewer
sorties, but the intensity has increased. For example, the exercises are
more realistic. The crews are flying more hours per year than before.
They are trained to a higher degree of intensity.
''In the past you might have had, for the sake of argument, 100 crews
doing 200 hours flying a year. Now you may have 60 crews flying 250
hours a year. Low flying at less than 250ft has also increased over the
years.''
The MoD had also effectively changed the policy on allowing air forces
from other countries to engage in low flying over Scotland. There were
now Italian AMX fighters training in low-flying exercises. The Danes,
too, have been involved in low-flying training.
George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, who has long
campaigned against low flying in the South-west of Scotland, is heading
an urgent deputation to the Ministry of Defence next Tuesday. He chairs
the all-party committee on low flying which is concerned at the 46%
increase in complaints in the first eight months of this year.
''What happens is that people's fears about low flying are compounded
when there is an accident involving Tornados. People see accidents take
place, such as that this week over the North Sea. There is a constant
fear that a Tornado on a low-flying exercise will crash into a school or
a hospital or a busy street.''
The Ministry of Defence and the RAF insist that while they understand
concerns about low flying, such sorties are operated under strict safety
rules. To have fully trained pilots ready at a moment's notice to take
part in conflicts such as the Gulf, training flights at low level are
vital.
A system used by Argentine forces to track and fire on British
warplanes during the Falklands conflict is now in use to monitor
low-flying aircraft around Britain to ensure that they obey the rules.
The Skyguard team of RAF police and a radar operator work at undisclosed
locations to monitor such flights. The system searches for low-flying
aircraft, locks on to them and tracks them to monitor height, speed and
route.
But Mr Foulkes says that while he had been impressed by the equipment
and the integrity of the crew operating it, the fact remains that the
people of South-west Scotland believe they were getting more than their
fair share of low flying.

BORDERS MP Archy Kirkwood is to lead a delegation to Brussels later
this month in talks over the exclusion of the A1 between Edinburgh and
Newcastle from a bid for Euro-road funding.
Mr Kirkwood, MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, is to have a series of
meetings in the Belgian capital with top European officials, from
November 12 to 14, to discuss regional aid.
Yesterday, he criticised the Government's decision not to include the
120-mile stretch of road -- part of the trans-European road network --
in its bid for European funding between 1995 and 1999. The decision
effectively means the road, the site of many fatal accidents, will not
be dualled before the turn of the twenty-first century.

Benedict Brogan explains why the Government is on shaky ground over
proposals for easier divorces
THE party of the family does not like discussing divorce. The
Government, which only last week was forced to dilute its plans to
consolidate for unmarried couples some of the protection granted their
married counterparts, is now said to be ready to abandon English divorce
law reform in the face of unease among Cabinet ministers and
backbenchers.
The Queen's Speech in a fortnight is due to include a Divorce Bill,
prepared by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor. He is now
said to be under attack from the pro-family fundamentalists on the Tory
back benches for what some MPs claim is a socially dangerous plan to
make divorce easier in cases where there is no opposition.
But what separates this week's controversy over divorce law from last
week's fiasco over the Domestic Violence Bill is the number of MPs
expressing doubts. Whereas last week it was a gang of eight Tories who
persuaded Lord Mackay to think again, the number threatening to vote
against the Government on divorce is at least 100 and rising.
Furthermore, not all are right-wing and not all are Tory.
The Cabinet's difficulty is proof that divorce is not an issue MPs
feel comfortable with. Like drugs, they may use it, and support its
legalisation, but they don't like to be seen in public doing it.
MPs of all parties are answerable to conservative-minded constituents
who do not want their MPs to do anything that could be interpreted as
making divorce easier. If Labour has been relatively quiet on the issue,
it is because a number of its members, in particular in the West of
Scotland, depend on the Catholic vote.
The issue was first raised last week in the tabloid press, which
roped-in a number of staunchly pro-family MPs to undermine the Domestic
Violence Bill. Eight of them met with the Lord Chancellor hours before
last Thursday's Cabinet meeting and persuaded him to defer the final
stages of the Bill and reconsider some of its provisions.
In particular they were exercised over what they claimed were
proposals to extend to live-in lovers, heterosexual or homosexual, the
right to evict violent partners. The fact that the Bill proposes nothing
of the sort, merely an extension of the categories protected against
domestic violence, was neither here nor there.
The eight -- Edward Leigh, former Cabinet minister John MacGregor,
Patrick Nicholls, Roger Gale, Ann Winterton, Julian Brazier, John
Butterfill, and Lady Olga Maitland -- claim the legislation would
undermine the status of marriage. And they are not ashamed of the fact
that Mr Brazier served on the committee that scrutinised the Bill, but
failed to speak up at the time.
Lady Olga, a fundamentalist when it comes to family matters, said Lord
Mackay should be making divorce harder rather than easier. ''If you make
it too easy it looks like a car hire-purchase, that you simply just
return the car when you have had enough or you return the spouse when
you have had enough.''
This unexpected and effective rebellion by a group not noted for its
trouble-making highlights the difficulty for Mr Major and his Cabinet.
The rebellion is an embarrassment rather than a disaster: the image of a
Cabinet disagreeing over legislation just weeks before it is due to be
announced is unwelcome, but nowhere near as bad as it would be if the
legislation went ahead only to be defeated in the Commons.
Which may explain why Chief Whip Alastair Goodlad is said to oppose
the measure because it could leave a party desperate to show how united
it is fighting like cats and dogs. The Government has already taken
steps to ensure the vote could go its way, by letting it be known that
it will grant a free vote on the Bill, so allowing sympathetic
Opposition MPs to back a Government measure.
One man at least knew the Government was sailing into difficulties on
divorce. Lord Mackay, defending his work to prepare the legislation,
admitted last week it could all go terribly wrong. ''Anything may come a
cropper. I have not rushed into this. The original matters were proposed
by the Law Commission some five years ago. I have had a green paper,
White Paper, and I have tried to discuss these matters in great detail
with everyone who has expressed an interest in them.''
The Divorce Bill would impose a compulsory year-long cooling-off
period, mediation rather than confrontations between lawyers, and -- the
step that is agitating MPs -- the end of the concept of ''fault''.
Uncontested divorces would be granted after a year rather than the
current two.
The reform is not proposed for Scotland, where uncontested divorces
are granted after two years, but the Scottish Office is keeping a close
eye on English developments.
The proposals came out of the politically independent English Law
Commission, and were backed by the Tory-led Home Affairs Select
Committee. But Tory backbenchers yesterday were pointing out that the
commission's members do not have constituents to answer to, a concern
that the Government and Labour are all too aware of.
Last week Mr Major stepped in to defend his Lord Chancellor against
criticism over the difficulties of the Domestic Violence Bill. He
rejected suggestions that he had misjudged the mood of MPs who, he said,
had not protested in the Bill's earlier stages.
And, giving an idea of where his sympathies lie, he reiterated the
Tory philosophy on the family: ''The party has been the party of the
family for as long as everyone can remember. What we are concerned about
is the institution of marriage, shoring up the institution of
marriage.''
Downing Street yesterday insisted the legislative programme, including
the Divorce Bill, was set down by Cabinet last week, and was not
expected to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. But as one Tory MP
opposed to the Bill noted yesterday, ''whenever we tamper with the
divorce law, the same thing always happens: the divorce rate keeps going
up''.

<HEADLINE>Doctor and chemist may have netted #1m. Prescription plot pair jailed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975601890</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DOCTOR Timothy Whitefield and chemist Bryan Samson were jailed
yesterday in a landmark court case believed to involve bogus NHS
prescriptions worth #1m.
Family doctor Whitefield, 49, was sentenced to three years and Samson,
53, to two years at Leeds Crown Court after the judge said they milked
the health service out of greed.
Judge Norman Jones QC told them: ''Both of you have let your
professions down and disgracefully so. Both of you stand before me as
ruined men.
''These actions were motivated entirely by greed . . . you treated the
NHS as a milch cow -- you milked it, both of you, ruthlessly.''
The court heard that Samson and the GP were being dealt with for a
#171,800 fraud but it was also told that the chemist's company, Waycare,
was being sued for #1m by the Leeds Family Health Service Authority.
It is believed to be the first sentencing for a doctor-chemist
prescription fraud -- a crime believed to cost the country #30m a year.
Health Minister Gerry Malone said the total money lost nationally --
10% of prescription revenue -- could fund 7000 hip replacements, 20,000
cataract operations or 3000 heart-valve operations.
Mr Malone said a Government clampdown on such frauds had introduced
new style prescription forms ''and it is our intention to stop frauds
like this''.
Whitefield, who lives in a detached house with his nurse wife in
Roundhay, Leeds, was found guilty at an earlier hearing of conspiracy to
defraud the city's family health service authority between October 1989
and May 1990.
Samson, who lives at #275,000 Orchard Cottage in the village of Moor
Monkton, near York, had admitted the offence.
The jury heard that Whitefield, practising at Armley Health Centre in
Church Road, Leeds, wrote out hundreds of fake prescriptions for Samson,
who did not dispensed the drugs.
However, the Leeds chemist, whose pharmacy was just yards from the
doctor's surgery, claimed cash for the medicine from the FHSA.
After paying a third in tax, he split the balance with Whitefield.
The case against Whitefield and Samson took almost five years to come
to court.
Suspicion of fraud by Samson was aroused by the massive number of
forms he was processing -- nearly three times the national average.
Samson and Whitefield spent the money on high living. The chemist ran
a #20,000 Jaguar, Range Rover, and a Suzuki jeep and admitted in court
that it was quite common for him to gamble #1000 a week on casino
tables.
He used his share to expand his business empire, buying shops in
Collingham, near Leeds, Chapletown in the city, and a pharmacy in York
-- a total payout of #710,000.
He was also a member and supporter of the Variety Club of Great
Britain, made regular trips to London, staying at top-class hotels, and
was a member of the exclusive Moor Allerton Golf Club in Leeds.
Whitefield, who retired from practice in 1990, funded his three
children through private school, ran a Volvo with personalised number
plate and, the court heard, paid #54,000 in cash into his bank account
-- #34,000 pounds of which was in #50 notes.
Detective Sergeant Peter Ramsay, who led the investigation, said:
''This was an extremely complex inquiry, particularly because of the
large volume of documentary evidence and the large numbers of
prescriptions involved.
''We were also dealing with professional people and sensitive medical
opinion. The conspiracy raises the question of whether smaller frauds of
this type can be successfully identified and brought before the
courts.''
Mr David Hatton, defending Samson, said he had been struck off the
register of pharmacists and had lost just about everything.
Mr Alistair McDonald, for Whitefield, said his client had depression
and faced losing his house. He said the fraud ended when the doctor
retired in 1990.
* It is estimated that, each year in England alone, 300 million
prescriptions are processed, making fraud detection lengthy and
difficult.

BRITAIN'S fishermen should read the small print of the European Union
deal which grants part of the huge Spanish fleet access to western
waters off the United Kingdom and Ireland next year. After last week's
agreement in Luxembourg -- hailed by British ministers as ''very
successful'' -- there is growing doubt in Brussels that all is not as it
seems.
Two issues are in serious doubt despite the political gloss put on the
deal by the Council of Ministers and, in particular, by the two
ministers who represented Britain, Secretary of State for Scotland
Michael Forsyth and Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry.
First, inside the European Commission there is disquiet at the
compromise policing agreement brokered by the Spanish, at British
insistence, which will allow a far less thorough system of checking on
the fleets of all nations than the plan suggested by Brussels. Already
there is ominous talk in the Irish sector of a looming war with the
Spanish.
Second, in the fishing communities of Britain and Ireland there is
concern that landings must inevitably be reduced despite the categorical
assurances of ministers that British quotas will be maintained.
European fishing rules and regulations are so impenetrably complex
that even the best informed can come unstuck with the detail. And so it
happened last week when Tony Baldry, new to his fisheries brief, met
journalists to explain the outcome of the talks on monitoring the
western waters -- stretching from the Shetland Islands to the Bay of
Biscay -- including the Irish Box conservation area.
Mr Baldry's performance could have come straight from the script of
Yes, Minister. He was doing well in explaining after the meeting how
good a deal had been secured by Britain until he was asked if there
would be any losers.
Mr Baldry reminded journalists that there were no-go areas for
arriving Spanish -- the Irish Sea, North Sea and Bristol Channel -- and
then he said: ''But the logical conclusion is that within the Irish Box
the amount of fish taken by Irish and United Kingdom vessels will
decrease.''
This was a plain but politically dangerous statement. Mr Baldry's
civil servant minders bristled. Even Bob Allan, the leader of the
Scottish Fishermen's Federation, looked mystified. ''I can't understand
what he meant by that,'' Mr Allan responded.
Mr Allan, like everyone else, had been under the firm impression that
all British boats would be allowed to fish their agreed quotas as before
and that catch levels would be maintained.
A few minutes after the briefing one of Mr Baldry's spokesmen
contacted reporters to say that although the minister had indeed said
what he had said, he had not meant it quite that way. Much puzzlement
ensued which Mr Baldry, to his credit, helpfully tried to resolve.
He telephoned me to explain that he had perhaps misled us and
presented us -- with no pun intended, he said -- a red herring. There
would be no British losers because fishermen would continue to fish
their full quotas. ''I can be absolutely categorical about that,'' he
insisted.
There is no reason to doubt that promise but, of course, it
immediately begs the obvious question. If fishermen in that area, all
currently fishing their quotas, are joined by Spaniards also fishing up
to the limit of their quotas, must it now follow that there is an
increase in the total fishing effort?
And if that is so, then it must follow, that an increase in the total
fishing effort means a change to the ''relative stability'' of the
shareout of quotas.
This strikes at the heart of the whole deal. ''Relative stability''
has been the inviolable principle for the British Government and
fishermen throughout years of negotiations on the terms for allowing
Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy next year instead of
2003.
Plainly, something has to give. Mr Baldry was at a loss to explain
that away. He said he would see to it that we were given guidance by his
experts from the ministry.We were duly taken aside again and told that
Mr Baldry was correct. Fishermen would indeed continue to fish their
quotas -- but, of course, the quotas were set in percentage terms and
divided up on the basis of the total allowable catch, one of his senior
advisers explained.
Put simply, if a boat was allowed 10% of a species now it would still
be permitted 10% next year, regardless of the arrival of the Spanish.
But it could mean he was landing 10% of fewer fish if the total
allowable catch was reduced to maintain relative stability. In that case
the amount of fish he landed would be decreased, just as Baldry had
admitted before his spokesmen went to work.
When the total allowable catch and quotas are set in December it will
be interesting to examine the detail. More important in the longer term
will be the efficacy of the new policing arrangements. Mrs Emma Bonino,
the respected fisheries commissioner, emerged from the Luxembourg talks
angry that her elaborate plan for monitoring boats and catches had been
unceremoniously binned by ministers.
Her ideas fell victim to a carve-up by Spain and Britain, the two EU
states with most at stake in this fisheries negotiation. The Spanish
are, coincidentally, current holders of the EU presidency. It would have
been a domestic political disaster for them to fail in the talks and
thus they were unusually susceptible to compromise.
Britain took full advantage and forced through the view that the
elaborate, computerised monitoring system which the commission wanted to
introduce in western waters was far too bureaucratic and expensive.
Britain's ministers, hounded by Tory Eurosceptics on the fisheries
issue, also had much to lose if the talks had gone awry. They, too,
needed to present the inevitable ceding of rights to Spain and Portugal
in western waters as some sort of negotiating triumph.
In the end, this marriage of convenience won the backing of the entire
council and Mrs Bonino's plan was rejected in favour of a much simpler
set of rules. But will they work? Already the Irish are predicting
mayhem at sea because the new arrangements put so much trust on
skippers.
Berte O'Flatharna of the Galway and Aran fishermen's co-operative told
BBC Gaelic programme, Eorpa, recently: ''There is already a war on --
Irish and Spanish fishermen have been at war in the south for five
years. They are ramming each other. Some people have narrowly escaped
death . . . it is not a potential conflict, it's happening already.''
But for British ministers the Luxembourg deal is nothing less than a
triumph of practicality over Brussels bureaucracy. For the doubting Mrs
Bonino it is a ''blank cheque'' for old Spanish (and other) practices.
British boats will enjoy, effectively, a licensing system involving
minimal reporting of movements and catches. Although the rules are
tighter for the Spanish, especially in the reporting of entry and exit
from British and Irish fisheries, they are nothing like as severe as the
commission wished.
British and Irish fishermen confidently expect the Spanish -- with
their undeniably dreadful record of cheating and rule-bending -- to
flout the new agreement by ignoring the rules limiting the number of
boats allowed into western waters and the Irish Box.
Whether the new arrangements are ''balanced and proportionate'' as Mr
Baldry believes, or a blank cheque for the illegal plundering of stocks
as Mrs Bonino suspects, we will shall discover next year.

THE battle against drugs is being lost and Scotland's businesses are
partly to blame, Grampian's chief constable, Dr Ian Oliver, said
yesterday.
Speaking at The National Drug Seminar in Aberdeen, Dr Oliver took his
own force by surprise saying he hoped random testing of his officers
could be in place at the beginning of next year.
Mr Tom Rowatt, deputy general secretary of the Police Federation,
said: ''It is my information that the working party is nowhere near
completing their deliberations, so for the chief constable to say they
were going to begin testing in January was a bit of a shock.''
He said testing had not been discussed nationally but they had a
meeting in early December and he was sure Dr Oliver's remarks had put
drug testing very high on the agenda.
Mr Henk Rennie, Grampian spokesman for the federation, said: ''I was
somewhat surprised to hear the chief constable come out with what he did
this morning. Until such time as we can report to him properly, we don't
know when things will be in force, if in force.''
At the seminar, organised by Grampian Police, Dr Oliver also called
for a three-pronged attack on drugs through parents, education, and the
workforce.
While commending the Government for the efforts it was making, he
criticised them as being not enough and fragmented.
He said: ''Drugs are everyone's business and they need to be aware of
that. The enemy is not at the gates, he is in the sitting room. All that
is necessary for evil to thrive and to triumph is to do nothing.''
The seminar attracted 150 delegates from throughout Scotland who were
given the message ''drugs education is everyone's business''.
Dr Oliver told them: ''We are dealing with a Hydra-headed monster and
for every head we chop off two more spring up in its place. We will
never win the battle by law enforcement.''
He said education had to start in the home and most parents were
''blissfully oblivious of the problem, as if they had never heard of
it''.
The second area for effort should be in education, with every child
from kindergarten right through to university having the benefit of
proper, informed, intelligent debate about substance abuse. It currently
occurred arbitrarily and infrequently. Every teacher needed to know the
kind of world young people lived in.
The third area was the workplace. ''Ninety per cent of employers do
not have a comprehensive substance abuse policy, which is morally and
legally reprehensible because we have such a drastic situation with
regard to the availability of drugs and the frequent abuse and misuse of
drugs in the UK,'' he said.
''If a lorry driver working for a big company is abusing drugs, and
the company has failed to do anything about that, there must inevitably
be a liability for any accidents or damage caused.
''The workplace is not facing up to its responsibilities in terms of
having a comprehensive and caring policy.''
He said that, where appropriate, companies should have a testing
policy and he felt random testing was appropriate where public safety
was an issue. He said his force would be leading by example.
''There is a unanimous agreement that testing is appropriate within
Grampian Police. How can I send officers out on to the streets with
firearms, driving high-speed patrol cars, involved in underwater search,
mountain rescue or helicopter duties, if there is a possibility that
either through the misuse of drugs, whether illegal or prescribed, the
life of some member of the public is at risk?''
Speaking after the seminar, Dr Oliver said he hoped that by the
beginning of the year more than 60% of the force would be subject to
testing. These would be through such measures as testing at
pre-employment, pre-confirmation of appointment after two years
probation, pre-promotion, and pre-transfer to specialist duties such as
a firearms officer.
''That doesn't leave much else,'' he said. ''The only testing we are
able to implement on a truly random basis is that which people are
prepared to sign up to. It would need regulation for me to be able to
compel someone.
''We may not need to resort to regulation but I spoke to Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton a few days ago and he expressed a willingness to
consider that if it was necessary.''
Dr Oliver said it would be a caring policy, within which there was
room for remedying mistakes. ''It is not about sacking people.''
Meanwhile, Scottish professional footballers, who for some years have
been subject to drug testing after matches, are now likely to be tested
at random during training.
The move has been approved by the Scottish Football Association and
the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association and was announced
yesterday at the seminar. SPFA secretary Tony Higgins said the first
test could be carried out soon.

IN spite of the huge profits made by dealers, some illegal drugs can
be bought at pocket money prices, allowing children as young as 11 to
start using them, writes GRAEME SMITH.
The economies of the drug world were explained by Detective Inspector
Donald Struthers, of Grampian Police Drug Squad, which organised the
National Drug Conference in Aberdeen.
He told delegates it was a misconception that drugs were expensive and
could not be afforded by children. A recent survey had shown that 51% of
15, 16, and 17-year-olds in Manchester were using drugs.
He said heroin and cocaine at #100 and #80 a gramme respectively were
obviously expensive but the other main abusing drugs were fairly cheap
when purchased in small quantities.
He added that seven grammes of cannabis resin cost #25 and was
sufficient for 25 reefer cigarettes, one gramme of amphetamine costs
#10, which for a casual user could last several days.
''A single dose of LSD will cost between #3 and #5, which really
brings this drug into the pocket money range,'' he said.
''Ecstasy is slightly more expensive -- between #15 and #20 a tablet,
perhaps accounting for its main user base being in the 16-plus age
group.''
He said the price of heroin varied across the country and it could be
as little as #60 a gramme in Liverpool, while in Aberdeen the price was
based on #100 a gramme.
It is sold in ''tenner bags'' -- recently 55 bags were found in a
single small matchbox -- and logically they should each contain about
one tenth of a gramme. In fact, the average was around 0.03 grammes,
providing the dealer with more than #300 for his #100 gramme.
He told delegates that dealers even sold ''party packs'' which
contained half of an ecstasy tablet, an LSD dose, a deal of amphetamine,
and Temazepam. ''With this everything is catered for, drugs to get you
up dancing and drugs to bring you down.''

Almost 10 years after the world's worst nuclear accident at Chernobyl,
moves are being made by the West to finally have it decommissioned.
Alison Daniels, who visited the notorious plant, explains the
difficulties
THE operations room is reached by treading delicately along a
dimly-lit corridor of twisted pipes and chunks of rubble. Beams slew off
into crumpled blackness. It is eerily silent. Inside drapes of polythene
sheeting shield a wall of instrument panels and an arc-shaped desk of
buttons.
One particular button, once pushed to test a safety system, has
vanished, believed stolen. The faded gold linoleum floor relects the
strange sheen of a sprayed-on polymer coating, sealing over layers and
layers of highly radioactive dust.
This is the fractured control centre of reactor number four, Chernobyl
nuclear power plant, northern Ukraine. The room where a series of
careless decisions breaching every guideline in the book were taken to
test safety procedures in the event of a reactor shutdown. Decisions
which at 1.23am on April 26, 1986, triggered the world's worst nuclear
accident.
Nearly a decade later the consequences of Chernobyl are illustrated by
statistics so large -- and often contradictory -- as to be almost
incomprehensible. In addition to the 28 firefighters who died from acute
radiation sickness within weeks of the accident, the United Nations
estimates that almost nine million people have been affected directly or
indirectly by the invisible radiation cloud carried over huge swathes of
Europe by northern winds in the aftermath of the accident.
Around half a million people were forced to leave their homes between
1986 and 1990, the majority have never returned. Over 160,000 square
kilometres of land in Belarus, the Ukraine, and Russia have been
contaminated and rendered unusable.
This week the future of the power station, whose name is synonymous
with all that is feared about nuclear power, is once more being weighed
in the political scales. They are delicate scales, loaded with
''facts'', emotion, and the conflicting agendas of West and East.
On one side the powerful G7 countries and experts from the European
technology consortium, Alliance, hoping to thrash out the details of
decommissioning the plant by the year 2000. Congregating in Kiev, they
are armed with an alarming US report which suggests that the $300m
safety upgrades of Chernobyl's 1970s RBMK reactors carried out over the
past decade are inadequate.
On the other side the Ukrainian Government, hostage to the variant
pressures of Western criticism over safety standards and a simmering
resentment at interference in a plant it now considers safe, and which
supplies 6% of the country's power. With a looming economic crisis
threatening the Ukraine's ability to pay for Russian gas, and with
enough uranium to supply its five nuclear power stations for 100 years,
the Government is demanding $4000m to shut Chernobyl.
It is a figure which the stocky Energy Minister and former power-plant
manager, Mikhail Umanets, last week described at a press conference in
Kiev as ''peanuts'', barely enough to meet the cost of shutting the
station, securing the stricken reactor, and building an alternative
thermal power station. Unfortunately it is a figure the G7 countries are
unlikely to agree to, recently promising less than $2000m in loans.
But barely 90 kilometres from the capital's conference halls the
jaw-jawing of politicians and discussions on shutdown are dismissed as
mere conjecture by those running a power plant with two working reactors
and another due to come back on line next year.
Of more pressing concern is the task of instilling a ''safety
culture'' into the minds of the 6000-strong mainly Russian workforce,
the majority of whom are recent recruits from other former Soviet Union
power stations.
Twelve-hour shifts inside windowless control rooms and vast reactor
halls are more easily borne by wages of $200 a month, six times higher
than those at any other power plant in the Ukraine.
The white cotton suited workers take a philosophical approach,
shrugging off worries about low-level radiation inside the station and
the uncertain condition of the highly radioactive collapsed reactor
four. But in the smoking room, besides the silver tea samovar there are
few good luck talismans all the same. On the wall is a scroll bearing
the Lord's Prayer in old Russian and in a corner a budgie in a wicker
cage, kept mainly for company, but yes, it is conceded, ''just to see''.
For the plant's management there is also the daunting task of shoring
up the cracking concrete and lead-clad ''sarcophagus'' entombing reactor
four with its melted core and 10 tonnes of radioactive dust. Although
designed to last 30 years and an earthquake, it is now clear another
shelter needs to be built over the top of the sarcophagus at an
estimated cost of $1600m.
From the outside the sarcophagus squats moodily among neighbouring
reactors and red and white striped chimneys, watched over by guards and
the irradiated cranes on the abandoned sites of reactors five and six,
never completed after the accident. As a blood-orange sun begins to set
the silence is broken by the footsteps of a group of operators coming
off shift and heading towards the train whisking them back to the
specially constructed workers' town of Slavutich, built to replace the
evacuated towns of Chernobyl and Pripyat.
En route the train rattles through the heavily contaminated
30-kilometre exclusion zone. Circling the power station, its pine trees
and autumn-fading grasses conceal burial grounds of contaminated waste,
sliced off irradiated top soil and the diggers and tractors used during
the clean-up.
Although the zone is guarded by checkpoints and peppered with
radiation warning signs, about 1000 former residents have filtered back
to the crumbling farmhouses among the trees. A few have ventured back to
the Soviet-style tower blocks of Pripyat where the grass grows through
the pavement and faded hammer and sickle motifs adorn former Communist
Party buildings. They are left in peace by an army that does not want to
be seen evicting elderly peasants.
With renewed world attention focused on the plant, the tenth
aniversary looming in the spring and the publication over the next five
months of three highly signficant reports on radiation effects,
Chernobyl's management has adopted a fight-to-the-bitter-end stance and
acquired a Western-style publicity machine complete with British
public-relations staff. On an almost weekly basis foreign scientists and
politicians are traipsed through the decrepit corridors of the plant to
be shown improvements.
In the quiet, hard-edged tones of a man who has stated his case to a
thousand suspicious ears, the plant's general director, Sergei Parashin,
glances from the boardroom over the Pripyat marshes before claiming the
plant is the safest in the Ukraine. ''The fault of the 1986 accident was
with the management staff who violated procedures. Like it or not our
station is remembered in world history but I would prefer that the
generation to come recall us with gratitude.''
It is a point reiterated with Slavic passion by the civic leaders of
Slavutich. Its 28,000 residents, predominately thirty-something
Russians, enjoy a cosseted lifestyle not comparable with any other
workforce town in the Ukraine designed to keep them in a region feared
by most Ukranians.
Accommodation is a variation on a low-rise apartment-block theme,
centring round an adequately stocked supermarket, cinema, restaurant,
and five leisure centres. The town has 9000 children, a third of primary
school age, looked after from dawn to dusk in schools equipped with
swimming pools, dormitories and computer rooms and with a pupil/staff
ratio of two to one.
The hospital is another symbol to the brave new Chernobyl. Its
corridors smell of fresh concrete and its chief medical officer reels
off an impressive list of specialist departments before describing the
new medical centre capable of coping with victims of a nuclear disaster.
The doctor also attributes the town's common respiratory and skin
complaints to slovenly personal health care and maintains Slavutich's
four cases of child thyroid cancer are unrelated to the catastrophe.
His views might find little resonance with the millions exposed to
radiation who ascribe illness ranging from ulcers, metabolic and blood
disorders, bronchitis, depression and leukemia to the accident. But
without hard evidence the effects on both the 800,000 liquidators
involved in decontamination work and the populations of Belarus, the
Russian Federation and the northern Ukraine remains the subject of
fierce scientific and emotional debate.
Earlier this month Ukrainian scientists published their most
up-to-date findings. They concluded that 15,000 people were unable to
work through ill health, that 12,000 children received larges doses to
the thyroid gland and that 9000 children were irradiated in the womb.
Charities like the Belarusian organisation, Children In Trouble,
estimates that a fifth of the population of Belarus have been affected
and that the number of cancer cases is growing on an annual basis.
In March the World Health Organisation endorsed the findings of
earlier studies in the Belarus capital of Minsk proving a link between
thyroid cancer and radiation and confirming 500 child cases. ''In the
five years before the accident the annual rate of thyroid cancer was
less than one per million in children living in the vicinity of
Chernobyl. Since 1991 the incidence in the Gomel region of Belarus has
been close to 100 per million.'' The annual rate in the UK stands at
just 0.5 per million.
Hard facts go little way in assessing the psychological effects on a
population who were not told about the accident or its gravity in the
immediate aftermath. The first newspaper report of the disaster appeared
in the daily Soviet Ukraine, three days after the explosion. Just eight
lines long, under the heading, ''Information of the Cabinet of Ministers
of the USSR'', it informed eagled-eyed readers that an accident had
occurred at Chernobyl. ''Measures are being taken to liquidate the
aftermath of the accident. The victims are being helped and an
investigation commission is being set up.''
Now a translator at the plant, Alexander Klesh, was a primary teacher
in the Crimea in April 1986. He remembers hearing a brief mention on
Ukrainian radio about a minor incident before gleaning more alarming
details from the BBC World Service. It was several weeks before he was
able to make contact with his family living 60 kilometres from Chernobyl
in the town of Chernigov.
Such memories render official pronouncements over the effects of
Chernobyl and improved safety difficult for some to accept at face
value. A Ukrainian study published in September concluded that
''radiophobia'' was responsible for an increase in suicides and
alcoholism.
''Fear of the impact of radiation is exhibited not only by those who
live in close proximity to the zone but also by the whole population. In
some cases this is leading to a state of social breakdown. A community
of the doomed is being formed.''
In a small, meagrely funded museum in the upstairs rooms of a working
fire station in Kiev, Sveltlana Terletzkaya shows visitors pictures of
deformed children, a mutant piglet in a glass box and family photographs
left in the adandoned homes in the exclusion zone.
She expresses a view held by many in a city spared only by a change in
wind direction. ''This museum has been controversial. People say, why
keep remembering the pain, but many of the liquidators have come here
with words of gratitude. If you ask me as a mother of two children
should Chernobyl close, for me it's hard to identify my position.
''According to statistics Chernobyl nuclear power plant is performing
the best in the Ukraine. If you close the best what about all the rest
that are lagging behind? I think it's up to the experts running the
station who should take the decision.''
Sveltlana, like most Ukrainians, puts her faith in God and experts. In
the fledging republics of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
where green lobbies are still the preserve of the affluent West, others
will have to do the same. Chernobyl is but a small dot on a dangerous
nuclear map including Kozloduy in Bulgaria, Kola in northern Russia and
the Chernobyl-style RBMK reactor of Ignalina in Lithuania, three of the
most perilous plants in the world.

INDUSTRY Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie yesterday attacked
Greenpeace and insisted that deep-sea disposal of the Brent Spar was
still on the cards.
In a speech at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, he said pollution
controls in the North Sea were rigorous.
He said Greenpeace's position had been dogmatic and emotional and was
not supported by independent scientists. Shell was still considering
every option before submitting fresh proposals.
''Any alternative solution must address those questions which led us
to conclude that deep-sea disposal was the best practicable
environmental option. Let there be no doubt that deep-sea disposal is
still on the table.''
Lord Fraser was presenting a new #25,000 environmental award sponsored
by Enterprise Oil and Heriot-Watt.
The winning project involves photo-acoustic technology to measure
pollutants from water used on oil installations.
Jointly developed by scientists at Heriot-Watt and Napier universities
and Speyside Electronics, based at Burghead in Moray, the sensor could
be modified for further environmental and health applications.

Madrid
A SERIES of murders in-
volving Britons in Tenerife has cast a shadow over a Canary Islands
resort.
Dark-haired Carole Pringle, 33, from Saltburn, Cleveland, was taken
before a magistrate investigating the fatal stabbing of her Dutch
boyfriend, Ruben de Beer, 25, at the resort of Playa de las Americas on
the island's south coast.
Police said he died during a row at the apartment where the couple had
lived for the past few months. He was stabbed in the chest with a
kitchen knife.
Pringle's arrest brought the number of Britons detained in connection
with three violent deaths in the resort to eight.
Pringle, whose mother lives in Tyne and Wear, was employed in the
office of a timeshare company in the resort which is plagued by
violence, mostly caused by lager louts after heavy drinking sessions.
Today she joined another Briton, Jackie Ambler, 31, from Doncaster,
Yorkshire, in the same prison. Divorcee Mrs Ambler has been charged in
connection with the murder of her lover and business partner Michael
O'Hara, 39, from Wakefield, who was beaten to death in the bar they
owned in the resort in September.
Two other Britons, Stanley Stewart, 29, from Clackmannan, and Gary
Holmes, 28, from Littlehampton, west Sussex, both employed as disco
bouncers and timeshare touts, are also being held in connection with Mr
O'Hara's murder.
Four Britons employed as timeshare security guards are also awaiting
trial following the death of fellow guard Andy Winder, 38, from
Darlington, who was shot and stabbed in his Playa de las Americas
apartment two years ago.

EVIDENCE in the Lanark Blue cheese case finally came to an end
yesterday -- after 20 days at Lanark Sheriff Court, and an estimated
cost of #200,000.
The closing evidence on the gourmet cheese -- enjoyed by Prince
Charles, who supports the cheesemaker -- was given by two laboratory
technicians, who answered questions on tests carried out on samples of
last year's cheese made by Mr Humphrey Errington, of Walston Braehead,
Ogscastle, near Dunsyre.
The hearing, under the 1990 Food Act, is part of a bid by Clydesdale
District Council to destroy #60,000 of the cheese because, it claims, it
is riddled with listeria monocytogenes.
Experts for Mr Errington have claimed that the tests which found
massive levels of the listeria in the cheese were botched at the
Scottish Agricultural College, and what little was contained in the
cheese is of a strain never known to have caused illness in people.
The case follows the granting of a destruction order to Clydesdale
district by Justice of the Peace Elizabeth Wilson, which was
subsequently overturned after Mr Errington went to the Court of Session
for a judicial review.
Sheriff John Douglas Allan will now consider legal submissions by QCs
representing each side, and may arrange a day in court for his
questions.
His ruling on the case is expected before the end of the month.

Washington
THE American memorial to the victims of the Lockerbie bombing will be
unveiled by President Bill Clinton in Arlington Cemetery on Friday.
It is a Scottish cairn with an inscription describing the bombing as
an attack against the United States and with the names of the 259 people
who were aboard PanAm flight 103 on December 21, 1988, and the 11 people
of Lockerbie who were killed when the plane fell on them.
Arlington is America's main military cemetery, on a hill just across
the Potomac River from Washington. Its chief feature, the house that
once belonged to General Robert E Lee, is one of the city's most
prominent landmarks.
A great number of famous Americans are buried there, including
President John Kennedy and his brother, Senator Robert Kennedy, who were
both assassinated. The president's widow, Jacqueline Onassis, was buried
beside him last year.
The Lockerbie memorial will differ from most of the others, which are
chiefly stones, planted in rigid military ranks, or a few larger
mausoleums for generals and other celebrities. The cairn's stones have
been brought from Scotland. It is behind the Lee house.
The State Department announced this week that it was still making
strenuous efforts to arrest those responsible and to bring them to
justice. A $4m reward has been offered, and details of the reward are
being disseminated throughout the Middle East.
However, the two men named in the indictment, both Libyans, are
believed to be safe in Libya. Sanctions, including a ban on air travel,
have been imposed on Libya, to induce Colonel Gaddafi to turn the two
men over for trial, either in Scotland or the United States, but so far
he has ignored them.
It was the ban on air travel which led the head of Islamic Jihad to
pass through Malta on his way between Libya and Syria. He was
assassinated there last week.

EDINBURGH is set to compete with Glasgow in the race to have
Scotland's first IMAX cinema, which has a huge ''wrap-around'' screen.
Scottish and Newcastle has submitted plans to Edinburgh District
Council for the redevelopment of the former Fountainbridge Brewery site.
The multi-million pound proposals for the 7.25-acre site include a
multiplex cinema, a transport museum, a heritage centre, and a bowling
alley.
Britain has only one IMAX cinema, at the National Museum of
Photography, Film, and Television in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The
screen provides the experience of 3D viewing.
Glasgow Development Agency announced plans earlier this year for the
redevelopment of the former Glasgow Garden Festival site and included
plans for an IMAX cinema. Millennium Commission funding is to be sought
for the #90m development on the 47-acre site.
The brewery site plans could also involve competing interests, between
Lothian region and Edinburgh District Council, over the proposed
transport museum.
The region has already contributed #15,000 towards the #50,000 costs
of a feasibility study on an #8m transport museum based in Leith.

Auckland
THE Queen arrived in New Zealand today to start a 10-day visit during
which she will open a summit of Commonwealth leaders.
She arrived in Auckland after some 26 hours aboard an Air New Zealand
plane, the first time she has taken a commercial flight.
The entire first class cabin was allocated to the monarch for the
regular scheduled flight, which saved New Zealand taxpayers #400,000
compared with the cost of chartering a whole plane.
Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard
were in Auckland to greet the Queen.
The Queen will travel to five New Zealand cities during her stay,
which climaxes with the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting (CHOGM) in Auckland on November 10.
Meanwhile, a mere 83 years after the first stone was laid, the
finishing touches are being put to New Zealand's main parliament
building in time for its official opening by the Queen this week.
Since 1992, extensive renovations have been carried out on Parliament
House, which contains the parliamentary debating chamber and offices,
and the separate parliamentary library, to strengthen them against the
hazards of earthquake and fire.
During the work, previously incomplete areas of the House, which
prevented the building from being officially opened on previous royal
visits, have finally been attended to.
''The House has been used since 1918, but the building was never
finished,'' John O'Sullivan, general manager of the Parliamentary
Services Bureau, told Reuters.
''Essentially what is being opened will be a completed, refurbished,
and strengthened building,'' he added.
A sweeping granite staircase leads to two bronze doors which form the
entrance to the House.--Reuter.

THREE hundred women gathered in Glasgow and at each of 10 other UK
towns and cities yesterday, to campaign for a national strategy to beat
breast cancer.
The 300 at each location represented the number of women who die every
week from the disease, the leaders of the newly-formed UK National
Breast Cancer Coalition said.
The coalition is calling for breast cancer to be given higher priority
by the Government and in particular for:
* All women to have access to the best possible treatment and
psycho-social support for victims of the disease, with increased
Government spending on treatment and after-care.
* A higher priority to be given to research into the causes,
prevention, and quality of life issues related to breast cancer -- the
coalition points out that #3m of Government money will be spent on
breast cancer research this year, compared with #22bn on defence.
* An influential role for women in decisions regarding breast-cancer
issues.
A similar movement in the US -- and inspiration for the UK coalition
-- has resulted in the US Government increasing expenditure on breast
cancer from $90m (#60m) to $600m (#400m) per year.
Coalition chairwoman and Talk Radio broadcaster Nancy Roberts, herself
a breast cancer survivor, said: ''For those of us who have suffered from
breast cancer, isolation is often one of the most painful side-effects.
The launch of the coalition signals an end to that isolation.
''Coming on the last day of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it will
serve as the launchpad for the activities that lie ahead in the coming
year and as a vital reminder that, if we are to conquer breast cancer,
the battle must go on all year, every year, until it is won.''
Among the women at the Glasgow launch were MPs Maria Fyfe and Irene
Adams, who pledged to take every opportunity to raise the matter in the
House of Commons.
''We might even try to get it into the budget debate -- the amount
spent on breast cancer research is pathetically low compared with
defence spending,'' said Mrs Fyfe.
Mrs Adams said: ''We need to know why it is far more prevalent in
Britain than other countries.''
The coalition is urging women to write to their MPs in support of the
cause -- a trail blazed by the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign.

The Hague
FORMER Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers today appeared to have clinched the
top job at Nato after endorsements by key alliance countries including
Germany, France, Britain and Italy.
Nato diplomats said the Dutch government was considering formally
proposing Lubbers after an informal meeting of alliance ambassadors
which showed growing support for his candidacy.
The job of secretary-general fell vacant on October 20 when the
incumbent, Belgian Willy Claes, was forced to resign because of a
domestic bribery scandal.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivered what many Nato watchers
considered the decisive nod in a statement today saying Bonn would back
Lubbers if he wanted the job of secretary-general.
It followed similar public statements yesterday from French President
Jacques Chirac and Britain's John Major after the UK-French summit in
London.
Italy also endorsed Lubbers in a statement today and a Portuguese
government source said Lisbon also backed him.
The United States, publicly silent on the issue so far, is known to
have no objections to the Dutchman, an ardent Atlanticist, taking the
alliance's top post.
''It looks virtually certain now that Lubbers will become the next
secretary-general,'' said one source at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation's Brussels headquarters.
Lubbers, who has not announced his candidacy for the job, had nothing
to say on the matter, declining to comment when Dutch television tracked
him down at a university where he is a lecturer.
Only Lubbers and former Danish foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen
were mentioned at the Nato meeting as possible candidates, diplomats
said.
Lubbers and Ellemann-Jensen immediately became the leading candidates,
but diplomats said France had privately said it did not want the Dane,
in part because he does not speak French.
Nato sources said Lubbers, who was prime minister of the Netherlands
for 12 years until May 1994, is a heavyweight candidate with excellent
credentials, particularly regarding relations between Europe and North
America.
Nato ambassadors are expected to make a formal decision on the post in
mid-November.--Reuter.

Lagos
A SPECIAL tribunal today sentenced Nigerian minority rights activist
Ken Saro-Wiwa and three others to hang for murder after a trial
condemned by pressure groups in Nigeria and abroad.
The verdict has again put Nigeria in the spotlight on human rights and
drawn criticism over the oil exploitation policies of British-Dutch
group Shell in Saro-Wiwa's Ogoniland.
Britain immediately deplored the death sentences and urged the
Nigerian military government to commute them.
The same military-appointed court sentenced five other people to death
yesterday after a trial on similar charges.
Judge Ibrahim Auta ruled that Saro-Wiwa and the three other
campaigners of his Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (Mosop)
should hang for the murder in May last year of four moderate leaders of
the oil-producing Ogoniland.
Saro-Wiwa has led MOSOP in a high-profile crusade against pollution
linked to oil exploitation in the Niger Delta home of the Ogoni
minority. Shell is the major producer in the area.
The campaign, marked by bloodshed and disruption to oil operations,
brought Mosop into confrontation with the military government which
depends on oil for most foreign earnings.
An army tank stood by the entrance to the court in the oil city of
Port Harcourt before Auta arrived to read his judgment which lasted more
than four hours.
''I was found guilty even before I was tried,'' declared a defiant but
frail looking Saro-Wiwa, who has been in detention since his arrest
after the murders. ''In the course of this trial I have been
brutalised,'' he added.
One defendant was set free by the court where special security
measures have been in place since the weekend leading to the trial.
''If I die I die for the Ogoni people,'' shouted Barinem Kiobel, one
of the three sentenced with Saro-Wiwa.
The other two are Baribor Bera and John Kpuinen.
Auta acquitted Ledum Mitee, saying he did not find sufficient grounds
to prosecute the Mosop man for inciting the murders that took place
during disturbances in the area.
Shell denies any link to the trials or that its oil activities cause
undue damage to the land of the 500,000 Ogonis. Nevertheless Shell faced
criticism after the verdicts.
Britain's reaction to the verdict echoed international pressure which
helped compel Abacha on October 1 to commute death sentences on some of
40 Nigerians convicted for plotting.
''We understand that the sentences are subject to review by the
provisional ruling council. We urge the PRC (provisional ruling council)
to commute the sentences,'' a foreign office spokesman said.
The Commonwealth had threatened sanctions against Nigeria if it
carried out the coup plot sentences.
Saro-Wiwa, a novelist and playright, held office in previous military
governments in Nigeria. He has won environmental awards from foreign
organisations for his Ogoni campaign. Evironmental campaign group
Greenpeace said Shell must share responsibility for Saro-Wiwa's death
sentence.
''Ken Saro-Wiwa has received the death sentence today because he and
the Ogoni people have exposed the devastation wrought on their land . .
. If this bizarre sentence is carried out, Shell shares responsibility
for the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa,'' Greenpeace said in a statement.
All sentences passed by the tribunal must be confirmed by Nigeria's
ruling military council led by General Sani Abacha.--Reuter.

THE former managing director of Kwik-Fit Insurance Services denied
yesterday that he had deliberately signed a form containing wrong
information.
Mr Raymond Connor said he had signed the professional indemnity
insurance form without reading it and was ''stunned'' when he was later
told it had been completed incorrectly.
Mr Connor was giving evidence at the Court of Session in a case
arising from his sacking by Kwik-Fit Insurance Services in January.
Mr Connor, a solicitor, raised an action for #50,000, claiming that
his dismissal was a breach of contract.
Previously he had been involved in a Glasgow-based firm of insurance
brokers, Campbell Renfield, which had gone into liquidation.
When Mr Connor signed the professional indemnity form in relation to
Kwik-Fit Insurance Services, he failed to indicate his previous
involvement with Campbell Renfield.
He told Lord Coulsfield yesterday that he had not read the form in
detail before he signed it because it had been prepared by other
experienced staff.
The next day, he had a meeting with Mr John Houston, financial
director of Kwik-Fit Holdings, and was told there was a problem over his
involvement with Campbell Renfield.
Mr Houston then produced a copy of the professional indemnity form,
said the form had been signed when it contained an incorrect statement,
and added: ''This makes matters worse.''
Mr Connor said: ''I was stunned. I didn't believe that I could have.''
He asked to see the form and was shown where he should have answered
in the affirmative rather than the negative a question about being the
director of a company that had gone into liquidation.
''I told him it had just been given to me to sign. It was put before
me ready prepared.''
He had not deliberately signed the form with any intention of
concealing his involvement with Campbell Renfield. He believed that his
previous connection with the firm and the fact that it had gone into
liquidation was ''pretty much common knowledge'' and he would have been
astonished to discover that this was not the case.
There was a subsequent meeting with chairman Tom Farmer, who made it
clear that Mr Connor would be sacked if he did not resign. He refused to
resign and was subsequently dismissed.
Mr Connor is also trying to reap the benefits of a shares deal agreed
before his sacking. Kwik-Fit wants that agreement set aside.
Mr Connor said of the insurance off-shoot: ''I put a lot into it. It
was my project and my idea. I believe it will make a lot of money for me
if I continue with my investment. It does appear to be successful and I
would like to get the benefit of what I put into it.''
Mr Connor told the court there had been no complaints made to him
personally that other members of the Kwik-Fit Insurance Services
management were disenchanted with him and that he had been acting in an
autocratic manner.
The hearing continues.

Washington, Tuesday
WARRING leaders headed for peace talks on Bosnia in the United States
today, as continuing reports of atrocities and ethnic cleansing inflamed
the bitter differences between them.
As the delegations gathered in Dayton, Ohio, President Bill Clinton
appealed to the rival Balkan factions to negotiate in good faith, saying
it may be their last chance to stop the suffering in Bosnia.
''We have come to a defining moment in Bosnia. This is the best chance
we've had for peace since the war began. It may be the last chance we
have for a very long time. We can't stop now,'' Clinton told a White
House briefing after meeting his team of Bosnia negotiators.
However, fresh revelations about Serb massacres of Muslim civilians
were already overshadowing the summit.
Bosnia's Foreign Minister blamed one of the delegates for the
atrocity. Muhamed Sacirbey said that continued ''ethnic cleansing'' by
Serbs in Bosnia had to be one of the first issues dealt with in Dayton.
''It's disingenuous to distinguish between Radovan Karadzic who's been
excluded from the talks and (Momcilo) Krajisnik, who'll be sitting at
the table.''
Karadzic, who is ''president'' of the breakaway Serb republic in
Bosnia, has been indicted for war crimes by the international war crimes
tribunal at the Hague. Krajisnik is speaker of the Bosnian Serb
''parliament''.--Reuter.

CONFUSION now surrounds the future of Quebec within the Canadian
federation. In 1980 Quebecois separatists were heavily defeated in a
similar referendum by a margin of 60% to 40%. In Monday's poll the
margin was barely 1%. The only certain outcome from this latest
referendum is that the issue of an independent Quebec will not
disappear.
The basis of territorial politics is too strong in Quebec for a No
vote to make any difference to the separatists' ability to argue their
case. The cultural-ethnic base of Quebec's French-speaking population is
a historical legacy which cannot be easily accommodated, even in a
federal government structure such as Canada's.
The key role of a leading elite in favour of separatism in Quebec has
played a major role in the relative success of the separatist movement
over the past two decades. This political and cultural elite in Quebec
constitutes an important core in political and economic activities that
tends to drive popular awareness.
Much has been made of the possible similarities between Quebec and
Scotland. Quebec is similar in size with a population of around seven
and a half million. However, there are two clear differences. In
Scotland, first of all, there is clearly a lack of consensus among
political and economic interests about the best way of ensuring
Scotland's success.
Secondly, Scotland's nationalist movement is less culturally based.
There is no linguistic difference to differentiate the vast majority of
Scots from those in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Even Gaelic has
never been historically a national language or culture.
What the Quebec experience also give us is an indication of how
problematic making major policy decisions on the basis of a referendum
can ultimately be. It can often serve to divide a population more than
provide a source of unity.
Of course, in many instances the device of a referendum is used as a
way out of division within a political party as opposed to the
population.
Such was the case with the Labour Party in the 1975 referendum on
membership of the EEC.
But there are wider objections to this form of decision making. There
is no doubt that it has moral force. In Quebec turn-out on Monday was an
impressive 93%. Any direct consultation of the people in this manner
cannot be without merit, even if it only results in a higher awareness
and understanding of the issue involved.
However, most Western political systems including those in Canada and
here in the UK have been developed along the principle of representative
forms of government. In other words, that once elected, politicians are
delegated the power of decision making from their electorate to use in
the manner which they see fit. Yet a referendum suggests a participatory
form of decision making which is quite at odds with the representative
principle.
It is also clear that it is a cumbersome device for decision making on
a regular basis and can act as a hindrance to governmental action.
As political parties find it harder and harder to govern modern
political systems effectively it is a device to which many countries
increasingly turn to resolve key policy questions. In Scandinavia, the
referendum is used as a consultative measure, and does not bind
government to action. In other systems such as Britain, there is no
constitutional provision for referenda and it can only be invoked
through an Act of Parliament.
Other countries have an explicit constitutional provision but rarely
use it, such as Italy. There, the 1948 constitution provides for the use
of referenda, but it was only first used in 1974 on a challenge to the
divorce laws.
In some cases its use can actually exacerbate tension on an issue. In
1950, Belgium held a referendum on whether King Leopold III should
return to the throne. Although there was a majority in favour, in key
areas such as Wallonia and Brussels there was heavy opposition. When the
king attempted to retake the throne there was widespread civil disorder
which led to his subsequent abdication.
Two European countries show more than any other merits and demerits of
the use of referenda, France and Switzerland. In France it was used by
de Gaulle in 1958, 1961, and twice in 1962 to strengthen the
presidential system of the Fifth Republic. In 1969 de Gallue was
defeated and this hastened his departure. The referendum can be used by
political leaders to strengthen their own position.
In Switzerland, the strength of the referendum is shown in two key
powers held by voters: the ability to challenge federal law and the
ability to promote legislation. Here, crucially, the balance of power in
the use of the referendum lies with the people themselves rather than
political leaders.
The referendum has had a difficult history. In many cases it is used
only to satisfy concerns of political leaders. In the case of Quebec,
there was, and still is, a clear need to consult the people over the
possible creation of a new nation-state. Something as fundamental as
that cannot come about without consultation. The splitting of
Czechoslovakia into two separate countries is a recent case in point.
The same could need to be true for Scotland. Although, at present, a
multi-option referendum would most possibliy pose more questions in the
outcome than it would answer.

Ottawa
CHASTENED and shocked by the near loss of their largest province,
Canadians today set about trying to heal the open wounds left by
Quebec's bid for independence.
The wounds opened by the bitter debate over the future of Canada were
reflected in the differing reaction to the outcome in Canada's French
and English-language press.
''Quebec divided,'' said Montreal's French-language newspaper Le
Devoir. ''Canada survived,'' said the English-language Gazette,
reflecting the palpable relief among English speakers across the world's
second largest country.
Both Quebec separatists, who have vowed to fight on, and Canadian
unity supporters met today to decide what to do next.
A chastened Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, whose political
credibility was badly tarnished by the close result, held a cabinet
meeting in Ottawa to take stock.
In an eleventh-hour bid to sway Quebec voters, Chretien last week
promised wholesale reforms to the Canadian constitution to respond to
Quebec's complaint that its French culture and language have never been
given proper protection.
''We're ready to do something that will meet the needs and aspirations
of Quebeckers and all Canadians,'' Lucienne Robillard, the federal
minister in charge of the Quebec referendum told reporters in Ottawa
before the cabinet meeting.
''So, we'll be deciding exactly what avenues to follow.''
Abroad, Canada's allies expressed relief at a vote which saved the
political and economic integrity of a key member of Nato. In Washington
and major European capitals, officials diplomatically congratulated the
pro-unity camp.
US President Bill Clinton telephoned Premier Chretien to express his
admiration for a ''strong and united Canada,'' White House officials
said.
Clinton, who had previously avoided direct comment on the possibility
of a new, French-speaking state emerging on the northern US border, said
Washington looked forward ''to continuing our close relationship with
all Canadians in the coming years''.
The president's press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton believes in
''the need to manage ethnic differences because ethnic diversity can be
the hallmark of a strong and prosperous society''.
In London, officials echoed Clinton and said that all Canada should
now unite behind the result.
''It is now time for all the people of Canada to look ahead together
and build on this result,'' a Foreign Office statement said.
The Queen, who was tricked last week into offering to speak in favour
of Canadian unity, was travelling to New Zealand for a Commonwealth
summit as votes were counted.
Officially Canada's head of state, she became embroiled in the
referendum after mistakenly accepting a hoax call from a Canadian disc
jockey. The conversation was broadcast in Canada and around the world.
Buckingham Palace, determined not to make the same mistake twice,
declined any comment on vote.
Germany hailed the vote as a triumph of democracy that would allow
Canada to continue to play its political and economic role in the world
stage.
Paris' reaction was more muted, reflecting France's long-standing
cultural attachment to Quebec as a former colony and member of the world
francophone community.
Late president Charles de Gaulle chilled ties with Ottawa for nearly
two decades by shouting ''Vive le Quebec libre'' (Long live free Quebec)
in 1967 on a visit to Montreal.
Current President Jacques Chirac said in January that France would
''stand by the Quebecois and support and recognise the new situation''
if they chose independence.

MANAGEMENT at the State Hospital, Carstairs, stressed yesterday that
working relationships with staff were good.
The comments came after Kwik Fit boss Tom Farmer, in his capacity as
chairman of Investors in People, presented its award at a ceremony in
the hospital. It is the third time this year that the hospital has won a
major award for excellence.
Senior managers say privately that a hospital which has picked up
three major awards in a year must have reasonable relationships with its
500 staff.
Yesterday, however, the Scottish Prison Officers' Association claimed
relationships between its members and managers ''were no worse than
before''.Its deputy general secretary Jim Dawson said that ''on-going
problems don't give us the impression that everything in the garden is
rosy.''
Earlier this year, unions at the hospital -- which houses some of
Scotland's most dangerous killers and psychiatric patients -- said
relationships between staff and management were at ''rock bottom''.
Yesterday, the hospital's chairman -- Mr Philip Hamilton-Grierson --
insisted: ''Our management style is now more open and based on respect
and trust but there is still some residual defensiveness we have to work
at.''

Paris
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac, seeking good ties with both sides,
pledged friendship for both Canada and Quebec in separate telephone
calls to their prime ministers today.
Chirac assured Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien of France's
friendship for Canada while saying Paris would maintain its close ties
with French-speaking Quebec, his office said.
Chirac reaffirmed France's ''position of non-indifference and
non-interference in Canadian affairs'' spokeswoman Catherine Colonna
told reporters.
He also pledged friendship for Quebec in a call to provincial Premier
Jacques Parizeau to whom he said Paris wished to ''develop direct and
privileged relations,'' she said.
Chirac also confirmed the forthcoming visit to the province at a
still-unspecified date of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
The calls were made as Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told
parliament Paris would scrupulously respect the results of Quebec's
cliffhanger referendum while maintaining traditional warm ties with the
province settled by French colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries.
''We have cared for the fate of Quebec for generations and
generations, and I can assure you we will keep maintaining and
developing the very warm ties we enjoy with Quebec,'' he said.
He said he was sending ''a message from the heart to our dear cousins
in this beautiful province . . . who had hoped for a positive result in
the poll''.

Montreal
QUEBEC separatist Premier Jacques Parizeau announced his resignation
today after the narrow defeat of the French-speaking province's bid to
secede from Canada.
''I announce today that at the end of the fall (autumn) parliamentary
session I will leave the post of premier . . . ,'' Parizeau told a news
conference in the provincial capital of Quebec City.
Parizeau said he was also stepping down as leader of his Parti
Quebecois party.
He said he had decided long ago to resign if the separatist bid failed
so that a new leader could take over the cause.
Parizeau said he regretted his choice of words in a speech after the
referendum result in which he blamed big business and ethnic groups for
the narrow defeat. The remarks caused a furore today.
Turning out in unprecedented numbers, more than 93% of the five
million or so eligible voters, Quebeckers chose by the razor thin margin
of 1.2% cent to remain in Canada. But they also served notice that life
on the razor's edge will be perilous at best.
Indeed, Canada seems likely to be plunged into another round of
constitutional strife at the precise moment when it seemed about to reap
some of the rewards of federal and provincial governments' attempts at
better economic and fiscal housekeeping.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, shifting uneasily behind his desk in the
House of Commons as he spoke to the nation, tried to put a favourable
gloss on events and urged Canadians to get on with the job of political
reform.
But ominously both leading members of Quebec's secessionist coalition
made it crystal clear that Monday's vote was not the end of the matter.
There would be another referendum and they would not wait 15 years to
hold it as they had been obliged to do after losing in 1980. The next
time will be the right one, Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard told
chanting supporters in Montreal. And it could come sooner than we
believe.
At the same time, Reform Party leader Preston Manning and three
western provincial premiers served notice that they, too, saw a chance
to promote their agenda: further decentralisation of powers from Ottawa.
Quebec voted for change, they said, and they would support that. But
they omitted the rider: that for Quebeckers change means recognition of
their special status in Canada, something that westerners in particular
are bent on withholding.
Still, early trading appeared to indicate that at least one important
constituency, the international currency market, was happy with the
result. The dollar put on a cent, making good last week's losses when
polls gave the secessionist Yes side the lead and giving the warring
parties a much-needed opportunity to regroup for the battles ahead.
There may be some sorting out to do. Some federalists, including
members of his own Liberal Party, are already gunning for Chretien on
the grounds that he complacently let slip a 10-point lead for the No
side.
The critics are particularly incensed by opinion poll findings that on
the eve of the vote a quarter of Yes supporters still thought they could
continue to send MPs to Ottawa and more than half expected to keep their
Canadian passports if Quebec became independent. If the No campaign had
been more effective, the charge goes, those people would have voted No
and the result would have been far different.
Such attacks are unlikely to wound the prime minister fatally, since
no-one wants a bout of party in-fighting just now and Chretien can argue
that he reacted energetically enough when the extent of the
secessionists' rally became clear. But the referendum result almost
certainly will put an end to the honeymoon with voters that he has
enjoyed since his election two years ago.
Quebec Premier Parizeau gave a tired and emotional speech to the
separatist faithful after the vote. Speaking ominously about the
temptation for revenge, he blamed the defeat on money and ethnic votes.
The remark brought a storm of protest from the province's ethnic
community. Christos Sirros, a Liberal Party member of Quebec's National
Assembly who is of Greek origin, called it rancorous and hateful and
said it made him sick. But many separatists also found it shocking, the
more so as it revives an image of racism that francophones have been
trying desperately to play down.
The ambitious Bouchard, whose charisma was largely responsible for the
Yes side's recovery, has announced his intention of staying in the
spotlight at the head of his 53 Bloc MPs in the Commons.
Chretien, for his part, will do all he can to undercut separatist
support in Quebec while trying to avoid the interminable and, in the
view of most Canadians, intolerable, constitutional haggling that marked
such earlier failed attempts to placate the province as the Meech Lake
and Charlottetown accords.
A clue to Chretien's possible strategy came in post-referendum remarks
by Daniel Johnson, the No side's titular head, in a pledge to Quebeckers
that he would work to bring about change by administrative as well as
constitutional means.
In the opinion of at least one constitutional authority, Professor
Joseph Magnet of the University of Ottawa's law school, a constitutional
adviser to both federal and provincial governments, every one of the
five constitutional modifications Quebec required in the Meech Lake
process could be achieved by administrative adjustments that do not
require the exhausting and divisive process of provincial approval.
The five changes include a veto over future constitutional changes;
participation in the nomination of Supreme Court justices; limitation of
federal spending power; greater power over immigration; and the
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. The failure of the rest of
Canada to endorse them has been cited by separatists ever since as
evidence that it could not, or would not, give Quebec its due.
A successful approach along these lines would be unlikely to influence
hard-core separatists like Bouchard who, his opponents suspect, hopes to
become the first president of an independent Quebec. But for many
Quebeckers it would remove much of the incentive to secede, a step that
they are clearly still reluctant to take.
In making swift adjustments, Chretien would likely have the unanimous
backing of his party. Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Marcel Masse,
for one, has said that Ottawa would have to move aggressively to
redefine the proper role of the federal government.
Author Gordon Gibson, who has made a special study of devolution,
thinks that action along such lines would probably satisfy Quebeckers.
But he cautions that it is far from clear that individual Canadians, as
opposed to provincial governments, really want a major programme of
decentralisation. He also fears that in trying to appease Quebec, Ottawa
may remove all the arguments for Canada's continued existence.
It's a fine line to tread. Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of a
bruising referendum fight, all the indications are that Canadians will
be living at the cutting edge of change for months, if not years, to
come.

Past trends and present styles combine for an individual look of
creativity, as John Davidson explains
FASHION has its dedicated followers. Their hemlines shoot up and down
like an overworked venetian blind. They have to have whatever is hot --
and absolutely not whatever is not. And then there are the fashion
mavericks, women who love beautiful clothes but refuse to become slaves
to any passing trend. They have a totally individual idea of how to put
elements together, unhindered and unhampered by the arbitrary fashion
rules of the moment.
Such a woman is the new Bohemian. She doesn't care whether particular
shapes or colours are in or out, but revels in the light-hearted
theatricality of dressing in her own completely individual way.
Like a DJ sampling soundbites from separate recordings to create his
own distinctive musical sound, this woman loves the thrill of mix. She
juxtaposes old with new, trashy with precious -- bargain buys from the
high street or treasured finds from the flea market with the costliest
couture creations.
The result? A rich melee of colour, pattern, and texture -- a personal
style of great charm.
There's something both precious and exotic about her favourite
fabrics, such as richly-printed satins and sumptuously-coloured
brocades. Exotic too are the jewels, plumes, and extravagant wraps which
complete her look.
Although many of her favourite things may come from the past, or are
inspired by it, there is something quite modern about the kooky twist
which she adds. And this is why her personal style is as charming as it
is absolutely unique.

A GUEST-HOUSE owner was named as The Macallan Personality of the Year
yesterday.
Mrs Christine Morrison of the hilltop guest house Handa in the village
of Ceos on the Isle of Lewis received the award at a ceremony in
Edinburgh's Caledonian Hotel.
Mrs Morrison named the guest house after the island where her father
and two of her cousins died at sea 37 years ago.
The award was one of six presented at The Macallan Taste of Scotland
Awards for 1995.
The event was launched eight years ago to recognise the achievements
of Scotland's ''culinary masters'' and to encourage the pursuit of
excellence in the hotel and restaurant trade.
Last year, there were 600 nominations for the award categories; this
year the figure rose to 2700.
Mrs Morrison, a teacher, said she was surprised to receive an award.
''We treat everybody as though they are part of our home and I am
honoured they thought we were worthy of an award,'' she said.
It also acknowledged the help and support given by her husband Murdo
and her mother Maryanne at the guest house, she said.
Hotel of the Year was Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel. Restaurant of the
Year was The Green Inn, Ballater, and Country House Hotel of the Year
was the Flodigarry Country House Hotel and the Water Horse Restaurant in
Staffin on the Isle of Skye.
Special Merit Award for Newcomers went to Braidwoods Restaurant in
Dalry, Ayrshire. Special Merit Award for Achievement went to the Loch
Fyne Oyster Bar in Cairndow, Argyll.

A PLAN by the Labour leadership of the new Edinburgh Council to set up
a structure of 15 committees, some of which would have more than 20
members, was attacked as top-heavy, old fashioned and Stalinist by
opposition Tories yesterday.
They were echoing criticisms by Scottish Local Government Minister
George Kynoch, made earlier this week in The Herald, who claimed it was
not too late for some of the new councils to look again at their
committee and management structures and try to be more efficient and
forward-looking.
Government Ministers also believe that large numbers of committees are
being proposed by some new authorities to ensure that as many
councillors as possible can be designated conveners and vice-conveners,
and receive special responsibility payments.
Edinburgh Liberal Democrat councillors said Labour's committees had
been organised on the basis of ''jobs for the boys and girls''.
At a full meeting of the council, Tory leader Daphne Sleigh said the
structure being proposed would mean that the 58 Edinburgh councillors
would spend most of their time sitting on committees.
Liberal Democrat leader Donald Gorrie stressed the importance of
proportionality on the committees. Eight of those proposed would have 15
members, which was a difficult number for fairly apportioning opposition
places.
Labour leader Keith Geddes denied the proposed structure was ''top
heavy'', and stressed that the Tories were only suggesting two fewer
committees.
He claimed the major ones proposed by Labour would meet only about
every eight weeks and would operate in a more modern way.
Labour's new structure, which was agreed after a vote, includes
committees of 25 members for education and policy and resources.
Committees for housing, social work, economic development and
transportation would have 22 members.

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, writes from Brussels: Commissioners
must sign up for a code of conduct prohibiting them from making money
from writing articles and making speeches, it was decided yesterday.
The code, to be published in the new few weeks, will also prevent them
publishing books unless they have been vetted by Commission president,
Jacques Santer. In some cases royalties from books will not be allowed.
Commissioners will also have to make their financial interests known
to Mr Santer.
The move follows revelations in a diary by the Danish member, Mrs Ritt
Bjerregaard, who made unflattering references to her colleagues and had
them published in book form in October.
The book was withdrawn only after passages were leaked to newspapers
across Europe. Mrs Bjerregaard was denied royalties after she was held
to have breached the rules for commissioners' financial interests.

DESPITE the fuss about the pound's forced exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday of 1992, the United Kingdom's
competitiveness has not greatly changed, it was reported yesterday,
writes MURRAY RITCHIE.
The European Commission, concluding a long inquiry into the effects of
turbulence in the currency markets, said growth had slowed throughout
Europe as a result. It put the slowdown at about half of one percentage
point at a time when, it said, sustained growth was needed for reducing
unemployment.
In the three years since Black Wednesday, which led to a 20%
devaluation of the pound and depreciations in several other currencies,
the effects have varied from state to state. Some EU nations, like
Sweden and Italy, gained in cost competitiveness. Others, like Spain,
lost. Yet more, including the UK, recorded no change, the report said.
It blamed structural factors and not currency fluctuations for the
effects on trade.
EU Commissioners produced the report after being ordered by the Cannes
summit to examine how currency instability had affected EU trade and the
single market.
Predictably, the report concluded that a single European currency was
an ''essential complement'' to the single market. ''Economic and
monetary union is the appropriate response to the difficulties caused by
monetary fluctuations to the European economy.'' it stated.

ONE of the most senior British European Commission officials in
Brussels was dismissed yesterday,
The decision to remove Mr Peter Wilmott, director-general in charge of
customs and taxation, was taken unanimously at a meeting of the 20
commissioners.
Mr Wilmott's chief, Italian Commissioner Mario Monti, said it was ''in
the interests of the service''.
Mr Wilmott was one of only three Britons with director-general posts
in the Commission's 23 directorates. His last act before leaving was to
write to each of his staff, insisting effectively that he was pushed out
of the job.
His departure, in the midst of bitter recriminations, has raised
questions about the effectiveness of Mr Monti himself, who has been in
charge of Europe's single market programme since the start of the year.
Mr Monti and Mr Wilmott, 48, have not been on speaking terms for
months.
Officially the dismissal is over ''irreconcilable differences''
involving the transition to the complete harmonisation of VAT rates
across Europe, a proposal which is already a year behind schedule.
Officials privately blame Mr Monti for the lack of action, but
publicly Mr Wilmott is blamed for failing to deliver the goods.
''It would be inappropriate for me at the moment to enter into the
fundamental reasons that led me to propose this decision (Mr Wilmott's
sacking) to the Commission,'' Mr Monti told a news conference in
Brussels. ''I would only say there is nothing of a personal nature as
far as I understand it.
''But the Commission has a political obligation to be accountable. It
is accountable to the European Parliament and public opinion, and the
civil servants are in turn accountable to the Commission. I have a duty
to see to it that this objective is met.''
Mr Monti denied claims from within the Commission that Mr Wilmott was
a scapegoat for his own failings. ''I have the responsibility to see
that the Commission services do their part to complete the single market
as efficiently as possible.''

Brussels
THE Government was embarrassed yesterday by two damning reports
showing social security support for our jobless as almost the worst in
the European Union.
Both studies, one by the European Commission, the other by the TUC,
found that Britain's unemployed were the only group in Europe without
unemployment benefit linked to previous earnings.
As a result, one in five families suffer a drop of more than half
their income and half of all unemployed men fall behind with payments on
rent, tax, mortgage or fuel.
Only the Greeks and Irish give less support to unemployed people than
the British.
Means testing -- ''most popular in Britain'' -- is criticised by
Europe as a way of saving on the social security budget.
The separate TUC report is called Europe's Poor Relations.
It details how UK unemployment benefit pay of #49.30 a week compares
badly with that paid out to the jobless in other EU member countries,
where it can range up to 90% of previous earnings.
The TUC states that when employees pay National Insurance
contributions, they do not wish only to insure themselves against
absolute poverty. They also seek to protect themselves from the
catastrophic decline in income which follows the loss of earnings.
Unemployment reduces family living standards to 59% of previous income
within three months. For 20% of families, the drop is 50% or more,
meaning essential bills gounpaid.
General secretary John Monks claimed that people were right to be
scared of losing their jobs, because the social security system gave
people less to fall back on than other European states. Government
changes had simply heightened the fear of unemployment and intensified
job insecurity.
''Our report shows Britons are now paying more for less. The
Government has raised National Insurance contributions by more than half
since 1979, whilst waging a war of attrition on unemployment benefit,
with 12 separate cuts over the same period,'' he said.
The European document is meant to assist in an EU-wide study of
comparative social-security programmes. The study will also seek to
establish whether high social support, as found in the richer EU member
states, encourages people to find work, or whether the UK approach gives
the jobless a bigger incentive to seek work.
The findings will anger the Government at a time when social affairs
are a continuing source of division between the Conservatives and the
rest of the EU.
Mr Major negotiated an opt-out from the Social Chapter of Maastricht,
a move which has caused conflict in the Council of Ministers ever since,
with Britain facing challenges on a series of employment and social
issues, from paternity leave to pay rates for workers crossing EU
borders.
The report quotes the example of an average production worker
qualifying for insurance-based benefits. If he became unemployed in
Greece, Ireland, or the UK, he would receive disposable income of less
than half of his wage. This is less than in the US. In Germany or Italy,
he would receive up to 60%. In Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands, the
figure would be more than 70%, and in France, Luxembourg, and Portugal,
it would be 80% or more. In some countries, it would remain at more than
70% for two years.
In some categories of the unemployed, only the Irish were worse off
than the British.
The report said that concentrating support on the very worst off -- a
relatively small group -- meant those only slightly better off -- a
larger group -- received less than they needed.
''Moreover, means testing is administratively costly, can discourage
saving if accumulated wealth is taken into account, as it tends to be,
and reduce incentives to work if extensive support is withdrawn as soon
as a recipient finds a job or if the test is applied to household income
and someone else's earnings from employment (a wife, for example) result
in a reduction or loss of entitlement,'' the report said.
Britain had an earnings related supplement until the Thatcher
Government abolished it in 1980, leaving just a flat-rate benefit.
Even that is now under attack. From October next year, unemployment
benefit is to be replaced by the jobseeker's allowance which will run
for six months (half the life of unemployment benefit), after which it
will be means-tested and will not be available to anyone with savings of
more that #8000 or a partner in full-time employment.
EU Commissioners approved the report yesterday.

A LOTTERY winner who used the money to buy drugs for dealing was
jailed yesterday for 18 months.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Mark Loy, 31, of Caerketton Court,
Edinburgh, had won #1900 on the lottery.
Police raided Loy's flat on July 12, finding four ounces of cannabis
resin, 25 grammes of speed and 18 tablets of ecstasy. The drugs had a
total value of more than #1000, the court was told.
Loy said that he had used #600 of his windfall to pay for the drugs.
He admitted possessing speed for his own use and possessing cannabis
with intent to supply it.
He also admitted that he had intended supplying some of the ecstasy
tablets to his live-in girlfriend.
Solicitor Mr Roy Harley said a lottery win would be regarded as a good
thing for most people, but in Loy's case it had led to his appearing in
court.
''By his own admission he proceeded to deal in cannabis,'' Mr Harley
said, adding that Loy's customers were ''friends and others''.
Loy, with one previous drug conviction, had had a long-term drug
problem, which left him with veins damaged by needles and through which
he had contracted Hepatitis C.
He was now drug-free, Mr Harley said. As the father of a
five-month-old child, he intended to stay drug-free.
Sheriff Richard Scott said the courts maintained that drug dealing
should be ''severely discouraged''.
He backdated Loy's sentence to July 13, the date he was remanded in
custody.

AN appeal has gone out to a secondary school's former pupils to mark a
milestone in history.
The rector of Dalziel High School in Motherwell, Mr Brian Miller, has
urged all old boys and girls to help compile a book for the school's
centenary in 1998.
Mr Miller said: ''We owe it not just to ourselves, whatever our age
and involvement in the school, but also to those who came before us and
to those who will follow after.''
He added: ''We are asking for help in writing this book by way of
former pupils' recollections of their time spent in the school. However,
to give it real historical value it would help if they contained brief
references to events and social circumstances in Motherwell at the
time.''
Last night a retiring old boy came forward to answer the call. He
said: ''I'm rather modest so I would prefer if you just referred to me
by my initials, CS. My memorable memories date back to the season
'65-'66, the year England won the World Cup and the juvenile team I
played in won the Cameronian Shield. We also went the whole season
without losing a game.
''They had Alf Ramsey as manager but we had ''Mosey'' Melville, the
French teacher. I think Andy Roxburgh took his cue from Mr Melville and
left teaching to make such a memorable career in football. How can we
ever thank Mr Melville?''
It is perhaps with this contribution in mind that Mr Miller has added
a get-out clause to his appeal.
''You will understand that we cannot give a guarantee that the book
will contain exactly what you wrote. We reserve the right of editing as
we don't know the volume of material we will get, its quality or indeed
the contents.''
However, there is a promise: ''I can assure you that the name of
everyone who contributes to this book will be acknowledged.''

ACTRESS Stefanie Powers yesterday accepted substantial undisclosed
libel damages and a public apology over allegations that she had
sexually harassed a former employee.
Miss Powers, 52, the star of the TV series Hart to Hart, who now
raises funds for animal conservation charity the William Holden Wildlife
Foundation, was not at the High Court to hear the settlement of her
action against Associated Newspapers.
Her solicitor, Mr Nigel Forsyth, told Mr Justice Morland that the
Daily Mail in May had published a gravely defamatory article about the
actress, who is married to French biologist Patrick de La Chesnais.
The newspaper reported allegations, made in California by her former
assistant, that she had been guilty of sexually harassing and assaulting
him in the most crude and demeaning fashion and had committed adultery.
It was also alleged that she was an alcoholic.
All of these highly offensive allegations were totally untrue, Mr
Forsyth said.
The newspaper's solicitor, Ms Caroline Kean, said it had agreed to pay
her substantial damages and her legal costs.
She said the newspaper wholeheartedly accepted Miss Powers's
assurances that she was wholly innocent of the allegations, deeply
regretted giving currency to them, and apologised for the distress and
embarrassment caused.

THE Government's drive towards rail privatisation hit another set of
buffers yesterday when the chairman of Britain's main passenger watchdog
body warned that the sell-off was a ''pantomime'' with no sign of a
happy ending.
Major-General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Rail Users'
Consultative Committee, highlighted lack of funding in the network and
said there had been no new rolling stock, track or signalling.
His views were endorsed by Scottish rail users' representatives who
echoed his theme by calling for a ''fairy godmother'' in the form of
investment.
Later, in the House of Commons, Labour leader Tony Blair asked Prime
Minister John Major to ''speak up for the British people that want their
railways as a public service''.
Mr Major replied that there had been record investment in railways in
recent years and that ''every privatisation we have had has provided a
better service''.
Major-General Napier, who retired yesterday after 10 years in his
post, said he was immensely worried about the way privatisation was
progressing.
''I end rather looking at a pantomime. Pantomimes should have a happy
ending. At the moment, there isn't a Prince Charming called finance or
investment yet in the script. So I worry about money more than anything
else.''
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his role was that of an
independent watchdog and he had not dismissed privatisation out of hand.
''But it will only work if the Government and private firms will invest
at a high level for a long time in the future. Never has investment in
the railway been less. It's half what it was two years ago.''
Major-General Napier later said: ''This Government was always going to
introduce rail privatisation but if they could go back in time I think
they would go about it in a different way.
''Privatisation could work but it's just a matter of whether it will
work better for passengers. There is no clear indication that we are
going to have a high level of sustained investment in the railways.''
He added: ''I am extremely concerned when I think the Government has
put a lot of money into the railways in terms of introducing
privatisation and for subsidies but not for investment.''
His views were backed by Mr Bill Ure, secretary of the Rail Users'
Consultative Committee for Scotland. Mr Ure said: ''There is great
concern about the lack of investment and the stalling in the programme
of station and line re-openings and improvements where ScotRail has been
working closely with local authorities, especially in Strathclyde.
''A lot of progressive schemes have ground to a halt. It is not
beneficial to the passengers. The same problem arises with renewal and
replacement of rolling stock. Where is the money going to come from? It
is not at all clear.''
Picking up the panto theme, Mr Ure suggested that if a fairy godmother
appeared, perhaps there would be the sudden discovery of a pot of gold
to fund the necessary investment.
He added that his committee had to be apolitical on the subject of
privatisation. ''We are neither for, nor against. But we are concerned
about the effects of getting there. We are travelling hopefully but it
is proving a bumpy journey in some ways for the passengers we
represent.''
Transport Secretary Sir George Young issued a statement saying he
''profoundly disagreed'' with the major-general's comments. Sir George
said: ''Far from undermining the railways, rail privatisation offers
more opportunities for stronger investment and a better service for
passengers.''
Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short predicted that the Government
would struggle to find a replacement for Major-General Napier, because
few people of sufficient calibre were prepared to come out in favour of
privatisation.
There was more bad news on the railways yesterday when the London
Regional Passengers' Committee reported that complaints to it had
reached a record high in 1994-95, rising by more than 25% over the
1993-94 total.
In its annual report, the committee said the breaking up of British
Rail had increased disharmony as the factions were now ''really supposed
to be warring''. Taking some trips on BR ''make the investigative
explorations of David Livingstone appear quite tame'', the report added.
Committee chairman, Dr Eric Midwinter, stressed the need for greater
simplicity in service provision: ''We continue to plead that if there
must be rail privatisation, there must also be a system-wide,
co-ordinated approach and an abandonment of the dislocatory franchise
approach.''

<TEXT>
A MOTORIST with a number of advanced driving qualifications laughed
yesterday as he told a court how he gave the law a run for its money.
Stephen Potter, 51, a civil construction lawyer, admitted he led
police on a nine-mile chase down dark country roads.
At Haddington Sheriff Court, Sheriff Brian Donald fined Potter, of
Widow's Row, Tyninghame, Dunbar, East Lothian, #650 and banned him from
driving for 18 months after he admitted driving dangerously on August 1
on the North Berwick-Whitekirk road and in East Linton.
He also pleaded guilty to a separate incident of driving at 105mph in
a 70mph zone along the A1 at Dolphingston Interchange on May 17.
He claimed there had been no danger to the public as he had been
driving for 33 years, was a member of the Institute of Advanced
Motorists and held a class 1 police driving certificate.
''I consider myself to be quite a safe driver. The police had no
reason to stop me whatsoever,'' Potter said.
However, he admitted having since sold his high-performance car in
exchange for a Mini.
''I curb my speed. Everyone is flying past me now,'' he said.
He then told Sheriff Donald that the law could be ''a bit of an ass''.
Of the first charge, procurator-fiscal Angus Reith said Potter had
swerved from side to side, repeatedly crossed the central road line,
sped off from a police car flashing a blue light, and drove at 60mph
through the 30mph zone of a small town before stopping outside his
house.
A roadside breath test had shown Potter to be free of alcohol, said
the fiscal.
Potter said: ''I was giving them a run for their money. I have had a
lot of harassment from the police over the years. I was getting my own
back.''
Sheriff Donald said: ''We have all heard of horrendous accidents on
the A1. You should take far greater care on roads in East Lothian.''
Later, outside the court, Potter said that he had a fleet of six cars
but would now travel by taxi.
''The morning I was stopped for speeding on the A1, I was driving a
brand-new Alfa Romeo V6155 and the night I took the police on a chase I
was driving a Daimler Sovereign,'' he said.
Potter, who intends moving overseas, had offered to pay his court
fines on the spot.
He said he had lived in the Middle East for 10 years and now was
hoping to find work in Germany or the Falklands.

ANTI-nuclear opinion was outraged last night by the news that the
Australian Government, which has spent months campaigning against French
nuclear activities in the South Pacific, is now trying to send hundreds
of spent nuclear fuel rods to Dounreay for reprocessing.
The Australian Government and Dounreay insist, however, that the rods
had all been fabricated at the Caithness plant and that it had always
been anticipated they would be returned for reprocessing at some stage.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Australian Government announced
its decision to reduce its inventory of spent nuclear fuel from the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's research
reactor at Lucas Heights.
''Accordingly, the government intends to make full use of
international opportunities to reduce the inventory of research reactor
spent fuel. The government has authorised Ansto to negotiate terms for
shipment of spent fuel of UK origin to Britain for reprocessing, which
involves recovery of valuable unused uranium for peaceful, non-military
purposes.
''The UK origin spent fuel comprises about half the current holdings
at Lucas Heights.''
A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay said yesterday
that the plant had been supplying these rods to Australia for 30 years
and had always expected to have them sent back for reprocessing.
''Australia does not have reprocessing facilities. We would stress,
however, that any irradiated waste produced will be returned to
Australia, as there would have been no waste associated with the rods
when they were originally sent.''
He would not say what the total cargo would be but insisted it would
be nothing like 800 rods. ''For us to proceed, HM Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate will have to renew our discharge authorisations and the
Department of Trade and Industry will have to give its permission.''
HMIPI is due to begin its public consultations on Dounreay discharge
authorisations in the New Year, while the DTI is planning to open
discussions with their Australian counterparts in a few weeks.
However, Mr Peter Roche of Greenpeace UK said yesterday: ''The
Australians have a perfectly good storage facility at their research
reactor near Sydney, so there is no need at all for them to do this. It
is a bit ironic that they are sending this atomic waste here, especially
with their government being so critical of Prime Minister John Major's
support for the French nuclear bomb tests at Muroroa Atoll in the South
Pacific.''
Mrs Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, meanwhile
warned: ''We had better get used to this, because this is how it is
going to be every day, every week, as the queue forms around the world
of nations wanting to get rid of their nuclear waste. And all the time
our Government is encouraging Dounreay so that they can offset the
hundreds of millions they will have to pay to clean up Dounreay in
decommissioning. Where on earth does it all leave the 'polluter pays'
principle?''

<TEXT>
AN educational ''hit squad'' yesterday ordered the closure of a
troubled school.
It was the first time the Government had employed its ultimate weapon
against a school judged by inspectors to be failing to provide adequate
education for pupils.
Only 10 days of statutory consultation now separate Hackney Downs
school in London's East End from closure at the end of the year.
Its 40 teachers face redundancy and its 200 boys transfer to another
school in Hackney.
The North-east London Educational Association was sent into the school
in July, removing it from the control of Hackney education authority.
Association chairman Richard Painter was blunt, declaring that ''the
boys of Hackney Downs School are being short-changed by the quality of
education provided and, the sooner closure takes place, the better for
the boys''.
He condemned many teachers for coming to accept that low standards of
achievement by pupils were ''the norm''.
The report also blamed a poor school environment, and the
''uncontrolled behaviour of some boys''.
The school had more than adequate resources, with nearly #6500 being
spent on each pupil and a pupil-teacher ratio of approximately
eight-to-one.
A closure on the Hackney Downs model could not happen in Scotland.
Here, schools are inspected on a rolling programme by teams of Scottish
Office HM Inspectors augmented by lay members.
Heads are consulted at various stages of the inspection process and,
if in their final report the inspectors find matters which require to be
tackled, they identify them and will return to the school for a
follow-up inspection about one year later.
In each of the follow-up inspections to date, inspectors have been
satisfied that issues they raised had been tackled.
The local Labour MP, Diane Abbot, said there was no need for the
school to close. ''Local people, children, and teachers wanted to keep

THE Divorce Reform Bill, officially scheduled for legislation next
year, seemed doomed last night.
Without the personal backing of the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor
Lord Mackay's plans look like being shelved.
Tory Ministers and a cross section of back benchers believe that the
issue is too dangerous to touch in the run-up to a General Election,
despite churches south of the Border giving Lord Mackay's White Paper a
fair wind.
Lord Mackay insists that his intentions are not to make divorce easier
but to reduce the suffering caused. The Cabinet has agreed his Bill for
the Queen's Speech next month but this is subject to the legislative
timetable which has still to be resolved by the Cabinet committee
dealing with public expenditure. The full Cabinet is scheduled to decide
this tomorrow and only then will Lord Mackay know whether his Bill is to
be delayed.
If it is, it will be a strictly political rather than ethical decision
explained on the grounds that more urgent Bills with greater financial
implications are pressing.
A Divorce Reform Bill could split the Tories in the Commons at a time
when unity is essential if there is to be a chance of a General Election
next year.
This has produced a bizarre situation in which the Labour Party might
support Lord Mackay's Bill, which would impose a 12-month cooling-off
period for uncontested divorces.
However, the Tories are concerned that the Bill would give the public
the impression the Government is trying to make divorce easier.
The Prime Minister deeply distrusts the Labour Party -- even in a
''free'' vote -- after the late Labour leader John Smith almost trapped
him on the contentious Maastricht Treaty Bill. Cabinet Ministers fear
the new Labour leader Tony Blair might use any parliamentary tactic to
bring down the Government.
Lord Mackay signalled the likelihood that his legislation could be
delayed when he said a fortnight ago: ''Anything may come a cropper. The
original matters were proposed by the Law Commission five years ago.''
One of his problems is that Tory back benchers do not trust the
independent Law Commission which they see as being dominated by
left-wing radical lawyers.

TV magician Paul Daniels described new-style entertainers as
''amateurs'' yesterday after the BBC dismissed his idea for a Christmas
special as ''old hat''.
On November 15, Mr Daniels begins a new series called Secrets, set in
a nightclub, with the BBC.
However, he claimed an idea for a Christmas special featuring his wife
Debbie McGee, son Martin, and brother Trevor -- ''the sort of family
show that Andy Williams used to do'' -- was ruled out.
The performer, who is rehearsing pantomime in York, added: ''The BBC
said no. Bluntly, that it was old-fashioned and old hat.''
He continued: ''What they don't realise is that 40% of the people in
this country are over 45-years-old and they don't want the so-called
alternative comedians and some of the other stuff that constantly gets
on television.
''I am tired of seeing amateurs and I want to see a few
professionals.''
Mr Daniels's outburst follows similar comments by former Generation
Game host Bruce Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth called BBC management ''faceless bureaucrats who know
nothing about family entertainment''.
Mr Daniels, who has worked with the BBC for more than 20 years -- also
confirmed that his contract is soon up for renewal.
He explained: ''My contract with the BBC is up at Christmas and after
that, any company that wants my services can have them, if the price is
right.''
A BBC spokeswoman said she had no knowledge of Mr Daniels making an
approach about a Christmas special.
She added: ''There was never going to be a Christmas special within
the context of his new series Secrets, because then we cannot use them
in repeats.''
Mr Daniels also passed comment on several well-known TV performers:
* David Copperfield: ''Lovely man, only does one show to our 10, so I
am certainly the most prolific.''
* Hale and Pace: ''I do think they sometimes go a bit too far. All
very funny and then they step over the line.''
* The Generation Game: ''Nothing against Jim Davidson, but crickey,
it's been going on for decades and I think people are pretty tired of
it.
''There's only so many times you can see contestants dancing with a
Ukrainian troupe.''
* The Mrs Merton Show: ''I shall be around long after she's gone. I do
hope that Caroline Hook is astute enough to drop the character at some
point.
''Part of it is that accent from Lancashire, too much of that and you
want to throttle the talker.''

THE Duke of Northumberland, reputed to be Britain's wealthiest and
most eligible bachelor, has died, aged 42.
His agent, Mr Rory Wilson, confirmed last night that Henry Percy, the
11th Duke of Northumberland, whose 100,000-acre estate included the
spectacular Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, died peacefully in his
sleep at his other home, Syon House, Brentford, Middlesex.
Educated at Eton and Oxford, the duke had been in poor health for many
years and had spoken of an ME-type illness from which he said he had
been suffering since he was a history undergraduate.
In a newspaper interview last December, he told how he started feeling
poorly and always felt tired and out of sorts, although there had
apparently been nothing to explain it.
''Looking back, I think I was one of the first people in the country
to suffer from ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis),'' he said. ''I became
clinically depressed. I always felt sleepy, I couldn't eat, my weight
went down to eight stones. I was very low.''
Although publicity shy, the duke -- whose godmother was the Queen --
was photographed in the company of glamorous women, such as former Bond
girl Barbara Carrera, and Valerie Campbell, mother of supermodel Naomi,
at showbiz occasions.
BusinessAge magazine claimed in September that the duke was Britain's
wealthiest bachelor, with a fortune of #250m.
However, other sources estimated that the duke, listed as the
country's 63rd richest man, had a fortune of only #146m. It was claimed
two years ago that his wealth had been pegged back to #60m as a result
of the recession.
Scotland Yard said a post- mortem examination would take place today.
Police are not treating his death as suspicious.

<HEADLINE>Referendum result spills over into political row on nationalism. Quebec divides Scots</HEADLINE>

HOURS after Quebec narrowly rejected independence from Canada, Labour
and Conservative politicians inScotland united in using the result to
condemn ''dark'' and ''sinister'' aspects of nationalism.
Their comments were derided by the SNP and provoked an angry response
from the London representative of the Canadian province.
In a turnout of 93%, the people of Quebec voted 50.6% to 49.4% to
remain part of Canada. So close was the referendum call, the obvious
frustration of some separatists among the widespread displays of elation
and despair spilled over into violence. It also forced the resignation
of Quebec separatist Premier Jacques Parizeau.
The passionate arguments of an occasionally bitter campaign found
immediate echoes on this side of the Atlantic.
Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst, in a letter to Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson challenging Labour on the idea that
a new constitutional settlement would silence demands for further
change, said developments in Quebec confirmed ''there is indeed a
sinister side to nationalism which must have no place in the democratic
process''.
Mr Robertson wrote back pointing out that Canadian Tories had been
reduced to two seats in the federal parliament, and drawing attention to
an Early Day Motion by Cumbernauld and Kilsyth MP Norman Hogg. This
stated Mr Parizeau had ''pandered to that darker side of nationalism
which must always be defeated''.
Comments about the alleged damage to Quebec's economy also angered its
Agent General in London, Mr Richard Guay, who said: ''I deeply resent
that the issue of Quebec is being used as a party political footbal by
politicians in Scotland to justify their respective positions on the
constitution there.''
Sir Michael had referred to ''a further exodus of jobs and
investment'' from Quebec. Mr Robertson had said: ''The key warning of
Quebec to the Scottish people is the economic damage done by the
uncertainty involved in trying to wrench apart a long-integrated
economy.''
Mr Guay said the Quebec economy grew by 3.9% last year and was
outstripping most OECD countries, including Britain.
''Mr Robertson has a reputation as a serious and thorough MP and I am
at a bit of a loss as to why he should make such statements,'' he said.
Labour stood by its suggestion that in recent days there had been a
fall in share prices and pressure on the Canadian dollar as a result of
the constitutional uncertainty.
While Labour and Conservatives argued over whether or not the Canadian
experience showed constitutional change was a slippery slope, SNP leader
Alex Salmond said at least the people of Quebec had been allowed to
exercise their right to self-determination.
He said: ''If fully-fledged federalism can barely contain Quebec
within Canada, then Labour's watered-down devolution scheme would prove
far less able to meet the national aspirations of Scotland which, unlike
Quebec, has an ancient tradition of nation statehood.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said the real
lesson was that when it came to the crunch the people of Quebec had
opted for interdependence, rather than independence.
Conservatives focused on the fact that Quebec separatists, in spite of
having strong federal autonomy, have vowed to continue to fight to
secede from Canada. ''The experience of Quebec provides clear evidence
that devolution does not appease nationalists,'' Sir Michael wrote to Mr
Robertson. ''In the light of this, do you still stand by your belief
that devolution for Scotland would kill nationalism stone dead?''
Mr Robertson responded. ''Are you seriously suggesting that no
decentralisation should have occurred in Canada and that this would have
spared them the turbulence of recent years?''

A PRIVATE developer whose offer for a prestigious property was far
greater than those of rivals, has asked Scottish Office Ministers to
intervene over the Post Office's decision to seek fresh bids.
Aberdeen-based Jarlaw offered #4.5m -- compared with #3m by Glasgow
Development Agency, which wants the building for a new National Gallery
of Scottish Art and Design, and a #3.5m bid from another private
developer.
The decision to defer a final decision was taken just hours before the
successful bidder was due to be named -- and accompanied by a new
stipulation which reduces retail and office floor space by 20,000sq ft,
and cuts the building's commercial value in George Square, Glasgow.
Jarlaw will, if necessary, consider legal action against the Post
Office, arguing it has been prejudiced, treated unfairly, and ''in a
manner not normally associated with the disposal of surplus Government
property''.
It is furious that the #4.5m bid, lodged in confidence, reached the
public domain before last month's original closing date.
The firm also suspects another office and retail developer has since
used that information to submit an improved offer, and fears the tender
process now amounts to a public auction.
Jarlaw's solicitors have raised three ''key areas of concern'' in a
letter to Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch. In effect, the firm
wants any sale blocked until all concerns have been eliminated or at
least explained to its satisfaction.
The letter, received anonymously by The Herald, seeks Government
intervention on ''an extremely unsatisfactory situation'' after the firm
was told it was both front runner and highest bidder before the original
closing date.
Key complaints include the publicly-funded GDA pursuing a bid on
behalf of gallery trustees when there is no guarantee that funding for
the gallery will be secured.
The letter warns the GDA could be left with a building which, in the
private sector, would be developed much faster, creating jobs earlier.
It also protests that the identification of Jarlaw and its bid price
was ''unique and wholly unacceptable'' in a tender process, and that it
would appear both city council planning and grant matters had been
pre-judged.
The letter is sceptical of the ''surprising'' new stipulation that a
philatelic museum must be provided by the successful bidder.
Mr Kynoch is told it would be ''easy to conclude that its inclusion
provided a convenient justification to invite new bids, and implies a
confidence that better bids will be forthcoming.''
The letter adds that Jarlaw is ''extremely uncomfortable'' over
discussions continuing with other parties after it had satisfied
original criteria over both its scheme and funding.
A new closing date -- noon this Friday -- was fixed by the Post Office
on grounds of exceptional interest and wide-ranging proposals for the
prestige city centre building.
That decision has bouyed supporters of the gallery plan, including
Glasgow District Council leader Pat Lally.
He said yesterday: ''The Post Office, as a public body, has public as
well as financial responsibilities.''
The Post Office stressed it had neither commented on the number of
bids nor revealed details or figures.
A GDA spokesman said a national gallery would have a major economic
impact on the city, and it had been working closely with the trustees
and partners to bring it to fruition.
Jarlaw's confirmed a letter had been sent, but declined to comment
further. The Scottish Office said a response to the firm will be made in
due course.

A SIGNIFICANT challenge was laid down last night to Labour MP George
Galloway after a nomination meeting voted in favour of selecting a
female candidate to represent the party at the next General Election in
the new Glasgow Kelvin seat.
The new seat will take in Mr Galloway's Hillhead constituency and part
of Glasgow Central under a parliamentary boundary review.
Ms Shiona Waldron, a depute procurator-fiscal in Dumbarton, polled 42
votes against Mr Galloway's 29 at a nomination meeting of the
Hillhead/Hyndland branch of the Labour Party. The previous night she had
been nominated by the women's section of the Glasgow Kelvin constituency
ahead of Mr Galloway by 21 votes to 10.
Ms Waldron is vice chair of Labour's Kelvin West branch and is
expected to win that nomination.
However, although last night's defeat for Mr Galloway represents a
blow to his reselection hopes, senior party sources indicated that all
was not necessarily lost for the MP, who was elected in 1987. Two other
branches of the new constituency and up to five trade unions have still
to cast their votes.
Ms Waldron was at the centre of controversy six years ago over the
running of Jordanhill School. She resigned as convener of the school's
board of management, after becoming disillusioned with the way in which
the school was being run, along with the vice-convener, Mr Alan Cowie.
This had followed the earlier resignation of the school's headteacher,
Mr Alistair Cram.
Ms Waldron, 44, unsuccessfully stood against Labour Chief Whip Donald
Dewar for the Glasgow Garscadden seat in the 1978 General Election under
the banner of the breakaway Scottish Labour, which was led then by Jim
Sillars. She had stood under her then married name of Shiona Farrell.
A senior party source said: ''The result indicates a more serious
challenge will be mounted against George than was first anticipated.
However, I still can't see him being defeated.''
Neither Ms Waldron nor Mr Galloway could be contacted for comment last
night.

THE German government's principal representative in Britain yesterday
warned the UK it would have to consider giving up its European Union
veto in certain circumstances and, at the very least, be prepared to
give ''loyal support'' to majority decisions.
In a thinly-veiled attack on Conservative Euro-sceptics during a visit
to Glasgow, Dr Jurgen Oesterhelt, the German Ambassador to Britain, said
there was no alternative to majority decisions if the EU was to act more
effectively and present a united front to the world.
His comments were immediately rejected by Sir Teddy Taylor MP, one of
the leading Tory Euro-sceptics, who said the ambassador should be aware
of a rising tide of concern about EU powers and warned of a ''bust-up''
at next year's Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) if more is demanded of
member states.
Appealing to what he called ''the pragmatism of the British'', Dr
Oesterhelt said national prestige must give way to the need to increase
the effectiveness of EU institutions, adding it was inevitable in a
growing community that the influence of members would decline.
He recognised that the national veto was a sensitive subject in
Britain, but said the EU must prevent ''isolated positions'' leading to
misuse of consensus.
He added: ''Majority decisions in the field of foreign policy must no
longer be taboo. With 15, or in future even more partners, insistence on
unanimity would time and again lead to a decision based on the lowest
common denominator, which would no longer be heeded by the outside
world.''
At a luncheon organised by the German-British Chamber of Industry and
Commerce, he said: ''European integration and the Single Market would
have been inconceivable without majority voting.''
He added that ''all partners must be prepared to give their loyal
support, financially at least, to whatever the majority has decided.
Even if it stays out and says 'No, this is too difficult for us, we
can't sell it to the public'.''
Sir Teddy said he hoped the ambassador appreciated that the Maastricht
Treaty went through Parliament only on the strict understanding that
foreign affairs and defence would be matters entirely for member states.
Dr Oesterhelt stressed in his Glasgow address that there was consensus
among all EU partners that the foreign deployment of troops must remain
at the discretion of individual states, and said he wanted to make this
clear in view of recent comments by ''a well-known politician in this
country''.
He was apparently referring to controversial Euro-sceptic comments
made by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo at the Tory party conference
last month, when he said Britain would never join a European army and
would not accept any limitation on its freedom to act in defence of
Britain's national interests.
Dr Oesterhelt outlined his government's four basic objectives for the
IGC, which will seek to establish ways of making the EU more effective
and democratic:
* A common European foreign and security policy ''worthy of the
name'', while in the longer term that policy will have to be
complemented by a European security and defence identity.
* A progressive increase of collective action in the field of justice
and home affairs.
* A review of the European institutions and their decision-making
process with a view to greater effectiveness.
* An effort to bring European decisions closer to the citizens,
meaning more transparency and strict application of the principle of
subsidiarity.

CAMPAIGNERS against a proposed interconnector to carry electricity
from Scotland to Northern Ireland were last night claiming a victory
after calls in the European Parliament for new investigations.
The plan by ScottishPower and Northern Ireland Electricity has been
the subject of lengthy public inquiries either side of the North
Channel.
These inquiries have yet to report but MEPs said yesterday they were
concerned and called for more information.
The objections are chiefly on safety and environmental grounds. The
power companies argue that the #165m project is safe and essential to
the economies of both areas.
The interconnector would be carried 40 miles on pylons across South
Ayrshire and by an undersea cable to the Antrim coast.
MEPs from Ireland, Scotland, and England yesterday called for detailed
reports to be drawn up by the budgetary control, environment, and energy
committees of the European Parliament. The European Commission has
pledged #61m in grant aid.
Mr Alex Smith, South of Scotland MEP, said last night: ''I am
extremely concerned about many aspects of this project, not least the
damage to the environment which may be caused by undersea working in the
light of the recent spate of munitions being washed up following work
done for British Gas.
''There are also strong indications that the deal between these two
companies may force up electricity prices in the province, already among
the highest in the world, and threaten jobs.''
Irish MEP Mary Banotti rejected Commission suggestions that the #61m
grant could not be reviewed.
She argued that there could be a reversal because the go-ahead had not
been given and construction work had not started.
Mr Roy Perry, MEP for Wight and Hampshire South, called for a review
of the project and for each of the three committees to appoint a
rapporteur -- a suggestion which won the unanimous backing of his
colleagues.
Mr Struan Stevenson, co-ordinator of the Stop the Overhead Pylons
campaign, said: ''This is a major breakthrough. The objectors are once
again on the march and the supporters of the interconnector, namely the
big utility giants ScottishPower and NIE, are on the retreat.
''The MEPs . . . are now asking why large amounts of taxpayers' money
should be spent on a project which would devastate the environment and
threaten the economic future of Northern Ireland.''
A spokesman for ScottishPower said: ''We have made our position quite
clear at two public inquiries and have had the backing of the European
Commission in the form of a substantial grant to Northern Ireland to
assist with the interconnector.
''We welcome any fresh look being taken at the project which we are
confident will again demonstrate the soundness of the project.''

THE boxing world was in mourning last night after the death on Monday

Messages of sympathy poured into the Watts' home as the boxer and his
wife, Margaret, tried to come to terms with losing their 17-year-old
son, Jim Jnr, who was killed instantly in a car crash.
Both parents were yesterday too distraught to speak about the tragedy,
and curtains remained drawn at their home in Kirkintilloch, outside
Glasgow.
Family members and close friends comforted the former boxer and his
wife at the house in Northbank Road, where neighbours took their turn to
visit and offer condolences.
One family friend said that Jim Jnr had only recently taken his
driving test, having been coached by his father, who now runs a car hire
and wedding business.
The head-on collision occured outside the town, on the Kilsyth to
Kirkintilloch road, at about 10pm. The other driver, Ms Jane Martin, 30,
of Briarneuk, Bishopbriggs, sustained internal injuries and is
''stable'' in Stobhill Hospital, where she is expected to remain for
several days.
Last night, the sister of Gordon Stevenson, 16, who was in the car
with Jim Jnr, but was allowed home from hospital after being treated for
cuts and bruising, said her brother was ''devastated''.
She said: ''Gordon is in shock, James was his best friend.''
The Watt family tragedy comes just three weeks after the boxing world
was rocked by the death of Jim Murray after a British bantamweight title
fight in Glasgow.
Mr Terry Lawless, formerly Jim Watt's manager, said: ''Jim and
Margaret will be devastated and our thoughts are with them.''
Promoter Tommy Gilmour also said his thoughts were with the Watts and
their other children, Andrew, 26, and Michelle, 18.
Last night, the town of Kirkintilloch was mourning its favourite son.
One man, who runs a local scrapyard, said: ''I remember one day young
Jim was fooling about in the yard.
''His dad came around and grabbed the youngster by the scruff of his
neck. But instead of taking him home, he made Jim come and aplogise to
me.
''It showed how Jim Watt taught his kids manners and respect. The town
is right behind the Watt family at this time.''

MILLIONAIRE bachelor, film producer, and actor, a football club named
after his family, boyfriend to Bond Girls -- Henry Alan Walter Richard
Percy, the 11th Duke of Northumberland, who died in his sleep at the age
of 42 yesterday, was one of a rare breed even excepting the bluest of
blue blood which pulsed through his veins during his short life.
Owner of the sumptuous 100,000-acre estate which stretched from his
home at Alnwick Castle throughout north Northumberland, the duke's name
and family go back 900 years to the time when a distant and noble
ancestor arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror. The Queen was
the 11th Duke's godmother.
Most famous of the family was Henry Percy or Harry Hotspur, a rebel
celebrated in Shakespeare's Henry IV who led an uprising which came
within a whisker of dethroning the British monarchy in the fourteenth
century.
The latest Henry Percy inherited much of his forefathers' aptitude for
the colourful and dramatic.
In September, he was celebrated as Britain's most eligible bachelor in
a survey by BusinessAge magazine, way ahead of the rest of the field.
The publication put his fortune at around #275m although more sober
estimates were closer to #100m.
However, the duke courted controversy two years ago by instigating a
series of redundancies at his estate, including the #170-a-week groom
amid claims his fortune had dwindled to under #60m.
Regardless, the duke led a vivid and opulent life, the bones of which
were much picked over in the gossip columns of London newspapers.
His most famous girlfriend was the Nicuraguan actress Barbara Carrera,
the Bond Girl in Never Say Never Again, in a relationship which lasted
four years.
He was most recently seen stepping out at society functions with
Valerie Campbell, the mother of supermodel Naomi and latterly a model in
her own right.
Over the years, his estate at Alnwick has also been a star, used in
many fims including the Kevin Costner blockbuster Robin Hood Prince of
Thieves and the Stewart Granger film Moonfleet.
As recently as last December, the duke appeared in the flesh to be
very fair and very boyish, although in photographs he usually looked
older and plumper, more akin to the traits of middle age.
He explained in a newspaper interview last December how he suffered
from classic ME symptoms -- pains in his head and back and long spells
during which he was overwhelmed by tiredness.
At the time, he was awaiting the results of blood tests which he hoped
would reveal exactly what was wrong.
He went to school at Eton, and, as a shy, studious, unaffected, and
very thin young man, to Christ Church, Oxford to read history.
He was very keen on squash and tennis and harboured hopes of becoming
a professional tennis player. However, in his final year at university,
he started feeling poorly, always tired, out of sorts.
Several experts who were consulted tried various treatments but
generally remained baffled at his symptoms. Some people suggested the
ailment was in his mind. Various treatments, drugs and diets found no
solution.
The duke said in a newspaper article last December: ''Looking back, I
think I was one of the first people in the country to suffer from ME
(myalgic encephalomyelitis). I became clinically depressed. I always
felt sleepy, I couldn't eat, my weight went down to eight stone. I was
very low.
''Now, my problem is I can't sleep properly. Last night, I went to bed
at four, but was up at six. I have given up sleeping pills. I got fed up
feeling drowsy. I do get very tired.''
He went on: ''I live alone and in the night I often make myself some
tea, or watch old films. The other night, I heard two children clinking
glasses. I could have sworn they were in the next room but there was
no-one there . . .''
He spoke of how he felt somehow ashamed, not understanding what was
going wrong during spells of being reclusive over the past 20 years,
when he spent a lot of time building up a video library and listening to
music.
Last December, he felt much better than he had, watching his diet very
carefully, taking lots of vitamins.
''It's all a precarious balance. I've now put on too much weight and
would like to get it down but I'll probably feel worse.
''Dieting can be counter-productive,'' he said, adding that he thought
he had found one secret of living with an illness.
''It is very simple: acceptance. I believe in fate, leave it up to Him
but the vital thing, when fate has struck, is not to be sad. It's lack
of acceptance that makes people sad,'' the duke said.
''I might have ended up in the loony bin. Instead, I accept what has
happened and try each day not to overreach myself.''

HIGHLAND doctors and dentists are being asked to submit a vote of no
confidence against their chief executive St John Hattersley.
The professionals, employed by the financially troubled Highland
Communities NHS Trust, are the first in Scotland to undertake such a
ballot.
The more than 100 medics who run 14 small hospitals throughout the
Highlands are following the example of nurses and other staff in the
1600 workforce who have already voted. The result of that vote has not
been announced.
Dr Alastair Scott-Brown, consultant psychiatrist at Craig Dunain
Hospital in Inverness, said he believed it was the first time doctors in
Scotland had taken such action.
''There has been an early count and half of our colleagues have cast
their vote but I am not saying what the result is so far,'' Dr
Scott-Brown said. ''We want as complete a return as possible before
making an announcement and as we have a scattered community, it is
taking some time.''
One doctor, who declined to be named, said: ''This is a sad reflection
of our times that we have had to do something like this.''
A trust spokesman said last night the trust were very concerned and
would consider the matter when they were formally advised.
A spokesman for Highland Health Board said they were seriously
concerned by any indication of low morale.
In August, the trust discovered they faced a deficit of #1.8m and that
#1m of this had been due to errors in budget negotiations with Highland
Health Board.
In October, Mr Hattersley unveiled a programme of economies which
could save #1.3m in the current year and included the shedding of up to
45 jobs. Consideration would also be given to the closure of one of four
wards in Inverness's main geriatric hospital.
Mr Hattersley insisted that none of his proposals would prejudice
patient care.
Yesterday, Mr John Robertson, chairman of Highland Health Board,
announced: ''To ensure that the level and extent of patient services are
not compromised by a financial shortfall in Highlands Communities Trust,
the board has agreed to make available up to #500,000 to enable the
trust to meet its contract commitments.''
* A decision by the Scottish Office to place the employment contracts
of junior doctors with individual hospital trusts was greeted with
disappointment by the British Medical Association yesterday.
BMA Scottish Secretary, Dr Brian Potter, said non-teaching hospitals
might find it difficult to retain staff.
The decision, which applies to registrars and senior registrars -- and
the single grade of specialist registrar which will replace them -- was
announced by the Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.

From little ducks to big bucks: Tannoch Loch is booming, reports
Stewart McIntosh.
A SURGE of activity is making waves at one of the west of Scotland's
most exclusive residential areas. Surrounded by very expensive houses,
Tannoch Loch is Milngavie's Golden Pond. And something is rippling under
the surface.
''This is a very coveted area,'' says estate agent Gordon Adams of G &amp;
S Properties, ''where houses seldom come on the market. In all my 25
years as an estate agent in the area I can count on the fingers of one
hand the houses that have changed hands at Tannoch Loch. But in the last
six months there has been a flurry of buying and selling -- and all of
it for big bucks.''
Many of the recent deals have been purchases by people already living
in the area but who want a view of the loch, according to Adams. ''If
you can see the water, that's worth several thousand pounds on any
property.''
Recent deals include a house put on the market at offers over #235,000
-- but sold for #280,000. A modern bungalow was advertised at offers
over #140,000 but sold for #172,000.
The most dramatic uplift was the house which was advertised at
#200,000 but fetched #275,000 -- one of its key selling points being its
lawn which stretched down to a private jetty onto the loch.
''Crazy stuff!'' says Adams. ''Especially in this depressed market.
There is big money being paid up there.''
Many of the houses have large gardens backing on to the waterside.
Fishing rights on the small loch come with some of the properties.
''The people whose houses back on to the loch cherish their privacy.
Some of them take exception to anyone from outside the area strolling
round the loch -- they even object to people feeding 'their' ducks!''
says one local resident.
As a conservation area, Tannoch Loch has long been protected from
development. But the uncrowded atmosphere around the golden pond may be
facing its swansong. Within the last few months two nearby sites have
been given planning consent for residential development -- one of them
after a protracted planning battle which went all the way to the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
The site is in the grounds of a detached house at the corner of
Mugdock Road and Mosspark Road. The five-bedroom house is currently on
the market at offers over #195,000, while the development plot is being
sold at offers over #75,000 -- both via G &amp; S Properties.
''This planning consent has created an important precedent,'' says
Adams. ''Many of the houses in the area have large gardens -- some
residents must be asking themselves whether they might get consent for
another house in their grounds.''
The other site is a little further up Mugdock Road where architects
and developers Russell &amp; Bryce have consent for a seven-apartment house.
It could fetch up to #300,000 when complete. ''We have detailed consent
for a stylish house which has been designed to chime in with the area,''
says Ronnie Bryce of Russell &amp; Bryce.
''Our idea is to sell the plot and the design, then build the house
for the buyer. To be blunt about it, I've no doubts whatsoever that we
can get that kind of money in the Tannoch Loch area.''
He confirmed a quiet trend in the Bearsden and Milngavie area for
people with large gardens to seek consent for residential development.
''If you could get #100,000 tax free for a chunk of your garden, you
might consider seeking consent yourself,'' he said.
The development plot with its planning consent and house design are
being marketed by G &amp; S Properties.

WITH the first blasts of winter whistling around the eaves, cosiness
comes high on a buyer's list of priorities; which means small rooms. Or
does it? A property being marketed by estate agent Roy Slater offers an
unusual combination of big rooms and cosy corners.
Each of its two spacious public rooms comes with its own inglenook.
The seven-apartment property is within Monkton Hall, an imposing mansion
-- on Troon's Southwood Road -- which has retained many original
features.
The building's period feel starts right from the hallway, panelled to
three-quarters height. The large drawing room measures 28ft by 26ft and
is completely panelled in oak. From its pair of bay windows there are
views across the grounds and on to woodlands.
The separate dining room has its own bay window, beamed ceiling, and
large inglenook housing a large cast-iron basket for log-burning. And
the main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, two bay windows, and an
Adam-style fireplace.
The conversion comes with a private garden accessed from the kitchen.
There are also lawns and woodlands extending to around 10 acres -- owned
communally by the proprietors of Monkton Hall. Roy Slater's Ayr office
is seeking offers over #219,000 for the conversion.

BRITAIN is awash with leaking pipes, and the problem is not confined
to the pipelines owned by the water companies.
A major estate agent which offers its clients an emergency repair
service for domestic disasters calculates that 50% of all call-outs are
to fix leaking pipes. Some 25% of the calls are caused by faulty central
heating systems, while 12% are to replace missing slates and roof tiles.
When added together, all other calls received -- to repair blocked
drains, broken locks, leaking radiators, light failures, cracked
glazing, central heating pump failures, and cooker breakdowns -- come to
13%.
These findings are attendant to General Accident Property Services'
offer to pay the first year's premiums on free emergency cover provided
by Green Flag home Assistance, a form of cover which has been available
for the last five years.
Anyone who buys or sells via GA Property Services between now and
January 31 is eligible for the free cover, so long as they complete
their transaction before July 31, 1996.
The cover provides a free hotline which can be called as many times as
required during the year. Each free call-out comes with up to three
hours' labour and up to #100 of materials. The service is provided via a
network of 1000 tradesmen who have been vetted and whose work is
guaranteed by Green Flag.
It is claimed that the scheme covers more than four million people and
receives an average of 1000 calls per day. The GA package comes with six
months' free mortgage protection insurance. ''Imagine the nightmare
scenario,'' says Keith Burns, GA's marketing manager. ''You've just
moved into your dream home, something goes wrong, and in the midst of
your domestic disaster you can't find a tradesman to help.
''First-night emergencies are all too familiar. A staggering 75% of
new home-owners use their domestic emergency cover within three months
of moving in.''

IT was the fumes and fug of Glasgow that created some of the most
pleasant villages on the Clyde coast. Around 150 years ago places like
Rhu, which stands at the narrows on the Gareloch, were being developed
as fresh-air havens where Glasgow's wealthier merchants could escape
from the murky consequences of their investments in mines, forges, and
shipyards.
Few of us can afford the lifestyle which those princes of the
industrial revolution created for themselves and their families, but
many of their larger houses have now been broken up into smaller
conversions. Edinburgh estate agent Brodies is marketing such a
conversion within Laggary House, an Italianate grade B Listed mansion on
the Gareloch which stands in its own two acres of woodland gardens.
The house is believed to have been commissioned by a Glaswegian who
made his fortune in shipbuilding. With most of the shipbuiliding
industry gone from the Clyde, Laggary now overlooks the nearest
sea-going equivalent in our post-industrial times -- Rhu Marina.
The conversion has been created from the principal ground-floor rooms
of Laggary House. The property comprises: drawing room, dining room,
library, and three bedrooms. It has retained many of the original
features including timber panelling, fireplaces, and impressive plaster
ceilings and cornices.
The property comes with an Aga in the kitchen and gas-fired central
heating. ''With its spacious, richly fitted accommodation and beautiful
setting, the property offers the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of
living in a historic mansion with the price and maintenance costs kept
to a minimum,'' says Mark Atkinson of Brodies.
He is seeking offers over #145,000 for the ground-floor conversion.

GLASGOW'S west end is clearly an exciting place to live these days. At
least two companies are actively looking for properties in the area, and
they want them now.
''It's a very lively area,'' says Grahame Storrie of the Rented
Property Company, relatively new at six months old. ''And look at all
the people working in a hospital or university background. Many like to
be in a walk-to-work distance from their flat.
''It's really the whole ambience that is popular. You have all the
facilities people want. Our clients are looking for a place that's handy
for their business, and just jumping with atmosphere.''
Typically, he's talking about the 20- and 30-somethings; mainly
singles; into business; but not too swanky.
''The west end in general is what our clients are looking at,'' says
Grahame. ''It takes in areas like Broomhill, Dowanhill, Kelvinside,
Hyndland, Woodlands, Charing Cross, and Partick too -- there's been a
lot of renovation and a lot of money spent there.
''If you take the Merchant City, that's still popular. I feel there
have been a number of changes, and the old yuppy image has largely gone.
''Our typical tenant would be single, looking for a two- or
three-bedroom flat in a traditional stonebuilt property. Good, solid,
lots of quality -- that's what they want.
''We match the prospective tenant with a selected property. We would
do a normal vetting and offer a six-month short assured lease as a
minimum.
''It is essentially for the business community, I would say, and we
can deal on a finder's fee basis simply, or arrange management. It gives
an option.''
With rental on the agenda only for five weeks in their Byres Road
shop, those in Clyde Property have also been pleasantly surprised by
demand.
Director Deborah Rummens says: ''We include rental to meet pressure of
demand. It's as simple as that. Taking Anniesland to the city centre as
covering the west end, I can say rental demand is very strong indeed.
''Put it this way. I've had 98 inquiries for rentals, in the last
week. We already have more than three dozen properties, in just over a
month. They vary from penthouses and luxury flats to family houses, and
most of the inquiries are from professional people and the business
community.
''The two main age groups seem to be 25-35 and 55-65. Average rentals
are probably around #700, and that includes some at up to #2000 a month.
That would get you the last word in luxury, of course.''
The kind of places on offer from The Rented Property range from a
conversion to a country cottage. A traditional-style flat in Broomhill,
with one bedroom, lounge, dining kitchen and bathroom, giving panoramic
views of the surrounding area and ideal for local amenities, would come
in at around #450 a month.
From Clyde Property, a first-floor flat at the Waterfront, with views
along the river frontage, would have reception hallway, lounge, fitted
kitchen, two double bedrooms, dressing room, en-suite shower room and
bathroom. Plus garden grounds and parking areas. Rental: about #550 a
month.

EXCLUSIV E
Brussels
MEMBERSHIP of the European Union is costing the British only #16 a head
annually, according to new figures produced by the German finance ministry.
The news contradicts the arguments of Tory Eurosceptics who have long claimed
that Britain is paying far more than its share in annual subscriptions to the
community.
The figures, previously unpublished, were shown to The Herald yesterday by Mr
David Martin, Labour Euro-MP for Lothians, who said: ``Bearing in mind the
contribution the EU has made to peace in Europe over the past 40 years and the
vital part the single market plays in helping our economic prosperity, #16 a
head can only be regarded as excellent value for money.''
The figures cover only 1994 and do not take account of the three newest EU
members, Austria, Finland and Sweden. When the 1995 figures are published they
are expected to show the three newcomers as net contributors to the EU.
The Germans' figures confirm, as expected, that Germany is by far the biggest
contributor, spending the equivalent of #135 per head on the community, more
than eight times the per capita cost to the British. They are followed by the
Dutch who spend #96 per head.
Both the French and Italians spend more than twice that of the British. The
French pay almost #37 per head and the Italians #36. Even the Belgians pay more
than the British. EU membership costs them almost #25 a head.
This means that of all the net contributors to the EU budget, Britain's is the
smallest in per capita terms. The figures also indicate that Britain has become
poorer in relative terms in recent years because contributions to the EU are
calculated on economic performance.
Those who gain most are the Irish whose government is one of the biggest
recipients of European aid. The Irish receive help worth #393 per head.
The report suggests that Luxembourgers are even better subsidised, receiving
more than #700 a head, but this is regarded as a statistical freak. Luxembourg
is so tiny (population 370,000) that the figures appear to be meaningless.
Luxembourg is also the richest EU member state.
Behind the Irish come the Spanish, Portuguese and Greeks. Spaniards receive the
equivalent of #64 a head, the Portuguese #148, and the Greeks almost #300. The
Danes receive the equivalent of #30 per head.
These figures are based on the Ecu being worth 80p in 1994. At today's rate of
83p the British contribution would be only another 60p per head. They are based
on net contributions - the difference between the amount member states pay into
the EU and then recover in various forms of subsidy and aid.
Mr Martin, Labour's leading European strategist and a vice president of the
European Parliament, said: ``Firstly, contrary to popular myth, the EU consumes
a tiny proportion of our public expenditure and secondly the common
agricultural policy (CAP) still distorts the community's budget to Britain's
disadvantage. If we could get real reform of the CAP then in money terms we
would be getting more out than we put in.''
He added: ``However, the advantages of European Union membership cannot be
measured in financial terms alone. The peace and stability we have gained from
membership are simply incalculable.''

ONE of the world's most famous saxophonists, President Clinton, was treated to
a performance by a fellow sax player and an Irish musical legend in Belfast
last night.
Curtis Stigers and Van Morrison were staging a special show on the steps of
Belfast City Hall after the President switched on the city's Christmas lights.
Mr Clinton has seen Stigers play before - he was one of about 12 star saxophone
players who jammed at one of his inauguration parties in Washington in 1993.
Though an avowed Clinton supporter, Stigers may be secretly glad that the
President has reportedly left his saxophone at home.
``As much as I agree with his policies, he's not necessarily the best saxophone
player in the world,'' he said.
A native of Belfast, the often reclusive Van Morrison has steered well clear of
Northern Ireland's political controversies during his 30-year career.
Honoured for his outstanding contribution to British rock music at last year's
Brit Awards, Morrison first fronted 1960s rhythm and blues band Them.
Subsequently he married his American soul influences with Irish spirituality to
create a unique sound.
Stigers will be touring in mainland Britain next month.
It is three years since Stigers's smash first album, which sold 600,000 copies
in Britain alone and produced the single hits I Wonder Why and You're All That
Matters To Me.

A CIVIL servant who tried to smuggle two suitcases containing almost 20,000
cigarettes through Glasgow Airport has been fined #500.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that Nicola Haslam, 20, of Logie Drive, Larbert,
was stopped in the ``nothing to declare'' channel in April. The cigarettes,
which were confiscated, should have carried a total of #2400 payable in excise
duty and VAT.
Haslam, an operational accountant with the Child Support Agency, said she
bought the cigarettes at a cash and carry warehouse in the Canary Islands while
on holiday, for about #600.
She denied knowingly attempting to avoid duty by concealing them with intent to
defraud the Government, but was found guilty after trial.
Sheriff James Spy adjourned the case after he was told that Haslam might lose
her job.
When Haslam appeared for sentence yesterday, the court was told that her
security pass had been taken away and her employment could still be in jeopardy.
A defence solicitor urged the sheriff to give her client an absolute discharge,
adding: ``She has been told that she failed to maintain the conduct and
integrity expected of a civil servant, and been confined to duties with no
access to computers.
``Her employment is still up in the air.''
Sheriff Spy fined Haslam #500, payable at #10 a week.
