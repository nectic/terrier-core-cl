<HEADLINE>Pope approves juice for alcoholic priests</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
GRAPE juice is to be offered instead of Communion wine to Roman
Catholic priests battling against drink problems.
The Pope has ruled that unfermented red grape juice, available from
supermarkets, may be substituted.
Concern about the growing problem of drinking in seminaries lies
behind the move. In future, priests will be allowed to take the juice
when it is considered that even the smallest quantity of alcohol would
be harmful.
Father Edward Featherstone, chaplain to the Newcastle branch of the
Calix Society which offers spiritual development to members of
Alcoholics Anonymous, said he knew of ''a number'' of priests with
serious drink problems.
''There are several priests who are recovering alcoholics. As far as I
know, they drink the ordinary wine at Mass,'' he said.
Details of the new rules are set out in a Vatican letter, which also
bars Roman Catholics who are alcoholics from entering the priesthood.
It rules out the substitution of bread and wine, deemed to become the
body and blood of Jesus Christ during the celebration of the Eucharist.
Vatican officials had been considering whether countries could use local
substitutes such as saki and rice-bread instead.
The Vatican also ruled that gluten-free bread should not be used as a
Communion wafer -- a blow for people with coeliac disease. However,
low-gluten bread may be used.

WORLDWIDE
THE position of FIFA's secretary general, Sepp Blatter, accused of tax
evasion, is under threat.
Taxes in Switzerland are heavier for city dwellers than those living
in rural areas, and allegedly Blatter, who earns #450,000 annually,
claims he resides in a small apartment above a shoe shop in the village
of Appensell. However, investigators insist he lives in a mansion in
Zurich and owes #70,000 in unpaid taxes.
The scandal could not have embroiled Blatter at a more embarrassing
time, with FIFA and UEFA involved in a power struggle.
If he is found guilty, it will almost certainly lead to changes within
the FIFA hierarchy and lend ammunition to its adversaries in Europe who
are seeking a greater say in controlling the world game.
* TELEVISION'S increasing influence on football is causing particular
concern in Spain, where TV rights to their league will be re-negotiated
in two years' time.
Antenna 3, one of their biggest TV companies, is suspected of having
bought into 15 football clubs so that they will be guaranteed to win the
new television contract. Sporting Gijon, Hercules Alicante, Real Oviedo,
and Racing Santander are claimed to be among their more prominent
acquisitions.
Last week, Antenna 3 were also said to have bought over Division 2
side Real Majorca. Almost immediately five new players were added to the
staff to help their promotion prospects and provide another crucial vote
when the television contract is awarded.
* HARD as it may seem, a row over a haircut has divided Argentina.
Real Madrid's Fernando Redondo has refused to play for his country
because this would involve having his long tresses shorn.
Coach Daniel Passarella, who has insisted on a clean new image for his
team, flew to Madrid last week in a futile attempt to persude Redondo to
change his mind. When his decision became apparent, even Argentina's
president, Carlos Menem, sided with the coach and criticised the player.
Maradona then accused the coach of acting like a dictator, and captain
Oscar Ruggieri added: ''I cannot understand why the selection of a
player should depend on the length of his hair.''
* NIGERIAN police are under investigation after the death of one of
the country's most promising players. Igenewari George, whose older
brother Finidi is with Ajax, was shot dead in a bus when rioting broke
out after a youth match. Police claim the bullet may have come from a
home-made gun fired by a rioter.
Despite learning of the tragedy, Finidi still played for Ajax a few
hours later in their 1-0 win over Real Madrid in the Champions' League.
Coach Luis van Gaal said: ''To turn in such an outstanding performance
in these circumstances shows the character of the player.''

SUNDAY CRICKET
KENT yesterday ended their 17-year wait for a trophy by lifting the
AXA Equity and Law League title -- with a little help from the weather.
Facing county champions and NatWest Trophy winners Warwickshire,
Kent's triumph was confirmed when nearest rivals Worcestershire were
washed out against Glamorgan at New Road -- giving them the title
whatever the outcome of their match.
In the event, Dermot Reeve's side romped to victory with 10 balls
remaining to leave Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Kent level on 50pts
-- but Mark Benson's team took the #35,000 first prize on a better
run-rate.
Nigel Llong hit a spirited 51 to help Kent reach 166 after Reeve
grabbed four for 22 but Warwickshire had little trouble sprinting to
their victory total of 167 for five -- and clinching second place.
Worcestershire were forced to settle for third after rain ended their
innings at 145 for six with 2.5 overs remaining, but another storm ended
Glamorgan's reply at three without loss from 10 deliveries.
Kent captain Benson said: ''I can't put into words what this means to
me. We're bottom of the championship, and I'm sorry about that. But
we've also won a trophy, and at the start of the season I think we would
all have settled for that combination.
''When we lost the Benson and Hedges Cup final earlier this season we
were standing fifth in the championship. I think it was only natural
that the players have concentrated on the Sunday League and the
championship has slipped.
''We didn't play very well today, admittedly. But in recent weeks
we've had do-or-die matches against Lancashire, Worcestershire and Essex
and won all those.''

St Mirren 0, Dunfermline 2
SOMEONE should be selling lucky white heather outside East End Park,
and anywhere else that Dunfermline play. For a team who have set so many
records -- in the goal scoring department, in number of points won, in
runs of games without defeat -- still to be in the First Division must
go down as one of the great inigmas of the game.
On top of their record, they have missed out on promotion for the past
two seasons by only one point.
They're off and running again -- full points from five games, worthy
leaders, and looking good.
Yet Bert Paton and his management team already must be having
nightmares about what could happen in this, the most competitive First
Division in those three seasons.
And let it be noted that another club record has been shoved into
history with this comfortable victory against a disappointing St Mirren
side at Love Street on Saturday.
Dunfermline are now unbeaten in the league since January 11 this year
-- an amazing run of 20 games, passing the mark set way back in the
mid-eighties when, between August 24, 1985, and January 26, 1986, the
Fifers went 18 games in a row without losing.
Paton is one of those managers who rarely takes credit for success,
but is not slow to admit mistakes. Example: ''I read the riot act in the
last three games, but most of our players don't respond to that. They
respond to encouragement. We learned a lesson from that.''
Second example: ''I changed the tactics against Forfar in midweek, and
quite frankly, made a ...'' the remainder of the quote is omitted in
case any of our readers are of a nervous disposition or do not have a
dictionary of Anglo-Saxon phrases to hand.
As for the goals, Norrie McCathie, the so-called defender who lived up
to his solid reputation by helping Andy Tod to snuff out the Saints
strikers, particularly Barry Lavety, also showed that he could strike as
well.
He enjoys coming up for set pieces and he got on the end of an Allan
Moore cross to put Dunfermline ahead after 18 minutes.
Saints keeper Alan Combe must have had an earache from the sound of
his crossbar being smacked twice in quick succession by shots from Greg
Shaw and Paul Kinnaird after 24 minutes.
It was only a matter of time before Dunfermline subdued the lacklustre
Saints and that was in 56 minutes.
It was a tragedy for Paul McIntyre, one of Saints' top players
alongside Stephen Watson at the heart of a hard-pressed defence. Jackie
McNamara crossed from the right, McIntyre and keeper Combe did a
magnificent impersonation of ''After you, Claude'', and Stewart Petrie
nipped in to say thank you very much as he steered the ball into the
net.
Saints manager Jimmy Bone summed up his side's display thus: ''We were
beaten by a better team. It was a poor display by us. There's nothing I
can add to that.''

IT is normally a pin-sticking job but punters who did their homework
had little difficulty in finding the winner of the Ayr Gold Cup.
The Herald tipster, Robin Cook MP, Shadow Foreign Secretary, who
presented the trophy to the winning owner, was no exception.
He singled out Royal Figurine, 8-1, as pick of the handicap, and also
gave the four-year-old filly his vote as best turned out of the 29
runners.
From the first day of this sun-baked Scottish festival of Flat racing
when Portelet landed the Ladbroke Sprint the results had shown that high
numbers had the best chance.
This was confirmed an hour before the ''big one' when Keston Pond,
drawn 25 won the Ayr Silver Cup, and the first four home were all drawn
in the twenties.
The high draw was not the only pointer to Royal Figurine's
well-deserved success -- the fifth filly or mare to win in six years.
She had shown late-season form as a two-year-old, and was only beaten
a short head by Cheyenne Spirit in a fast run Listed race over six
furlongs at Newmarket last month.
Trainer Martin Fetherston-Godley, who has a small yard near Newbury,
was shrewd enough to get the money on at 33-1 the following day, and he
also backed his filly at 25's and 20's.
''I felt she had an outstanding chance after Newmarket. I think Hills
must have been asleep to give me 33's,'' he said, stating that his
confidence had dissolved last weekend when Royal Figurine worked poorly,
but by Wednesday she was back on song.
Wearing tartan trews to advertise his Scottish connection -- his
father runs commercial shooting on an estate Kirriemuir -- the
38-year-old trainer said that after having won over five furlong at
Chester last season and beating Brave Edge at Newbury in April, the
filly had improved ''out of all recognition.''
''Its been a wonderful year,'' said Fetherston-Godley, who won the
Magnet Cup at York with Naked Welcome.
Owner Craig Pearman was full of praise for winning jockey Darryll
Holland, who made the most of his high draw racing along the stand-side
rails, but delayed his challenge until well inside the final furlong.
Master of Passion, 25-1, was the early leader, and the winner of last
year's Silver Cup still had the call at the furlong pole.
Holland took ''a pull'' on Royal Figurine a furlong from home because
he did not want to hit the front too soon. When he made his move he was
taken on by No Extras, 16-1, and Patto, the 15-2 second favourite, but
just held on to get the judge's verdict by a neck.
''I was in the box-seat for most of the way,'' said Holland. ''I just
sat on the fence and waited. I owe it to Walter Swinburn who rode her
before. He said she had the confidence to win.''
Holland, who goes to ride in Hong Kong in three weeks, had a
magnificent Gold Cup day. Royal Figurine was the middle leg of a 100-1
treble, with Annus Mirabilis 8-11 and Torch Vert 11-2.
Branston Abby, the 7-1 favourite, finished down the field. Mark
Johnston's mare was drawn No.18 and also had 9st 12lbs, only two pounds
less than Roman Warrier who won it 20 years ago. The last favourite to
win was Vaigley Great in 1978.
Mary's Case, 12-1, took the last, giving Mark Jonston his 100th winner
of the season.
Jockey John Carroll, who took a bad fall from Shikari's Son in the big
race, will be away from race-riding for the next six to 10 days.
The rider, though bruised, admitted he had been very lucky to have got
away from the incident with nothing worse than cracked ribs.
''The hospital checked out my lungs and x-rayed my chest when I got
home,'' Carroll said. ''Fortunately, it revealed nothing more serious
than cracked ribs.''
Meanwhile, Scots-born jockey Iona Wands makes one of her rare visits
home today when she has three rides at Edinburgh for trainer Brian
Baugh.
Iona would appear to have her best chance on Boffy in the September
Holiday Nursery.
The Edinburgh Festival Handicap has attracted a large field in which
Lord Advocate must have a chance on bottom weight.

Edinburgh Academicals 28, Heriot's FP 10
IT has not been the best week for Heriot's. Having conceded a
plenitude of points against Watsonians last Wednesday, the Goldenacre
side again turned off the style in losing heavily to Edinburgh
Academicals at Raeburn Place on Saturday, when for the second successive
match the deserted kicking form of their New Zealand import Terry Rahui
was a factor in defeat.
A return to more prosperous days will depend to a large extent on the
speedy return of Heriot's current war casualties, the most notable of
which are Andy Macdonald and Cameron Glasgow.
Even Macdonald, however, would have found it hard to compete against
the Academicals duo of jumpers, Malcolm McVie and Scott Murray.
McVie, playing on the opposite side to his brother Tamas, was helped
by the accurate throwing of Paddy Haslett, the Academicals' hooker.
Academicals also were aided by a revitalised performance from Colin
Allan, the former Dundee High School FP flanker.
He not only scored a fine try from a break by Kevin Troup and support
from Martin Waite but crucially looked sharp in defence.
That will make it difficult now for Academicals to choose between him
and the impressive Rob Houle for the open side position, although
rotation within the squad remains an option.
Martin Waite also claimed a try and it was his quick pick up from the
base of the scrum that triggered Academicals' best score, made by the
support at speed of Ken Baillie and finished by Ulsterman George
McKinley. Brian Hay-Smith, controlling the game from stand-off,
converted two of his side's tries and kicked three first-half penalty
goals.
For Heriot's, whose handling was at times woeful, Gordon Lawrie
exploited a midfield defensive mix-up to score under the posts for Phil
Smith to convert, the full back also succeeding with an earlier penalty
goal after Rahui had twice failed.
Edinburgh Academicals -- K Baillie; G McKinley, M Duncan, C Murray, J
Millar; B Hay-Smith, K Troup; J Fayers, P Haslett, B Brown, M McVie, S
Murray, D McIvor, M Waite, C Allan. Replacements, R Houle for Allan (80
minutes).
Heriot's FP -- P Smith; H Gilmour, D Lewis, G Lawrie, D Officer; T
Rahui, F McMillan; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, P Young, C Humphries, T
McVie, J Robertson, G Dall. Replacements, G Owenson for Paul (68).
Referee -- I Ramage (Berwick).
SCORERS: Edinburgh Academicals -- Hay-Smith, 3p, 2c; McKinley, 1t;
Allan, 1t; Waite, 1t. Heriot's FP -- Smith, 1p, 1c; Lawrie, 1t.

THIRD DIVISION
THREE tries in the second half consolidated Biggar's win over
Musselburgh, which allows them to move above joint leaders Kirkcaldy on
points difference.
A try from Willie Steele and a Dennis Lavery penalty against a Fraser
Rowberry penalty put them 8-3 ahead at the interval.
Eighteen minutes into the second half, Lindsay Graham touched down
with Lavery converting. In the final quarter, Simon Read twice got over
with Lavery converting the second for a 27-3 victory.
A try by Neil Renton and two penalties from John Mitchell gave
Kirkcaldy an 11-6 interval lead against Preston Lodge. But Preston took
over and two penalties from Scott Gilliland eased his side into a one
point lead.
Then after 60 minutes, injuries forced two changes in the home pack
with Ian Rankin and Danny Herrington coming on for No.8 Mark Thomson and
Rab McCormack.
This proved the turning point. The Kirkcaldy backs again saw the ball
and tries followed in quick succession for John Lang, Renton, and
Mitchell who added a conversion in the 28-12 win.
Glasgow Accies are hot on the heels of the leaders thanks to a 67-16
home success over Corstorphine. Speedy right-winger Torquil Mathewson
scored five touchdowns.
The heart of the win was the control the Accies' pack exerted with
possession quickly distributed wide. Even the try scored by lock Steve
Begley came when he popped up in the inside centre berth. Others fell to
Brian Boundy (2), John Mason (2) and inciseful centre Mike Davis.
However, Accies must continue to ponder the penalty count against them
with three kicked by Grant Pollock who also converted the second-half
try by centre Stewart Pilkington.
Peebles had the territorial balance against Grangemouth and used it to
record a 16-8 win.
Andre Bell kicked three penalties and converted a try by Allan Jeffrey
to leave Grangemouth still looking for a point.

Stewart's Melville FP 5, Glasgow High Kelvinside 93
GHK captain Steve Hirini was refusing to get carried away despite
leading his side on a 14-try blitz of lacklustre Stewart's Melville at
Inverleith.
After three league defeats, the Glasgow side are gradually coming to
terms with a new approach, and Hirini remains cautious. ''It's only a
start. We'll have to get the guys back down to earth on Tuesday.
''We're trying to play a different type of game, keeping the ball off
the ground and out of contact. We are still trying to adapt -- it takes
time.''
Hirini was still delighted with the performance however. ''It was a
real confidence-booster and the way we played was very pleasing,
regardless of the result.''
Although Stewart's Melville provided less than stern opposition, and
ran out of ideas long before full-time, it was still an extremely
impressive performance from GHK. Victory was built on a solid forward
performance which provided a platform from which to unleash a back
division oozing pace, with Cammy Little a constant threat with his
lightning bursts and George Breckenridge proving a lethal finisher,
grabbing four tries.
Only a couple of thumping Murray Thomson tackles prevented an early
GHK score as the game started at break-neck pace, and it was Stewart's
Melville who took the lead after 11 minutes when Graeme Stirling broke
George Agnew's tackle.
Breckenridge's first try levelled the scores then Hirini slotted a
penalty to put his side in front after 29 minutes.
Even by that early stage the home forwards were lagging behind and
consistently being beaten to the breakdown, while the backs missed the
steadying influence of Dougie Wyllie and were further hit when Danny
Bull retired hurt shortly before half-time.
Hirini sliced through the home defence after 33 minutes, Little's
blindside dart set up Agnew after 37 then Gerry Hawkes added a fourth on
the stroke of half-time for a 27-5 lead.
GHK, now in total control, took just four minutes to extend their lead
when Cammy Little rounded off a flowing attacking move and, although
Alan Kittle and Graeme Burns never gave up for the Colleges, it was all
one-way traffic.
GHK ran in another nine tries in the second half at the home side
capitulated and the final two scored highlighted GHK commitment to
running rugby as prop Gordon McIlwham and hooker Chris Docherty popped
up in support of flowing moves to take the final pass.

Stirling; F Pollock, G Burns; R McNulty, J Conlin, A Kittle, B Gordon, B

WHAT a petty little man James Traynor appears to be. He has been
sniping away at Craig Brown for over a year now. He gives the impression
that any success which the Scottish team has, while being managed by
Craig Brown, is a personal attack on his own judgment. I suppose he has
to justify all the snide remarks which he has been making on the last
two managers of the Scottish team.
His attack on Mr Brown in Monday's Herald is completely unfair and the
innuendos border on the paranoid. He must dislike Craig Brown an awful
lot; he has accused him of being a liar, inferring that neither Mr Stein
nor Mr Ferguson made any approach to Mr Brown regarding his assisting
them. Well! I am sure that Mr Ferguson can confirm or deny this
statement.
The only criticism which Mr Traynor directs against Mr Brown which is
relative to the way he is doing his job is that he has not chosen
Richard Gough in central defence.
I think Craig Brown is absolutely right in leaving out Richard Gough.
I think Gough is disruptive and is not a good team man. He is certainly
not better than any of the present central defenders in the Scottish
team.
Gough reminds me of Alan Hansen (another ''paper hero'') in that, once
the ball is taken past him, he cannot recover. Gough has to thank
players like John Brown for covering up his vulnerability which has been
obvious since he moved from right back to central defence.
I have been watching Scottish football for more than 50 years and I
have seen more than half the players who have ever played for Scotland.
In my opinon, the players who are available for selection just now are
the poorest I have seen. It is not their fault; they do their best, but
there are no Dalglishes, McGrains, Evans, Waddells, Baxters, Laws etc
etc, about just now.
I think Andy Roxburgh and Craig Brown have done a remarkably good job
of welding together teams of triers who have done much better than any
of us has a right to expect.
When you consider a) that Craig Brown has had so few obvious star
players to select and b) that nearly every selection has had numerous
call-offs and c) that some of the ''bigheads'' who play in the
fashionable teams decide when and if they will play for Scotland, then
-- despite James Traynor -- Craig Brown has done a great job.
I wish Mr Brown and the Scottish team all the best. I should like to
end with a little advice for Mr Brown. I am sure he would be much more
popular with sports writers if he were a little less grammatically
correct. A few more ''I dones'' and ''We have wents'' would make some of
them feel more at ease.

I HAVE rarely read a more vindictive personal attack by a sports
writer than that by James Traynor on the subject of Craig Brown.
James Traynor's problem is that for the past year he has been
predicting the exit of the Scottish team and the downfall of Craig Brown
and he has been continually proved wrong, both by the team and the
manager. Traynor's boring and repetitious articles have contributed
little to the football discussion which we all enjoy.
The manager has put together a winning record with a workmanlike squad
with no support whatever from the likes of James Traynor.

IN Wednesday's issue of The Herald in an article by John Beattie,
discussing the recent decision by the SRU on professionalism with David
Murray, it was stated by Mr Murray when posing a question: ''What was
the gate at the last Celtic home gate when they won the championship
nine times in a row?'' The answer was 8000.
I think that some clarification is needed. Celtic had already won the
league some weeks before this match with Morton. It was played in
midweek (not a nice evening, as I recall), so it was not a very good
example to be used by Mr Murray.
Mr Murray is a proven businessman and I do not wish to infer any
criticism whatsoever of his ability. I do feel, however, the example he
chose to illustrate his view was not altogether correct.
I can assure you had the match that night against Morton been for the
decision of the League Championship, you would have got a very much
larger crowd, more in line with the attendance at Celtic Park some few
years earlier when, on the last match Celtic had to win to collect the
championship, also against Morton and the attendance was 51,000.
If you have any views on my interpretation of Mr Murray's statement, I
would be most happy to hear it.

THE jury may still be out as to whether Elvis is alive or not, but
there is no doubting that Mickey Mouse is alive and well. I know this
because yesterday I attended a match he apparently organised for the SFA
-- Scotland Under-21 v Finland Under-21.
As this was Mickey's first shot at such a venture he introduced a few
gimmicks all apparently acceptable to the SFA. Here is a random example.
Create delay at the car parks through inadequate stewarding. Open only
one half of the ground to the fans. Announce the Scottish team well
before kick-off when most fans were still outside the stadium and fail
to repeat it thereafter. Sell programmes, effectively for the junior
game that night, in which the Under-21 squad listed therein omitted
player numbers, to prevent identification. Orchestrate chaos at the
turnstiles to cause inordinate delay and steady streams of latecomers.
Sadly, all his gimmicks worked and caused endless frustration and
annoyance. The SFA apparently reckon that for a first shot it wasn't a
bad effort although they suspect Mickey leant too heavily on Goofy for
advice.
Certainly, with Mickey at the helm, I shall not be returning to
support such fixtures and I'm sure many others will feel the same.

ONCE again, the narrow margin that exists between success and failure
in football is apparent by the shock removal of Simon Stainrod as team
manager of Ayr United. If he is genuinely away now, let us wish him all
the best and let us approach the finding of his replacement with due
speed and diligence.
If any Glasgow team manager fancies a move south, recent Ayr teams
have not been operating without a certain amount of success as
demonstrated by the 1-1 draw at Dundee at the tail end of last season
and having the ability to contain the expensive Celtic for the first 30
minutes of the recent cup tie.
In my opinion, if not already implemented, the first step is to recall
Frank Rolling from his loan to Leicester to form the backbone of any
future team and then to hold a meeting of all supporters to ascertain
their precise wishes for the replacement manager (and when the exact
amount of finance available can be reported) -- whether a former or
current player (like Malcolm Shotton), a more famous name (like Steve
Nicol), an established managerial type (like Tommy McLean) or even Don
Mackay (ex-Dundee, Coventry, Fulham).
When some or all of these points have been attended to, the success of
Ayr United is something the fans can genuinely look forward to.

ON behalf of other women who are season-ticket-holders and regularly
attend fixtures at Ibrox, I feel obliged to respond to a comment
reputedly made by David Murray to your reporter, about his intention to
encourage women and children to come to football.
To climb the stairs to the Club Deck is exhausting, to queue for the
whole of half-time to make use of the too-few toilet facilities is
frustrating, and to listen to repetitive foul language is offensive.
Perhaps if a woman was appointed to the board, some of the issues
could be addressed effectively, and then women would feel valued
supporters and not a disadvantaged minority as at present.

SAM Torrance became a hero the instant he holed the putt to win the
Ryder Cup at The Belfry in 1985. His gritty determination and his tears
of joy took him straight to the hearts of golfers and non-golfers alike.
Today he flies out by Concorde with this year's team in a bid to wrest
the trophy from the grasp of a supremely confident, some might say
overly confident, US team.
After all, the American dream came severely unstuck only last week
when their amateurs were soundly beaten by a UK and Ireland Walker Cup
performance of sheer class which highlighted the importance of a good
team spirit at Royal Porthcawl.
It's hard to make any comparison but at least their victory is a spur
for a European team that has been written off by so many. Even the
bookmakers have the Americans at 4-9 with their opponents at 2-1. Their
faith patently lies across the water.
Battle will be waged at Oak Hill, in Rochester, New York, a course
which is old by American standards, and was designed by Scotsman, Donald
Ross. The battleground has been prepared especially for the home forces
with seriously narrow fairways and greens almost as fast as the plane
taking the Europeans into battle.
And cup fever has been rising in America where attitudes have changed
following the close matches of the last decade. Tickets for the match
were sold out within 24 hours.
But while 25,000 spectators each day will be strolling the fairways to
see the drama unfold, in Britain the audiences will be much smaller than
in previous years. The trend for satellite television to swallow up the
leading sports events has seen to that.
Torrance, 42, will take with him the knowledge that he is top of the
Volvo Order of Merit after his close victory yesterday in the British
Masters. Afterwards he was asked what was next for him. ''To beat the
Americans,'' he said to cheers from the crowd.
His success was, as ever, with good grace, a trait which would be
welcome in his fellow Scottish competitor at Oak Hill, Colin
Montgomerie.
On Saturday Monty had been challenging for the lead in the tournament
when he put his ball in the lake at the eighteenth. Noticeably fuming,
he blamed the shot on a slip as he went to hit the ball.
''It had to be something, didn't it?'' Torrance said later.
Montgomerie is an easy man to dislike and he has never instilled the
same warmth as fellow Scots Torrance and Sandy Lyle, who, as ever,
teased his fans with an excellent opening round at Collingtree Park only
to falter as the tournament went on.
Lyle appears to have some kind of death wish, but his laid-back,
almost horizontal attitude, is endearing and his big boy lost look means
his supporters are constantly hoping for a resurgence of the form that
took him to many notable successes before he moved to a golfing desert.
Mongomerie, however, has never been popular. He never shows the
emotion or passion of Torrance, rather he shows his disgust or downright
sulkiness most of the time. They may both come from seaside towns, but
there the similarity appears to end.
Torrance is perceived as a man who plays golf for a living but would
really rather be at home with his family.
Montgomerie, on the other hand, is seen to be somewhat obsessive, and
certainly while many others on the tour play for three weeks and then
take one or two off, he is a restless soul who plays constantly. The
Ryder Cup will be his tenth tournament in 11 weeks. It may be that the
mark of a true champion is a single minded will to win, regardless, but
it does little to make one a folk hero.
Certainly, Seve Ballesteros has nothing but admiration for Monty, who,
he says, is the best player in the world at the moment. Given a choice,
Montgomerie would be his Ryder Cup partner following the withdrawal of
Olazabal.
And in some ways the unsmiling Scotsman may have been harshly treated.
His play is often overlooked because of tales of rudeness and arrogance.
In fact, in playing terms at least, he may well be the star of the Ryder
Cup team.
''There's nothing that can prepare you for it. The only preparation is
actually experiencing it,'' he has said. And although everyone remembers
Torrance's Ryder Cup golden moment, few will recount Montgomerie's half
with Mark Calcavecchia at Kiawah Island after being four down with four
to play.
Two crucial questions remain. Can we win the Ryder Cup on hostile
territory? Unlikely most would say. And will Colin Montgomerie smile?
Probably even less likely.

SCOTTISH supporters, winners of a special trophy awarded by UEFA after
the last European Championship finals in Sweden, have suddenly come
under fire from the organisers of next summer's football extravaganza
across the Border.
One of the officials of Euro '96, one Adrian Titchcombe -- well, it
would be an Adrian, would it not -- has taken it upon himself to slam
the drinking habits of the Tartan Army.
In an interview he says: ''We know that the Scots like a drink when
they go to football games. That brings with it the problem of certain
people becoming obnoxious and unpleasant.
''If you are taking your kids to the game and someone staggers up to
you and throws up all over the place, it is not nice and a little
threatening.''
Most of us would agree that such an incident would be far from nice --
but threatening? Not nearly as threatening as Nazi salutes. Not as
remotely threatening as swastikas being waved in the faces of people in
Dublin who did take their kids to a game earlier this year.
Neo Fascists who go to matches looking for trouble are threatening.
They threaten the very existence of the game and they will target the
European Championships just as they have trid to disrupt other matches.
If Mr Titchcombe wants to see the face of a frightened child then he
should look back the files and see a young boy who went to watch England
in Dublin in a friendly international.
That youngster and his father found themselves taking refuge on the
field while the Fascist mobs took over the stands on their wrecking
mission.
They came from England, these hooligans, and they are fellow
countrymen of Adrian Titchcombe who is worrying about the number of
Scots who may drink too much next summer.
The English will cause many more problems than the Scots. There is
nothing more certain that that. They will do so because there are groups
who are politically motivated who deliberately foment trouble at
grounds.
That is where Mr Titchcombe should be directing his gaze.
If he does want to send a searching look north then he should examine
the way the Scottish Football Association have handled the ever-present
threat of football hooliganism.
For example, decisions have already been taken at Park Gardens to
oversee the sale of match tickets when Scotland finally clinch
qualification.
Tickets will only be sold to members of the official SFA Travel Club.
At the moment that body numbers something close to 4500 fans.
Others, though, will join in order to watch the team take part in the
finals.
The chief executive of the SFA, Jim Farry, stresses: ''We have
discovered in the past that ticket sales for matches abroad must be
vetted very closely.
''That has been done over the years and it has resulted in
trouble-free finals at several World Cups as well as in Sweden at the
last European finals.
''We will follow these same ground rules. Tickets will be sold to
Travel Club members only and we shall try to make sure that we have
control over the sales of tickets to Scottish supporters in whatever
matches we might be involved in down south.
''We are not trying to jump the gun as regards qualification because
we know things are not finalised yet . . . but we did have to start to
make contingency plans.
''Over the years we have seen the supporters build a very good
reputation for themselves and we want that to continue in England. We
see no reason why that should not be the case if we follow the
guidelines which have been so successful in the past.''
There are suggestions that Scotland will get more than the promised
7000 tickets from the organisers, but that will not be known until the
draw has been made for the finals in Birmingham in December.
Clearly a change in allocation would depend on which other cuntries
are drawn in the same group as Scotland.
If there are teams from Eastern Europe who would, very obviously, not
be able to accept their full allocation, then a further number of
tickets would come to the other nations involved.
However, no matter how many Scots make the trek south in the summer,
they will never cause the mayhem that the National Front and their
allies have brought about as they followed England.
If there is threatening behaviour around it will come from the same
source as always, from the people who have terrorised Europe with their
swastika-daubed Union Jacks and their Nazi salutes.
If the good Adrian Titchcombe wants to worry over potential trouble at
the finals he should look closer to home.
And if he needs reminding he can look at the picture of the young
Irish schoolboy and his father during the Dublin riot.
Then he can wonder when it was that English supporters were last
rewarded for exemplary behaviour and good sportsmanship.
If ever.

FOURTH DIVISION
BRIAN Whittle, Scotland's former athletics' star, will have good
reason to remember his rugby debut for Kilmarnock at Bellsland on
Saturday.
Whittle came on as a replacement with 25 minutes left of the game
against Wigtownshire -- and scored a hat trick of tries.
He was one of two Kilmarnock players to score three tries in the 91-6
hammering of a much under-strength Wigtownshire. The other was Kevin
Pattie.
In a game beset by injuries, five replacements came on and the home
side finished with four wingers in the three-quarter line.
Ayr went down in injury time at Haddington in one of the most exciting
matches of the day. A try in the first minute from Peter Manning gave
them a dream start, but by half-time the locals were ahead.
In the closing stages, George McMillan took his penalty count to five
to give Ayr a 22-21 lead. They held this until Haddington's scrum half
George Cringan darted over for his second try which helped his team home
by 26-22.
A 25-19 win by Glasgow Southern at Langholm allowed them to take over
second spot from the Borderers with their try scoring hero No.8 John
Clinkenbeard.
Southern opened with a James Dunlop penalty and followed with two of
Clinkenbeard's touchdowns plus one from centre Andy Richardson which he
converted to build up a 20-9 interval lead.
However, Gary Brannan added his conversion of Craig Cotril's try to
earlier penalties and brought Langholm back into it at 20-16 with 13
minutes left. But Southern hung on in an exciting finish with
Clinkenbeard's try off-setting a fourth Brannan penalty.
Only points difference separates Southern from Gordonians who
dismissed Edinburgh Wanderers 35-3 for their first home win. Sean
McPherson and Duncan Pickup scored in the opening period and, in the
second half, Mark Estachy twice weaved his way through for exciting
scores. Bruce Doney kicked three conversions and three penalties.

POOR Mr Referee. At the Hawick v Boroughmuir match on Saturday it was
a stop start affair as penalty after penalty was awarded for the same
old offences.
If one person was penalised for handling the ball on the ground, then
the whole lot were at it for most of the game, which meant that there
was very little rugby, and a great deal of hanging around for kicks at
goal to be taken. And I hate kicks at goal.
All of which had the Hawick crowd baying for the man's blood.
Which wasn't at all fair because all he was doing was applying the
laws, and in applying the laws he had to stop the game.
I've always been fairly jealous of football, because, despite my inner
thought telling me that football is fundamentally a namby-pamby game
played by lazy sportsmen, even I can see that one of the beauties of
football is that the game is always moving.
Twenty two children on a full size pitch, and I watch my son on
Saturdays, can still provide something that is constantly changing and a
picture of activity.
At times, you can't say the same for rugby.
So whose fault is it? Well, when I played I used to think that the
referees should take a sympathetic view of proceedings and try to
produce a spectacle by ignoring some of the laws and letting the players
get on with it.
But that's a load of baloney.
What should happen now is that the referees should be told to apply
the laws to the letter -- especially at the ruck, where every team has a
few members adept at stopping play -- and ruin a few matches.
Ruin international matches if necessary until the crowd calls for
change and the players get the message.
It was Peter Wright who said on Sportscene Rugby Special on Sunday
that he wondered what had happened to the persistent infringement rule.
Referees have at their disposal a powerful piece of legislation that
says that if they spot someone transgressing the laws persistently then
they can be sent off.
As I rack my brains I can't think of one instance where I've seen a
player sent off in that way. On Saturday there should have been a whole
load of players sent off for persistent obstruction of the ball on the
ground.
Allan Hosie, the former international referee, it was who coined the
phrase that ''killers of the ball are murderers of the game'' and I like
that phrase. It sums the whole thing up.
There are rugby players around, who now want to be paid for playing
this game, who are quite happy to break the laws and help a game
degenerate into a kicking duel between stand offs. It is a tragedy.
I would go further than merely letting the referees get as strict as
they can be at the ruck. I would state in the rules that breaking a law
twice was persistent infringement.
So, if anybody was caught falling on the wrong side of the ball twice,
or handling the ball in a ruck twice, or barging in a lineout twice, or
-- and this is the great unseen in rugby as practised beautiful by
Boroughmuir on Saturday -- and that is standing offside as a backline at
a ruck twice, then I would call that persistent. And then I'd allow the
referees to send the offenders off.
Can you imagine the bleats of complaint from the players? Wonderful!
Get the offenders off the pitch.
You see, I still dream in my heart that rugby can be the most
beautiful of games, not only a fantastic game to play in but a wonderful
game to watch.
But rugby is infamously difficult to referee because it has so many
facets and because it has so many laws, and it can only be a beautiful
game if what we as spectators are presented with is something that
flashes past us in a blur of excitement and stunning activity, and not a
stream of penalty kicks as some of the lads break the rules.
The laws of rugby are complicated, and probably changed in smoke
filled gin soaked rooms by people who draw endless diagrams and
hypothesise until it's time to go to bed in whatever Hilton they happen
to occupy in whatever country they happen to have planned to have a
jolly in.
But, and here's where I may differ from a few, you could argue that
the only reason the laws look daft is that the players break them so
often when the lawmakers might think that players don't set out to break
the laws.
But they do. And if they do, more than once in a game, then they
should pay the consequences. They should be sent off.
More power to the refs.
* New Zealand will allow their players to demonstrate their opposition
to French nuclear testing in the Pacific on next month's tour of France.
NZRFU chief executive officer George Verry said yesterday that his
organisation ''will not stifle'' any members of the All Blacks squad
with strong anti-nuclear views. The NZRFU was made aware through All
Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick that many players shared the view of
flanker Josh Kronfeld, who has been banned from wearing a peace symbol
on his protective headgear, Verry said.
''As are the vast majority of New Zealanders, many of our All Blacks
have concerns about the tests,'' he said. ''Before the tour, we will be
discussing with them and the team management appropriate means by which
those views can be peacefully and responsibly expressed in France.''
But Verry emphasised there would be nothing extreme, saying the NZRFU
was strictly a non-political organisation and it was important for that
position to be maintained.

Watsonians 16, Melrose 41
SEVEN days may be a long time in politics but in rugby it would appear
that something short of just 72 hours is about the optimum period
required to conjure an almost remarkable about-turn in fortune.
For half an hour or so against Heriot's FP on Wednesday night,
Watsonians played some of the best club rugby seen in these parts for
many a long day.
By Saturday that purple patch was but a distant and fading memory as
Melrose provided an object lesson in control and tactical acumen.
Craig Chalmers was immense both in his domination of the game and in
the directness of his personal contribution. Likewise, Bryan Redpath
regained much of the sharpness which, by all accounts, his game had been
lacking since the start of the premiership.
But it was in the pack in general, and the back-row in particular,
that Melrose caused the rain to fall on Watsonians' parade.
Scott Aitken augmented back-row duties with a towering performance in
the lineout and the Borderers' two Southern Hemisphere recruits -- Kiwi
Nick Broughton and Western Samoan Isaac Fea'unati -- wrought havoc among
a Myreside eight which had been so impressive on Wednesday night.
Broughton, a 22-year-old PE student from Otago, is qualified for
Scotland through a Shetland grandmother, while it would come as no
surprise, albeit on the strength of just a single sighting, if Fea'unati
figured on Western Samoa's forthcoming tour of Scotland and England.
A Melrose official confided later, we think in jest, that the
possibility had never occurred to them at the Greenyards and that they
would now have to study his contract very carefully indeed.
Saturday's defeat was doubly painful for Watsonians, coming as it did
just as the ink was drying on John Connor's #50,000 cheque, but captain
Fergus Henderson did not seek to make the distraction of all the
off-field shenanigans a scapegoat for his side's dismal performance.
''The players have not been bothering about all this Connor hoo-hah at
all. The game came at the end of a hard week. Melrose rose to the
occasion and we flopped badly. Melrose had the heart and wanted the win.
We just turned up and weren't focused at all. We can't complain,'' he
said.
Melrose coach Rob Moffat said later that Broughton, in particular, was
a very good rugby player indeed and one from which his side could learn
much. He added, though, that it was much too soon to determine just how
good. ''Let's wait until they have played 10 games before we make any
conclusions,'' he said.
Peter Gallagher, the 'Sonians coach, who on Wednesday night said his
side had played 55 minutes of dross and 25 minutes of vintage rugby, did
not have to make any qualification about the side's performance on
Saturday. ''We were dire and diabolical. Melrose have had a hard week as
well but they took us apart up front, in all aspect of forward play, and
we never recovered.''
Particularly in the first half, Melrose played some cracking rugby
despite the fact that Watsonians opened the scoring with a Duncan Hodge
penalty goal. Rowen Shepherd rounded off a sparkling passage of handling
with a try after five minutes and it was evident, even thus early, that
Melrose were on top of their form.
Broughton, who had supplied the scoring pass for Shepherd's try,
capitalised on a searing break by Redpath to get one of his own seven
minutes later and Chalmers converted. It was Broughton again who broke
away before Jimmy Turnbull sped in for a try, again converted by
Chalmers, and only two further Hodge penalty goals kept Watsonians in
the race. Chalmers kicked a penalty goal after 39 minutes and Melrose
were 9-22 to the good at the turn.
A Robbie Brown try, converted by Chalmers, and a penalty goal from the
fly-half threatened to put Melrose out of sight but Watsonians bounced
back, after a fashion, with a try by Jamie Weston, converted by Hodge.
Thereafter, Watsonians never looked like salvaging anything from a
game played in superbly balmy conditions and before a healthy
4000-strong crowd, a drop-goal and two further penalty goals from the
peerless Chalmers served merely to aggravate Watsonians' agony.

I WAS quite astonished and deeply disappointed with both the nature
and tone of James Traynor's vitriolic and venomous diatribe against
Craig Brown.
What was Craig Brown's diabolic crime? Well, in James Traynor's Book
of Human Perfection, Mr Brown was inherently guilty of rather selfishly
extolling his own virtues.
Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong, and no crime involved, in
extolling one's own virtues particularly when, as in Mr Brown's case, it
is done with a fair modicum of humility. Nothing wrong with that at all.
Further, Craig Brown has just led the Scotland football team to the
European Championships for only the second time in our history and, in
the process, the football team under his command has registered six
victories, two drawn games, and one solitary defeat. If that's not
success then what the hell is? By any standards Craig Brown is a
successful team manager.
That begs the question as to what on earth James Traynor's reaction to
Craig Brown would have been had the Scotland football team failed to
qualify. I very much doubt that Mr Traynor could have topped the level
of vitriol and venom spat in Mr Brown's direction in his article.
In truth, I would remind James Traynor that he is most fortunate
indeed to write for a quality newspaper like The Herald. This
newspaper's readership rightly expect objectivity, balance, and fairness
to predominate at all times. What we, the readership, will never accept
is a sudden and dramatic lowering of the standards we have become
accustomed to.
No doubt Mr Traynor's article would have fitted comfortably into any
one of the myriad of football fanzines that exist in Scotland. That's
about its level.
C'mon, James, we know you can do so much better and that is the
primary reason for my astonishment and deep disappointment. Give credit
where credit's due and dispense forthwith with the cheap and nasty
stuff.

Nottingham Forest 3, Everton 2
MANAGER Joe Royle roasted his Everton team for their defending after
having watched a horrendous opening half-hour where they conceded two
goals in the Premiership defeat at Nottingham Forest.
''We were dreamy, dopey, and undisciplined,'' said Royle. ''We looked
tired and were standing around waiting for other people to do something.
We were sitting back and watching. It was awful -- the worst half-hour
we have had since I came to the club.''
Royle refused to blame the club's midweek European excursion to
Iceland for the hangover, even though his squad did not arrive back in
England until 4am on Friday.
''Maybe some minds were still on the plane. But we can't use that as
an excuse. Forest were in Europe too,'' he said.
''We want to be in Europe, anyway. But maybe I will have to make more
changes next time. At times I couldn't believe what I was watching.
''We were strong and aggressive last season but we have gone a little
bit soft in certain areas.''
Home manager Frank Clark attributed his team's improved performance to
a summit conference with his players after the midweek Malmo defeat. ''I
told the players I thought we were poor against Malmo and they accepted
that,'' he said.
''They responded today. They wanted to restore their pride. It was a
better performance all round.''
''The first 30 minutes was probably the best we have played this
season, but I was quite relieved to hear the final whistle.''

West Bromwich 1, Birmingham 0
ALAN Hunt kept Alan Buckley's West Brom on the heels of of the first
division promotion pacesetters with a superb strike to win the Hawthorns
derby over Birmingham.
Hunt sent Birmingham crashing to their third defeat in four away games
with his winner on the half hour mark by taking advantage of a mistake
by Liam Daish to fire past Ian Bennett.
The Birmingham keeper made a string of saves to deny Kevin Donovan and
Hunt as West Brom moved up to third in the table. Donovan was also
unlucky with an angled drive which flew into the side netting while
Bennett made a magnificent save to deny Hunt.
Birmingham's best chance came early in the game when Mark Ward created
a scoring opportunity for Ricky Otto, who blasted his shot high and
wide.

MARIE-LAURE de Lorenzi swept to an emphatic second triumph of the year
yesterday, posting a closing round of 68 to win the Dutch Open at
Nijmegen.
With an 18-under-par 201, which equalled the three-week old Tour
record set by Caroline Hall in Denmark, the Barcelona-based French
golfer won by nine strokes from Lancashire's Lora Fairclough.
Morag Wright was the leading Scottish professional. She carded a
final-round 72 to finish at five-under on 214 and share thirteenth
place, her best finish as a professional.
Afterwards, di Lorenzi said: ''I am playing better now than when I won
seven tournaments in 1988. The difference now is that the standard of
golf on the Tour is so much higher and it is more difficult to win.''
The French player had shared the first-round lead with Scotland's
Gillian Stewart on 67, but she separated herself from the field with a
course-record 66 in the third round on Saturday. It gave de Lorenzi a
seven-stroke lead going into the final round.
She started yesterday's round with a birdie, collected another at the
long sixth, then holed a recovery from a bunker for yet another birdie
at the eighth. She then birdied three out of the first five holes on the
back nine. Her only blemish was taking three putts for a bogey on the
fifteenth.
''I have played well all year, but everything slotted into place this
week,'' said de Lorenzi who has now had nine top-10 finishes in 11
tournaments this year.
It has been a fine tournament for Scotland's Wright, who failed to
earn her card at the qualifying school last March.
Throughout the three rounds, Wright, a former Scottish amateur
international, had only two bogeys. One of these came at the short
seventh hole yesterday. By then, she had birdied the fifth and collected
another birdie at the long 11th in her impressive 72.

THREE years in the international wilderness ended yesterday for Liz
McColgan when she won the Great North Run on Tyneside, and with it the
British half marathon title.
The Dundee woman, once justifiably billed as the world's best female
endurance runner, but then stricken by injury, was more recently -- not
for the first time -- labelled a has-been. But the manner of yesterday's
victory, and the quality of her victims, loudly herald the third coming
of Scotland's most durable athlete.
''At next year's Atlanta Olympics, I will be making my championship
debut in the marathon,'' said McColgan, confirming that the track career
which brought two Commonwealth and one world 10,000m title is over.
The decision was reached after consultation with new coach, Grete
Waitz, McColgan's haemorrhaging confidence having received a substantial
transfusion from this BUPA event.
''I need races to build confidence,'' confessed the Dundee Hawkhill
woman. ''The next step will be the Tokyo marathon in November. Before
that I'll run 10,000 metres races in Edinburgh, Portsmouth, and
Coventry. I believe 100% in Grete and what she is doing with me.''
The wide smiles, as Norwegian marathon guru Waitz embraced McColgan
after the finish, was eloquent testimony to their delight.
Waitz, inaugural world marathon champion, five times world
cross-country champion, nine times New York marathon champion, and six
times a world record-breaker, coaches only a handful of athletes in her
homeland.
''I wanted my role kept secret until we saw if our partnership would
work,'' Waitz told me.
''But I believe Liz can make far more impact in the marathon than at
10,000m -- and she has already been world champion at 10k.
''As a sub 15-minute 5000m runner, and a 4-01 1500m runner, she has
the track speed to win marathons. The days of people going out from the
gun and winning are history. Liz has to learn to run contained, stay in
the group, then sprint.
''Liz was making the same mistakes as me -- working too hard. We have
cut back her mileage. She needs to know when to rest, when to do easy
sessions, to get the benefit of the harder work -- that is the new
discipline I hope to bring.''
Racing into a strength-sapping headwind, the 31-year-old McColgan
clocked 71min 42secs and a more hard-fought success than her 23-second
winning margin suggests.
Second was Fatuma Roba, whom Ethiopian compatriot, Olympic 10,000m
champion Derartu Tulu, tips as her own successor. Portugal's European
and World marathon champion, Manuela Machado, was third, in 73-22.
England's Marian Sutton, the early pace-maker, was ditched shortly
before six miles (32-48), setting up a brutal battle over the remainder
of the undulating route from Newcastle to South Shields.
Immediately after nine miles (49-16) McColgan increased the tempo,
with a 5-17 mile -- too much for Machado -- but to the Scot's surprise,
the 22-year-old Roba stuck resolutely.
McColgan, typically, intensified the pace as Roba tucked in, out of
the wind. Thrice the Ethiopian went past, but McColgan countered
immediately, imposing her will by going back in front.
''I felt very much in control, but psychologically, I could not afford
to let her get even a few yards,'' said McColgan. ''But I was supposed
to sit in for the whole race, then sprint when I saw Grete, who was
standing 300m from the finish.''
But on the last uphill, with a mile and a quarter remaining, McColgan
snatched a look at her rival, and detected strain.
Driving hard up the slope, she opened a gap. Roba closed again, but
McColgan's racing antennae sensed she was weakening, and she strode out,
finally breaking clear with just 1200 metres left. By the time she saw
Waitz, the sprint was academic. All of the 23-second winning margin was
opened in those final four minutes.
It was just three days short of three years since McColgan won the
world half marathon title on this very course. Her only other
international win since then came just a few weeks later, in the Tokyo
marathon. She stuck her foot down a hole, the start of injury problems
which prompted four different specialists to advise she should quit.
Moses Tanui, the world record holder, headed a Kenyan sweep of the
first three men's places. Springburn-born Paul Evans, fourth, was the
first Briton, with Liz's husband, Peter, 19th in 66-37. Karen Lewis of
Glasgow's Red Star was the second wheelchair woman, while clubmate Ross
Low was second in the men's race. Results:
Men: 1, Moses Tanui 60min 39secs; 2, Benson Masya 61-59; 3, James
Kariuki (all Kenya) 62-29; 4, Paul Evans 62-30; 5, Gary Staines (both
Belgrave) 62-38. Wheelchair: 1, Jack McKenna (Oldham) 52-16; 2, Ross Low
(Red Star) 52-19.
Women: 1, Liz McColgan (Dundee Hawkhill) 71-42; 2, Fatuma Roba
(Ethiopia) 72-05; 3, Manuelo Machado (Portugal) 73-22; 4, Marian Sutton

RALLYING
BROTHERS Alister and Colin McRae looked on course for a double driving
success story yesterday.
Alister went into the record books on Saturday when he became the
third member of the Lanark family to win the British Rally championship.
The McRaes have now won the title an unprecedented eight times; father
Jimmy five times, and Colin twice.
Meanwhile, Colin, driving a Subaru Impreza, was tied with Sweden's
Kenneth Eriksson, in a Mitsubishi Lancer, at the head of Rally
Australia, the sixth round of the world championship, when it halted in
Perth last night.
Third place in his Nissan Sunny GTI on the Manx International Rally,
which finished in Douglas, was enough to give Alister this year's Mobil
1/Top Gear British Rally championship.
The 24-year-old was expected to adopt a cautious approach to the
450-mile rally as fourth place amongst the championship contenders would
guarantee the title. Instead he launched an early attack, ending
Thursday's first leg of seven stages second overall and the leading
championship contender.
During Friday's 14-hour leg he was relegated to third by engine
problems and the loss of auxiliary lights.
On Saturday with nothing to gain and everything to lose, he settled
for third.
''It's good to have the benefit of a family reputation but I've now
proved myself to be competitive in my own right,'' said Alister.
Kilmarnock's Robbie Head, driving a Renault Clio, survived a 100mph
spin and a broken gearbox to finish sixth, two places below his French
team-mate Alain Oreille.
Ayr's Tom Coughtrie brought his Subaru Legacy home in twenty-eighth
place and twelfth in the showroom-car class.
Kelso's Dominic Buckley was forced out when his VW Golf shed a wheel
in Thursday's fifth timed stage. Jock Armstrong from Castle Douglas
overturned his Nissan Sunny twice. On the second occasion the car was
too badly damaged to continue.
The Manx Rally was won by Frank Meagher, from County Tipperaray,
driving a Ford Escort.
Trying to emulate his brother's success, Colin was battling with Swede
Eriksson throughout the second day of the Australia rally.
Eriksson catapulted from fourth to first as he and McRae -- each
seeking their second win of the season -- traded the lead twice during
the day.
''I'm on the limit -- I can't go any faster,'' said McRae. Results:
Manx International Rally. Final Classification after 29 special stages

FINALLY, the Evil Empire strikes back.
The world could be witnessing the beginnings of a fightback, and under
the banner of Brazilian Washington Rodrigues an alarming trend could be
reversed as the rag-tags of football, the journalists, rise up and
prepare to make a stand. With a little slice of good fortune they might
even be able to win back their own business which has been hijacked in
recent years by gangs of washed-up sportspersons.
The members of the fourth estate, as well as those journos in the
electronic media have been swamped by a plethora of pontificators, teams
of talking heads who who are all eager to tell the world how it should
be done while conveniently forgetting that many of them failed to show
how it ought to be done when they themselves were footballers, managers,
tennis players, cricketers, golfers, and rugby players.
It is the strangest thing, this proliferation of former pros who take
up space in press and commentary boxes and television studios. All those
people who, while they were players, refused to talk to us raggedy
hacks, are now in our seats.
However, the rebellion has kicked off. The journalists are revolting
and the lead, appropriately enough, is being offered in Brazil where
football reigns supreme and where Rodrigues is turning the tables by
just having made a spectacular start as the new coach of Flamengo.
Rodrigues, erstwhile radio commentator, now top football coach.
The new man's team beat the Argentinian championship leaders, Velez
Sarsfield, 3-2 in the South American Supercup. Flamengo scored twice in
the last three minutes of a dramatic final in which Velez Sarsfield's
goalkeeper Jose Chilavert hit the Flamengo bar with a free-kick.
Entertainment remains a priority on South American football fields,
especially among keepers as Colombia's Rene Higuita demonstrated at
Wembley recently, although his remarkable save known as the scorpion may
have been part of a hidden agenda. Apparently Higuita features in a
television advertising campaign for a soft drinks company and the save
is part of the commercial.
Performing the acrobatic manoeuvre in which he leaps forward under the
ball before flicking his legs up behind him to clear at Wembley might
have earned him a hansdsome bonus, but there is nothing cynical about
Rodrigues's appointment as coach of Flamengo. It is merely one of the
crazy things which happen from time to time in South American football
and Rodrigues, who has no previous playing or coaching experience, has
stepped into the job with a flamboyance and optimism which defies beief.
He took over in the middle of last week after Edinho was sacked
because the team had suffered three defeats in succession and his win
over Velez Sarsfield was achieved without Romario, who is still
recovering after having fainted during a training session. Perhaps it
was all too much for the Brazilian World Cup star, who had been
criticised fiercely in Rodrigues' radio bulletins.
Rodrigues is said to have likened Romario to a sauna parlour owner in
that he lives off the sweat of others. Although the pair were reported
to have settled their differences, the striker fainted during the new
coach's first training session. Undaunted, the coach sent out his team
which won anyway and sent a clear message all around the world.
No longer will any of us stand in awe when a manager, or even a
so-called superstar footballer speaks and we won't cringe in fear when
the chairman's door at Tannadice swings open. We have been duped long
enough. Don't give me any more of this nonsense about tactics, the job
is pimps. Any old commentator could do it.
Just think, in a few months' time when enough club chairmen and
directors have seen the light we could have Radio Clyde's Dougie
MacDonald named as manager of the month for December for having managed
Partick Thistle to four successive wins. Firhill would be reverberating
to chants of: ''Who ate all the pies?'' as Dougie in his manager's coat
strolled towards the dugout waving to his people.
Up in Aberdeen a new trend could be set . . . the Pittodrie club could
start winning trophies, under the guidance of Hazel Irvine. ''Now be
careful out there. There's a strong wind, so watch your hair doesn't get
messed up. And remember, last one out cleans the bath, and don't leave
the toilet seat up. Just go out there and win for me, boys.
''One more thing, see that no-one kicks little Eoin or Scotty. They're
such lovely wee boys, and Theo . . . maybe you stay behind afterwards. I
want to talk to you about your handling. Seams straight everyone? Right,
off you go.''
Gerry McNee might do a really good job as manager of Rangers, but he
would soon have his chairman, David Murray, in a panic. McNee would want
to keep the fans out so that he could exclusively reveal the result on
Scotsport on a Sunday afternoon when he would also champion the cause of
Richard Gough, just for a wee change.
Celtic could have Chick Young, just for spite. Then again, maybe not
because Fergus McCann might look at his new manager and ask: ''You
trying to take the Michael out of me?''
At least the players would probably be full of praise and inspiration
after the manager's pre-match talks, if only they could understand them.
Me, I wouldn't settle for anything less than the Scotland job and no
manager would refuse me a player for international duty. No sir, not
after I had sent John Hughes, Steven Tweed, and John Inglis, the
Crudefellas, round to collect the players.
Also, I would make radical tactical changes. I would play defenders in
defence, midfield players would play in that area, and forwards would
play up front, and I would always have three goalkeepers in my squad,
Jim Leighton and both Andy Gorams.
So beware, Brown, Smith, Burns, Aitken and co. Some of us hacks are
cheesed off and if any of you suffer three successive defeats,
disgruntled and disillusioned directors know where the real managers are
to be found.
Perhaps I should point out something else before the roles start to be
reversed. When I take over one of your teams and you are all discovering
just how impossible it can be at times to deal with football people,
don't even think about seeking permission to speak to any of my players.
The answer will be ''no''.
Also, my pre-match press conferences will be held at 11pm the night
before in the Press Bar. And you're buying.

GUS Lamond (Haggs Castle) took the Evening Times Tournament of Club
Champions in fine style yesterday at Irvine Bogside.
The 38-year-old Glasgow strokeplay champion, who recently successfully
defended the Eden Tournament at St Andrews, produced sparkling figures
to win his last two matches in the competition.
He was two under par in beating Steven Hunter (Bonnybridge) by 4 and 3
in a semi-final and had five birdies in nine holes against Steven Haugh
(Colville Park) in the final.
Lamond went from one down to five up on the tenth green and ran out a
convincing winner by six and four. Results:
Quarter-finals -- S Hunter (Bonnybridge) beat K Stirling (Millport), 1
hole; G Lamond (Haggs Castle) beat S Gillespie (Cambuslang), 2 and 1; M
Carmichael (Greenock) beat W Gordon (Dougalston), 1 hole; S Haugh
(Colville Park) wo A Reid (Kilmarnock Barassie).
Semi-finals -- Lamond beat Hunter, 4 and 3; Haugh beat Carmichael, at
19th. Final -- Lamond beat Haugh, 6 and 4.
* ELGIN have won the Northern Counties Cup for the first time since
1983. They beat host club Moray by two holes in a local-derby final at
Lossiemouth on Saturday.
Elgin's lead pair in the double foursomes format, Kevin Taylor and Roy
Sinclair, were held to a square game by Moray's Norman Grant and David
Main. Colin Taylor and Steven Milne, the Elgin second string, provided
the trophy-winning margin, by finishing two up on Robbie Sheils and
Steven Leith.
The first Northern Counties Cup tournament was played in 1900. The
three-day tournament was contested by 40 teams this year.
* GLASGOW won the Youths Area Team Trophy on Saturday at Ralston, with
team member and local youth internationalist Alastair Forsyth also
winning the individual prize, the Joe Docherty Trophy, with rounds of 66
and 68 for an eight-under-par total of 134.
Boy internationalists Chris Kelly, of Cawder, and Mark Loftus, of
Cowglen, made up the rest of the Glasgow team which won by 10 shots from
the North with a score of 269. Leading scores:
Team Trophy: 269 -- Glasgow (A Forsyth, C Kelly, M Loftus). 279 --

MARK James has hit back at Tony Jacklin for coming out with more
criticism of Bernard Gallacher and Europe's Ryder Cup committee on the
eve of this week's competition.
Jacklin, who captained Europe to their victories in 1985 and 1987 and
handed over to Gallacher after the 1989 tie, is of the opinion that
Gallacher is not showing the firmness necessary in a captain.
In an interview in the Sunday Telegraph, Jacklin, who has not been
invited to Oak Hill for the match and turned down an invitation to
commentate on television, added: ''Bernard has been quoted many times as
saying he's not a Tony Jacklin and would rather do it through the
committee. Well, in my opinion, the committee doesn't know a thing. The
majority of the people on the Ryder Cup committee are there because of
the kudos.
''Bernard doesn't want the responsibility, but the captain has to have
a firm hand.''
James, not only a member of this week's side but also chairman of the
European Tour's tournament committee, said after finishing the British
Masters yesterday: ''If he is pulling for Europe he would not come out
with this rubbish. He has had his day and I don't know why he is
moaning. It's pathetic really.''
Former Open champion Jacklin, now playing on the US Seniors Tour, also
states in the article that the decision to change from three to two wild
cards is: ''Absolutely the most ridiculous decision that I've ever come
across. They have shot themselves in the foot before the thing starts.
They haven't got the best team they could have.''

IN ENGLAND
FORGET all the pessimism surrounding the prospects of the English
champions. Despite their wretched start to the season, there is
absolutely no reason why Blackburn Rovers cannot avoid relegation from
the Premier League.
After six defeats in eight games, however, world domination has been
put on the back-burner, replaced by the more immediate task of
discovering precisely what is going wrong. ''No cunning . . .
predictable'' was manager Ray Harford's observation in the wake of
Wednesday's home defeat by Spartak Moscow. ''But predictable doesn't
necessarily mean you're easy to stop,'' he added.
Spartak didn't have much trouble in that department, and neither did
Liverpool, who routed Harford's team 3-0 at Anfield on Saturday to leave
them fourth from bottom of the table with almost one-sixth of the league
programme run.
Former Blackburn defender Derek Fazackerley has been recruited from
Newcastle to work on a daily basis with the players as first-team coach.
While the Coca-Cola Cup is normally merely a burden for European Cup
contenders, it will be interesting to see whether Blackburn can find any
form and confidence in it on Wednesday. They would wish for less
demanding opposition than Steve McMahon's Swindon Town, relegated for
two seasons in succession but now the unbeaten leaders of Division 2.
While the champions struggle, those who finished in their immediate
slipstream last season continue to race away. Manchester United's 3-0
victory in their local derby with Bolton was notable for its evidence of
something else that Blackburn do not possess -- a flourishing youth
policy.
Ten of the 14 United players involved on Saturday have come through
the youth system that Alex Ferguson insisted on shaking up when he first
arrived at the club nine years ago.
Newcastle -- buyers rather than breeders -- spent #14m in the
close-season (as opposed to Blackburn's #800,000) and are delighted with
the results -- in every sense. Les Ferdinand, the most expensive
recruit, scored twice more in a 3-1 win over bottom-club Manchester
City. Their only consolation was a fine headed goal by former Celtic man
Gerry Creaney, newly signed from Portsmouth.
Ferdinand's former club, Queen's Park Rangers, produced the surprise
of the day by winning 3-1 away to Leeds, the midweek kings of Monaco.
There was a first Premiership goal for Ruud Gullit in Chelsea's 3-0
success against Southampton, but not for his expensive compatriot Dennis
Bergkamp. He wasted several chances against West Ham as Ian Wright,
having missed one penalty, scored with another to give Arsenal a 1-0
victory. West Ham's tempestuous defender Julian Dicks was sent off for
the ninth time in his career.

SCOTLAND's international players have dismissed the suggestion that
recently retired captain Gavin Hastings might take over as their agent.
Hastings, who last week announced that he was setting up on his own
account in in the sports marketing business with the formation of a
company called Hastings International, had indicated that he would be
interested in becoming the players' agent at this crucial period in the
continuing development of a professional game.
Yesterday at Murrayfield, the squad met the SRU hierarchy for the
first time as a precursor to negotiations which will lead to
international players being placed under contract to the Union before
the first Test match of the season against Western Samoa in November.
Negotiations, and whatever money is eventually agreed, will be
conducted via the players' trust fund and yesterday the players elected
Rob Wainwright and Craig Chalmers as their representatives on the trust.
Their deputies will be Scott Hastings and Graham Shiel. The SRU
representatives will be senior vice-president Fred McLeod, director of
rugby Jim Telfer and Ken Crichton of Stirling County.
However, in a move which strengthens the hand of existing agent Ian
McLauchlan -- who still has 10 months of his contract to run -- the
former Scotland and British Lions' prop was named as the ex-players'
representative on the trust, Iain Milne having decided to stand down.
Yesterday, because the situation is still fluid and with the IB
decision to scrap the amateurism regulations still to be ratified at a
meeting in Tokyo before the end of the month, no serious negotiations
took place and the players will now stage meetings of their own before
agreeing a starting point for negotiations.
McLeod, a Scottish IB representative who was a member of the board's
amateurism working party which paved the way for the historic decision
to declare the game open, said yesterday that he had outlined the
position as it currently existed.
He has previously said that the international squad will receive only
what the game can afford and yesterday he added: ''The players were
extremely sensible and it seems to be that there are no unwarranted
expectations.''
''The players will now be having a meeting of their own and then
coming to me with dates for a further meeting with us once I have
returned from Tokyo on October 2. By the end of the month we should be
in a position to come forward with firm proposals. Gavin Hastings will
not be involved,'' he said.
Rob Wainwright said: ''At the moment we are still waiting for the
outcome of the Tokyo meeting but the players' trust fund will stay in
place. Until the IB has met in Tokyo the SRU have nothing for us and we
having nothing for the SRU. It is very much a waiting game at present.
''At the moment Gavin does not have an organisation in place to deal
with this thing and whether or not he would be interested in the future
is up to him. Gavin is still a close personal friend and just because he
has hung up his boots does not mean we don't talk to him anymore.
''I think that he is interested in moving into this area but,
personally, I don't know what his intentions are,'' added Wainwright.
McLauchlan said: ''When Freddie McLeod comes back from Tokyo then
there will be an early meeting with us and, no doubt, there will then be
full and frank discussions. So far as the trust itself is concerned, I
am doubling up as the ex-player representative.''
* THE concept of a news conference after Watsonians premiership clash
with Melrose at which the media would have the opportunity to question
club benefactor John Connor, president Iain Monteath and Gavin Hastings
about Connor's decision to invest #50,000 at Myreside always had the
capacity for offering a hostage to fortune.
Once Watsonians had been soundly beaten 41-16 by Melrose, the hostage
was well and truly trussed up and must have been wishing he could be
left alone in his darkened room.
''Have some sandwiches boys,'' said Hastings. ''We're not in the mood
for eating,'' added Connor, it must be said, in jest. In truth, all
three parties put on a remarkably brave face as Melrose contrived to
rain on the Myreside parade.
Connor said that the figure that he had initially considered investing
was #100,000, but that had been dependent upon attracting the likes of
Sean Fitzpatrick to Myreside. He had considered other clubs but with
Hastings the main man, he said, Myreside had turned out to be the most
attractive proposition.
Other clubs had been looked at, with Boroughmuir the other favourites,
but Meggetland about to undergo redevelopment, perhaps it had been a
year early for them. ''Who knows, we might look at Boroughmuir next
year,'' he said. In which context, considering his #30,000 investment in
Currie, John Connor might end up with more clubs in his bag than Jack
Nicklaus, or even Tommy Docherty.

DUNCAN Airlie James is a 34-year-old smallish fellow, short like,
muscles though, if not another pick on him. He is very fit indeed. And
he is a kick-boxer and one of the least violent of men, not even in the
ring. He is also so horribly articulate you put your notebook away and
just listen. Now here is a good thing: most people from the martial arts
are the same -- you will not find the serial killers of professional
football in Duncan's business. You will not discover the blatant
spivvery of orthodox boxing in what is one of the fastest-growing sports
in the world.
What you will find are people who speak sincerely about the nature of
their sport. And with a sense of sportsmanship long gone out of most
pastimes. ''Violence is an act, it's not a state of mind,'' said Duncan
to me. ''Anybody who gets involved in violence for its own sake is
committing something. I'm saying that though there is no quarter asked
and no quarter given, I cannot emphasise enough, especially to
youngsters, the ethos of any martial art is respect for others, and
self-esteem.
''If the boxing world has been entangled in racketeering that is
because of the people who administer it and who have little sense of
ethics. The martial arts may not pay as well on the world stage, but we
pay out in ethics.''
Duncan looks as if he spits molten rivets into warships, but talks
like a Harvard professor played by Gary Cooper.
A well-spoken man from the Borders, Duncan played rugby with spirit
and enthusiasm, for Keele School and later with Glasgow High School. He
still loves the game, but his interest in the martial arts, with its
mental and physical discipline, took him eventually to the first rank,
and next Saturday we will see James contesting for the world title
challenge at cruiserweight, (weights in kick-boxing are similar to
conventional boxing), with Holland's Hassan Bibchi at the Easterhouse
Sports Centre at seven o'clock, the first ever world title to be staged
in Scotland.
This is a prestigious event (kick-boxing now has purses going well
into seven figures), and there is to be a civic reception at the City
Chambers next Saturday. Quite right too, for kick-boxing, including
other variations of the sport such as Thai boxing, is very big indeed,
not only in, say, Japan, where more than 30,000 spectators turn up for a
contest, but in North America, Russia, Australia, South Africa, and
altogether the World Kick-boxing Association has 44 countries as
members.
It started a good few years ago but, though the UK is slight in
numbers, it has done extraordinarily well at world level. For perhaps
the same reason as Japan, Scotland has produced an unlikely number of
small, superbly-fit boxers, who have a positively Calvinistic regard for
honour and respect for opponents. And perhaps an exoticism one hardly
expects from an ex-Keele School pupil.
Duncan spent a good few years travelling about as an assistant with
many a rock n'roll band in the States. Indeed, one of his closest chums
is my old mucker, the best Blues-Harp player in Scotland and second only
to myself, Fraser Spiers. I mention this for a reason. Fraser is, like
many another involved in excellence in sport, excellent in other arts
too. Fraser chose to be top in the visual arts (he is a medical
illustrator, as once I was myself), and in music. And he is a fair
athlete himself.
This has to be said: people who excel at sport often do so in other
areas, and martial arts, oft considered to be the proclivity of ripe
thugs, would have no time for hooligans -- they tend to attract bright
and often rather academic and, indeed, middle-class participants. Thus
we have young ex-Hutchie boys like young Mark Scott, who helped out in
Duncan's corner the last time I saw our contender fight in Motherwell
(in which James took a bad knock, but without much harm), or young
entrepreneurs like Stephen Mair or Bill McEvoy, who could talk the legs
off you, or this weekend's supervisor of this world title fight, Joan
Gilmartin, who herself has been a contender at the women's game.
(Incidentally, if you want tickets for next Sat. contact the lady at the
ticket centre in Glasgow -- 0141-227-5511).
Worth your while if you are into top sport. For also there that night,
and doing a tour of Scotland with seminars for the young, the old, the
hopeful, is none other than William Wallace. No, it isn't the Braveheart
boy. It is the United States of America's Bill ''Superfoot'' Wallace,
the top kick-boxer in the world. Wallace is the undisputed world
champion at super-middleweight, himself 48 years of age and with world
titles stretching from the World Karate Fighting Champion in 1969 to one
of the undeniably top martial arts exponent in the world. He it is who
coaches many fight sequences in most of the movies you see where
muscle-bound actors look great but couldn't use a pencil, for heaven's
sake. Wallace will be touring Scotland and damned glad the kick-boxing
association is to get him.
Of course this is a big event for Scottish kick-boxing. It is big for
Duncan Airlie James, who, as a professional in a sport which hardly
boasts much of a steady income, will go on to a world arena in which
money will increasingly pay for his dedication. It may even assist young
Joan Gilmartin to spread more finance out for younger up-and-coming
hopefuls. I hope so.
For the neds and thugs of Glasgow who think violence is a culture they
invented, it would help to see the discipline of this sport in which,
oddly, violence doesn't play a part at all.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
HUNTLY player-manager Doug Rougvie told yesterday how he refused to
let Highland League Cup hero Marco de Barros leave the field just
minutes before his spectacular extra-time winner.
The winger was still hobbling from a hefty first-half collision with
Cove's Kerr Gibson when he conjured up a sensational score to give
Huntly a 2-1 victory over Cove Rangers.
The 24-year-old former Motherwell player took the ball on a meandering
run on the left flank, then cut inside and lashed a 20-yard drive past
keeper Ray Charles.
Former Aberdeen and Chelsea player, Rougvie, said yesterday: ''The
bench were screaming at me to take Marco off. They thought he was
limping too badly, but there was no way I was letting him leave. I knew
we couldn't afford to lose him. And Marco certainly proved me right.''
The goal, with just eight minutes of extra-time left, was a cruel blow
to Cove, who more than contributed to a tense, exciting 50th final on a
slippery surface.

BOXING
KEITH Knox, the former ABA flyweight champion from Bonnyrigg, tops the
bill at the St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow tonight and sees this
as an important season for himself.
The little fellow is unbeaten in seven professional fights and his
manager, Tommy Gilmour, feels that he is not far away from getting a
shot at the British title. To do that, of course, he has to keep his
unbeaten record, and tonight the man who stands in his way is
Leicester's Sean Norman.
Knox has been out of action for four months, but his aggressive style
should be enough to see him through this one and take him a step further
along the road to his immediate aim of a British title fight.
Tommy Quinn, from Tranent, the younger brother of super-middleweight
Willie, also puts his unbeaten record on the line at welterweight
against Sunderland's Shaun O'Neill, while Barrhead lightweight Mark
Breslin, one of the most exciting young boxers in the country, will be
going for his sixth pro win against Mike Watson, of Leicester.
There is also a bit of a rarity on tonight's bill -- a Scottish
heavyweight. Former amateur champion Colin Brown makes his professional
debut against Declan Faherty, of Huddersfield.

DIVISION THREE
INJURIES have made East Stirlingshire's season a nightmare following a
promising opening-day win away to second division Clyde in the Coca-Cola
Cup.
The Falkirk side remain pointless after five league defeats, the
latest by 1-0 at Hampden. 'Shire manager Billy Little revealed that
eight members of his first-team squad are out injured.
Ironically, Queen's Park scored through Ross Caven, who himself had
been doubtful for the match.
Top of the division on goal difference are Ross County, thanks to a
late flurry at home to Albion Rovers. New signing Colin Milne and Brian
Grant hit doubles in a 5-1 win.
Livingston maintained their 100% league record with a 2-0 home win
over Alloa, with goals by Stewart Williamson and Craig Smart.
Also on the 12-point mark are Brechin, Ralph Brand scoring the only
goal at Cowdenbeath.
Caley Thistle continue to struggle away from Inverness. Steve
McCormick volleyed Arbroth in front and David Pew restored the lead late
on after Ian Stewart's equaliser.

GYMNASTICS
STEVEN Frew celebrated his selection for Britain's world championship
team by winning the Scottish gymnastics title at Perth yesterday. The
Alloa man totalled 100.8 to beat his arch rival, Derek Callaghan, from
Falkirk, with 96.35.
Frew, the first Scottish male artistic gymnast to qualify for a UK
team, leaves for the world event in Japan next weekend.
Frew's consistency in recent UK internationals against Australia,
Romania, and Bulgaria, where he finished fourth, confirmed his selection
for the seven-strong team.
His points totals have increased to over 53.00, a huge improvement,
akin to an international sprinter knocking .40 off his 100m time.
''But we will be under a lot of pressure in Japan,'' says the
22-year-old Alloa gymnast. ''We have to finish among the top 12 in order
for Britain to be allowed to send a gymnastics team to the Atlanta
Olympics.
'' We will be vying for eleventh or twelfth place, going by last
year's totals.''
Though still broke and sponsorless, Frew at least has the satisfaction
of having achieved one of his goals. ''The next is a Commonwealth Games
medal in 1998.'' Results:
Youth: A Buchanan (Dunfermline) 80.7. Intermediate 1: I Thomson
(Falkirk) 59.55. Intermediate 2: A Smith (Kestrel) 70.02. Intermediate
3: A Morris (Kestrel) 65.1.

Hibernian 1, Aberdeen 1
SCORING first is not the hard part so far as Aberdeen are concerned.
Just as they had done in their previous match against Celtic, the
Pittodrie side moved in front against Hibernian at Easter Road on
Saturday, but failed to hold on to their advantage, although this time
they were left with a point for effort.
Aberdeen's difficulty appears to lie in trying to kill off opponents
when in a strong position and that is a trait they will have to add to
their arsenal if they are to challenge powerfully for the
premier-division championship.
Their work-rate can't be faulted, but while that might prove to their
supporters -- who were dragged into the depths of despair last season
when relegation almost sucked the club under -- that they are determined
to get it right, sweat alone doesn't win prizes. Players have to be
mean, in that when they have an edge, they make it count by pressing
harder and punishing the other side.
Still, Roy Aitken seems to be getting a decent response from his
players, who also look as though the memories of last season remain
frightfully vivid and, if northing else, that should keep their
concentration strong.
The manager knows he is short of at least a couple of players and he
hopes the club's shares issue will be successful leaving him with some
money enter the transfer market, but Celtic's issue apart, there are not
many clubs who have been able to attract handsome sums in this manner.
Aitken will be given money, but it won't be much, which means he will
have to display a penchant for seeking out a bargain.
In the meantime, Eoin Jess, operating in midfield, could move forward
a little more, because at Easter Road he was usually to be found too
deep to inflict any real damage, and the front players were not given
the kind of service needed to pull Hibs' defensive forces apart.
Indeed, it took a special contribution from Duncan Shearer, who missed
the start of the season because of suspension and injury, to give his
side then lead in 73 minutes.
The striker had been sent on to take over from Scott Booth only a few
minutes earlier and Hibs made the mistake of leaving him some space to
manoeuvre. Shearer played the ball to Joe Miller, who had been lurking
on Aberdeen's right, and peeled away into the middle where his run was
tracked only by Miller.
The ball was returned and Shearer sensed his opportunity while Gordon
Hunter, normally an astute defender, allowed Shearer time to swing at
the ball which travelled about 22 yards before snuggling into the net at
Jim Leighton's right-hand corner. It was a splendid goal, although Hibs'
manager Alex Miller was not at all happy.
''Duncan tends to hit early and, having worked with him while on
Scotland duty, you know when he is setting up. I knew he was going to
hit. I knew right away,'' Miller said.
Fortunately, some of the force was taken out of Miller's wrath when
Darren Jackson equalised a couple of minutes later.
His goal also was particularly classy. Andy Millen saw him make a run
towards the right-hand side of Aberdeen's box and chipped the ball
forward, leaving Jackson to make the rest look remarkably simple.
Without stopping, he took the ball on his chest, then a thigh, and
from just inside the penalty box, he hit a low shot across Theo Snelders
who could do little to prevent the goal because of the accuracy of
Jackson's strike.
The draw was a fair reflection on a match which was always busy and
which had some moments when skill shone through apart from the goals,
although there could have been more about which to enthuse had players
such as Michael O'Neill, Jess, Miller, Pat McGinlay and Stephen Glass
contributed more.
O'Neill, in fact, should have scored late in the game, but after
having surged into Aberdeen's box, he allowed John Inglis to get close
enough to put him off.
Kevin Harper, who was a substitute for Gareth Evans, also should have
scored after he had been played clear inside Aberdeen's box, but he
mishit a shot which he would normally have placed in the net.
However, neither side was too unhappy at having taken a point and
Aberdeen continue to show encouraging signs of health, although Shearer
believes they have much to do yet.
''I suppose with the way we are playing just now you could say we are
putting the past behind us,'' he said, ''but we owe the fans a lot more.
After all, you can't erase with a couple of games what happened last
season. It was a frightening time for all of us.
''Last week, we were in front and again this week, yet we didn't kill
the games off and that is something we don't want to let creep into our
play.''

AMONG the great unanswered and probably unanswerable questions of our
time are: ''Why is Jim Farry?'' and ''What is the Scottish Football
Association for?''
I have long had the feeling that the fat cats up in Park Gardens need
the game of football to sustain their lifestyles, but that the game of
football does not need them.
A glance at a 20-page document issued by the SFA on arrangements for
the recent Scotland-Finland game at Hampden, or the National Stadium as
we must now call it, shows that Scottish football's bureaucracy is in a
healthy state.
The document, bearing the imprimatur of chief executive Farry, lists
23 different varieties of tickets that the SFA had produced for the
match -- in addition, of course, to the briefs for which the fans had
handed over their hard-earned #10 to #15. Each of the 23 tickets has to
have a distinctive colour and some psychologist with an interest in
football may one day produce a thesis on the subject.
Tickets allowing entrance to the directors' box are ''cool grey'' in
colour. Purple will get you into the boardroom, turquoise into the tea
room. Passes issued to the gentlemen of the press are brown, but who is
to say this is any kind of statement of opinion on the part of the SFA.
Other colours brought into play to cover the many categories are
lilac, lemon, mint, mauve, sea blue, ''flu orange,'' and ''flu yellow.''
You certainly cannot fault the Park Gardens boys on their knowledge and
use of colours.
The document contains a diagram of a technical area, the modern bus
shelter structure which has replaced the dugout. The rules are very
strict about how many can be accommodated in the bus shelter and how far
the team manager and coaching staff can leap out to complain about the
ref or urge their players to greater efforts. (Not very far; only one
metre).
I have looked again and again at the section of this illustration
which features the five substitutes. No matter how you count it, the
five players have only nine legs among them. We can only imagine that
one of the players has lost a leg in a challenge from some latter-day
John Greig and has been substituted, but refuses to go to hospital until
he sees how the match finishes.
The document sets out the strict rules under the Public Order Act and
the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act, which means that any fan trying to
smuggle in a ''controlled container'' such as can of shandy, or who has
had a couple of dry sherries too many, can be hauled away by the forces
of law and order and consigned for the rest of his or her natural life
to a Michael Forsyth prison work gang.
But no such worries for the SFA fat cats and their guests whose needs
are catalogued in some detail under the heading ''hospitality.'' It is a
long shift for these boys.
The Finland game had an 8pm kick-off, but at 4pm there is a ''full bar
to account (130 persons) in Hampden Lounge 1.'' At 4.30pm the ''match
function'' begins in Hampden Lounge 2.
At 6.30pm the ''full bars to account'' are in swing in Lounge 1 (130
persons), the Club Tea Room (25 persons) and the Boardroom (50 persons,
don't forget your cool grey ticket).
At half-time, the 200 or so SFA fat cats and guests are back at the
trough for a buffet with tea and coffee. Full-time sees these controlled
containers, now swollen to 330 in number, back to their respective
Hampden lairs for ''full bar and remaining buffet.'' The lower orders --
journalists, broadcasters, and bandsmen -- get tea, coffee, and pies.
A footnote informs us that the SFA ''shall provide the main
ingredients of the bar stock (whisky gin, vodka, brandy, and beers) for
all areas.'' This raises at least a couple of questions: Who does Jim
Farry send to the cash and carry for this obviously huge cairry-oot? And
how much does the SFA spend each year on all this hospitality.
And a last question. Can anybody up there at Park Gardens get me some
cool grey tickets for Scotland's Euro '96 matches in England next year?
I'm very cheap to run. A pie, a cup of tea, and perhaps a glass of
robust red and I'll never say a rude word about the SFA ever again.

BOWLS
SCOTLAND'S junior produced three battling performances in Leamington
Spa to beat England, Ireland, and Wales and claim the junior home
international championship for the first time.
Scotland set themselves up for their title win when they edged out
England 112-111 on Saturday morning, then recovered to beat Ireland
125-121 later in the day, and wrapped up their title when they beat
Wales 124-114.
Against England they trailed from the opening ends and were still
78-85 down with six to play before staging their late rally for the
narrowest of wins.
Both sides finished with three winning rinks with Windygates' Colin
Falconer laying the victory foundations with a 24-14 win over Kevin
Cousins. Kevin Harper from Dalbeattie added a 20-14 win over Nick Jones
and East Lothian Co-op's Scott Dodds edged out Les Gillett 18-16.
The Scots managed just two winning rinks in their 125-121 win over
Ireland with Maybole's Graeme Campbell beating Mark Shannon 21-10, and
Headwell's Mark Allison adding a 24-17 win over William Keys but the
Scots revival was sparked by Tullibody's Iain Sneddon who counted seven
shots on the last end to push the Scots in front at a vital stage
although Sneddon still finished a 21-22 loser against Cliff Dennison.
That left Scotland needing a draw or better against the defending
champions Wales in their concluding match yesterday, but after having
taken an early lead, the Scots saw Wales hit back to move 18 shots ahead
around the three-quarter mark. But a great finish took them to the win.
Kevin Harper returned a 31-18 win over Jonathon Britton, Graeme Campbell
beat Paul Diment 27-12 and Iain Sneddon gave Scotland their third win
edging out Iron Thomas 20-17.
* DEFENDING champion Paul Conlan from Midlothian, eased through to the
televised semi-final stages of the CIS Insurance National Indoor Singles
championship at Coatbridge in November when he finished off the weekend
playdown at Dundee with a 21-8 quarter final win over Bainfield's Robert
Marshall.
Joining Conlan in the last four are Midlothian clubmate David Peacock,
East Lothian's Angus Blair, and Cumbernauld's David Miller, who complete
an all-international line-up.
Blair, bidding to be only the fourth player to complete the double of
indoor and outdoor national titles, lived dangerously before edging out
Arbroath's Darren Burnett 21-20 and Peacock kept alive fopes of an all
Midlothian final when he beat the 1993 runner up Alan Milne from
Aberdeen 21-16.

JOHNNY Lothian returned to Menzieshill on Saturday and helped
mastermind the shock of the day in the first series of matches in the
men's national league.
Lothian, a product of Menzieshill's youth section, spent the past five
seasons with Insights Inverleith, but in his comeback with the
Taysiders, he set up three goals in their 4-0 defeat of MIM.
Without him, Inverleith crashed 3-1 to defending champions Grange.
Touche Ross Gordonians were involved in another surprise scoreline at
Torbrex Wanderers, where they set the seal on their victory with three
goals in the opening 25 minutes, Richard Freeland twice hitting the
target.
Kelburne, in drawing 2-2 with Clydesdale, are unlikely to be
harbouring thoughts of grandure this term, but in beating Tender
Uddingston 8-0, Western confirmed they could launch a genuine challenge
for honours. Results:
National League. Division 1 -- Clydesdale 2, Kelburne 2; Grange 3,
Insights Inverleith 1; Torbrex Wanderers 1, Touche Ross Gordonians 3;
MIM 0, Menzieshill 4; Western 8, Tender Uddingston 0. Division 2 --

Ruthrieston 1; EK Strathmore 2; West Cars Motherwell 2, Clydebank 1.
Division 4 -- Stirling University 1, Hillhead 2; Grange 2, Inveresk 2;
Kirkcaldy 1, Monifieth 2.
* THE need for change in the women's domestic programmed was
emphasised once again when Western Klick Photopoint, league winners for
the past 13 years, opened their campaign by overwhelming Boroughmuir
10-0.
It might well have been more had Susan MacDonald, the Scotland and
Great Britain striker, been on duty. In her absence through injury the
main scorers were Wendy Fraser, Maureen White, Gail Crawford, and Jane
Burley who scored two goals apiece.
Edinburgh Ladies also made a winning start to their campaign despite
being without four of their regulars. They overcame Royal High Gymnasts
4-3, with Rhona Simpson completing her hat trick when scoring their
winner 20 minutes from time.
The only bright note in Scotland's games in the Four Nations' Under 21
tournament at Cardiff was the brilliant performance of keeper Claire
Murphy yesterday in containing tournament winners Germany to a 3-0
victory. Results:
National League. Division 1 -- Edinburgh Ladies 4, Royal High Gymnasts
3; Western Klick Photopoint 10, Boroughmuir 0. Division 2 -- Melrose
Croall Bryson 3, Grange 1; Aberdeen Bon Accord 4, Eglinton 2; Stepps 0,

Hawick 14, Boroughmuir 23
LINEOUT and turnover advantage as well as keener incisiveness from a
back division astutely orchestrated by Sean Lineen contributed to
Boroughmuir's success at Mansfield Park against Hawick.
This went some way towards alleviating the pain of midweek disaster at
Melrose but lost authority from their back play with injury to Scott
Welsh.
The telescopic Darren George, from Auckland, Darren Burns and Stuart
Reid gave Boroughmuir an edge at throw in and at restarts.
It was indicative of Hawick's over concession of offence kicks that
Andrew Knight had 11 shots at penalty goals and, whilst never appearing
quite to strike perfect timing, piloted over six.
Considering that he had to take in new signals on Thursday, deputy
scrum half Alan Gray performed creditably but Tony Stanger was too well
policed to make heavy impact, and it fell to Welsh, with Renwick a
support ally, to pose the keenest threat.
Welsh, had a hand in most Hawick scores, with a penalty goal and drop
goal for 6-9 at half time, then a clean, narrow side incision for
Renwick's try. The other Hawick score was Colin Turnbull's penalty goal.
The Boroughmuir try was a peach. Derek Stark made inroads in midfield,
the halves switched right and Lineen and Alastair Cadzow worked Reid in
at the corner.
Hawick -- C Turnbull; D S Grant, C A Murray, A G Stanger, G W J Sharp;
W Welsh, A Gray; B J McDonnell, J A Hay, K B Scott, I Elliot, A Imray, D
J Turnbull, B L Renwick, J Graham. Replacement: J Craig for Welsh (47
mins).
Boroughmuir -- N R Mardon; D A Stark, D Macrae, S R P Lineen, A R
McLean; A J Knight, A G Beveridge; J D Wilson, N R B Dickson, P H
Wright, D G Burns, D L George, A M Cadzow, S J Reid, S L Wands.
Replacement: R McCurry for Mardon (15 mins), N McCallum for Wands (46
mins).
Referee -- J Steele (Dumfries).
SCORERS: Hawick -- Renwick 1t, Welsh 1p, 1dg, C W Turnbull 1p;

SHOWJUMPING
BRITAIN'S Nick Skelton picked up another of the season's major prizes
when he won the Pavarotti International Grand Prix with Showtime in San
Marino yesterday.
Skelton collected a first prize of #60,000 with three clear rounds,
the last against the clock in 41.5 seconds.
Skelton, also winner of the Volvo World Cup in April, had the only
clear in a five-horse jump-off, finishing ahead of Germany's Otto
Becker, on Hermann's Bellenuit. Switzerland's Urs Fah, on Jeremiah, who
also had a fence down in clocking more than a second slower, was third.

SAILING
TWO teenage brothers sailed off with the top award, the Murray
Seafoods Trophy, at the 110-boat regatta on the Holy Loch at the
weekend.
Local boys Neil Towart, 15, at the helm, and Euan, 13, his crew,
crafted three consecutive victories in Class Eight, staying unbeaten in
their 10ft 10in Mirror dinghy.
Members of the Holy Loch Sailing Club, the youngsters are growing in
stature on the Scottish junior and mirror class scene.
Already this season they have taken second place at the mirror
Scottish championship and equal first at the Scottish junior
championships.
Class 1 went to Andy Lawson, who skippered Geronimo, the former French
Admiral's Cup 50-footer, to two firsts.
The strongest handicap keelboat class proved to be Class 3 with 17
boats, an equal mix of Sonatas and Pipers. It was won by Diana, steered
by John Hunt, who also took Last week's Scottish Sonata Championship.
The Clyde racetrack's third contest was abandoned due to an absence of
wind. Results:
Murray Seafoods Regatta, Holy Loch: Class One -- 1, Geronimo (A
Lawson) 1.5 points; 2, Flying Colours (A Marr) 5; 3, Mr Vain (F Lee) 6.
Sportboat Class -- 1, Tunnock's Teacake (J Donaldson) 1.5; 2, Double

PLANS to invest up to #20,000 in the sport in Glasgow took a major
step forward on Saturday, not only because newly-constituted Team
Glasgow formed the nucleus of a Scottish squad which beat the rest of
the United Kingdom.
Scotland, with seven Glasgow lifters in their nine-strong team at the
British under-18 championships in Easterhouse, finished joint winners
with South-west Counties, their first victory in the event.
There were silver medals from Team Glasgow's Mark Baer (59 kilos) who
lifted 167.5k, and Kilmarnock's Brian Bamford (64k) who totalled 175k,
plus bronze from the Glasgow trio of Kevin McGowan (59k: 160k), Jason
Baird (64k: 152.5k) and David Owens (79k: 187.5k).
Their efforts saw McGowan and Bamford promoted to the UK under-18
squad, and British under-15 champion Gordon Cameron (Easterhouse) gained
entry to the UK under-16 squad.
Prior to the contest the city's development plan received support in
principal at a meeting attended by the Scottish Sports Council, British
and Scottish Amateur Weightlifting Associations, Glasgow's Parks and
Recreation Department, Britain's Strongest Schoolboy movement, and
Easterhouse Community Empowerment.

West of Scotland 16, Currie 33
IF a transfer market ever really gets going in the brave new world of
rugby union, then West of Scotland will be among the first to dip in.
They will be looking for a player, preferably a forward, who has that
powerful combination of experience and nous which allows him to play the
referee at those vital moments.
He will be able to give them that cutting edge which has been missing
in this up and down start to the season.
It is not intended for a moment to take anything away from the
undoubted talents and Herculean efforts of this young West side.
But it is just that -- a young West side which lacks the experience to
allow them to exploit the less savoury aspects of the game.
Currie, on the other hand, continue with that no-nonsense approach to
the game which does not always win them friends when they travel but
which sure is effective.
They quite clearly deserve to be leaders of Division 2 and have a
return to the top flight firmly in their sights.
And what every disgruntled supporter screaming from the touchline
should remember is that if the whistle doesn't blow the opposition
aren't offside.
Ally Donaldson consistently shines as a genuine playmaker in the
Currie side and he works superbly with his fellow backs.
He must also be popular with the pack as he is not one of those guys
who hoists hard-won ball to little effect.
There is also a finishing punch available for Currie, which seems
lacking for West, through Colin Robertson and Geoff Keen on the wings.
Once again West conceded too many penalties and were made to suffer by
dead-eye Donaldson, whose haul of 18 points did much to boost a
scoreline which belied the real gap between the teams.
David Barrett put in a better all-round performance than when last
sighted but let a few genuine kicking chances slip by.
He should also know better by now than to think referees can be swayed
by argument or displays of petulance. On the contrary, Dave.
Fraser Stott seems to be revelling in his role of captain, the back
row is quick and eager, and the Bulloch brothers play a part in
everything that is good in this promising side.
Alan is learning quickly the huge gulf he has crossed into senior
rugby and already seems a better player for it.
And hats off to young David Jamieson who was catapulted into the first
team front row following the last minute defection of Sandy Crear to Ayr
and has risen tremendously well to the challenge.
The game began at a frantic pace, promising much but delivering a
little less.
Donaldson's brace of penalty goals to one by Barrett was enough to
give Currie the half-time lead.
The two stand-offs again traded penalty goals, two apiece, to keep the
gap to three points. Then came a six minute spell which made grown men
wince on the West touchline.
The home side were pressing when possession was lost and Currie
counter attacked through Donaldson and Dean Sheppard.
Stewart Hardie provided the link at pace and sent Robertson racing
over for a try of the highest quality which Donaldson converted.
He then added goal points to Michael Plumb's well-taken try after the
West defence was unable to cope with a Donaldson garryowen.
The third try was just reward for Fraser Thomson as Currie again
turned defence into attack through Doug Rogerson and Plumb. Donaldson
converted.
David Riding's try in the closing seconds, converted by Barratt, was a
deserved consolation for keeping up the fight for what had become
something of a lost cause.
Currie go from strength to strength while West have much to do if the
cause is not to be lost entirely come mid season. There is a lot of
growing up to be done and very little time in which to do it.

Kelso 16, Jed-Forest 8
A RESOLUTE defence and the ability to turn chances into points earned
Kelso their first victory in the premiership as they dented the
aspirations of the previously unbeaten Jed-Forest at Poinder Park.
Kelso full back Graeme Aitchison's 100% goal-kicking display was in
marked contrast to the visitors, for whom Chris Richards and Harry Hogg
contrived to miss all but one of their eight attempts at goal.
Although it was ultimately not to be Jed-Forest's day, if games were
won on pressure, they should have been out of sight by half-time.
The visitors dominated the first half, their back row leading the pack
in drives deep into enemy territory, but time after time the moves broke
down through the wrong option being taken or through over-elaboration.
It was frustrating stuff for the Jed support as they saw their team
set up strong attacking positions only to watch the Kelso defence turn
over possession at the breakdown. On the occasions when the ball was
moved out, there was a lack of sharpness which gave Jed coach Donald
Millar little to smile about.
Three first-half penalty attempts by Richards, all from kickable
positions, went adrift before, following a final 10 minutes of intense
pressure, Jed again earned a chance to equalise Aitchison's opening
penalty goal for Kelso.
But Hogg proved no more successful than his full back, the ball
dropping wide. Jed supporters breathed a sigh of relief four minutes
into the second period when Richards slotted a penalty goal.
With Kelso's lead regained after Aitchison kicked a second penalty
goal, a sense of desperation began to creep into Jed-Forest's game, and
when a loose pass was exploited by Adam Roxburgh, Kelso took the play to
a line out near the Jed line.
They won the ball, and with Aitchison coming into the line, Stuart
Lang sprinted over at the corner to score. Aitchison converted and added
a third penalty goal before Jed at last, with only four minutes left,
breached the Kelso defence -- Richards claiming an unconverted try.
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, R Laing, G Laing, S Lang; K Utterson, P
Dunkley; J Ramage, K Thomson, M Pearson, S Rowley, I Fullerton, S
Bennett, A Roxburgh, J Jeffrey.
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; S Turnbull, H Hogg, D Scott, M Yule; K Amos,
C Laidlaw; N McIlroy, C Brown, G Kerr, C Hynd, A Dunnet, K Armstrong, D
Foster, R Kirkpatrick.
Referee -- Jim Fleming (Boroughmuir).

Partick Thistle 2, Hearts 0
PROVING a point to win three was what it was all about for Partick
Thistle at the weekend. Their courage has never been in doubt, nor their
willingness to shed every drop of sweat necessary.
We were made aware of those qualities in their magnificent fight to
retain premier division status last season -- but the Firhill men want
to be recognised as footballers who can also play a bit.
On Saturday, they never looked in any danger against Hearts, scoring a
goal in each half to maintain their unbeaten record for the season, and
at times, when they weren't thumping the ball as far away from keeper
Nicky Walker as possible, they did turn on a bit of style.
Afterwards, manager Murdo MacLeod said: ''Their attitude was superb.
Their pride was hurt after last week when they took a lot of stick after
the 1-1 draw at Motherwell, and today they felt they had to prove a
point. I've got to give credit to every one of them.''
Two players, however, were a bit more deserving than the others --
left back Steve Pittman and striker Wayne Foster. Both should have been
sitting in the stand nursing injuries, but told the manager they were
willing to give it a go.
Foster, in fact, had to take pain killers for a back injury and
eventually, when the effects were wearing off, he had to be substituted.
But while on the field, he did a superb job, as did Pittman throughout
the 90 minutes.
Said Foster: ''I shouldn't really have played, but when Rod McDonald
called off late with flu, I told the boss I was willing to give it a
try. Like the rest of the lads, I was a bit annoyed at the stick we had
taken after the Motherwell match. I thought we deserved better.''
Foster was also annoyed at being booked during the second half when he
felt Thistle should have had a penalty. That came when Hearts keeper
Henry Smith lost the ball to his former team mate, then appeared to foul
Foster as the striker was about to score.
I would agree with the player, but at the end of the day Thistle
didn't need a penalty. They scored a marvellous goal after just 11
minutes when Kevin McKee turned the Hearts defence with a cut back, and
Derek McWilliams beat Smith with a drive from 15 yards.
Then, with just a minute left, youngster Stephen Docherty, who had
come on for Foster, clinched the victory with a beautiful header
following some great work down the right by Ian Cameron.
Hearts just did not compete at the same level and afterwards manager
Jim Jefferies, suffering his first defeat in charge at Tynecastle, said:
''I told the players that, whether they like it or not, that first and
foremost in this division you have to work really hard.
''Just look at last season. Dundee United, with all their good
players, were relegated, and Aberdeen just got their act together in
time.''

Dundee High School FP 19, Selkirk 0
DESPITE the legislative changes taking place at the highest levels in
rugby, it is heartening to know there is a still a place for humour in
the game -- even in defeat.
Selkirk's Rodney Pow -- often their match winner in the past -- had a
wretched game against Dundee. Not only did he miss five penalty attempts
and guddle the odd pass, with the Dundee line at his mercy, the normally
quick-silver winger was dumped into touch at the corner flag by John
Jardine's cover tackle.
In the bar afterwards Pow shrugged his shoulders and quipped: ''Never
mind, I've got my lottery ticket.''
Selkirk coach John Rutherford felt that if even a couple of the
penalties had gone over it would have given his side a boost. But he
stated emphatically that: ''The better side won.''
In contrast, Dundee coach Tom Dymock was pleased with his side's play.
There were two major aspects in producing a much-improved performance
over their previous home outing. ''Chris Robinson at stand-off makes a
big difference and we concentrated on keeping the ball in the hands,''
said Dymock.
Robinson, however, can have no place in the Scotland set up, given
that he is a New Zealander. He is one of those gifted footballers who
can run, pass, and kick almost effortlessly, has guile and vision, and
is not afraid to work hard at his defensive chores.
Derek Milne, revelling in the freedom of openside flanker, had another
storming game for Dundee and opened the scoring. He burst on to Scott
Adam's line out tap and did a fair impression of ''Lomu versus Catt'' on
Selkirk winger Darren Hulme.
Robinson, Paul Rouse, and Steve Newton dented the visitors' defence,
and from a quickly taken free kick, big Gregor Hayter breenged through
for a try as the two front rows had a minor set-to.
The icing on the cake came with a glorious sweeping try just after the
hour mark. Robinson zipped a pass into space for Rouse to burst on to,
and as he was closed down he put Mike Cousin clear with a clever inside
pass. Robinson added the goal points as he had to the first try.
Dundee High School FP -- S Newton; M Cousin, P Rouse, D Hamilton, J
Jardine; C Robinson, G Sandford; S Lithgow, G Scott, N Robertson, S
Adam, S Campbell, G Hayter, P Carnegie, D Milne.
Selkirk -- J Brett; R Pow, K Johnston, D Gage, D Hulme; S Nicholl, S
Tomlinson; B Johnston, D Graham, S McColm, K McConnell, D Cameron, W

SCOTLAND have again been hit by an injury hoodoo ahead of the Four
Nations' youth tournament at Forthbank this week.
The Scots open in Stirling tomorrow against Belgium and will meet
Holland on Thursday and Denmark on Saturday.
But Rangers striker David Graham was yesterday pulled out of the
under-17 squad after having suffered ligament damage last week. And St
Mirren's Gavin Galloway is a major doubt as he has a poisoned toe.
Coach Ross Mathie said: ''I am waiting on a final decision on Galloway
before deciding who I will call into the squad.''

DIVISION TWO
THE form book pointed to unbeaten East Fife, but those who know the
history of the fixture were not surprised when Stranraer beat the
leaders 2-0 on Saturday.
East Fife had not conceded a goal for four-and-a-half games until
Darren Henderson turned Tommy Sloan's header in 10 minutes after the
break. Two minutes from time Billy Ferguson sealed the win.
Sharing the lead are Forfar. Another solo goal by David Bingham gave
them the lead, Steve Cody equalised for Queen of the South and Bobby
Mann got the winner with a header. The visitors from Dumfries had keeper
Jim Butter sent off.
Terry Christie would not be happy that Stenhousemuir's Lloyd Haddow
was red carded at Berwick, where Ian Little missed a penalty in the 3-1
defeat. A Paul Rutherford goal was the only score until Willie Irvine's
late double sandwiched Jim Henderson's counter.
Headers by John Gibson and Craig Taggart gave Stirling Albion the
points as Ayr tumbled to a fourth straight defeat, while Montrose gained
their first point when Clyde failed to find the net.

A GOAL six minutes from time took Maryhill through to the second round
of the Whyte &amp; MacKay Cup.
Beith took the lead at Lochburn Park with a Billy Borthwick strike,
but they were reduced to 10 men following the dismissal of full-back
Graham.
Maryhill took command, but despite constant pressure, it was eight
minutes from time before the breakthrough came. Full back Kennedy,
pushed forward into attack, got the equaliser, then two minutes later,
Jamie Rodden dived to head home a Simon Black cross to give Maryhill a
deserved 2-1 win.
Largs Thistle travelled to meet Petershill hoping to build on the 13
goals they had scored in their last two games since the resignation of
manager Davie McKellar. However, it took an O'Neill equaliser to give
them a replay at Barrfields Park. Scott Gilbertson had headed Petershill
in front.
Stuart Millar's revitalised Carluke Rovers provided the shock result
of the day with their 1-0 defeat of Glenafton. A Scott Cochrane goal six
minutes into the second half against a 10-man Glenafton took Carluke
through to Tuesday's second round draw.
After having lost 13 goals in two games, Irvine Victoria bounced back
to beat St Anthony's 6-2. Two first-half goals by youngster Ian Hollis
and a double in the last 10 minutes by Ryan Dick, helped give them a
convincing victory.
Winton Rovers' troubles on and off the park continued on Saturday when
manager Davie McIlroy resigned after the 6-2 defeat by Vale of Leven.
Highest score of the day was Glencairn's 9-0 defeat of Hurlford.
Cup-holders Shettleston had a narrow 3-2 win over Ashfield.
Blantyre Vics' preparation for next week's Abercorn League Cup Final
suffered a setback with their 1-0 defeat at Annbank.
A Davie Flynn double kept Camelon at the top of the John Walker League
following their 4-2 win against Armadale.
Linlithgow's 2-0 victory over high-flying Harthill kept them in second
spot. Striker McMurray sealed the points with Rose's second goal, but
was eventually ordered off along with Harthill's Van Nuill.
Camelon will celebrate their 75th anniversary and last year's OVD Cup
win by playing a Scottish Junior Select at Carmuirs Park on Sunday,
October 22.
St Joseph's 4-1 defeat of Arbroath keeps them at the top of the AT&amp;T

THE word of the week is hype, which is defined in the columnar
dictionary as meaning intensive or artificially induced excitement
about, or enthusiasm for, something or someone.
Alternatively, it may mean a sales gimmick, a publicity stunt or the
person and thing promoted by such a stunt.
The words Watsonians, damp, and squib do not appear anywhere in the
text but after the announcement that John Connor is to inject not
#200,000, not #100,000 but #50,000 into the Myreside club, maybe the
lexicographers will be rushing out a late-final edition.
Snide? Maybe. Unfair? Probably not. The splendid saga of Connor and
his cash has been running like a mad March hare since the spring. It now
seems that the entire affair began as a crazy kind of practical joke,
with a leak to the media that an advertisement was about to be placed in
a rugby magazine by a business consortium which wanted to ''buy'' a
club.
They wanted to create Scotland's first super club with the entirely
laudable aim of keeping the best Scottish players in Scotland.
So far so good. It would appear now that only after the hare was up
and running did Connor become involved. Nevertheless, as spring became
summer and summer turned into autumn, the media was awash with Connor
super-club stories.
The field was narrowed down to Watsonians and Boroughmuir and the
amount of cash involved was variously reported as somewhere between
#100,000 and #200,000. As the publicity cavalcade rumbled on, there was
not one word of protest that the sum being talked about was wide of the
mark.
Perhaps Connor will feel that he is entitled to be justifiably
aggrieved at the less than ecstatic response in the media to his
largesse. Such a reaction from Connor would be understandable. He has,
after all, and no matter how rich he is, handed over a not insubstantial
wad of notes to Watsonians and, with much less fuss, swelled the coffers
of his neighbourhood club, Currie, to the tune of a further #30,000 or
thereabouts.
Clubs up and down the land must be wishing there were more John
Connors around.
Nevertheless, the inescapable fact is that compared to the hype which
has surrounded the entire affair, the final act was a spectacular
anti-climax, a feeling of having been, in a way, short-changed.
Gavin Hastings, who is referred to as The Main Man by Connor, and who
was instrumental in attracting the cash -- such as it is -- to Myreside,
appeared on TV at the weekend to deny categorically that it was the
intention to create a super-club. However, this does not square with
statements from Connor that over the summer they had tried to lure Sean
Fitzpatrick, Andrew Mehrtens and, even, Jonah Lomu to Myreside. With
recruits of that calibre, Watsonians would have sounded very much like a
super-club to me.
Hastings, through his new commercial vehicle, will now be heavily
involved in spending much of the Connor cash as the already substantial
Watsonians' marketing programme steps up a gear. That old saying about
there being no such thing as bad publicity appeared to be borne out at
Myreside on Saturday with the biggest crowd for a club game that many
can recall.
It was, result notwithstanding, and just as Connor observed
afterwards, a fine advert for the Scottish game. Would that we had more
slices of such fine Saturday afternoon entertainment on offer around the
Scottish club circuit.
However, even that great showman Phineas Taylor Barnum -- he of
three-ring circus fame -- had to acknowldge that you may be able to fool
some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time
but you certainly can't fool all of the people all of the time.
Throughout this thoroughly entertaining Connor saga there has been a
deal of suckering going on. Mainly, the suckers have been us gents in
the Fourth Estate. And nobody is going to lose much sleep over that.

Dundee 1, Hamilton 1
IT does not say a great deal for the quality of First Division fare on
offer at Dens Park on Saturday, to report that an item in Dundee's match
programme earned the accolade of being the afternoon's highlight.
There were pre-game murmurs of disbelief amongst the Dark Blues
supporters when they read their club's managing director Nigel Squire's
comments on Canadian Ron Dixon's ''hands off'' chairmanship from afar.
Dixon paid out an original #700,000 to wrest control of Dundee from
previous chairman, Angus Cook, in January, 1992, then went on to splash
out a further #1.5m on players and ground improvements, including a Dens
Park greyhound track.
But when returns through the turnstiles failed to live up to his
expectations, Dixon warned last year that he would not invest ''another
penny,'' sparking off suggestions that he was ready to sell off his
interest in the club.
However puzzling his continued absence may be, it was Dixon who was
the lucky one on Saturday, as Dundee and Hamilton shared the points and
the drudgery of a 1-1 scoreline which satisfied the visitors more than
their hosts.
Iain Munro's Accies earned their first point of the league campaign
with a display fashioned out of effort rather than talent, a fact
confirmed afterwards by the manager.
The home side's direct approach from the first whistle brought its
deserved reward with a typical George Shaw opportunist goal four minutes
into the game. That served to light the fire under the visitors, and
within another four minutes, the scores were tied.
Big Crawford Baptie won the first of a series of aerial successes over
the home defence, and highly-promising young striker Paul Hartley nipped
in when least expected to finish with a bit of style from 12 yards.
The premature departure of groin-injury victim Roddy Manley after 12
minutes prompted Jim Duffy into positional changes, and from that moment
nothing came easy for the hosts.
Manley's recurring injury places a major question mark over the
ex-Falkirk defender's ability to make it for Wednesday's Coca-Cola Cup
quarter-final home tie against Hearts.

Airdrie 3, Greenock Morton 2.
THE advocates of summer football would have been in their element at
Broadwood Stadium. Bright sunshine and a perfect playing surface
combined to provide ideal conditions for a highly entertaining encounter
between two sides committed to attack.
Patience, subtlety, and the measured build up may have their place on
the international scene, but give a demanding Scottish crowd work rate,
running power, and raw aggression and you wont hear many complaints.
And if the fans can sit back and enjoy in their shirt sleeves so much
the better.
Airdrie's temporary home at Cumbernauld can be an inhospitable place
on a cold, winter afternoon when strong winds which blow through the
open-ended stadium invariably test the players' ball control and passing
skills to the limit.
There were no such problems on Saturday and five goals, and incidents
galore aroused the passions of the 1927 spectators throughout.
They may not see a more enthralling game all season, the excitement
being maintained right to end when Derek Lilley was denied a last minute
equaliser by a post.
Both managers complained afterwards of slack defensive play, but
Airdrie's Alex MacDonald at least had the satisfaction of seeing his
side clinch their first home league win of the season. Morton's Allan
McGraw said: ''My defence was shocking and it was a real comedy of
errors.''
''We will have to take a good look at ourselves and the players will
have to shape up or else.''
McGraw had the consolationof seeing striker Warren Hawke, his #100,000
signing from Berwick Rangers, open his scoring account. His goals after
15 and 77 minutes were taken with composure, and proved he could become
an outstanding buy.
Airdrie secured the points thanks to a double from Jim McIntyre and a
bizarre own goal. McIntyre opened the scoring after seven minutes, then
regained the lead for the Diamonds after 41 minutes. The home side went
3-1 ahead just before the interval when Alan Mahood's clearance
rebounded from keeper David Wylie chest and sailed high into the net.It
was a cruel blow to Wylie who had been in outstanding form
MacDonald reflected on the many missed chances, but conceded that a
marvellous display by the Morton keeper had prevented a more emphatic
win.
''We are making it difficult for ourselves because of defensive
mistakes,'' he said. ''This is something we must iron out before our
Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final tie at home to Partick on Wednesday.''
* GIANLUCA Vialli scored his third goal in two matches to send
champions Juventus clear at the top of serie A with a 1-0 win over
Vicenza yesterday.
The striker found the net after 21 minutes to maintain Juventus' 100%
start to the season and put them two points clear of rivals Lazio, who
drew at Bari.

Gala 28, Stirling County 22
HAVING skipped off for the long vac, this was the first game I had
seen since Scotland played New Zealand in the World Cup.
In the last five minutes, when Stirling County battered on the Gala
door, the home defence stood tall and the crowd howled at the referee --
it was really quite good to be back.
So, the champions have lost three games out of four and the Maroons
were recording their first win -- this is indeed a pulsating new
championship we have on our hands.
Gala coach Peter Dods still does not like it: ''There should be 12
teams in the top division. We are playing so many games there are bound
to be injuries which will affect the international squad.''
And his Stirling equivalant, Brian Edwards, does not like anybody too
much at the moment: ''Definitely no comment.'' I thought it was a grand
game myself.
Kevin McKenzie, the visiting skipper, was honest enough to concede
that the champions had contributed mightily to their own demise. Giving
away penalties for back-chatting the ref is for the primary school
league.
''Yet we are not playing all that badly. We scrummed them off the park
out there but just did not make use of the ball we got.'' Those are
shrewd observations.
Not a lot is happening for Stirling in the midfield.
They have problems at scrum-half which ripple out to the rest of the
back division. Even Logan K (The Herald) is affected -- he lives on
rations that would not feed a Ruandan, then tries too hard when he has a
fleeting chance.
It was our Ken who set up the sole Stirling try and he also saved one
with a smother tackle on Dave Boland.
But he is not the happy chappie Scotland knows and needs.
There must be some temptation to play Logan at full back, just to
bring him into the game a bit more.
The international selectors might not frown at such an experiment.
Stirling cannot afford to stay in the rut too long; they could start to
break the mould by reducing the number of penalties they concede.
Gala have a good spirit in the side which could prove their lifeline.
They also have invested wisely in South African Mathys Stolz and New
Zealander Mark Stumbles.
''Frankly,'' declared Dods, ''these are the guys who might keep us in
the Premier division.'' John Amos was the outstanding forward, Tom Weir
not far behind, while David Changleng at fly-half had a most rewarding
afternoon.
Gala should have had a try in the third minute. Boland broke clear,
had two men at his side, but sorrily surrended to Logan's tackle. Ten
minutes later the scrum-half made amends, setting up a score for winger
Mark Moncrieff.
Mark McKenzie landed a penalty to open the visiting account and, after
Logan had come scything into the line, Malcolm Norval surged over for a
fine Stirling try. McKenzie converted that before adding a dropped goal.
Gala bounded back. Dave Changleng, despite a cut head, kicked a
penalty, scored a try, and kicked the goal all on the stroke of
half-time. His touchdown came after full-back Craig Sangster had spilled
a kick and Stumbles had hacked on.
Mark McKenzie landed two penalties after the re-start but a try by
Scott Paterson rocked the title-holders. Big Stoltz played a major role
in the build-up.
Two more Changleng penalties added salt to the sore and though Mark
McKenzie claimed one back, Stirling were denied further reward.
''The phones will be red hot on the last day of this competition,''
predicted Dods, ''and relegation will be on points differential.''
Is that such a bad thing, I pondered?
Gala -- M Changleng; M Moncrieff, M Stumbles, B A J Swan, S Paterson;

Clydebank 1, Dundee United 2
FOR a melodramatic finale at Kilbowie, there was the kind of opera
that is not over until the fat lady sings. Filling the role was referee
Martin Clark, at the end of an unhappy afternoon for him.
An irate home crowd indicated that if they had their way, they would
make him a soprano. They were irked enough by how he had allowed the
game to last for five minutes more by the stadium clock. In musical
comedy terms, the show was not ended until the ref whistled his own
tune.
Truth to tell, it was hard to recall how so many wasted seconds might
have accumulated. Dundee United took the extra five on the clock most
profitably. After Billy McKinlay went down in the penalty area, he arose
to score an efficient winner from the spot.
Clark allowed play to continue for two more minutes, which was a
sensible decision from his point, although it did not diminish the
opinion of Clydebank's connections that he was operating in his own time
zone.
What the Bankies believe, however, is not an open book. Brian Wright,
the manager, put a vow of silence on himself and the players. Three of
them had already done their talking on the park.
Ken Eadie and David Nicholls expressed their views about the late,
late penalty and were booked. Presumably, they contended that the
presence of Nicholls in the vicinity of McKinlay was unconnected with
why he went down, rather than that they had been playing with their eyes
on the clock.
Colin Sutherland had been cautioned earlier about his tongue.
He and Nicholls had steady performances in a Kilbowie squad whose joy
is to attack. Their headed goal, by James Grady, from a corner kick
equalised the stirring opener by Jim Bett.
United made heavy weather of their edgy victory. A team who have
Maurice Malpas along with Bett, and McKinlay might have been expected to
know more answers than the Bankies had questions to ask.
Yet when the quality of the game ebbed in the second half, United's
contribution went with it. They may be more a team built to prosper in
the premier division than to win promotion to it. Sometimes they looked
like a boxer who has to hold a lesser opponent up in order to hit him.
Andy McLaren had a mesmerising first half, dodging double marking at
will. It was hard to see how Clydebank might contain him, except by
another defender. Probably, though, McLaren would have bamboozled any
three.

St Johnstone 4, Dumbarton 1
ST JOHNSTONE had not scored a league goal at home so far this season,
but made up for the shortage on Saturday against luckless Dumbarton.
It was the kind of occasion that had Perth manager Paul Sturrock
shaking his head and declaring that ''it's a funny old game.''
Someone, somewhere, may just have said this before, but Sturrock gave
it fresh meaning by pointing to Saints' last three results, which
included a 2-0 home defeat from Morton followed by a 3-0 away win
against Hamilton and then going down in the Challenge Cup in midweek at
Clydebank by the same scoreline.
Sturrock said he wasn't taking too much from the victory over
Dumbarton. He is looking urgently for some kind of consistency. There
was praise for the return of former Hearts and Hamilton central
defender, Jim Weir, after an injury absence since March.
Sturrock announced afterwards that Weir was the club's new skipper and
had pressed him into service because of suspension and injury. ''Jim
Weir is about 80% fit but what a shift he put in,'' he said. It wasn't
until late in the game that Dumbarton penetrated the home defence and
scored a consolation goal through Colin McKinnon.
''We contributed to our own downfall,'' said Dumbarton manager, Jim
Fallon. ''We lost four goals and they were all defensive errors. Thus my
career so far is 10 goals lost.''
He said that he had not ''ranted and raved'' afterwards, but added:
''They will find out from next week's team lines.''
George O'Boyle was the Saint. He scored the first goal in seven
minutes and set up two more. Kevin Twaddle got perhaps the best goal
when he cut in on the inside of marker Paul Martin and crashed a great
left-foot shot past Ian MacFarlane.
It was a long pass from O'Boyle that opened the Sons' defence for
No.3, with Gary Farquhar finishing from 16 yards, and O'Boyle set up
Twaddle for the fourth in 73 minutes. The striker's cross was touched
into his own net by Martin with Saints John O'Neil in close attendance.

Falkirk 0 Rangers 2
HE only played for the last half an hour, yet Paul Gascoigne was the
subject of most of the discussion afterwards.
It seems that the England internationalist is destined to dominate the
Rangers season when he plays, and even when he is on the bench awaiting
the call.
The fact that he did not start the game at Brockville caused much
chattering and debate among the travelling band of Ibrox sympathisers,
but it was what he did when he came on the field that had them animated
on the way home.
He was good in that late stint, strolling around with the arrogant,
self-confidence that marks the extra-special player, spraying passes
with either foot, side-of-the-foot flicks, chips over defenders' heads,
and cheeky back-heels -- in fact most of what is available in his
natural repertoire.
Whether he will be able to do this at pace for 90 minutes at higher
level again will not be answered until he achieves proper match fitness.
The problem for Rangers is that Gascoigne has become the main man on
the park. Everything is fed through the Englishman, and already his
colleagues accept that he is the team's general, seeking him out with
every midfield area pass, moving aside to let him take the ball and
acknowledging his authority at set pieces.
This is fine and will be beneficial if the ex-Lazio player achieves
the stamina required for the stresses of the Scottish season, not to
mention European cut and thrust, but until that is established, the jury
must stay out.
Gascoigne is certainly popular within and without the dressing room.
Young Charlie Miller, who might have had good reason to resent his
arrival, is in no doubt about his value to the team. ''He is probably
the best player in Scotland already, along with Brian Laudrup, but there
is a lot more to come from him when gets fully fit.
''I expected him to be big-headed, but he is not like that at all. He
fits in well and is a great joker. He has been good to me, helping me a
lot, and he wants to see me do my best.
''I knew it would be harder for me to keep a place in the team, but
the gaffer has said that as long as I play well, he won't drop me.''
Miller has encouraging words for other youngsters at Ibrox who might
feel that there is not much prospect of making it into the top side.
''If you are good enough, you will get your chance, but you have got to
take it when it comes. There are a couple on the verge just now, Brian
McGinty and Steve Boyack, who will come through soon.''
Steve Kirk, the Falkirk midfield player who has come up against most
of the best players in the premier division in the last decade, was
impressed by Gascoigne as well as the other Ibrox import, Oleg Salenko,
scorer of the first goal.
Ironically, he praised the quality of not giving the ball away, the
lack of which earned Rangers much criticism in Romania. ''That is the
difference with these class players. They don't give the ball up.
Gascoigne just strolled through his time on the park, but I also think
Salenko is going to a big star here.''
The Ukrainian who plays for Russia has a faltering gait that suggests
he is permanently off balance, but it is a huge deception because, when
he gets into motion, he is strong, tricky, and determined.
He has a long way to go match the fitness required, but we have seen
enough to suggest he is capable of exciting play. Oleg already has shown
that ''moaning'' edge which is invariably the property of good strikers.
Everybody, but everybody, is to blame bar him. He will do well.
Falkirk, who made a game of it for a while, suffered a tough blow when
defender Neil Oliver was taken off after two minutes. Subsequently, it
was discovered he had a broken leg.
That disrupted John Lambie's plans, but the side battled on gamely
enough until Rangers took the lead when Miller cleverly fed Salenko, who
steered the ball past Tony Parks.
The second goal, 15 minutes from time, was laid on by Alexei
Mikhailichenko for David Robertson, and there was not much Falkkirk
could do about it.
The man who replaced Oliver, Steve Fulton, had to go to hospital, too,
for x-rays on a dislocated shoulder. ''We are not getting much luck,''
said Kirk.
Neither did they get much help from referee Andrew Waddell, whose
decision to award a foul to Rangers after Miller had tripped up Fulton
left them and us bewildered.
Lambie is off this week to England seeking a defender. ''I need one or
two players, but most of all we need a win to get confidence up. Still,
there were one or two good signs today.''
See eternal optimism? It fair warms your heart.

Celtic 1, Motherwell 1
THERE was little doubt during the second half of this game that Celtic
began to feel the effects of their trip to Georgia and their European
Cup-winners' Cup victory there.
This was not surprising either after their travels and travails and
the lack of consideration displayed by the Scottish League over any
possible postponement of the fixture.
Now these players face one more superhuman effort in their Coca-Cola
Cup quarter-final clash with Old Firm rivals Rangers at Celtic Park
tomorrow night. Who would back against them being able to lift
themselves yet again to bring manager Tommy Burns even more satisfaction
than he was displaying after this premier division draw.
Burns admitted: ''This has been my most satisfying week since being
made manager of the club. We started off by winning at Pittodrie against
Aberdeen, continued with an away win under difficult conditions in
Europe, and then came here with tired players to get an important
draw.''
The manager had gone into the game with foreign imports, Pierre van
Hooydonk and Andreas Thom, both of whom were nursing injuries. But he
surprised Motherwell by fielding club skipper Paul McStay for the first
time this season.
He surprised McStay too. The midfielder was a guest of honour at a
supporters' club's fiftieth anniversary party in Greenock on Friday
night when he received a telephone call from Burns.
McStay explained: ''I had played in a reserve game against Aberdeen in
midweek, but I felt that I would require maybe another couple of games
before I was ready to play in the first team.
''I accepted the invitation from the supporters and then at half past
nine on Friday night the manager phoned me to say that I would be
playing. I excused myself from the function and went straight home.
''I had not expected it but, after playing for an hour or so, I would
love to be involved against Rangers on Tuesday. I did not think I would
be ready but I probably will benefit more from playing against
Motherwell than I would from a couple of games in the second team.
''The lads have been playing a tremendous passing game and I just hope
that I fitted in, after being out since the season began.''
McStay went through two operations on the same ankle during the
summer. Now, though, he looks ready to make his contribution to the new,
confident, more purposeful-looking Celtic.
Motherwell, in the meantime, will doubtless be blaming themselves for
not taking advantage of a weakened Celtic team. Certainly, manager Alex
McLeish admitted: ''The last thing we wanted to do was allow Celtic to
get an early goal. I knew after the journey they had been forced to make
that they would tire and we wanted to try to take advantage of that when
it happened later in the game.
''Unfortunately we gave away that early goal and it took some really
liveley work from Andy Roddie when he came on to help us equalise.''
It was a Roddie run which saw the weary Celtic defence give away the
throw-in which led to Motherwell's goal. Rob McKinnon hurled the ball
towards the penalty box, Tomy Coyne headed it on, and Dougie Arnott was
there to score with a low stabbing shot.
Earlier, it had been former Fir Park man Phil O'Donnell who had given
Celtic the lead. Afterwards the midfielder, who has taken time to settle
in with Celtic since last season's transfer, admitted: ''It was good to
get the goal, especially against my old team. Their fans were giving me
a bit of stick so maybe that helped keep them quiet.
''I managed to score just seven goals last season but that is me off
my mark now and I want to do better. There is a real challenge for
places in the team and you have to be playing at your best to stay in
there. That is a challenge I relish, though.
''I think all of the lads began to feel the travel effects more as the
game went on. People have to remember that we spent 18 hours in aircraft
in a four-day spell. When we got back on Friday afternoon the manager
sent us all home to rest. That is what I will be doing tomorrow as well.
We will be ready OK for Tuesday, don't worry about that.''
The only worries which Burns will have won't be over the attitude or
the approach of his players. There must still be lingering doubts over
how they will overcome the punishing programme which was laid out for
them.
There could still be fears over the fitness of the men who were left
out on Saturday. The German, Thom, has been influential in the side so
far this season and Celtic will need him against the Ibrox men. They
will want to have van Hooydonk too and they will have both John Hughes
and Paul McStay.
Hughes was suspended at the weekend after having been red-carded
against Aberdeen. Now he will return and Burns indicated after the
Motherwell match that McStay is very much in his thoughts after his
comeback.
As for Parkhead's Foreign Legion, Burns said: ''We are hopeful that
both Pierre and Andreas will be ready. They have played well for us and
this is a game where you want all your good players available.''

Raith Rovers 2, Kilmarnock 0
A TALL, burly figure, the stitching in his Kilmarnock top having to
work overtime to withstand pressure from within, approached a programme
seller outside Stark's Park early on Saturday afternoon.
The big guy paid for his match magazine before turning with a large
grin to the vendor and asking: ''Oh, by the way, where can we buy some
goals? We need them.'' With that he disappeared into the throng of
visiting supporters who were heading for the Kirkcaldy ground.
Chances are that he was one of the many in royal blue and white who
found the exits in the away end rather congested after Jason Dair had
scored Raith's second goal seven minutes from the end. Our man still had
not seen the goal he wanted, so he probably went as, no doubt, did his
smile.
These are worrying times, indeed, for the Ayrshire club even this
early in the season as they help Falkirk to prop up the premier division
having failed to gather a point in three attempts.
Manager Alex Totten appears not to have any ready-made solutions. ''I
take full responsibility,'' he said. ''I'm the manager, everything rests
on my shoulders. It's up to me to get it right, and I will.''
Fighting words, indeed, but perhaps Totten should look at the problem
from a different angle, or many different angles for that matter.
He was swift to lavish praise on his central defender Neil Whitworth.
''He won man-of-the-match award and I thought he was outstanding,'' said
the manager. True, the tall Englishman left Stark's Park clutching a
prize, but his award was for the best player in the Kilmarnock team
alone and in that he had very few competitors.
His direct opponent, Ally Graham, had a field day in the air and did
not fare too poorly when the ball was delivered to his feet, so Totten's
''outstanding'' claim as regards his man is rather mystifying at best.
''I've been through it all before,'' said Totten. ''Everywhere I have
been I have done a good job. It is not happening this season so it is up
to me to get it right, simple as that.'' May lady luck go with you,
Alex, but treat her well, you may need her help.
Just after the interval, the home-town relief was audible when Graham,
with time to spare, thumped his team in front from close range, and when
Dair did his bit after 83 minutes, that was it; Raith off the bottom of
the table, while Totten's lot's gloom deepened.
However, if the Kilmarnock leader does not have his worries to seek,
for Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl, the world is a wonderful place, to be
sure. Two successes inside a week -- one in European competition -- it
is no wonder the little Irishman appeared well content with life.
''We finished up comfortable winners,'' he said, pointing out that his
men's superiority was underlined by the fact that Scott Thomson did not
have a save to make.
''You have come a long way for nothing,'' was chanted from the other
end at the Kilmarnock supporters as they headed home. For an ambitious
club such as this it should be hoped that this is a situation which is
short-lived. But will it be?

CAROLE WODDIS looks at this week's theatrics in the world of drama
A WEEK is a long time in politics -- and, it seems, in London theatre
scandals. One week ago, the Guardian published a double-page spread
headed ''The book the Royal Court tried to suppress'' -- excerpts from
freelance journalist Christine Eccles's fly-on-the-wall account of a
year in the life of the Sloane Square theatre, home of new writing and
champion for four decades of the radical and the anti-establishment.
Commissioned by Nick Hern four years ago just at the point when one
era, that of Max Stafford Clark's as artistic director, was about to be
replaced by that of another, Stephen Daldry, the book became contentious
just prior to publication. Daldry threatened the Guardian with
injunctions if they printed it and although they did, the book itself
has been consigned to the scrap-heap of history. Daldry has got his way,
an extraordinary irony for a theatre that prides itself on attacking
censorship.
Hern, the Court's regular publisher of their playscripts -- a
relationship he clearly doesn't wish to forfeit -- has agreed not to
publish the book, Eccles has been paid off with a new commission and the
story itself, according to both publisher and the Court's press office,
is already ''water under the bridge''.
This week's current storm is the sudden announcement that the Donmar
Warehouse in Covent Garden (the venue that staged Simon Donald's The
Life of Stuff when it transferred to London) is facing closure next
spring unless new financial support can be found.
Once part of the RSC's London empire, for the past five years it's
been run commercially, thanks to hefty sponsorship from Carlton TV and
Maybox Theatres, owners of several West End theatres. Director Sam
Mendes is one of the current whiz-kids, touted as a possible successor
to Richard Eyre at the National. But despite, critical and popular
success, an 80% average capacity, and a shrewd eclectic programme that
mixes musicals (Cabaret, Threepenny Opera, Sondheim's Assassins) with
revivals of modern classics the shortfalls have kept on coming.
Carlton and Maybox have now signalled they are no longer willing to
cough up and Mendes must either now look to the London Arts Board
(unlikely) or, like so many others, the Lottery for a bale-out (to buy
the building).
Mendes sounds bitter and a touch naive when he cites the subsidies of
other London theatres (like the Young Vic) and the loss to the
metropolis -- ''does it want another disco or shopping arcade?'' The
argument should have been put a long time ago.
At the other end of town, the Young Vic itself has just been
celebrating 25 years with a party and presentation to its founder, Frank
Dunlop. Dunlop, forever the populist and Edinburgh's Festival director
for eight years, originally opened the Young Vic at the request of Sir
Laurence Olivier, then director of the National Theatre.
On #60,000 and with a team of seven including three actors, Dunlop's
dream for the Young Vic was ''an open university of the arts''.
Twenty five years later, the theatre, in the same ''temporary''
building conceived by Bill Havel, has continued its scatty progress,
almost foundering under David Thacker but still, now run by Tim Supple,
in business.
Dunlop, a spry 66-year-old now living in Ireland, confesses that he
misses ''the politicking'' involved with the Edinburgh Festival ''not at
all, though I do miss Edinburgh the city''.
''It was a fight for its future but once Lothian came back in -- they
were always very good to us -- I knew the future was assured.'' It is,
of course that element of the Festival's funding that is now under
threat because of local government reorganisation.
And with that, bright-eyed and extolling the virtues of his loyal
foot-soldiers (''people think of me as a soloist. But I'm more chairman
of a committee, it's the people you gather around you who make it
work''), the irrepressible showman bounces away to receive the plaque,
to be mounted on the walls of the Young Vic, ''founded by Frank
Dunlop''.

Take any everyday chore, like cooking or cleaning, and subvert it to
offer a new meaning. The result can range from inconsequential to
memorable, as Clare Henry discovers
JOHN SHANKIE'S football coupon, which you can pick up at Glasgow's
Tramway, says ''Big Winners Galore''. Let's hope he's right! He lists
the contenders thus: Black versus White, Bruno v McCall, Oasis v Blur,
Neighbours v Home &amp; Away, Braveheart v Rob Roy -- and Clare Henry v
Tramway. The fight is not quite that clear cut, as you'll see, but I'm
glad to be in the ring.
Dark Lights: New Work From Scotland is the overall title for Tramway's
current rather confusing cross-media season of video, installation,
performance, theatre, and dance. The brochure talks up this mishmash of
offerings as ''a collection of vibrant new works . . . charting new
edges of creativity,'' then gushes, ''Tramway is at a turning point in
its history. Tramway will become a living, breathing art factory (shades
of Andy Warhol's hyperbole?); a daring investment in the future and the
first step on the road to an exciting period of partnerships and bridges
between the visual and the performing arts.'' Wow!
Well, the Prudential judges swallowed it. Tramway is now #5000 better
off, being short-listed for the Pru arts awards with a one in three
chance of the #20,000 jackpot (to be announced on Wednesday) and even
maybe on to the #75,000 final. As good as a pools win, and good luck to
them.
For much as I abhorred some of their recent programme, I'm always
ready to eat my hat. Although I hate art video in general (out of focus,
self-indulgent, and so boring), Stephanie Smith and Edward Stewart have
won me round. I would go so far as to say their brilliant video called
Intercourse is the best I've ever seen. Liverpool's Tate and Paris's
Pompidou obviously agree as they too have shown it. It is certainly not
''modern art which is by con artists for con artists'' as director
Julian Spalding says in his notorious press release for his
''unashamedly populist'' new Gallery of Modern Art.
The video shows two giant mouths, 3m high, projected on to adjacent
corner walls. One set of pursed lips spits towards the other pink fleshy
yawning cavern and the globule of saliva flies in a beautiful slow
motion arabesque across 40ft of screen to hit its mark, landing, like
gunshot, in the waiting orifice. Sexual, intimate, electric, agressive,
beautiful -- whichever -- but not offensive. ''Spitting mad'' is a weird
concept. Despite the stress of working and living together, so far Smith
and Stewart are spitting bodily fluids in lust or love, not hate.
This mutually supportive, interactive ethos was further underlined by
two video pieces called Sustain where Ed is given mouth to mouth by Stef
-- once as a kiss of life under water, then more agressively, love bites
all over his torso. ''Eddy's revenge is in sight in the next video!'' he
jokes. I first saw their work in the CCA's 1994 New Art season where a
multitude of red lipstick kisses drowned their skin, then the
Interpretation video in Linlithgow. After a summer residency at Tramway,
several new films are in the pipeline. I look forward to them.
More video from Jonathan Monk in Brush with Death. He takes the heavy
metal music of American groups Slayer and Napalm Death as inspiration
for two expressionist action paintings: Abyss (cool Pollock-style
splashes of grey and white), and Harmony Corruption (elegant dark silver
frost.) Both were ''created while dancing and air guitaring,'' says the
blurb. ''That's the way paint reacts to sound. I'm just the tool,'' he
protests. A likely story.
While the brutal noise is every parent's familiar nightmare (earplugs
are provided), the paintings -- sophistication personified -- lack heavy
metal's violent cut and thrust. In vain I scrutinised the video of the
actual painting process for angry synchronisation of sound and action.
Are the young getting soft?
Monk has used this music/paint ploy very successfully in France and
Copenhagen and is off to exhibit in Sweden next week (a piece inspired
by the weather conditions for the recent Sweden-England football match).
Meanwhile this bright spark has work in London's Lisson Gallery.
John Sharkie combines his videos of cooking, eating, carpentry, and
bath time with jokey sculpture to give us a glimpse of surreal
domesticity where brushes have seven handles, cheese toasties brown on
the floor, fridges contain stiff frozen shirts and trousers, eggs
congeal, and soup simmers in vast steel cauldrons. Banal or brave?
Decide for yourself.
Shankie worked in heavy engineering for 12 years -- hence the
beautiful giant woks. These steel vessels are the stars of the show,
their hammered surfaces and perfect proportions testimony to Clydeside's
past great industrial skills. His ''new man'' role reversal has however
produced an obsession with chores like cooking and cleaning, which most
women will find odd. Yet at the opening one small boy seemed to
appreciate his internal logic, as the child joined in the spirit of the
event and served us a play-school version of imaginary soup and milk
with imaginary spoons. Convincing? I'm not sure. I remembered when that
sort of conceptualism was called make-believe and, for my kids, formed a
routine part of every pre-school day.
All these artists claim to take familiar actions and offer new
meanings, use events from everyday life and ''subvert'' them -- as the
jargon goes. The results range from inconsequential to memorable.
Turning preconceptions on their head is not necessarily comfortable but
it is essential. I just wish they had taken their remit further.
In the light of recent criticisms, Tramway has taken steps -- not yet
strides -- to provide information for the general public via a
photocopied leaflet which is easy to miss and hard to read. How about
documentary panels on the walls? It works for other galleries and
ensures concise, straightforward, unpretentious explanations.
Additionally, Tramway has started a desperately needed archive corner
where folk can access back-up press cuttings, videos, and catalogues.
Transmission and Art Exposure are the only places in Glasgow where
artists can lay hands on anything to do with contemporary art over the
past decade, but both organisations are low budget. Perhaps Glasgow's
new #8m Gallery of Modern Art in Exchange Square (which goes under the
ugly name of Goma) could provide a proper specialist library for
Glasgow's artists? How about it Mr Spalding? Glasgow is overflowing with
good artists. If you won't buy their work, you could at least collect
their catalogues.

BERNARD Lapasset was re-elected president of the French Federation for
four years today and said he would name France's coach on Tuesday after
talks with Pierre Berbizier.
Berbizier, who took France to third place in last June's World Cup, is
currently in South Africa, and Lapasset said he would talk to him as
soon as he returns on Tuesday.
Lapasset confirmed that fly-half Thierry Lacroix, lock Olivier Roumat
and flanker Laurent Cabannes would be forced to rest for one month when
they returned to France after playing provincial rugby in South Africa.
They will miss France's two Tests against the touring New Zealand All
Blacks in November.
''France will sacrifice three good players but these are the rules
that had been agreed,'' Lapasset said.
He added that the three should have returned to France on time for the
club championship, which resumed last week.

THIS triple bill was so under-promoted that it was a mystery anybody
was there to see it at all, but the small audience on Friday for this
Moving Music Theatre programme (repeated at the Lillian Baylis Theatre,
London tonight) were amply rewarded.
Bill Sweeney's Seeking Wise Salmon sets a Gaelic text by Aonghas
MacNeacail to music precisely right and yet diverse in its sources,
marrying traditional Scots music and jazz. The four-piece who performed
it -- soprano Fiona Rose, clarinettist (and artistic director of Moving
Music Theatre) Ian Stuart, trombonist John Kenny, and Gareth Giles on
synthesiser -- were a ''band'' in the best sense of the word, while
still playing expertly individually. A passage where Kenny's jazzy
trombone was accompanied by synthesised drums, and another where Stuart
and Giles swapped ''traditional'' phrases stick particularly in the
mind.
Sweeney's piece was a far more integrated composition that Ian
Wilson's Trieste Fragments, which opened the evening. Played by Stuart
and narrated by Charlie Roe, it is a treatment of James Joyce's
autobiographical writing about his infatuation with student Amalia
Popper. An accompanied monologue with no real interaction between text
and music, it also lacked any resolution.
Between the two pieces we were treated to a snippet of what Moving
Music Theatre is really about. Dancers Henrietta Hale and Rachel Lopez
de la Nieta and the multi-skilled Stuart performed a few minutes of the
sort of choreography that it is envisaged will complement Sweeney's
work. It was quite breathtaking, with a truly original approach to
combining music and movement. May MMT receive the funding to complete an
exciting experiment.

BRITISH MASTERS
A TEARFUL Sam Torrance set his sights on trying to win back the Ryder
Cup -- again -- after capturing his third title of the season in the
British Masters at Collingtree Park, Northampton, yeterday.
The 42-year-old Scot, who in 1985 emotionally sank the putt which
ended America's 28-year grip on the trophy, warmed up for this week's
Oak Hill clash by grabbing a last-green birdie to beat New Zealand Maori
Michael Campbell.
Torrance's twenty-first Tour success earned him #108,330 and, with
Colin Montgomerie dropping to seventh, the oldest member of Europe's
team now leads their thrilling race for the order-of-merit crown once
more.
''You would think after 24 years (on Tour) that I would have learnt to
control my emotions, but I just can't,'' said Torrance, who was in tears
seconds after having hit a No.3 wood over the lake at the 543-yard last
and two-putting for victory.
''I've not been as happy since my kids were born. Thank God I control
myself when I swing.''
Already the winner of this year's Italian and Irish Opens, Torrance
has never approached any of his previous seven cup appearances in such
confident mood.
He is a betting man, but he said: ''There's no point with the Ryder
Cup -- there's as much pleasure in beating them as winning a million.''
Campbell was one ahead with three to play, but three-putted the
sixteenth and then pulled his drive at the last into the edge of the
water.
Torrance, his own drive safely away by then, was telling himself he
could probably lay up. But Campbell hit a No.3-wood third on to the
green from around 260 yards, forcing Torrance to go for the same shot.
''I had 240 to the flag and I hit my No.3 wood out of my boots,'' said
Torrance. ''I hit a good first putt, but it ran that horrible two feet
past. You know you should hole it, but when you've got it to win you
have to keep your composure.''
He did to complete a 69 and 18-under-par total of 270. Campbell shot
68 for 271, and third was Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez on 273.
Torrance was asked about Tony Jacklin's criticism of Bernard
Gallacher's captaincy in a Sunday newspaper interview.
''I'm not getting into the war between them, but Bernard is probably
the best captain I've played under. He has a great head, he comes and
asks and he speaks to you about everything.''
Montgomerie, who was trying to pip Torrance for the third time in four
weeks, birdied three of the first seven holes and would have gone level
with his fellow Scot if he had made a seven-foot eagle putt on the long
ninth.
It missed, though, and when he bogeyed the tenth and eleventh during
another torrential downpour, his challenge wilted.
He has now fallen nearly #30,000 behind with three counting events to
go and Torrance said: ''If he had beat me again I wouldn't have had a
chance to win the order of merit.
''Monty is a helluva player, you know, and he is going to play well
until the end of the season. With this win I've put myself back in with
a chance to win it.''
Torrance's victory qualifies him for the Johnnie Walker World
Championship in Jamaica in December and next season's World Series in
America.
He also is up to No.17 in the world rankings, the highest he has been.
But Ryder Cup success is foremost in his mind.
There were mixed fortunes for the other three cup men in weekend
action. Mark James finished joint twelfth on 10 under after a 72, but
the two closing 74s which Seve Ballesteros and Howard Clark both shot
dropped them to fifty-third and sixty-second respectively.
Spaniard Domingo Hospital, the playing partner of Torrance and
Campbell, would have finished fifth but for a double blunder.
First he was penalised two shots for his caddie holding an umbrella
over him as he putted on the eleventh, then he was disqualified for
signing for a par 4 on the sixteenth when he actually took 5. It cost
him #27,530.

SUPPING with the devil can have its advantages. But without the love
of a good woman, you'll end up, like Faust, consigned to Hell. At least
that's the ending put forward in the RSC's buoyant revival of Goethe's
Faust, parts 1 &amp; 2.
Seldom produced in this country and only once before in this century
-- Robert David Macdonald's adaptation at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1988
with Simon Callow -- and you can see why. Uneven in texture, epic in
nature, Goethe's Faust makes prodigious demands on performer and
spectator alike. A sprawling brute of a piece (as James Hayes's
modern-dress director cheekily puts it at the beginning, ''a stroll from
Heaven through Earth to Hell''), Howard Brenton's new version takes all
of six hours to run its course.
Directed by Michael Bogdanov in typical swashbuckling style, cramming
in just about every device and fetish known to man, the theatre from
tragedy to farce and back again, and employing a battery of lifts, video
screens, swings and trapezes, a vast array of sexual appliances and
dildos, and even an up-beat, Andrew Lloyd Webberish angelic choir as an
alternative ending to eternal damnation.
But then, that's typical of Brenton's breezily ironical, free-verse
adaptation which with a cast of prodigious agility make Faust's desires
and hubris all too recognisably part of our own world. If there are
longueurs -- part 2 seldom rises to the dramatic or philosophical
heights of part 1 -- the centre is held by the twin, complimentary peaks
of Hugh Quarshie's quizzically amused Mephistopheles and, unforgettably,
Michael Feast as Faust. His is a performance of terrifying emotional
danger and risk -- despairing, lecherous, finally sinking to Howard
Hughes-like megolomania. The journey of a lifetime.

<HEADLINE>A sea change in development for born-again Leith. New vintage for the old port</HEADLINE>

IT IS seven years since The Proclaimers announced sunshine over Leith.
It shines on and the born-again port is basking in its glow.
The pace of the port's well-chronicled transformation from squalid
industrial dereliction to chic European waterfront sees no sign of
abating.
When the tall ships docked in July, visitors could be forgiven for
drawing favourable comparisons with Barcelona or Monte Carlo.
Leith sur Mer had finally arrived. The signs are unmistakable: no
sooner is one old whisky warehouse decanted into a series of des res
appartments, than gutting starts on another. Moules marinieres have
displaced the fish supper, and even the old dole office on The Shore is
being transformed into offices and a patisserie.
All the new habitat needed for ultimate contemporary chic was Sir
Terence Conran. Last week it got him.
His design for a #60m international liner terminal marks the next
stage in the port's development. This is big-time, serious stuff.
Conran, not known for a pusillanimous approach to any of his projects,
none the less expresses genuine enthusiasm for Leith.
''I have never had a site which I thought was so wonderful. The
outlook across the water is magnificent and it is a thrilling concept to
have these large liners come right up to buildings,'' he told The
Herald.
The fact that, despite scores of trips to Edinburgh, his first view of
Leith was from a helicopter while judging the European City of
Architecture says a lot.
Leith was a major component of the Edinburgh bid. This would have been
as unthinkable 20 years ago as would any pretensions the port had to
aesthetic quality.
Relationships between port and city have always been strained. Leith
was the gallus besom, not averse to showing her knickers, while douce
Edinburgh always kept a condescendingly corsetted distance.
Harbour extensions bankrupted the city in 1833, and the two were
administratively and emotionally separate until amalgamation in 1920.
Leithers say the port has been in decline ever since.
Yuppification of Leith started either 15 or 150 years ago. Its
grandiose mansions, offices and and array of churches, as impressive as
any in the New Town, bear witness to the immense wealth derived from
trade and shipbuilding in the early Victorian era.
Religion provided the social cement to cover the cracks of class
division. A glance at the tombstones in the parish church graveyard
reveals a catalogue of infant deaths among well-off families and also a
young physician at Leith Hospital who died of fever.
The new Leith started from the unlikely setting of an art teacher's
studio on The Shore. Ian Ruthven had the bizarre idea of turning it into
a restaurant. Skippers was born in December 1979.
''Everybody thought I was totally crazy. No-one from Edinburgh would
dream of coming here, but there was a fascination about a fish
restaurant tucked away in a cul-de-sac in Leith,'' he said.
A range of challenges for the young and innovative architects who set
up in its wake followed, like turning the old seamen's mission into the
Malmaison hotel or restoring the vaults in keeping with its medieval
links with the claret trade.
A new campus for Leith Academy also provided an opening for Queen
Margaret College to come to the port.
Now co-owner of the Waterfront wine bar, winner of a string of awards,
Ruthven recalls the initial scepticism: ''When I stood up at the
licensing board for an extension and said it was for the tourist trade,
they all started guffawing.''
Leith also became the mecca for the MacYuppies. Thatcherism took
partial root in oil-rich Aberdeen and in Glasgow, with Scotland's
starkest divisions between poverty and affluence, but its ugliest
manifestation was in Leith.
Conspicuous wealth arrived via the Golf GTI and began to flaunt itself
on the doorstep of abject deprivation. The haunts of the prostitutes,
heroin dealers and ordinary families in the Banana flats became the rich
man's playground. They could blow on a single dinner more than some had
to live on for two weeks.
For Ian Ruthven, there were and still are occasional problems,
particularly when customers insult his staff, which he mostly recruits
from Leith. ''I won't tolerate that sort of behaviour. I recently barred
a millionaire and well-known public figure because he referred to one of
the coloured waitresses as a nigger.''
Reported crime so far this year is 10% down on 1994 figures. Leith has
the same policing problems as other areas, but nothing like its wild
image of former years, according to Superintendent Gordon Munro:
''Clearly we are pleased that reported crime is continuing to fall, but
that's not just through our work but the assistance we get from the
public and local communities with whom we work very closely.''
That feeling is also shared by local MP Malcolm Chisholm. ''I do not
sense a great tension between the old Leith and the new Leith. It was
there 10 years ago, but I don't think it's so strong now. People are not
opposed to the developments in Leith because they bring jobs.''
What remains, however, is poverty and high unemployment. A total of
4466 people are this month registered unemployed at the new Leith
JobCentre, 10% down on last year, which may reflect some success of
local employment initiatives.
Tomorrow will see the first civil servants coming to work at their new
offices in Victoria Quay. A total of 1800 are due to transfer there over
the next few months. Although not new posts, there are opportunities for
spin-offs for the local economy.
The Forth Ports liner terminal, which could be ready within three
years, offers the prospect of 1500 full-time jobs in addition to
construction work.
Terry Smith, of the developers Forth Properties, says the range of
work in the hotel, shops, cinema and associated facilities would suit
local skills.
''We think this will provide real, long-term jobs for the people of
Leith,'' he said. Leith also has little alternative. Without assisted
area status it cannot compete for Government and European funding to
attract industry.
If Forth Ports succeeds in its bid for Tilbury docks, including the
London international liner terminal, there are further opportunities in
bringing up ships and starting cruises from Leith.
Leith is late in the development game, but still has nearly 500 acres
to work with and can avoid some of the more horrendous mistakes made in
London's docklands.
Sir Terence sees them every day from his Design Museum at Bermondsey.
''There is the opportunity to develop Leith sensitively and
intelligently, and it is important that we do so,'' he said.
That means avoiding shoddy design, poor quality materials and
remembering important things like transport links, open spaces, gardens
and walkways which make for a pleasant environment.
Across the Water of Leith, there are already ominous examples of what
to avoid. The Leith Fort council flats are now ringed by 9ft high steel
security fencing, much more menacing than the fort's original defences.
It was erected along with floodlights ostensibly to deter vandalism,
but the abiding impression is that of a ghetto amid new private housing
and up-market tenants at the Cairngorm and Grampian tower blocks.
The fences do not fit in with new Leith's open outlook, conjuring up
images of calming seascape and the watering hole where the prey and
predator come to drink and do no harm to each other.
Being upbeat about Leith has become an industry in itself. That means
rushing visitors past the eyesores that remain and the boarded up shops
in Great Junction Street.
Its new image is fragile. Nightmares can still come back to haunt,
like the forthcoming film of Irvine Welsh's everyday story of Leith
junkie folk, Trainspotting.
The Shiva centre in Henderson Street offers a drop-in and advice
service to the prostitutes working in Leith. The vast majority are from
England or other parts of Edinburgh.
Over the last 18 months, co-ordinator June Taylor and other unpaid
volunteers have helped 400 women, for whom spending #60,000 on a
one-bedroomed flat is not an option.
''Of course the divisions are here for anyone to see. Basically these
lassies are skint. We know we are going to see a lot more of these women
before Christmas because they need the money to buy presents for their
kids,'' she said.
''If you have been working as a prostitute or a rent boy for the last
two years and you asked Sir Terence Conran for a job, you would be
unlikely to get it.
''I am all for investment coming into Leith. I am not slagging it off.
I am just saying that poverty, extreme poverty, still exists here. I
just hope the people who live in Leith get access to some of the
economic worth coming in.''
The danger ahead for Leith is that it may get too big for its boots.
Other areas would have given their eye teeth for the public and private
investment that has come into the port.
Leith's continued Renaissance needs born-again Leithers as well as the
old guard to sustain it.
Conran's long-time mentor and close friend is sculptor Sir Eduardo
Paolozzi.
''I am going to see Eduardo and tell him about what we have planned.
It would be the greatest pleasure for me to have one of his sculptures
at the new terminal,'' he said.
Paolozzi is a Leither, by the way, and the only one so far to leave
his feet in Edinburgh, at the top of Leith Walk.

A STRONG sense of locale characterises this production by the Rowan
Tree Company, which specialises in dramatic presentations of the
storytelling and songs of the Borders, and while its tale of the
Selkirk-born eighteenth-century explorer Mungo Park involves colourful
depictions of his travels through Africa it is always firmly rooted in
references to his home land.
Written and peformed by John Nichol, it is a thoughtful meditation on
Park's life, told through first person direct narration and supplemented
by the songs and music of Ghanian musician Gift Amu Logoste and the
Yarrow-based Hilary Bell. Based on descriptions from Park's celebrated
account of his explorations of the River Niger, Travels Into The
Interior of Africa, Nichol hypothesises a credible internal monologue
which effectively conveys the war between Park's pioneering spirit and
thirst for adventure and knowledge and his longing for herth and home.
Bell represents Park's wife Ailie but only once enters into a dialogue
with Nichol, the company favouring laidback storytelling tradition over
dramatic tensions. This approach, directed by Judy Steel, works
surprisingly well; Nichol's narration, redoutable courage tinged with
morose foreboding, is compelling and the different nature of the worlds
which Park inhabited are vividly evoked through the music.
Bell's sweet, soothing songs contrast with Logoste's pulsating, erotic
rhythms, yet each emanate a distinct allure.

WELL, no real surprises last night as the blistering Italian Giampaolo
Stuani walked off with a fat cheque, a trophy, and a gold medal for his
performance of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto in the finals of the
Scottish International Piano Competition.
It did seem, throughout the concerto, that Stuani tended to want to
run ahead of the orchestra, and perhaps didn't pay quite the attention
he might have to conductor Christopher Seaman.
But by far his was the most stylish pianism of the night -- which we
all expected after his electrifying Stravinsky in the semi-finals that
even had the jury applauding.
And, in a big hall with the Royal SNO pounding away behind him,
Stuani's sound didn't seem quite as massive as it had in the early
rounds in the RSAMD, but he plays with real attack, bite, and flair. He
stands to be offered gigs that will bring him back to Scotland; a must
for music club recitals, I'd have thought.
Of the others, Charles Owen, who took second prize, lived up to the
reputation he carved for himself with his semi-final performance.
Bright, sensitive, naturalistic, and unmannered, his performance of
Beethoven's Fourth Concerto was highly assured and impressive.
Maria Rostotsky produced a more powerful account of Liszt's First
Concerto than her physical stature might have suggested: a full sound,
though not a big one. Her lack of maturity (and quite a lot of mistakes)
showed through -- good enough for third prize however.
American Lori Kaufman's Beethoven was disappointing, far too flexible
to allow any real momentum or continuity in the orchestral
accompaniment. Fourth prize was about right.

THE FABER BOOK OF TREACHERY
Nigel West (ed)
Faber &amp; Faber: #17.50
THIS book starts off by asking what makes a man betray his country.
Strange to say, no answer emerges very clearly from the cases of the 78
individual traitors it examines, each from his own published words.
This is not a reflection on Nigel West's editorial work, which is
excellent, and as comprehensive in coverage as the material allows.
Traitors to all causes, from democracy to Nazism, are included, but they
do not fall into any particular pattern. They seem an almost random
assemblage of individuals driven by a mixture of character, conviction,
and circumstance to extreme courses of action, worthy at any rate of
their compatriots' condemnation.
The sole Scot in the collection can serve to illustrate this. There
appears to be no special reason why Norman Baillie Stewart, of all the
officers ever commissioned in the Seaforth Highlanders, should have
turned traitor. But that was what he did in 1931, when he passed
military secrets to a contact in Germany, at that time still just about
a democratic country. He was court-martialled and jailed.
On his release in 1937 he headed straight for the Third Reich, of
which he became a citizen. During the war he helped William Joyce and
John Amery, both later hanged, to recruit captive British soldiers for a
projected corps of the SS, the Legion of St George.
All three were afterwards arrested, taken back to Britain and tried.
Stewart followed the other pair in pleading that, as naturalised
Germans, they had the right, indeed the duty, to help their new
country's war effort. But his offence was evidently a lesser one, and he
was offered a plea-bargain: if he admitted his guilt, he would be put
away for only five years.
Most people would have jumped at the chance, but he was outraged. It
took a priest to persuade him to choose the lesser evil, for if he had
refused the bargain he would surely have been executed too. After his
release, when he went to live in Ireland, he spent much time and energy
pursuing with writs of libel anyone who stated that he had been
convicted of treason (and technically he was guilty only of violating
the Emergency Defence Regulations).
He was an intelligent man, who wrote a book about his experiences,
partly to explain himself to his children. But his motives remain
obscure. He was clearly afflicted with extreme self-righteousness,
unprepared to see another's point of view or compromise with it,
qualities which usually reflect a lack of imagination. A career in the
Seaforth Highlanders ought, then, to have suited him perfectly well.
It may have been a world out of joint that drove him to his personal
ideology of Catholic Nazism, his oddball's nature providing only the
finishing touch that kept him locked up within his own head. But it
could all so easily, one feels, have been different, and normal.
P G Wodehouse is the most famous case of a slightly other-worldly
figure who happened to get things horribly wrong. West reprints one of
the notorious broadcasts he made from Germany in 1941. He had been
caught by the fall of France the year before and meanwhile interned, in
conditions by no means comfortable though never actually dangerous. Now
he was in the luxurious Hotel Adlon in Berlin, and I am afraid I did get
the feeling that his main aim was to stay there.
At any rate, the text of the broadcast comes across as truly
excruciating. It may have been just possible in 1941 to wax whimsical
about cattle-trucks, but not now. ''The floors of the trucks were full
of holes, through which icy draughts whistled up and curled about our
legs, and other icy draughts whistled down from the roofs and played
about our heads, and we were all men in the middle and late fifties. Yet
nobody seemed to get pneumonia or even develop lumbago. I suppose there
is a special Providence that watches over internees'' -- not a sentiment
that too many other travellers in the trucks survived to record.
Still, the treason that arises through individual delinquency need not
be disturbing at any deeper level. So long as vigilance is maintained,
the individual in question can either be put right or, if all else
fails, snuffed out. Much harder to account for and deal with are
conspiracies against the country.
They are something of a British speciality. West covers 13
nationalities in his survey. Of these, the Americans seem so in love
with themselves that only the tiniest minority of real deviants have
ever contemplated betraying the rest. That also appears to be true of
the Israelis.
In the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, conspiracy was hardly
possible because of the peril in revealing the least disloyalty to a
second person. France is a different case altogether, with her
traditional, and basically ideological, confusion over what was treason
and what was not. Germany did have conspiracies, but also needed them as
the home of history's worst tyranny.
But Britain -- open, liberal, tolerant Britain -- why does Britain
produce sentiments like E M Forster's, that ''if I had the choice
between betraying my friend and betraying my country, I hope to God I
would have the guts to betray my country''? Even more pointed is the
question put by Graham Greene, not about some hypothetical case, but in
writing the foreword to the book by his old friend Kim Philby which
confessed to spying for the Russians: ''Who among us has not committed
treason to something or someone more important than a country?''
It is fair enough to remind us that a country is in certain respects
an abstraction, to which we might be foolish to sacrifice the real ties
we have in life, to family or friends or even to our own selves. But
then Philby performed his treachery not on this personal level, but on a
level yet more abstract than that of a country, on the level of an
ideology which was not only hateful to most whom he betrayed, but which
had by now revealed itself as offering nothing for all the miseries it
inflicted.
One might understand, if not condone, the actions of young men in the
Cambridge of the 1930s who decided that communism was the only way to
save the world. But when that turned out to be patently untrue, was it
really enough to claim that their loyalty to each other ought to
override the interests of all their countrymen outside their own ranks?
It is a strange set of values that can extol intense personal --
sometimes sexual -- ties, and justify itself by reference to the
ultimate goal of history, yet blank out every other possible obligation
in between.
Perhaps it brings us back to extreme self-righteousness, the inability
to see another's point of view or compromise with it. Few traitors ever
seem really happy with their choices, and the true prophylactic against
treachery may simply be normality.

BETTER late than never might characterise Malta's sudden decision to
restore the relics of her defensive heritage.
More than 50 years after her fortifications were last put to the test
during the Second World War, volunteer groups are enthusiastically
rescuing what remains of the huge bulwarks, strongholds and gun
emplacements with the backing of governmental authorities, who rightly
see in the preservation a lucrative source of tourist revenue.
Perhaps the most evocative of these defensive manifestations is a
mainly natural one known as the Victoria Lines. With the ever-increasing
range of artillery, it was decided to construct a ring of fortifications
to keep an enemy as far away as possible from the Grand Harbour. An
ideal site for a strong defensive position was the geographical fault in
the north that spanned the island from Madliena to Bingemma and, in
1875, work began under the British to fortify this ridge. These defences
became known as the Victoria Lines to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of
Queen Victoria.
Today, alas, nowhere is the poor state of these fortifications in
Malta more evident than here. Considerable tracts of the walls have
collapsed while in some places stone quarries have eaten into sections
of the ridge. Undergrowth, new roads and house construction has further
brought about the general deterioration.
But hopefully all this will soon change. Undergrowth is to be removed
and no further building or quarry incursion permitted. It is intended
that a footpath will follow or accompany the lines so introducing an
exceedingly pleasant 12-mile walk from coast to coast giving spectacular
views. Though some of the forts along the way are still part-occupied by
the military, permission to visit them will be easy to obtain.
The walk I recently made at the Bingemma end of the line was stunning
indeed, with wild orchids strewn about the banks of the deep man-made
ditches. In the valleys, British engineers had constructed shallow
masonry bridges to shorten the length of the escarpment and the most
impressive of these is the one at Bingemma which, together with the line
of defences running over hill and dale, gives an uncanny impression of a
miniature Great Wall of China.
Though there are forts, batteries and gun-emplacements spread all over
the island in various stages of decay, mention must be made of just one
which is currently undergoing restoration. This is Fort Rinella,
containing a 100-ton 17.72 inch gun actually on site. It is hoped to
restore this to operating condition which will make Fort Rinella a
paramount attraction.
As yet incomplete is the fitting out as a museum of the underground
Mediterranean command centre of World War Two buried in rock and
concrete beneath Valleta's Barrakka Gardens. Known as the Lascaris War
Rooms, it is one of the most imposing bastions ever built.
Such fortifications are the very stuff of Malta's heritage and their
restoration will give to the island a new and invaluable dimension
additional to its sensational seaside pleasures.

JEAN-Marc Bosman is a Belgian footballer who has been described as
seriously average. He played for one of the lesser teams in fitba-'daft
Liege until he fell out with them because he wanted to move to a French
side. Since then he has played out his time rather than his career in
relative obscurity. But this week Bosman's name will more than likely be
found on the front rather than the back pages of all Europe's
newspapers.
Later this week a little-known German lawyer called Carl Otto Lenz
will present an opinion running to more than 230 typewritten pages about
Mr Bosman's problems in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Mr
Lenz is the court's advocate-general and his findings carry enormous
weight with the judges. If, as expected, they endorse his opinion, the
future of Scottish, British, and all European professional football will
be transformed.
In short it could mean that big international stars like Rangers' Paul
Gascoigne or Brian Laudrup would no longer be counted as clubs' assets.
Instead they could be free to keep their own transfer fees, negotiate
their terms of employment, and become hugely wealthy. More, they might
no longer find themselves on the bench in some games where the foreign
player rule prevents them playing. The combined effect of such changes,
it is feared, would finally put smaller clubs with no white knights or
millionaire supporters out of business.
Most remarkably, the expected ruling promises to send the men in camel
coats and chunky bracelets who run European football in search of -- of
all things -- a copy of the Treaty of Rome. Well, it should at least
give them an unscheduled interest in the changing Europe.
Jean-Marc Bosman's case has many echoes. He played for RFC Liege but
soon became estranged from his management. Rows and disputes followed.
Eventually he tried to move to the French club, Dunkerque, but Liege put
obstacles in his way and cut his wages. He stopped playing and began
litigation -- to the delight of professional footballers throughout
Europe to whom he is a hero, if only off the field.
His case has attracted much publicity in Belgium where the clubs can
be more awkward and adept at law-bending than anywhere in Europe.
Disgusted at his treatment, he took his case to the Belgian courts after
his transfer to Dunkerque fell through. He argued that transfer rules
and the clause which limits the number of foreign players in a side had
unfairly and illegally impeded his career. The Belgian judges sent his
case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
Bosman and his lawyers argued that Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome
guarantees freedom of movement for workers who are, under Maastricht,
citizens of the European Union. And professional footballers, no matter
how well paid and famous, are workers. The ECJ has already ruled in that
respect. Further, it has said that any blanket ban imposed by sporting
organisations on nationals from another EU state is illegal.
Some exceptions were allowed. For example, foreigners were precluded
from appearing for international teams, for obvious reasons, but the
general rule remained. European law-makers fretted that the foreign
player rule could lead to ridiculous extremes if it was dropped
completely. The ultimate would have been a domestic side fielding a team
in which none of the players was a citizen of its country -- rather like
Queen of the South putting up 11 Luxembourgers (which, come to think of
it . . .).
And so a balance had to be struck, and a so-called Gentlemen's
Agreement (a favourite Euro-cop-out) was drawn up between UEFA and the
European Commission to smoothe the transition towards a genuinely free
market in footballers and their freedom of movement. It is that
agreement which now must be refined if Jean-Marc Bosman wins his day in
court. In that event the most talented players would stand to gain
hugely from the single market and freedom to sell their talents anywhere
in the EU -- but at what cost to the game?
The nationality rule is very much a secondary issue. Jean-Marc
Bosman's case will centre on the transfer system. This in turn raises
questions abut European competition law. The European Commission has
argued only that the law must be respected and has been rather vague
about its own interpretation, preferring to say only that there should
be no distortion of fair competition.
And so Europe's footballers and their clubs await the opinion of Mr
Lenz this week. His view will not be final but it should provide a
strong indication of how this case will eventually end. Mr Lenz's
decision is known to form a vast document and it does not take a genius
to figure out that even a European lawyer doesn't need 230-odd pages to
say nothing should change. If he does find for Bosman, as most people
confidently expect, the judges are likely to do the same eventually
because there are very few precedents for an advocate-general's opinion
being reversed by the ECJ's Bench.
No-one really knows precisely how a Bosman victory will affect British
clubs. But there appears to be a real fear that smaller clubs will find
it difficult to sell talented players and thus could stand to lose a
critical source of income. Bigger clubs would no longer be able to
include their superstars who are worth millions as assets in their
balance sheets.
The most likely outcome is that the court will accept that its
findings will cause mayhem for a while in the world of football where
finances are already notoriously risky, not to say crazy, and that a
long period of grace will be allowed during which clubs and players can
get to grips with what the new transfer regime really means.
In that case you can watch this space -- and the lawyers will have a
field day as they frantically become bogged down in midfield.

THE mother of murdered British tourist Gary Colley has welcomed the
conviction of a Florida youth tried three times over the killing.
Mrs Brenda Armitage, who had attended the third of John ''Billy Joe''
Crumitie's trials for the first time, said: ''I'm relieved it's all
over. The last two years have been very hard.''
Crumitie, 18, was finally convicted of shooting 34-year-old Mr Colley
in a bungled robbery after two earlier trials failed to reach a verdict.
He was also convicted of the attempted murder of Mr Colley's fiancee
Margaret Jagger, 37, at a roadside rest stop near Tallahassee on
September 14, 1993. The couple lived in Bradford.
Crumitie, who will be sentenced on October 19, now faces at least 25
years in prison.
Two co-defendants who were allowed to admit lesser charges in exchange
for their testimony have not yet been sentenced.--AP.

Santa Ana
FOUR uneaten chocolate chip cookies could put Kevin Weber behind bars
for life.
Weber, 35, has just been convicted of burglary for breaking into a
restaurant in Santa Ana, California, in May and stealing the snacks. It
was his third felony conviction. Under a new California law, that
carries a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
''People better think twice about what they do out there. It ain't
funny and (law-enforcement officials) are serious about getting us,''
said Weber in a jailhouse interview.
The restaurant's manager said he was stunned by the potential
sentence. ''I think he should pay for what he's done, probably clean up
the freeways or something. But 25 years? I'm surprised. I'm shocked,''
said Muhammad Alkhuder.
Prosecutors say Weber slipped into the restaurant through a rooftop
vent to steal the safe but tripped the burglar alarm. Weber said he was
drunk and did not remember the burglary.--AP.

The lough had only begun to reveal its secrets, and the Mountains of
Mourne, where the National Trust also maintains an area, still beckoned
Doreen Taylor Wilkie finds some of the National Trust's most promising
properties in Northern Ireland.
FOR its centenary, the National Trust is celebrating in its great
houses and gardens as never before, and nowhere has better examples of
great gardens and unusual places than Northern Ireland. To get a taste,
a tour based around Strangford Lough, south of Belfast, is hard to beat.
With nearly two days of freedom, we headed south through Newtonards
where the lough begins. At this end, Strangford Lough is shallow and,
even in summer, gulls and other waterbirds circle tirelessly, or sit on
the sand, and there are nests all round the lough. In winter, the
islands and sandbanks are home to dozens of wintering waders.
To help care for the wildlife on Britain's biggest sea inlet, some 20
miles long, most of the foreshore is covered by the National Trust's
Wildlife Scheme, with bird hides in some places, including Mount
Stewart, our first stop.
This lovely 18th century house lies a mile or two south on the east
side, where the road close beside the lough looks west towards Scrabo
Tower, erected to the memory of Helen, Lady Dufferin, who wrote the
mournful ballad, full of longing, The Irish Emigrant. South of Scrabo,
Castle Espiei has a wildfowl park, where exotic birds and many other
species live in a collection of ponds, patronised too by many local
birds.
Mount Stewart was once the home of Viscount Castlereagh, British
delegate to the Congress of Vienna that settled the boundaries of Europe
after the Great War, at least for the next 20 years or so. From the
Ionic pillars of its great octagonal hall, to the Castlereagh Room with
many reminders of the great man, the 18th century house is very fine and
a must for touring, but we were after the garden and sped through fairly
fast.
They claim Mount Stewart as ''the finest garden in Ireland,'' and in
late spring it deserves that for the Sunken Garden alone, its azaleas
blazing red and yellow. In summer, the place to go first is the Italian
Garden, and the Red Hand of Ulster, picked out in scarlet in the
Shamrock Garden. The Dodo Terrace has an amazing collection of animal
statues, including a dodo, and the lake is beautiful and surrounded by
flowering plants and shrubs.
But most striking of all, is the Temple of the Winds, set high on a
promontory east of the house.
The house itself was built by the first Marquess of Londonderry, and
designed by that 18th century pioneer of neo classical architecture,
James ''Athenian'' Stuart, at a time when everything Grecian was
fashionable.
Many take a day at Castle Ward but, as we were trying to see several
gardens in under two days, we headed south, past Grey Abbey, catching a
first sight of the Mountains of Mourne, as they gradually grew closer,
to Portaferry at the south of Strangford Lough. This small village has
what is almost a ''seaside'' harbour, because twice a day through the
narrows pour 400 million tons of water, as the tide comes in from the
sea.
As part of the Wildlife Scheme for the lough, the Trust now arranges
special boat trips from Portaferry or from Whiterock, further north on
the west side close to the islands where wildlife nests and rests. The
Trust leaflet Wildlife of Strangford Lough is also useful. Boat trips
are led by a warden and we were lucky enough to spot a common seal from
the boat but, in autumn, grey seals give birth to their pups on these
rocks. But first there was Castle Ward, on the west of the narrows.
Castle Ward Estate had been in the Ward family for several generations
before Bernard and Anne Ward, who liked very different styles, puzzled
and argued over plans and designs, and eventually gave the house both a
classic front along the west and a Gothic front to the east. But it
makes a pleasing whole, with lovely views of Strangford. Inside the
house, the same conflicting views continue in intriguing contrasts.
There is an underground passage to a Victorian playground, shop and
restaurant, and reconstituted 19th century laundry. The old 17th century
Castle Ward stands in the yard of the estate's working farm, and several
beautiful lakes lie in the estate grounds. Here too is the Strangford
Lough Wildlife Centre, in a restored barn, designed to show conservation
work on the lough. It is another place that merits a whole day.
But now it was time to leave the lough and take the road to the hotel
at Newcastle, further south. This is no city, like its mainland
namesake, but a seaside town, long famous for summer holidays. The
Slieve Donard is a magnificent turreted redstone hotel, which has made a
successful change from an earlier era, yet kept the best of the past,
with an excellent health spa, good food in the Oak Restaurant, and also
in the Percy French, the sister-inn. The hotel stands close to the
beach, with lots of walking trails nearby and, up early, I had time for
a beach stroll the next morning. Not to be forgotten was the hotel's
view and situation below the Mountains of Mourne, literally where they
sweep down to the sea.
Rowallane stands on the Belfast road north again, a couple of miles
south of Saintfield and a dozen from Belfast. Created by the Rev. John
Moore in the 19th century out of the farmland of North Down, it is now
the headquarters of the National Trust in Northern Ireland. This is a
garden for all seasons, particularly famous for rhododendrons and
azaleas.
In his day, Mr Moore used his walled garden for vegetables, but now it
shelters herbaceous plants and shrubs, with the national collection of
Pentstemmon and wonderful Blue Meconopsis, there are rock gardens and
fiery autumn colour. Even in winter, the garden is lively enough to
bring in interesting birds and is a grand place to stroll and walk . . .
and take some notes.
We had accomplished a good deal in just under two days, and there was
plenty of scope for more. All these gardens, and most others belonging
to the National Trust here, run special Meet the Gardener Walks on
different afternoons, many stretching into October.
For me in particular, as an enthusiastic birder, the lough had only
begun to reveal its secrets, and the Mountains of Mourne, where the
National Trust also maintains an area, still beckoned. Next time, I
would make it a long weekend.

SO now we know, the November Budget will decide whether or not the
Tories are doomed at the next election. We have it from a Cabinet
Minister, Mr William Waldegrave, the Treasury Chief Secretary himself.
Furthermore, he says, if the Tories don't like the Budget, too bad, they
must support it for survival.
We are accustomed to warnings from chief secretaries at this time of
year when they are bearing down on their colleagues to produce spending
cuts over the coming months. But Mr Waldegrave, a candid and
straightforward chap, more academically inclined than political
streetfighter, is being unusually stark.
''I think that the next six months will define the political
battleground and will define whether the Conservatives have a serious
chance at the next election. I think it depends on this Budget
crucially.''
He added on Breakfast With Frost yesterday that cuts will be painful.
''It depends on the will of my colleagues.'' For the second time in a
week the Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine backed him: ''No
spending cuts, no tax cuts.''
Let us just take this through and see where it gets us.
The Tories know full well that tax cuts -- returning to us some of the
additional seven pence in the pound that they have dumped on us -- will
not necessarily win them another election. Without tax reductions they
will certainly lose. Mr Waldegrave seems to be telling us that November
is the Chancellor's last chance to cut both spending and taxation.
There are solemn faces around the Cabinet table. What we are talking
about now is not reductions in the increases in state spending, but
real, deep cuts in the provision of services. This is a very different
prospect. Mr Waldegrave's goal is to reduce to below 40% the state's
requirement from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
About half the Tories in the Commons want such swingeing expenditure
cuts in order to redress the taxation wounds which they believe have
halted the move towards self-reliance. But the other half winces at such
talk. These are the guys and gals responsible for dumping Margaret
Thatcher and they fear the unpopularity that spending cuts bring.
Can the Chancellor (and indeed the Prime Minister) please both halves
in the November Budget? Of course he can if he just wants to tinker with
the problem as the Tories have done ever since they were elected in
1979. But the whole point of the new Majorism is supposed to be bold
and, if necessary, bloody.
If his special Cabinet strategy meeting at Chequers did nothing else,
it espoused the concept of being more radical, more revolutionary even,
than Tony Blair. Naturally, each spending Minister is keen for cuts --
in someone else's department. The late Sir Keith Joseph is possibly the
only Minister actually to volunteer cuts. There are no definite signs
that anything other than the principle of deep cuts has been agreed.
This is the stage in the process that we have reached, with Ministers
still haggling for their budgets in Cabinet Sub-Committee EDX, chaired
by the Chancellor. The final blow falls at a full Cabinet meeting in the
next couple of months. By that stage, only a full-scale, orchestrated
revolt can stay the axe if Mr Major's nerve holds. So come Budget Day,
November 28, they will be judged. We will see if Mr Kenneth Clarke has
merely produced a balancing act which he will undoubtedly define as
''making a prudent start''. If so, the Tories will have dodged the issue
again and will have decided to drift along as before making the best
shift they can.
Suppose it goes the other way -- the cuts are found, big ones,
sufficient to redistribute the GDP in a way that makes the voters blink,
even the ones with negative equity or whose homes have been repossessed?
Mr Heseltine talks about ''responsible'' cuts, but supposing one half
of the Tory MPs thinks that they are irresponsible and lacks the will
that Mr Waldegrave calls for? The Ulster Unionists, who provide the
Government majority, and their new leader Mr David Trimble, have warned
that they will not be so amenable to Mr Major in the future.
This is precisely what Mr Blair is awaiting, this Budget Day
definition of the political battleground over the next six months, this
is the definition which Mr Waldegrave believes will determine whether
the Tories have a ''serious'' chance.
This seems to me to be prudent, unlike the super-candid Mr Paddy
Ashdown who has more or less committed his party to tax rises again. He
also announces that he would only work with Labour in a minority
government situation after the next election. It is what he calls
''being honest'' with the electorate.
I wonder if this will extend on the hustings to a statement that he is
effectively campaigning for Labour? This might be rather tough to
swallow for disenchanted Tories in the South. Perhaps we will hear more
on this delicate issue from the Liberal Democrats here in Glasgow this
week.
We deduce then, that we are approaching a watershed in the political
cycle, one that will either make the next election a foregone
conclusion, or put the Tories back in with a chance of retaining power.
There have been wobbles on both sides over the summer recess, occasioned
by leaks at embarrassing times for Major and Blair. But what the
feel-cynical voters want now is not leaks, but the real thing. Real
politics has been a blur since Thatcher quit the Commons. November 28
should bring it back into sharp focus.
The Budget, if you like, should provide the Tories' new stand, brave
and clear. Then Mr Blair can -- and indeed must -- reveal his own
agenda, likewise brave and clear. In the meantime he can use his party
conference next month to persuade it to prepare for an imminent end to
the phoney war. Ditto, Mr Major.

Francis Shennan looks at an investment scheme which would allow
businesses to bypass the banks when looking for finance
THE biggest new star to appear on the horizon of corporate finance
this year is the Alternative Investment Market. Like any stellar body it
will have an effect on the area of space around it, affecting the orbits
of other movers such as venture capital funders and management buy-out
backers.
What most players want to know is whether it will help to speed up
these orbits, offering new mechanisms and incentives to funders, or
whether it will create the fiscal equivalent of a space warp, distorting
the views of investors and companies.
Among the earliest to decide to boldly go where no man had gone before
was the starship Scottish Enterprise, accompanied by Scottish Financial
Enterprise, the private-sector scout ship promoting the country's
finance sector.
They worked closely with the Stock Exchange on AIM, seeing the
potential both for Scottish companies seeking finance and for supporting
professional partnerships.
Russel Griggs, Director of Business Development at Scottish
Enterprise, sees the importance of AIM as the supply of capital to
business. ''Around the world one of the things young and growing
businesses have is alternative ways of raising finance,'' he said.
''All we have had really is the stock market. The reason we got into
AIM early on was that we felt we had a lot to gain in the
entrepreneurial field and our business birth-rate strategy.''
Scotland potentially has more candidates for a market where finance
can be raised with little danger of losing control. Eighty per cent of
Scottish companies are family-owned compared to a UK average of 67%. AIM
has no minimum percentage of shares which have to be traded.
More businesses actually grow through borrowing than through selling
shares or a stake in the business, according to Martin Hughes, Manager
of Stock Exchange Initiatives at Scottish Enterprise. He says 40% fund
growth through the banks and 51% fund growth themselves.
''Up until this point, access to the official Stock Exchange or USM
was not really an option,'' he said. ''The only way was through the
banks.''
The other great hope for the AIM is to bring a regional focus, linking
investors and the companies they invest in, an almost roseate view of
the early days of limited liability capitalism. The focus would also be
firmly on the individual investor.
''If you have #50m of institutional money to invest you will not be
looking at a small-capitalisation market,'' said Hughes.
The AIM will only work if the cost of joining it is not a barrier and
the price breakthrough seems to have been made through a teaming up of
London stockbrokers Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley and Neill Clerk Capital,
formed from the financial services arm of a Scottish law firm and London
corporate financiers.
They promise to take companies to the market for #49,500 plus VAT
which will include the cost of brokers, accountants, registrars,
printers and even public relations.
There are, however, those who remain unconvinced. Mike Pacitti,
director of 3i in Edinburgh, still thinks the cost of raising funds this
way is higher, and the process slower, than through venture capital.
He sees the AIM being of interest to technology companies but not the
majority of private companies. They, he believes, will ''see it as
involving the need to disclose information they are not obliged to in
the private arena, even if they have a venture capitalist on board.''
Pacitti is not alone in his caution. Graham Watson of Touche Ross
Corporate Finance applauds the objects of the new market. ''My own view
is that the principle behind AIM is sound and that the Stock Exchange is
right in seeking to play its full part in stimulating economic growth
and job creation by ensuring that its markets are accessible to a wide
range of companies.''
Achieving that principle might not be so easy. ''At first glance it
would appear that the market has been constructed in such a way as to
meet many of the objectives of companies, investors and regulators.
However, on closer examination, it is clear that satisfying fully all
three audiences is an ideal that is unlikely to be attained in
practice.''
The high hopes of a special role for Scotland, he believes, are
equally likely to be dashed. ''History shows that the Scottish financial
community is not particularly good at supporting home-grown talent and
the reality of AIM is that Scotland has no 'special' role to play in the
development of the new market.''
He added: ''On the face of it, prospective market entrants would be
attracted to AIM to raise capital to fund further growth, to determine
the market value of the business or to enhance visibility and profile.
''However in practice, the seductive nature of this pitch might be
found wanting. There are numerous war stories of companies which have
found that flotation was not all it was cracked up to be. The glare and
consequences of public life will be no different under AIM.
''Companies will find AIM attractive only if they can raise money at a
lower overall cost than through more established channels.
Unfortunately, in my view, this is where the reality of AIM falls some
way short of the promise.''
Though he has doubts about AIM fulfilling all the promises that are
being made for it, he is bullish about the venture capital market in
Scotland. Funding is not the problem, he says, it is the shortage of
deals to put the money into.
''Funding corprorate development in Scotland is not at present a
problem for the right company, regardless of its size or maturity.
Venture, capitals, 'business angel' funding, grant aid and bank debt,
some of it subsidised, are all available in ample sufficiency at the
present ime.
''Prospective funders are competitive for the right deal. The problem
is that quality deals are thin on the ground. In reality, AIM will be
competing with an already well developed funding market and it would be
naive to imagine that AIM is going to fill the funding gap which
Scottish Enterprise's business birth-rate strategy is designed to
attack.''
The focus of the AIM might well shift further away from its original
intentions as it develops. One of its nearest equivalents, the NASDAQ in
the United States, over time become populated with a wide range of
companies which take in Apple and Microsoft. However many of those
companies have grown with the market.
Having such companies on the same market need not bar the continuing
introduction of new, fast-growth companies but it may switch the
attention of investors.
It is also uncertain if the individual investors to whom the new
market is looking to provide the bulk of funding are present in the same
numbers as they are in the US and if they have the same appetite for
this form of equity investment as their US Counterparts.
What would affect the introduction of new companies would be if the
deliberately loose regulatory framework of the market had to be
tightened in the event of failures, especially if lack of due diligence
were to play any part in the process.
Some fear that investors may seek to discount the value of shares in
AIM companies, especially if they are seen as high-risk. Such discounts
are, however, unlikely to be due to the individual company rather than
the fact that they are AIM companies and the discounts would not be
greater than if they were traded in any other way.
Certain shares, such as those of the football clubs expected to come
to the new market, are unlikely to be discounted at all.
AIM will have to take its place alongside a mature, competitive
venture capital market. Whatever position it achieves, it will have to
be earned.

ANVAR KHAN debates whether wearing a ribbon to support a cause is in
fact a fashion rather than compassion accessory
THOSE who sport their politics on their sleeve are a broad pedestrian
cult. A ribbon on the lapel signifies sympathy for a particular charity
or political cause. Wearing a specific colour of ribbon is a tribal way
of illustrating support and allegiance to a section of the vulnerable.
Current ribbons include purple for Bosnia; red for AIDS awareness;
pink for breast cancer awareness (in the US, pink fabric ribbons were
pioneered by Estee Lauder and have come to symbolise the fight against
breast cancer); green for IRA hostage awareness (members of Sinn Fein
pop up on TV wearing them); white for pacifism; and a tartan ribbon for
Scottish cancer. Blue ribbons were worn as a mark of respect at the
funeral of film director Derek Jarman and yellow ribbons have been worn
in America in remembrance of American hostages.
It is now, as never before, enough to show that you are thinking about
an issue, rather than doing anything about it. The crack in the pastry
is, however, that people who don't wear a ribbon in favour of a cause
are not necessarily ignorant. In the face of the ribbon rainbow,
however, they could be construed as such. But convictions held are none
the worse or less valid for being invisible. High visibility caring
isn't necessarily effective.
The process of ''consciousness-raising'' is the political tool of our
time; a hammer with which to drum the heads of the public and media
heavyweights. Raising awareness of various malaise, such as the Zero
Tolerance campaign against domestic violence, highlights the cause,
making it high profile, and ultimately justifies the funding which would
have otherwise been spent on more basic, anonymous help.
In the case of Zero Tolerance the decision to spend monies on
billboards rather than room and board for battered women prevailed.
Encouraging people to wear a ribbon is equivalent to taking out an
advert. But the question remains of whether consciousness-raising does
any practical good.
There is a vanity in wearing a ribbon; a showing off of one's
compassion and integrity as a human being. This is not something for
which a fashionable accessory has been made before. The only comparable
lapel, in terms of the quality of an individual, is that of a soldier
after the war, who has been awarded medals for merit and bravery. But
this is an unfair comparison. Medals are the result of achievement,
ribbons the result of peer group political correctness or plain
gullibility.
Peter McGraith of Scottish AIDS Monitor is healthily scathing of the
ribbon phenomenon. ''It's a very useful idea but in a limited way. Some
people enjoy wearing them and identifying with a cause. Others think
they are passe. One of our collegues who was wearing a red ribbon was
asked by a woman in the street if he'd won an Oscar because that's where
she'd seen them. Some people want to be associated with the glamour of
it all. Other people wear them without being aware, not putting a pound
in the jar, not practising safer sex. The tokenism is numbing.''
The ribbon as a flagship idea has no copyright. ''The reason a ribbon
was chosen to represent breast cancer awareness was that it could be
made by people easily, so they could make one themselves, and pink is
feminine,'' explains Isabel Campbell, fundraising manager for Breast
Cancer Care.
''If there was any problem with someone wanting to use it
commercially, the charities would all band together and the National
AIDS Trust would deal with it,'' said a spokesman for Red Ribbon
International.
Waverley Care Trust, however, took the unusual step of patenting their
tartan ribbon as it is of an original design and has now become part of
their logo. ''People seek them out because they like the tartan,'' said
Sheilagh Tennant, a spokeswoman for the trust. ''They symbolise sympathy
with cancer and with Scotland.''
Ribbons have to be user-friendly. The more attractive they are, the
more attention, and therefore wearers, they will receive. Is the ribbon
itself, therefore, deserving of the credit of genuine concern?
Nick Debbs is executive director of Visual AIDS, a group of artists in
New York dedicated to promoting AIDS awareness. It was his collegue,
Frank Moore, who came up with the world-beating idea of wearing a single
ribbon in collective sympathy.
''A lot of people in America feel that the huge amounts of money
donated to AIDS research has been wasted. Frank started making ribbons
in 1990-91. We never used them for fundraising; the idea was that they
would be free. Better to make a symbol of compassion for AIDS victims
simple and evocative, than be used for AIDS fundraising which the
American public are wary of.
''There's a reaction against the Hollywood thing, people saying it's
just chic, but at least they are still talking about the issue. People
who are not going to do anything won't do anything to help anyway, but
at least there is still the potential to act.''
Identifying with a cause is most fashionable among youth and the
chattering classes. The former is due to a student activism, a sense of
teenage outrage, and the latter because political affiliation is
desirable and most importantly, allowed within the confines of the job.
Alignment to a humanitarian cause makes a person seem more sensitive.
In the arts and music industry, sensitivity equals brilliance. The more
eccentric and damaged a person might be the more human they are, and
celebrated political values are those which support the underdog. It has
to be said, however, that in a damning indictment of the ribbon as
blatant exhibitionism, as a mere fashion accessory, wearers are now
turning to a discreet enamel pin. If it's the wearing, not the design
that counts, why change?
''I wore an AIDS ribbon because the disease was in need of money and
to be free from prejudice,'' a collegue told me. How many charities can
say, for real, that their corporate ribbons sustain a fixed and
homogenous concern?

MOTORISTS living in more remote areas of Scotland are losing out in
the petrol price war, a Scottish Consumer Council survey published today
warns.
Extra costs can amount to as much as 13p per litre for people in
outlying areas said SCC chairman Deirdre Hutton. Ms Hutton added:
''Often people in rural areas do not have the choice of public
transport, so they have to pay higher prices.
''The present petrol price war may benefit some consumers in
Scotland,'' she continued. ''However, this survey confirms what many
rural consumers have been telling us for some time.''
The survey was carried out in June by SCC consumer network volunteers
as part of an ongoing study of rural areas. In all, 49 areas were
surveyed across Scotland.
Rural consumers often have little or no choice but to own a car and
use it on a regular basis, the survey claimed, adding that recent
publicity given to the reduction of prices by some of the largest petrol
retailers made the findings more significant.
Ms Hutton said: ''It seems that consumers in Central Scotland are
benefiting from cheaper petrol prices at supermarket chains and some
selected filling stations. However, these benefits rarely extend to the
remoter parts of Scotland.''
The 13p price differential for a litre of four-star petrol was
calculated upon the lowest prices -- 56.9p (unleaded 51.9p) -- found in
Bearsden, and the highest -- 69.9p (unleaded 64.9p) -- found on Islay.
The survey also found that few rural motorists made use of their
nearest filling station. The majority preferred to travel to alternative
stations where they could buy cheaper fuel.
Many reported that they made planned shopping trips to towns and
supermarkets. In the long run, the survey suggested, this further
disadvantaged those who could not afford to travel long distances.
The SCC emphasised that the consumer principles of access and choice
could not always be applied to Scotland's rural population, where
competition and its benefit rarely existed.
The report's authors further warned: ''While we recognise the need to
have an effective and sustainable transport system, we remain concerned
over the impact that increased fuel prices and duty have.''

A SURGE of interest in structural steel specialist Severfield-Reeve is
on the cards as the share classification moves from the building
materials and merchants sector, which is under a major cloud at present,
to engineering.
The metal bashers now enjoy a market status at an all-time high and a
rating twice that of the building materials suppliers, with a
prospective 1996 average price earnings ratio of 17.
The company is now completing a #6m contract in Livingstone for NEC
and is in the middle of a #2.7m order from Sir Robert McAlpine for a
semi-conductor plant for Shin-Etsu. Other contracts in Scotland include
a retail park in Edinburgh with Morrison Construction and industrial
units at Coatbridge for ERDC Construction.
In the first six months, pre-tax profits almost doubled to #891,000 on
turnover 48% greater at #19.3m.
Thirsk, North Yorkshire, based Severfield is the industry leader in a
very fragmented sector. It has achieved very substantial increases in
productivity from its mere 200 workforce with sales per head in the half
year of #101,000.
Profits for the full year are expected by analysts to jump from
#722,000 to about #1.8m -- although that seems conservative -- and to
#2.3m next year where the shares at 92p would be selling at just over
eight times earnings -- or half the average for the engineering sector.

YOUR local government correspondent's report in some editions of The
Herald on September 14 highlighted the clear views expressed at last
Wednesday's meeting of Strathclyde Regional Council about our grave
concerns on the transfer of water and sewerage services to the new water
quangos. However, the headline to the report implying that the council
backs Tommy Sheridan is not accurate.
To put the record straight, the motion passed overwhelmingly by the
regional council, with full backing of the Labour Group, the Liberal
Democrat Group, and the SNP Group, was as follows:--
''The regional council reaffirms its opposition to the removal of
water and sewerage services from local government democratic control;
confirms its concern at the growth of the 'quango culture', its secrecy,
and lack of accountability; calls upon the Secretary of State to listen
to the voice of the Scottish people who wish to see the return of public
services to public control with public accountability to democratically
elected members; expects, in the meantime, that water authorities adopt
procedures which are consistent with the Local Government (Access to
Information) Act; and instructs the Chief Executive to convey the
council's views to these authorities and to the Secretary of State for
Scotland.''
I can assure your readers that this council -- in its last months of
existence -- will be applying every lawful power that it has to hasten
the day when water and sewerage services will be returned to democratic
control, an event which will, I am certain, be welcomed by the vast
majority of the people in not only Strathclyde, but in Scotland.
The Strathclyde water referendum showed resoundingly that 97% of the
region do not want the removal of water services from local council
control.

Chair, Finance Committee, Strathclyde Regional Council,

<HEADLINE>MP warns NHS is facing 'thin end of the wedge'. Private patients 'earn trusts #2.5m'</HEADLINE>

PRIVATE patients boosted the takings of Scottish hospital trusts by
#2.5m last year, according to a survey released by Labour MP Brian
Donohoe.
The figures show a substantial increase on the previous year's total
of #1.7m and Mr Donohoe warned they could be ''the thin end of the wedge
of privatisation''.
''The amounts of revenue raised through private treatment and offering
amenity beds within the NHS is minimal,'' said the MP for Cunninghame
South. ''But the principle of private treatment is too important to
leave to individual trusts to set their own policies in isolation.''
Mr Donohoe said there were major differences in the types of private
service offered by hospitals.
''Some are offering private treatment only to overseas nationals and
others are apparently prepared to accept any private patients, including
British nationals.''
Of 39 trusts surveyed, figures show Edinburgh Royal Infirmary NHS
Trust topped the table, earning #813,946 from the private treatment of
patients in 1994/95. Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust generated
#645,000 and the Western General Hospitals NHS Trust in Glasgow brought
in #326,000.
A spokesperson for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary said more than half of
the trust's private income came from in-vitro fertilisation treatment
which was not provided free by Lothian and a number of other health
boards.
''About half of the remainder came from cardiac surgery,'' she added.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said last night: ''NHS trusts'
first responsibility is to meet the commitments to the NHS which are
determined by contracts with health boards and GP fundholders. If,
having met these commitments, they can attract other business then that
is a matter for them.
''Any profits made through private health services will be reinvested
to the benefits of the NHS in Scotland.''

IMI chief executive Gary Allen is looking into the future with the
#130m acquisition on Friday of German building products company
Heimeier. The family controlled company has over 40% of the German
market for thermostatic radiator valves in a country where they are
obligatory even in old houses.
So far it has exported little of its production and so will benefit
from the Birmingham-based company's pan-European distribution for
heating products such as copper pipework.
IMI is financing the deal through a placing of 16 million shares at
298p to raise #47m while gearing after a #104m goodwill write-off will
be around 45%.
Heimeier achieved operating profits of DM61m (#25m).

ENTERPRISE INNS is coming to the market within the next few weeks with
a possible price tag of #50m.
It has developed from a management buy-in led by former accountant Ted
Tuppen which acquired 368 pubs from Bass in 1991 as a result of the
industry majors being forced under the 1989 Beer Orders to reduce their
tied estates.
Subsequent purchases from Allied- Domecq and Whitbread have since
raised the total to 486 pubs at a cost of about #70m although their
current value is now some #84m thanks to further investment in the
properties.
Operating profits are running at #10m annually.
Mr Tuppen said yesterday that Enterprise is clearly focused on leased
and tenanted pubs with some 65% of income coming from selling drink
rather than depending upon rental income. In this way, both Enterprise
and the tenant have a common interest with the individual's
entrepreneurial ability ''sensitively'' supported by a substantial
organisation.
After the flotation, the venture capitalists led by NatWest Markets
will have reduced their combined holdings to perhaps around 30% with the
management team having 5%.
At present the geographic focus of the business is the Midlands and it
is company strategy to concentrate on areas where there is a pub
culture. So the South-west of England and East Anglia are probably ruled
out but Mr Tuppen says that he is interested in moving into Scotland if
the right opportunties arose.
Beer is supplied by all the major national brewers as well as the
appropriate regional operators such as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley and then
sold on to tenants who have a free choice as to which brands they take
in.
The mangement structure is in place to expand the estate eventually to
around 800 pubs.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the days of the #1m spend to acquire an
Edinburgh pub are well and truly gone, independent free-traders D M
Stewart reported yesterday.
During the late 1980s it became local folklore that such sums were
paid out to buy prestige bars such as Bennets Bar and the Athletics
Arms, known locally as the Diggers because of its proximity to a nearby
graveyard.
''That era has now disappeared,'' company joint managing director
David Stewart said, before flying out to the Munich Beer Festival.
A family company, D M Stewart is refurbishing the Blue Blanket in the
city's Canongate, a bar deeply steeped in history. However, its purchase
price is nothing like the aforementioned #1m tag.
Actual cost to acquire the Old Town landmark cannot be revealed for
reasons of commercial confidentiality.
The Blue Blanket will reopen next Spring and meanwhile, two of the
company's other bars, the Guildford Arms and Golden Rule, are preparing
for a two-pub Yorkshire Beer Festival next month.
D M Stewart has operated for generations and its forebear was D &amp; J
Macallum whisky distiller. The company complements its public house
business with farming.

AN unwritten rule for women in my trade is not to belittle or
criticise women's ventures and adventures unnecessarily. After all
there's usually a four-deep queue of men ready and willing to do it for
us (some of them sitting not a million miles from this word processor).
Let me make an advance apology to the sisterhood, then, for wondering if
the journey of thousands of women to Beijing for the Fourth Women's
Conference was really necessary.
Much midnight oil later it contrived to come up with a ''Platform for
Action'' much of which could have been written in advance and probably
was. It called for a range of entirely laudable goals including greater
access to contraception, greater rights for the girl child, a rethink of
the laws on inheritance, condemnation of violence against women and the
need for all women to have the freedom to control their own sexuality.
Well, yes. But how exactly does that differ from what many delegates
have wanted and campaigned for these many years? How much does it
reflect the particular priorities of an essentially Western agenda? And
will the fact that it is enshrined in a ringing end-of-term statement
endorsed by political luminaries of the stature of the Norwegian Prime
Minister, undeniably good thing though she is, make a tuppence worth of
difference back at the policy ranches of overwhelmingly male-dominated
legislatures across the globe?
There is an argument that the very fact of having such an assembly and
attending it is an affirming experience in its own right. An opportunity
to learn at first hand the experience of women from a range of different
cultures, to make friendships however transient, and to bring that fresh
understanding to bear on your own life and times. I'm sure that's right.
I'm less convinced that the best way to do so is to throw a massive
talkfest for representatives of half the world's population.
Women globally have much in common. Not least second-class
citizenship. But they also have much which divides them philosophically.
So that what the Beijing conference also inadvertently underlined was
the entrenched opposition of many Islamic and Catholic women to many of
the main tenets of the final communique.
It's also in the nature of international things that while some women
enjoy sufficient economic independence to have the luxury of pondering
on the quality of their orgasms, others are understandably more
preoccupied by stopping their children starving. Both are valid
preoccupations in their context; but you could see why one might appear
somewhat peripheral to the other's concerns.
I fret too about the level of self delusion engendered by these
massive, and massively hyped gatherings.
One earnest report of the proceedings at the weekend noted that the
European Union countries ''were especially pleased with the elements
which ensure equal inheritance rights, condemn all forms of violence
against women, emphasise the rights of the girl child, and define a
woman's right to control over matters related to her sexuality''. Excuse
me -- did I hear ''ensure''?
How, exactly, ensure? What will ensure these goals are achieved is the
long, unglamorous slog at the political coalface back home. And when
even these self-evidently just aims are rejected by more than 20 of the
women-only delegations who attended you begin to see the measure of the
hill to be climbed.
Some of the delegations hostile to the final document, itself the
product of much backstage compromise, have made it entirely clear that
they will promote nothing which conflicts with the laws of Islam. Which
means they will promote nothing very much from that text.
The essential problem with these enterprises is always the breadth of
the canvas. All the world's women attempting to address all of the
individual and collective concerns can never be a four-day event. Much
more useful I suspect are those international gathering which focus down
on specific causes of concern. It can be useful only if people involved
in health promotion and education, particularly at community level, have
an opportunity to share experiences. Similarly with issues relating to
combating poverty.
Organisations like SEAD, specifically set up to foster first and third
world links, regularly report the success of exchange visits where
communal solutions are found to experiences geographically disparate but
all too similar in terms of tackling human hardships.
There was of course an inbuilt irony in the UN's selection of
destination for its women's conference. Many regimes militate against
the development of women, but few have so ruthlessly pursued fertility
control or so brazenly ignored the crime of female infanticide. Did the
footsteps of many thousands of foreign women trampling over these
prejudices one week in September implant any lasting message on the old
men of the Chinese administration? Or did they, by their presence,
accidentally confer any respectability on a pretty despicable
government?
I realise, even as I write, that I could be guilty as charged of undue
cynicism and overweening pessimism . . . never a very attractive
combination.
But all week I've heard and read snatches of speeches heralding a
bright new emancipated dawn. Every child a wanted child. Every child a
respected, well-nourished child. Every child born equal regardless of
sex (though not regardless of sexual orientation; the conference
couldn't quite bring itself to grasp that nettle). And then the Pope
popped up defending his stance on opposition promotion of condom use in
the battle against Aids.
The answer to Aids is marital fidelity His Holiness pronounced. There
you go, sisters. One minute the heady brew of final rallying calls from
the conference platform. The next an uncompromising dose of unreality
from the Vatican. Welcome home.

TO no-one's surprise, concerning water privatisation this time, the
Tories have imposed their will against that of the Scottish people,
despite the magnitude and cross-section of opposition.
Strathclyde's water referendum reported 97% against privatisation. Now
the latest surreptitious Scottish Office scheme, to open the water
industry to the private sector, is described by a leading investment
bank as misconceived, saying that consumers would have to pay not just
for water but for increased shareholders' dividends.
Lo and behold, the new West of Scotland water quango announces that
water charges are likely to rise by a massive 15% over the next year,
with price hikes likely over the following five years.
This costly quangoisation is propelling a tap tax on Scots who
bitterly resent paying for quangos they don't want.

I WAS pleased to see in your report of the North-east flooding a
timely reminder of the Muckle Spate of 1829. It is, no doubt, little
comfort to farmers in the area that the rainfall leading to the 1829
spate caused exceptional flooding across a much wider area, from the
Nairn to the South Esk at Montrose.
The risk of extreme floods at this time of year in the North-east is
well-established: other major floods have occurred in July/August 1956
and in August 1970. The peak flow on the River Findhorn on that latter
occasion still stands as the highest flow observed on any UK river since
regular monitoring began.
Recent events -- in terms of water shortage and then excess -- are
symptomatic of an increased variability which has occurred in Scottish
river flows over the last five to 10 years. Hydrological monitoring, and
studies into the effects of further climatic shifts in the future, must
surely be more deserving of our national resources than ever before.

THERE is no political leader in Britain with a more onerous task than
Mr Paddy Ashdown. As voting figures show consistently, the country is
well-supplied with Liberal Democrats. Unfortunately they are like
raisins in a meanly constructed fruit pie, scattered widely so that they
lack cohesive bite, taste, or influence. In political terms this is just
another way of saying that Liberal Democrats never see their true
strength fairly represented under present parliamentary dispensations.
There is nothing Paddy Ashdown can do about this. The reform of
Parliament is crucial to the future of his party but is marginal to the
interests of the Tories and Labour. Mr Blair has promised to hold a
referendum on Proportional Representation if a Labour Government is
returned but this would not guarantee reform. Mr Ashdown must make the
best of what he has got, and his task at the annual Liberal Democrat
party conference in Glasgow is to lay out for his party the steps that
they all must take in the increasingly fraught months before the next
General Election.
It is unfair, and always has been, to say that Liberal Democrats do
not have policies. They have plenty of them but have suffered from an
inability which is not entirely of their own making to put these
policies across to the general public. Interestingly, the one Liberal
Democrat policy which is passably familiar to the public at large is the
proposal to increase income tax to provide better education. Even more
interestingly, there is no sign of revulsion at the prospect of higher
taxes for a good cause. It is possible that the same acceptance would be
given to raise taxes a little to provide a National Health Service
worthy of the name. The point of this is, as Lady Williams said
yesterday, that voters are already disillusioned with politics and
politicians and one honest and sensible way to overcome this is to put a
cost on policies wherever possible, and to be frank about how they will
be funded. Interested voters will also be aware that Mr Ashdown has
dealt with the absurdity of ''equidistance'', the policy which placed
his party at an equal remove from both the Tories and Labour. This
policy has been abandoned in the interests of common sense and
pragmatism and replaced with a proper, if unequal, distance from both.
Mr Ashdown will not support another Tory Government and the policy,
overwhelmingly supported by delegates at a pre-conference strategy
session in Glasgow yesterday, is welcome to all those appalled at the
prospect of the lengthy domination of British politics by one party.
Nevertheless, the issue of ''equidistance'' highlights Mr Ashdown's
electoral problems. His party can attract votes from both Tory and
Labour supporters but he has to be careful about how he does this. It is
all very well to lay out a radical stall and to make clear that Tories
are anathema as a partner in Government, but this does not make it easy
to attract votes from disenchanted Tories. The problem is evident in Mr
Ashdown's current distaste with the description of being
left-of-anything. As he sees it, Liberal Democrats may find the Tories
impossible but this does not mean that they will be overly close to
Labour. It may be preferable to the Tories but that is not, in Mr
Ashdown's mind, saying very much. Independence with radical policies is
his aim and it is a perfectly reasonable one. The Liberal Democrats are
a necessary part of Britain's pluralist political life. If they can
retain integrity and independence they will continue to be so, but it
will not be easy.

IN your coverage of the TUC debate on low pay (September 14), you
quote figures from the Low Pay Unit for the ''10 worst-paid jobs in the
country'' -- and say that all but No 10 (kitchen porter) are ''listed as
female occupations''.
Is this yet more special pleading by the women's lobby? I know any
number of barmen (No 4), a few waiters (No 1), and my own flatmate works
part-time as a cleaner/domestic (No 8 -- yes, he's male).
Surely it's time these spurious gender distinctions were abolished?

LORD Lindsay has made a remarkably effective debut as Agricultural
Minister at the Scottish Office. A farmer himself, he knows what he
talks about, has a quick sympathy for the farming community (which has
been identified and welcomed by its members) and knows how to make the
effective demonstration of concern. That was shown last week when he
cancelled a visit to Rhum to make a quick appearance at an emergency
meeting of North-eastern farmers in Keith, a switch which seems to have
been appreciated. He could not promise much specific or immediate state
help to the region which has suffered mightily from excessive rain and
consequent floods, but there seems little doubt about the nature or
direction of the advice he will be tendering to the Secretary of State.
His popular reception will delight Tories who have found their rural
electoral appeal severely undermined by the SNP, and nowhere more so
than in the North-east. That sort of consideration may reinforce a good
case for the Government helping farmers recover from what amounts to a
substantial natural disaster in the region. These things are better
handled in the United States where the criteria for natural disasters
are well established and quickly recognised (and not just for farmers)
and evoke the sort of speedy response which President Clinton has just
made to the sufferings of the American Virgin Islands at the
depredations of the latest hurricane.
Local farmers in the North-east have asked for Aberdeen, Banff, and
Moray to be designated a disaster area, and for various state subsidy
payments to be advanced. Financial calculations of crop losses in these
counties run as high as #30m but that could easily be an under-estimate,
and which will anyhow rise when other aspects of the losses are counted.
These will emerge: after some weeks of intense drought, the region seems
to have received a fifth of its normal annual rainfall within little
more than a week, and although farmers are not the only sufferers, there
are fears that many of them, particularly grain producers, may be put
out of business. Help should be focused on them and delivered with some
despatch. Some observers may affect to believe that farmers are already
a cossetted group, pampered even more than before by the operations of
the Common Agricultural Policy, but the reality is far more complex,
though even well-off farmers can still be very hard hit by unusual
climatological forces, and many small men can easily be forced out of
the industry altogether, a development which some are already
contemplating. Farmers cannot be insulated completely from the vagaries
of the weather, which is something they have to live with, but
exceptional experiences require exceptional responses; and few doubt
that this has been an exceptional summer.
Lord Lindsay's good beginning will be enhanced if he is seen to have
the clout to deliver something at least of what the North-east farmers
(and certainly the local NFU) expect. That is what may jag the Scottish
Office into action; yet in a sense that impulse is irrelevant both to
the extent of farmers' suffering and the degree to which public support
can provide compensation. Yet it would be naive to imagine that
politicians can ever afford to ignore the political consequences of
their work. In this case the conjunction of political self-interest with
those of North-eastern farmers is not to be denied; and the Government
is unlikely to feel guilty about accepting it and loosening the public
purse strings in spite of the Waldegrave-Clarke attempts to draw them
tighter elsewhere.

SCOTTISH companies have been making takeover news as rarely before
with Scottish and Newcastle's acquisition of Courage and ScottishPower's
bid for Manweb. Speculation about further activity has not been far from
the surface either -- will the Royal Bank and the Bank of Scotland go
for one of the English building societies.
Below the top level, however, the situation is less clear cut. ''It's
not that unusual in terms of transactions,'' said David McCorquodale,
head of corporate finance at KPMG. ''These are big transactions but they
are also industry-linked. S&amp;N's performance is linked to their sector,
ScottishPower's to their industry.''
Graeme Bissett, corporate finance partner at Arthur Andersen, agreed:
''These events are all high-profile acquisitions.
''Arguably there are special reasons for ScottishPower/Manweb -- the
post-privatisation shakeout for example, and financial sector
deregulation may account for bank/building society activity. But it is
questionable whether these specific events are really evidence of
something stirring.''
It has, however, been an unusually hot summer in terms of business
activity as well as the weather. ''The top end of the market is getting
quite heated,'' said Iain Tulloch of Murray Johnstone.
Mike Pacitti, director of 3i, said: ''The normal summer lull hasn't
appeared yet.'' His company has been involved in a high level of
management buy-outs and buy-ins during the year, including the
Glasgow-based builders John Dickie Group, the Perth-based Shell
subsidiary CSC Crop Protection, Lithgow Electronics and the merger of
two Scottish electronics manufacturers to form Walker Dickson Group.
He believes Scottish companies have become more acquisitive. ''It's
more satisfying to see companies like S&amp;N doing what they're doing
rather than waiting for a takeover,'' he said. ''A lot of private
companies also realise they can't sit still, that if they don't go
forward they'll end up going backward.''
Funding has become easier. ''There's no shortage of finance -- the
resources are there if companies want to be a bit more ambitious.''
There is also evidence of an increased willingness to raise the
finance from shareholders. ''I'm delighted to see Scottish companies
going out to raise money for acquisitions and approaching their
shareholders for finance,'' said McCorquodale.
In relative terms the Scottish economy has been quite strong, driving
some of this activity. ''Last year saw a series of successful early
stage flotations -- Magnum, Calluna and Memory for example,'' said
Bisset. ''And there is continued strong performance from a number of our
major companies such as Bank of Scotland, Weir Group and Christian
Salvesen.''
Companies are behaving much like their southern counterparts but are
more reticent about publicising it. ''Scottish firms are doing the same
as English firms in the same industry -- it's just that most Scottish
companies tend not to shout about it in case it backfires,'' said
McCorquodale.
They will also usually look for sustainable business growth, making
progress by ''regular injections of entrepreneurial flair'', according
to Bisset.
''The success of many Scottish companies underlines the merits of this
approach. The mega-takeovers look like an outward manifestation of a
confident business community.''
For Iain Tulloch sees it is a return to a healthy Scottish tradition.
''If you look at history, the Scots used to invest 20 times more per
head than the English. We have had a more entrepreneurial outlook than
people down in England.
''What we have had recently is steady growth. It's a good time to
invest.''

AS I write, Aberdeenshire is enjoying its ninth consecutive day of
almost continuous rain. In that long week we have had a fifth of our
annual rainfall. What had been our driest summer and looked, two weeks
ago, like being our best ever harvest, has turned into a disaster.
We are right back to 1887 when Aberdeenshire was the county for sale.
A new race of white settlers can start getting its cheque books ready,
for there will be plenty of farms on the market when this year's harvest
is all in.
And you must not think I'm crying wolf. With 40% of the spring barley
to cut, the maltsters have closed their doors. They will take no more
barley unless it is cut already. And with 95% of wheat still out, most
is already a write-off.
We have had difficult wheat crops before. Two years ago we didn't get
ours until the first week of November. Then we had a reasonable harvest
and the grain was in decent order. So how can we have a disaster on our
hands in the second week of September?
The answer is that the grain is sprouting. That means the energy is
out of the grain and into little roots and stems. In 1993 the crops got
wet and stayed wet, but as long as they remained standing the grains
didn't germinate. For some reason this year, even when it is all
standing perfectly, the grains are germinating like mad.
I've just been to see Mossie's two fields of wheat which he still has
to cut, and I have never seen such a mess. The crop is all standing and
yet every head is sprouting. The worst crop is of Beaver. Each head has
a tangle of roots hanging down like a shaggy white beard.
Where the crop is thick, the little roots are matted together to make
a solid canopy of porridge. On the top of this canopy is a delicate
green tinge as the plants send their first shoots to where the sun would
be if there was any justice. And remember, all this growth is happening
two feet above the ground. It is quite extraordinary.
Everyone is affected differently of course. The Irishman and I will
look back on 1995 as one of our best harvests ever, for we have no wheat
or spring crops. The Red Rooster is down from 200 acres to only 100 of
wheat this year, so he's suffering, while Mossie's down from 250 acres
of wheat to 30, and he's only going to have to write 20 off. Mind you
even that is sore, for it was yielding 81 cwts to the acre.
But what about Big Hamish? He has hardly cut any of his 700 acres. And
Young Ochyoch, Hillie and Mains have all got disasters on their hands.
So is there nothing that can be done? Well, Mossie and the Rooster are
planning. They are going to spray their wheat with roundup to kill the
airborne crop. Mossie's then going to mow it, bale it, treat it with
ammonia and feed it to cattle. ''That way I'll be able to lose even more
money because I'll need to buy some loss-adjusters to eat it,'' he says.
The weather has been a bugbear to Mossie in more ways than one. Having
just paid for a make of combine that starts at #160,000 he is finding it
frustrating looking at it dripping in the field instead of tearing up
and down earning #25 an acre. The salesman might have thought about that
before he phoned up to remind our man gently that he would like a
cheque. That might have saved him a sleepless night or two.
''Oh aye, certainly. I'll just send you a cheque right away. And if
you get it through give me a phone. If they cash yours I'll maybe try
some others.''
And, finally, the Irishman made what everyone else seemed to think was
a very witty remark at the discussion group on Sunday. I wonder if you
agree?
I had been trying the lads with a point of principle. Did they think
we should be boycotting French goods in response to them testing atom
bombs in the South Pacific. Of course, Big Hamish didn't know they were
testing bombs in the Pacific and most of the lads agreed they were
boycotting pretty comprehensively already, as they didn't like anything
French.
I told them about my friend who farms peaches, pears, and apples in
New Zealand. He reckons the French know perfectly well that exploding
atom bombs is dangerous, and that's why they don't explode them in
Paris.
He was very pleased when some of his fellow farmers drove up to French
Bastille day celebrations and emptied their muckspreaders at them.
The Irishman stirred. ''That's it Charlie,'' he said. ''You could put
all these articles you've written for the last five years in a barrow
and dump them outside the French consul's office in Aberdeen. That
should learn them.''

WHO said size doesn't matter? It certainly matters in terms of
investment but, as in other areas of life, it often tends to be a matter
of perspective.
It was a difference of perspective which led to a split, largely on
north-south lines, between venture capital companies in Scotland and
London, over the maximum limit for a qualifying investment by a Venture
Capital Trust in any one company.
London firms tended to favour a #2m limit but the Scots believed
venture capital was already operating successfully at that level and
feared VCTs would concentrate on that area.
The area of greatest need, generally referred to as the funding gap,
exists around #500,000 and under.
Iain Tulloch, director of Glasgow based Murray Johnstone, who was one
of those lobbying hard for the lower limit, argued that taxpayer's money
should not be used effectively as a subsidy in an area where there was
already healthy competition. A healthy #10m-plus company looking for #1m
should have no problem raising finance.
When Venture Capital Trusts were introduced in the 1995 Finance Act,
with the object of encouraging individuals to invest in unquoted
companies, the limit was set at #1m.
Even this might not be low enough to solve the problems at the lower
end of the venture capital market. Mike Pacitti of 3i had hoped VCTs
would focus on this end of the market, up to #500,000.
''The final limit of #1m will mean that this gap will still largely
remain unfilled by others as investments will gravitate to the #1m
level,'' he said.
Tulloch understands the point but added: ''If it had been #500,000,
VCTs would not have been able to raise anything material. The average
investiment will be #750,000. It is difficultto raise money under
#500,000, and very few people will invest as little as #700,000.
''It is going to bring a lot money in the #500,000 to #1m range, but
quite a lot of money in the #500,000 range too.''the area where it is
hardest to raise funds.''
Murray Johnstone is raising the first VCT, to be managed by John
Simpson, which has already passed the minimum subscription level.
Graeme Bissett, corporate finance partner at Arthur Andersen in
Edinburgh, agrees. ''VCTs are publicly accountable and will require full
and thorough diligence on their investees,'' he said.
''The need to invest funds and this requirement for thorough diligence
will naturally push the average investment size into the #500,000 -- #1m
range, thereby missing the perceived funding gap.''
A better solution to the problem, he believes, is the proposed
Scottish Equity Partnership. ''It has much more chance of succeeding in
dealing with the funding gap. It offers a partnership of public and
private-sector funds, managed by people who understand the market
segment being targeted.''
The #25m Partnership, to be half-funded by Scottish Enterprise and
half by UK institutions, would take equity stakes of between #50,000 and
#500,000 in small and medium-sized companies with the investment for the
first time guaranteed by the European Investment Fund, part of the
European Investment Bank.
''The profile of the listed high-growth companies is encouraging
others,'' said Bissett. ''Scotland cannot afford to let these companies
fail through lack of equity. The Scottish Equity Partnership, and to a
lesser extent VCTs, therefore have a critical role to play.''
Meanwhile Scottish Development Finance, Scottish Enterprise's own
venture capital fund, has been putting sums of between #50,000 and
#100,000 into companies since 1982. Its 250 investments now top #50m and
have drawn in another #400m from the private sector.
Director of Business Deveopment at Scottish Enterprise Russel Griggs
said: ''We want to encourage more people to come into this area along
with 3i, Murray Johnstone, Northern Venture Managers and ourselves. The
number dealing in this area has not expanded. Yet we have made money
over the last 13 years in real terms.''
In some areas organisations such as British Coal Enterprise and
British Steel (Industry), which have a brief to help create jobs in the
area where those industries operated, are additional sources of
investment.
''There will still be a problem for companies raising between #50,000
and #150,000 of equity,'' said John Fairlie, regional manager of BS(I).
''You don't have the same choice at this level.''

SOME weeks ago on the farming page we used a cartoon which depicted
two farmers leaning over a dyke in the middle of a shower of rain. The
caption quoted one of the pair as saying:'' It's come three weeks too
soon. I hadn't finished complaining about the drought.''
It seemed quite funny at the time but, in the light of events in the
North-East of Scotland it doesn't seem so funny now.
Last week, with the equivalent of one month's rainfall falling over a
short period, demonstrated the risks which always lurk round the corner
for farmers. After a record breaking summer everything seemed set for a
bumper harvest.
The drought ended dramatically with 11 days of non-stop monsoon
weather and suddenly there was talk of losses of #30m.
Those of us living in the southern half of the country forget that
things run a bit later in the north. It is estimated that in the
Grampian area 80% of the wheat, 25% of the spring barley, 90% of oats,
and 75% of spring oilseed rape was still to be harvested.
Even in the Central Belt much of the baled straw which was a beautiful
golden colour a few weeks ago is quickly developing a grey sheen.
On top of that, many farmers are already admitting that with the
drought inhibiting grass growth they do not have enough forage to see
them through the winter. Potato growers are anxiously waiting to see
what problems may stem from secondary growth induced by the ending of
the drought. It is often said that farmers are never pleased, but what
suits one sector is almost bound to be bad news for another.
The one thing that we should perhaps be grateful for is that we have
no control over the weather. Look at the problems caused by
interventionist mechanisms such as set-aside and quotas. These would be
as nothing beside the heat that could be generated with disputes over a
European Directive on Frequency of Artificial Rainfall Targeting. Just
think of the acronym -- so much more evocative than SAP or BSP.
The one ray of sunshine we can point out to the sodden farmers in
Banffshire is that they should expect very little trouble next year from
soil-borne pathogens. A conference on integrated crop protection at
Heriot-Watt University was told that flooding has been shown to provide
highly effective control of the aforesaid soil-borne pathogens. I am
sure that will be a great comfort around Keith and Huntly. However, when
much of the west of Scotland was under several feet of water at the
beginning of this year there were warnings about all the nasty possible
side effects farmers should look out for -- sewage and chemical
pollution. I think we should risk a few pathogens.
It is unfair to poke fun at the conference for many of the papers made
interesting reading. It is reassuring to think that serious scientific
endeavour is going into ways of controlling pests and weeds without
resorting to chemical ''nasties''. So we read how tiny parasitic worms
can be used to kill slugs which attack winter wheat, oilseed rape, and
maincrop potatoes. Plants such as clovers may be used to suppress weeds.
I have unwittingly been using that technique in my own garden where
chickweed will, henceforth, be designated an undersown intercrop.
Clover also features in a cropping system devised by the Institute of
grassland and Environmental Research who suggest that it could be a more
acceptable system for limiting cereal production than the present
set-aside policy.
The institute has been experimenting with a clover base which is
either grazed off or cut for silage in the autumn. Cereal seeds are then
direct-drilled and given only a small amount of nitrogen in early
spring.
Subsequently, the cereal relies on the nitrogen fixed by the clover.
It can either be cut for whole-crop silage (in which case the clover
provides a protein-rich supplement) or left to grow to maturity and
harvested for grain.
In the first year of use the yields of cereal were about 60% of what
might have been achieved with conventional methods. However, because of
the greatly reduced inputs the gross margin was about 90% of what could
have been expected on a high input system.

WE'RE holding the Last Supper at a club in Blythswood Square, Glasgow,
tonight. At least it is the last time Aberdonians in the west will be
able to say their private goodbyes to Buff, Steve, and George, those
stalwarts of North-east entertainment who are currently on the farewell
tour of a phenomenally successful career.
They called themselves Scotland The What? and have done more to spread
the joys of that distinctive Doric humour than any living creature since
the great Harry Gordon.
In contrast to the kilted Harry, they have gained their fame in the
dinner suits of a more sophisticated age, three casual characters and a
piano, with a form of satire they have made their own.
George Donald's brilliance on the keyboard has been further heightened
by the lyrics of Buff Hardie, whose skill with words must surely bear
some comparison with that of Stephen Sondheim, the great lyricist of his
time and the contemporary poet most admired by Hardie himself.
When I told him recently of my conversation with Sondheim in a New
York nightclub, his mouth fell open as if I had just announced a meeting
with God.
It is all a far cry from our schooldays in Aberdeen of 50 years ago
when Buff and I travelled on the same bus and played football in the
playground.
We shared a scene in the school play, performing on a night I remember
well because Winston Churchill had driven up Union Street that day to
receive the freedom of the city.
Little did I realise that I was sharing a stage debut with a lad who
would become a legend of Aberdonianism. If Buff Hardie (called Buff
because of his boyhood fantasy that he was Buffalo Bill) had a limited
chance to reveal his theatrical talent at that time, his day would not
be long delayed.
What we did know 50 years ago was that he had the seeds of academic
brilliance, which were to take him first to Aberdeen University and then
to Cambridge. Though he was already the writer of the student shows at
Aberdeen, the fact that he was not part of that Jonathan Miller set
deprived the Cambridge Footlights of a very special talent.
With due modesty, he did make himself known to the satirical
high-flyers but was given no encouragement whatsoever. Hardie came
quietly back to Aberdeen, was appointed chief executive of Grampian
Health Board -- and resumed his humorous writing for the theatre.
By now, a law student at Aberdeen, Steve Robertson, had become the
leading light in the student shows and a piano-playing linguist from
Huntly, George Donald, had also appeared on the scene.
The three lads teamed up in the Aberdeen Revue Group, which
entertained locally from the fifties into the sixties. But with young
families to divert them, they decided to wrap it all up at the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe of 1969.
For their farewell show they would call themselves Scotland The What?,
a parody of Scotland The Brave. I remember drawing them to the attention
of my old newspaper colleague Neville Garden, who went to see their
Fringe performance and wrote a review which said they were the funniest
performers in the festival.
The crowds rolled in, Scotland The What? was hailed as a new
phenomenon -- and three bewildered Aberdonians went home to think again
about their decision to retire. In fact that ''farewell'' was just the
real beginning -- and for the past 26 years they have flown the flag for
the native tongue and humour of that land in which I grew up.
Their fictitious Auchterturra, with its local pub, the Glaikit Stirk,
has been but the starting-point of a whole body of North-east wit and
humour which has taken them from stage to radio and television and
onwards to the cabaret of cruise-ships.
They have convulsed audiences with everything from phone calls to the
Queen (inviting her to ''open Aulmedrum Games a week on Setterday'') to
brilliant impersonations of Andy Stewart and the Alexander Brothers.
Behind the words has been the genius of Buff Hardie, whose rather
solemn schoolboy face, as I remember it from 50 years ago, must have
been shielding a creative wit just bursting to express itself.
For years the trio ran their theatrical life in tandem with solid,
nine-to-five jobs. While Buff continued to run Grampian Health Board,
Steve was a prosperous Aberdeen lawyer, and George was deputy rector of
Perth Academy.
Into their fifties, they gave up those professions to concentrate on
humour. But now, in the decade of retirement, they have decided that the
touring circuit which has taken them from Auchterturra to London's West
End must come to an end.
There will still be the occasional performance around their native
North-east -- and I wouldn't be surprised to see them in local
pantomime. But the travelling days are over and, after Glasgow,
Inverness and Edinburgh, that farewell tour will reach its climax at His
Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, in November.
Scotland The What? will finally have come home for good. Meanwhile,
after tonight's show at the King's Theatre in Glasgow, those exiled
Aberdonians in the west will be joined by Buff, Steve, and George for
that supper which will be a chance to bid them farewell and say, simply,
''Thanks for the memory''.

A FORMER president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland has
called on the Government to designate Aberdeenshire, Banff and Moray a
disaster area, and to advance subsidy payments to help farmers survive
potentially crippling financial losses.
Flash floods and rain have devastated the harvest in many areas,
leading to estimates of crop losses in excess of #30m, taking account of
projected worth as recently as September 1.
At a packed emergency meeting called by Banff area NFUS leaders in
Keith, one fgarmer appealed to Scottish Agriculture Minister Lord
Lindsay -- who cut short a visit to the west coast to attend -- to look
at a package of measures, both political and practical, to help
ameliorate the crisis.
He asked: ''Could you give us advance payment of monies due to the
industry through arable area payments and hill livestock compensatory
amounts to allow us to buy alternative feed such as sugar beet pulp from
the continent and straw?
''You have established the precedent with the sheep annual premium
paid ahead of schedule, and advances would help us greatly at this
time.''
Endorsing the call, NFUS president John Ross said later the union
would also be pressing to have arable payments accelerated. It might
also be possible to pay out the final part of the 1995 sheep annual
premium a little earlier, but the 1996 HLCA negotiations had not yet
begun and those payments could not be made until farmers' applications
went in at the end of the year.
''Last year, arable area payments were made just before the end of the
year. The regulations allow them to be paid from mid-October and, if
that can be achieved, it would make a big difference to those
affected.''
Mr Ross added there could be a case for the NFUS to campaign for a
specific remedy for a specific problem in one particular region. If he
thought declaring the area a disaster zone would help, he would fight
for that.
Responding sympathetically, Lord Lindsay made it clear there could be
no Government solutions to current problems until the crisis was over.
This week, the NFUS's general purposes committee approved expenditure to
have an independent survey of the damage undertaken, and Lord Lindsay
said it was important to wait until the full picture was known.
The Minister confirmed that no-one would lose arable area payments. He
said he would make it a matter of urgent priority to look at the option
of bringing these payments forward. There might also be an opportunity
to enhance entitlements through the farm and countryside grants scheme.

INTERVIEW: The busy but buoyant Earl of Lindsay gives an optimistic
view of an industry in turmoil.
SIX weeks into his time as Scottish Office Agriculture Minister the
Earl of Lindsay has covered a lot of ground. He has popped up at the
Black Isle Show, Kelso ram sales, the lamb sales at Lairg, and
Thainstone market at Inverurie.
In between, his travels have taken him to Orkney and Shetland and to
the Western Isles. He cancelled a visit to the island of Rhum to attend
an emergency meeting of flood-stricken farmers at Keith last Thursday
evening.
That had all the potential to be his first big test at grassroots
level and he came through with flying colours. ''If you can win over
Banffshire farmers in the middle of crisis you're pretty good,'' was one
assessment. He acquitted himself well although he could make no promises
of Government largesse to help farmers meet their losses.
His staff may be feeling the pace but the man himself shows little
sign of being stressed by a heavy schedule. He does resort to the
comfort of the occasional drag on a cigarette but even that is
accomplished with style -- he uses a cigarette holder. He has been
described as having a winning combination of brains and charm. He may be
the 16th Earl but he does not stand on ceremony. ''Call me, Jamie,'' he
says cheerfully.
His basic outlook on life is upbeat. ''I am always amazed, if you go
back three years, to see that problems we thought were insoluble then
have now been solved,'' he said. ''At heart I am an optimist. There are
many more solutions out there than the pessimists would have us
believe.'' These sentiments specifically referred to environmental
problems but they also serve to sum up his attitude.
While he forecasts significant change in Europe's Common Agricultural
Policy in the medium term, he refuses to get too worried at the
prospect. ''I think that change, when it comes, will be incremental. We
won't have a January 1 watershed -- but each time the Council of
Ministers returns to the table to look at different aspects of the CAP
there will be a change.''
That change, in his view, will be towards a situation in which the
market determines the receipts which farmers will get for their crops.
The subsidies and grants will be geared more towards rewarding the
farmer for the social and environmental contribution which agriculture
makes to rural communities.
Farmers who believe that CAP will be preserved in aspic for ever are
surely kidding themselves, he argues -- but with 85% of Scotland's
agriculture located in Less Favoured Areas he sees no need to panic. The
balance of advantage could tip towards these areas as more importance is
placed on what he terms environmental ingredients -- good landscapes and
good habitats plus the creation of jobs in rural communities and remote
areas.
''That is why I think the Scottish farmers, especially, need not be in
a panic. I would be much more worried if I had 5000 acres in cereals
outside Peterborough.''
What he does have is 500 acres in Fife, near Upper Largo, which he
farms on a low-input basis with about 400 acres being cropped at any one
time. Spring barley is the backbone of the operation. On top of that he
has ''bits and pieces'' which include woodland, water, bog and rough
ground.
Buffer strips where no pesticides or herbicides are applied are
maintained around the edges of all his fields. That permits weed growth
which helps support an insect population and, in turn, the creation of a
rich bio-diversity of habitat. The edges are, he says, the most critical
part of the field in terms of contributing to the wider environment.
He is not, however, an out and out advocate of organic farming. He
points out that 98% of Scotland's farmers opt for traditional methods.
In environmentaL terms, he argues, it is more important, to get that 98%
to use less fertiliser than to double the percentage of organic farmers
from two to four.
There are many ways, he maintains, in which farmers can be more
pro-active in their public relations. They have over the years been
worthy stewards of the countryside but they have to be wary of being
classed as subsidy-dependent -- willing to take steps to protect the
environment only if there is a financial inducement.
It is important to him that people of all ages and types should be
encouraged to visit farms and see what is going on.
Some farmers' union branches have bemoaned the fact that cuts in
education spending have meant there is no longer money available to pay
for the hire of buses to bring school pupils on farm visits.
The Minister's view is that it would do farmers no harm to club
together and meet that cost themselves.
Not that his lordship is one of those who belives that farmers'
pockets are overflowing. ''I am very uneasy about the publicity some
farmers are getting because of the strength of returns and the large
increases which are available at the moment. There are few farmers who
won't remember in the last 10-15 years a heavy loss-making season where
bank overdrafts increased dramatically. It can be very misleading to
think of one year's income as providing a long-term analysis of
agriculture.''
He is very conscious that ''outsiders'' of any sort can get the wrong
picture. One of his concerns is the increasing influence accruing to
people -- politicians and civil servants -- who are not familiar with
agriculture but who are helping to decide what the future of farming
communities will be.
There are reservations, too, about agencies which take the view that
farmers have to be heavily nannied -- not trusted to do anything on
their own account. He admits to being chary of words like preservation
and conservation ''which imply a standstill mentality''. His preference
is for stewardship, enhancement and guardianship.
He does, however, compliment Scottish Natural Heritage on the extent
to which they have bred trust and encouraged genuine partnerships with
different user groups. They come out better, in his book, than the old
Nature Conservancy Council which he viewed as patronising and
dictatorial.
He does not like too many restrictions on farming businesses. ''Our
philosophical position is that we do not like restraints on production
of any type.
''We do not like set-aside, or quotas on the livestock industry.''
Quotas, in the longer term, can only be seen as a source of grief around
the fringes.
''Whatever position you take, whatever reference you take you will end
up with losers.'' In particular, he accepts, production restraints can
be a disadvantage to new entrants.
His sympathies lie with those new-entrant sheep farmers who are still
awaiting an allocation of quota. ''We have made every effort we can with
the national reserve. We are trying to make the best of an imperfect
situation. Quotas are an artificial market contrivance. One of the
things we can achieve with successive CAP reforms is a much fairer
system with less quotas, less restraints and an easier entry system for
those seeking to get into the market.''
On the proposed single retention period for sheep, his sympathies
again lie with producers. ''We would have liked to retain the double
retention period,'' he concedes.
He did promise, however, that the industry's responses to the
consultation document on the proposed change would be looked at
carefully. ''If any new option becomes available we will fight hard to
win it if we can.''

EWAN Stirrat's pastime can be guessed by his nickname ''Boycott''.
Yes, he plays cricket. Striking a ball around Uddingston cricket
ground provides the Lanarkshire solicitor with the relaxation he needs
after negotiating intricate commercial property deals.
Earlier this month he was heavily involved in drawing up the agreement
which saw Botterills, the largest Spar retailers in Britain, buy three
former Safeway store properties in Stenhousemuir, Moodiesburn and
Coatbridge.
When he is not involved in commercial property negotiations the lawyer
is promoting Solicitors' Financial Services, a grouping of 100 Scottish
legal firms who have come together to ensure that they can continue to
give their clients financial advice despite the stringent compliance
rules independent financial advisers have to observe.
''We contract out the work to Sedgewick, which is a major firm of
financial advisers, although the bulk of our members continue to be
authorised through the Personal Investment Authority to give financial
advice.''
Stirrat, who is a director of SFS, admits that since the tightening of
compliance rules many firms of solicitors have opted out of this type of
work although some act as introducers.
However, Solicitors' Financial Services aims to halt this trend and is
organising a number of training roadshows to encourage legal firms to
either remain registered, or to register with the PIA.
''This year the volume of financial advice business handled by SFS
members has increased by 20% despite the fall in popularity of endowment
mortgages.
''But while this business has fallen away we are finding that more
people than ever are coming to our member firms worried about age care.
''Many people are concerned about how they will pay for residence in
an old folk's home, and we are giving them advice on this,'' he
explained.
Being bowled out on the cricket field, says Stirrat, is one thing but
he has no intention of solicitors being bowled out of the financial
advice field.
Land deals brought to the surface
GORDON King spends a good deal of his working life on beautiful golf
courses but when he wants to relax the chances are you will find him
several miles below the surface.
Potholing up to five miles below ground is how he unwinds after a busy
week as head of DM Hall's country department.
The department handles the sale of country houses, managing estates
and advising farmers how they can possibly develop their land for
commercial purposes.
Perhaps the most enjoyable facet of King's job is the involvement with
golf clubs throughout the country. ''We are actively advising ten golf
clubs on a variety of matters,'' says King.
In the past DM Hall has assisted the members of Lochgilphead Golf Club
to buy their course from the local landowners while at present they are
involved in the 18-hole course which is being built at Sunlaws Country
House Hotel.
They have also advised on the creation of several pay-as-you-play
courses such as Whitekirk in East Lothian which was opened earlier this
year, and boasts spectacular views of the Bass Rock.
However, King believes any investment in new courses has to be
approached with caution. ''There are 142 golf course projects with
outstanding planning consent throughout Scotland. I believe that most of
these will not get off the ground,'' says the property consultant.
He points out: ''Scotland does not have the population density to
support all these developments.''
Another reason, he says, is that Scots are not willing to pay as much
for their golf as followers of the sport down south.

THE City is hoping for some signs of economic improvement this week
after the double dose of gloom last Thursday when figures showed
inflation rose and retail sales slumped in August.
The most significant announcement is on Friday when the UK's gross
domestic product in the second quarter of the year is forecast to have
shown a 0.5% rise on the previous quarter and 2.8% on the year.
This was the indication given in provisional data released earlier and
brokers UBS said there was no need to revise those estimates ahead of
Friday.
It said the figures were likely to confirm a pick-up in growth in
consumer expenditure and a strengthening of the recovery in investment,
particularly in the manufacturing sector.
The UK's balance of payment deficit is set to rise for the second
quarter of the year to #1700m from #400m in the previous quarter because
of a drop in surplus on invisible trade, according to figures also
released on Friday.
On Monday, figures for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement -- the
gap between Government income and expenditure -- is set to be revealed
as #3500m for August, taking the deficit for the first five months of
the financial year to #15.8 billion, slightly down on last year's #16
billion.
Investment bank NatWest Markets said the PSBR was still on track to
overshoot the Treasury's forecast of #23.6 billion for the financial
year.
This news will be disappointing for Ministers as political pressure
mounts on the Government to cut spending to fund tax cuts in November's
Budget.

SHE was wearing beige slacks and a loose pink overshirt and carrying a
Boots' plastic shopping bag. She fumbled in her open handbag for some
cash to buy herself a drink. It could possibly have been a long gin and
tonic, but it looked more like sparkling water. What it certainly
wasn't, was Bolli, darling. No-one much drinks Bolli in public in
Hammersmith any night of the week, not even at the theatre.
She looked well, absolutely ordinary, really -- just prettier than
most. The only thing that drew attention to her in the public bar of the
theatre after the show was that she had an armful of three gorgeous
bouquets, mostly comprising Stargazer lilies. They identified her for
what she is: Joanna Lumley, Actress and Star.
As Jenni Murray, the presenter of Woman's Hour, pointed out on the
radio the following morning, she is very ''hot'' at the moment, as an
actress, as a property. She is all over the telly with a new series of
Class Act and a very, very old re-run of The New Avengers. She is
appearing for a month's run at The Lyric, Hammermith, in Somerset
Maugham's The Letter and there are a selected number of interviews with
her appearing in the newspapers.
I say ''selected'' because the property is being very carefully
marketed and managed. When I rang the publicity people at least a month
ago to ask for an interview with the star to coincide with the opening
of the play, they were awfully sorry, but -- Glasgow did you say? -- er,
no. Miss Lumley was only giving a limited number of interviews, and
there were no plans for the play to go to Glasgow, and you know how it
is, they said. I said no, I didn't, and they said I sounded cross. I
said not cross, puzzled. A great many people, I explained, in Glasgow,
as elsewhere in Britain, watched television and had heard or seen the
property and would therefore be interested in reading an interview with
her, whether or not they were likely to find themselves in Hammersmith
with nothing to do for an evening in the course of the month of
September.
They said well, that was how it was and, crossly indeed, I rang off.
But they did give me a press ticket to the show where I found myself
sitting next to Jenni Murray. ''I'm here because I'm interviewing her
tomorrow,'' she said. ''I'm here because I'm not,'' I said.
All of which was really rather silly and this is an article about just
how silly they were to deny The Herald official access to the hot
property. For one thing, at least one of the interviews -- or perhaps
one should say audiences -- that the property was permitted to grant was
extremely unflattering. The writer either clearly disliked the star
before she met her, or had decided to be a bitch. She attacked her for
calling people she didn't know ''Darling'' and was vaguely superior
about the fact that she shops at Sainsbury's. She also called her
''bonkers'' because the star was unwise enough to try to explain how she
had suffered something of a nervous breakdown many years ago and
expressed her continuing anxiety about it happening again -- and thus
about being afraid of fear.
Bonkers? Well, I knew exactly what she meant and I would guess that
many women would. I walked off the set of a live television show once
(fortunately there were lots of others on it) because I was afraid I was
going to have a panic attack. I also call people ''Darling'' which I
know is a detestable mannerism, but there you go, and I shop at the
aforementioned, albeit reluctantly.
There are some conflicting issues around here, however. Although the
play -- used at one stage in history as a vehicle for Gladys Cooper --
is being used in Hammersmith as a vehicle for La Lumley, everyone denies
that. La L does (I know because she told Jenni Murray so most ardently).
The programme does, because no-one gets any ordered billing so that
no-one can claim that La L is the star that we all know she is. And, in
any case, the vehicle in question has been propelled upon its journey
for quite another purpose: The Lyric, Hammersmith, has suffered horribly
from Arts Council funding cuts and desperately needs bums on seats.
Enter, stage left, the star (that she says she isn't). She speaks
eloquently on the radio the next day, explaining her approach to the
theatre in general and the part of the murderous jealous woman she plays
in particular. It is very convincing. The play is only about jealousy in
her view -- not about racism or the social attitudes on the Malayan
plantations in the early years of this century -- and could well have
been set in Wokingham, she told my friend Jenni.
She was then unwise enough to change this analogy a few minutes later
by saying that it could have been set somewhere in Scotland. What!
Scotland! Did she not know of the snub she had delivered to Scotland by
declining to be interviewed on the subject of her appearance in a play
that wasn't going to Glasgow? Huh!
In everything that she says in this radio interview I find her
profoundly admirable. Asked about her many current telly appearances,
you could hear her shuddering and -- more importantly -- you do know
that she means it. And how do we know that, darlings? Because when she
described how ''horrible'' it was to find herself such a hot property
and on the television all the time, she didn't giggle in a silly fashion
and thus indicate that she really thought it was absolutely fabulous.
What she did say was that she thought people should spend more time
reading books. ''I'm trying to get people to read,'' she said. TV
repeats were boring. No-one got bored reading books.
I like Joanna Lumley, she to whom I have never spoken, because she
seems to have a great deal of common sense. I could have talked to her
when she was in the bar after the show. She happily posed for a snap
with someone, she signed a few autographs for some others. She sat
around, laughing and chatting with her fellow actors, for at least half
an hour after the show and I could easily have approached her instead of
spending the time rubber-necking.
Somehow, though, I felt that would be wrong. Yet the really silly
thing is that it would have enabled me to have written so much more
informed a piece about her. And more understanding, too, than the one I
did read. If she ever gets in touch, I'll let you know, darling.
What! Scotland! Did she not know of the snub she had delivered to
Scotland by declining to be interviewed?

<HEADLINE>Security call after illegal immigrant leaps off train</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976322822</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN MP called for tighter security measures yesterday after a man
jumped from a speeding Chunnel train while leaving the country under a
Home Office scheme which allows illegal immigrants to make their own way
out of the country.
The Algerian deportee leapt from the high-speed Waterloo to Brussels
train on Saturday night.
Five immigration officials had put Bonito Cobbola on the train but
none of them accompanied him because its doors are sealed while it is in
motion.
He sat quietly on board but as the train went through Sandling in
Kent, a door alarm sounded in the driver's cab. The carriage door was
found open.
Cobbola jumped while the train was moving at 45mph. He appears to have
survived the leap but rail staff were still searching the track last
night in case he did not.
A Eurostar spokesman has said an emergency handle on the door was used
to open it.
Now Mr David Shaw, the MP for Dover, has questioned the Home Office
policy and claimed the incident raised serious concerns over security.
Mr Shaw also said it exposed a loophole by which, unlike ferry
companies and airlines, users of the Channel Tunnel are not financially
liable for people they bring into Britain without proper documents.
The MP said: ''Clearly it is very worrying that this person, who was
being asked to leave the country, was unescorted.
''One of the problems is that the Channel Tunnel is exempt from the
fines that are imposed on the ferry companies and the airlines when they
bring in people who have not got the proper documents.
''It means that the cost of providing an escort to remove anyone
brought in to this country by the users of the tunnel has to be met by
the taxpayer and not the carrier.
''They would check papers more carefully but they don't have the
incentive of a cash penalty which, from the point of view of the ferry
companies, is grossly unfair.''
Cobbola had arrived in Britain on Saturday afternoon on a Eurostar
train from Lille, France, but was refused entry when immigration
officials found he was travelling with a forged Italian passport.
A Home Office spokeswoman said that since November last year 590
would-be illegal immigrants had been asked to leave Britain via the
Eurostar service through the Channel Tunnel after being refused entry to
the UK.
She said that, of those, ''no more than half a dozen have been
escorted.''
A Home Office Spokesman said: ''In almost every case, a person is
given the opportunity to leave the country under their own steam.
''We don't tend to go into a heavy-handed attitude where people are
dragged kicking and screaming out of the country.
''It is not unusual for people to abscond and once re-captured they
are escorted.''
Inspector Alistair Cumming, with the British Transport Police, at
Ashford, Kent, said: ''Following the report last night that someone was
believed to have jumped from a train, we mounted a search of the track
but found nothing.
''We are going to hold a further search this morning because it is my
concern that this person could be lying injured somewhere.''

SCOTLAND'S newest conference centre dented the fortunes of its English
rivals as it opened its doors for the first time yesterday.
For the #38m Edinburgh International Conference Centre poached the
Kwik Fit Silver Jubilee group conference for managers from Birmingham's
National Exhibition Centre, it was revealed.
Six plane loads of managers touched down at Edinburgh airport
yesterday morning bound for the centre.
The centre took three years to build and was beset by planning
difficulties.
Chairman and chief exeutive of the Edinburgh-based company, Mr Tom
Farmer, said: ''I've flown in 1300 people from all over Europe for this.
''Without the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, it would not
have been in Scotland. We usually go to the NEC.
''But I've always wanted to come to Edinburgh. I've been all over the
world and this centre is among the best I've seen.
''I'm delighted we are the first people to use the Edinburgh
facility.''
A spokesman for the EICC revealed they had more than 100 bookings
before the doors of the plush new facility, which can cater for up to
1500 people, even opened.
''We are the first conference centre in Europe to break the 100
bookings barrier before opening day,'' she said.
Among the events bound for Edinburgh next year are the Scottish
Advertising Awards and the Thistle Awards -- both usually held at
Glasgow hotels.
But the spokeswoman denied the centre was in competition with its
Scottish neighbour.
''Our market is the globe. We have conferences booked by groups from
Australia, US, Europe, and South America. About two-thirds of our
business is from overseas.
''We are not competing with the SECC in Glasgow. We complement each
other.''

I WAS concerned about a major generalisation in the article on Leslie
Kenton (Health Extra, September 7).
To suggest, regarding abortion, that ''the pro-lifers argue for
contraception, the feminists for the right to abort'' is an
irresponsible sweeping statement, particularly given that this issue has
become one of life and death in the United States (for adult as well as
foetuses) and could do so here.
Where abortion is concerned ''pro-lifers'' argue above all against
abortion, that is induced termination of pregnancy, and are by no means
all in favour of any form of contraception.
Feminists such as myself do not think as one on this issue.
Women who are feminists have a range of views about how women can and
should control their fertility, although they would probably share the
opinion that individual women must be allowed a say when it comes to
their own fertility.

STEPHEN Ferguson (September 14) might not have any more sympathy for
priests who express a wish for sexual relations, but he might understand
matters better if he had heard the distinction once drawn for me
(without comment) by a priest.
Celibacy means bachelorhood, not taking a wife, a condition endured by
Catholic clergy since its papal imposition, probably by one of the
Gregorys. Chastity means abstinence from sexual relations.
It would be interesting to know whether the Church still quietly
maintains the semantic difference, or just relies on the confusion of
the two which exists in the public understanding. Perhaps we should ask
the Bishop of Galway.

IS apathy really the reason for the fall-off in parent volunteers for
school boards? I think not. Parents do care but may choose not to show
it by allotting their spare energy to the board.
Why? The officious image and procedures bestowed on boards by the
powers-that-be are off-putting and difficult to interpret for the
uninitiated. With notable exceptions, like helping to appoint a head
teacher, their statutory tasks are often tedious and ineffective.
The unwieldly brief that they have been given sits as uneasily on
parent members as it does on staff members and must often confuse the
generous co-optees.
Grasping the jargon and procedures of educational administration is no
mean feat for a volunteer who is not using them daily. Well-meaning
parental interest can sometimes be interpreted as interference by staff
already burdened with the administrative challenges of DMR or national
testing. And then there are the multitude of allied organisations
demanding board members' reactions.
Hardly surprising, therefore, that many of us lack the confidence or
the will to speak out in a public minuted meeting; we will feel more
inclined to offer our support directly to the school or PTA, Boys'
Brigade, Brownies, youth club, or church where you can see the results
on peoples' faces and in the treasurer's report. These groups must find
volunteers to survive, unlike a school which can get on without a board.
But board nominees will continue to emerge from different motivation
-- out of a sense of parental responsibility, appreciation of the school
and a desire to put something back, a genuine interest in the
comprehensive education ideal.
If this voluntary energy is taken lightly, or partronised by those in
paid positions of authority, board members will become frustrated and
demoralised.
Dubious in concept though the school board is, it is the only
structure currently available to school communities to have a voice
which can benefit from being heard in harmony with those of other
boards.
Our school hums day and night with activities that enrich the lives of
local people of all ages and make it a secure community in which to
bring up children. The building supplies the geographical hub and, for
many, the spiritual heart of that community.
But every school has its own story of aspiration and need to relate
when necessary; the forthcoming changeover to unitary authorities may
well be the time. I think it'll be worth staying on the board to see
that through.

I READ with interest the letter from Mr David Hamilton regarding the
pilot wave-energy plant on Islay (September 14). I believe, however,
that his point about Scottish Natural Heritage requesting total removal
of the structure requires some clarification.
The plant was constructed as a pilot project with a planned study
lifetime and it was always the intention that it would be decommissioned
at the end of the period. In any such development it is prudent to think
ahead to what will happen to the facility when it is no longer in use.
I am sure that Mr Hamilton would agree that decaying structure of
concrete and metal set in such a strikingly beautiful area could, in
time, very much detract from the quality of the landscape.
Scottish Natural Heritage welcomes examination of alternative and
sustainable energy sources and I understand that engineers from Queen's
University, Belfast, have plans to carry out further wave-energy
research using a new plant on the same site.

ALF YOUNG was petulant and ill-informed when he launched a highly
emotional attack upon Friends of the Earth Scotland (September 15) over
its story that the Scottish public was misled about the need for
Torness.
He accuses the Green movement of ''reducing fiendishly complex issues
to banal simplicities in its pursuit of publicity''. He does not help
his case by making the common mistake of confusing the hole in the ozone
layer with global warming; nuclear power stations, even if they
contribute to reducing CO2 levels, do little to help ozone depletion
which is caused primarily by CFC and halon emissions.
He calls for rational debate and alternatives. For almost 20 years our
Safe Energy Journal has looked in great detail at the problems of
nuclear power and the alternatives.
It is read widely in the energy industry throughout the world and has
been described as required reading by a senior government adviser. Being
a technical journal it attracts little publicity but we invest in its
production out of recognition of the complexity of the issues involved.
In all that time, until now, we have never seen an admission from
Scottish Nuclear that Torness was built to prop up the nuclear
engineering industry at a time of slump. Alf Young provides no evidence
to the contrary.
The admission at this late date has sparked a row, with Sir Donald
Miller, chairman of the SSEB till 1992, denying it and still maintaining
that Torness was built to meet demand, to replace capacity, and to
provide as cheap a power supply as possible.
Scottish Nuclear is a monopoly which has a guaranteed market for the
over-priced fuel which it supplies; it is not meeting a demand and it is
not cheap. Yet it spends millions of our money on expensive advertising
campaigns to persuade us that is good for us.
Unlike Scottish Nuclear we cannot afford full-page adverts so we
carefully research and proffer alternative views to the press. You can
choose to use them or not.
But for Alf Young now to question the ethics of even raising such
concerns is a very strange form of journalism indeed.

THE general tenor of Barclay McBain's report is to suggest that
Scottish parents are reluctant to join/stand for school boards because
of apathy (September 15). I suggest an alternative and worthy
explanation -- viz, that eligible parents do not perceive it as just or
fair that they alone should have an inbuilt majority on boards.
Eligible (ie, ''current'') parents may be well aware of the mismatch
between the temporary duration of their eligibility and the potentially
long-term effects of decisions in which they might participate -- eg,
opting-out decisions.
All Scots (and therefore Scottish parents) are proud, willing, and
happy to claim the education of children as a societal privilege and
obligation, not an exclusively parental duty. Only parents who opt out
of state education have exclusive (of other citizens) rights to
determine the nature of that education.
Within state education all of us (past parents, present parents,
non-parents, and future parents) have rights to influence; rights which
we exercise through our elected bodies (local authority and
parliamentary); rights which are paralleled by our universal
contributions, via taxation, to the maintenance of the system.
The present nature of school boards, with excessive emphasis on
current parenthood, militates against that societal acceptance of
responsibility for education and can only alienate.
Such a divorce between the education of our children (ie, society's
children) and society itself would be a tragic end to Scotland's long
love affair with the desirability of education for all.
Perhaps Scottish parents are wise rather than apathetic. I hope so.

PERHAPS in the belief that no-one in the affected group would
understand it, Michael Portillo, in his brief incumbency as Employment
Secretary, announced that the state pension for anyone now aged under 40
would be nugatory.
In plainer terms it means barely worth queueing up for at the Post
Office, but the fact that he said it at all is a significant pointer to
just how far expectations have changed from the present generation of
pensioners who expect the state to look after them ''to the grave''.
British pension funds now amount to more than the total provision for
the rest of the European Union. Many Britons can expect to be better-off
in old age than their contemporaries in the European Union as a result
of the extensive system of occupational pensions now augmented by
private pensions and SERPS, the state scheme.
The overall expectations of pensioners throughout Europe are much the
same: retirement between 60 and 70 on a pension funded by the state but
variable according to compulsory insurance contributions.
In Britain, the level of state pension is lower than most of Europe
and tied to prices rather than wages, which from the point of view of
the taxpayer is a bonus, although from the pensioner's angle is not
quite so rosy.
* Belgium: The principle is that anyone who has been employed is
covered by old-age insurance. It is a three-part benefit including
old-age pension (payable to both men and women at the age of 60 although
they can choose to work until 65), a heating allowance awarded to
retired coal-miners, and holiday pay.
The full pension amounts to 60% of the average earnings of the
pensioner during the entire working life or 75% if there is a dependent
spouse. It is calculated on the basis of 1/45th of the full pension rate
for men for each year worked, 1/40th for women and seamen, 1/30th for
miners after 20 years' service, and 1/14th for seamen with at least 168
months at sea.
Pensioners can work provided their income does not exceed a certain
limit.
* Denmark: All residents in Denmark are entitled to an ordinary
retirement pension when they reach the age of 67 and there is a
compulsory supplementary pension scheme for people in employment.
Retirement pensions consist of a basic rate (means-tested for those
under 67 and awarded on health grounds but universal after that age,
although reduced for people in paid employment).
* Germany: Normal retirement pension -- paid to everybody who is
subject to compulsory pension insurance -- is paid at the age of 65. At
present women can receive it at 60 if they have paid compulsory
contributions for at least 10 years after reaching the age of 40, but
the age limit is in the process of being raised to 65. The amount is
dependent on the amount of contributions paid.
* Greece: Old-age pensions can be paid at 65 for men and 60 for women
to people who have worked at least 4500 days, or at the ages of 62 and
57 for people who have worked at least 10,000 days (about 33 years).
Both men and women who have been employees for 35 years can receive a
pension at 58.
There is a basic pension, the amount of which depends on previous
earnings, plus several supplements, the main one being for a wife who is
not employed or receiving a pension. A woman is entitled to a supplement
for her husband only if he is disabled, with no income, and dependent on
her for his maintenance.
* Spain: Contributory old-age pensions are paid at the age of 65; the
minimum contribution period is 15 years. The full pension is paid for 35
years of contributions. Partial retirement is possible between the ages
of 62 and 65 for people who work half-time for half salary plus half
pension provided another employee is taken on to cover the other half of
the job.
* France: Paid at 65, but a smaller pension (which cannot exceed half
the maximum salary for which contributions are paid) is available at 60
to certain groups, for example those who are unfit for work. It is
backed up by non-contributory benefits, such as an increase for
pensioners whose pension is below the fixed minimum, and an old-age
allowance.
* Italy: Employees are entitled to old-age pensions after 35 years of
contributions although pension age is being gradually increased to 65
for men and 60 for women from the year 2002 onwards. Self-employed
people in certain categories (smallholders, tenant farmers, craftsmen,
and tradespeople) are also entitled to pensions at 65 and 60, but
self-employed people in ''the liberal professions'' have to satisfy more
complex rules.
* Luxembourg: Old-age pensions are paid from 65, but can be paid from
the age of 57 or 60 depending on the length of contributions. The
flat-rate pension is based on 40 years' contributions topped up by 1.78%
of earnings throughout the working life.
* Netherlands: All men and women are entitled to old-age pension from
the age of 65, the amount dependent on the length of contributions. It
is uprated in line with wages twice a year.
* Portugal: A pension is payable to both men and women at the age of
65 if they have a minimum of 15 years' contributions, although there is
the possibility of early retirement from the age of 60. The amount is
not less than 30% or more than 80% of previous average earnings and a
supplement is paid to those whose pension is lower than the guaranteed
minimum.

As the Government battles to cut public spending, armed forces fat
cats continue to march on a full wallet, according to George Hume
AS red-capped Military Police continue this week to sift the bunkers
at a golf links in Ayrshire for clues in the mysterious affair of the
clubs and the helicopter, taxpayers and Cabinet Ministers alike are
totting up the cost of armed forces profligacy.
Top brass at Scottish Command might be forgiven for keeping their
swagger sticks crossed in the hope that the allegation that a senior
Army officer in the north-east commandeered a forces helicopter to get
to a golf tournament -- and sent his clubs on the 220-mile yomp by staff
car, will prove unfounded.
But whatever the outcome of the investigation -- at first stopped
almost as soon as it started and only re-opened through public pressure
-- critics of the manner in which the armed forces splash out with the
public purse are never short of ammunition, their disquiet fed by recent
revelations of prodigal behaviour more in keeping with the days of The
Thin Red Line.
Thanks to the oddly-titled Options for Change programme of defence
cuts that line is getting thinner -- but not at a great pace. The RAF,
for example, has just determined that its Turnhouse base on the
outskirts of Edinburgh, after no less than a quarter century without an
operational role, can close next year. The 135 staff there -- whose main
task has been to provide a VIP landing site for royal visits -- will
not, however, lose their jobs but will be posted elsewhere.
Therefore, ''thinner'' is a relative concept. Some fat cats come in
khaki, navy serge, and airforce blue -- as yet unconvinced of the need
to abandon a lifestyle to which, in their own home, they were never
accustomed. In an arcane world where lower ranks still sweat, officers
perspire, and their wives merely glow, the Ministry of Defence counters
revelations of heavy spending and over-staffing on the comforts front
with the claim that even generals ''make their own scrambled egg in the
morning and go to work by tube''.
That scrambled egg in Scotland may well be made in a kitchen with two
cookers standing side by side. Regulations require that officers of a
certain rank require six-burner capacity to cope with home
entertainment. So far skilful foraging has equipped only Royal Navy
quarters at Rosyth with six-burner cookers and throughout the rest of
the land colonels, group captains, and captains are having to make do
with two ordinary four-burner cookers -- two of the burners permanently
''stood down''.
Headline grabbing gaffes such as the #300,000 plus approved by a
senior RAF officer for the refurbishment of his house -- the military
prefers the phrase ''official residence'' -- and #3 a day extra pay for
corporals whose duties involve shoehorning generals into riding breeches
and spurred boots to attend functions at which no horses will be
required, though entertaining, divert attention from the true picture.
The bald fact is that as Government Ministers wrestle to squarebash
the circle of public spending, keenly scrutinising the social security
budget, the armed forces march forward on a heavily armed wallet . . .
chauffeur-driven cars for officers the equivalent of middle management
in civilian life, full-time domestic servants who enjoy Civil Service
pensions, regimental mess silver driven into a field so that lunch may
be properly served during manoeuvres, and for all, financial aid with
boarding school fees whether serving at home or abroad.
There is also the ''X'' factor, currently 11.5% added to salaries to
compensate for the ''inconvenience of service life''. For most the
''inconvenience'' of service life means a home base in the UK or a
posting to Germany.
Current average gross weekly earnings for men in Scotland stand at
#335, for women #244 . . . which scale up to #17,420 and #12,688 a year.
Pity you did not take the Queen's Shilling, particularly if you are a
woman, for in the armed forces females are paid the same as their male
counterparts.
Officers from second lieutenant to field marshal enjoy salaries
ranging from #13,000 to the #120,000 mark . . . horses still provided
from the public purse for recreation of the right type. But it is the
pay and perks of other ranks, viewed against the civilian average made
up from the incomes of doctors to doormen, that most starkly shows just
how heavily The Professionals score.
A private soldier rated first class earns #14,688 a year -- a sergeant
#18,314, length of service adds to these figures as does service in
Northern Ireland (#4.13 a day extra) and, for special military
qualifications there is even more -- paratroopers' bank balances go up
as they come down. Married soldiers separated from their families can be
eligible for a separation allowance.
A very real perk comes in the form of heavily subsidised charges for
accommodation and food. An adult single corporal or below (and their
RN/RAF equivalent) living in barracks has to meet a weekly charge of
#8.42 for accommodation and #20.93 for food . . . so answers on a
postcard please as to where bed and board can be obtained for #1526.20 a
year outwith the armed forces. Married soldiers have to pay #26.60 a
week for the rent of a three-bedroom house.
But what happens when the so-called Peace Dividend and Options for
Change come together to spell redundancy? A private with 22 years'
service receives a pension of around #4000 a year in addition to a
re-settlement grant of almost #6000 and a severance grant three times
the level of pension.
Available generally when the recipient of the P45 is in his early
forties, it all eases the pain of parting. Field marshals given the
bullet do somewhat better -- retired pay standing in excess of #55,000 a
year.
What the Red Caps may find in the sand on that Ayrshire links is
unknown. But the question remains, can the armed forces be routed from
the comfort zone or will Options for Change still leave them going into
battle mounted astride a six-burner cooker, armed to the teeth with an
''X'' factor?

Washington
CUBAN police have arrested Frank Terpil, a fugitive CIA agent and arms
dealer who is accused of selling arms to Libya and training Libyan
agents in making explosives. Some news accounts have linked him with the
Lockerbie bombing.
The Lockerbie connection is unproved, but he certainly sold the
Libyans timing devices and plastic explosives to make bombs that were
then used against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's enemies. At least 11 bombs
were used, in Britain, Egypt, Italy, and the United States. Terpil was
arrested in New York in an elaborate sting operation conducted by city
police, in 1979, and jumped bail.
He was convicted in absentia, and has lived in the Middle East and
Cuba since then.
Now the Washington Post reports that he has been identified by
Canadian diplomats in Havana, and that the Cuban police have put him
under house arrest. He had allegedly offered his services to visiting
Canadian businessmen, promising that he could provide them with useful
contacts with the Cuban Government.
He never kept the promises and never repaid the large sums he had
extorted from the gullible Canadians. He used an alias, but was
identified by the stories he told: one of his favourites is that he
supplied arms to Idi Amin in Uganda, and was present at a dinner at
which Amin had the head of his Minister of Defence served up on a large
platter.
Terpil is the second prominent fugitive to be arrested by Fidel
Castro. The first was Robert Vesco, who has lived in the Caribbean since
absconding with several hundred million dollars looted from an
international investment fund in the late 1960s.
Terpil and a colleague, Edwin Wilson, set up a training school for
terrorists in Libya in the mid-70s. Their students were to be trained in
making explosives. Wilson and Terpil sold the Libyans large numbers of
timers, at grossly inflated prices. This is the equipment and skill
needed to make the Lockerbie bomb.
In 1979, the New York police set up a sting operation, which involved
the fictitious purchase of Sten guns from a gun dealer in Manchester.
The trap was sprung at Christmas, and Terpil and his associates were
arrested in a New York hotel. Raids were carried out on a hotel in the
Midlands and a mews house in London owned by Terpil. He was charged with
gun-running and skipped bail.
His senior partner, Wilson, was later lured out of Libya and given a
life sentence in the United States.

Launching a thought-provoking series on the debate that will become
the major issue of the next century, Jennifer Cunningham and Gavin Bell
examine the daunting challenges facing Britain's growing army of
pensioners and the questions society must face up to.
WE ARE at the beginning of a debate which will be both lengthy and
passionate and as it sharpens will become suddenly vital to many voters'
interests. The population of working age is set to fall to about 86% of
present levels, with the biggest drop after the turn of the century,
while the number of people over pensionable age is expected to increase
by 48% by the year 2032, mainly after 2011, according to the latest
projections by the Registrar-General.
Under the current provisions for old-age pensions and income support,
fewer people of working age will have to support more elderly people.
The crunch is that the over-85s in Britain will increase from 800,000
now to two million by the middle of the next century. Last year the cost
to the taxpayer was #2200m for residential and nursing care for the
elderly. By the year 2021, it could be #17.4bn.
Two years ago, the Scottish Office announced it wanted a ''substantial
reduction'' in the number of in-patient NHS beds, including those for
frail, elderly people.
A Scottish Office circular of September 1992 restated the policy that
inappropriate admissions to institutional care should be prevented.
Where should these cases be more appropriately cared for? The answer,
since 1993, has been in the community.
The policy involves a transfer of public funds from the NHS and the
DSS to local authorities who will still draw on the DSS for individual
benefits to pay for care.
Since the Community Care Act, anyone who cannot pay the full cost of
long-term residential care from their own resources -- the majority of
those over the age of 75 -- has to be assessed by the local social work
department.
The Scottish Office circular of September 1992 draws a distinction
between those who need long-term care and those requiring the
''specialist medical and nursing supervision'' responsibilities it
allocates clearly to the NHS. Thus defined, they are entitled to free
care, while those in need of non-specialist care must contribute to the
cost.
People with capital assets of more than #8000 are expected to pay for
their own care until their capital is reduced to #8000. They may then
become eligible for income support towards the cost of their care.
That will mean the sale of the family home unless a relative continues
to live there. Since it is obvious that no-one can live both in their
own home and in residential care, it seems a perfectly reasonable way to
pay for care -- at least until the money runs out -- but the policy is
at odds with the Prime Minister's stated vision of ''wealth cascading
down the generations''.
Indeed the yowls of the home-owning democracy are expected soon to
result in amendment to that legislation. One possibility (increasingly
lobbied by Conservatives) is raising the #8000 threshold. A longer-term
strategy could institute a system of compulsory insurance against future
nursing-home costs.
Fewer than 10% of residents currently pay the full charge.
A survey of local authorities carried out for Age Concern Scotland by
Mary Thomas discovered significant increases between the charges in
1992-93 and those for 1993-94 as the departments follow Government
instructions to make a charge approximate to the true economic cost of
the service. The percentage increases varied from 4.5% in the Western
Isles where the maximum charge is #173.80, to 90.5% in Orkney where the
maximum charge is #300.
The highest charge is Central's #442, although variations in standards
of accommodation and levels of service make straight comparison
impossible.
Voluntary organisations are being knowingly and cavalierly squeezed
between the agendas of national and local government, according to the
Church of Scotland which has subsidised the public coffers by #10m
during the past five years to meet the cost of caring for the 800 people
who live in its 43 eventide homes.
Voluntary organisations, such as churches and benevolent societies,
have based their fees on the income support levels payable to residents
who have been in the home since before April 1993. However, these rates,
usually #185 a week for residential care, #225 for those who are more
dependent, and #280 for those in nursing-home care, have been condemned
by both the voluntary and private sectors as too low to meet their
costs.
The Kirk is losing #60 per person per week because the fees from the
social work departments do not match the cost of care. The long-term
outlook is clearly one of staff cuts, or as was forcefully put at this
year's General Assembly, home closures.
''We are being used as a pawn between local and central Government and
that is not an unusual position for voluntary organisations,'' said
Joyce Buchanan, who has responsibility for older people as deputy
director of social work for the Church of Scotland.
''Before 1983 the providing bodies and the local authorities together
decided what a reasonable fee was. At that time, unless the voluntary
homes paid wage rates which were comparable to those in local authority
homes, old people would not be placed there,'' she said.
In 1983, the Government decided it was time to move from local
authority-funded homes to DSS means-testing of individuals. That gave
the green light to the private sector and there was a sudden increase in
the number of private homes in the mid-80s.
One of the differences from the previous system was that social work
departments no longer assessed the needs of individuals before they were
admitted. According to Mrs Buchanan, after that time, more people were
placed inappropriately in residential and nursing care. The spiralling
DSS costs prompted the inquiry by Sir Roy Griffiths which resulted in
the NHS and Community Care Act in 1990.
''There have been people who have suggested we should pay our staff
less and that is what some of the private operators do. The Act stated
that local authorities should pay what was reasonable, but that is open
to extremely wide interpretation. They have fixed scales and overtime
rates agreed with the unions, and the voluntary organisations pay
roughly comparable rates. Most private home-owners pay less for overtime
and weekend working.''
The lack of sufficiently funded provision for frail, old people is a
matter of deep concern to Joyce Buchanan. ''A society should be able to
be judged by how it cares for its weakest and frailest, so we all need
to ask ourselves what our provision for old people says about us as a
society. The truth is that we are failing our very old people. We are
applying the principles of market forces to the most vulnerable people
in society.
''Many of the old people now in care had no opportunity for an
occupational pension. They are living through the decline of the welfare
state but have been unable to buy into the brave new world we are
supposed to be creating.
''We need to deal with the predicted demographic explosion because
people will continue to live longer. The oldest person in Britain is one
of our residents and she is 112. Are all these people just to be written
off? The value of life must be more than the economic cost, and unless
we are willing to hold fast to that principle we are on a very slippery
slope.''

Taba
ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he and PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat would meet late into the night to try to hammer out an elusive
agreement on wider Palestinian self-rule.
As a September 21 target date for a Washington signing ceremony
neared, Israeli and PLO officials said they were still divided over the
key issue of the West Bank town of Hebron, where 400 Jewish settlers
live among 100,000 Palestinians.
''I estimate the negotiations will continue until tomorrow morning,''
Peres told reporters in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, before his
third meeting of the day with Arafat.
''We will hold a lengthy meeting tonight. There will be differences
and agreements but we will do our utmost to complete the negotiations,''
he said.
Peres gave no indication what might happen if Israel and the PLO
failed to meet Thursday's target date for an accord, already 16 months
behind schedule, on an Israeli troop pull-back in the occupied West Bank
and Palestinian elections.
''I gave no ultimatums,'' he said.
Israel Army Radio reported that US officials were pressing for clear
word tonight on whether a White House signing ceremony could be held on
Thursday.
Peres declined to disclose the contents of an Israeli plan for the
city which the Palestinians rejected earlier in the day.
PLO officials said it was based on dividing Hebron into three areas
and described this as ''very dangerous''.
Hebron is holy to Jews and Arabs, and the traditional site of tomb of
the biblical patriarch Abraham where a Jewish settler massacred 29 Arab
worshippers in February last year.

AFTER Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, he might be termed Sinn
Fein's Third Man. More and more, his voice is heard on television and
radio expounding the current thinking of the IRA's political wing.
British, Irish, and American officials hang on his words for signs of
political shift as they struggle to find a formula which might break the
worrying deadlock over Ulster's peace process. On both sides of the
Atlantic, this stockily-built, middle-aged man is invited to political
forums and seminars, because of his impressive ability to articulate the
position of his party in the light of the IRA's year-long ceasefire.
Despite the high profile of Adams and McGuinness, John Mitchel
McLaughlin is now emerging in the media as the real guru of Irish
Republicanism. While Adams stalked the corridors of the White House last
week and McGuinness led the Sinn Fein delegation that has been meeting
British ministers in recent months, McLaughlin is the thinking
strategist who calls the shots in their international propaganda battle
with London and the unionist majority in Ulster.
Like so many involved in Sinn Fein or the IRA, he is not a
first-generation Irish republican. His family background was steeped in
the militant politics of a frustrated Catholic community in a city
dominated by Protestant unionists. The seat of their power was
Londonderry's ornate Guildhall but today it is McLaughlin and other
Catholic councillors who hold sway in the same council chamber. The
revolution that began with the troubles of 1968 has turned Derry (the
name they prefer) into a very different place.
Even at birth, McLaughlin now 49 years old, was linked to
republicanism in the Christian names his mother chose for him. John
Mitchel, a Presbyterian, was one of the original United Irishmen in the
1798 rebellion against the British. Irish republicans revere the memory
of that period when Presbyterians and Catholics were on the same side
opposing the church and state establishment of the period and seeking
civil rights that were denied to them.
In 1966, a new rebellion loomed in which John Mitchel McLaughlin would
play a major part. Just turned 20 years old, he had already followed
family tradition and joined Sinn Fein, as Ulster rumbled towards the
violence that would beset it for 25 years.
Derry was a cauldron about to boil over in 1968 with days and nights
of rioting and the arrival of the first British troops on the streets as
the local police lost control. Though the Catholic civil rights campaign
was broadly-based and even numbered some liberal unionists among its
early support, it swiftly took a more overtly militant and violent path.
What role McLaughlin played is not clear. Another even younger Derry
republican at the time was Martin McGuinness, who became the IRA
commander in the city and has maintained a much higher profile ever
since. McLaughlin says he was ''not really what people would think a
typical member of Sinn Fein would be''.
It seems that from the outset he chose to be some kind of backroom
think-tank, a role he excels at today. He was active in housing and
unemployment protests in the late 1960s and 1970s, ''naturally
graduating towards the civil rights movement''. The roots of his support
lay in the Catholic neighbourhoods of the Bogside and Creggan, hotbeds
of IRA activity in the past 25 years.
Unlike many other leading Sinn Fein activists, including Adams and
McGuinness, McLaughlin has never been in jail. Until fairly recently he
was employed as a refrigeration engineer. He operates politically from a
dingy Sinn Fein office in Derry dividing his time between local council
business and his wider role in Sinn Fein as one of its principal
spokesmen.
He has been arrested several times over the years but never convicted.
In 1987, he was among 24 Sinn Fein activists held for questioning when
British and Irish security forces mounted a massive operation to find
IRA weapons. In 1990, he and Martin McGuinness were among 15 men charged
with interfering with the closure of cross-bordered roads but the
charges were subsequently dropped.
While he has undoubted influence on the IRA, there is no concrete
evidence of any direct links with the outlawed organisation, past or
present. Yet despite that, he could say in 1993, long before the IRA
ceasefire was announced, ''I am a well-informed republican and it is my
view that the IRA would cease its campaign and it is my view that they
have the discipline to enforce this among their members''.
Mitchel McLaughlin is undoubtedly a key strategist behind the Sinn
Fein/IRA position and has been for more than a decade. When Gerry Adams
took over the presidency of Sinn Fein, pushing aside an old guard,
McLaughlin established himself as one of the new lieutenants, hovering
in the background at party conferences but often pushed forward to brief
journalists on Sinn Fein policies.
In 1985, he was elected a member of Derry City Council, as Sinn Fein
sought to build on its ''armalite in one hand, ballot box on the other''
philosophy. More and more, the political voices of Irish republicanism
would be heard above the sound of the IRA's bombs and guns, and
McLaughlin's time had come.
He was at the centre of an abortive High Court legal challenge in 1988
to the Government broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. In 1990, his deep
knowledge of republican history and the modern political situation, had
so impressed Sinn Fein that he was appointed its Northern chairman and
now he holds the same post for all of Ireland.
As the going gets tough for Sinn Fein, McLaughlin appears an
increasingly valuable weapon in the propaganda war. He now appears more
regularly on national television. With his calm unfluttered style and
articulate ability to answer awkward and embarrassing questions, he is
fast becoming the most acceptable public face that Sinn Fein has to
offer. Neither Adams nor McGuinness appear to have his subtlety or grasp
of the intricacies of the current situation.
In the past few months, his profile has risen in other directions.
Last May, he became the first Sinn Fein leader to shake hands in public
with a Government minister. At university debates and major political or
economic conferences, he is a frequent speaker. He is believed to have
played a key role in the run-up to the IRA's ceasefire in the top secret
negotiations which were conducted with British and Irish officials and
in the talks between Gerry Adams and the SDLP leader John Hume. Many
observers believe that what the Sinn Fein president says and does is
sometimes based on what McLaughlin thinks.
Certainly he seems able to formulate policy with confidence even
though he and his party still stand in the shadow of the IRA's gunmen.
In 1991, for instance, he described the IRA bombing of a London railway
station as ''a catastrophe'' not only for the victims but for the
republican movement.
His ideal is a ''democratic socialist'' all-Ireland republic.
''However, as a realist and a democrat, I recognise and accept that the
majority of Irish people still have to be convinced about that
particular option.
''I am not an absolutist and neither am I afraid of the concept of
democratic compromise.''
In 1995, John Mitchel McLaughlin has come into his own. With 30 years
of militant republican politics behind him, he has programmed himself to
respond to even the most difficult questioning. After a year of peace in
Northern Ireland his words are currently speaking louder than the guns
of the IRA.
''Sooner or later, the unionists and the British will work with us,
we're absolutely rock solid on that,'' he said earlier this year.
In his eyes a deal on new political structures for Ireland can be
agreed within five years whether the IRA returns to violence or not.
Mitchel McLaughlin seems set to play an even more significant role in
the future of the Irish republican movement than he was done in the
past.

THE problem with William Buchanan is that he has worked hard all his
life, and by managing his finances carefully he has paid for his house
and put a bit by for his retirement. So when the roof leaks, the
electrical wiring is condemned, and the refrigerator packs up, it is
largely up to him to pay for repairs and replacements. On combined state
benefits of #150 a week, that is impossible.
If Mr Buchanan had frittered away his earnings on drink or gambling,
or if he had opted to be unemployed, he believes he would have no more
money worries -- the welfare state would see him right. As it is, he
depends on the generosity of his son's family to keep his home going,
and he believes that is unfair.
''Because I've made the best of what I have, I get refused a lot of
help when things go wrong,'' he says. ''And yet there are wasters who
con the social security out of thousands. It doesn't seem right,
somehow.''
It is a familiar refrain among elderly people discovering gaps in the
social security system that they always assumed would care for them in
their twilight years.
Mr Buchanan, aged 84, a widower for 30 years, is a typical case. A
self-employed haulauge contractor with his own lorry, he created a
moderately successful business which paid for a semi-detached villa in
the East End of Glasgow, gave his two children a decent start in life,
and left a small nest-egg for his old age. He faced retirement secure in
the knowledge that he was self-sufficient and would never be a burden to
anyone -- or so he thought.
His troubles began two years ago when rain began pouring in through
the roof of his house. None of the aid agencies was prepared to
contribute towards the #1400 repair bill, which was more than Mr
Buchanan's savings, so his family paid it.
At the beginning of this year, flickering lights signalled a serious
electrical problem which required rewiring his house at a cost of #2400.
The city housing department eventually paid almost half of the amount in
the form of a home-improvement grant, but the Benefits Agency refused to
provide the remainder. It said that in view of Mr Buchanan's ''personal
circumstances'', his case did not have a high enough priority to qualify
for a loan or grant. Again, his family came to the rescue.
The last blow fell a few weeks ago when his refrigerator broke down.
He paid #30 to have it repaired, but within a few days it failed again.
His daughter-in-law provided a new one.
''You reap what you sew,'' he says. ''I was good to them and now
they're good to me. I'm lucky to have them, and it's fortunate they're
in a position to help, but it seems wrong that they should have to.
''I served my country like everybody else, I did everything I was
supposed to, I paid my national insurance regularly, and now they tell
me they can't help me get a light in the house.''
What would become of him if his family was not there to rally round?
Mr Buchanan considers the question carefully. ''I'd be a poor soul,'' he
concludes. ''I'd be without a fridge, I'd have no light, and I'd have
rain pouring into the bathroom.''
Welfare workers have advised him to mortgage his house through a bank
to meet such expenditures, and assured him that aid agencies would pay
the interest charges on the loan. But Mr Buchanan has never been in debt
in his life, and he does not intend to start borrowing now. Others have
suggested privately that he sell his house, blow the lot on a world
cruise, and come back with no visible means of support which would
qualify him for a free home and all manner of benefits.
''Sometimes they turn round and say what do you want to live in a big
house like this for? What do they want me to live in, a tent? This house
has been my home for 40 years.''
Mr Buchanan is not a grumpy old man moaning about being short-changed
by the country he fought for (and endured two years in a POW camp) in
the Second World War. He reckons he is fairly well off in still having
his house, his pride, and the support of a caring family. But he wonders
at the priorities of a society which offers barely subsistence support
to people like himself, while providing fully-furnished homes and a
range of benefits for pregnant teenagers.
Fortunately, Mr Buchanan's social expenditures are modest. He neither
drinks nor smokes, and his only ''extravagance'' is a #40 annual
membership of a bowling club. He has been unable to play since suffering
a second heart attack last year, but he enjoys going along to watch his
pals. Otherwise, he spends hours watching snooker and football videos.
Now that his home has been repaired, he has only one problem: ''I'd
just like to pay my family back. It'll take a while, but I'll save it up
somehow.''

Tokyo
THE strongest typhoon to hit the Tokyo region since the Second World
War swept along the eastern Japan coast today, killing up to nine people
and injuring scores of others.
However rescue authorities counted themselves lucky that the winds of
up to 125mph and a deluge of rain that went on for hours did not cause
more havoc in the country's most densely populated area.
The casualty and damage toll was not greater because Typhoon Oscar
only flirted with the coastline and did not cross the land with its most
powerful winds.
The typhoon lashed Tokyo for several hours, causing massive transport
chaos as all airports were shut, and trains were either cancelled or ran
at reduced speed.
''The typhoon is the most powerful to hit Japan in the post-war era,''
said the Kyodo news service.
Police said three people were confirmed dead in accidents connected
with the typhoon on land and six people were missing and feared dead in
incidents at sea.
In the worst incident a bus overturned on an expressway in a Tokyo
suburb, killing the driver and injuring 28 passengers.
By evening Tokyo was calm and rain-free as the typhoon lost strength
and headed north-east into the Pacific.
SAN JUAN: A weakened Hurricane Marilyn churned north toward the open
waters of the Atlantic today, leaving four dead and hundreds homeless
after devastating the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.
Officials said some 70% to 80% of buildings on St Croix and St Thomas
in the Virgin Islands were damaged. US emergency officials said a
five-storey apartment complex on St Thomas was damaged but had been
evacuated before the storm hit.
Marilyn was the third big storm to hit the Caribbean in a month,
following on the heels of Hurricanes Iris and Luis.
President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands
disaster areas.
MEXICO CITY: Hurricane Ismael, which battered Mexico's north-western
state of Sinaloa last week, has left 38 people dead and made 5000
homeless.
Most of the dead were around the town of Los Mochis. Damage was
estimated at up to #500m.
The Mexican navy has sent eight ships, three helicopters, and a plane
to scour the coastline for victims and missing boats after fishermen
reported seeing waves up to 27ft high.--Reuter.

Abu Dhabi
A YOUNG Filipina maid who could face a firing squad in the United Arab
Emirates for murder was in good spirits today and hoped that she would
be pardoned.
''Sarah was smiling when I walked in and she said she still had hope
that she would be pardoned,'' said Grace Escalante, consul at the
Philippine embassy, after visiting 16-year-old Sarah Balabagan in prison
in the oasis town of Al-Ain.
Yesterday, Sarah was led sobbing from an Islamic court which condemned
her to death for the premeditated murder of her Gulf Arab employer,
Almas Mohammed al-Baloushi.
It rejected her plea that she stabbed him 34 times in self-defence
after he raped her.
''Sarah said she felt weak after hearing the verdict. She was
expecting an acquittal. But then she said 'I am confident I will get a
break soon','' said assistant labour attache Carmalita Arriola.
The verdict shocked Filipinos at home and in the Gulf.
Philippine officials said they would boost efforts to win Sarah's
release as her lawyer, Muhammed al-Amin, said he expected a protracted
legal battle in his appeal to have her acquitted.
UAE President Sheikh Zaid Bin Sultan al-Nahayan ordered a retrial
after the same Islamic court convicted Sarah of manslaughter and jailed
her for seven years in June. It also concluded that she had been raped
and awarded her compensation.
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said yesterday that he would
personally intervene to save Sarah, who was 15 at the time of the
killing.
Embassy officials said they would appeal to Sheikh Zaid for a pardon
if the appeals process failed.
Al-Amin said that he would file an appeal tomorrow and planned to
prove to a new panel of judges that she was raped despite the retrial
court's rejection of the claim.
''Sarah's biggest hope is that she was raped. The retrial court said
she was not raped but it did not produce a motive for the killing
whatsoever. She is innocent,'' he said.
The verdict has ignited rage in the Philippines, which is still
angered by the execution by Singapore in March of a Filipina maid. Fleur
Contemplacion was hailed as a heroine in her homeland despite confessing
to double murder.
Sarah, meanwhile, sought to tell relatives in the Philippines not to
lose hope.
''We promised to bring a mobile phone during the next visit. She said
she wants to call her aunt to assure her that everything is OK,'' said
Arriola.
ORLANDO: The maid of a Saudi Arabian princess is seeking compensation
from the Saudi Government after claiming that the princess falsely
accused her of theft, then beat her in a Disney World hotel room.
Naima Abakr, 32, a native of Eritrea, sought help from Florida police
after the attack and was treated at an Orlando hospital.
She claimed her employer, Princess Maha Al-Sudairi, a relative of King
Fahd, struck her face and kicked her ribs on September 5, when the
princess discovered that some of her jewels and cash were missing from a
hotel room trunk.
Abakr's lawyer said the maid's boyfriend had admitted stealing from
the princess but had returned all the cash and jewels.--Reuter.

Bruce McKain analyses the debate within the Scottish legal system over
standards of prosecution in the High Court
THE Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, is an admirer of the
present system of prosecuting in the High Court of Justiciary, which
deals with the most serious crimes such as murder and rape.
As he is in charge of the prosecution service perhaps that should not
come as too much of a surprise. But there are those within the legal
system, including some judges, who observe High Court trials day-in and
day-out and consider Lord Rodger's assessment to be somewhat wide of the
mark.
They are sometimes far from impressed by the standard of prosecution
by the Crown who too often are struggling to match the court craft of
experienced defence counsel -- the part-time amateur against the crafty
old pro.
Frequently too, the job of defence counsel is made easier by the huge
caseload faced by advocates-depute, which puts them under severe
pressure to negotiate pleas to reduced charges.
There are currently 13 advocates-depute, literally deputies of the
Lord Advocate, who prosecute in the High Court.
They are chosen personally by the Lord Advocate and headed by a Home
Depute, who gets #45,956 compared with the #42,384 paid to the other 12
deputes.
This is a far cry from the money being earned by successful counsel in
private practice, but a spell as an advocate-depute is seen as an
essential career step for anyone with ambitions to be a judge.
Advocates-depute are selected exclusively from practising members of
the Scottish Bar and normally serve for a period of three years. In
theory the job is part-time, but the criminal courts are now so busy
that it is extremely difficult for High Court prosecutors to keep up any
meaningful civil practice.
It has been said of the present set-up: ''The ethos of the whole
prosecution service is that it is the duty of the Crown always to put
the legal and factual position fairly before the court.
''The Lord Advocate believes that this guiding principle is enhanced
by the practice of appointing a small team of advocates-depute, chosen
for their personal qualities of independence of mind and a certain
degree of experience in either or both civil or criminal practice.
''That practice constitutes a unique and valuable safeguard of the
ethics of independence in the prosecution system.''
There is now growing pressure for change which has led to a
consultation paper by Lord Rodger and the setting-up of a small working
party headed by the Solicitor General, Mr Donald Mackay QC, which is
expected to report by the end of the year.
The consultation paper comes up with three options -- no change in the
present system, solicitor advocates as members of the current team of
deputes, or solicitor-advocates prosecuting as ad hoc deputes at
specific High Court sittings.
The catalyst for change is the Law Reform (Miscellaneous) Provisions
Act 1990 which deprived advocates of the exclusive right to appear in
the High Court.
The Act created a new legal hybrid -- the solicitor-advocate -- who
can plead in the High Court and Court of Session as well as in district
and sheriff courts.
There are now more than 50 solicitor-advocates with rights of audience
in the High Court. Twelve of them are in the procurator fiscal service
which already conducts the vast majority of prosecutions in Scotland
which take place in the lower courts.
The question now is whether the solicitor-advocates should be allowed
to prosecute, as well as defend in the High Court.
Most of the fiscals qualified as solicitor-advocates in the belief
that they would be allowed to prosecute in the High Court, and there are
those who think they would make a better fist of it than an advocate
plucked straight from the civil bar.
The Crown Office consultation paper however, expresses reservations
about the idea.
It says: ''It could be argued that the mere fact that the law on
rights of audience has been changed should not lead to any change in the
present system. The argument in favour of such a stance is that the
existing approach has served the country well and should not be changed.
''It may be further argued that an essential feature of the (present)
system is that advocates-depute are chosen from counsel who are in
ordinary private practice, to which they will return after about three
years, and, because they are involved in prosecuting for only a
relatively short period, they do not run the risk of developing a
narrow-minded approach to prosecution.
''Their decisions are accordingly likely to reflect the proper
approach to the Crown's duty.''
The paper concedes that it does not necessarily follow that a
solicitor-advocate who has made a career in the procurator fiscal
service would be ''incapable of bringing to the position of
advocate-depute the qualities demanded by the Lord Advocate'' but the
tone of the paper has apparently angered some fiscals.
That reaction is echoed by Edinburgh solicitor-advocate Alistair Duff,
a former procurator fiscal, who told The Herald that he regarded some of
the statements in the consultation paper as an insult to the fiscal
service.
''There is a suggestion that because fiscals are involved in
prosecuting on a full-time basis, because they deal directly with the
police in their normal work, that somehow they lose an independence of
mind and impartiality which it is said advocates have.
''I think that's a disgraceful slur on the integrity of fiscals who
are well capable of exercising independence of judgment in prosecuting
cases.
''The author of this paper is somebody very high up in Crown Office,
if not the Lord Advocate himself. To suggest that fiscals are incapable
of exercising proper independence, but that counsel can, is
disgraceful.''
Duff thinks the way forward is to have a blend in the High Court of
advocates chosen basically in accordance with the present system and
solicitor-advocates including people from the ranks of the fiscal
service.
''It's worth remembering that the vast percentage of criminal
prosecutions in Scotland are initiated and prosecuted by fiscals. It's
only a tiny minority of cases that end up in the High Court. So,
obviously, fiscals have vast experience of prosecuting.
''To suggest that the current system has served us well and is perfect
is a long way short of being correct.
''And to suggest that fiscals can't exercise appropriate levels of
judgment in the High Court when they are thought to be well capable of
exercising it in the sheriff court dealing with indictment cases where
you can be sentenced for up to three years, is ridiculous.
''The type of fiscal who is a solicitor-advocate will normally be
someone who is very senior anyway because that's built into the system.
You can't be a solicitor-advocate unless you've got a reaonsable amount
of experience.
''If by having a blend of different types of prosecutor doing the same
job you end up with the most experienced and best-equipped lawyers
prosecuting, that can only be an improvement.''

She has a penchant for fun, giggles a lot and is an excellent mimic.
But Gillian Shephard's fast upward spiral owes a great deal to ability,
instinct for conciliation, and sure-footed shrewdness.
THERE is a spasmodic giddiness about Gillian Shephard which only
serves to confirm a woman in control, someone whose authority is so
commanding no squeal of giggles can dislodge it.
This is a serious person, and on one of her departmental tables a
framed cartoon jocularly nudges home the message. A man, engrossed in a
newspaper carrying the headline, Forty eight hour week, is confronted by
his wife who announces: ''I've checked with Gillian and she says it's OK
for you to mow the lawn . . . ''
Tenacity of purpose, then, has not stunted Mrs Shephard's penchant for
fun. She is, they say, a quite exceptional mimic, and during
conversation she laughs in a swoopingly melodic way which suggests
someone with a singer's training.
Margaret Thatcher learned the tricks of vocal timbre through elocution
lessons. Gillian Shephard acquired hers with the Bach Choir while an
undergraduate at Oxford.
And anyone who saw those photographs of John Major's Downing Street
garden party, held after the leadership triumph, can't have failed to
notice that the only figure not wearing a tribal, navy-blue suit was
that petite one at the centre of rollicking mirth. It might even have
been Gillian Shephard who cracked the Cabinet joke.
But will that indelicate leak last week now damage Shephard's standing
in government, or secure her pivotal role ? She insists that the memo, a
working draft criticising government policy, bore no resemblance to the
presentation she made at Chequers on Thursday. Nevertheless, it did
contain evidence of serious conflict, for in it she apparently warned
that education provision was being threatened by under-funding. ''The
government is politically exposed on education'' the memo said.
''The need to improve standards must not be overshadowed by arguments
about the mechanics through which education is delivered.'' This passage
has been widely interpreted as an attack on the priority given to the
opt-out campaign which John Major revived last Tuesday. But the fact is
that no matter how much the memo is now dismissed by the Tories, the
Education Secretary has sensed the mood of the country far more
accurately than the Prime Minister, and this will prove her surest
defence.
Yellowing now, that cartoon on the table dates from her earliest
Cabinet days in 1992 when she became Secretary of State for Employment.
There followed the Agriculture portfolio, and then, last year, the move
to Education.
Now, as a result of fealty to a mostly beleaguered Premier she heads
the newly formed power bloc of Education and Employment, also hanging on
to other responsibilities as Minister for women.
''Come and see the view from this window,'' she urges. ''Of all the
Government offices this, I think, is the very best. Look, Westminster
Abbey, the House of Commons, Big Ben, and over there, when the leaves
are off the trees, and just to the side of that Italian tower, you can
spot the Thames winding across the city. Brilliant.''
She is 55-years-old, 5ft 2ins, and much more winsomely elfin than
press snapshots allow, which means that those who describe her physical
similarities to Thatcher and Edwina Currie are widely off the mark.
Shephard is stylish without the over-groomed contrivance of the first;
the brutal colour contrasts of the second. Today she is wearing a plain,
long, slightly fitted jacket in powder blue with a short, matching skirt
and black, sling-back shoes. Her legs are bare, showing off a holiday
tan, and she curls one up beneath her on the chair cushion as we talk.
The gaudy, controversial gift of extra duties she received after the
leadership battle was not just excessive gratitude on the Prime
Minister's part.
Shephard's fast, upward spiral through Government departments owes a
great deal to classy ability, an instinct for conciliation rather than
attack, a shrewdness at drawing out constituency opinion, yet
effectively winning almost everything she wants.
Too sure-footed to become submerged in the swamplands of Commons
mediocrity, she obviously unsettles equally ambitious but less clever
politicians. There are men who mutter about her empire-building as if
such expansionist manoeuvres played no part in male game-plans.
''John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, found her after a piece of
his remit,'' says one observer. ''She was Agriculture Minister then, and
she fancied that everything rural should be in her Department.''
If she and Gummer did indeed have a dust-up over fresh air and green
belt economics, it is lost in history now, for she, at least, speaks
only praise of him, reflecting recently that: ''He is a great friend
who's been a terrific support since I've been in the House.''
And she added that, not only was he one of the wittiest men in
Parliament, he did a rather good impersonation of her. Equally, friends
confide that she does a ''simply hilarious Gummer'', and is also known
for her ''crushingly funny Heseltine''.
Such gleeful insights into a person of gravitas are interesting
because of Shephard's inevitable dubbing as Iron Lady Mark Two. But
no-one used to speak about Mrs Thatcher's sense of humour while
colleagues often mention Gill Shephard's roguish put-downs.
There are, of course, some superficial likenesses: Thatcher in her
time was also boss of Education. Both women come from thrifty, lower
middle-class families rooted in small business. Both went to grammar
schools and gained Oxford degrees. Both married supportive spouses
significantly older and less known than themselves.
''I just don't believe this thing about my being like Margaret
Thatcher,'' Shephard insists. ''She was the Iron Lady and I am so
different. But I must say she was very charming and encouraging to me,
although I was always in awe of her. She was such a remarkable woman and
already a legend by the time I got here.''
But if it is impossible not to compare House of Commons women with
each other because their very scarcity makes them conspicuous, then
Shephard herself is happy to throw in her two pence worth. Earlier this
year she described herself as ''the primary school head'' to Virginia
Bottomley's ''sexy nurse'', offering the flinty aside: ''She looks so
sweet, don't you think?''
While Virginia is now settling into the softer verges of National
Heritage, Gillian's name crops up continually in those identity parades
to detect a future Prime Minister. Certainly, she fights her corner and
-- as the German agricultural minister discovered over his boycott of
British beef -- she is not averse to volcanic bouts of temper. But her
political foes doubt if Shephard has the sustained strength to slug it
out when Treasury obstacles are really stacked against her.
She, on the other hand, says: ''One has to give as good as one gets.
Westminster is that sort of place. But what I've always found is that if
you plug away with fact and argument, then people normally respond.
Otherwise they do sound very silly.''
So would she like to lead the Tories one day? Does she covet No. 10?
''Oh heavens,'' she protests, ''I've got quite enough on as it is, and
I'm sufficiently elderly to feel very satisfied with the tasks I've been
given.''
As she says this the voice cavorts into an almost operatic chuckle.
But the answer, even so, is not entirely a denial. Despite what that
leaked memo might imply, her loyalty to John Major is indisputable. She
ranks high among his ''East Anglia mafia'' and she was among those who,
early on, noted his potential, later playing a key role in his first
leadership campaign.
Yet it is significant that, even before John Redwood officially
declared his challenge to the Prime Minister, Shephard was one Minister
who had implied an interest in the job should it become vacant.
Of course, that word vacant is the important one. She would never push
the man described by some as her ''great buddy'', but Shephard might
very well run for the office if he decided to quit. In this respect it
is interesting that she is now emerging as the ameliorative Tory of
post-Thatcherism.
Where previously there was combat -- the Government flak-jacketed
against doctors, lawyers, teachers, the very professions once considered
its allies -- there is now, in Shephard's modulated tones, the hint of a
mediation strategy unfolding. Is this a pre-Election sedative? Nowhere
was the smile offensive more evident than in Shephard's defusing of
teacher insurrection over the national curriculum.
What we saw was not the panicked yet autocratic John Patten, her
predecessor, but someone leading by consultation. It was typical of
Shephard that, when faced with mounting rebellion, she announced on her
first day in office that she wished to meet teachers and parents as soon
as possible, to talk through their fears.
This was precisely how she had operated in Norfolk when she was deputy
leader of the Conservative group and chaired the education and social
services committees before entering Parliament in 1987.
She has long recognised, then, that some government policy can only be
implemented step by step. Shephard doesn't force things through but aims
for gradual persuasion. ''I have come in at a time when we are
consolidating what's been gained''she says. '' Clearly you've got to
press on with reforms -- improving standards, the opting out, the
testing... All those things are very important. But I have also
co-incided with our saying that the national curriculum wouldn't have
any more changes for the next five years. It happens that this is a
comfortable phase for me.'' Her colleagues, on the other hand, were much
more comfortable with reform and revolution. ''That was their task.''
Married to a former comprehensive headmaster, and a former teacher
herselfShephard understands the profession and its wariness of change.
She speaks its language, acknowledging that staff have genuinely felt
threatened because they considered the reforms were moving '' too far
and too fast''. And in contrast to many right-wingers, she does not
believe teachers are inadequate subversives who fail in their duty to
the nation's children.
''I don't think it is possibly to find a more committed group than
teachers. They never stop talking or thinking about teaching, even in
the holidays, so they're not always very easy to live with. But I have
to say that what I have seen this year in the Eduction Deprtment gives
me enormous optimism.
'' Given that the Government is not present in every classroom but
teachers are, you must be aware of their concerns if you want reforms to
take place. It's important. They are the people who deliver. That
doesn't mean anything other than being perfectly firm but listening
carefully.'' This positive relationship is crucial, she stresses, if
there is to be good understanding on both sides.
Largely because of her family background -- her father was a Norfolk
livestock dealer and she still takes pride in her ability to judge
horses and cattle -- Shephard describes herself as ''a dry'' on economic
policy.
''I grew up learning that you can't spend a pound until you've earned
it, and it's a lot better if you don't spend it at all. I also believe
in lower taxation because that gives people morechoice in their
spending. However, I do think there are some functions of the State
which are vitally important, and one of them is education.
'' People's self-esteem is rooted in being well educated and feeling
able to cope. You can take any amount of time trying to make good
deficiencies in people's upbringing but the very best thing you can do
is to equip them with the means of getting themselves out of a hole.''
Such self-sufficiency, she maintains, begins withwith nursery
education.''That's terribly important. The emphasis on standards ( at
every level ) is the thing that really matters. There is also the
question of our cultural and artistic heritage which must be handed on.
So, education is a function of the State which you simply cannot do
without it, and it is a very worthwhile investment. We must be literate,
we must be numerate, and we're not there yet. There is still a long way
to go.''
As Minister for Women she also argues that the general credibility of
politics would be enhanced substantially by an increase in women MPs.
''There are hundreds of women now doing terrifically well in local
government and we need to see that translated into national politics
because women do make very efficient Members -- good on detail and on
following up cases. They operate well in a team and they're very
conscientious constituency workers.''
What has held them back in every party, of course, is the fraught
business of selection.''I have all kinds of tales about how badly women
have been treated by committees. One was asked if her husband knew she
had come for the interview. Another if she didn't think she was too
short -- that could have been me. As it happened it wasn't, but would
they have asked that question of a minuscule chap?
'' It is inconceivable to me that a man would be treated so'' she
says, the voice exploding in a crescendo of protest.'' I know of another
woman who presented herself as a candidate and was introduced as: Mrs X
is 53, divorced, and she and her present husband have nine children
between them.''
Gillian Shephard's anger at such recollections subsides into peals of
laughter as she remembers that the second and third women in these
anecdotes did eventually make it Parliament.
''The first gave up and is now in the House of Lords. But the
important point is that women do things differently. What turns the
public off politicians is seeing them exchanging insults and brawling.
I'm afraid that kind of debate is something lots of men do rather well.
Women are less good at it. They're less confrontational but excellent
communicators, and I'm sure the electorate appreciates that.''
Shephard has no children of her own but she is the step-mother to the
two sons of Tom Shephard, the widowed teacher she married when she was
35.
''Yes, I am a workaholic and it's very boring for those with whom I
live, but I'm afraid I do enjoy work, and at present I spend almost all
my time doing it.''
Even so, the bereft nature of Margaret Thatcher's retirement is a
warning about the need to nourish an interior life, and Shephard is
careful to be at home with her family as much as possible.
Careful, also, to maintain friendships with Oxford pals from 30-odd
years ago. She does the weekend shopping, cooking, and gardening. She
also keeps up with her reading, and her music-making by playing the
piano. A modern languages graduate, she speaks fluent French and German
-- another reason why Brussels took her seriously -- and enjoys
Continental holidays as an upfront Europhile.
''For whatever reason I shall be moving out of here some day,'' she
says of her splendid ministerial suite perched high in Sanctuary
Buildings on Great Smith Street. ''One has to keep reminding oneself
that politics is a very impermanent life. But I love it, and I hope I
might be left here until the Election, then afterwards -- who knows?''
Thatcher's idiosyncratic grip on Downing Street made nonsense of the
old theory that patriarchies are repressive, matriarchies indulgent. If
anything, her endlessly hectoring style did much to harm the furtherance
of women in public life.
Gillian Shephard's tongue is feisty when required but her knack of
appeasement while still not losing ground indicates that the tactics of
the definitive Iron Lady are being wheeled into the archives.
So, even if she is much too canny to proclaim it, Shephard does
symbolise the new Conservative woman. No more patent leather handbags
held at arm's length by the handles. No more imperiously raging
powder-puffed cheeks. The hats went long ago, of course.
But, at least, the tea parties remain. And all those exemplary
sandwiches and cakes.

Hong Kong
EXIT polls released as the voting closed in Hong Kong's historic
Legislative Council elections today pointed to a victory for the
democracy camp despite a new warning broadside from China.
The polls indicated that the pro-Beijing lobby faces humiliation in
the race to elect all 60 seats in the council for the first time, and
probably the last, in Hong Kong's 150 years of British colonial rule.
Both the leader and the deputy of the main pro-Beijing party stood to
lose, the exit polls predicted.
Within an hour of the polling stations opening their doors, China
renewed its vow to dismantle the chamber when it resumed sovereignty of
the colony at midnight on June 30, 1997.
Governor Chris Patten immediately derided Beijing's comments, and
received a sneering response from one of China's top representatives in
Hong Kong.
''It seems to me to be an astonishing way to try to win the hearts and
minds in Hong Kong to say, at the moment when the people in Hong Kong
are taking part in the most credible and democratic election in our
history, that you're going to give the whole thing the thumbs-down,''
said Mr Patten.
The bickering failed to deter voters, who turned out in record
numbers: although owing to an expanded electorate, the percentage was
lower than in the 1991 partial polls.
The battle for what was once scorned as nothing more than a colonial
rubber stamp was a ferocious one as the pro-democracy lobby and the
pro-Beijing camp slugged it out for power, and perhaps political
survival, in the countdown to 1997.
China's renewed threat to kill off the Legislative Council less than
halfway through its normal four-year term may have damaged the
pro-Beijing lobby's chances.
''Nobody likes to be pushed around or bullied,'' said political
scientist Michael DeGolyer.
Mr Patten denounced China's latest threat to annul the election,
renewed shortly after polling stations opened, as ''characteristically
unhelpful''.
Beijing ''should get a little more into tune with what people in Hong
Kong think and do'', he said.
However a deputy director of the Xinhua office in Hong Kong dismissed
Patten's remarks as ''laughable''.
Zheng Junsheng told reporters the governor should feel ashamed of
himself because it was his fault that China could not recognise the
elections.
The Patten reforms which so infuriated China swept away appointed
members, lowered the voting age to 18 from 21, and gave working people a
second ballot.
Though modest in scope, they represented a considerable advance for a
politically cocooned Hong Kong used to watching the governor, the civil
service, and a handful of business leaders and professional worthies
appointed to the Legislative Council determine policy.
Yet China, to the surprise of many, did not demand a boycott of the
polls. It urged ''patriotic'' people to take part and pro-Beijing
candidates are contesting many seats..--Reuter/AP.

MOTORISTS were warned not to be complacent about car security
yesterday after a survey showed a marked fall in the cost of theft from
cars.
The study by windscreen repair specialists Autoglass suggests that
alarm systems, and insurance discounts for security conscious drivers,
have helped the total repair bill fall from #700m last year to #504m
this year.
However, four in 10 ''smash and grabs'' involve German vehicles, as
thieves target more expensive models in the hope of finding richer
pickings.
An Autoglass spokesman said: ''Crooks feel the drivers will have more
expensive items lying around the back seat or in the glovebox.
''Motorists can take simple steps simply by not leaving anything in
the car when it is not in use.''
The survey found that, in the last year, thieves stole 672,000 car
stereos, 270,000 bags, and 137,000 car phones. In all, 834,000 thefts
from cars were reported but Autoglass estimates that 411,000 may have
gone unreported.
Overall, reported thefts from cars in car parks and town centres fell
to 36% of the total. However, the number of thefts from driveways or the
street outside the owner's home has increased from just less than 40%
last year to more than half of all thefts this year.
Autoglass managing director Gary Lubner said: ''It's a relief for
everyone that crooks are on the run.
''But if we drop our guard, they'll be back. It shows that, perhaps,
we are not as vigilant at home as we should be.''
The survey also revealed that more and more motorists were abandoning
security for their cars and becoming complacent.
Some of those interviewed claimed there is little danger of becoming
victims while others believed alarms and devices would not prevent the
determined thief.
Four in 10 motorists admitted not taking any measures to prevent car
crime -- twice as many as a similar survey a year earlier.
Only one in five said they planned to take security measures compared
with three times as many 12 months ago.
Six in 10 believed car alarms were not effective and one in four
claimed they are too expensive.
The survey also found that owners with cars worth between #5000 and
10,000 were the most careful with security.
While 40% of thefts were from German makes, just 17% were from Fords,
11% from Vauxhalls, the same from Japanese models, 8% from French cars,
and only 7% from Rovers.

Durban
A BRITISH tourist who talked her assailant out of raping her while two
friends were reportedly gang-raped nearby, was today praised for her
courage.
Three women, two Britons and a New Zealander, were touring South
Africa in a hire car with Newcastle-based medical student Dino Druda
when all four were abducted at gunpoint by eight men.
They were dragged from the car and 21-year-old Mr Druda was stripped
and dumped in the boot after being pistol whipped. Two of the women were
also forced to strip and were raped and beaten.
However 20-year-old Joane Horscroft, from Barnes, south London,
persuaded the gang member who took her aside not to rape her by telling
him that his mother would be ashamed of him.
Pat Goss, chairman of the Natal Parks Board, who arranged for his
private plane to fly the party to Durban to be interviewed by police,
hailed Miss Horscroft's quick thinking.
''What she did was absolutely miraculous. The man led her away as his
claimed victim and when they were apart from the other men, she said:
'If you have a sister, is this the sort of thing you would want to
happen to her?' ''
''The man then said he would not have sex with her unless she
consented and loved him, but she said, 'How on earth do you expect me to
love you after five minutes?' ''
Her abductor then pretended to have sex with her in order to deflect
the attentions of his fellow assailants.
Mr Goss said: ''He is the fellow we want to catch first. He could give
valuable evidence because he is much less guilty than the others.''
A South African police spokeswoman said: ''It was magnificent of her
to keep a cool head under circumstances like that.''
The ordeal began on Thursday night when the black men, travelling in a
pick-up truck, opened fire on the tourists' rented vehicle after they
asked directions.
The travellers crashed after being chased down a track. Their car and
possessions were stolen and they were forced to walk naked to a nearby
village to raise the alarm.
The mother of the British woman who was raped today spoke of her
relief that her daughter was still alive and had spoken to her on the
telephone.
''I can't wait to see her again so I can put my arms round her and
reassure her that everything is going to all right,'' she said.
The British consul in Durban, Jamie Waterton, suggested the tourists
might leave South Africa soon. ''They have had a terrible ordeal. They
are upset and want to go home as soon as possible.''
South African police said that they were continuing their search for
the gang.
A reward of 100,000 rand (#17,500) has been put up by the South
African Government.
The victims were still recovering today at the home of a friend and
colleague of Mr Goss, who said the local community was shocked by what
had happened. ''These fellows are all absolute thugs. What they have
done to these people is beyond our comprehension and we are all
ashamed.''
South African government officials sought to limit any damage the
attack had caused to the country's tourism industry.
''Unfortunate and sad as it is, it is not characteristic of tourism in
South Africa in general,'' said Dawie de Villiers, Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism.
''For 99% of the tourists who come here, South Africa is as safe as
New York or any other major venue.''

<HEADLINE>Scots students bound for Boston. New university scholarships will offer a taste of big business culture in America.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN SMITH</BYLINE>

STUDENTS at a Scottish university are to be given financial help from
Scottish-based businesses so they can spend six months learning
entrepreneurial skills in Boston.
It is hoped the students, from Caledonian University in Glasgow, will
discern the secrets of entrepreneurship so they can help Scottish
businesses grow.
The new scholarship will place students at North Eastern University in
Boston, which is particularly strong in economics and business.
Dr Brian Fraser, senior deputy principal at Caledonian, explained:
''The benefits are to strengthen our links with a very prestigious
university and to give our students an opportunity to get across there
and experience the working ethos in New England.
''We are keen to get our young folk exposed to the enterprise culture
which flourishes over there and it is in keeping with the present
thinking at Caledonian, where we have a new department of
entrepreneurial studies thanks to financial help from Scottish
Enterprise.''
SE has already carried out extensive surveys on why Scots appear to be
less keen to set up in business than people in other countries,
particularly America. Suggested reasons include a lack of equity to put
into the business and a greater fear of failure.
It is argued there is less stigma in America to people starting a
business that fails, and business people there see nothing wrong with
going on to other, more successful enterprises after initial failure. In
Scotland, it is argued, people are less willing to bounce back after
business setbacks.
Far fewer people leaving university in Scotland, it is claimed, would
consider setting up in business compared to US students. Support for the
scholarship has come from British Airways, United Distillers, and the
Government's Scottish Trade International. Students from Boston will
also spend time at Caledonian University.
The scholarship will be launched in Boston next week when Scottish
Industry Minister George Kynoch accompanies a trade mission to the area
organised by the Scottish Council Development and Industry.
Mr Kynoch says the US continues to be an important market for Scottish
firms with sustained growth in exports over the last two years.
''In 1993, for example, Scottish manufactured exports to the US
reached #1400m and indications are that this growth will continue,'' he
stated.
The Scottish Council, an independent organisation seeking to improve
Scotland's economy, has mounted more than 260 trade missions since 1960.
Officials became concerned that the Department of Trade and Industry was
willing to give financial assistance only to trade missions to the
developing economies, mainly in Asia, which ignored the fact that
France, Germany, and the US were still Scotland's largest export
markets.
However, help has come from the Royal Bank of Scotland and from
Scottish Trade International to mount missions in America and Europe
over the next three years.
Twenty six companies will be represented in Boston, including
textiles, engineering, and seafood firms, who will be meeting US
companies who have already shown an interest in taking part in
''matchmaking sessions'' to see if they can do business.
Although immediate orders are unlikely from such trips, it is
estimated millions of pounds worth of future business can often come
from such contacts.
* The feel-good factor may not be apparent in the country but the
nation's students believe they will get well-paid jobs after graduating.
They also believe they will earn an average #12,300 in their first job.
Despite this optimism, most say they would rather be propping up the
bar than in the library studying.
The survey, in the October issue of Cosmopolitan, showed 80% believed
they would get permanent jobs within six months of graduating and 12%
thought their chances of a career were excellent. Only 4% thought they
had no chance of jobs.
None of the undergraduates thought they could earn #30,000 straight
away.
Only four in 10 students have avoided debt and the rest owe an average
#800, with 75% having to work to pay off debt while still studying.

It is drummed into everyone that the best way
to get ahead is to get a degree . . . but does
that maxim still hold? Alaina Macdonald, who
has an honours degree in politics yet is working in a shop, begs to
differ
TAKE it from one who knows, as degrees become ever more plentiful in
supply, the demand for them is fast declining. Demand these days is for
a far more scarce commodity -- experience.
As I scour the papers for a job I begin to fear that all I am
qualified for is a job behind the check-out at Tesco's. Well call me
picky, I don't care, but I didn't spend four years in the flat from hell
and totally broke only to fill my days stacking shelves, surely? Yet any
job that actually appeals to me requires experience, which I don't have
much of. This leaves me in a bit of a catch-22 situation, that is, how I
get a job without experience or how can I gain experience without a job?
This is a tricky one which some of you employers out there might wish to
consider for a few minutes.
Of course, there are a few extremely annoying, organised individuals
around who managed to single-handedly run the student newspaper, union
and radio, in between socialising and visiting the library. They have
managed to acquire experience of a sort, but there is a more serious
excuse other than plain laziness for those who do not manage to take
part in these campus activities.
One friend has found her grant has been cut by #400 while her rent and
living expenses go up all the time. She is forced to work late nights in
a restaurant in order to eat. Currently going into her final year she is
worried about finding time to study, let alone participating in
voluntary activities.
Having graduated I could gain this priceless experience by
volunteering my services for nothing. However, unless you have some cash
saved (I have four student loans to pay off) doing this probably means
you will also have to eat nothing while you wait for the social services
to sort out your housing benefit.
My old flat-mate had to wait four months before receiving any housing
benefit, during which time she was expected to live off #35 a week in
income support, and pay rent, also #35 a week.
In the end I find myself temporarily back living with my parents.
Ironic really, considering I went to university in order to gain a
one-way ticket out of suburbia, via my degree. It's not a degree you
need nowadays kid, it's experience -- they don't tell you that in the
educational supplements.

ITALIAN pianist Giampaolo Stuani last night won the #10,000 first
prize, the gold medal, and the BT trophy in the fourth BT Scottish
International Piano Competition finals, held in Glasgow's Royal Concert
Hall, for his performance of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto with the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
Stuani, 30, had been confidently predicted as winner since he caused a
sensation with his performance in the semi-finals on Friday night.
Second place, and the Scottish Mutual Assurance prize of #5000, went
to Britain's Charles Owen. The Cambridge-born pianist also won a
Scottish Arts Council prize for the best performance of the mandatory
commissioned work, by composer Frank Spedding.
Originally it had been intended to have a joint third prize of #2000
each to the other two finalists but the jury decided to create third and
fourth places and amended the prizes accordingly.
The third prize of #3000, given by Scottish Amicable, went to
Russian-born Swede Maria Rostotsky, who will be 20 on Wednesday.
American Lori Kaufman picked up the fourth prize of #1000.
Last night's four finalists were chosen from a dozen semi-finalists by
a jury chaired by Dr Philip Ledger and containing such distinguished
pianists as John Lill and Seta Tanyel.
As in previous years, the winner is likely to find additional work
coming his way following the competition.

Meanwhile, Unison, the public service union, claimed today that
business people were occupying too many places in NHS trusts in Scotland
and called for more appointments to be made from local communities,
writes CHRISTOPHER REEKIE.
Its criticism came only 13 months after Mr Ian Lang, the then Scottish
Secretary, tried to reduce complaints about the selection of largely
Tory nominees to serve on quangos by appointing a committee to advise
him on all appointments to NHS trusts and health boards.
Unison is seeking a meeting with the committee and wants a radical
overhaul of the composition of trusts. It published a survey which
showed business people made up more than one-third of all non-executive
directors of Scotland's 47 trusts and 15 health boards.
The total of 323 appointees included 114 (35%) who were employed as
business managers, accountants, management consultants, company
directors, and chief executives.
The next highest group was 56 retired people (17%), many of whom were
ex-business people. Then there were 30 medical staff (9%) and 22
housewives (7%). Only eight (2%) of the appointees were elected local
councillors.
Mr Matt Smith, Unison Scottish secretary, said the survey exposed the
lack of democracy in Scotland and showed the triumph of private interest
over public service.
He said more than #4000m in taxpayers' money was being spent by people
who were completely unrepresentative of local interests.
He intends to draw the matter to the attention of Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the 72 new appointments in the past
year included only 20 business people. The others were 15 from the
caring services, 12 from local authorities, nine doctors, seven
academics, four from the churches, and five others.

<HEADLINE>Fresh calls for ban on bull bars after BBC tests</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976322859</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT Ministers were facing new calls today for the banning of
bull bars on four-wheel-drive vehicles.
New tests by the BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog are said to show how
dangerous bull bars can be when vehicles are involved in accidents.
Research shows that nine out of 10 children would survive if hit by a
car travelling at 20mph and without bull bars, according to Watchdog.
All would almost certainly be killed if knocked down by a vehicle with
bull bars and travelling at just 12mph.
Bull bars, designed to fend off wild animals in places such as the
Australian Outback, have become popular as trendy accessories in Britain
in recent years, amid controversy over the damage they can do.
A senior official at the Transport Research Laboratory tells Watchdog
tonight that many safety features on modern cars are rendered useless if
the vehicle is fitted with bull bars.
''Fitting a strong steel bull bar across the front of a vehicle makes
it harder and makes the car stop more violently and the accident more
severe for the occupants,'' Mr Graham Lawrence tells Watchdog.
''It has the effect of cancelling all the improvements that have been
built in over the last 10 years into modern cars.''
Police will also tell the programme of the effects bull bars can have
in an accident. The programme highlights the case of a Newcastle
teenager who suffered devastating injuries when struck by a vehicle
fitted with bull bars and travelling at less than 30mph.
The surgeon who treated Ian Farnworth, 17, tells Watchdog that he had
never seen such a severe pattern of injuries in a pedestrian struck by a
vehicle at that speed.
Several viewers rang Watchdog suggesting that Anneka Rice could remove
bull bars from the vehicle she uses in Challenge Anneka, currently
screened on BBC1 on Sundays.
However, Challenge Anneka producer Tom Gutteridge said the bull bars
on her Dakkar four-wheel-drive vehicle could not be removed because they
were part of the chassis.
He added: ''All aspects of the Challenge Anneka programme have been
cleared by a qualified health and safety consultant and the vehicle is
used only for filming. At all other times, it is transported on a
trailer.''

ABOUT 90 buildings in Glasgow have been showing the public an aspect
many never see -- the inside.
Yesterday was the culmination of Doors Open Day 1995, an event which
began on September 3 and in which about 580 buildings across Scotland
take part.
The buildings included The Herald office in Albion Street, Queen's
Park Synagogue, the police museum in Pitt Street (described as ''not
entirely suitable for children under 14''), the sewage pumping station
in Partick, and Alexander Greek Thomson's house at Holmwood, Netherlee
-- closed to the public for many years until it was acquired by the
National Trust for Scotland recently.
The event, staged by the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was part
of the annual European Heritage Days programme involving more than 20
countries. It is now in its sixth year in Scotland.
Around 100,000 publicity leaflets had been distributed and organisers
were expecting that attendances, which have risen 10% every year, would
follow the same pattern.
If the outstanding success at The Herald office is anything to go by,
their hopes will prove to be justified. The intention in Albion Street
had been to run three tours of the ''sleek, still modern looking opaque
glass, vitrolite, and metal 1930s design building raised on functional
concrete pillars''. However, such was the demand that another three
tours had to be organised at short notice.
Mr Robert Stevenson, building services manager, said 280 people had
been shown round The Herald office. ''It would have been 500 but we had
to turn people away. We hope to open on two days next year and to
accommodate them then.''

EUROPEAN Union finance ministers are expected today to agree on
legislation imposing punishments on banks which overcharge customers or
take too long in sending money across EU borders.
The move comes despite fierce opposition from banks who have been
accused of double-charging customers who send money abroad -- by
imposing costs on accounts in both country of origin and receipt -- and
routinely taking about one-quarter of the sums in transfer charges.
European Commission investigations have shown that British banks are
among the worst offenders in overcharging for monetary transfers. The
Commission reported last year that customers who paid extra for express
transfers usually wasted their money because routine transfers were
moved just as quickly.
Britain's Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, will support a Swedish
suggestion that the cut-off point above which the new laws will cease to
apply should be Ecu 50,000 (#37,500). Diplomats believe agreement should
now be a formality after months of dispute about limits for the
transactions involved.
Spain, holder of the EU presidency, has produced a compromise set of
figures. If necessary, a decision can be taken by a qualified majority.
The proposed directive is meant to protect small businesses and
consumers. Some diplomats predict the agreed figure will be about Ecu
25,000 (#18,750).
The new rules will also make banks provide more information about the
cost of transferring money across EU borders. It will make banks liable
for a limited amount of money lost in transit and impose penalties for
delays.
The European Commission's main aim in bringing forward legislation is
to increase competition, it said.

A SCHOOLGIRL yesterday was reliving the moment she discovered her best
friend's butchered body. The murdered girl's older boyfriend spoke of
how they planned to resume their relationship.
Fifteen-year-old Emma Jones stumbled upon Naomi Smith minutes after a
killer had struck, slitting her throat from ear to ear and sexually
mutilating her body.
Emma, 15, from Ansley Common, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, where Naomi
Smith lived, courageously offered to attend a news conference and speak
of her friend and her awful discovery.
She and freckle-faced Naomi were described as ''inseparable'' by their
headmaster and Emma told police she wanted to help the hunt for the
savage knifeman by speaking to the public through the media.
Naomi had left home just before 10pm on Thursday to post a letter for
her mother but did not return.
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss told a news conference on
Saturday that Naomi had been ''mutilated'' during a frenzied attack
yards from her family home on the Bretts Hall estate in Ansley Common.
He said: ''I believe it is right and proper to reveal the extent of
Naomi's injuries so that those who may have mixed loyalties about
whether to come forward with information do so.
''She suffered a massive wound to her throat caused by at least four
or five blows from a sharp instrument. Considerable violent force was
used and her throat was cut almost from ear to ear.
''Her mother and father and friends saw her at the scene and I think I
can tell you that her genitalia were severely damaged. This may suggest
that a weapon or instrument was used to inflict these injuries.''
Meanwhile, Naomi's 23-year-old boyfriend spoke of how they were about
to be reconciled on the day she was murdered. Mr Richard Mason, a night
shift shelf-stacker at the local Asda superstore, said he spoke to Naomi
just hours before her death.
Mr Mason, of Meadow Road, Hartshill, Warwickshire, said: ''We had been
going out together for about a month but it began getting a bit too
serious and intense so we decided to cool it -- but we were still
friends and still saw one another.
''I saw Naomi as I was walking to work at about 8pm on Thursday night.
She was just coming back from band practice in Nuneaton. I think her mum
had picked her up.
''I was walking along the road and she shouted at me. I thought 'who's
that' and then saw her running across to me. We just stood and talked
and then I went off.''
Mr Mason said he and his teenage girlfriend had decided they would go
to the cinema to seal their reconciliation.
He said: ''She had told me she wanted to see Batman Forever so I
thought we could go along as a sort of get-back-together. She was happy
about us seeing one another again. She was always a happy person.
''When we would go out, we would just hang around with friends and she
would come and watch me play football.
''I met her when I was playing football on the 'rec'. Naomi just came
over and began talking to me and that's how it all started. She was a
total stranger but she was so friendly. Then we started being together
as girlfriend and boyfriend.
''At first, we saw one another every day but her parents were a bit
wary so we called if off. Her mum and dad came round and they seemed
happy that Naomi was happy.''
Mr Mason, who lives with his parents less than a mile from where Naomi
lived and was killed, said police had spoken to him about her death and
he had told them he was at work at the time she was murdered.
Asked what he would like to see happen to the person who killed his
girlfriend, he said: ''I can't describe what I feel. First of all, I
want to see him caught. I've got my own thoughts on what should be done
to him but I'm keeping them to myself.
''I think whoever did this must have known Naomi and must have lived
locally to know where the 'rec' is.''
* Youth leaders who knew Naomi Smith offered prayers for her and her
family yesterday at an informal church service in Ansley, Warwickshire,
about two miles from where she lived.
A congregation of 30 was in the sandstone St Laurence church, built in
1110, to hear Mrs Catherine Jasper, wife of the vicar, the Rev James
Jasper, speak at the morning family service.
After singing the hymn Trust And Obey, Mrs Jasper said the ''horrific
murder of Naomi'' showed the Devil's influence was always in society and
said: ''It is happening all around us.''
Youth club leaders David and Marie Cove, of Nuthurst Crescent, Ansley,
said they had known Naomi briefly since she attended their group, which
met at local church halls and on the recreation ground where her body
was discovered.
The group would play games and pray. The couple said Naomi joined one
day during the summer after wandering up to see what they were doing.

<TEXT>
FEMALE executives who are made redundant find new jobs more quickly
than men because they approach the task more practically, a survey
reports today.
They also take redundancy less personally and start job hunting more
quickly, said career consultants DBM.
An analysis of 425 executives who received counselling by the firm in
1994 showed female managers were out of work for an average
ofthree-and-a-half months before finding another job.
However, men were out of work for almost six months and were also more
likely to have to take a salary drop in their new job.
A DBM spokeswoman said: ''We have concluded that women are much more
pragmatic and less hung up with their egos.
''Women tend to come to terms with it more quickly. When you are
looking forward and seeking a new job, the sooner you start, the more
likely you are to reach the finishing line.''
Another factor was that companies were now more willing to consider
women for jobs, even if this did not amount to positive discrimination.
DBM says its findings support Government figures which show the
proportion of women in management and professional occupations had risen
from 25% of the workforce in 1984 to 30% in 1993.

The company's chief executive, Mr Lou Gerstner, in Scotland on a
private visit, will announce that a multilingual customer help centre,
set up on a trial basis earlier this year, is to become permanent, with
an increase in staff.
It will augment IBM's existing Greenock-based helpline for the UK and
Ireland, which employs 120 people.
Staff at IBM's Scottish headquarters yesterday refused to confirm

THE IRA was blamed yesterday for leaving a man with a punctured lung
and in need of 3O stitches after a punishment beating.
He was attacked with a hatchet, an iron bar, and a brick after being
confronted by a masked gang in the bedroom of a house in Lenadoon, West
Belfast.
A woman was forced to watch as five men attacked their victim,
according to the RUC. Other people in the house, including a boy of 13,
were ordered to wait in another room.
The 31-year-old man was ''serious but stable'' in hospital last night.
The West Belfast MP, Dr Joe Hendron, said he was shocked by the
assault and accused the Provisionals of being responsible.
He said: ''The British and Irish governments, political parties, the
people on the street, and all those concerned with the peace process
must point out the hyprocrisy to the republican leadership.
''They talk about the need to carry forward the peace process yet they
carry out savage acts like this.''

A WOMAN is recovering in hospital after her family was killed in a
head-on crash with a chemical tanker.
Mrs Sara Clark, 29, escaped with broken bones after the tanker was in
collision with their car as the family drove to watch a football match.
Her husband Anthony, 41, and sons James, five, and George, one, were
killed.
The accident happened on Saturday on the A103 near West Hanningfield,
Essex, as they travelled to watch Southend United play at home.
An Essex Police official said: ''Mrs Clark is in a state of shock. She
was told about the deaths straight away. She has identified the bodies
and had a chance to say goodbye to her family.''
She added that the Clarks had celebrated James's birthday the day
before.
''Mr Clark was a football fanatic and James was becoming one. He had
paid for James to sponsor a player and James was a member of the Junior
Blues club.''
They were driving to Basildon to drop George off to stay with members
of the family and were planning to go on with Mr Clark's two brothers to
see the match.
Mr Clark, a sales director whose parents live in Billericay, Essex,
comes from a family of Southend United supporters.
The Clarks were ''a very close family'', Mr Clark's brother, Brian,
told police. They had been married for 11 years. ''The whole family is
devastated by this news,'' he said.
Mrs Clark, a keen netball player who helped in the local village
school, was being treated for a fractured arm and breast bone at
Basildon Hospital. The lorry driver, Robert Gear, 39, from Basildon, was
taken to the same hospital suffering from ankle injuries and shock.
Police are investigating the crash, which happened when the lorry is
said to have veered out of control into the path of the Clarks' car.

THE Scottish Office is one of the biggest spending Government
departments when it comes to hiring consultants to advise on
privatisation and market testing, according to the Labour Party.
Public Accounts Committee member, Mr Alan Milburn, MP, says the
Scottish Office has spent nearly #21.5m on hiring consultants since the
Conservatives came to power.
Most of the total went on advice during the sell-off of the country's
two electricity companies.
So far, Mr Milburn has tracked down more than #320m spent by
departments on such outside help and he claims even that figure is
merely the tip of the iceberg.
The Scottish Office total, although one of the largest, was dwarfed by
the #124m spent by the Ministry of Transport, much of which has gone to
consultants drawing up plans for the privatisation of the railways.

A PRIZED work of art, regarded as one of Scotland's most important
this century, now resides in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery
after an anonymous donation.
Romance, an oil on canvas by Cecile Walton, was painted in 1920 and
has been purchased from a private Scottish collection by a female
benefactor who wished to save it for the nation, the gallery said.
The self-portrait shows Cecile Walton, naked in bed, shortly after the
birth of her second son, Edward.
She holds the child close to her as she is tended by a nurse. Her
first child, Gavril, looks on.
Dr Duncan Thomson, keeper of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery,
said he had ''an overwhelming feeling of gratitude that someone out
there should have given this unique vision of motherhood to the
gallery''.
Cecile Walton, regarded by many as Scotland's greatest female artist
this century, was born in 1891 and was a child prodigy, despite little
formal education. She married fellow artist Eric Robertson in 1914 and
both became leading lights in the Edinburgh Group.
They later divorced and she turned away from her art to earn her
living.
Cecile Walton died in 1956. She was the subject of a major
retrospective exhibition at Edinburgh's Talbot Rice Gallery four years
ago.
An expert on Walton and her work, Dr Janice Helland, currently a
visiting fellow at Edinburgh University, said Romance was remarkable in
its own right as well as being one of the very few representations of
birth in Western art.

TRAINS were halted for two hours at a station at the weekend after the

Hot water from the urn, in a mess room beneath the main signal box,

British Rail was forced to suspend services and hundreds of stranded
passengers were eventually ferried in buses to Edge Hill, the next
station along the line.
Mr Keith Lumley of Regional Railways said: ''As a precautionary
measure, we shut down the line to stop the 'failsafe' system from coming
in to operation. That would have turned all the lights to red and frozen
all the points.
''We have no idea what caused the water boiler to explode. Pipes just
burst sometimes. Unfortunately, this one was next to the electronics.''
One passenger at least was unimpressed. ''It's a bloody joke. I
couldn't believe the explanation,'' he said.
''God alone knows what excuse they will come up with next.''

<TEXT>
FIVE Scottish islands have been withdrawn from sale by their owner
after pleas from islanders.
Count Rodin de la Lanne
Mirrlees, a former Queen's Herald, had put five Hebridean islands up
for sale, together with his Austrian castle, French villa, and Paris
flat, to pay-off undisclosed Lloyd's debts, estimated at nearly #2m.
The French-born, Oxford-educated count was a name in around 40
syndicates and also suffered heavy losses in a salmon farming venture.
He has already sold a seven-bedroom house in London's Holland Park, a
flat in Switzerland, and antiques, paintings, and silver to raise around
#1m.
However, the 71-year-old laird, who owns Great Bernera and surrounding
islands in the Outer Hebrides has unsuccessfully had his other assets on
the market for a year to clear the remainder of his Lloyd's debt.
He refused to put Inchdrewer Castle, Banff -- which has been in his
family for more than 400 years -- on the market but only a few months
ago a deal to sell Ratzenegg Castle in Austria, which was for sale at
#500,000, fell through.
Islanders in Great Bernera felt that the count would have to sell the
island.
They feared that the nearby unoccupied islands of Flodday, Little
Bernera, Berisay, Vacasay, and Old Hill, which were on the market for
nearly #500,000, were just a precursor to his departure and forced sale
of Great Bernera.
Now the count, who is also prince of a group of Serbian islands given
to him by his friend, the late King Peter II of Yugoslavia, has decided
to take the Scottish islands off the market.
''I have been so touched by the warmth of the islanders on Great
Bernera, who were so upset because they thought I was going, that I have
decided not sell any of the islands,'' said the count, who lives in a
simple 60-year-old crofthouse.
Godson of the late 11th Duke of Argyll, the count, who was married
only once -- to his nurse for a week -- bought Great Bernera and the
surrounding islands in 1962.
He has even joined a 15-person National Lottery syndicate on Great
Bernera.
''We have had a couple of #10 wins -- but that does not go far among
15 of us. But I guess it offers my best chance of clearing my debts at
the moment -- that or a rich widow,'' he said.

annual conference this year, including at least one speaker taking part
in the debates, as the party continues to stress its cultural and ethnic
diversity.
Party leader Alex Salmond was himself the main speaker at the
Pakistani Social and Cultural Society's lunch in Glasgow yesterday to
mark the recent Pakistan Independence Day.
As Mr Salmond put it: ''I was picking up a few tips for our
Independence Day.''
Until now, many Asian voters in Scotland were seen as natural
supporters of the Labour Party, while a few Asian businessmen have given
their support to the Conservatives. But the SNP feels its message of
self-determination should strike a chord with many ethnic communities.
The party is also keen to show that its form of nationalism has
nothing to do with the tribal violence which has torn apart Bosnia.
The SNP also wants to stress the difference between what it sees as
politics in Scotland and politics at Westminster, where it claims there
is growing xenophobia.

MPs should take a breath test before voting in Parliament, a Liberal
Democrat activist suggested as party grassroot members discussed
sweeping reforms to the Commons.
During talks over the weekend, Mr Erlend Watson, from Orkney, said:
''There are an awful lot of bars at Westminster and there are
accusations, I don't know how accurate, that some MPs vote drunk.
Shouldn't an MP be compos mentis?
''I am not saying that any of them are lunatics, therefore the main
problem is inebriation. I am tempted to suggest a breath test before MPs
go into the division lobbies.''

AN 86-year-old woman suffered injuries to her head and hand during a
''callous and cowardly'' attack by a masked man when she disturbed him
at her Glasgow home.
Mrs Jessie Ogilvie, of Cairnhill Drive, Cardonald, returned from an
afternoon shopping trip to find her front door open and the man in her
house.
The thief, who was wearing a ski mask, pushed her to the ground. He
stole her handbag containing a small sum of money.
Mrs Ogilvie was taken to Southern General Hospital and released after
treatment.
Last night, her grand-daughter, Ann Haldane, said Mrs Ogilvie was
still very shaken. She described the intruder as''pathetic''.
She said Mrs Ogilvie was very independent but added: ''Obviously it's
going to shake her confidence considerably and we are worried about
leaving her on her own now.''
Constable Joe McLaughlan from Govan police station, who is heading the
investigation, described Saturday's attack as particularly ''callous and
cowardly''.
He said: ''In the particular area where Mrs Ogilvie stays, there are a
lot of pensioners, so the culprit may have been targeting old people. It
is a bit alarming.''
Constable McLaughlan appealed for any witnesses to come forward. The
man was between 20 and 22 and around 5ft 8in.

SENIOR members of the Shadow Cabinet yesterday dismissed speculation
of a rift between Labour leader Mr Tony Blair and his deputy, Mr John
Prescott, as pre-conference sniping, following Mr Prescott's reported
anger
at being excluded from a secret strategy meeting last March.
Mr Blair's office, although confirming the meeting took place,
described claims that Mr Prescott is being marginalised from the
leader's inner circle as ''mischief making'' aimed at undermining the
party in the run-up to its annual conference next month.
However, with Mr Blair facing a fresh attack on his leadership from a
former adviser to his predecessor, one Shadow Cabinet member yesterday
conceded the leader was facing difficulties.
Dr John Wells, a Cambridge economist who served as economic adviser to
the late Labour leader, Mr John Smith, attacked the party's economic
policy as a ''great deceit on the British public'' and accused Mr Blair
of being dishonest for refusing to detail his taxation plans.
The March meeting, involving Mr Blair and a number of senior advisers,
took place at the Hampshire country house of Mr Christopher Powell,
chief executive of the advertising agency Boase Masimi Pollit and the
brother of Mr Blair's chief of staff, Mr Jonathan Powell.
The meeting was intended to introduce Mr Powell to Mr Blair as part of
BMP's bid to become Labour's advertising agency. The firm was
subsequently awarded the contract.
Others present included Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, press
secretary Alastair Campbell, Hartlepool MP Peter Mandelson, and party
general secretary Tom Sawyer.
Mr Prescott claims there was no significance to his absence. In a
statement, he said: ''This meeting was about economic policy and there
is no reason why such a meeting should not have taken place. Any attempt
to say otherwise is purely mischievous.''
A Shadow Cabinet source insisted yesterday there was no sign of
difficulties between Mr Prescott and Mr Blair and suggested it was
foolish to expect Mr Prescott to attend every strategy meeting with the
leader's team of advisers.
The source pointed to Mr Prescott's close support for Mr Blair in his
campaign to change Clause 4, culminating in the party's landmark special
conference last April -- after the Hampshire meeting.
However, the source added, ''things are more difficult for Tony Blair
at the moment. You'd expect them to be. You can't expect there to be
smooth passage at all times.''
Over the past month, the Labour leader has seen his previously tight
grip on party discipline weakened by a succession of attacks on his
policies and style from disgruntled members of the traditional left.
Last week, his appearance at the TUC conference was dogged by the leak
of an internal party memo suggesting Labour was not yet ready for
government. On Thursday, front bencher Kevin McNamara resigned in
protest at Mr Blair's Northern Ireland policy.
The latest attack appears in the current issue of the left-wing
magazine Red Pepper. Dr Wells said the party was wrong to refuse to
commit to raising taxes and added that its criticisms of Tory tax
increases only limited its room for manoeuvre if it came to power.
He accused the party of being so ultra-orthodox on monetary policy it
was to the right of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, and suggested there had
to be ''grave doubts'' over the party's ability to deliver its
objectives of growth and full employment given its lack of detailed
policies.
''Surely, with Labour so far ahead in the opinion polls, its leaders
should have the courage now to confront the nation with the true
dimension of our economic predicament and argue the case for higher
taxes,'' he said.
* An NOP poll for the Sunday Times shows Labour's lead over the
Conservatives has narrowed. It puts Labour 26 points ahead of the
Tories, a drop of three points since last month: Labour was down one
point to 53%, while the Tories were up two points on 27%. The Liberal
Democrats remained unchanged on 17%.

THE social work specialist who introduced the first community service
orders to Scotland 18 years ago yesterday claimed that proposals by the
Scottish Secretary to toughen up the orders and put offenders into
distinctive uniforms could damage the criminal justice system.
Mr Paul Morron, assistant director of social work at Strathclyde
region, added that it had been Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, while
a Junior Minister in the Scottish Office, who introduced 100% funding
for CSOs following a joint exercise between local authorities, the
Scottish Office, and the judiciary which agreed unanimously on the
nature of CSOs.
''It would be ironic if the Junior Minister partly responsible for
that were now to disturb that equanimity,'' said Mr Morron.
This weekend, the Scottish Secretary said CSOs should involve ''hard
physical work -- not brutality but visible effort, with offenders
clearing up motorways or beaches in protective clothing which advertises
what they are''.
His comments have provoked claims from the Labour Party that Mr
Forsyth is attempting to introduce criminal ''chain gangs'' into
Scotland.
Last night, the chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
Mr Alan Miller, said his organisation also opposed the proposals.
''They are ill-considered and likely to be counter-productive in terms
of the public interest,'' said Mr Miller.
''I know of no lobby or need which has put such a proposal on the
agenda. It seems to me to be more akin with ideology rather than any
perceived need within the present community service order,'' he added.
The former chairman of Strathclyde region's social work committee, the
Rev David Laing, also attacked plans to toughen up CSOs.
Councillor Laing said he had first met Mr Forsyth when, as a Junior
Minister, he visited Glasgow and Port Glasgow to evaluate the CSO
system.
''He pronounced then that he was very satisfied with it as an
alternative form of punishment,'' said the councillor.
Mr Morron, who introduced the first CSOs to Tayside and Glasgow in
1977 and undertook the first national inspection of CSOs on behalf of
the Scottish Office, added that research work carried out by the
University of Stirling had shown that the more valuable the offender
felt the community service was, the less likely he or she was to
re-offend.
''Why change that to a situation when they are more likely to
re-offend? That is not in the public interest nor in the interest of the
criminal justice system in Scotland. It would be tragic if the Secretary
of State were to produce the exact opposite effect than what he
intends,'' said Mr Morron.
That research had also shown that offenders gave the greatest value to
CSOs which helped people less well-off than themselves and which taught
them new skills, he explained.
He added that in the last five or six years, the number of new CSOs
had more than doubled -- indicative of the level of confidence that the
courts and community had in them.
''I think that putting offenders to work of real value to the
community is something that should be warmly welcomed by the public. Why
on earth give a patient medicine, even bitter medicine, when the patient
is perfectly well?'' declared Mr Morron.
* PLANS for a tough new detention regime for young offenders will be
announced today by Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Mr Howard will be joined by Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe and prison
service director-general, Mr Derek Lewis, when he unveils details of the
''high intensity'' regime.
The prison service has been working for months on plans for the
scheme, expected to replicate some features of American-style ''boot
camps'', with firm discipline, long hours, and an emphasis on physical
education.
It has been widely predicted that the first camp will be developed at
Thorn Cross young offenders' institution in Cheshire, housing 60
youngsters. A site in Essex is thought to have been earmarked for a
second camp.
In June, Prime Minister John Major spoke of the need to shock young
offenders out of drifting into crime.
A leaked prison service report in August, however, suggested the
British ''boot camp'' would be less austere than the American version,
with a strong emphasis on rehabilitation, education, and vocational
training.

BACTERIA resistant to antibiotics are sweeping hospitals in England,
forcing wards to close while staff try to control the epidemic.
Elderly patients and people vulnerable to infection after surgery are
most at risk from the super-germs, which cause skin infections and blood
poisoning.
At least 60 people in the West Midlands were killed by a strain of the
bacteria last year.
Eighty hospitals a month are reporting outbreaks and numbers are on
the increase, according to Government health officials.
It is resistant to most antibiotics and hospital chiefs say infection
control is stretched to breaking point.
Public health authority figures show the number of reported outbreaks
doubled last year. A spokeswoman said incidence of the bacterium, known
as MRSA -- methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus -- had been
steadily increasing since it first appeared in the early 1980s.
Having reached epidemic proportions in 1993, it was now a fact of life
in most hospitals, she said.
MRSA is carried by approximately one third of all people, most of whom
never become ill, but the infection can be easily passed on in hospitals
where doctors and nurses are treating patients with open wounds.
At Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, a fresh outbreak forced a
surgical ward to close last week, suspending all new admissions. ''We
believe it came in as a result of patients being transferred from
another hospital,'' said a spokeswoman.
Last year, 183 operations were cancelled and wards were closed for 263
days at Addenbrooke's, largely as a result of MRSA. In 11 hospitals in
the West Midlands, a study identified 346 cases within three months last
year, resulting in an estimated 60 deaths.
Mr David Lingwood, chief executive of Sandwell Healthcare NHS Trust in
West Bromwich, said: ''MRSA is now something we live with. It has
definitely increased over the last two years and it has taken some time
for us to manage it effectively.''

<HEADLINE>Shinty player blinded in one eye. Debate over safety is reopened by the second serious match injury in two weeks.</HEADLINE>

THE debate about safety was last night forced to the top of shinty's
agenda after a leading player was blinded in one eye after being hit by
the ball. The injury to Gordon MacIntyre is the second serious eye
injury suffered by a player in two weeks.
MacIntyre, 28, who plays for Oban Camanachd, took the full force of
the ball in his left eye as he attempted to close down a shot during
Saturday's match at the Dell in Kingussie.
The injury left MacIntyre, who had been capped twice for Scotland,
bleeding heavily from a cut above the eye. He was given treatment by two
paramedics and was able to walk off the field before being taken to
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Two weeks ago, Lee Everett, of Fort Augustus, suffered a similar eye
injury after being hit by the ball while playing for Glengarry on the
first day of the season. Everett is still in Raigmore Hospital although
he is able to see out of the eye.
The injuries have reopened the debate about safety in shinty in
dramatic fashion. At present, players up to the age of 14 can wear
face-guards and helmets while older players have to apply for permission
to use face-guards. As things stand, no senior player wears a
face-guard.
Helmets are permissible at all levels of the game and several players,
including Gordon MacIntyre's brother, Dougie, were wearing them in the
Premier League clash at Kingussie on Saturday.
A helmet would not, however, have prevented MacIntyre suffering the
injury as the ball struck him well below the line of its protection.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron said the whole shinty
community hoped he would make as full a recovery as possible.
He said the game's administrators continued to monitor all aspects of
safety. ''The issue of face-guards is one which we are just not in a
position to make hard and fast decisions about,'' he said.
''There appears to be the possibility that they can, in fact, cause
injuries and we have only to look at the recent Test match between
England and the West Indies to find a case of a guard causing an injury.
As things stand, I am happy to see faceguards remain as an option for
younger players.''
Scotland's team manager, Donnie Grant, said: ''It is very sad when a
player at any level gets an injury like this but it was a complete
accident, although that does not make it any easier to bear. I will
eventually be looking at a replacement but, meantime, our thoughts are
with him.''
MacIntyre is an electric and electronic engineer, specialising in
hi-tech computer work. His commitment to the sport is legendary. He has
been commuting from Londonderry in Northern Ireland to play for Oban
each weekend. He is also a keen skier and angler.
He is due to take up a new post with his American-based company in
Livingston next Monday.

IT was marvellous news for nearly 300 tenants of the Craigbank housing
scheme in Pollok, Glasgow, last year when they learned that their
tenement flats were to be cured of dampness by replacing leaky, flat
roofs with pitched ones.
But after nearly seven months of the #1.8m contract, the cure has
turned sour with more than 100 tenants claiming their homes have been
damaged by flooding from the exposed roofs as work proceeds.
One tenant, Mrs Marilyn Dixon, 30, of Glentyan Drive, said she
recently had to grab her 11-week-old baby, David, from his cot seconds
before a water-sodden ceiling collapsed in his room.
Mrs Dixon claimed she had to remove pieces of rubble from the baby's
cot after the incident.
Tenants complain that they have had to go on to the roofs of the
tenement blocks themselves to nail tarpaulins to the exposed roofs to
prevent rain coming in.
A video, shot on the roof of one block at night by the tenants' action
group leader, Mr Craig Beaton, 25, shows cavity walls left exposed to
the elements. When it rains, he said, water seeps into houses in a
matter of minutes.
Tenants claim the council has let them down by not requiring the use
of protective tents by the contractors during the re-roofing work.
Mr Beaton, a politics student at Glasgow University, said: ''The
impact of all this varies from carpet damage to the destruction of wall
coverings, and in two cases we've had flats all but destroyed.
''We've got people sitting on bare floorboards, and five and six to a
bedroom because they can't use the rest of the house. It really is quite
a horrendous situation.''
It is also alleged that claims for damages amounting to many thousands
of pounds submitted by tenants five months ago have yet to be settled.
Mr Beaton added that two week ago he and some volunteer helpers spent
three hours nailing tarpaulins on to exposed roofs.
Mr Daniel Gilchrist, 55, of Glenlora Drive, a former tiler and one of
the volunteer helpers, said: ''It's ridiculous that we have to do this
ourselves, but if we don't do it our houses would be destroyed.''
An official of Glasgow District Council said: ''This contract is very
near to completion but there have been a few problems. We're working
very closely with the tenants.
''We've come to an arrangement whereby representatives of the
contractors, tenants representatives, and the clerk of works make
regular inspections, either on a daily basis or on a weekly basis, to
make sure there are no blockages or any areas that are likely to cause
further flooding or water penetration.''

THE toughest public spending round for years was signalled yesterday
as the Government moved to prepare the ground for Budget tax cuts.
For the first time, Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave
committed the Government to a long-term target of reducing spending to
below 40% of Gross Domestic Product.
He warned that tax cuts in the autumn Budget were not guaranteed and
would depend on the Government's ability to find spending reductions to
fund them.
He told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. ''Most of the easy things, if any
of them are easy, have been done,'' he said, adding that Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke had already reduced spending plans by #45bn.
All other areas would be reviewed, he said, although the Government
intended to honour its health, education, and social security spending
commitments.
He reminded Tory back benchers that such spending cuts would be
painful. ''It depends on the will of my colleagues,'' he said, his
warning coming at a time when departmental spending Ministers were
engaged in intense manoeuvring to defend their allocations ahead of the
Budget in November.
Despite his cautionary words, clearly aimed at Tory back benchers
pressing the Prime Minister to deliver a vote-winning reduction in
income tax, Mr Waldegrave agreed that the Budget would be crucial to the
Government's electoral chances.
''I think the judgment is right that the next six months will define
the political battleground and will define whether the Conservatives
have a serious chance at the next election,'' he said.
Continuing his note of caution designed to dampen Tory and market
expectations, Mr Waldegrave said the Government would not abandon its
commitment to long-term fiscal discipline for short-term political
advantage.
''I don't think anybody should accept tax cuts as being under the
belt,'' he said, adding that it depended on a range of economic issues.
Striking a bullish note, he said the Government had to go further in
controlling public spending. The current target to reduce it from 43% to
40% of gross domestic product should be revised to take it below 40%.
''I believe there is no choice. I believe that unless Britain joins
the group which diminishes the burden of public spend as a share of GDP
down below 40% in the long term . . . we are going to be in the slow
economic growth group permanently and we are going to have high
unemployment permanently,'' he said.
Mr Waldegrave was supported by Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine, who echoed the need to reduce spending if taxes were to be
cut. ''I think the Chief Secretary is absolutely right to set these
targets,'' he told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend programme.
He said it was important ''to get down public expenditure in order
that we have room for tax reductions which are a very important part of
stimulating the economy. I will back the Chancellor as will my
colleagues in searching for all proper and responsible economies
consistent with the delivery of excellence in the services that the
state must provide.
''If we can do that and at the same time take advantage of the
economic growth and deliver tax cuts, that will be exactly what a
Conservative Government should be doing,'' he said.
Labour said the Government was willing to damage fundamental services
to pay for a politically-motivated tax cut. Shadow Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said: ''We now know that the Government is planning far
deeper cuts in public services and welfare benefits than had previously
been feared. This Government is so desperate to find money for tax cuts
before the election, regardless of the state of the economy, it is
willing to undermine and harm some of the fundamental needs and services
upon which we all depend.''
Meanwhile, Mr Waldegrave also suggested that only if he accepted
criticisms expected to be contained in Sir Richard Scott's final report
on the arms-to-Iraq affair would he resign.
The judge, who has led the investigation into the affair, would have
to show he had done something ''seriously wrong'' for him to consider
quitting and he believed that was ''not the case''. Criticisms of his
conduct contained in a draft of the report leaked to the media were not
well founded, he added.
The draft criticised his role as Foreign Office Minister during the
1980s in efforts to relax Government restrictions on defence sales to
Iraq while publicly maintaining they were unchanged.
Mr Waldegrave said: ''I believe that the criticisms there were not
well founded . . . I didn't actually do the things alleged.''

Thousands of people have combed 200 beaches around the UK for
Beachwatch '95, collecting rubbish and determining whether more debris
comes ashore from the Atlantic and North America or the North Sea and
Europe.
Last year, 14 tons of rubbish was collected under the Beachwatch
programme.
East Beach is one of five in Scotland to come under the scrutiny of

A FISHERMAN drowned and another is missing presumed dead after their
18ft vessel capsized on Saturday night 200 yards from the shore of Vaila
in Shetland.
A third crewman, found by rescuers yesterday after an all-night
search, is recovering in the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick, suffering
from shock and hypothermia. His condition is described as stable.
The search and rescue operation began when relatives of the crew of
the Kes raised the alarm when it failed to return to port.
The surviving crewman, Mr Terry Chapman, who is in his early twenties,
was found around 4am sitting on rocks below cliffs on the south side of
Vaila by a Sea King helicopter from RAF Kinloss.
He swam in the freezing water for several hours in a heavy swell
before struggling ashore.
Later, just before dawn, Aith lifeboat found a body next to the
upturned boat about 150 yards offshore, still tied to the vessel by a
line.
Villagers from the scattered community of Walls were shocked last
night by the double tragedy.
The dead man was named as Mr Trevor Blair, 27, from Kirkidale, Walls,
who leaves a 19-year-old widow, Kay. She is a sister of Mr Chapman's
wife Stacy.
Mr Blair's sister-in-law Jane Peterson described the dead man as
''just great''. She added: ''We are all devastated. His wife Kay has not
slept or eaten since she heard about the missing boat and his
18-month-old daughter, Katherine, is with friends.'' Mr Blair, a
knitwear worker, had been married to Kay for two years.
Missing presumed dead is salmon farmer Leif Einarsson, 33, also from
Kirkidale. Originally from the Faroe Islands, he is married with two
children, Magnie, nine, and Solbjorn, eight.
The search for him was called off as darkness fell and a coastguard
spokesman admitted the chances of finding him alive were now poor.
Villager Jerry Sansom said Mr Einarsson was a born-again Christian
whose whole life was given over to God. ''He was somebody who was full
of life. He was a very enthusiastic person and will be sorely missed.''
Mr Einarsson married Shetland girl Ruth Simmons and the weekend
disaster is the third tragedy to hit her family in the past two years.
Last May, her sister-in-law, Elisabeth Simmons, collapsed and died in
front of her two children on a flight between Aberdeen and Shetland.
Two years ago, Mrs Simmons's father, a travelling evangelist,
collapsed and died while on a foreign holiday with his wife.
Mr Chapman, from New Road, Walls, told his rescuers he felt very lucky
to be alive. He was later visited in hospital by his wife. He has two
children, Luke, two, and Hannah, three.
Local people in Walls said yesterday it appeared the boat had been
overwhelmed by a wave while hauling lines. Weather in the area was fine,
with a moderate south-easterly breeze, good visibility, and little
swell. Police are investigating the cause of the accident.

THE secretary of a social club was stabbed to death as he tried to
foil a raid on the premises early yesterday morning.
Mr Harold Petrie, 46, was found lying 150 yards from the front door of
Inverurie Loco Social Club in Aberdeenshire.
Police believe he died instantly from his wounds.
Minutes beforehis body was found, Mr Petrie's wife Helen had been
attacked by a robber who made off with #5000 from the club safe.
She was not injured in the attack but was suffering from shock and was
being comforted by relatives last night.
The murder scene in the market town was cordoned off yesterday as
police made an extensive search for clues.
The stabbing happened at 2.30am just as the club was closing. It is
understood Mr and Mrs Petrie were last to leave.
Superintendent Ron Coutts, head of Grampian Police CID, said around
200 people had been in the club on Saturday evening.
''Someone must have some detail which can help us trace the person
responsible for this crime,'' he said.
The attacker was described as of medium build, who wore dark clothing
and spoke with a local accent.
Mr Petrie, of Watt Crescent, Inverurie, was described by a relative as
''a quiet, respectable family man''. He had a son and a daughter.
''They were such a nice quiet family. They were ordinary, everyday
folk who would not bother a soul,'' the relative said.
Mr Petrie was well-known in the town through his connections with
sporting clubs. He was chairman of Inverurie Loco's junior football club
and president of the town's indoor bowling club.
Players and officials of the football club placed a bouquet of
flowers, with a club tie attached, beside the police security cordon at
the murder scene.
A large bloodstain was visible underneath a lamppost.
Officials who visited the scene were clearly upset at what had
happened.
One said: ''Everybody connected with the club, all the players and all
the staff, is absolutely devastated. It is a really terrible thing to
happen in a town like this. There could not have been a large amount of
money involved which makes it all the worse.''
Around 80 police officers were in Inverurie yesterday, some carrying
out house-to-house inquiries.
A specialist search team hunted for a murder weapon and clues.
Mr Coutts said Mr Petrie was found in the road by two uniformed
officers who responded to a call from the social club.
A police incident room was set up near the scene. Police said they
were making a minute examination of the cordoned-off area.

PARTY leader Paddy Ashdown yesterday tried to reassure Liberal
Democrat activists gathering in Glasgow for their conference that there
was no growing affinity between his party and Mr Tony Blair's new-look
Labour.
Delegates passed a strategy document which sought to emphasise the
independence and distinctive political agenda of the party.
It said: ''Our opposition to this Conservative Government will not
mean cosying up to the Labour Party.
''No quarter for the Tories, no let-up on Labour. Liberal Democrats
will continue to campaign and win for the principles we believe in.''
With awkward timing, Mr Blair this morning throws open the door to a
new closer relationship with the Liberal Democrats. For the first time
he accepted that the two parties could start working together before the
next General Election.
In an interview with the Times, he emphasised the similarity in
thinking between the two parties, although he accepted that the move
would not be universally welcomed within his own ranks.
''There will be a lot of people who object to what I am saying. But I
think increased co-operation with the Liberal Democrats is sensible.''
Asked whether there could be pre-election discussions on policy, he
replied: ''Yes.''
Mr Ashdown has tried to make sure that there is ''clear blue water''
between the Liberal Democrats and the other main political parties but
there appear to be some elements within his own party -- some at a high
level -- who favour closer ties with Labour, if not a shift to the left,
which he is keen to slap down.
He said yesterday: ''There is not a growing affinity with the Labour
Party because no-one knows where the Labour Party stands. Mr Blair has
been very brave about modernising his party but Labour has been
depressingly timid about what it would do to modernise the country.''
The party president, Mr Robert Maclennan, MP for Caithness and
Sutherland, and the General Election campaign co-ordinator, Lord
(Richard) Holme, also made it clear that the party was not in the
business of coming to any sort of accommodation with Labour.
Lord Holme said: ''We support Liberal Democrat policies and Liberal
Democrat values. We are not linked to one of the other political parties
in any way at all.
''There will be no deals, no electoral pacts with Labour, no sharing
out of winnable seats. We will focus resources on the seats we believe
we can win but we will fight every seat.
''The Government is morally and politically exhausted and,
democratically, it has to go.
''However, it would be wrong to assume that because we want this
Conservative Government out we are some kind of wholly owned subsidiary
of the Labour Party.''
Mr Maclennan hoped it was evident where the Liberal Democrats stood in
relation to the other political parties -- reaffirmed as a ''unique,
independent party with an agenda we present as our own''.
He added: ''We do not, and should not, choose to define ourselves in
relation to other parties. I hope this will put an end to any further
speculation about where we stand in relation to the Tories, or for that
matter Labour.
''In fact, given the direction that Tony Blair has taken, it may
indeed be more pertinent to ask where do Labour now stand in relation to
the Conservatives. Will they complete their political fusion by merging
into one party -- New Tory perhaps?''

<HEADLINE>72-hour reprieve by Nato. Serb guns beat the Sarajevo retreat</HEADLINE>

THE Bosnian Serbs were given another 72 hours to complete the pullout
of their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo last night.
Nato and UN commanders extended the deadline after they found the
Serbs had started the withdrawal.
''Admiral Leighton Smith and I judged that the Bosnian Serbs have
shown initial compliance. Therefore we have agreed that the suspension
of air strikes be extended for an additional 72 hours,'' UN commander
General Bernard Janvier said.
The fragile pause in the conflict had been facing its harshest test
last night, with the deadline on the Sarajevo siege and government
troops advancing on a Serb stronghold.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, in Belgrade, warned that the
country was in a ''dangerous no man's land''.
The assistant US Secretary of State, Mr Richard Holbrooke, who
brokered the peace deal, said: ''The next few days and hours may
determine the fate of the war.''
There was added uncertainty for the peace process with the disclosure
that Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic was ill in
hospital. The hard-line chief was reported to be undergoing treatment
for kidney stones in Belgrade.
As his heavy weapons were on the retreat from Sarajevo, attempting to
ward off a new Nato blitz, his forces were being routed by Muslim and
Croat offensives in western Bosnia, attacks which threaten the
stronghold of Banja Luka.
Last night, a Croatian government Minister, Mr Bosiljko Misetic,
indicated the goal of the offensive could the conquest of the whole of
western Bosnia, including Banja Luka. ''It is absolutely in the interest
of Croatia that the Banja Luka area becomes a part of the (Croat-Muslim)
Bosnian Federation,'' he said.
Meanwhile the convoys from Sarajevo included tanks, howitzers,
mortars, multibarrel rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, and
ammunition.
Bosnian radio said the government had been told by the UN that the
Serbs had withdrawn 150 of their big guns.
''I feel like crying,'' yelled one Bosnian Serb soldier from the top
of a departing tank.
0 However, with most eyes on Sarajevo, there was a growing danger of
an escalating war at Banja Luka. The UN's main concern was that the
government's rapid advance on the Serb stronghold could drag Serbia
itself into the war.
If the Bosnian army attacked Banja Luka, choked with tens of thousands
of Serb refugees, there would be great pressure in Belgrade on President
Slobodan Milosevic to throw the Yugoslav army into the fray. Russia,
traditional ally of the Serbs, would also find it difficult to remain
silent.
This current advance, and Croatia's rapid victories over Serb forces
in the Krajina, Nato air strikes and the recent run of defeats have all
added to the calls by Serbian nationalists for Mr Milosevic to act.
The Serbian leader encouraged Serb rebellions in Croatia and Bosnia,
but is now under intense criticism from these nationalists at home for
trying to put together a peace deal.
In a startling assault in the past week the Croats and the Bosnian
government have seized a string of Serb-held towns, closing to within 25
miles of Banja Luka. The government army claims to have taken about 1600
square miles in recent fighting.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic confirmed his men had lost towns
and land held by Serbs for centuries. ''We have sustained heavy losses
and lost several towns and territories which have belonged to the
indigenous Serbs for centuries,'' he said. ''We are now trying to form a
new line of defence.''
During talks with the Bosnian Government today and the Croatian
leadership tomorrow, Mr Rifkind will call for a halt to their joint
military offensives. ''We are in a rather dangerous no-man's land with a
genuine interest in negotiation combined with an ongoing conflict on the
ground.''
As these negotiations continued, a huge new refugee drama was
unfolding behind the front lines. Local Bosnian Serb officials said
100,000 refugees were in or near Banja Luka. Roads leading into the city
were choked with people and aid workers were using horses to distribute
food.
Meanwhile the latest convoy to Sarajevo returned to Scotland
yesterday. The chairman of the charity Edinburgh Direct Aid, Dr Denis
Rutovitz, said while conditions were still poor in the city, there was
hope amid the tentative peace.
The convoy, which included East Lothian Labour MP John Home Robertson,
delivered 30 tons of family parcels to nurses, teachers and other
hospital and school staff.
