EURO Disney has made a profit, one year ahead of schedule. In the year to
September 30 the group which operates the Disneyland Paris theme park made a
profit of #15m compared with a loss last year of more than #230m.
This is the first profit since the park opened three years ago. A 20% increase
in attendances to 10.7 million following the decision to lower prices by around
20% helped, as did improved operating cashflow. But the major factor in the
turnaround was last year's financial restructuring package.
Steve Burke, chief operating officer, said the results laid to rest the debate
over whether Paris was the right location for a Disney theme park. ``We have
broken the negative spiral that was in place 18 months ago.'' He added that in
1996 and 1997 the company would move from being troubled to solidly profitable.
During the year, revenues from the theme park rose by 8%, while hotel revenues
grew by 16%. Occupancy levels increased by 8% to 68%, out-performing the
general Parisian market.
The introduction of new rides, such as Space Mountain, helped to attract more
visitors. Since opening in 1992, 6% of all Europeans have visited Euro Disney.
British vistors make up around 10% of the total at 1.1 million.
In future, other off-park leisure activities, such as a multiplex cinema
showing some Disney films, a Planet Hollywood burger bar and convention centre,
are expected to add to the off-peak attraction of the site.
Park admissions account for just over a quarter of the group's revenues, with
hotels and other activities making up the remainder.
Other developments are being contemplated including all-inclusive tours and a
designated Disney train travelling from Waterloo Station in London via the
Channel Tunnel. The company's prime objectives are to encourage repeat visits
and increase the spend per visitor. The Spanish and Germans are the biggest
spenders.
Despite the encouraging results, City analysts still consider the shares
overvalued. Euro Disney will have to make substantially more money to warrant
its stock market price. Many analysts remain concerned about the debt charges
facing it after its debt and management fee holiday is phased out. It still has
a debt mountain of #2000m.
In volatile trading the shares closed in London down 21p at 194p.

Prison hunger
strike record
A PRISONER today will pass the record for the longest jail hunger strike -
after going without food for 386 days.
Idris Belaifa, 42, who blew up his own grocery store in a bungled insurance
fiddle, has amazed doctors by refusing to eat solid food since he was sent to
Walton Jail in Liverpool on October 26 last year. The previous longest recorded
hunger strike was 385 days by Denis Goodwin at Wakefield prison from June 28,
1972 to July 18, 1973.
Argyll honour
SIR Fitzroy Maclean, 84, is to be given the Freedom of Argyll. Argyll and Bute
District Council agreed to bestow the honour on the wartime hero at a meeting
in Lochgilphead yesterday.
Royal birthday
THE Princess Royal's son, Peter Phillips, yesterday celebrated his 18th
birthday with an afternoon of firefighting drills at Gordonstoun School. Staff
said there were no plans for a birthday party.
Driving ban
A FOOTBALLER who admitted drinking and driving was fined #500 at Perth Sheriff
Court yesterday. St Johnstone midfielder Gary Farquhar, 24, was also banned for
15 months.
Ear survey
A MAJOR survey is to be conducted to gauge the success of treatment for ear
problems among children. A postal questionnaire is to be sent to the parents of
1000 youngsters who have recently attended hospital as out-patients or
undergone operations in Scotland.
Fast growth
BRITAIN'S only supplier of genetically altered trees yesterday announced that
it is to create 19 jobs in an #400,000 expansion. Christie Elite Nurseries in
Forres, Moray, sells specially bred Sitka Spruce, which are taller, stronger,
and faster growing than the wild trees.
Whale of a time
CHILDREN at Bressay primary school, Shetland, had an extra nature-study lesson
yesterday when a 40ft minke whale cruised into Lerwick Harbour and spouted a
few hundred yards offshore. Whales are seen rarely in the busy harbour, used by
more than 5000 ships a year.
Bullock on loose
A RAMPAGING bullock brought parts of Edinburgh to a standstill and delayed rail
services between Edinburgh and Glasgow for nearly two hours yesterday. The
animal escaped at about 10.30am from the Gorgie cattle complex and ran amok on
roads in the area, before clambering on to the Edinburgh to Glasgow and Fife
railway. Police marksmen shot it dead.
Deathtrap flat
A MAN who turned his home into an electrified fortress and mounted a spying
campaign on social security officials was sent to a mental hospital for an
indefinite period yesterday. John Commins went 20 years without receiving badly
needed treatment after slipping through the mental health safety net. His
behaviour became increasingly bizarre, culminating in his ``deathtrap'' flat
and an unprovoked stabbing of a supermarket security guard. Snaresbrook Crown
Court in East London heard that Commins, 46, wired each door of his flat to the
power supply.
Phone clue
A BUNGLING thief who left his home number on a farmer's answerphone before
turning up and helping steal his caravan was sentenced to 160 hours community
service at Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday . Mark Charles, 25, of Petershill
Road, Glasgow, phoned Drum Farm at Carronbridge, Stirlingshire after seeing an
advert for the caravan. A few days later, he turned up with a friend and
badgered a farm worker into allowing them to test the van by hitching it to the
back of their car. Then they drove off.

<HEADLINE>Euro-MPs back demands for consumer action Support grows for Shell boycott</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>

<TEXT>
A WORLDWIDE boycott of Shell products was in prospect last night.
Euro-MPs from the major parties threw their support behind a call by Ken Wiwa,
journalist son of the executed Nigerian human-rights campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa,
for consumer action.
Mr Wiwa said in Strasbourg yesterday: ``I would urge consumers to make an
intelligent decision on whether or not to purchase Shell products.
``I will continue to boycott these products as I have done for the past five
years.''
The European Parliament tonight is expected to back sanctions against the
Nigerian regime which receives more Third World aid from Europe than any other
country.
Euro-MPs will be voting on a series of proposed sanctions but they failed
yesterday to agree on a written demand for a consumer boycott or even an oil
embargo.
Party differences proved too strong and led to a weak-worded compromise stating
only that an oil embargo would be ``one of the most effective methods'' of
pressuring Nigeria's military junta. A consumer boycott did not even rate a
formal mention.
However, many senior Euro-MPs said in private they accepted the need for an oil
embargo and expressed their belief that a consumer boycott was now inevitable.
Oil accounts for an estimated 98% of Nigeria's income.
As the assembly debated sanctions against Nigeria, EU ambassadors to Brussels,
including the new British permanent representative, Mr Stephen Wall, were
gathered to plot the freezing out of Nigeria from aid and trade. They were also
expected to stop short of recommending an oil embargo.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Foreign Secretary, will discuss EU action with foreign
ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Nigeria receives #84m a year from the EU under the Lome convention, the world's
biggest trade-aid package, which is worth #12bn over a decade to African,
Caribbean, and Pacific states.
Mr Wiwa, looking exhausted, told reporters he wanted a boycott of Shell as well
as an oil embargo. He urged shoppers, before they decided to buy Shell
products, to consider the fate of his father and eight other human-rights
campaigners hanged by the junta.
He described as ``extraordinary insensitivity'' the decision by Shell to press
ahead in Nigeria with its planned investment in a #2700m liquefied natural gas
project which Labour Euro-MP Mrs Glenys Kinnock described as the biggest
investment in Africa.
``I am absolutely amazed and flabbergasted,'' he said. ``This company does not
care about people.''
Shell is the technical leader of the project which also involves the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Agip of Italy, and Elf of France. The World
Bank's International Financial Corporation arm pulled out last week.
Mr Wiwa's remarks received strong cross-party sympathy as Euro-MPs debated the
executions amid a rising clamour for a total oil embargo and consumer action.
Even British Tories, including Mr Edward McMillan-Scott (York), said they
believed in a consumer boycott.
Mr McMillan-Scott said a boycott would take place on a world-wide scale. ``I
will not be buying Shell products until there is democracy in Nigeria,'' he
said.
However, Lord Plumb, Conservative Euro-leader, was careful to say only that the
issue was worth considering. He ruled out the Tories formally signing a
compromise demanding a boycott but added: ``There will be a strong call for a
boycott of Shell products - there is no doubt about that.''
Mrs Kinnock, who was leading a European campaign to save Mr Saro-Wiwa's life
when news of the hangings broke last week, added: ``I say yes to a boycott of
Shell. It is entirely appropriate for citizens of the European Union to take
this kind of action.''
The European Commission has said it believes EU action against Nigeria should
form part of an international effort under the banner of the United Nations.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN Secretary General, told Euro-MPs this week he
favoured an arms embargo but considered a trade embargo too complicated to work.
The EU takes 39% of Nigeria's oil exports. The United States takes a further
40%.

AS the purchasers of Knoydart Estate continued to keep their identity hidden
yesterday, the chairman of the new Highland Council's land and environment
committee called for greater openness in land deals in Scotland.
Dr Michael Foxley said: ``One idea we will examine is purchasers providing an
audit of their financial standing, to try and get away from the banks
bankrolling unsuitable purchasers. The local community and the local authority
should also be able to consider purchasers' intentions for their new
acquisition.''
Research into the Kinloch Investment Company Limited yesterday revealed the
identity of just one director, Mr Alistair Hall, the Blairgowrie solicitor
acting for the company. He said he would add nothing to a statement being
issued by the Edinburgh-based selling agents Strutt and Parker.
This confirmed that Kinloch's offer had been accepted and that the offer was in
the region of the #1.5m asking price.
The statement concluded: ``Kinloch Investment Company Limited is a company
registered in Scotland and owned by Scots. It is their intention to take over
the estate shortly before Christmas.
``At this early stage, it is their plan to continue to manage the estate along
traditional lines involving red deer stalking, forestry, and other rural
Highland estate enterprises.''
Solicitors acting for the sellers, Jute company Titaghur, travelled to
Blairgowrie to meet Mr Hall yesterday.

NEVER ones to miss a trick, the rugby authorities in Glasgow have now ensured
the rapid promotion of the game in Maryhill with a simple piece of planning.
Scott Kerr, one of the rugby promotion chappies in the area, left his car
unattended and paid the price. It was stolen.
In the boot had been a stock of rugby balls, which were subsequently changing
hands at #1 a time in the bars of Maryhill. ``Ssshhh . . . want a stereo and a
Gilbert size 5?''
Shade Munro was not too displeased at what had happened. ``It was unfortunate
that Scott had his car stolen,'' said the former international second row,
``but if they use the balls, then we are happy.''
The Diary firmly believes that there are vast areas of Scotland that would
benefit from this subterfuge - in fact, the whole of Glasgow for starters.
Leaving cars unattended with their boots crammed full of rugby balls might be
the way to promote the game at the grass roots of society in every country of
the world.
How come the SRU never thought of that then?
q SO Graham Ellis is to become seven-and-a-half grand richer on Saturday, when
he sits on the bench as reserve hooker for Scotland. Five grand retainer, the
balance an appearance fee. It has an odd feel to it, doesn't it?
Mind you, not half as odd as the tale that reached us from one of his
team-mates, which says that when he is staying with representative sides his
wife appears early in the morning to strap him up for the game ahead and then
analyses his play later in the day. At least, that's what she says she's doing.
And I bet Kevin McKenzie, who would probably have been playing, is pretty
scunnered with it all. McKenzie had the medial ligament of his right knee
stretched out of all recognition when Kevin Allan, the Melrose prop, kicked him
on the outside of the joint at the Greenyards on October 7.
The Diary hears that McKenzie will now not play until December, because of the
joint's instability. Now, if it were football.
q THE Diary understands that Peter Phillips was warned by the referee for
over-eager use of the boot on Saturday in Dundee. Was this just another royal
stamping his authority on society?
q THE current presenter of Rugby Special is Mark Souster. A little old lady
approached him at a game and asked where he had come from.
``I was at Sky,'' he said.
``Oh,'' said the old dear. ``Such a lovely place. And what part of Skye do you
come from then?''
q IT was Kenny Milne who pointed out how the crowd at Mansfield Park swells at
half-time. Watching the game on Sunday between Scotland A and Western Samoa,
Milne said: ``Just watch. They all get in free at half-time.''
Sure enough, we witnessed the Mansfield Park crowd grow. Perhaps they had been
nicking rugby balls out the back of cars.
q CONGRATULATIONS to Alec McDougall of Glasgow Southern, who is playing his
500th game for the club on Sunday, an event which will be celebrated with a
dinner on Monday night.
Like many a player, he has graduated from the back row to the middle row, to
the front row. He must be old. I played against him.

TOM Gibson has a mission and he hopes that the message for success is on a
bottle, for he plans to sell whisky galore to the Chinese.
It is the first time anyone has bottled it with a label in their own language -
and in their own country.
The characters on the label, Mei Jing Li mean barley or malt, gold, and
profits, and the first bottle had just rolled off his new plant in Beijing.
Glasgow-based Cathay Atlantic is probably the first Scottish firm to set up a
joint venture company with the Chinese Government.
q A single bottle of late nineteenth century Craigellachie Rare Reserve fetched
#2070 - more than twice that expected - at a Christie's whisky sale in Glasgow
yesterday.
The bottle of Old Highland Malt was bought by United Distillers.A bottle of
Very Fine Glen Grant, ``specially selected and bottled for Mrs Grant of
Lossiemouth'', made #1265.

POSTS in Scottish athletics have all too frequently been filled on the Buggins'
turn principle, with occasional maverick inadequates, incompetents, or simply
unsuitable people in key roles.
Athletes are no angels, but the frequency of outbursts against officialdom, and
even refusal to compete for their country, highlights a problem.
That should end, however, under new proposals likely to be adopted next year,
which call for senior office-bearers - including president, treasurer, and
secretary - to be interviewed.
But the Scottish Athletics Federation anticipated approval yesterday by
revealing that applicants for the job of international team manager will have
to submit a curriculum vitae, and be grilled in competitive interviews.
The job specification (applications close on December 15) demands they
demonstrate the ability, time, and commitment for the job, plus a range of
qualities.
Interviews will be held shortly before the appointment is made on January 17.
The key focus is the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and the successful applicant must
sign a contract with SAF, detailing how either party can terminate the
arrangement.
They must manage all aspects of preparation and finance, liase with the
national and other coaches, and attend a wide range of meetings, including
courses in management skills. The arrogance of some team managers who believed
attendance at these was unnecessary was remarked on in the report following
last year's Commonwealth event.
q A SCOTTISH University Select team will compete in the Barrs Edinburgh to
Glasgow relay on Sunday, the first time such a team has been included in the
eight-stage event. Greenock Glenpark and Irvine are the final teams invited to
complete the line-up, which was reduced to 21 teams following the withdrawal
yesterday of North District Select, victims of the number of veterans in their
line-up who have opted for a Home Countries match in Dublin on Saturday.
q ORGANISERS of the Ronnie Kane Memorial meeting wish to stress that Sunday's
event at King's Park, incorporating a women's league match, is female-only.

EDINBURGH recaptured the Scottish Universities title they last won three
seasons ago with victory in the final at Stirling yesterday, confirming also
that they have the skilful players to survive in the national league division
one, writes Alan Lorimer.
Andy Lucking dominated the lineout and the experienced back row recycled
quality second-phase possession and linked well with the backs. Edinburgh's
five tries were the result of a positive attitude to take the game to St
Andrews with the ball in hand.
Full back Richard Bailes set the tone with a long-range try and Rob Henley
rounded off a splendid passage of continuity rugby with a try converted by
centre James How.
With the wind, they extended their lead with a penalty by How, who converted a
fine try under the posts by centre Mark Mansour from a scissors move, and
further touchdowns by stand-off Piers McWhannel and Mansour.
Edinburgh - R Bailes; K Brennan, M Mansour, J How, captain, P Haslett; P
McWhannel, H Williams; T Cohn, S Roberts, W Mulhall, J Harte, A Lucking, S
Cadzow, R Henley, D Watt.
St Andrews - C Kerin; C Wakefield, P Ainsworth, J Acton, M von Hapsburg; A
Armstrong, M Rennie; D Primrose, N McLaren, captain, A Ravenscroft, N Christie,
P Anderson, M Pickles, P Sanderson, B Crosse.
Referee - N Flower (Strathclyde Police).
q SCOTT Welsh's ankle injury has forced him to withdraw from the South team to
play against Griqualand West at Netherdale tonight.
The selectors have replaced the Hawick stand-off by switching Selkirk's Scott
Nichol to fly-half and calling in Melrose's Jimmy Turnbull at centre.
Turnbull's place among the replacements has yet to be filled. Kick-off is at
7.15.

A SPECIAL Bench of five judges will take time to consider whether a defence
lawyer's incompetence can provide a basis for challenging a conviction under
Scots law.
James Anderson, 43, was jailed for three years and nine months at the High
Court in Glasgow in February last year after being convicted of assault to
severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
He alleges that he suffered a miscarriage of justice because of the
inadequacies of the solicitor advocate who represented him at his trial.
Anderson will have to persuade the court to disapprove of a previous decision
by three judges in 1949 that lack of skill or diligence in the preparation or
conduct of a defence cannot be a ground for claiming a miscarriage of justice.

EDINBURGH Academicals yesterday underlined their ``absolute confidence'' in
coach David Sole, following the SRU's decision to conduct an investigation into
the former Scotland captain's remarks after their Premiership clash with
Melrose on Saturday.
Academicals were plunged deeper into relegation trouble after an injury-time
try by Melrose scrum half Bryan Redpath following a string of nine penalties
awarded by referee Colin Henderson.
Immediately afterwards, Sole declared that the referee's performance had been
``tantamount to cheating,'' and even 24 hours later the 1990 Grand Slam captain
considered that his side had been ``cheated of victory.''
On Monday, the SRU announced that they were conducting an inquiry. Chief
executive Bill Hogg said that he had written to the Academicals seeking an
explanation, adding that Sole's reported remarks were ``totally unacceptable.''
Hogg added that if action is taken against the former Scotland captain then it
would be under the catch-all term, ``bringing the game into disrepute.''
Yesterday, Academicals' spokesman, Edinburgh solicitor Magnus Moodie, declared
that the club's executive committee had met on Tuesday night and had considered
media reports that a letter would be arriving from the SRU. He said: ``Accies
will respectfully consider the letter when it arrives and, having given it due
consideration, will reply privately.
``The executive committee unanimously recorded their continuing absolute
confidence in David Sole as coach, and noted that they saw no reason why that
confidence should be diminished in future.''
Yesterday, Sole preferred to remain silent on the Henderson affair, and was
content to let matters take their course. However, with the backing of his
club, his hand has been strengthened in the event of a showdown with the SRU.
q THE SRU is now, apparently, denying that it is imposing a 72-hour media
silence on international players before and after Test match appearances. The
basis of the denial, reported in some newspapers yesterday, is the fact that
the media will have access to players at the open training session tomorrow
morning and immediately after the game against Western Samoa on Saturday.
This scenario, which indicates a partial return to the status quo, is at
variance with what The Herald, correctly, reported on Tuesday when SRU
marketing manager Laura Dick declared: ``The situation is that a player may not
speak to the media, without our permission, during the 72 hours before and
after a game.''
The conflict within Murrayfield as to what was indeed intended indicates that
wires have become crossed somewhere along the line, which is particularly
unfortunate as the SRU moves into a new era with a public relations company
hired last week to refresh its PR profile.
Yesterday, director of rugby Jim Telfer said that under the terms of the
players' contract - which still remain unsigned - he was keen that players
focused on the game and not be distracted by the media and, in particular, he
was concerned about players who were contracted to write newspaper columns.
``I'm not happy with players writing columns at all and I don't want that to be
part of the scene in the future,'' said Telfer. ``I don't want us to get to the
stage that exists in England, where the likes of Rob Andrew and Brian Moore
have criticised referees, the opposition and, in some cases, team-mates.''
Currently, Craig Chalmers, Rob Wainwright and The Herald's Kenny Logan, are
contracted newspaper columnists. Telfer said that the position of players who
wrote columns would be looked at again at the end of the season but, in the
meantime, he would be happier if columns did not appear on the Saturday of an
international match.
By mutual consent, and even though it contravenes the 72-hour post-match media
ban, Logan's column will appear on Monday, when he will deliver his big match
verdict.

WHAT more could they have done? Leah Betts wasn't a wee keelie left to run
wild. Nor was she a desolate scrap blotting out misery with the aid of
adulterated chemicals. She was just having fun.
Her parents spoke calmly with their four daughters about the dangers of drug
abuse. Paul Betts knew them from first-hand experience as a former drugs squad
officer. Jan Betts, a nurse, advised schools on drug abuse.
They were not unduly heavy nor cringingly liberal. On the night of her 18th
birthday party, when Leah swallowed the ecstasy tablet that left her comatose,
they were in the next room.
They were just ordinary parents who, like most of us, try to do their best in
the hope we can be good enough. And it's that I suspect which has had more
impact, even, than the terrible sight of Leah, hooked up to the tubes and wires
and tapes that keep her hovering this side of death.
Usually when we read reports of hard drugs claiming lives we can tolerate it
because it happens to someone who is other; we can dismiss it, maybe
compassionately, more often now resignedly, as another in the deadly toll of
life in the underclass. Who identifies with the image of someone else's son or
daughter huddled in a tenement stairhead, life snuffed out by an overdose?
Here, though, it happened to the Betts, an ordinary family, living ordinary
lives. Is that why the reaction to one more victim of the drugs culture is so
extraordinary?
Part of me questions the ethics of what has become the ritual of parading
profoundly distressed relatives for the cameras, even when they agree to do it.
The usual nebulous justification from police is that it is done to help solve
crimes through emotional pressure on the perpetrators or those who shield them.
In this case, though, another part of me, a small, frightened part, accepts
that the sense of unease in watching the Betts had more to do with thoughts
about the fragility of life, and the knowledge that one small banal act is all
that stands between my family and your family and what has befallen the Betts.
Ecstasy is an established part of the youth culture of this country. Somewhere
around one million tablets are swallowed every week. Leah bought one for #10 on
her way home from a Saturday job.
It is cheap to mass produce and the raw materials are readily available. So is
the market. Leah's friends who were with her when she collapsed blowing out the
candles on her birthday cake have said it was a birthday party, not a drugs
party.
The difficulty with the message that Leah Bett's fate gives is that while it
may strike fear into the heart of every ordinary parent, it's not clear that it
will do any such thing among those who pop it. For those who use chemicals for
pleasure, one pill does not constitute a drugs binge.
There is an old advertising adage which says that you have to win the
credibility of the people you want to influence. Parading the dangers may shock
but ultimately it does not deter. To be taken seriously any message about the
dangers has to tell the truth. Even if that means telling uncomfortable truths.
There is no point, then, in denying that young people get pleasure from the
drugs. It will be felt as an insult to the intelligence to deny that stark
fact. Ecstasy does not cause death because it's mixed with dog-worming tablets
or baking soda. In some individuals it triggers a serious allergic reaction.
Others are hypersensitive so that a dose is like an overdose. No-one knows when
they take the first tablet how they will react.
Others who take it may not know that allergic reactions can occur without
warning. Others will die from more preventable effects, such as overheating and
dehydration. Many of the 50 young people who have died after taking ecstasy
were, literally, burned out.
Joseph Conrad came near the truth when he wrote that youth was a time when he
felt he could last forever, outlast the sea, the earth, and all men; the
deceitful feeling that lures us on to perils. If we're to have any hope of
helping them avoid the perils we have to make sure the clamour of our own fears
doesn't swamp the messages they hear.

TRYING to second guess the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, is difficult at the best
of times. Trying to do so as he puts the final touches to what is likely to be
the last truly effective Budget before a General Election is doubly difficult.
On a personal level we may expect adjustments to tax allowances and thresholds
but Mr Clarke may well go for broke with a 1p reduction on the basic rate, to
be financed by expenditure cuts, other tax increases or a combination of both.
We will know for sure on November 28.
That said, what is he likely to do for business? Or can business expect to take
second place in a budget designed for the hustings?
Small and medium-sized businesses now play a pre-eminent role in economic
growth and job creation. Various measures have been introduced to encourage
investment in smaller companies, including venture capital trusts, the
enterprise investment scheme and capital gains tax reinvestment relief. We
should expect this theme to continue.
Deregulation is another area under scrutiny. Proportionately it places a much
greater burden on smaller companies. Some progress has been made in aligning
the rules on PAYE and National Insurance. This is welcome and should continue.
We have also seen measures to simplify VAT for smaller companies. Again, more
of this can be expected.
Small businesses would also benefit from measures to assist the financing of
investment from their own earnings. One possibility would be to give 100%
first-year allowances to the first tranche of annual expenditure on plant, say,
up to #200,000 per annum.
A reduction in the 33% standard rate of corporation tax would help the UK
competitively in the international markets but is unlikely. There have been
calls for a reduction in the 25% rate for small companies. But any reduction is
likely to be linked to the basic rate of income tax as the two are normally
kept in line.
There has been lobbying for fiscal incentives to boost innovation. However the
Government's view is that research and development is already assisted through
the tax system. One suggested change is to allow a scheme for R&amp;D tax losses to
be surrendered to the Treasury for payment. The Government appears set against
other incentives but there is a weight of opinion in favour and a change of
mind is possible.
The 10.2% rate of employers' National Insurance contributions is likely to be
reduced. The Chancellor has already promised that the proceeds of the new
landfill tax will be used to reduce employers' NIC.
There is speculation that benefits in kind will be brought within the NIC net.
Most at present are free of NIC and this change would make the regime
completely neutral between salary and benefits and further align the tax and
NIC rules.
However, this would place a considerable financial and compliance burden on
business and Mr Clarke will have to weigh this against the perceived benefits.
A 1% increase in the 17.5% rate of VAT would raise a substantial amount towards
other tax cuts but is likely to prove very unpopular. A widening of the VAT
base to the likes of passenger transport, books, newspapers and children's
clothing is also unlikely. The #46,000 VAT threshold is likely to be raised by
an inflationary factor.
Other technical VAT changes are likely, most notably further amendment to the
anti-avoidance provisions concerning the option to tax property transactions.
Changes introduced last year missed the mark and many innocent transactions
have been caught, particularly lease and leaseback transactions.
Further amendments are likely.
The 2.5% Insurance Premium introduced last year has yielded less than forecast
so an increase is likely. Variable rates are a possibility for different types
of insurance.
An increase in the air passenger duty introduced last year is also possible
with #2 going on the #5 charge on flights to Europe and #5 on the #10 charge on
flights elsewhere overseas.
The introduction of a landfill tax from October 1 has already been announced.
The rates should be announced in the Budget, possibly around #6-#8 a tonne and
#2-#3 for inert waste.
We can confidently expect an increase in road and fuel duties by 5% more than
inflation. This will add to the transport costs for Scottish businesses
shipping goods to markets in Europe and beyond.
In 1994 the Inland Revenue issued proposals to give formal rulings on the tax
treatment of transactions after they occurred. This will enable taxpayers to
obtain comfort on the tax treatment of transactions they have undertaken and
this is seen as an essential element of the new self-assessment regime.
It is therefore likely to be implemented.
Proposals have also been made to extend this to pre transactions rulings -
meaning before the event - for a fee. At present statutory clearance procedures
are available in advance of undertaking certain transactions but in specific
areas. This proposal would widen that process.
Finally, share options. On July 17, Mr Clarke took swift action to withdraw
income tax reliefs on approved share options granted to directors and employees
following publication of the Greenbury Report. His action was more hasty than
swift and he later amended this so that reliefs continued to be available where
the options existed on July 17.
However, this still overlooked the fact that the change had the greatest impact
on lower-paid employees with share options who will not be able to shelter
gains against their annual capital gains tax exemption. For senior employees
with large options this is much less of an issue.
Further changes to the detail of the legislation are likely in the Budget. But
it remains to be seen whether the Chancellor will have a third go at the
fundamental issue, possibly by allowing income tax reliefs to continue but on
much lower amounts of options.
Overall the Budget will probably be primarily aimed at the man in the street.
However, the measures aimed at business will also be closely scrutinised on
November 28.

JONATHAN Davies, who has played only twice for Cardiff since his return to
union from rugby league club Warrington earlier this month, faces an operation
that could scupper his return to Five Nations' Championship action.
Wales' disappointing performance in last Saturday's 19-15 win over Fiji
increased the calls for his return to the national side.
``I think I popped a hernia against Cambridge University,'' said Davies. ``But
having had this sort of injury before, I know the form - which is to rest for a
week before starting light running and then I should be playing again in three
weeks to a month.''

THE unseasonal mild weather has severely damaged recovery
plans at textiles group Dawson International, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Chairman Derek Finlay yesterday warned that profits for the second half of the
year are unlikely to match those of the first six months.
Those showed a decline from #15.8m to #8.4m, or #9m after a reserve clawback,
the City has interpreted that as pointing to a full-year figure of perhaps
#14m. That contrasts with last year's #28.4m after adding back exceptional
costs, but the interim dividend has been held at 1.5p. However, the 3p total is
in no danger.  Dawson shares tumbled 8p to 111p at one point before recovering
to lose 5!sp at  113!sp where they yield 3.4%. There were profit declines in
all divisions with the high profile Pringle in  loss, dragging the UK apparel
operations into a #4.2m shortfall.
Dawson is now paying the price for having too wide a range of Pringle products,
the lack of a cold autumn has devastated demand for knitwear, retailers
remaining fully stocked.  The problem is being addressed by Dawson unexpectedly
selling its surplus into  Poland, Russia, Australia and South America at low
margins to help establish a
more solid pricing base by winter 1996.
A decision has been taken to stop pricing unbranded knitwear although that will
reduce overall volume from the Hawick operations by a third. Altogether the UK
workforce has dropped by 850 to leave a base of about 4500.
Cashmere products encountered very severe resistance to an attempted 25%
increase in retail prices which were required to meet the doubling in wool
costs in 1993 and 1994. That resulted in reduced profitability in the fibres
and yarns division.
The current six months will see a charge of perhaps #6m as surplus stock is
sold off at the Morgan thermal clothing subsidiary in the US. That too has been
hit by the warm autumn but Morgan will benefit from a new distribution centre
and advanced cutting methods. One bonus is that it has about #70m of tax losses
to carry forward which will hold the overall Dawson tax level well below
standard rates for the forseeable future.
There are no liquidity problems, with year-end gearing likely to decline
slightly to about 20%.
Mr Finlay, who was appointed chairman in March, emphasised that it would
probably take two years for Dawson to fully recover but the groundwork and
reorganisation has been put in place.

FEW football teams can claim fans as diehard as Spain's Betis, which boasts a
late club member whose son has remained faithful to the man's final wishes and
takes his ashes to each game - in a used milk carton.
And although the man died last year, the son has also renewed his father's club
membership for this season, which entitles the milk carton containing the ashes
to a seat in the Benito Villamarin stadium, club director Jose Antonio Gonzalez
Flores said.
But not all has been a bed of roses for the dead man - whose identity and that
of the son have not been divulged.
According to the El Mundo newspaper, although the son had no problem renewing
the dead man's membership, he initially tried to take the ashes to games in a
glass container.
After several weeks, however, he was stopped by security officials who claimed
the container constituted a dangerous object and as such was prohibited.
It was then the son got the idea of placing the ashes in a one-litre, used milk
carton, a decision which met with the approval of security officials.
q REAL Madrid chairman Ramon Mendoza has made good recent threats and announced
he will resign next Monday after more than 11 years at the helm - but the
Spanish champions look no closer to ending their crisis.
The club have struggled to overcome a chronic deficit and Mendoza's troubles
came to a head when shareholders rejected the financial accounts last month.
``This board of directors is incapable of throwing me out,'' he said. ``I'm
leaving because I want to ... and because I think it is best for the running of
the club.''
There was no indication that Mendoza's departure might jeopardise Argentine
coach Jorge Valdano's future.

THE pretenders, Eoin Jess and Scott Booth, both scored last night as Scotland
celebrated their qualification for the European Championship finals next
summer, but the old fellow, Ally McCoist, also found the net and later said he
was determined to be around for the big show.
Scotland's manager, Craig Brown, who is entitled to bask in a warming glow of
satisfaction, will not let up between now and the finals. His players, mostly
journeymen, have done him and the nation proud, but they now face a major test
of their ambitions.
``I think we have a job on our hands to get beyond the first stage in the
finals,'' said Brown. ``However, it was important that we qualified, because to
have failed to reach the finals of the World Cup and the European Championship
would have been bad for us all.''
Brown will not be satisfied until he knows his best striking formation. Booth
and Jess will be there at the final reckoning. So, too, might Duncan Ferguson,
but McCoist should not be discounted. ``I know the competition will be fierce,
but I would love the chance to be involved,'' he said.
One of the success of the evening was Scot Gemmill. Watched by his father,
former Scottish internationalist Archie, Gemmill Jr applied some subtle touches
in midfield and also drove forward with style.

SCOTLAND'S Alan Burnett yesterday made it five wins out of five when he ended
English champion David Gray's unbeaten run with a 4-2 victory in the Embassy
IBSF World amateur championship at Q's Club in Bristol.
Burnett, reigning world junior champion, moved into a 2-0 lead over the
Londoner with breaks of 42 and 45. However Gray, at 16 the youngest ever
English champion, replied with 104 in the third frame. Ayrshire teenager
Burnett took the next, only for Gray to knock in an 83 to reduce the deficit to
3-2, but Burnett clinched the qualifying group match with a run of 71.
Alok Kumar, of India, produced the highest break of the tournament so far - a

SWIMMING
COMMONWEALTH Games medallist Fraser Walker, dropped from the Scottish team in
the summer, has ignored the welcome back sign by turning down an invitation to
a two-week training camp in Fort Lauderdale in Florida in February.
The 22-year-old confirmed the selectors' folly when he won the 200 metres
medley at the British National Championships in July, and he further proved
that he is one of our few Olympic prospects with two medals and a Scottish
record at last weekend's Cumbernauld Meet.
But his rejection of a return to the fold is not so much a fit of pique, but
rather a reasoned assessment that the weeks before the Olympic Games trials in
Sheffield in March would be better spent in familiar surroundings.
``We went to Lanzarotte on a Scottish training camp at the start of this year
and a few of us picked up an infection,'' he explained.
``Risking illness at that time next year is just too big a risk. Anyway, I'd
rather take the money.''
Walker, who is training in Warrington, was pleased with his 400 metre medley
victory, and a close second to British team rival James Hickman in the 200m at
Cumbernauld, and reckons he is on course for the Olympics in Atlanta next
summer.
``But I'm certainly not complacent,'' he added.
``There are another four months of tough training to be put in before the
trials.''
Scotland's European Championship medallist Graeme Smith, who completed an
outstanding Cumbernauld Meet with a Scottish record in the 400m free-style,
will also be missing from the Fort Lauderdale camp.
He has opted out of the Scottish programme in recent years, and so did not
merit even an invitation.
However, the Stockport Metro 19-year-old will be heading to Florida at the end
of next month for a two-week training camp with his coach Dave Calleja.

Nine months   1995             1994
Turnover  #5919m       #6378m
Net income   #155m  #269m

THE precipitous decline in British Gas's share of the industrial and
commercial
market came to a halt in the third quarter but the infamous ``take-or-pay''
contracts are starting to bite hard, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Current cost net losses rose from #222m to #274m in the quarter, which was
actually not as bad as feared. But the stock market was disappointed that no
progress had been made on renegotiating the take-or-pay deals.
These long-term arrangements oblige the group to pay for gas at fixed prices,
which are about double present levels, even if it is not needed. So far #83m
has been provided against the contracts and it expects to pay #520m in the
final quarter for supplies not required.
British Gas feels hard done by because half the deals were made before
privatisation and the oil companies needed these bedrock contracts to develop
gas fields. The prices were fixed at a time when British Gas thought it would
have a much longer domestic monopoly. The Government has since moved the
finish
date forward to 1998, with trials beginning next spring.
Because of all this, British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown is looking for
Government support when it comes to renegotiation.
The group said two months ago it wanted to renegotiate but nothing has
happened
yet and substantive talks are not expected before the New Year. The gas
producers are under no obligation to renegotiate and British Gas needs the
Government's support because it grants exploration licences.
Finance director Roy Gardner said: ``Once we get into detailed discussions and
negotiations with producers it may be necessary to seek the aid of the
Minister.''
Once British Gas was able to compete on equal terms to supply the industrial
and commercial market it maintained its share at 35%. While declining share
was
no longer a factor in the third quarter, warm weather was. Excluding this,
chairman Richard Giordano said underlying profitability was marginally ahead
over the first nine months of the year. Actual profits were an eighth lower.
With the mild weather continuing into the final quarter, Mr Giordano expects
full-year earnings before exceptionals to be down on 1994.
British Gas shares slipped 4!sp to 241!sp but the considerable uncertainties
are already discounted given the yield of 7.4% and the shares are coming on to
brokers' buy lists.

THE Daks-Simpson plant at Polbeth, West Lothian, was closed for the second
successive day yesterday as health and safety officials continued to
investigate workers' complaints of feeling ill.
The workforce of 365, mainly women, had returned to work, but only for about an
hour, after having been sent home early on Tuesday when 12 people complained of
dizziness, nausea, and a rash.
Work resumed after a 7.30am meeting but after a later meeting, about half of
the employees left the premises.
The company decided it could not operate with a reduced workforce and all
employees were allowed to go home. They will return to work this morning.
Mr Kevin Johnson, Daks-Simpson managing director in Scotland, said no-one need
go back to work until they had been reassured by the medical team from the
company's sister plant at Larkhall, Lanarkshire.
The factory had been cleaned during Tuesday night and further cleaning and
testing would continue.
The incident at Polbeth came after the company's Larkhall plant was closed for
several days after 40 workers were taken to hospital complaining of
breathlessness and nausea. No reason has been found for the Larkhall outbreak.
The Polbeth plant makes up men's trousers from material handled by the 1700
workers at Larkhall.

A GAME against San Marino would never have been the choice as the last fixture
for Scotland before the old South Stand at Hampden was torn down. And yet, the
fans who were there last night, all 30,306 of them, did see a Scottish team
score five goals, rack-up their fifth successive competitive victory and also
qualify finally for the European Championships in England next summer.
Indeed, the team did all that manager Craig Brown had hoped for.
Before the match, Brown had insisted that he wanted a performance from the
players which would convince the support that they would not be travelling to
the finals in England simply to make up the numbers. He got that.
He also wanted the players to deliver goals for the supporters who had come out
in numbers for the remaining matches, the vital games which had ensured
qualification. He got them.
Five of them, in fact - and two of these in the first half from the strike
force of Eoin Jess and Scott Booth, the men he had started the game with up
front.
Brown had moved Jess back to his original striking position, instead of the
role in which he has been employed by Aberdeen.
That paid off for him.
In fact, before the Pittodrie front player scored the opener after 30 minutes,
he had been close to snatching goals on three other occasions.
Yet, when the goal came, it was thought out, the kind of strike that Brown has
been trying to produce to his team's play.
Pat Nevin reached the byeline on the right, and with a classic cut-back, he
found Jess coming in on goal. The Aberdeen man went down as he shot, but he was
still able to steer the ball beyond the San Marino keeper and into the net.
Just before half-time, it was his Pittodrie partner Booth who struck for the
second goal.
This time, Scot Gemmill was the man who reached the byeline. He sent the ball
across goal, and there was Booth as Gemmill's cross came off the keeper. He
scored from close range, and by now the Scots' superiority had been turned into
the goals Brown had wanted.
Two minutes into the second half, Brown made his first change when skipper Gary
McAllister went off to be replaced by Ally McCoist.
Colin Hendry took over as skipper, and Jess dropped back to his club position
in midfield.
Within two minutes, McCoist had scored, coming on to one of his favourite
grounds and doing what he is so good at.
The Ibrox striker was at the far post to meet a deep cross from Pat Nevin and
headed into goal.
Following that, Billy McKinlay took over from an ineffective John Collins and
Darren Jackson took over from Scott Booth and the changes did not disturb the
fluency of Scotland's play.
In 71 minutes, a fourth goal arrived. A ball was played into the box, McCoist
moved it on, and when the goalkeeper fumbled the ball and sent it away from
goal, Nevin pounced to steer a shot beyond him and into the net.
Then, in the closing minute, a Nevin cross was turned past his own goalkeeper
by Fabio Fracini to complete the scoring.
Inevitably there will be those who point out that the five goals came against
San Marino. Equally, it must be remembered that no one can find it easy these
days to score goals against the minnows of European competitions.
Brown asked his players to entertain the fans, and they did so. He knows that
there are more severe tests to be faced next summer.
However, when you examine Scotland's qualifying record, there is a
professionalism about the performances which will not allow anyone to dismiss
their challenge easily.
Russia, who will be among the favourites to win the tournament, drew twice with
the Scots. The single defeat Brown's men suffered was against Greece in Athens
and that came from a penalty which was fiercely disputed at the time and became
even more controversial when the television re-runs were seen.
They won every other game.
Brown, of course, still seeks the striking partnership he wants up front, and
while Jess and Booth combined well in the first half, and helped themselves to
a goal apiece, he brought McCoist, and later, Darren Jackson, into play.
Before next summer, he will have other games - there is one against Denmark in
Copenhagen in March, and more will follow, and in that time, he must fashion a
strike force to threaten the stronger opposition Scotland will face in the
finals.
Last night, Scot Gemmill emerged as a potent force in midfield. Even though
Brown has stressed continually that the midfield area is his strongest, Gemmill
is now telling him that he deserves the opportunity to play in more important
games than this one.
There is no doubt he will be given that opportunity. He was outstanding against
San Marino, comfortable in possession, aggressive when necessary, and with
skills you could match with those of any other midfield player at Brown's
disposal.
SCOTLAND - Leighton, McLaren, Boyd, Calderwood, Hendry, Gemmill, Nevin, Booth,
Jess, McAllister, Collins. Substitutes - Walker, McKinlay, Jackson, McGinlay,
McCoist.
SAN MARINO - Muccoli, Moroni, Gennari, Mazza, Valentini, Guerra, Manzaroli,
Matteoni, Bacciocchi, Mularoni, Francini. Substitutes - Gasperoni, Canti,
Peverani, Montagna, Della Valle.
Referee - Karel Bohunek (Czech Republic).

JUSTICE was served with the suicide in prison of Frederick West, and a jury
could acquit his wife Rosemary on 10 counts of murder with a clear conscience,
Winchester Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr West's final solution had removed a great burden from the shoulders of the
jury, Mr Richard Ferguson QC, defending, declared in his final address.
Mrs West's acquittal would not mean that a series of killings had gone
unpunished and unresolved.
The families of the victims need not worry that these crimes had gone
unpunished, he told the depleted jury of seven men and four women.
The Crown, he said, had presented a case that relied totally on speculation,
conjecture, and prejudice.
However, while Mrs West might have been involved in sexual assaults and,
perhaps, might have been party to rape, that did not make her a murderess.
There was no evidence, he insisted, that Mrs West was linked with the deaths of
the young women and girls whose remains were recovered from 25 Cromwell Street
last year.
It was, he said, unfortunate that the Crown had continued to prosecute this
case against Mrs West after her husband hanged himself in his cell at Winson
Green Prison, Birmingham, on New Year's Day.
It had done so without a shred of evidence against the defendant.
There had been no eyewitnesses, no confession, nor fingerprint and forensic
evidence. There had been no corroboration to the prosecution allegations.
Without these pieces of evidence, the Crown, Mr Ferguson said, faced an uphill
struggle from the outset.
He urged the jury to ignore siren voices which had reached conclusions from
what was seen on television and read in newspapers.
The jurors alone had heard all of the evidence and they had taken an oath to
reach verdicts based only on the evidence.
He told them that, in doing so: ``You must come to the inevitable conclusion.
You must acquit.''
Mrs West denies murdering 10 girls and women, including her daughter Heather
and step-daughter Charmaine.
Mr Ferguson told members of the jury he was sure they would not allow any
feelings of shock, disgust, or revulsion to alter, in any way, their returned
verdicts.
It might never be known how any of these unfortunate girls met their deaths but
not a shred of reliable evidence had been produced in court to prove the
defendant was party to their killings.
``You are not being asked to acquit in the teeth of the evidence,'' Mr Ferguson
continued. ``You are being asked to acquit because there is no evidence.''
The jury had heard tapes of Frederick West in interviews with the police,
during which he exonerated his wife from any involvement in the killings.
If he told the truth during these taped conversations, then, said Mr Ferguson,
the jury must acquit. Even if it believed what he said might be the truth, then
it had to return verdicts of not guilty.
West, he declared, was a man devoid of compassion, was consumed by sexual lust,
and was a sadistic killer.
To suggest he would give up his life to protect Rosemary West was an insult to
intelligence, Mr Ferguson insisted.
When first arrested, West had insisted in taped interviews that Mrs West had
nothing to do with the killings.
It was only weeks later, on April 28, that he started to implicate her and many
others. He was preparing a defence whereby he was innocent and everyone else
was guilty, said Mr Ferguson.
The Crown had relied heavily on the evidence of Mrs Janet Leach, the woman
appointed as an ``appropriate adult'' for the interviews.
This was to support the prosecution claim that Mr West was covering up for
person or persons unnamed.
``She was meant to be the high water mark in the prosecution case,'' said Mr
Ferguson.
``She told lies to the police. She told lies to you in court.''
He asked the jury to consider whether, if West had not taken his life and was
standing trial, the Crown would be asking it to challenge his taped confessions.
``Surely not,'' Mr Ferguson continued. Nevertheless, the taped evidence had the
ring of truth.
It was eminently possible he killed those girls alone, without the consent and
participation of his wife.
The Crown contended: ``How could she not have noticed that there were blood
spots on his clothes? How could she not have known what was going on?''
West was a working man. He did not have to parade himself for inspection every
morning.
Witnesses had given evidence that they had been raped, sexually assaulted, and
stalked by West when acting alone.
On these occasions, Mrs West was not required to entice them into his car.
Had these girls been murdered and their remains uncovered 20 years later at 25
Cromwell Street, would the Crown be asking the jury to conclude Mrs West must
have been involved to entice them into his vehicle, Mr Ferguson asked.
Bindings were found with the remains of Ms Anne McFall, Scottish nanny of West
and his first wife Rena. At that stage, Mrs West was 13.
Prior to their marriage, West was capable of killing without her assistance.
If that was true, he was equally capable of murder without her help after their
wedding.
He told the jury he was confident that no form of puritanical censure would
adversely affect its judgment.
Mr Brian Leveson QC, for the prosecution, had been like a mountain guide
leading the jury to the summit, where the top of the mountain would mean
conviction.
Unfortunately, as he led them up the mountain path he came to a gap - a void,
said Mr Ferguson. He invited the jury to jump that void with him.
``Don't jump,'' Mr Ferguson advised.
``For you, as with all of us, this has been a demanding and at times harrowing
experience. The responsibility resting on your shoulders is immense.''
The trial judge will begin summing up to the jury today. It is expected to be
invited to retire to consider verdicts on Monday.

Earnings slip at
Land Securities
BRITAIN'S biggest property group Land Securities experienced flat conditions in
the half-year to September with pre-tax profits emerging very slightly lower at
#118m on unchanged rental income of #198m. The interim dividend has been raised
3.6% to #7.1p.
LandSecs, which is also Scotland's largest private sector landlord, has now
embarked on phase two of the Almondvale Shopping Centre in Livingston as well
as refurbishing its office building in St Vincent Street, Glasgow.
Chief resigns
PETER Middleton has resigned as chief executive of Lloyd's of London to become
head of European operations of Salomon Brothers, the American securities house.
He will be succeeded by Ron Sandler, 43, who has been a key figure in the
Lloyd's reconstruction plan. Since May, Mr Sandler has been in charge of
implementing the plan. He joined the organisation last March as director,
special projects, having been chief executive of Exco, the moneybroker.
Enterprise boost
DUNBARTONSHIRE Enterprise has managed to promote #6.8m of new investment in the
area between Cumbernauld and Helensburgh over the last six months by putting in
just #50,000 of its own money. The new money poured into the local economy is
nearly three times more than its original target. It was shared by 11 companies
ranging from electronics firms to a packaging company and helped to create or
safeguard 312 jobs.

ENGLAND are still keeping Devon Malcolm - and South Africa - guessing over
their first Test line-up.
The Derbyshire fast bowler has been named in the 13-man squad for today's
series opener at Centurion Park.
General opinion is Malcolm will be left out, with the tourists picking three
steadier pacemen - Angus Fraser, Dominic Cork, and Darren Gough - plus spinner
Richard Illingworth.
But England are clearly concerned about how the pitch will play and have also
included left-arm swing bowler Mark Ilott in the squad.
``We will keep a completely open mind until the morning,'' said manager Ray
Illingworth, who did, however, confirm England would play six specialist
batsmen.
Illingworth repeatedly drew attention to the fact the pitch was still being
watered less than 24 hours before start of play.
``I would have thought it was unusually late to be watering it,'' said the
manager. ``I presume the groundsman is a bit worried about it not lasting the
distance.
``I thought when I first saw it that it would definitely take spin. But it's up
to us to get the right team to play on whatever is prepared.''
Illingworth confirmed England would either go in with three pace bowlers plus a
spinner, or choose four quick men.
Meanwhile, South Africa seem to have made up their minds - and look set to
field an all-pace attack.
Their chairman of selectors, Peter Pollock, declared himself ``delighted'' with
the pitch, predicting it would have pace and bounce.
That almost certainly means Pollock's 22-year-old son Shaun will make his Test
debut, with left-arm spinner Clive Eksteen omitted.
But the real pre-match puzzle concerns Malcolm. England's fastest bowler
still believes he holds a psychological advantage over South Africa after his
nine for 57 against them at The Oval 15 months ago.
Now, with the pitch perhaps more suited to pace than spin, he could still get
his chance to repeat that demolition job.
England (from): Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Thorpe, Hick, Smith, Russell,
Cork, Gough, Illingworth, Fraser, Malcolm, Ilott.
South Africa (from): Hudson, G Kirsten, Kronje, Cullinan, Rhodes, McMillan,
Richardson, Pollock, Matthews, Donald, Schultz, Eksteen.
NEW Zealand beat India by eight wickets in the first one-day international at
Jamshedpur yesterday.
Chasing India's total of 236 from 49.1 overs, New Zealand scored 237 for two
wickets in 47 overs. Scores:
India 236 (M Prabhakar 83, M Azharuddin 32, S Tendulkar 30); New Zealand 237
for two (M Crowe 107no, S Fleming 78no, M Greatbatch 31).

STERLING has been losing ground rapidly this month in response to mounting
speculation that an early cut in interest rates would be justified by the weak
state of the economy.
The dollar has been hit by the tussle for power in the US between the Democrat
President and Republican Congress over the federal budget, and this has rubbed
off on the pound.
But most of sterling's weakness reflects the increasing nervousness of the
foreign exchange markets that the Chancellor will go for broke, cutting taxes
in the Budget and subsequently pushing through a reduction in rates in
opposition to Bank of England advice.
Since the current upturn in inflationary pressures is in part a consequence of
the pound's fall from grace earlier in the year, Kenneth Clarke can hardly
afford to ignore the likely effect of his measures on sentiment in the foreign
exchange markets.
The latest cause for doubt about the so-called economic recovery was a poor set
of retail sales figures for last month. Widespread hopes of an increase in
sales volumes were not validated. Sales are no higher now than they were a year
ago.
There have been some signs of an upturn in consumer spending as the effects of
two years of fiscal stringency have begun to wear off, but retail sales remain
in the doldrums. Tax cuts, urged by the Retail Consortium, might help to
persuade people to dig a little deeper into their pockets, but they will not
show up in higher pay packets until April.
It is difficult to see how Mr Clarke could justify extensive reductions in tax
without frightening the City in general and the foreign exchange markets in
particular. His PSBR forecasts, already blown off course in the current year,
will be a crucial test for the markets.
Talk of a cut in rates without knowing the flavour of the Budget is premature.
One problem is that lower rates in the aftermath of a tax-cutting budget might
be damned by the markets.
Yet a cut in the New Year could coincide with a likely pick up in the economy.
At this stage it appears that Mr Clarke's room for manoeuvre on both fiscal and
monetary fronts is curtailed.
No recovery
GEORGE Wimpey's decision to follow Tarmac down the road of divesting parts of
the business in favour of focusing management effort and resources on just one
activity, could spark a bout of restructuring. Already BICC has tossed its
housing division into the ring.
The housing market has been in the doldrums for close to six years so it is not
surprising major players want to cut and run in the absence of any signs of
sustained recovery. Companies who have divested of their housing divisions will
be able to rebuild a business with more dependable earnings that is less
vulnerable to the abrupt swings of the housing market.
At the start of the year there were high hopes of a recovery in the housing
market coinciding with the upturn in the domestic economy. In the event,
economic growth has slowed down and with it has ebbed away any hope of a
recovery in either the new build or refurbishment housing market. There are
currently scant signs of revival with lower housing starts, falling prices and
fewer transactions.
At the end of September, total transactions were 9.1% lower than at the
equivalent time last year. The nadir for overall transactions was 1992, with
just 1.13 million. This year now looks as though it could produce a similarly
low figure.
Any hopes of special measures to boost the housing industry market in this
year's Budget are likely to be disappointed. The longer term prognosis for the
industry is good. Demographic trends towards an ageing population and increase
in the number of single households point to a need for greater housing volume.
Given the enlarged scale of its operations, Wimpey is better placed than many
of its rivals to capitalise on the eventual upturn in demand.
Lost appeal
THE long hot summer and what has so far been the mildest autumn for 25 years
were the last things Dawson International needed. The world seems awash with
cashmere jumpers and fairly drastic measures are being employed to clear
stocks, to try to establish a better market place for the 1996 winter season.
But there must be a question mark over cashmere's appeal as it is expensive in
the eyes of most customers. The price differential with top quality designer
woollen products such as those of John Smedley is probably not justified and
there is not the same fashion element - ``boring old cashmere'' was one comment
yesterday.
That apart, the new management team at Dawson does seem to know what it is
doing. It is reducing costs, improving work practices and continuing to clear
up past mistakes such as over-stocking in the US thermal business. It will cost
a significant amount, perhaps #6m, but it will give Dawson a better operation
in that territory for 1996.
Unfortunately, the downturn in demand and profits warning have postponed for
perhaps a couple of years any prospect of Dawson taking part in the necessary
restructuring of the UK textile industry. It has the balance sheet strength to
be a medium-sized player, but management simply is not available for anything
other than day-to-day operations.
Turning this on its head, no-one is likely to want to take over Dawson until
the Pringle problems are resolved, and these alone will take at least a year.
Altogether, it is not a happy picture. Investors and employees are still
bearing the pain caused by the indecision of the non-executive directors who
took far too long to change the previous top management. But all they can do is
grin and bear it until volume recovers.

EFFORTS will be made next year to promote tourism on the back, so to speak, of
one of its best and most elusive assets, the Loch Ness Monster.
Loch Ness, a film featuring Cheers star Ted Danson as a US scientist in search
of Nessie, is due for release in February.
Unfortunately, he first experiences a hideous parody of tartan kitsch, not
unlike the image portrayed by writer Jill Crawshaw in her recent Herald series:
appalling ceilidhs, tacky flashing lights, and a hotel keeper who rips him off.
Scottish Tourist Board officials who have been given a preview are taking it on
the chin. As the film progresses, Danson meets real people, and the abiding
impression is of positive endorsement of beautiful scenery, clean environment,
and friendly welcome.
They believe it will have even more international impact than Braveheart and
Rob Roy, which helped in the domestic tourism increase of 16% in the first six
months of this year.
Mr Graham Birse, STB director of public relations, said: ``It is a family film
in the traditional sense and has a charm all of its own. It will be a
significant boost for us in all markets, particularly the United States.''
q Danson is also shown as a man of taste and discernment: he is shown reading
The Herald over breakfast.

ERNIE Els, the former US Open champion and double World Matchplay champion,
rarely deals in just four figures these days, but on his last outing, a skins
game in Taipei, he won a mere $6000, hardly even small change for the engaging
South African.
His globetrotting has now led him to Miyazaki in southern Japan, where he has a
yen to resume normal service in the Dunlop Phoenix tournament, which starts
today, and win one of those familiar cheques with lots of noughts on the end -
36,000,000 is the number of yen the winner will receive, about #1.3m.
Els, who won the title in 1993, looked a little flabby, despite a schedule that
has taken him from Wentworth to St Andrews to Tulsa to Atlanta to the Far East
in consecutive weeks.
Colin Montgomerie was to play here for the first time but his overworked left
wrist gave out at the Visa Taiheiyo Masters last week, and after opening the
odd supermarket in Tokyo, he flew home to give it a rest. Jose Maria Olazabal
and Ian Woosnam also are absent injured, but Philip Walton and Costantino
Rocca, two of the season's heroes, are here, along with Englishman Barry Lane
and Miguel Angel Jimenez, of Spain.
There are also a host of big-name Americans, all former major champions: Tom
Watson, Larry Nelson, Larry Mize, Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson, and Jeff Sluman.
Watson came tantalisingly close to beating Jumbo Ozaki last year - the Japanese
won the title by a shot - and it was, of course, on the greens that the
American failed.

MINERS' president Arthur Scargill was reproached yesterday by leaders of
several of the main TUC unions for seeking to absorb the breakaway OILC North
Sea union into the National Union of Mineworkers.
He was summoned to Congress House where he was confronted by general secretary
John Monks and six North Sea unions.
These were the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union; the General,
Municipal, and Boilermakers; the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance; the Rail,
Maritime, and Transport; the ships' officers' union, Numast, and the Transport
and General Workers'.
They left him in no doubt that they considered the North Sea as being their
sphere of influence.
After the two-hour meeting, Mr Monks wrote to Mr Scargill summarising how the
North Sea unions had reiterated their position that they regarded the OILC as a
breakaway organisation and therefore were totally opposed to any transfer of
engagements by the OILC to the NUM.
Unless the NUM agrees to abandon its proposed move into the North Sea sector it
could find itself the subject of a TUC disputes committee investigation and
ultimately, if it refused to abide by that committee's ruling, it could be
expelled from the TUC.
Mr Ronnie McDonald, OILC general secretary, who was not at yesterday's meeting,
told The Herald his organisation was still keen to link up with the NUM and/or
the Norwegian offshore oil industry union, OFS, possibly under the aegis of the
Paris-based International Energy and Mineworkers Organisation (president one
Arthur Scargill).
The OILC, which claims to have around 1800 members, was set up in the wake of
the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster.
The current row surfaced in June, when Mr Scargill announced that his union was
disposed to accept an OILC offer to transfer engagements to the NUM.

12 months.
n  The #4600m park opened on a 170-acre site near Paris in April 1992.
n More than 2000 British workers helped construct the site, with some earning
as much as #30 an hour.
n Despite welcoming two million UK visitors in the opening summer season, the
park lost more than #600m in its first year.
n First-year attendances were more than 10 million and about 9.5 million in the
second year - some one million fewer than Disney had predicted.
n People spent far less than the hoped #46 a head.
n The park has more than 40 attractions including Space Mountain, opened in
June.
n It has 5200 hotel beds and 600 self-catering rooms.
n In the winter of 1993, Euro Disney and its 60 banks began rescue talks that
culminated in a #725m rights issue in June 1994.
n Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal agreed to pump about #300m into the project
as part of this restructuring.
n 1994 also saw the park change its name to Disneyland Paris.
n The new-look attraction cut entry prices by 20% and trimmed its workforce by
5000 to 12,000.

ABERDEEN-based oil company Pentex has agreed to a #31.2m takeover by Melrose
Energy, which has oil and gas assets in the United States.
The Melrose offer values Pentex at 156p per share, 30% more than its Tuesday
closing price of 120p, and provides for senior Pentex executives to take charge
of running the enlarged group.
London-based Melrose is offering 81 new Melrose shares for 20 Pentex shares in
a deal which will give Pentex shareholders a 29.5% stake in Melrose.
It has sweetened the offer by promising a 50% increase in the full-year
dividend for the current financial year to at least 0.72p.
Pentex chairman Henry Cameron will become chief executive of Melrose and Pentex
managing director George Lane will become managing director of the enlarged
group.
Robert Adair, a geologist and chartered accountant who currently owns 60% of
Melrose, will step down as chief executive to become finance director and
deputy chairman instead. His stake will fall to 40% after the merger
Melrose, which merged with Crossroads Oil in March, is developing oil and gas
fields in Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming in partnership with other investors. It
made a pre-tax profit of #5.3m in the year to June 30.
However, it has only half a dozen employees and works exclusively through
sub-contractors.
Pentex on the other hand is a small hands-on oil company with 67 employees
which produces more than 6000 barrels of oil per day from two fields in the
North Sea.
It also produces about 500 barrels per day of oil equivalent of gas onshore in
the English Midlands. Some of this is used to generate electricity on behalf of
Yorkshire Electricity.
Pentex made a pre-tax profit of #3.3m in the year to December 31 1994.
The Aberdeen-based company was floated on the stock exchange in January with
the aim of eventually issuing new shares to fund an acquisition. But it has
unexpectedly dropped the role of hunter to become prey instead.
Mr Cameron, a 55-year-old Aberdeen lawyer who has headed Pentex since 1988,
said his firm received several takeover proposals.
But Melrose, with which Pentex has been talking since August, offered the best
price and the best guarantees of continued activity, he said.
Pentex shares closed up 20p at 140p.
Melrose, which is launching a one-for-five #13.2m rights issue to raise working
capital for the enlarged group, closed down !sp at 38p.
Mr Adair said the merger would give Melrose ``a more broadly based income
stream'' and ``a highly experienced and innovative oil and gas management
team.''
But he gave notice that Melrose remained on the acquisition trail with up to
#30m of cash available to spend on a new purchase within the next six to 12
months.
The Melrose offer will be put to an extraordinary meeting of Pentex
shareholders on December 11.

AN Edinburgh petrol station became a target of the international protest
against Shell when campaigners picketed customers and urged them to boycott the
brand.
Around 20 campaigners, including Edinburgh University students and Greenpeace
and Friends of the Earth supporters, took part in the demonstration in the
forecourt of the Causewayside filling station, which has been selling Shell
petrol for only a few months.
They handed motorists leaflets highlighting the executions of Mr Saro-Wiwa and
other activists and calling on Shell to withdraw from Nigeria. They urged
customers to write or phone Shell ``to let them know you are outraged''.
Mr Ian Standing, managing director of Kennet, the company which owns the petrol
station, responded by giving the protesters leaflets, distributed by Shell,
which describe claims that Shell has been responsible for ``environmental
devastation'' in Nigeria as ``false and misleading''.

MANCHESTER United must defend a second charge of poaching schoolboys after the
Football Association yesterday acted on complaints from Oldham over Old
Trafford's recruitment of 16-year-old David Brown.
They have charged United in respect of an alleged illegal approach to the
teenager while he was registered as an associate schoolboy with their
neighbours.
Alex Ferguson's side, whose youth culture makes them the envy of the
Premiership, already face a similar charge after Arsenal claimed they enticed
away Matthew Wicks.
The son of former Chelsea defender Steve Wicks is already an England Under-18
player.
If United are found guilty they will face a hefty fine, probably in five
figures although nowhere near the #750,000 suggested in some quarters. They
could also be ordered to pay Oldham and Arsenal compensation.
Yesterday's charge follows several months of inquiries. United have been asked
to make a written response within 14 days and can request a personal hearing.
The FA believe United may have broken both Premier and Football League rules.

BANK of England Governor Eddie George advised the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, to adopt a wait-and-see attitude to interest rates at a meeting
between the two men at the end of September, the first time he had not
recommended an increase since April.
Minutes of the September 29 meeting, published yesterday, showed Mr George
repeated his view that the Government was likely to miss its inflation target.
``The Bank's advice was to wait until the position became clearer before making
any policy move,'' the minutes said.
Mr George noted encouraging signs that factory input and output prices were
rising more slowly but did not think the evidence was ``wholly reliable''.
He was also uncertain about the slowdown in activity, predicting that it would
pick up modestly in the months ahead.
Mr Clarke said slower manufacturing output and retail sales growth ``had
increased the probability'' that the inflation target - which aims to deliver
an underlying rate of 2.5% or less in two years - would be met and was not
``unduly concerned'' about the pick-up in August's rise in the retail prices
index.
It could be explained by the effect of the exceptionally hot weather on
seasonal food prices.
Mr Clarke said the main cause for concern about the inflation outlook was the
strength of M4, the broad measure of the money supply, but added that it had
behaved in an unpredictable manner in recent years.
``He agreed with the Governor's recommendation that interest rates should
remain unchanged this month,'' said the minutes.

COMMERCIAL Union yesterday echoed General Accident's contention on Tuesday that
motor insurance premiums, which usually lead general insurance rates, are
likely to rise, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Currently they are at a low ebb after two years of weakness and finance
director Peter Foster commented: ``I think the next move is probably going to
be in an upward direction, but whether that occurs in the fourth quarter or the
beginning of next year remains to be seen.''
Third quarter profits of CU dipped only marginally from #131m to #137m, a
performance which put 16p on the shares at 614p. The nine months' total came to
#381m against #327m.
In the UK, profits were 14% lower at #74m which compares favourably with the
other insurers who have reported. In common with others, subsidence claims were
up to a total #16m. The London market operations cut losses from #39m to #15m,
reflecting improved claims experience and premium rises.
CU says that its Groupe Victoire acquisition in France continues to bed down
well. The first stage of integration is essentially complete though no major
cost savings have yet been achieved - mass sackings are just not done in the
country. France is now the largest territory, accounting for almost a third of
total premiums, against the UK's 26%.
The purchase swelled life profits to #164m from #95m, though the UK was down
11% at #32m as new annual premiums sank 26%.
CU's Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, is looking up, with profits ahead #30m at
#83m as reorganisation in recent years paid off. US profits were slightly ahead
at #38m. New disclosure rules mean that insurers will have to itemise
provisions for asbestosis and environmental pollution exposures.
CU's year-end provisions are expected to be $130m for the former and $500m for
the latter, though net annual claims have averaged $16m and $30m respectively
over the past three years.

A COUPLE who claimed the privacy of their dream home was wrecked when someone
built a house next door won #14,700 damages yesterday from the previous owner.
A sheriff ruled that Mrs Lesley Jenkins, 35, was in breach of contract because
she failed to tell Mr James Mackie, 59, and his wife Jean, 54, that planning
permission had been sought for developing land 80 yards from the back door of
the secluded Hayhill in Bardowie, north of Glasgow.
The couple bought the house - a unique, architect-designed country bungalow -
for #285,000 in preparation for their retirement.
They claimed the privacy was ruined because their new neighbours could see
every move that they made - both inside and outside the house.
Dumbarton Sheriff Frederick Levine judged that Mrs Jenkins knew about planning
permission for the other building - but had failed to tell the Mackies before
the sale was concluded.
Mr and Mrs Mackie were hoping for almost #30,000 in damages, claiming this was
the amount by which the property was devalued by the loss of privacy.
However, in his written judgment, the sheriff set the figure at half this
amount - and criticised Mrs Jenkins' part in the transaction.
Sheriff Levine said Mrs Jenkins had been properly notified more than once about
planning permission being sought for the building of a house in the field next
door.
He added: ``She knew . . . (this was) likely to affect the privacy and value of
Hayhill.''
He then quoted a clause from the ``offer'' letter sent from the Mackies'
solicitor to Mrs Jenkins. It read: ``The seller is not aware of any proposals
by neighbouring proprietors or others which might affect the privacy of the
subjects.''
The judgment continued: ``Mrs Jenkins accepted these conditions of the contract
without comment. She did not disclose the information she was required to under
its terms.''
The sheriff concluded: ``The Mackies have lost amenity of privacy both inside
and outside Hayhill.''
The sheriff set the total damages at #14,700 - consisting of #13,000 for a loss
of property value, and #1700 for inconvenience while the other house was being
built and for a kitchen door which was damaged before the Mackies moved in.
Mrs Mackie, 54, said later: ``Oh is that all we're getting. I can't say any
more. You'll have to ask my husband.''
Mr Mackie, 59, was at work and unavailable for comment - as was mum-of-two Mrs
Jenkins, 35, who now lives at Craigmillar Avenue, in Milngavie.
The court was told that the Mackies, who lived in Lenzie, had searched for two
years for their ideal home - somewhere secluded, yet close to city amenities.
When Hayhill came on the market, they wanted it so much that they offered
#35,000 above the asking price to secure the purchase.
Two days after they moved in, local farmer Jack Brewster came to introduce
himself - and told them work was about to start on his new house next door.
Mr Mackie, an electrical engineer, told the court: ``We certainly would not
have bought Hayhill if we had known what was going to happen.''
The court heard that Mrs Mackie also claimed she had suffered stress from
construction noise - and was subjected to verbal abuse from workmen.

PAUL Gascoigne has been named in the referee supervisor's report on last
Saturday's match between Rangers and Aberdeen at Ibrox, but three other players
- Gascoigne's team-mates John Brown and Alan McLaren, and Aberdeen's Billy
Dodds - also are in trouble.
The report arrived at the SFA yesterday and shortly afterwards both clubs and
all four players were asked to explain their conduct during the match. It is
likely their behaviour and comments will be considered during a disciplinary
committee meeting on Monday.
Gascoigne's behaviour by now has been well documented, but the conduct of the
others didn't receive the same degree of exposure.
They, in fact, became involved in a bad-tempered tussle in the second half,
when McLaren and Dodds disputed possession and then the Aberdeen player
appeared to aim a kick at his opponent.
Brown then arrived and it looked as though he made contact with a hand or an
arm on Dodds' head. McLaren's reaction was ill-tempered, but there was no
physical abuse on his part.
A spokesman at Park Gardens said yesterday: ``We have received the supervisor's
report and, on the strength of what is contained in it, we will be seeking the
comments of those involved.
``The report made mention of Paul Gascoigne and also three other players, John
Brown and Alan McLaren of Rangers, and Aberdeen's Billy Dodds. We hope to have
the comments of clubs and players by Friday.''
Gascoigne is likely to be summoned to appear before the SFA after Monday's
disciplinary meeting and, depending on the mood of the meeting, the others
involved might also have to take the long walk up the hill.
Alan Lawrence, of Hearts, has been asked to explain an alleged use of an elbow
against Rangers' Craig Moore in a game last month and Airdrie's Sean Sweeney,
who is alleged to have kicked Dundee's Morten Wieghorst in a Coca-Cola Cup
semi-final, also will have to offer an explanation.
However, in light of the news which stunned Dumbarton's keeper Ian McFarlane
yesterday, the players should not believe they will be treated lightly if found
guilty.
McFarlane was told he had been sent off twice in last Saturday's match against
Airdrie and has been banned for three games, although that might not be the end
of the matter.
The keeper was dismissed after a disagreement with Airdrie's Jim McIntyre, who
later described the incident as handbags at 10 paces.''
However, the head of the SFA's disciplinary department, Drew Herbertson, said
McFarlane had been sent off twice, once for alleged head-butting and again for
an alleged punch.
Each offence carries an automatic one-match ban and 12 penalty points, which
means the keeper is well beyond the 16-point threshold and picks up another
game ban.
``Both McFarlane and Dumbarton are being asked for their comments,'' said
Herbertson.
Dumbarton have sent out an emergency call to the old warhorse, John Burridge,
who coaches Newcastle's keepers during the week.
Burridge helped Dumbarton out last year when they were left short of keepers
through injury.
q BIRMINGHAM City were at the centre of an alleged dressing room brawl after
their Anglo-Italian Cup match in Ancona yesterday. The coach of the second
division Ancona team was said to have been injured in the fighting between
players and officials.
Massimo Cacciatori allegedly was butted by a Birmingham player and suffered a
cut over his left eyebrow and a bruise. The game, which Birmingham won 2-1, was
marred by rough play and fights between players at Conero stadium.

JACK Charlton and the Republic of Ireland owed an enormous debt of gratitude to
their northern neighbours after a thrilling night in Group 6 of the European
Championship qualifying competition.
Northern Ireland destroyed Austria's hopes of a place in the finals with a
marvellous 5-3 victory at Windsor Park.
And that result took the Republic into a play-off with Holland at Anfield on
December 13 for the final place, despite a convincing 3-0 defeat at the hands
of group winners Portugal.
Northern Ireland manager Brian Hamilton sent a message of goodwill to Jack
Charlton after the game in Belfast. He said: ``We wish the Republic well. They
deserve to go through on the basis of their results in the group.
``I hope Jack is successful. He is a good man and he has done a great job.''
Charlton, who has dismissed speculation that he might be about to leave the
manager's job after nine years, said that despite the drubbing they received at
the hands of an inspired Portuguese side in Lisbon, the Irish still had a
fighting chance of making the finals.
``I have to thank Bryan Hamilton,'' he said. ``I'll be buying him a bottle of
whisky - duty free because it's cheaper,'' he joked.
Michael O'Neill of Hibs was the architect of Northern Ireland's rousing victory
with two goals.
He got the opener when Michael Hughes crossed the ball over and Iain Dowie
chested it down. O'Neill was on hand to fire a sweet left-foot shot home from
the edge of the box. The Irish added a second in the 32nd minute when
Pfeifenberger brought down Dowie in the box. The West Ham striker fired an
unstoppable spot kick past stranded keeper Konsel.
Hunter, making his home debut, scored his first goal at this level after 53
minutes when Konsel punched away a Gillespie cross and the Wrexham centre-half
finished like a decent centre forward.
The Austrians, to their credit, dug deep and got a goal back in 56 minutes when
Markus Schopp headed in.
The Irish regained their three-goal advantage when Phillip Gray got the final
touch after Hunter had beaten Konsel when he followed up a corner from Hughes
in 64 minutes.
Irish keeper Alan Fettis could only parry a shot from Polster in 70 minutes and
substitute Christian Stumpf followed it up.
The fun continued in 78 minutes when O'Neill got his second goal after Hughes
had raced almost the full length of the pitch to put him clear.
Austria got their third goal nine minutes from time when Manchester City's
midfielder Steve Lomas slipped and subsitute Arnold Wetl drilled the ball past
Fettis.
Hamilton said: ``We have made massive changes and my players deserve enormous
credit.
``We showed great resilience tonight and the way we kept possession was very
pleasing.
``There is a wind of change blowing through Northern Ireland football and I
believe we are heading for brighter days.''
Although the Republic fought gallantly in Lisbon to stay on terms in the first
half they were eventually steam-rollered by a Portugese team two or three
classes above them in technical ability.
Only the heroics of Sheffield United goalkeeper Alan Kelly and the brilliant
tackling of veteran centre back Paul McGrath, playing his record-breaking 79th
game for the Republic, prevented Portugal launching an avalanche of goals in
the second period.
Kelly kept out successive shots from Paulo Sousa, Louis Figo and Carlos
Secretairo before finally being beaten when Fiorientina midfielder Rui Costa
lobbed him from fully 30 yards and saw the ball bounce in from the underside of
the crossbar.
Portugal, who had raised the tempo in the second half following a tip-tap
display of pretty passing in the first, proceeded to drive home the victory
and, after the initial breakthrough, it was just a matter of how many they
would score.
Defender Cristovao Helder added a second with a header from Figo's corner on 74
minutes and just before the end substitute Jorge Cadete slotted home the third.

A SHORTFALL in expected production from Texas fields has led Edinburgh-based
Pittencrieff Resources to predict a loss for this year.
Chief executive Terry Heneaghan said yesterday that a fresh evaluation of all
the company's gas and oil assets in the US and Canada showed a sharp drop in
proven reserves to 17 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from 36.1 billion
at the end of last year.
The value of these reserves has been slashed to $83.7m from $156.8m at the end
of 1994.
Mr Heneaghan said exploratory drilling at Pittencrieff's fields in Corpus
Christi, Texas - for which the company paid $38m in 1994 - had revealed fewer
reserves than expected. He added that technical difficulties were making the
exploration process difficult.
``We drilled into the zones and found that we're not getting the results that
the engineers said we would,'' he said. ``Not until you actually poke the hole
down there will you know what is actually going to come out.''
With less oil and gas reserves than previously thought, Pittencrieff has been
forced to reduce its total asset figures. Recent increases in gas prices are
insufficient to offset the asset depletion charges.
Mr Heneaghan said it was difficult to tell at this stage exactly how large the
company's 1995 loss would be.
Pittencrieff has commissioned a $750,000 3-D seismic study of the Corpus
Christi fields to determine exactly what resources are there and how they can
best be recovered. Until that is completed in around six months, it will not be
drilling any new wells at the site.
Edinburgh-based Bell Lawrie White analyst Colin Telfer said the study's
conclusions would determine Pittencrieff's future. ``We have to wait until that
is finished,'' he said, ``but it still doesn't affect their cash flow.''
Mr Heneaghan said Dallas-based Netherland, Sewall &amp; Associates, which is
conducting the engineering evaluation of Pittencrieff's US assets, was widely
known as a highly professional yet conservative company. For that reason, the
preliminary appraisal could reflect a lower amount of reserves than were
actually there.
The preliminary report showed a slight increase in probable reserves, up from
4650 million to 4800 million boe. After deducting net debt, there is
approximately 80p of asset backing per company share.
Mr Heneaghan said the group's other assets, which include the Fort Chadbourne
site in Texas and the Patricia/Dinosaur gas field in Canada, were continuing to
perform well.
Pittencrieff shares were unchanged at 43p.

STERLING'S trade-weighted index, the barometer of the pound's international
value most closely monitored by the Bank of England, fell to its lowest ever
level last night after figures showed an expected decline in the volume of
retail sales last month and the first rise in seasonally-adjusted unemployment
for more than two years.
The gloomy news on the economy intensified expectations in the City that
interest rates would be cut sooner rather than later. The pound, already under
pressure from a weak dollar, fell sharply against the German mark, where it
lost 1.80 pfennigs to DM2.1849, within a pfennig of its all-time low of
DM2.1755.
The trade-weighted index dropped 0.7 points to 82.6, 0.1 points below the
previous low on May 9, shortly after the Governor of the Bank of England and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer fell out over rates.
But shares and gilts took heart from the speculation that rates would have to
be cut. The FTSE-100 share index gained 23.5 points to 3571.4.
The Retail Consortium, which claims to represent more than 90% of shops, called
on the Chancellor to cut taxes in the Budget on November 28.
James May, the consortium's director general, said: ``The Budget provides an
opportunity for the Chancellor to relieve some of the negative factors which
are holding back consumer spending at present.
``Retailers are looking for a sustainable tax-cutting Budget. As long as public
expenditure is firmly controlled this can be delivered without breaching
responsible limits on public borrowing.''
Later today the PSBR figures for October will show the extent to which the
Government's borrowing requirement has exceeded Treasury forecasts in the first
seven months of the current fiscal year.
Retail sales fell by 0.1% in October, disappointing City forecasts of an
increase of around 0.4% and contradicting an optimistic distributive trades
survey from the CBI last week. The only consolation was that the figures for
September were revised up from a 0.1% rise to 0.3%. There were also small
upward revisions to the figures for July and August. The volume of sales was
precisely the same as it was in October last year.
The three-month on three-month comparisons were even more disappointing. These
showed that sales fell by 0.3% in the latest three months and were just 0.1%
higher than in the same three months a year ago.
In October clothing and footwear sales fell by 1.4% and food by 0.4%. The mild
weather was blamed for the former and higher prices may be hitting food
volumes. Elsewhere increases were modest, except for household goods which
jumped 1.3%.
The three-monthly comparisons showed that this sector increased sales by 1.9%
despite the weakness of the housing market. The ready availability of cheap
credit could explain this apparent aberration from the broader picture.
The biggest declines in the latest three months were recorded by clothing and
footwear (down 2.1%) and non-store retailing (down 2%).
The retail sales deflator edged down from 3.5% in September to 3.4%, suggesting
that October's inflation figures, which will be published later today, may be a
little better than expected.
The unexpected increase of 200 in seasonally adjusted unemployment to 2,265,500
was the first rise since August 1993. The change is minimal and unemployment
was lower in six out of 10 areas, including Scotland. The July numbers -
originally reported as showing an increase - are now sporting a drop of 200.
The Central Statistical Office said that the October figures might be distorted
by an unusually large number of young people joining the register, but other
labour market indicators confirmed the picture of weakness.
Vacancies fell by 1800 in October, the largest decline since June 1989, while
manufacturing employment fell by another 3000 in September, the third
consecutive drop.
Growth in average earnings was unchanged in September at 3.25%, but
year-on-year growth in unit labour costs picked up from 3.6% to 3.8% as the
sharp slowdown in productivity continued.
Adam Cole of James Capel said: ``The rise in unemployment, coupled with stable
average earnings growth and the fall in retail sales, significantly increases
the chance of a rate cut sooner rather than later.
``The last piece of the jigsaw is likely to be the Budget, where a positive
market response could mean rates are cut around the turn of the year.''

ON A night when 14 teams booked their places alongside hosts England in the
1996 European Championship finals, with two others involved in a play-off next
month, Norway were eliminated after having led their qualifying group for
almost a year.
The Norwegians, who last year qualified for the World Cup finals for the first
time in 56 years, needed to avoid defeat in Rotterdam to qualify for the
European finals for the first time in their history.
But their dreams were shattered as they lost 3-0 to finish third in Group 5
behind the Czech Republic and Holland.
A goal four minutes into the second half from Clarence Seedorf and two in the
last two minutes from Youri Mulder and Marc Overmars finished off the
Norwegians - who had let in only four goals in their previous nine qualifiers.
But the Dutch, European champions in 1988, must meet Ireland in a play-off in
Liverpool on December 13 for the final qualifying berth.
Germany, the only country to win the European title twice, avenged their recent
defeats against Bulgaria with a 3-1 win in Berlin to take first place from the
Bulgarians in Group 7. Jurgen Klinsmann, who scored twice, took his tally for
the competition to nine.
But it was a night of mixed emotions for Klinsmann, who received a first-half
booking which rules him out of Germany's first match in the finals in England,
where he played with such success at Tottenham Hotspur last season.
Gianfranco Zola went one better than Klinsmann, scoring a second-half hat trick
as Italy overwhelmed Lithuania 4-0 to clinch their berth.
The diminutive playmaker, brought on as a second-half substitute, struck three
times in just 18 minutes after Lithuanian captain Ramunas Stonkus's own goal
had given Italy the lead in 51 minutes.
Nikola Jurcevic's diving header gave Croatia a 2-1 victory over Slovenia.
Croatia topped Group 4 thanks to a better head-to-head record against Italy.
There was joy at last for Azerbaijan - who picked up their first point after
nine defeats by drawing 0-0 with Poland in neutral Trabzon in Turkey.
That left Estonia and San Marino as the only two teams out of the 47 taking
part to have lost all their qualifying games.
France erased painful memories when they beat Israel 2-0 with two late goals.
The French, anxious to wipe out memories of the embarrassing 3-2 home defeat by
Israel in 1993 which cost them a place in the World Cup finals, wasted several
opportunities before taking the lead in 69 minutes.

SCOTLAND'S bowlers staged a brief revival in the European indoor team
championship in Jersey yesterday when they moved to within nine points of
leaders Wales after the men's session of singles and fours matches but, with
Wales drawing a blank last night, Scotland's women tumbled to two defeats
against Guernsey to miss out on a great chance of closing the gap.
The revival started yesterday afternoon when East Lothian's Graham Robertson
had a straight-sets win over Guernsey's Jon Queripel to pick up the maximum
three points. Robertson took the opener 7-4, the second 7-3, and then drew the
match-winning shot with his last bowl of the seventh end for a 7-6 third-set
margin.
Queripel had been pushed into the singles event earlier in the day when Adrian
Welch pulled out for the second day owing to illness.
``Given the circumstances, Jon played well,'' said Robertson. ``Although it was
a straight-sets win, it was a lot closer than that - the first set and the last
could have gone either way.''
Scotland then added the points in the men's fours when Willie Galloway, David
Gourlay, Hugh Duff, and Angus Blair recovered after dropping a second-end 7 to
beat Paul Ingrouille's Guernsey rink 27-16.
However, there was disappointment last night when the women's side failed to
build on these two results.
Joyce Lindores started well against Anne Simon, leading 4-0 and later 6-5, but
she lost the opening set 7-6 and thereafter she struggled. Simon needed just
three ends to take the second set on a 7-0 whitewash and she coasted through
the third 7-2.
Nor was there any cheer for Scotland in the women's fours. Kate Adams, Jan
Woodley, Sarah Gourlay, and Jeanette Conlan lost two shots on the last end to
go down 14-12 to Carol Ingrouille's Guernsey side.
With Wales having lost all four of their matches to England, they stayed on the
33-points mark, where England joined them, although the Welsh have a shots
differential of 107 against England's 93. Ireland now are in third spot on 25
points, one ahead of the Scots. Results:
Men. Singles - A Thomson (England) beat S Rees (Wales) 1-7, 7-3, 7-5, 7-1; J
Henry (Ireland) bear D Le Marquand (Jersey) 7-1, 4-7, 7-3, 6-7, 7-6; G
Robertson (Scotland) beat J Queripel (Guernsey) 7-4, 7-3, 7-6. Fours - Scotland
27, Guernsey 16; England 18, Wales 14; Ireland 22, Jersey 21.
Women. Singles - J Roylance (England) beat R Jones (Wales) 2-7, 7-3, 7-0, 7-3;
M Johnston (Ireland) beat V Stead (Jersey) 7-0, 4-7, 7-3, 7-5; A Simon
(Guernsey) beat J Lindores (Scotland) 7-6, 7-0, 7-2. Pairs - Ireland 20, Wales
15; England 28, Scotland 14; Guernsey 16, Jersey 12. Triples - Ireland 13,
Guernsey 11; Jersey 17, England 13; Wales 11, Scotland 11. Fours - Guernsey 14,
Scotland 12; Jersey 18, Ireland 11; England 21, Wales 16.

ENGLAND achieved their first victory in a year last night as national coach
Terry Venables confounded his critics and Paul Gascoigne offered no new
ammunition to his.
Gascoigne was involved in the build up to two of the goals and used his arms
only to embrace the scorers of them and wave to a satisfied crowd. Venables was
able to claim vindication of a selection that had left out David Platt, Peter
Beardsley and Les Ferdinand, while finally offering Alan Shearer some support
in the shape of Teddy Sheringham, who headed the second goal.
A goal to each side just before half-time set light to a game that had been
glowing nicely until then. The Swiss went ahead in the 41st minute with two
deft moments of skill under pressure. Turkyilmaz, out on the left, curled in a
cross which his striking partner Adrian Knup met with the finest of headers.
The equaliser, four minutes later, also finished with a significant Swiss
touch, defender Quentin diverting in Stuart Pearce's shot after Gascoigne had
played a short corner to McManaman.
The Rangers man had first quickened English pulses in the fifth minute, given
an opportunity by Jamie Redknapp to turn, some 25 yards out, and move forward
before curling a right-footed shot beyond the far post.
A change in the midfield was immediately necessary, Redknapp having pulled a
hamstring and having to make way for Nottingham Forest's Steve Stone, a more
natural wide player.
It was a poor pass by Gascoigne that put his team in trouble for the first
time, forcing Pallister into a hurried clearance straight to Knup. The
Karlsruhe striker's shot,though fierce, was straight enough for Seaman to parry.
A similar incident gave England their most encouraging moment of the first
half-hour. Alain Geiger, playing for the 110th time at international level,
belied his experience by hitting the ball at Sheringham, who stabbed it square
for Shearer. Goalkeeper Pascolo beat out the 20-yard drive to prevent Shearer
registering his first goal in eight games for his country.
As in Norway on his debut last month, Stone got in some useful crosses, one of
which brought England's second goal after 56 minutes. Gascoigne began the move,
carried on by Lee, Neville and Stone and finished with a flourish by
Sheringham's firm header.
Their confidence soaring, England went on to establish control and claim a
third goal 12 minutes from the end. Stone, looking offside, reacted quickly to
score after the goalkeeper had pushed out Shearer's shot.

BICC has warned that it will be making rationalisation and closure provisions
of around #80m in 1995, mostly reflecting major rationalisations throughout its
cables business as it reduces costs and capacity in that sector.
The group is also in discussion with interested parties on the sale of its
housebuilding business. In the present depressed housing environment this is
likely to result in a loss against the book value of the assets. If the
business is sold, then for accounting purposes, goodwill written off on an
acquisition made in 1987, amounting to #44m, would also be shown as a charge
against profits.

NOT really ill - just jolly uncomfortable. Don't put your sinuses up for
scraping or your septum for a new direction in life unless you wish to feel
that your face has run into Frank Bruno . . . or maybe even Gazza on a
high-pressure day.
Everyone has been most kind. The nurse who admitted me says I will be looked
after by the red team - is this on instructions from St Andrew's House, I
wonder? - the anaesthetist tells me he was at Cardiff last Saturday and that
Fiji should have won. I am about to answer his question about Scotland's
chances this week when all the lights in my stadium go out.
Wake up with a nose packed like Ibrox on Old Firm day wearing a kind of bag
that you used to see on carthorses. Would you like a painkiller, inquires an
angel? No, a large gin and tonic is not what we had in mind.
The television is on in my room, a programme about the Daily Record of all
things. Am I hallucinating or did Joan Burnie really tell a story about a woman
with false teeth who was worried about oral sex? Must have been the drugs.
A long night of snuffling and wiping is enlivened when a friendly nurse gives
me a ham and cucumber sandwich and I give it back, re-cycled, in a matter of
moments. Settled for Sarah Miles, her autobiography.
It's maybe 20 years since I have been kept overnight in a hospital and I have
strict instructions to rest, take a break, watch the television. There are a
lot of splendid programmes on during the day, I am assured. Well I had nine
channels at my disposal and they were uniformly awful.
I started with Kilroy on BBC; he used to be a kind of upmarket Labour MP -
actually he would fit in very well with the new Blair image - but now makes a
lot more lolly from the box. His was the first of many shows where presenters
leapt into the audience.
Sadly the audience did not throw them back.
Kilroy tells us more and more people in Britain are taking the law into their
own hands. There were no stats to back up this assertion but his studio was
full of folk only too ready to zap intruders, fight for the last supermarket
trolley, defend to the death their parking space. Pass the remote control,
Alice.
I flitted for a while on Sky Movies with Mario And The Mob but it was a bit too
like Kilroy and the Cast so I went to Channel 4. Their schools' broadcast was
entitled Maths Everywhere. Only wish it were.
Went back to the Beeb for Good Morning with Anne and Nick. After 10 minutes
decided this pair reminded me of Andy Pandy and Looby Lou, only they have fewer
entertaining ideas. Don't be sick with Anne and Nick would be my guiding
principle.
On the ITV side there were Richard and Judy, just as forced fun and as bland as
beefless burger.
But this lot is just for starters. It is in the afternoons when daytime
television reveals all. Or rather ordinary people do - to Oprah, on several
channels, to Esther, to Ricki.
They are encouraged to confess in public how they slept with their husband's
best pal, went to live on a desert island, couldn't handle being teenagers, had
beaten their budgies and now believe that all men are beasts.
OK, a lot of these shows are American but they are being shown by our
television companies, the ones we always claim provide the finest service in
the world. Frankly I think they are the worst kind of tabloid time-filling, an
insult to the housebound, shift workers, or anyone else who has to be at home
during daylight hours.I was reaching for the book when the mega-story broke.
Princess Di was going to appear on screen to tell all. ``My life of hell with
Chuck'', ``How HM made me eat kippers at Balmoral'', ``The day I discovered
Will's dummy''. There will be no sleeping when this moll sets out her stall.
She will start, of course, on prestige Panorama. But everything she says will
be taken down, dissected, debated, debunked by Kilroy, Judy, Richard, Ricki,
Anne, Nick, and all the other purveyors of pap for weeks on end.
I am sorry for the Prince and Princess of Wales, as I am for any other couple
whose marriage has gone wrong. But that sympathy is much diluted by their
insistence, like guests on any of a thousand chattering shows, on justifying
themselves before the great god television.
Whatever Diana says on Monday, even if it is only ``OK ya'', she will not
emerge with an enhanced reputation. The putative Queen follows the would-be
King on to the hot television seat - ``if you have a question, call this
freephone number'' - and in doing so they may both be throwing away a throne.
I do not expect those who would reign over us to lead lives of absolute moral
rectitude. After all, they never did. But I do not wish them, by their own
decision, to wash the royal linen on screen.
Watching Charles squirming on his chair, mangling vowels along the way, as he
told us he had been unfaithful, is not part of the unwritten contract he has
with Britain. His estranged wife, who may be very kind to young children and
animals, has been proved to possess the intellectual capacity of a goldfish.
They are selfish, silly people who take little regard for the cruelty they are
both inflicting on their offspring.
This branch of the House of Windsor may be the first live suicides on
television. For I believe the country is heartily sick of their antics.
Those like myself who favour the continuation of the monarchy can only hope
that the Princess Royal might succeed her mother, at least until the young
Princes are tried and tested.
But they must promise, in the Coronation Oath, to avoid daytime television.

IT'S not quite all change at Hambros, where bad debts of #23.5m - mostly on old
loans - and exceptional charges of #8.8m have left a first-half loss of #7.7m
before tax against a profit #21.5m last time, but the group is striving to put
up defensive barriers and at the same time concentrating on those activities in
which it can grow.
Given the takeovers that have already taken place in the merchant banking
market place Hambros is regarded as vulnerable although its main shareholder,
the Italian Gruppo Bancario San Paolo, signalled its support for the company
saying that it intended to boost its stake to around 20% from its present
14.12% by buying in the market.
The Italians also own 32.9% of the convertible share capital, and according to
Sir Chips Keswick, who has been appointed chief executive of the group and
non-executive chairman of Hambros Bank, shares the company's vision of the
future of Hambros as an independent bank. Aside from Sir Chips, a fairly
extensive boardroom shuffle also sees Christopher Sporborg relinquishing his
position as chairman and chief executive of Hambro Group Investments and
retiring from the board of Hambros bank to concentrate on his role as chairman
of Hambro Countrywide and Hambro Insurance Services.
Hambros chairman Lord Hambro says that competitive pressures in the main areas
in which the company operates have remained intense, and exceptional costs have
been absorbed in the first phase of reorganising a number of its businesses.
Shareholders also see their interim dividend reduced from 4.5p to 2.5p and a
final of 5p is forecast to give an unchanged total of 7.5p, albeit this is half
the 1993-94 payout.
Under its strategic review, Hambros has been cutting back some of its banking
activities including the equities clearing business and Australian
stockbroking. In addition, treasury operations have been slimmed down both in
the UK and Australia.
The company's residential mortgage portfolio has also been sold, though at a
substantial premium.
On the investment management side, Hambros intends to seek opportunities to
enlarge funds whether by joint venture or acquisitions.
Benefits from the the company's ``new approach'' are expected to begin to show
themselves by the the end of its financial year. But in the meantime profits in
the current year will remain depressed as changes take place.

SAMANTHA Smith, the 1994 Scottish Champion, kept the British flag flying in the
Texaco Women's Challenger Event in Edinburgh when she upset seventh seed
Adriana Gersi to book her place on today's quarter-final.
The 23-year-old from Essex, who survived two match points during her 2-6, 6-2,
7-5 first round victory over qualifier Julie Pullin, trailed the Czech 4-2 in
the first set before reeling off six games in a row to establish a 2-0 lead in
the second. Smith, ranked 145 places below Gersi at 365 on the WTA computer,
broke serve again in the fifth game and went on to clinch a 6-4, 6-2 victory to
set up a clash with top seed Sandra Kleinova. The Czech teenager was extended
to a second set tie-break before edging past Ukrainian Nelly Barkan 6-2, 7-6
yesterday.
Exeter left hander Karen Cross and Jo Ward, last year's national champion,
failed to survive the second round. Cross, the British No.3, posed few problems
for big serving Sabine Gerke, a German qualifier, who has yet to drop a set in
five matches in the $25,000 tournament. Gerke's 6-1, 6-3 victory earns her a
clash with third seed Marion Maruska, who won eight successive games from 5-3
down to beat Ward 7-5, 6-0.

PLANS for a national stadium for shinty appear to be heading for touch, with
cold water being poured on the proposal that Fort William be considered as a
venue. The plan will go before Lochaber District Council's leisure and
recreation committee at the start of next week.
The proposal, to upgrade the facilities which have already housed the Camanachd
Cup Final and this season's international against the Irish, would need the
backing of the Camanachd Association to succeed.
Association president Duncan Cameron said yesterday: ``We do not have any plans
at the moment for such a venue and, quite frankly, I doubt if it would attract
the sort of support needed to proceed.
``There is no agreement, it appears to me, where that venue would be. Such a
move would also require changes to our constitution, which requires us to take
the game's showpiece, the Camanachd Cup final, round a series of venues. I
cannot see clubs voting to alter that for a single venue as things stand.''
Meanwhile, Fort William is the venue for the First Shinty festival a week on
Sunday - a modified version of the game, played on a smaller pitch, with a
larger, softer ball and lighter sticks with rubber heads.
This weekend's main action centres on the only premier game lost to the weather
this season, Oban Camanachd's match away to Newtonmore.
Fort William face Strathglass in a replay of their Keyline MacAulay cup-tie.The
pick of the league matches this weekend are at Perth in south division one,
where runaway leaders Kyles are the visitors, and at Spean Bridge in the north,
where the league leaders Caberfeidh face a crucial match against Lochaber.

ALMOST #500,000 is being spent to attract Christmas shoppers to Glasgow.
Shine On Glasgow, a programme of street entertainment, will begin on Sunday,
November 26, with a parade before the Christmas lights in George Square are
switched on.
The Shine On programme, unveiled for the first time last year, is a partnership
between city-centre retailers and local authorities. Funding this year comes
from Glasgow City Council (#170,000), Strathclyde Regional Council (#50,000),
and Glasgow Development Agency (#50,000).
A further cash injection has come from Coca Cola, which this year is
contributing ``more than #100,000'' in cash and sponsorship-in-kind. A further
#60,000 is to be raised from city centre retailers, shopping centres, and
hotels who are members of Glasgow City Centre Association.
Mr Bill Neish, the association's chairman, said the programme brought clear
economic benefits. Last year, when events were scheduled for the Sundays in the
run-up to Christmas, trade had increased by 17% on three of the four Sundays
and hotels in the city were almost full.
This year, there will be events every day for a month, beginning on Sunday when
Coca Cola hosts an Alternative Christmas Party in George Square with music from
Ultimate Kaos, the Night Crawlers, and soap star turned pop star Sean Maguire.
Ms Jane Webb, Coca Cola's business development manager, said her company has
paid for the commissioning of three new structures for Glasgow's pedestrian
areas, two of which will be temporary performance spaces.
Argyle Street will have a six and a half metre Orrery - a steel and neon
sculpture depicting the movement of the planets and stars, made by Julian Goss
at Glasgow Sculpture Studios.
A 17-metre steel Christmas Tree capable of accomodating a gospel choir will be
placed at the bottom of Buchanan Street. It has been designed by city
architects Richardson Associates.
A five-metre cuckoo clock, by Steve Edgar, Graeme Gilmour, and Simon Hopkins at
the sculpture studios, for Sauchiehall Street includes a revolving stage for
performances limited to fifteen minutes.
Mr Alastair Wyllie, director of Shine On, said the aim of the project was to
promote Glasgow as the UK's Christmas shopping capital. Packages are being
offered to visitors through the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and special
travel deals have been negotiated.
At the switching on of the Christmas Lights, to be performed by Burgomeister Dr
Pieter Schonlein, mayor of Nuremberg, in recognition of the 10th anniversary of
the twinning link between the two cities, 850,000 stars will be launched into
the air at George Square, one for every Glasgow citizen.

About 97% of the Provident Mutual policyholders voted in favour of the move at

Completion of the deal remains conditional on court approval, expected in late
December. Recommending acceptance of the General Accident bid six weeks ago,
the Provident Mutual board warned that the life assurance company would face

TARMAC and George Wimpey are swapping assets in a deal worth almost #700m,
aimed at focusing each group on a core market.
In the case of Wimpey this is housebuilding and in the case of Tarmac, heavy
building products including aggregates and services.
Following a strategic review Wimpey has decided to withdraw from contracting
and minerals in order to focus exclusively on housing and land development. As
such it has agreed in principle to exchange its construction and minerals
division for Tarmac's housing division which includes McLean Homes in Scotland.
The deal is expected to be an earnings enhancement for Wimpey in the first full
year. Tarmac does not anticipate any dilution of its 1996 earnings.
As a result of the asset swap, as many as 4000 Wimpey employees will move to
Tarmac and 2000 Tarmac employees will transfer to Wimpey. There are likely to
be as yet undisclosed redundancies once the rationalisation of the merged
businesses gets underway.
Tarmac's housing business has been on the market since August. Talks between
the companies began with about a month ago. Commenting on the transaction
Neville Simms, Tarmac group chief executive, said that transferring the housing
division ``to a company which is committed to private sector housebuilding will
provide the best opportunity for the future of the business and its employees''.
Given the perilous state of the UK housing market it may seem an odd decision
to focus a company entirely on housing. Indeed, yesterday Wimpey said that
since its interim statement in September, market conditions had deteriorated in
both housing and construction.
Wimpey's trading profits for the year are expected to be materially lower than
the 1994 level and pre-tax profits substantially lower. Housing completions are
expected to be 7500 although the need for incentives to attract buyers
adversely affected margins.
However Mr Dwyer said that Wimpey's housing business had always been a major
contributor to profits and that it was extremely cash generative. Around a
third of Wimpey's assets are turned into cash each year. He is optimistic about
the group's prospects in 1996.
Last year, Wimpey was the UK's largest housebuilder. Its housing stock is
geared towards first time buyers, with an average selling price of #60,000.
The acquired Tarmac housing business is in the second time buyer market with an
average selling price of around #80,000 and so provides a complementary fit
with Wimpey's existing business. Both concerns are to run as separate
stand-alone entities.
Following the merger Wimpey will consolidate its position as Britain's largest
housebuilder with a market share of around 10%, twice that of its nearest
rivals Beazer and Barratt.
However, there are unikely to be any monopoly at this level. Wimpey will also
be one of the world's largest housing and land development groups.
The deal, which is expected to be formally signed early next year, was welcomed
by the City. Wimpey's shares added 15p to 127p while Tarmac gained 9p to 92!sp.

SCOTLAND'S cocky, fresh-faced footballers, as represented by the Under-21 side,
can look forward to testing their growing reputation against the very best
young players in Europe when the draw for the European Championship
quarter-finals is made today in Geneva.
The quality of the opposition is such that any one of the seven countries who
will go into the hat alongside the Scots will provide a formidable task.
The names alone will very nearly be sufficient - France, Germany, Italy,
Hungary, Czech Republic, Spain, and Portugal - to tell the tale, but the
current Under-21 record of these sides, a level at which they have always been
exceptional, demonstrates the talent at their disposal. However, Scotland's own
performance in Group 8 shows that they have a fair bit of ability themselves.
In fact, the Scots' record of winning seven of their eight games is better than
any of the other qualifiers in their groups, although some did very nearly as
well against tough opposition.
Portugal, for example, did not lose a game in their section, which included
England, drawing twice and winning six times.
Germany, as ever, will be hard to tackle, as they showed in the deciding game
of their section on Tuesday, when they beat their only challengers, Bulgaria,
7-0 in Bonn.
The Czech's growing stature in the international arena was confirmed by their
young side's success in a group that contained Holland and Norway, while
another east European country, Hungary, left Sweden, among others, behind in
their section.
France's group was perhaps the most competitive, with Romania, Poland and
Slovakia all serious challengers at various stages. Spain had to beat off
Denmark and Belgium to get this far, while Italy left it a bit late to secure
their place, making it narrowly after drawing 0-0 with Lithuania at home
yesterday.
Every one a winner, for sure, but Scotland's manager, Tommy Craig, will not be
quaking at the prospect of facing any of them. ``Obviously, when you see the
teams involved you can expect everybody to be wary of the talent on show, but I
think we have done enough in our group for the others to be a bit wary of us
now,'' he said, not unreasonably. What Craig does promise is a complete
commitment to attacking play, in the away leg as well as at home, which he
believes was the key to the fine run in the group.
``It is nice for this group to be among the cream of Europe,'' he said, ``but I
would take this squad anywhere in the world and I know they would put on a show
and maybe win. We will play the same way no matter who we get.''
The man who is also assistant manager at Aberdeen has used 34 players in the
campaign, never having fielded the same side twice, but after the defeat by
Finland in the opening tie the chosen 11 did the job anyway.
The defeat of San Marino on Tuesday completed the first stage of the Under-21's
journey into Europe, but now it gets even more tricky.

SMITH'S Band can ensure a familiar set of colours are seen in the winner's
enclosure tomorrow after the Hamilton Litestat Handicap Chase at Wincanton.
Owner Arthur Smith is one of Jenny Pitman's longest-standing patrons and has
enjoyed success with Smith's Man in the Topham Trophy and Smith's Cracker in
the Philip Cornes Saddle of Gold Final in the past decade.
Smith's Band has the makings of a useful handicapper. Like many of his
stable-mates, he left modest hurdling form behind him when sent over fences
last term and picked up novice events at Stratford, Leicester and Cheltenham.
That was despite some less than fluent jumping which saw him come to grief two
out at Kempton in February and prevented his landing a blow in the Sun Alliance
Novices' Chase at Cheltenham the following month.
One of Smith's Band's stable-companions is honoured at Warwick, where the
feature race is the Willsford Handicap Chase, named after last Saturday's
Cheltenham winner who has scored five times on this course.
Though Mrs Pitman will have hopes of landing the prize with Mailcom, he'll
certainly do well to concede nearly a stone to Maamur, a potentially smart
chaser.
q COULDNT Be Better threw down the gauntlet to Hennessy hotpot One Man
yesterday with a satisfactory comeback at Haydock Park.
The gelding's odds were cut to 7-1 from 14s by William Hill and 9-1 from 11s by
Ladbrokes for the big Newbury handicap after defeating Chatam by two lengths in
the Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase.
Chatam, also putting up a creditable performance on his seasonal debut, is 12-1
with William Hill and 16-1 with Ladbrokes, but One Man remains a rock-solid
favourite at7-4 with both firms.

HOLDERS Denmark, who ended their group matches with a 3-1 home win over
Armenia, and newcomers Croatia, were among the latest qualifiers for the
European championship finals yesterday.
Germany, the only team to have won the trophy twice, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey,
Italy, and Scotland also joined hosts England and the previously qualified
Spain, Russia and Switzerland in the finals for next June.
Turkey, who drew 2-2 away to Sweden in their last match in Group 3, have
reached the finals of a major tournament for the first time since the 1954
World Cup. Romania, inspired by their World Cup midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, and
Germany went through by winning their groups, as had former champions Spain and
Russia.
Captain Jurgen Klinsmann scored twice, his second a penalty, as the Germans
came from behind to beat Bulgaria 3-1.
Parma's Hristo Stoichkov put the Bulgarians ahead just after half time, only
for Klinsmann to equalise three minutes later. Thomas Haessler put the Germans
in front after 56 minutes and Klinsmann added a penalty in 76 minutes.
The Bulgarians qualified as runners-up, although other earlier results in their
group had already made sure they reached the finals before kick-off.
The Danes, who finished second in Group 2 behind Spain, made sure their
runners-up record was good enough to be among the six best second-placed teams
and avoid a play-off next month for the remaining finals' berth.
Real Madrid's Michael Laudrup was among the Danish scorers as was Sevilla's
Davor Suker for Croatia in their away match against neighbours Slovenia.
Croatia were another team to have qualified before they defeated Slovenia by
2-1 in Ljubljana, other results ensuring that if they ended the night only as
runners-up in Group 4, in which Italy also won, defeatingLithuania 4-0, their
record was good enough to avoid the play-off. Italy's goals all came in the
second half through a Gianfranco Zola hat trick following an own goal.
Results in Scotland's Group 8 went much as expected.
Greece defeated the Faroe Islands 5-0 at home in Iraklion with a second-half
rush of goals starting in 58 minutes through Alexis Alexandris. Themistocles
Nikolaides in 62, Nikos Mahlas (66), George Gonis (75), and Vassilis Tsartas
(80) completed the rout.
In Moscow, Russia maintained their top form, defeating Finland 3-1. The
Russians went ahead through Dmitry Radchenko five minutes before the break, but
the Finns hit back just on half-time through Kim Suominen. However, Vasily
Kulkov after 55 minutes, and Sergei Kiryakov in 70 minutes, gave the home side
a comfortable win.
Over in Limassol, Cyprus shocked Belgium when Narios Agathocleus put them ahead
after 18 minutes in their Group 2 qualifying match. Two minutes later, Marios
Charalambous was sent off, but the Cypriots held out until the sixty-sixth
minute when Gilles de Bilde equalised.
Moldova beat Georgia 3-2 in Group 7 in fog so thick it was almost impossible to
watch.Meanwhile Northern Ireland's amazing 5-3 victory in Group 6 over Austria
at Windsor Park, Belfast, ensured that the Republic of Ireland, despite their
3-0 defeat in Portugal, would be in the finals' play-off match at Anfield on
December 13 against Holland, who defeated Norway 3-0 in Rotterdam, while France
also qualified with a 2-0 Group 1 victory over Israel.

SINCE becoming chairman of Unigate in March, Ian Martin has transformed the
dairy products group from one performing adequately into one poised to become a
significant player in the European food industry.
Net debt at the end of September amounted to #174m. But that is being
transformed so that Unigate will have cash balances by the year-end of #200m
and perhaps #250m once it sells off its US restaurants business.
That is being achieved through the now completed disposal of the US arm of the
Giltspur exhibition division for #40m and yesterday's decision to sell the 29%
holding in the Nutricia babyfood business in Holland for around #320m.
The actual amount will depend upon the success of the book-building exercise by
SBC Warburg and ABN AMRO.
Dundee-born Mr Martin was the driving force behind Grand Metropolitan's
acquisition of the Pillsbury foods group in the US which also brought in Burger
King. His track record augurs well for Unigate.
In the half-year, pre-tax profits rose 12.5% to #60.4m on turnover 16.9% ahead
at #1043m.
However, doorstep deliveries of milk in England tumbled 18% following upon a
17% decline in the preceding year as the price margin widened against the
supermarket product. The expectation is that it will reach the Scottish level
of 25% in the pretty near future and so Unigate has been cutting back packaging
capacity.
It is hoped that Unigate's supermarket milk margins will improve - they now
take 60% of deliveries - but possibly not too much should be expected.
Divisional profits eased #2m to #16.5m
Much more positive were the fresh food activities. There was a 65% advance in
profits to #24.5m with half the increase due to two French acquisitions which
supply yoghurt and butter-type spreads.
The core St Ivel ranges saw gains in spreads helped by ``Utterly Butterly'' and
in chilled products although the star performance in the division came from
Malton Bacon which found markets across the world as far afield as Japan and
Korea.
The Wincanton fleet distribution subsidiary was effectively flat at #10.6m with
milk haulage a dull spot, offsetting new contract gains from retailers such as
Kwik Save and Courage.
That activity is now a small part of the whole but is regarded as being an
integral part of the group.
One side-effect of the Giltspur deal is that Unigate will lose perhaps #5m of
profits in the current half year.
Full year pre-tax profits seem set to rise from #117m, before a #58.3m
exceptional charge last year, to about #124m.
That would leave the shares at 432p trading at about 11 times earnings which
does seem cheap on operating grounds while not allowing anything for what Mr
Martin will contribute.
The interim dividend has been increased 5.6% to 6.65p. A total of 20p would
produce an attractive 5.8% yield.

A SCOTTISH Labour MP protests at the de-commissioning of a nuclear submarine.
This, he complained, would reduce Britain's nuclear arsenal. New Labour, it
appears, is now a more vigorous advocate of nuclear weaponry than the Tories.
A Scottish Labour MP outlined New Labour's plan to force unemployed youngsters
to go on ``training'' courses. Youngsters who have been on various gimmicks
before and are still unemployed might well say, ``Gies a job but stuff your
gimmicks'' and then have their already meagre benefits slashed by a New Labour
government. If the Tories had any sense they would have included this in the
Queen's Speech. It is, after all, their kind of thinking.
A North of England Labour MP says that if the Government introduces tax cuts in
the forthcoming Budget Labour should support them. The health service is in
crisis. If we have a cruel winter more pensioners will die of hypothermia.
Serious social problems endanger the fabric of our social life. And back at
Westminster the Government squalidly pursues cuts in social provisions to fund
tax cuts for the don't-give-a-damn greedy.
Will this MP's worthiness as a Labour candidate be challenged by the Labour
leader, as he did the worthiness of Liz Davies? The answer is no. One thing is
certain. If there are tax cuts in the Budget, New Labour's attitude will be
determined by tactical considerations, principles won't come into it.
Blair attacks Major for lurching to the right, which really is rich. He is the
most right-wing Labour leader there has ever been, including Ramsay MacDonald.
MacDonald joined the Tories. Tories now join New Labour.
Blair is a master of the ambiguous. Rory Bremner makes a telling point about
his rhetoric. He perorates. New Labour. New Britain. New Labour Britain. New
Start. New Start - New Labour. His mantras are verbless. Missing are words
which promise or indicate the performance of an action. New Labour's action man
is verbally actionless, except when ditching Labour principles.
In his conference speech he was absolutely specific about one thing, he did a
deal with British Telecom to let this company, the third biggest in Britain,
have access to cable. John Major, Tory Prime Minister, then lectures the leader
of New Labour on the dangers of such an awesome concentration of power in the
hands of a private capitalist monopoly.
Pause for a moment. Think of it. A Tory Prime Minister has to warn a Labour
leader about the dangers of capitalist monopolies. The same Labour leader then
accuses the same Tory Prime Minister of lurching to the right.
Mr Blair spoke this week to the national conference of the CBI, and there is
nothing wrong with that. Business is a vital component of any society and the
captains of industry are important, but so are others. Workers are important,
without them there is no industry.
Blair's speech to the CBI was cooing, wooing, placatory, reassuring about
taxes. He was speaking to companies which have bankrolled the Tory party for
years. New Labour. New Britain. Nothing to worry about.
Compare this with his speech to the TUC. Bambi then becomes John Wayne.
Straight talking. Shooting from the hip. A man's got to do . . . The unions pay
millions into Labour's coffers. Then they are told in cooingless and wooingless
words that they can expect no favours from his government. Fair enough, the
unions should tell him, more graciously, that his government should not expect
too many favours from them.
Long before Blair and New Labour I had come to the conclusion that trade unions
should play a more independent political role because the interests of their
members and their families were often fundamentally affected, one way or
another, by the decisions of all governments.
In the 1970s trade union leaders did get too involved in quasi-governmental
institutions. At the time I argued that if trade union leaders wanted to play a
part in governing the country they should resign their union posts and stand
for Parliament.
The danger of such involvement is not that unions dominate government, but that
government dominates the union. Free trade unions, like the judiciary, have to
be independent of government, all governments, any government.
Unions might campaign for Labour in a General Election but if Labour is elected
then a principled distance has to be maintained between the two. If not one
suborns the other, and I know who does the suborning.
Trade unions should be campaigning for their own specific political objectives,
including union rights and a raft of social demands which would benefit their
members. They should be raising these with all political parties, reaching out
to new allies in the civic life of the nation. Not to do so is a dereliction of
professional duty.
Many trade unionists are not Labour Party members, some are not even Labour
voters. There is no reason why trade union political demands should conform to
Labour policies. There is no reason why they shouldn't go beyond Labour
policies. In present circumstances there is every reason why they must do so.
A New Labour government is likely to introduce constitutional reforms that will
lead to the state funding of political parties. New Labour will then seek to
sever its organic links with the trade unions. Such links will be deemed
incompatible with the electoral expectations of a party that now recognises no
special links with the working class or wage earners, which is true.
I think New Labour will be the losers, not the unions, for unions have an
objective existence in society whatever the fortunes of political parties. On
the other hand the union link is Labour's roots among wage earners, even among
those wage earners who aren't union members, and among the working class in
general. It's a matter of deep-rooted ideas, psychology, class community, and a
sense of identity and belonging that defines who, and what, we are.
I have no time for the ultra left but the ultra right are worse, and more cold
blooded. There is talk of an emerging consensus, within the higher echelons of
the British Establishment, that the economy can no longer afford the welfare
state, that a Tory government would not be allowed to dismantle the welfare
state, but a Blair government, driven by the internal logic of its own
right-wing rationale, could and would. A chilling thought.

GOOD to see Scotland at last claiming its rightful place in the Third World
thanks to the Chunghwa Picture Tube Company of Taiwan - proof, if any were ever
required, that we never really needed Ravenscraig in the first place, and clear
evidence that we should all be bending over backwards to show what a flexible
workforce we are.
After all, what with Motorola's earlier decision to invest $375m in East
Kilbride, the tube deal, promising 3300 new full-time jobs over the next four
years, has attracted international attention. Even our friends in the German
press have had their attention drawn to ``die staatliche schottische
Wirtschaftsfvrderungsgesellschaft Locate in Scotland'', and in the US, not
least, the word is out.
There, Steven Bennett, LIS's director for North America, said in a press
release yesterday: ``These announcements by Motorola and Chunghwa represent the
latest in a number of very significant inward investment successes for Scotland
over the past year and confirm Scotland's position as the leading electronic
location in Europe.''
Very true. But just so that other potential overseas investors are under no
illusions, the release explains: ``Locate in Scotland is the economic
development agency for the Scottish government.''
It would be far too decent of us to fail to add that the release was
``prepared, edited, issued or (sic) circulated by Al Paul Lefton Company, Inc .
. . which is registered with the Department of Justice, Washington, DC, under
the Foreign Agents Registrations Act as an agent of Locate In Scotland''.
Now that's what we call a Wirtschaftsfvrderungsgesellschaft.
Naked ambition
NO DOUBT it's the Scottish Tourist Board's job to become wildly excited over
anything that might conceivably sell the country to visitors. No doubt
Braveheart, Rob Roy, and Ted Danson's forthcoming Loch Ness will be splendid
promotional tools.
We do, however, counsel just a little caution over the STB's apparent
enthusiasm for the Hollywood term ``kilt movies'' in its embrace of the Nessie
flick. As any tourist knows, the kilt may look splendid, but isn't it the case
that all too often there is nothing very much underneath it?
Signs of the times
ON matching blackboards on either side of the entrance to an Edinburgh pub -
``Cocktails #2 . . . Student meals #2.25''.
Let them eat dry martinis?
Gold-plated
ANOTHER in our occasional series of little-known but deeply fascinating facts:
since the first car registration number sale in 1989 #182m has been raised for
the Treasury from 370,000 of the sort of sad citizens who think it the very
height of comedy to have things like 1 PRAT on their bumpers. We know this
because we have to hand the catalogue for a ``public auction of attractive
vehicle registration numbers'' to be held at Glasgow's SECC on Sunday as part
of the Scottish Motor Show. Now this is funny.
Turning to the ``more money than sense'' section we find, for example, that the
guide price for the immortal 9 HA is a mere #3300, that patriots among you can
secure 2 NAT for only #2700, and that for the litigant in your life there is,
at #3200, 200 SUE. The ``special guest'' at the show will be former rugby
captain Gavin Hastings who could, if he wished, be driving around with 15 GAV
for just #2300.
As the organisers explain, ``a strange culture surrounds auctions'', not least
when number plates can often be worth more than the cars on which they are
displayed, but the DVLA - marketing itself as ``DVLA Classic Collection'' -
isn't complaining. You are, however, advised to take along your bank manager
``to stop yourself getting carried away'' by the Ministry of Transport's
``surprisingly reasonable'' prices.
By the way, the show's catalogue (a snip at #7, or 7 WHIT) goes to commendable
lengths to advertise Greater Glasgow, ``Gateway to Scotland'', as ``one of the
most exciting holiday destinations in the United Kingdom''. There are pictures
of the Botanic Gardens, the Royal Concert Hall, the City Chambers, and the
Italian Centre. Funnily enough, however, someone has forgotten to include a
snap of the gorgeous SECC.
One-man ban
MEANWHILE, agonising times for Britain's Euro-Tories struggling with that
unaccustomed experience, a moral dilemma. Thus a press conference, chaired by
Glenys Kinnock, is held in Strasbourg to discuss Ken Wiwa's demands for
sanctions against Shell after the execution of his father. Lord Plum, leader of
the Tory group, and Edward McMillan-Scott, MEP for York, are pressed for their
views.
His lordship hums a bit, then follows it up with a little hawing, only to have
his non-Nigerian gas put at a peep by his trenchant colleague.
Not only does McMillan-Scott support a boycott, he is, he says, already
conducting his own, heroic one-man campaign.
That this might not be the agreed party line is clear from Lord Plum's face. As
the meeting disperses, however, he asks his Tory friend just what he'll do when
he runs out of petrol with only a Shell station in the neighbourhood. No
problem, says, McMillan-Scott; always keep a gallon drum in the boot.
But of what, we wonder. Esso? BP?
Navel manoeuvres
A CLIPPING from the Wall Street Journal is passed to us, and on the principle
that anything good enough for the voice of capitalism is good enough for the
Diary, we offer without comment a report that the number of bellybutton
reconstructions in Japan went up 375% in the past year.
According to the piece, many Japanese have come to believe that ``the navel is
the core of everything about the person''. Or as the president of a Tokyo
hospital put it, ``People want navels that aren't assertive.''
If the Journal is to be believed, the perfect navel is ``vertical, very narrow,
and absolutely symmetrical''. It is also said to be a popular theme in the
Japanese language. For example, a favourite insult among the young is, ``Your
mother has an outie.''
Wonderful people, the Japanese.

WILLIAM RUSSELL finds the new 007 format has a grittier edge, without losing
its sense of fun
MARTIN Campbell is under no illusions. By the end of November he will know
whether he goes down in cinema history as The Man who killed 007. The
little-known Campbell, a New Zealander, who came to Britain in 1966 to work as
a video cameraman, has directed the seventeenth James Bond movie, Goldeneye,
which opens on November 22 with a new Bond, Pierce Brosnan. His track record as
a director, particularly in television, does not make him an obvious choice to
resurrect the cold war spy.
It is six years since the last Bond film, Licence to Kill, starring Timothy
Dalton, and there were genuine fears that 007's day had gone. But Campbell did
direct that highly regarded television political thriller Edge of Darkness, and
maybe it was that which led to his selection. Since then he has worked mainly
in America and most of his films have not crossed the Atlantic.
The problem for Bond - and Campbell - is that in those six years new heroes and
new styles of action film have emerged. Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Bruce Willis
have taken over as the role model for invincible heroes, especially when it
comes to spectacular stunts. Another pre-production problem was that the
former's hugely successful True Lies proved remarkably similar to the plans the
Bond people had for Goldeneye. A long hard look followed.
The 15-minute clip of scenes from the film - it is still being edited - which I
have seen reveals that Brosnan is second to none, or possibly only Connery,
when it comes to wearing a dinner jacket. The Irish man has the style and
handles the double entendres with a delicacy to match that shown by Roger Moore.
The fight scenes have been spectacularly staged; there is a bungee jump which
takes the breath away and will have the Die Hard people wondering why they did
not think of it first, and a chase through the streets, canals and buildings of
St Petersburg with Bond in a Russian tank, which is something completely new.
The old ingredients are also there. The luscious Bond women are played by
foreign actresses nobody has heard of, and, judging by past experience, may
never do again, while the supporting villains are also played by continental
heavies.
The principal villain, 006, a renegade British agent called Trevelyan, is
played by the blonde, smooth, Nordic Sean Bean, a perfect counterpart to
Brosnan's swarthy, hirsute Celt. As for M, she is played by Dame Judi Dench,
and it looks inspired casting. The scene I saw in which she tells 007 just what
she thinks of him is splendidly funny as she gets across the point that for her
he is a macho male dinosaur whose day is over. If the late Bernard Lee was
irreplaceable, and he was, then this is the way to replace him.
How did Campbell tackle such a sacred bull of a movie hero? ``You just grit
your teeth and get on with it,'' he said. ``Because we had a new Bond we could
start again, and that was good. The action is tougher and grittier than in
previous Bond films and it is also much faster paced, but there are still
plenty of groan lines - you don't want to tamper with those, they are part of
the tradition - and Pierce was made for the role. The suggestion that it might
have gone to Mel Gibson is rubbish. Pierce was always going to be Bond. He was
going to play him before but could not for contractual reasons. I looked at the
tests he made then, and he seemed too young, but now he is just right.''
Campbell said he had devised most of the stunts, especially the tank chase, and
had found the Russians in St Petersburg, where it was shot, extremely helpful
and efficient.
``The final fight between Bond and Trevelyan is pretty tough and the actors did
it all, except for one shot,'' he said. ``I think the series could have died a
natural death after the last Dalton film, and yes, I could go down as the man
who killed James Bond. We will have to wait and see.''
Among the villains are two Scots, Robbie Coltrane, sporting a ludicrous Scots
Russian accent, as a former KGB boss turned arms dealer, and Alan Cumming as
Boris, a crooked computer operator, while American actor Joe Don Baker appears
as a CIA man. He was in the fifteenth Bond film, The Living Daylights, playing
one of the villains, which just goes to show anything is possible in movies. As
for the title song, composed by Bono of U2, it will be sung by Tina Turner.
All the indications are that this time the Bond cocktail has been both shaken
and stirred. But Campbell is not banking on making the eighteenth Bond movie
just yet.

The fresh management structure
is seen as building on the strength
of what existed before, while continuing
the high standards of quality
CREATED by the restructuring of the Henry Boot construction group and
inheriting an already established role as one of the leaders in the Scottish
construction industry, the new Henry Boot Scotland Division takes over, led by
a new team and reorganised in ways which they believe will make for a stronger
position in the highly competitive industry.
``We are also determined to continue the award-winning quality service for
which the company is renowned,'' said James Andrew, who has been appointed
divisional director for Scotland under the restructuring programme.
``Our basic code is to ensure that each contract is delivered on time, to
budget, and complying with our client's specified requirements. At the moment
this is an ever changing marketplace, but we do see green shoots of recovery
and a sense of more activity.
``We are well positioned to take advantage of that, particularly because as the
Scottish division, we have a broad base for activities.'' The established Henry
Boot office in Glasgow will continue to control all the new division's building
and civil engineering projects in Scotland.
``Our immediate aims are established,'' said James Andrew. ``Our new team have
set clear goals for management to achieve, and will measure progress towards
these goals. We have plans to further invest in staff, computerisation and
training - it amounts to providing the correct means to allow the various
disciplines within the business to operate as effectively and as efficiently as
possible.
``That in turn will help towards providing a quality service to the contract
sites, and in turn help them to achieve their project commitments to clients.''
The new Henry Boot structure, decided on by company managing director John
Burbidge, brought together all the group's previous UK contracting operations
carried out by Henry Boot Construction Ltd and Henry Boot Scotland Ltd.
The new company, Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd, merges contracting
activities and completes overall restructuring which began in l994.
The Scottish division, led by James Andrew, has already met a welcome from many
existing clients and from new inquiries. The fresh management structure is seen
as building on the strength of what existed before, while continuing the high
standards of quality.
``Our approach to quality takes many forms,'' said the Scottish division's
marketing manager, Andrew Aitken. ``Currently, for instance, we are working
towards achieving ISO 9000 quality accreditation. We are further strengthening
our existing very strong company training policy. We believe in training, we
invest in it, and we have eight training centres throughout Scotland for the
provision of training to the industry.
``We train Henry Boot staff and site personnel in a wide variety of operations
including machinery and safety. We also give training in various skills at
management level.'' The new Scottish division, autonomous in its activities, is
initially expected to be responsible for around 25% of the group's turnover,
then will grow from there as the company grows.
Its activities cover a very wide spectrum from main line building to housing
stock refurbishment for local authorities and housing associations. Special
projects come under the banner of ``design and construct'' and other
procurement methods, and can include management contracting. Civil engineering
projects are carried out under the banner of design and construct or as
traditional contracts.
Henry Boot activities in Scotland range from road building to major water
plants, from defence contracts to new hospitals, from the special skills
required in refurbishment of major buildings to new general building.
``It is difficult to talk about ``special strength'' areas,'' said Andrew
Aitken. ``But we have a wide range of repeat clients who recognise that our
skills and experience include both major engineering work and major, and often
complex, refurbishing in all its forms. That has been amply recognised by the
many top industry awards that we have received.'' Like Scottish divisional
director James Andrew, he sees many practical benefits from the new divisional
structure.
``In marketing terms we are now stronger than ever. As part of a bigger group
we can apply for larger contracts. In addition, we now have a much stronger
financial base and we also have all the benefits of day to day communications
of a larger organisation. Service departments are centralised in terms of man
management, and the people we have here at Scottish headquarters are committed
to the sites.
``In the same way, our decision to instal a more advanced computer system is
already adding more rationalised strength to the organisation - and the
resulting integration of the various disciplines providing service to the sites
brings about savings in time and cost and also brings improved efficiency.
``We achieve more time to study information, to identify and deal with
potential problems - all of which is to our clients' benefit.''

HEADED by Scottish division director James Andrew, the new Henry Boot team for
Scotland is drawn from existing staff and backed by a skilled and long-serving
workforce.
Colin J Carrick is divisional surveyor, with Andrew Aitken as divisional
marketing manager. Other key members of the team include G K Smelt, special
projects manager, design and build; S Milligan, contracts manager, civil
engineering; J H Ferguson, contracts manager, new build construction; and A
Herd, contracts manager, housing and refurbishment.
When Henry Boot, the founder of the company, died in 1931 it was taken over by
Charles, the eldest of his three sons. Family control has continued and today
non-executive chairman is David Henry Boot, and another family member, Edward
James Boot, is group managing director.

PROVEN all-round skills lie behind Henry Boot Scotland being awarded a #20.5m
contract by Central Regional Council for a new water treatment plant which has
begun building at Broadside in Denny, Stirlingshire.
The contract is for the design, construction and commissioning of the treatment
works, which will take thirty months to complete.
``The contract is to be undertaken in partnership with PWT Projects Ltd, a
subsidiary of Thames Water, which will provide technology to meet the very
latest European drinking water standards,'' said John Burbidge, managing
director of Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd.
``This award follows the recent completion of a design and build contract for
water treatment works at Overton in Strathclyde, which was also carried out in
conjunction with PWT.'' The Overton contract involved a #l2.5m work project.
The construction of water treatment plant on the scale of what is now being
created at Broadside is a considerable project by any standards within the
industry.
To be known as the Carron Valley Water Treatment Works, it will represent the
largest investment in water services ever made by Central region. Work started
after a commemoration turf cutting ceremony in the summer.
``The plant will use the latest technology to play its part in delivering the
220 million litres of water used in Central region every day,'' said Andrew
Aitken, who is marketing manager for Henry Boot, Scotland. ``Completion of work
is due in spring l998, and the new plant will make the most of the vast water
resources available within the Carron Valley.''
It is a project which has been developed on an ``open book'' tender basis but
operated as a lump sum priced performance contract. A technical description is
that the new water treatment process will consist of chemical flocculation,
dissolved air flotation, rapid gravity filtration, disinfectant by chlorine
gas, and pH adjustment. Allowance has been made for future provision of
ozonation and carbon filtration.
Central Region Water Services say the plant will be fully automated to treat
l25 million litres of water each day. Hi-tech treatment methods will meet the
latest water standards, improving quality and reducing any likelihood of supply
failures to consumers.
It will be a treatment works which will have all the cleanliness and working
environment of a food factory. Enclosed process tanks will reduce the effects
of bad weather, while fully integrated controls with central monitoring will
carry out continuous standards checks. It will also have improved chemical
handling, dosing and washwater facilities, all vital in a modern, efficient
treatment works.
The water treatment plant buildings and operating areas are styled and
landscaped to blend into the surrounding countryside. Similarly, work areas
within the long, relatively low and unobtrusive buildings are bright and
spacious.
The location is to the east of Carron Valley Reservoir on the B8l8, a few miles
from Denny and Dunipace and the M80.

As the land brokers strive to negotiate a deal for Bosnia, Mladen Grbin argues
that any `peace' settlement will be hollow, and probably temporary
WHETHER one travels across Bosnia-Hercegovina by negotiating the tortuous local
roads, or by a quick flight in a UN helicopter, the massive devastation of the
towns and villages evident everywhere always impresses. The charred, roofless
remains of the homes of the Bosnian communities are a constant reminder of
three and a half years of war which has now ground to an uneasy halt.
In Tuzla, the well meaning and the curious descend on the people with views and
agendas which at times seem remote from the reality of life in war-torn Bosnia.
Writer and journalist David Rieff strongly attacked the UN in Bosnia; Michael
Ignatieff, after chairing a BBC-like late night show in the hotel bar which
delved into the higher levels of intellectual exercise, concluded that perhaps
we ought to do what we are best at...... some hard drinking.
American playwright Susan Sonntag concluded that Bosnia-Hercegovina is dead and
three or four segregated communities will rise into more or less independent
mini-states, fast becoming clients to the neighbouring states of Croatia and
Serbia proper.
Most outside observers, perhaps inevitably, adopt a tourist's view of the
recent history of the Bosnian people and a somewhat fatalistic resignation over
their future.
Fikreta Sijercic, president of the Independent Trade Unions in Tuzla, maintains
the future of her country lies in the recognition that the three constituent
peoples have no option but to continue living together.
She insists the paramount ingredient for peace is the reconstruction of her
country, whereby economic activity will divert the adversarial position of the
people, instead of concentrating their efforts towards a common goal, namely
individual and collective prosperity.
Fikreta is also in agreement with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the ex-UN Rapporteur for
Human Rights in former Yugoslavia, when he says the precondition for peace in
Bosnia and Hercegovina rests on these imperatives: that the perpetrators of war
crimes are brought to justice, that the people forcibly removed from their
homes have an unconditional right to return, and that the state of Bosnia and
Hercegovina must remain independent, sovereign, and united.
The clear message here is that the phoenix must rise out of the ashes, but not
without a massive injection of capital, and there is already, by some
estimates, a figure of $12bn being suggested for this purpose.
The latest US initiative, where the three heads of states are quarantined at
the airbase in Dayton, Ohio, is billed as the last chance to achieve a peace
settlement. And yet, are ``peace'' and ``peace settlement'' one and the same
thing?
The Americans want a quick fix, while the Europeans are in a quandary as to
whether they want it to succeed or fail. If the US initiative nominally
succeeds, it points to the failure of Europe. If it fails, the problem will end
up back in Europe's lap.
Croatian President Tudjman's concern, in the wake of the election, with a
somewhat lesser mandate than he had hoped from his electorate, is to support
the extension of Croatian interests by securing the position of the Bosnian
Croats, particularly those in Hercegovina.
This interest lies in the strategic importance of the security of the Croatian
borders. And for this, he is prepared to deal and agree with Milosevic on the
division of Bosnia and Hercegovina, at the same time supporting the Bosnian
Muslim/Croat Federation, in recompense for American support in brokering the
agreement between the two in March 1994.
The agenda of Serbian President Milosevic, the prime mover behind all the wars
in former Yugoslavia, is to minimise retribution from the international
community in the light of his role in the conflict.
To this end, he will demand the lifting of economic sanctions on Serbia, and
some formula which will pacify the Bosnian Serbs, in order to secure his own
constituency in Serbia in the name of the interests of all Serbs in the region.
He will, equally, be preparing to strike a deal with Tudjman, even if it means
relinquishing, for the time being, his claim on the territories occupied by the
Croatian Serbs and the Serb army in Eastern Slavonia. They will both argue for
the partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and will have direct input in agreeing its
future constitutional arrangements.
This fact, in itself, augurs ill for those who see their future in a united
Bosnian state. President Alija Izetbegovic in this sense is in the most
difficult position, not only because he is outnumbered in this scenario, but
because the future constitutional arrangement of Bosnia depends on the
agreement of the Croatian and Serbian delegations.
If Tudjman and Milosevic prevail, the vision of a multi-ethnic,
multi-religious, secular state of Bosnia-Hercegovina will be destroyed, and
replaced by a small Bosnian Muslim mini-state which, in turn, would very soon
become unviable through pressure from its neighbours.
The problem of achieving a sustainable peace for the people of
Bosnia-Hercegovina may, ironically, lie in the premature cessation of the war
activities which froze ill-gotten territorial gains through expulsion, murder,
the besieging of cities, and mass rape.
It will be difficult to resolve the issue, due to the lack of clear victory of
any of the sides in the conflict.
The terms of peace will be determined as much by the aggressor as by the victim.
Inevitably, the peace settlement will contain the potential for a continuation
of hostilities, whereby peace will mean merely a temporary suspension, under
the pressure of the international community for a quick fix.
A sustainable peace can only be achieved if the terms are dictated by the
winner. A just peace can only be achieved if its terms are dictated by the
victims of the aggression. Since the international community has decided to be
a mediator and not a defender of fundamental principles, the peace will be
hollow and temporary.

n HERE'S a good news story: under a covenant scheme a businessman is donating
#100 each year for the next seven years to The Herald Foundation for Women's
Health, writes ANN SHAW. Like many of the donors to the fund he does not wish
any personal publicity but is keen to support the foundation because of its
importance in improving the quality of women's lives.
Donating to the fund via a covenant could be the ideal way for the business
community to support the innovative clinic at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary and the
wider aims of the project. These are to raise the consciousness of every woman
about her state of health and reduce Scotland's shocking statistics for
illnesses which particularly afflict women's lives.
Such a covenant maximises tax benefits to the charity and to the individual
donor. For every #100 pledged by the donor only #75 is handed over while the
remaining #25 is recouped by the charity from Inland Revenue.
Those wishing to take out a covenant, which must be for a minimum of three
years, should contact the Herald Foundation for Women's Health in order to
obtain the necessary form.
Once funds are raised, the clinic devoted to gynaecological and related
problems, will operate under the NHS. It will also commemorate this year's
bicentenary of the Royal, internationally recognised as one of the most
distinguished teaching hospitals in Britain. It will aim to be a centre of
excellence, staffed by attentive personnel who will counsel and ease women's
apprehension about this particularly sensitive area of medicine, and provide an
informed investigation and treatment management.
For the convenience of working women, an early-evening clinic is being
considered.
The cost of setting up and running the clinic will be #100,000 and if each
woman reader of The Herald donated just #1, the total would easily exceed the
financial goal.
Please consider making a donation to the Foundation today, whether you are an
individual reader or a company representative. All contributions, no matter how
small, will be gratefully received.

George Collie, lawyer; born April 1, 1909, died November 9, 1995
LAWYER George Collie started and finished his legal career in the leading
Aberdeen law firm of James and George Collie, which was established by his
family in the mid-nineteenth century.
He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Aberdeen University before
serving his law apprenticeship, first in the family business and then at
Wilson, Caldwell and Tait, Writers, of Glasgow. He then worked as an assistant
to the Glasgow writers, Robertson, Chalmers and Auld, before returning to James
and George Collie in 1934. He remained there until his retirement in 1981. For
the past 20 years he was senior partner.
During the war he served with the 51st (Highland) Division RASC and was
severely wounded by a shell at St Valery en Caux in France in June 1940. In
August 1942, while still a patient in hospital in Paris, he escaped and
returned to Britain via the Pyrenees into Spain. That year he received a
military MBE for information he provided to the War Office and he also became
honorary colonel of the 51st (Highland) Division.
Mr Collie was a former chairman of the board of management of Aberdeen Special
Hospitals and an honorary sheriff of Grampian, Highlands and Islands at
Aberdeen and Stonehaven. He was also a former president of South Aberdeen
Conservative and Unionist Association for several years and chairman of
Aberdeen University Press. In 1964 he was made a CBE for his public and
political services.
``Geoff Collie was undoubtedly one of the most highly respected members of the
legal profession in Aberdeen,'' said Mr Alex Buchan, senior partner of James
and George Collie. ``He was a partner of the firm for 47 years and I was
privileged to be his partner for 15 of these years. He was a fine solicitor who
was immensely popular with his partners, staff, and clients and after retiring
in 1981 at the age of 73 he maintained an active interest in the business which
he had built up over many years.
``His other interests were diverse and included much charitable work. He will
be sadly missed by so many people in different walks of life.''
Mr Collie, of Morkeu, Cults, is survived by his wife Margery and their two
sons, George and James.

THE sentiment expressed in Kirsty Scott's article needs to be written into a
dirge of a new Scottish National Anthem (November 10). Then it should be played
at hundreds of megawatts at all national events till more of us are stirred out
of our timidity and apathy.
I live opposite the most prominent feature of this bonny town whereon stands a
large stone tower built by local merchants in the last century and then
dedicated to Lord Nelson. Throughout the summer the Union Flag flies proudly on
top each afternoon signifying that the tower is open to visitors. On November
30, as a special treat, the Saltire gets an airing.
Two months ago I decided that it was not unreasonable that the Saltire should
also get a regular airing. I wrote to the community council expressing that
view and, in what I felt was a spirit of good British compromise, suggested
that the Union Flag should continue to be flown on the anniversaries of Lord
Nelson's battles and on all significant British national anniversaries.
The community council discussed the issue and the local people were asked to
air their views on the matter. A total of 33 people responded, 27 agreed with
my proposal. The local area population is some 17,000.
Attitudes on the council are quite revealing. Three members supported the
suggestion believing the request to be reasonable. Of the remainder one thought
the request ``political'', one thought it ``sad'' because the Union Flag
represents all of Britain, and one feared the nationalistic aspect and reminded
colleagues of the large English population in the area who might be offended.
I now fear that we are probably the only unoccupied country in history
reluctant to fly its flag.
Kirsty Scott asks: ``Why is there no Scottish dream?'' Perhaps because we would
need to wake up to implement it.

Victoria Freedman explains how community repulsion and intolerance for facially
disfigured people adds to their emotional trauma
SUSAN DUNCAN always walks with her head held high. It is a determined, defiant
gesture, done to prove her rightful place in society. It is also very brave
because many people would rather not look at her at all. For Duncan, 32, from
Gourock, is facially disfigured, one of thousands who endure a daily dose of
cruelty, from comments to overt disgust, if they dare show themselves.
``There is plenty of evidence to suggest that people do not find it easy or
comfortable to interact with somebody who is different in that sort of way,''
says Halla Beloff, a social psychologist at Edinburgh University.
``It is clearly disappointing,'' says Beloff. ``It means that people who are
facially disfigured have to get past the negative experiences in terms of first
impressions, which do count, and then learn to be more socially skilled than
anybody else, just to make others less uncomfortable.''
Duncan is an expert, but she admits it requires enormous inner strength and
positive thinking. She has also had years of practice. A cancerous tumour in
her cheekbone was treated with radiotherapy when she was four months old, and
then removed when she was two, taking half her palate, top jaw and bones with
it.
As a result of the radiotherapy, she lost the sight in her left eye, hearing in
that ear and only reached a height of 4ft 6in. Since her late teens she has
had, on average, three plastic surgery operations a year.
``I've just had to accept that no matter how much surgery I have, I can never,
ever, be like other people. So I've had to say to myself, make the most of what
you have, build up your strengths. Yes, people will always judge by appearance,
even I do it, but if they take time to get to know you, they will see your
other qualities, such as your personality.'' She smiles: ``And a sense of
humour.''
That Duncan works to retain such a positive attitude and give her all in making
others feel more comfortable is quite remarkable considering her daily
experience. People stare, or even jump away in disgust. Some have commented
that she should not be allowed out. She also experiences insensitivity and
impatience from people who cannot understand her speech, discrimination from
employers - she is now at college studying multi-media computing - and a
general lack of imaginaton that she might have ambitions, feelings and
interests like anyone else.
She acknowledges that those who are disfigured later in life may find their
sudden transformation, physically and socially, too much to bear.
Valerie Lobban, from Edinburgh, who has been hit by attacks of facial paralysis
for the past six years, says she understands perfectly why many people wish to
hide themselves away.
``I was totally unprepared for the reaction of others. It's only that I've been
very determined not to let it get the better of me that I keep going,'' she
says. ``Compared with a lot of people, my problem is very minor.''
And even if those who are facially disfigured do manage to accept their new
face and regain their confidence, sometimes their friends or even loved ones
cannot cope.
Doreen Trust, from the Disfigurement Guidance Centre in Fife, a charity that
has funded several laser clinics in the UK to treat disfigurement, tells of a
nurse whose husband was in a car acccident.
``You'd think she'd be accustomed to suffering, deformity and misfortune, but
she found it increasingly hard to cope with the public reaction and would not
go outside with him. It put an enormous strain on the marriage.''
One couple she knows is suffering after the birth of a baby with a strawberry
birthmark; the mother refuses to take her baby out.
While Duncan does her utmost to make others feel comfortable, she believes it
is time we put in a little effort as well.
``Try to look us in the eye,'' she asks. ``I know that's difficult but there's
nothing worse than trying to talk to somebody who is looking everywhere. Most
of all I just want to be treated as a normal person.''
Certainly if the public reaction was more sympathetic, it would make the
private difficulties more bearable.
``I get up every morning and look in the mirror - I don't like this face,''
says Duncan. ``I don't like being facially disfigured. I want to be like
everyone else. It would be nice to be like my sister, who is lovely looking. I
would love to have a boyfriend, to get married. I'm fortunate that I realise I
can't change the past and have to get on with it, but there are times when I
cry buckets,'' she says.

THERE are some films which are truly terrible, yet offer wonderful
entertainment, and Alfonso Arau's A Walk in the Clouds is a vintage example.
The name Douglas Sirk springs to mind. He was the Hollywood director who used
to make lush dramas starring people who could not act, like Lana Turner,
filming them in lurid technicolour and coming up with the goods, a film which
kept audiences watching from beginning to end.
Arau's film is about a young GI, Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) who returns from
the war to find his bride of two days is not the girl he thought she was. He
has written to her every day, setting out his hopes and dreams, but she,
although she has kept the letters, has not read them. She insists he go back to
his old job selling chocolate and make a success of it, so off on the road he
goes.
On his travels he meets pretty Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who is
returning reluctantly to the family hacienda in the Napa Valley. She confesses
that while at college she became pregnant by a man who has not stood by her,
and Daddy (Giancarlo Gianni) will have her hide for garters - or words to that
effect. Being a gentleman, Paul suggests he impersonate her husband for a day,
thus pacifying Daddy, and then, to prove he is a rotter, abandoning her the
following morning. But, of course, it does not work out like that. Daddy hates
Paul, but the rest of the family, including the patriarch Don Pedro (Anthony
Quinn doing his Zorba the Mex act) think he is wonderful, especially after he
helps them save the grape harvest from a sudden frost.
One thing leads to another, the deception is revealed, and the grape harvest is
burnt in an accidental fire. It is about as slender a plot as could be devised,
which has been filmed by Arau in lurid technicolour - maybe the fact that Paul
is a chocolate salesman inspired him, because chocolate box top is the overall
impression one gets of the scenery - and with lots of cardboard sets.
As for the acting, Keanu is a male version of Lana, as animated as a
cigar-store Indian, but beautiful to look at, especially when he recycles one
of his vests from Speed, about all one should ask of a matinee idol; Quinn is
embarrassingly ethnic; Gianni emotes like crazy; and Sanchez-Gijon is even more
gorgeous than Keanu.
Arau made the enchanting Like Water for Chocolate, a book which should have
been unfilmable, and his Hollywood debut by the standards it set is a disaster.
On its own recognisances, however, it is hugely entertaining, and I would feel
the same about it if I had paid to see it, should you ask. They should have
called it The Grapes of Slush. I loved every ludicrous moment of it.
The same could not be said, however, about Tommy Boy, one of those brain-dead
comedies best viewed after several pints of lager and a curry which Hollywood
makes from time to time. Indeed Keanu has starred in a couple in his day.
This one introduces Chris Farley, who is fat, as Tommy Callaghan, dumb heir to
an auto parts company, and David Spade as Richard Hayden, his best friend and
the firm nerd. As a double act they have no charisma, no comic timing, and make
Abbot and Costello look like Laurel and Hardy.
When Big Tom Callaghan (Brian Dennehy) dies he leaves behind his new wife (Bo
Derek, who is now a 10 minus) and her alleged son, really her lover (Rob Lowe).
They are after Daddy's money, and a big-time auto parts company, headed by Dan
Aykroyd, is after the Callaghan firm. To save it from being taken over the two
dolts go on the road trying to drum up orders for Callaghan's new super brake
pads.
The slapstick is inept, the verbal humour crass, and the duo unlovable. But
there is one inspired sequence in which they run over an elk with their car,
pick up the corpse and put it in the back seat, except that it is not a corpse.
The animal revives and promptly destroys the vehicle. That was very funny.
Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine is a powerful story about a day in the lives of
three Parisian teenagers, a Jew, an Arab, and a coloured boy. The friendship is
questionable, because ethnic minorities tend to gang together, but it works in
the context of the film. They live in a slum suburb. There has been a riot, and
one of their friends is in hospital after being beaten up by the police.
They cross Paris to collect a debt from a friend who lives in a smart district,
fall foul of the police, two of them, the coloured boy and the Arab, are taken
for questioning and roughed up, the third runs off. They miss their last train
home, and the film follows their journey across Paris until as dawn breaks they
make it.
The film is a chilling indictment of police brutality, of what happens when
police treat people as suspicious when they are only going about their
business. The boys' problem is that one of them has a policeman's gun, which he
collected during the riot, and they cannot be found with it in their possession.
It all ends badly, as one would expect. What keeps it going is the furious pace
Kassovitz sets and the performances of the three boys, Vincent Cassel, Hunert
Kounde, and Said Taghmaqui. They fizz with energy, mostly misdirected, keep
getting on one another's nerves, throwing out furious challenges to anybody who
seems to have crossed them, and generally behaving in the most pig-headed
manner. If it were not for the police they would be their own worst enemies.
But they are not stupid, just rash and young.
Kassovitz offers no answers, and the story used at the end to set the moral
tone of the film about the man who has jumped off the roof of a skyscraper
muttering ``so far, so good'' as he passes each floor is old and obvious. But
even if he is not saying anything new he is saying it for his generation.
Roland Joffe's The Scarlet Letter, starring Demi Moore, Gary Oldman, and Robert
Duval, about the New England settler woman taken in adultery and forced to wear
the red-letter brand on her clothes, also opens this week, but Entertainment,
its distributors have not shown it to the press. They say they did not have a
print. Draw your own conclusions.

Q. My wife believes a man's waist measurement should be less than his hip
measurement. Is this right?A. Yes - there's some evidence that you're more
likely to live longer if the circumference of your waist is less than that of
your bottom. I'd advise all Man Alive readers to check these two figures with a
tape measure. If the waist reading is the bigger one, then for heaven's sake
start slimming!
Q. I have just been told that I have piles. Does this mean I've got to have an
operation?
A. No! About one in every five men suffers from piles at some stage in life.
Clearly, if all these guys had to be operated on, the National Health Service
would collapse . . .
Often known as ``haemorrhoids'', they are actually swollen veins, just inside
the bottom. In fact, they look very like the swollen, twisted veins which you
see on many people's legs. Nobody really knows what causes them, but surgeons
tend to blame lack of fibre in the diet, and ``straining'' while sitting on the
loo.
Fortunately, a lot of the time piles produce no symptoms at all. Usually, the
earliest sign that they're there is slight bleeding on the toilet paper. But,
as I've said in this column before, a man should never assume that rectal
bleeding is ``just due to piles''. Always have it checked out by a doctor.
Other possible symptoms include an odd sense of ``fullness'' in the rectum, and
also discomfort and discharge. And if piles get worse, they will often
``prolapse'' - which means come out through the anus.
OK, so what about treatment? Thank heavens, the majority of cases of piles can
be kept in check by very simple measures. These include using rectal creams or
ointments, prescribed by your GP. I strongly recommend anti-haemorrhoid
suppositories which can be exceedingly soothing!
Also, your doc will probably recommend taking action - for instance, by change
of diet - to ensure you don't get constipated. The idea of this is to prevent
you from straining while you're having a bowel action.
If these straightforward measures don't work, then usually the next thing is to
try injecting the haemorrhoids. Though this sounds alarming, it's actually
pretty painless. The surgeon just puts a needle into the anus, and injects some
special fluid which makes the piles ``shrink up''.
Only if haemorrhoids are really troublesome is an operation necessary. The most
common operation involves cutting the piles out. Another possible procedure is
to stretch the anus by putting two hands into it. I hasten to add that this is
done under general anaesthetic; results are generally good.
Q. My wife wants me to stop drinking beer and go on to short drinks instead.
She thinks that this would be better for me. Is that true?
A. Some people have this idea that if a drink is ``small'', it must somehow be
less harmful - or less fattening. But it just isn't true. Maybe your wife is
concerned that your alcohol intake is getting a bit too high? I suggest you
talk this over with her.
Q. Do you think it's OK to go into the office when one has a cold or 'flu?
A. I do not! You stand an excellent chance of giving the germ to the folk you
work with - or perhaps customers. A new survey suggests that Scotsmen are
particularly likely to ``struggle bravely on'' and go into work when they have
colds. My advice is: stay at home until you're better.
Q. You recently mentioned ``premature ejaculation'' in The Herald. I have
suffered from this for many years, and my wife wants to drag me along to a
Family Planning Clinic for counselling. But I cannot face that.
I have heard rumours that there is a drug which my own doctor could prescribe
for me. True?
A. Yes, recent medical research has shown that some men who reach orgasm far
too soon can be helped by judicious use of certain anti-depressant drugs - even
though they are not depressed.
Although it's still very early days, it does seem as though these drugs manage
to have some sort of ``dampening'' effect on the male nervous system - thus
making the chap less explosively triggered. The drugs which have given
promising results are: Anafranil, Seroxat, Lustral (a curiously appropriate
name in this context) - and the famous Prozac.
But I can't emphasise strongly enough that all these powerful medications
frequently have side-effects. So whether your GP will prescribe them for you is
not certain! However, for the sake of your marriage it's well worth going to
see him/her and talking it over. Good luck!
Q. I'm a pipe smoker, and I've had a wee sore place on my lip for several
weeks. Is this anything to bother about?
A. Will you please get down to your doctor's this morning if possible? To be
blunt, pipe smoking is a common cause of lip cancer. The classic way in which
this appears is a sore or raw place on the lip, which fails to clear up. I hope
this is just a benign lesion, but you must get it checked out now.
Q. I hope you don't mind a woman writing to your ``all male'' column, but I am
rather concerned about my husband. My worry is this. For some reason, he always
insists on going to a female doctor rather than a male one when he has to have
an examination. He avoids men doctors wherever possible.
Why is he like this? Do you think he ``fancies'' women in white coats or
something?
A. I doubt it, ma'am. A more likely explanation is this. A number of men aren't
very happy at having their intimate bits examined by another chap - because
deep down, they dislike the sexual implications of one male touching another
male's private parts. So, they pick a woman doc to do the examination.
There's nothing wrong with this; it's just like a sort of shyness, really! So I
reckon you should just respect your man's wishes and leave it at that.
n If you have a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at The
Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr D cannot reply in person, but
will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be published.

A FORGOTTEN fortress on Orkney is set to become Scotland's latest tourist
attraction.
The fort, built to keep out American warships in the early nineteenth century,
is to be restored and a single-track road widened to enable coach parties to
reach the site.
Next year, a cannon will be mounted atop the 45ft-high, stone-built Martello
tower, near Longhope, on Hoy. It was built after the Americans joined the
French in declaring war on Britain in 1812. In 1922, the Ministry of Defence
sold the site to London-born Mr William Cload, the artilleryman stationed at
the Longhope Battery.
Now, the Government has bought back the buildings from his 75-year-old
grandson, Mr John Cload, who will continue to live in the old officers'
quarters which has been the family's home.
Historic Scotland's island-based team of stonemasons plans to start renovation
work soon.

Port-au-Prince, Wednesday
A HAITIAN journalist was missing and a group of foreigners sought refuge in a
hospital from demonstrators today in northern Haiti, authorities said.
Evelyn Toussaint, a reporter for Radio VKB in Cap Haitien, was believed to be
in the hands of a hostile crowd after she and a colleague received threats for
citing the names of three people implicated in previous violence, journalists
said.
``It would appear that the crowd is unhappy with comments and statements that
they made,'' UN spokesman Eric Falt said.
``We have brought to the attention of our Pakistani peacekeepers the impact of
this issue on the freedom of the press.''
In nearby Limbe, 16 Americans, three Canadians, one Indian and one Austrian
took cover in a local hospital after demonstrators demanding better public
services set up roadblocks and conducted impromptu weapons searches.
The Haitian capital Port-au-Prince erupted into spontaneous street protests on
Saturday after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide delivered an angry speech at
the funeral of his cousin, slain lawmaker Jean-Hubert Feuille.-Reuter.

Nothing is easy! Pity then
The poet more than other men
THE opening lines of a poem, learnt in childhood, drifted in on me as I watched
Xpress Munich striving to conjure the hectic, random existence of Arthur
Rimbaud who blazed - like a comet wreaking havoc - through the respectable life
and esteemed career of Paul Verlaine.
But which poet to pity? Verlaine - who unhinged his settled routine and almost
lost everything because of his violent attachment to Rimbaud? Or Rimbaud - who
could never fall into step with anyone else, let alone moderate his ideas, his
behaviour, his intense sense of self, even to ease his own situation?
In truth it's hard to decide, since - in this new production - we never really
get close to the spirit of the men or their work.
Whereas their previous piece, Titanic, really did explore what - if any - were
the moral boundaries that existed within an artist's life and the creation of
his work, A Season in Hell seems to stick at sketching in the aura of uproar
that Rimbaud occasioned as a disreputable character, rather than as a radically
unsettling poet.
Unfortunately, the company weren't helped by the boomy acoustic of the space
which swallowed chunks of the text and thereby placed additional stresses on
the physical theatre, the design elements and the back projections - all of
which were nicely judged if taken as indicators of the brittle society that the
youthful iconoclast disrupted.
It's a pity that a more intimate space couldn't have been found within the
Assembly Rooms, because there are indicators that at closer quarters we could
have shared in some of the tensions and conflicts that the piece seeks to
generate.

Alf Young, Economics Editor, talks to industry minister George Kynoch about the
battle to win jobs by selling Scotland to the world
SCOTLAND'S attraction as a location for inward investment will be damaged if
the UK signs up for the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty, introduces a
minimum wage, and legislates for a tax-raising assembly north of the Border,
claims the Scottish industry minister George Kynoch.
But, in an extended interview with The Herald about the importance of inward
investment to the Scottish economy, the day the Scottish Office confirmed the
Chunghwa Picture Tube company of Taiwan is going ahead with a #260m investment
in Lanarkshire, Mr Kynoch denies that deep divisions in his own party over
Europe could have the same negative effect.
The minister also denies that his claim about the impact of Labour's minimum
wage proposals confirms that some inward investors already here operate
low-wage factories. He did, however, admit that some inward investment jobs
would be lost if the union target of #4.15 an hour for the minimum wage were
enforced.
Mr Kynoch also disputes the oft-heard complaint among indigenous companies that
the Scottish Office devotes too much of its limited industrial budget to luring
inward investors to Scotland. He claims indigenous companies have just as much
access to aid and support. Too many, he argues, are slow to grasp the supply
opportunities inward investment brings.
With the Chunghwa project safely in the bag, and the UK's largest-ever haul of
jobs from a single investment destined for Lanarkshire, Mr Kynoch could be
excused a smile or two of satisfaction. Eight months into the job, he had
played an important personal role encouraging the most senior Chunghwa
executives to favour Scotland.
It hadn't, he insists, been all about waving the biggest cheque book under
Taiwanese noses. ``That irritates me because I know it's not true. Very often
we're in a situation where we can't match what others outwith the UK are able
to offer.
``What we can do is sell the very positive attributes of Scotland,'' he went
on, citing a transport infrastructure now capable of next day delivery in
Europe, a skilled and flexible workforce and one of lowest corporate tax rates
in Europe.
``The financial package is important but it's not necessarily the deciding
factor.''
Scotland remains a competitive location in Europe, he argues, because we have
deliberately positioned ourselves as the ``electronics base for Europe'' and
are not ``shackled'' with the problems of the social chapter.
``Our opposition to a minimum wage is very clear. I think virtually everyone -
I suspect even Tony Blair - accepts that if he was to agree to a minimum wage
at the level the trade unions want of something like #4.15 an hour that it's
going to cost the UK something of the order of two million jobs. That's why
he's not willing to specify the rate.''
But did that, I wondered, also imply an admission that many of the jobs on
offer from inward investors are insecure and low paid, at rates well below that
putative minimum wage figure?
``I saw round Chungwha's factory in Taiwan. You can't possibly say these are
low-wage, low-tech jobs. This is a very hi-tech company. The bulk of our
electronics industry is hi-tech. In all businesses you get a spectrum of skills
from the highly skilled through the semi-skilled to the labouring jobs. I would
argue that by being successful in the electronics industry we tend to be
heading very firmly for a significant quantity of very hi-tech, high-skilled
jobs with high wages.''
But if that was true for every inward investment, why would Labour's minimum
wage pose a threat? ``OK there are always going to be some inward investments
in industrial sectors where wages are less than in others but the bulk of the
jobs that come are clearly solid employment prospects,'' the minister replied.
It was, Mr Kynoch added, ``very possible'' that some inward investment would be
scared away by a #4.15 minimum wage. ``But that is not necessarily saying that
all inward investment jobs are low paid. The social chapter, the minimum wage,
even a tax-raising parliament for Scotland, all of these must introduce
uncertainty and difficulty to business in ensuring it maintains its
competitiveness.''
And what about the perception that growing segments of his own backbenches now
favour withdrawal from membership of the European Union, the very market reason
American and Asian investors come here in the first place?
``I believe our party is very much more united than the opposition,'' he
insisted, calling in evidence the fact that eight Tory MPs voted against the
Government whip in the last significant vote on the subject, while 42 Labour
MPs defied their whip. ``Europe is a sensitive subject across all the parties.
But I don't think this ever enters into discussions with inward investors.''
With Lanarkshire missing out to North-east England on the Samsung and Siemens
investments in the past year, but now winning Chunghwa against South Wales, the
minister declined to be drawn on just how competitive Scotland is as a location
within the UK.
``I'm not sure we've actually got a breakdown,'' he said. Martin Togneri,
director of Locate in Scotland, who sat in on the interview, pointed out that
the Invest in Britain Bureau stopped publishing league tables some years ago
because they ``induced squabbles''. ``We feel we are certainly normally at the
front, or very close to the front, in UK terms,'' added Mr Togneri.
Despite that reluctance, it is, in fact, still possible to make some precise
comparisons. As our tables show, for most of the 1990s, Wales did significantly
better than Scotland in attracting international investment and the jobs that
come with it. It was only last year, thanks in part to two huge investments in
the semiconductor sector from NEC and Motorola, that Scotland got its nose in
front. Precise figures for the English regions are much less accessible.
That Welsh advantage over Scotland was, in part, due to South Wales's
locational attractions, lying as it does at the end of the M4 corridor, close
to the biggest UK markets and the main routes to Europe. Until now Scotland has
had to try to build strength in depth in particular sectors, like electronics,
where it has a long-established edge.
Mr Kynoch has an oft-repeated mantra which encompasses that edge - ``Scotland
produces 12% of Europe's semiconductors, over 35% of Europe's personal
computers, over 50% of Europe's automated banking machines and nearly 60% of
Europe's workstations''.
But is that focus on electronics - to the extent that the sector now dominates
Scottish manufacturing output and Scottish exports - also a potential weakness?
Just as we put too many eggs in the shipbuilding, coal and steel baskets in the
past, are we betting too much on silicon now?
``I take your point. But we are successful in other areas of inward investment
as well,'' Mr Kynoch replied, pointing to Selfcare International, an incomer
from Boston who announced in July it is creating 375 jobs to produce diagnostic
medical kits in Inverness.
The minister says he is anxious to broaden the base and sees encouraging more
indigenous companies to export as one way of doing it. ``That is where
government can help, ensuring the assistance we give is better targeted and
better co-ordinated so that small and medium-sized companies which, let's face
it, are the embryos of large companies, can get the guidance and assistance
they need in export markets much more easily.''
To those indigenous companies which complain that too much Scottish Office
emphasis and support goes to inward investors, Mr Kynoch is relatively blunt.
Most of the financial packages available to the likes of Chunghwa are available
to them too. He and his officials, he insists, go to considerable lengths to
ensure they do not bring in companies which might distort the local market.
``We are not allowed to put forward a package which would cause such a
dislocation,'' he adds. And Mr Kynoch has a challenge for local companies.
``Going round some of the inward investors, I find the comment being made quite
often that they can't source products and services here.''
That's a long-standing concern within Scottish Enterprise. The minister is not
depressed by the lack of progress. I tell him that 15 years ago, when Scotland
was awash with joiners' shops beginning to reel from the decline of traditional
industries, I talked to the Japanese boss of the first Mitsubishi television
plant in Haddington. He couldn't find anyone in Scotland to supply him with the
wood veneer cases in which television tubes were then housed.
Hadn't we, I asked, taken an awful long time to plug that and countless other
gaps in local sourcing for inward investors? ``I think it gives us a further
challenge to ensure we can fill that gap,'' came the unflappable Kynoch reply.
``We now produce 35% of Europe's computers. That's a hell of a lot of
computers. You've got to get a hell of a sourcing. It takes time. We're making
steady progress.''
When I asked if Scotland can keep up the pace, you can perhaps guess what he
said. ``It's a constant challenge.''

Rob Adams examines pianist Katia Labeque's divergence into jazz and how her
musical interpretations have added to the world-renowned twin-piano duets with
her sister
KATIA LABEQUE is trying to make up for lost time. In her late teens, while she
and her sister Marielle were learning a repertoire of contemporary classical
compositions and developing their extraordinary twin-piano partnership which
has bewitched audiences all around the world, Katia feels now that she was
missing out on studying another kind of music - jazz.
``I was 17 when I discovered jazz,'' she says. ``I listened to John Coltrane's
quartet with McCoy Tyner like crazy, but I never learned to improvise. Oh, I
can play around with a few chords but that doesn't mean I'm making music by
doing so.''
The voicings are doubtless more sophisticated these days but it was through her
playing around with a few chords and picking out melodies from the radio that
Katia's musical promise announced itself, at the age of three. She demanded
piano lessons from her mother (a piano teacher) and made such startling
progress that she gave her first concert at Paris's Theatre de Champs-Elyses,
aged seven. At this point her younger sister, Marielle, who had shown no
interest in music previously, demanded piano lessons also.
By the time Katia was 13, Labeque mre realised that she could teach Katia no
more, so the sisters enrolled at the Paris Conservatoire, graduating with
distinction three years later. At this point they made two decisions: to work
together and to play the works of contemporary composers. ``We had no choice,''
Katia explains. ``If we had arrived, two little girls, cute and charming,
offering to play Mozart and Schubert, no-one would have listened to us.''
People did listen to them. Olivier Messiaen invited them to record his Visions
de l'Amen and overnight they gained a reputation as contemporary music
specialists. Their list of subsequent collaborations is exhaustive but it was
with their recording in the early eighties of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue that
they really became established in a big way.
Ragtime and jazz pieces entered their repertoire shortly afterwards as Katia
began working with guitarist John McLaughlin's band. With her Conservatoire
training, she says, jazz came as a shock. ``The tutors wouldn't even admit that
Coltrane and Miles existed but I've come to believe less in schooling and more
in personality and imagination. School can teach you the basics but no-one can
teach you to be yourself.''
The experience of making her recent album, Little Girl Blue, on which she duets
with jazz piano masters including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock as well as her
sister, made Katia determined to develop her jazz playing. At the moment she
considers herself an interpreter. On tracks such as Bill Evans's Turn Out the
Stars, rather than creating a new solo of her own, she plays a transcription of
Evans's original solo.
``Sometimes people don't realise that jazz musicians, by creating something new
out of old tunes every time, are being really great composers,'' she says.
``For me, they are the equal of Ravel and Debussy and by playing transcriptions
of their great solos I hope to draw this to as many people's attention as
possible, although Chick Corea is very keen for me to improvise more when we
work together in the future.''
Little Girl Blue was, she says, a dream come true. Working with musicians who
have been her heroes for many years made her ``petrified and yet at the same
time so happy''.
``It was an amazing experience because for the first time I was my own producer
and in the classical world you're not used to that. So, whatever anyone thinks
of Little Girl Blue, I can't blame it on anyone else and from now on I will try
to extend production into classical music, to make them understand that we are
responsible, that we know what we want and can take decisions about the sound.''
For their concerts in Scotland this weekend Katia and Marielle will be joined
by the brilliant Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. They will play Mozart (Katia
thinks Wolfgang might be a jazz musician were he alive today), some Spanish
music, and some of Rubalcaba's originals, including - they hope - a piece for
six hands which he is currently writing.
Rubalcaba, who was a sensation on his Scottish debut in September, also
features on Little Girl Blue and recently joined Katia on a Brazilian tour.
``He mixes the three disciplines so well. He started as a classical pianist, he
inherited the Latin style from his father and grandfather, and he has really
studied jazz. Working with him in a duet is quite scary because he changes what
he plays every time and I never know what he's going to do. But sometimes I
recognise that he is playing the arrangement and I'm very happy.''
n Katia and Marielle Labeque play Aberdeen Music Hall, this Friday, Edinburgh
Queen's Hall, Saturday, and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Sunday.

CLEARLY Brian Wilson is destined to climb the ranks of the Labour Party as he
has at least one main attribute: never let facts stand in the way of truth. I
have never met or indeed spoken to him, but he appears from his media
appearances to be one of Labour's young brigade. Indeed, he may even have been
in short pants when last Labour were in power -1979, 16 years ago.
Does he never wonder why his party has been out of power for so long? Let me
remind him of the seventies. Almost daily strikes, spiralling taxation over
90%, inflation at an outrageous 20% plus, it may even have been referred to as
the period of rape and pillaging of the British people.
Indeed, pundits said at the time, ``we may never see Labour in power again this
century,'' and they may yet be proved right. Brian Wilson was perfectly correct
when he said Stephen Hendry loved Scotland and loves his country. He does.
While other birds have flown the coup, he has remained and will continue to do
so unless the events of the seventies return.
The Tartan Tax could, of course, be a reduction, not just an increase. Indeed,
our own Braveheart George Robertson suggests Jimmy White may come and live in
Scotland!
Brian Wilson and Mr Robertson should let us know what the cost of a Scottish
parliament is to be, bearing in mind they are suggesting an increase from 72
members currently in Westminster to 129 in Edinburgh, with all the additional
ancillary staff.
If we can have a profit-and-loss account and if the benefits to Scotland and
the people of Scotland outweigh the horrendous costs then maybe the three blues
will vote for Brian Wilson, but he should remember that before you can pot the
blues you have to pot three reds first of all.

Nairobi, Wednesday
THE husband and three other relatives of a British woman raped and hacked to
death in Kenya were in a Nairobi court today for the start of the trial of
three men accused of her horrific death.
Thirty-one-year-old Caron Winter's husband Adam later left the court and was
said by his brother, Harry, to be too upset to hear more of the gruesome
evidence.
Other relatives sat through the two-and-a-half hour session.
They heard how Londoner Mrs Winter was murdered at midday on July 31 last year
by what was believed to be a five-man gang wielding machetes, a hammer and
other weapons. Her 15-month-old daughter was just feet away in another room.
Mr Winter was beaten with a hammer and his nose was almost slashed off when he
arrived at their suburban Nairobi home during the attack.
He is expected to give evidence tomorrow after travelling from his new home on
the Caribbean island of Antigua for the trial.
The couple's neighbour in Nairobi, Phil Matthews, told the court: ``I found Mr
Winter with his baby in his arms. He was covered in blood.
``His nose had been cut from the top. There was a piece of his nose that was
hanging down.
``Caron Winter was lying on the floor. She was in a pool of blood,'' he added.
Security guards called to the scene identified goods stolen during the raid and
Mr Winter's brother Harry, from London, told how he had arrived in Kenya the
day after the killing to identify Caron's body.
``It was the worst experience of my life,'' he said outside the court.
With him were his mother, Ruth, and Caron Winter's brother Mr Adrian McDonald.
The Winters had been living in Kenya about a year before her death. She had
started a silk-screening business and Adam was a pilot who helped fly aid
missions for Rwandans after the genocide there.
Although prosecutor Horace Okumu told the court yesterday that Mrs Winter was
raped before she was killed, the three accused men are charged only with
murder.
Defendants Yusuf Rashid Wamasoro, James Washi-komba and Alexander Shikavale,
all Ugandans, have pleaded not guilty. All face death by hanging if convicted.
Today the hearing was halted when the judge announced that he does not sit in
the afternoons.-AP

THE war in Bosnia has been so savage, so bewildering (at least to an outsider),
and has had such extensive media coverage that any play runs the risk of being
overshadowed by the drama of real life. Mirad, a Boy from Bosnia, in this
production by the Oxford Stage Company, makes its point quietly by rejecting
histrionics in favour of a low-key, understated narrative style. From the
start, when the actors trudge on stage to address the audience directly in the
apologetic manner of refugees seeking asylum, the tale is told by a cast of
four in a dry, matter-of-fact manner.
In the first half of the play Mirad, a teenage Muslim boy forced to flee the
horrors of Serb invasion, is present only in the words of his diary and the
conversation of others. In part two, as the innocence of childhood gives way to
a maturity warped by experience, he appears in person (played by Gareth Corke),
quitting his safe haven with relatives in Holland to return home in the hope of
finding his lost mother. Of the two, the earlier part is the more satisfying,
perhaps because it was originally intended to stand alone as a complete work.
The play, which is aimed particularly at young audiences, has a powerful and
convincing intensity in this production by John Retallack, though in the end
the unflagging earnestness of it all is hard to take. Almost two years ago,
when the English version of the first part was introduced with a starry cast,
its raw topicality must have been shocking. But it still carries a potent
message.

I WAS very interested in an article by Alan Dunlop, ``A short-sighted vision of
the future'' (October 30). Returning recently from a three-city tour of
Australia, I was struck by how much the river and waterfronts contributed to
the vibrant life of each city in contrast to Glasgow's own riverside.
From Hobart, Tasmania, commuter ferries ply across the Derwent estuary to
Belerive, a popular commuter suburb. Traffic-flow across the main river bridge
is relieved at peak times by the ferries which revert to sight-seeing mode
during peak day-time tourist activity.
In Melbourne, the Southgate Centre has transformed a run-down area of dockland
on the Yarra river into a convivial area for the business community, complete
with restaurants, cafes, design shops, and a small aquarium. This centre now
provides a bridging point linking Swanston Street, the main axis of the central
business district across the Yarra, with the national gallery, concert hall,
and botantic gardens. From Southgate, riverboats follow the recently upgraded
foot and cycle paths which are alive with people taking exercise along its
green banks.
Anyone who has been to Sydney will be struck by the constant bustle of Circular
Quay, which was revamped for the 1988 bicentennial and is home of the museum of
contemporary art and the iconic opera house. The adjacent Darling Harbour, with
its renowned aquarium and massive tourist park, was derelict and inaccessible
to the public 10 years ago. Now it is alive day and and night; wardens and
infra-red cameras provide a sense of security after dark.
Commuting by ferry is a natural part of city life, and cheap and fast rail
links to the centre and suburbs ensure that river life is fully integrated into
the transport network.
These river scenarios could easily be Glasgow's, but does it have the vision to
find a use again for the natural asset of the Clyde on which it has turned its
back for so many years? Should we be seeing the river feature in the
city-centred millennium plan's transport strategy? It doesn't at present.
A coherent river development policy would greatly add to the proposals outlined
in the public realm strategy guideline document, concerned with the streets and
spaces in Glasgow city centre, which has already identified opportunities for
increased linkages along the river's edge. Instead of the ``severing effect''
of the Clyde, the river could have a much more cohesive role binding the north
and south of the city together.
Although each of the Australian cities is very different from Glasgow, there
are useful lessons. The increased peopling of the riverfront areas makes them
safer and imparts a shimmering vitality which draws people, together with their
spending power, to the water's edge. The natural highway of the river can also
relieve stress on the road system, and increase pedestrian journeys. That no
coherent plan exists for such a wonderful natural asset is unbelievable.
The city is working hard to reinvent itself, and surely the river should once
again be part of the new Glasgow. There are certainly many separate, and often
conflicting, proposals for developments along its length. These include the
proposed #90m leisure and business-use redevelopment at Pacific Quay to include
the Scottish National Science Centre; the Clyde Maritime Trust's proposed
maritime museum; and a #30m Sir Norman Foster designed extension to the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. Recent discussions of a direct rail
link to Glasgow Airport could be replaced in part by some sort of river ferry,
and the river could once again play an important role in the transport
infrastructure, while at the same time providing a recreational axis.
In May, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland's 1995 convention in
Glasgow took as its theme ``Cities on the Edge'' with one day devoted to the
theme ``The Water's Edge''. International and more local speakers showed case
studies of cities which had revitalised their waterfronts through inspired
design schemes.
The Laganside Development in Belfast by Robinson &amp; McIlwaine has already
produced two fine buildings, the Belfast Concert Hall and the Clarendon
Building. In Boston, participants in the Harbour Visions project were
challenged to dream up imaginative ideas for the harbour area ranging from the
immediate future to a century or more, but were also charged with the task of
grounding their visions in reality and proposing practical implementation
strategies. We have enough architects, designers, and artists in the city and
beyond capable of producing visionary, but practical ideas.
What is also required is something to bring all the separate discussions
together, and create a coherent and workable plan for the whole river. Charles
Scott, the convener of ``The Clyde Conference - The City and its River in the
21st Century'', to be held at Strathclyde University next June, states
emphatically: ``We don't want this to be a talking shop. We are keen to form a
unitary body and secure funding to develop the whole river and to stop the
present piecemeal development.''
The conference has already attracted, as one of its main speakers, David
Mackay, responsible for the redevelopment of Barcelona's shoreline, which used
to be cut off from the city centre but now forms a natural destination for a
major city axis.
Meanwhile Scott cites Tyne and Wear Development Corporation which secured #300m
of Government funding for its river-development programme, although funding
structures are somewhat different south of the Border.
As Simon Jenkins, one of the judges for 1999, put it: ``Here is a city that has
lost the reason for being where it is; the design and construction of ships.''
We need to find a new role and a coherent plan for the river which will help in
the regeneration of our city. Hopefully the Clyde conference will provide the
catalyst and all interested parties can have a say. There are enough excellent
case studies from around the country and further afield to inform and stimulate
the imagination, and enough hard evidence of the economic benefits of such
schemes to reassure the bankers.
As Gordon Murray of the Glasgow Institute of Architects reminds us, ``With the
demise of Strathclyde region and the instatement of the unitary authorities, a
unified plan will be essential.''

Art and has been a member of the UK City of Architecture and Design 1999

TWO corrections. First, the Diary buried Lord Fraser in Kilmarnock. He was
buried in Kilmaronock, near Gartocharn, on Loch Lomondside.
Secondly, in your report of a Remembrance Service at Westminster attended by
the Queen Mother, Mrs H Jones was said to have quoted Binyon's verse For the
Fallen, ``They shall not grow old''.
I cannot believe that a woman as sensitive as Mrs Jones would have been so
ill-informed as not to know Binyon's exquisite phrasing, ``They shall grow not
old''.
An ignorant reporter with a tin ear must have been the culprit for the Daily
Telegraph and the Times carried the same report. It is unforgivable that the
error should have been perpetuated in the public prints, especially at this
time of remembrance.

In principle
STEWART Lamont wrote of ``people whose lack of
religious belief makes them uncertain, fearful of death, and who cling to life
regardless of value'' (November 11).
Since he was talking about the principle of voluntary euthanasia, he seems to
be suggesting that religious people are more inclined to accept this principle
than non-believers.
He is wrong. Although many people have reservations about the practicalities of
legalising voluntary euthanasia, especially with regard to possible abuses,
most of those who are opposed as a matter of principle are religious people.

Jerusalem, Wednesday
AN Israeli court today remanded in custody for 11 days a woman Jewish settler.
Police have described her as ``dominant'' in the plot to kill Yitzhak Rabin.
Police told a Petah Tikva magistrates court that Margalit Harshefi, 20, like
confessed assassin Yigal Amir a law student at the religious Tel Aviv
university Bar Ilan, played a central role in the prime minister's murder and
plans to attack Arabs.
``She is one of the dominant members of an organisation that wanted to kill
Rabin. She was deeply connected to the murder of Rabin and to planning attacks
against Arabs,'' officer Tsion Tsafon told the court.
Harshefi, of Beit El settlement in the West Bank, was brought into court in
handcuffs. She wore a sweatshirt and long denim skirt and clutched a small
black prayer book.
When Judge Eliezer Cohen read the charges - conspiracy to commit a crime,
failure to prevent a felony, and involvement in an unnamed illegal organisation
- Harshefi gave a little laugh and said: ``I request a meeting with my lawyer.
I am not guilty.''
In addition to the remand, Cohen ordered that she not be allowed to see a
lawyer until Sunday.
Her lawyer, Denel Peli, and her father, Dov, both said she knew Amir, 25, well
but had no criminal connection with him.
Amir, a religious Jew, shot Rabin on November 4 as he left a Tel Aviv peace
rally. He said he killed Rabin to prevent the handing over of land, mostly in
the West Bank, to Palestinians.
Police today detained two Jews who spat on Rabin's grave in Jerusalem.
The two ultra-religious Jews admitted in a Jerusalem court they spat on the
grave but denied one of them had tried to urinate.
A magistrate's court remanded them in custody for six days while police
consider charging them with desecration.
Police freed Avishai Raviv, head of the extreme-right Jewish group Eyal,
arrested on November 6 on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Rabin. Raviv was
released on bail to remain under house arrest at his parents' home for seven
days and he may not enter the Israeli-occupied territories, a police spokesman
said.
Aside from Amir, Harshefi and Raviv, five people are being held in connection
with the assassination. All are religious Jews in their 20s.-Reuter.

John Burrowes claims that Glasgow may have transformed itself since its No Mean
City days but there is still a raw side which rivals anything from the thirties
THE predictable ones are being predictable again. They, together with sundry
good-news spin doctors, are set to pounce on a new book about the city of tree,
bird, bell and fish. Author Ron McKay's nascent novel titled Mean City is a
story based on the lives of those descended from the immortalised fictional
gangster Johnny Stark, his family, and contemporaries who featured in the most
successful book of all time about Glasgow - about modern Scotland? - No Mean
City.
In fact, the unaware McKay may have some other unforeseen problems about his
book, but more about that later.
The City of Culture that is destined in three years to be the City of
Architecture and Design bleats no louder than when the occasional writer
reflects on the raw and the real there is about Glasgow. They not only want to
shoot such messengers - they want them exterminated.
They screamed at their loudest, of course, when No Mean City itself was thrust
upon them in 1935. Instead of storming Westminster with such contemporary facts
as the city's housing standards being so horrific the infant death rate of 112
per thousand was almost twice that of Birmingham and London, including its
impoverished East End, they turned on the author of No Mean City, Alexander
McArthur, an unemployed baker who had turned to writing.
McArthur had an intimate knowledge of the Gorbals of the day, but was no
Hemingway. But to date his book has sales in excess of a million worldwide and
more than 3000 are still bought yearly. No mean feat was No Mean City.
The book's hero is portrayed as the city's greatest gang fighter, regularly
warring in gang battles with and against sometimes hundreds of participants.
Yet all my research for three books I've written on the thirties shows that No
Mean City was, in fact, a mild representation of those very primitive years.
``Sir, it is depressing nowadays to take up one's paper and read the daily
catalogue of assaults and murders with knives, razors and other lethal weapons.
Indeed, razor slashing and stabbing are becoming so common that they appear to
be accepted as part of modern youth's recreation.''
That was a letter published in the Evening Times on March 14, 1930, and
reflected the grim state of law and order of those very rough-and-tumble years.
Of course, Glasgow is nothing like those bad old days of the thirties.
Quick-response hi-tech cops armed to the ears with instant communications have
done as much for sword and cudgel gang fighters as throwaway shavers have done
for razor slashings.
And yet...... and yet! Take out the reference to razors in that 1930 Letter to
the Editor and it is still germane about our Glasgow of the 1990s. Those who
keep telling us how much they love the city - like the ones who will be
blasting McKay's book - will, of course, say otherwise. But it's those of us
who have the truest love of our city who want the warts to be shown and written
about in the hope that one day there really will be change.
Confront those who deny the truth that Glasgow is in so many ways a meaner city
than ever, and they're horrified. And that despite the graphic nightly details
uncovered so explicitly in the Evening Times Drugs Hotline where the streets
and the houses of the drug merchants were pinpointed.
Let those who defend our city through what they say is their ``love'' name a
public park where you can walk with impunity today. Who would even dare to set
foot after dark in the likes of Queen's Park, haunting ground for the strange,
hunting ground for the violent.
Rouken Glen, surrounded by a cluster of the city's most affluent suburbs, is
equally out of bounds. Two foreign visitors, unaware of its dangers, have in
recent times paid the penalty of innocence on evening strolls. Both were
viciously assaulted, sustaining the severest of injuries, one dying after
months of agony.
Who would let their wife or girlfriend walk through the city to meet them at
night? In Johnny Stark's day Glasgow was a mean place, all right, but not that
mean. The Razor King from the Gorbals fought his battles against other gangs
all over the South Side, Dennistoun, and the East End, but my granny and your
granny were safe in their houses. So were the kids who played in their
thousands in the streets. Aye, and in the dark as well.
Like the author of No Mean City, McKay will never be forgiven for this latest
book on the city. Glasgow put the boldest of stamps on its feelings four years
ago when it was suggested there should be a plaque, perhaps even a statue, in
memory of Alexander McArthur. The mere notion almost apoplexed city Labour
leader Pat Lally, whose snappy retort to the idea was: ``This man McArthur did
neither Glasgow nor the Gorbals any favour by writing his book and we will
certainly not be doing anything to remember him.''
They all run, don't they, when the raw side emerges? They were doing it again
before and after the airing last Sunday of Football, Faith and Flutes, the
Glasgow-produced Channel 4 programme on aspects of Rangers and Celtic fans.
It's as though they actually believe we don't have the kind of people any more
who populated what used to be known as the terraces at Ibrox and Parkhead. But
we do. Sadly, many aspects of that mean city are still out there.
Alas, as I mentioned earlier, there may be other problems in store for author
McKay. Twelve years ago I set out to write a similar book to Mean City. It had
the working title of No Mean City II and took all the characters from the
original on another generation.
Two lawyers in Scotland with whom I checked said there should be no copyright
problems but still wary, I sought expert copyright advice through the Authors
Society to learn that counsel's view was that such a book could be in danger of
what was termed ``passing off'', that is, a claim could be made against me for
causing confusion to the public by the publication of a book which might damage
the marketing potential of the earlier work.
I scrapped the 15,000 words I had written and started again, the result being
my book Jamesie's People, for which there are plans for yet another print.
Like so many things, the origin of the phrase that gave birth to Glasgow's most
eminent book can be traced back to the Bible. When Saint Paul was asked if he
was a certain Egyptian (Acts 21, verse 39), he replied he was a Jew from Tarsus
``a citizen of no mean city''. And prophetically he added: ``Suffer me to speak
unto the people.''
q.John Burrowes is a Glasgow journalist and author of the trilogy which began
with Jamesie's People, published by Mainstream and Fontana. Mean City is
published by Hodder and Stoughton.

PERHAPS it is time for a new compact between the royal family and its subjects.
The agreement, deal, call it what you will, used to be reasonably clear. The
royal family provided leadership, example, ceremonial treats, and a titular
position as head of the state in which we live. In return it was given loyal
support, respect, the duties due to headship of state, and affection bordering
on love. Some of the above was earned and much of it came with the job, but the
relationship has changed radically now and it is only fair to point out that
any changes which have occurred have done so entirely at the instigation of the
royal family. In the light of the public tussle between Prince Charles and
Princess Diana, which has alternately enthralled and depressed loyal subjects
for more than three years, it is clear that another and quite different
question to all those that have gone before must be asked. This is it: what
does the royal family want from us now?
The answer is not obvious. It would be sensible to make clear at this point
that the question should be addressed to Prince Charles and Princess Diana who
are, after all, presumed to be the future of the royal family in this country,
whether they are together or apart. They might reply that what they would
really like is something similar to that which was bestowed on the present
Queen and her predecessors; that is loyalty, respect, affection, love, and an
acknowledgement of a sense of the numinous which lifted them above the common
ruck and which was enjoyed by both royals and subjects. Then again, they might
not. Prince Charles has expressed his irritation with the traditional duties
and expectations which have constrained him, and Princess Diana does not have a
regal bone in her body. You see, it is they who have changed the compact, who
have come out of the palace and all-too-frequently into the gutter. It is they
who have removed the old certainties of both their position and ours, and
because of that it is they who are faced with the necessity of re-defining the
relationship.
It can probably never be put back as it was. Perhaps the most objectionable
aspect of the disagreement between Prince Charles and Princess Diana is the way
in which the public has been used as an unwilling arbiter in their argument.
Whoever or whatever is to blame for the breakup of their marriage is not in
question here. What is at issue is the tiresome way in which we have all been
dragooned into providing an audience for their tantrums. No, this is not
entirely the fault of the media. Both parties have persistently leaked their
version of affairs and have supplied information to authors of books which have
taken the position of one or the other. Prince Charles gave his infamous
television interview in which he bared far too much and Princess Diana
evidently intends to do something similar on Panorama next Monday.
Did we ask for this from our royals? No, we did not. It is fascinating, of
course, and to admit as much does no more than reveal us as humanly fallible in
our tastes. But looked at objectively, and with an interest in the status of
the monarchy, it is not edifying. There must be a better way of managing
things; indeed there is. It is the way of the many ordinary subjects who find
their marriages broken but who behave with dignity and sense and earn the
respect of their friends and family.

THE remembrance parades produced a brave show of medals from those who served
in the Second World War and later conflicts. But how many watching would have
much awareness about the origins of these? Most would be campaign or service
medals. Some, however, would be decorations for outstanding and gallant conduct.
The death of Jackie Mann reduces the number of living holders of one such
decoration - the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). This was awarded to
non-commissioned RAF aircrew. Among the holders are Battle of Britain pilots
and bomber crews whose life expectancy at one stage was measured in days and
weeks rather than months. Knowing this, I felt rather honoured recently to be
in correspondence with someone showing DFM after his name in the official
letterhead. However, it transpires that DFM in his case stands for diploma in
forensic medicine.
Sadly, this person is by age, profession, and status someone I would have
expected to have known better. He is also surrounded by people at least some of
whom should have had the awareness to put his gaffe right.
So much for knowing about and respecting the debt owed to those such as Jackie
Mann.
The DFM was awarded in the period from 1918. It was superseded in 1994 by the
Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), previously only awarded to officers. The
awards are by Royal Warrant and misuse of the letter indicating them could be
regarded as gross discourtesy to the Queen.
Let those issuing diplomas warn the recipients that Dip and never D should be
used in abbreviation to avoid similar gaffes.

AS a press spokesman I am well used to reporters being selective with quotes in
an effort to sell a story. A missing word here or there or a quote out of
context can turn a story on its head. In general, however, I have found The
Herald to be reasonably balanced in its reports, until now.
Reports on October 28 and November 13 referring to the Krakow II and 50 tonnes
of cannabis said to have been missed by Customs officers are incorrect. The
total amount of drugs found by Norwegian Customs was 20 tonnes.
The 21.7 and 27.7 tonnes referred to in your October report were, in fact, the
gross weight of the two containers This emphasises the danger in basing stories
on information sent anonymously.
The Customs team at Invergordon identified an irregularity in the paperwork of
two containers bound for Poland. There was insufficient time to search the ship
after the information had been fully analysed and the Norwegian Customs were
informed. They searched the containers and found 20 tonnes of cannabis. This
was a success for international co-operation in the fight against drugs.
The map in your November report highlights drug seizures over several years
around the Scottish coast. All the large seizures made were as a result of
international intelligence supported by brigading of Customs staff. This
supports the changes we are making to our organisation.
The international drug-smuggler is a well-organised professional who spends
considerable time and money setting up large operations for the illegal
importation of prohibited drugs.
The idea that a few lone Customs officers patrolling the remote Scottish
coastline will deter the commercial drug-smuggler is outdated.
We intend to combat that professionalism with greater professionalism - through
international co-operation, intelligence gathering, and the brigading of staff
so that when we do identify a problem we are there in numbers.
We have moved on some way from the booze-and-baccy seizures of the old days to
a much more risk-based targeted approach in our fight against the drug
smuggler. What we do need, however, is the support of the media, not this
misinformed attack on the work of Customs and Excise.
Change inevitably brings criticism from the uninformed but I wonder if Rabbie
Burns, a famous Exciseman, had the same media attention when his horse was
replaced by a bike.

The unchanging needs of society
THE editorial on Bishop Holloways's comments about morality and the Bible
deserves commendation (November 15)
Human nature has not changed since Old Testament times - only the outward
trappings of culture. (The Patriarchs' polygamy does not rule out the
advantages of trust in monogamy, which seems all the more necessary and for
many apparently difficult, in our western as opposed, say, to patriarchal Saudi
society.)
The Ten Commandments - regardless of whether they were in some sense, inspired,
as somehow they must surely have been for their day - represented a social
``back to basics'' programme. The prime needs of that society had to be met.
Even allowing for some social changes (eg, in the West the status of women and
servants), the commandments address the unchanging needs of any stable society
today - and even outside biblical Christianity they have many echoes. One
example only: Epictetus the Stoic has a passage censuring adultery. It is as
elevated in tone as  much in the New Testament.
Bishop Holloway does not seem to stress sufficiently that trust as a challenge
to adultery is a corollary to the fact that adultery is theft. Trust must
indeed be promoted if relationships (in monogamy or otherwise) are to survive;
and implicit in adultery is stealing. One cannot easily trust a thief.
Jesus transmuted the commandments into the call to love one another. That is as
necessary today as in his century - and Christian love is neither sentimental
nor promiscuous (despite human fallibility) but includes justice; and justice
does not countenance theft of any kind - or indeed any failure to conform to
the essentials for social stability.
This need not be said censoriously. Christian preaching should be an appeal to
look oneself in the face and ask whether one's guiding principle is a love that
is also just to others and ``takes up its cross''.
Something of this the Bishop appears to realise. But let us not play down the
need for self-discipline. Reason itself commends this.

PERFORMING ``unplugged'', or ``stripped'' as the Stones have it, is all very
well when there is some aesthetic behind it. I suppose. But when it is clearly
forced on a rocker by economic necessity it is desperately sad. Say hi to
Southside Johnny without the rhythm 'n' blues powerhouse that was the Asbury
Jukes - just guitar, acoustic bass guitar, and electric piano.
The man himself still looks the same - same prescription shades, same bad
haircut - and the voice is still superb. It is one that John's mentor Bruce
Springsteen would give his strumming arm for if he had any sense. But John
hasn't developed a style to match his pared-to-the-bone band and still sings as
if fronting a 12-piece din-machine. The only times that the event burst into
life was when the musicians gave up any pretence at doing something radical and
just settled in to be a good old-fashioned bar band, pumping out stuff like
Help Me. Even then they could still have done with a drummer.
No complaints about the material though. Fever segued into his own (well,
Bruce's) Got the Fever. Tom Waits contributed Heart of Saturday Night. Talk To
Me might have been one of the worst affected by the limited line-up (and an
initially lousy sound mix), but it is still a great song, with a cracking male
lyric, simple and affecting.
But in the end there is no appeal in hearing the demos of songs you first heard
in their full glory 15 years ago. Southside Johnny's take on the basics went
crashing between an entire IKEA store of stools.

Madrid, Wednesday.  SPANISH Foreign Minister Javier Solana tiptoed towards
Nato's top job today after weeks of public wrangling among the allies.
Mr Solana, whose name has emerged as a possible solution to the alliance's
search for a new chief, has been given signs of support so far from Germany and
Italy, as well as the US, the senior member in the 16-nation alliance.
``There is no reason at all for Spain not to be able to have the general
secretariat of the Atlantic alliance,'' Solana told reporters. ``But that
doesn't mean it will have it.''
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said earlier that Solana, 53, would make a
``magnificent'' secretary-general even though Spain was surprised by
suggestions he should run.
Gonzalez and Solana both said Spain had not considered fielding a candidate.
A foreign ministry spokesman said: ``For the time being there is no Spanish
candidate - for the time being.''
With the traditionally discreet process of picking a Nato chief now public
after weeks of rows between Washington and its European allies, Solana appeared
to be measuring his steps to avoid any risk of rejection.
Washington's European allies are still smarting at its blunt treatment of
former Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers, who was put forward by the Netherlands and
endorsed by key players only to be rejected by the US after holding talks there.
``I think everyone wants to make sure at this stage there are not going to be
any new fiascos,'' one official said. ``It's very likely that anyone who
doesn't want to take the risk now might be waiting to be reasonably sure of a
consensus.''
Mr Solana, a former Fulbright scholar in the US, is said to have good relations
with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and even with President Bill Clinton
- important personal assets in a race where personal chemistry matters.
His name emerged as a possible compromise candidate after the American
rejection of Mr Lubbers left only one other declared runner, former Danish
foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen today dismissed rumours that he was about to withdraw from
the race but diplomats doubted he could overcome apparent French hostility to
his candidacy.
At a ministerial meeting in Madrid of the Western European Union defence group
yesterday, several fellow European foreign ministers openly praised Mr Solana
and said he would make a good replacement for Belgium's Willy Claes, who quit
on October 20, facing an investigation into a Belgian arms procurement scandal.
Diplomats said for a real consensus to start emerging, Solana would probably
have to declare his ambition.
Potential backers could be reluctant to throw their weight behind someone who
may then not run - a point underscored today by the US envoy to Nato, Robert
Hunter.-Reuter.

In July 1994, Strathclyde also published two other relevant documents,

WE ARE acquainted now with the contents of what will be the last full programme
of Government legislation before the next election. It has leaked out in dribs
and drabs of course, to such an extent that there are few surprises; indeed we
have already had the opportunity to comment on much of it. Although the Queen's
Speech has been planned together with the Budget as an effective two-headed
assault on Labour's current popularity, it is clear that the bulk of
responsibility for this task will rest with the Budget. The problems
encountered by Tory drafters of the Queen's Speech are obvious. A programme of
reasonable legislation must be brought forward with decent expectations of
success, but with a majority of just six in the Commons it was clearly
impossible to present active and controversial legislation. If the result is
dull in terms of both parliamentary drama and in the effect which controversial
legislation might have on already battered sectors like education and health,
then we should delight in the tedium. In Scotland in particular we have little
beyond the humdrum and again we should be grateful. Yet this is a busy enough
programme containing 15 Bills, which is two more than last year.
In his response in the Commons yesterday Mr Tony Blair delivered his customary
vigorous performance, spurred on it seemed by the gloomy faces on the
Government benches. The core of his attack rested on the allegation that the
proposed legislative programme had more to do with the political fortunes of
the Tory party than with governing the nation. This was an easy jibe if an
accurate one, although nobody needs suspect that Mr Blair would do anything
different if he were to find himself one day in Mr Major's predicament. In
attempting to emphasise the difference between Tory and Labour policies or, in
more realistic language, trying to grub for some votes, the Tories have decided
to concentrate on the unlikely figure of Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary.
It is difficult to think of a more vilified occupant of that office or one who
has had so many rebuffs from his legal peers and suffered so many legal
reverses of decisions. Nevertheless, Mr Howard is the bobbing cork of the
Cabinet; his pursed and shadowed smile never fades and with his policies to
streamline the handling of asylum applications and to fine employers who
unwittingly employ illegal immigrants he hopes to gather popular support. We
hope he is wrong. The so-called light regulatory touch does not remove the
absurdity of turning employers into immigration officers, and the list of
countries to which the Government believes it will be safe speedily to return
asylum-seekers includes Nigeria.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, believes he can
discern a golden thread running through the programme presented yesterday. It
is a curious metaphor, for while gold has an attractive glint, thread is easily
snapped. Mr Forsyth plans to make sensible use of the existing legal framework
to apply further controls to the running of raves at which youngsters can be at
danger from drug pushers. His support for the nursery voucher scheme is
unlikely to enhance its attractions and the easing of the problems caused by
school placing requests will help the sufferings of Balfron High School in his
own constituency but will be of little use to popular secondary schools in
urban settings. For real information on the Government's intentions in coming
months we will have to wait for the Budget. In comparison with the Queen's
Speech it may even be a relief.

The Traverse Theatre has been honoured for its creativity, as CAROLE WODDIS
explains
THEATRE may be said to be dying - and certainly final rites are constantly
invoked - yet it shows no signs of actually kicking the bucket. On the
contrary, according to London-based American critic and producer Blanche
Marvin, despite financial stringencies and more glossy co-productions, ``the
avant garde work just keeps on growing''.
Edinburgh Traverse's Ian Brown is less sanguine. ``People are spending less on
going out. Our audiences are being split. Something's got to give. That's why
recognition like this is so important to us.''
Brown was speaking in London yesterday after receiving a special achievement
award on behalf of the Traverse and its thirtysomething years of creating
theatre in small spaces - part of the annual Empty Space, Peter Brook Awards
initiated by Marvin in celebration of the ideals of the international, Paris
based-director and his life-time devotion to the new and experimental. Now in
its fifth year and held annually in conjunction with Covent Garden's Theatre
Museum, this year's major award went to the Royal Court Upstairs for a stream
of controversial and eclectic new plays - double its usual work rate as James
Macdonald, one of its young directors pointed out ``but entirely to do with the
response to writers from a new generation coming through who amazingly still
choose to work in the theatre instead of other art-forms that might be more
seductive''.
Paying tribute to writers, Brown feels Scottish writing may also be on the
brink of a new era. ``It's not exactly been a golden age in recent years but
now I think we're into a new phase. It's very encouraging the number of new
writers coming out of Scotland.''
But, he pointed out that new writing remains a high-risk activity. Which is why
accolades such as the Empty Space awards are so important.
``Some people don't appreciate us as much as they should. It's too easy to
underestimate and marginalise what we do. But we're part of a national system,
a link in the chain of new writing and all the attendant costs that involves.
It's a major achievement we are open and solvent, for the challenging kind of
work we produce, year-round.''
He hopes Edinburgh District Council are listening. For, he believes, a change
of policy and financial recognition of the cost of producing new work is long
overdue. Without it, the Traverse's future looks less than promising.

THE article on Trident refit work rightly focused on the betrayal of the
workforce at Rosyth Royal Dockyard by the Government and the particular
treachery of Malcolm Rifkind (the Defence Secretary at the time) in not
supporting both the taxpayer and the Rosyth workers (November 10).
As Mr Jack Dromey proclaimed, the Government was happy to accept the Devonport
Dock's bid for the contract of refitting Trident submarines despite the fact
that it was an unrealistic quotation and the taxpayer would have to pick up the
cost of the necessary upgrading work.
The real reason for the contract being awarded to the south coast of England is
that there are few or no votes (and parliamentary seats) to be gained or lost
by assisting Fife, but John Major was very alert to the fact that, had the
Trident work come to Scotland and not the south coast, a number of his
sycophant MPs would have lost their seats in the next General Election (which
will happen in any event).

AS A FORMER parish minister of Unst I was amused by your report of that most
northerly island of Shetland as being tiny, barren, and remote (November 14).
Tiny? It is the same size as Jersey in the Channel Islands. Barren? Though
virtually treeless and with plenty of rock and moor it has magnificent cliff
scenery, glorious beaches, lovely lochs, an undulating hilly landscape, and
some passable farms and crofts.
Remote? Well, as the old lady in Lewis said: ``Remote from where?''
Curiously the name may derive from an old Norse word meaning ``nearest''.
However, I suppose that as there is only one absolute everything is relative.
As a former secretary of the island development group and an initiator of the
island's airstrip I would find it sad to see that lifeline close. But a high
security prison on a civilised parish where you could leave your ignition keys
in your car, where doors were rarely locked? I am doubtful - albeit years ago I
did suggest the small uninhabited island of Uyea to the south as a possibility.
Difficulties of recruiting staff, the cost of transporting prisoners and
visitors would, I reckon, make it prohibitive as an Alcatraz unless it was a
smallish enterprise.
Moreover, one wonders if the ``hard'' men would be tough enough to withstand
the occasional gale - Unst has the UK's highest, albeit unofficial, windspeed
of 177.2mph.
While ``Unst'' might possibly also derive from an ``ern'' (the sea eagle)
therefore ``eagle isle'', it has to be remembered that Scotland had an Alcatraz
for centuries - it was ``the Bass,'' much nearer supposed ``civilisation''.

THIS eye-witness account of life in Germany after reunification was first
performed as a rehearsed reading upstairs at the Royal Court and almost without
precedent transferred downstairs immediately for a short season.
A collection of real-life testimonies by Klaus Pohl, one of Germany's most
performed dramatists, its power resides less in the conventional meaning of the
word drama than in what it reveals - a country still deeply at odds with
itself, a kaleidoscope of events that flatters neither side, neither Western
capitalism nor the former communist regime.
In a large, grey, impersonal hall that shrieks a state of transit, be it
immigration, passport or railway waiting room, director Mary Peate's five
multi-purpose actors deliver their testimonies straight to the audience.
And what a riveting, sad story they tell - of individuals at the mercy of
political systems, pushed hither and thither like pawns both before the Wall
came down and since as a trail of human wreckage piles up in the wake of a
planned economy forced overnight to become a market one.
A West German insurance exec smugly criticises the non-commercial attitude of
his East German counterparts; a former East German worker describes the
emergence of ``cowboy'' salesman preying on gullible workers in comparison with
the lack of consumerist pressure under the old regime. A woman psychiatrist
meanwhile inveighs loudly and bitterly against the straitjacket mentality of
her former East German homeland, but an ex-East German mayor, spelling out the
food shortages of the old system, also laments the loss of a shared sense of
community.
Rueful and salutary, brutality in its many guises seeps out from the stage of
the Royal Court. In the hands of its cast, and particularly Freda Dowie and
Robin Soans, it takes on the unarguable force of truth.

CLAIMS that dangerous hospital waste was dumped at a tip in Dundee have been
condemned by the district council.
However, the makers of last night's BBC Here and Now programme were standing by
their claims amid accusations that they had ``misled'' Dundee District Council
over film footage of bloodstained swabs and test tubes allegedly taken at the
Riverside rubbish dump.
The row broke out after the programme makers investigated the city's Baldovie
incinerator which destroys 18,000 tonnes of waste a year from hospitals across
Scotland.
The television team claims to have filmed footage of confidential patient
records, test tubes containing blood, and other dangerous waste at the
Riverside landfill site.
A spokesman for Dundee District Council accused the BBC of having ``nothing''
to support its claims.
The spokesman also disputed claims that the film crew had seen clinical waste
on the Riverside tip.
``The film crew did not visit the site until the day of the interview. The BBC
has told us that what they saw was contained in a video made by a third party
unknown to the council.''
The spokesman also claimed ``not one member of the crew saw any evidence of
unburnt material when they visited the Dundee tip''.
However, BBC spokesman Jon Steel said: ``We firmly stand by our story. We have
film of syringes and surgical gloves on this dump. That is our footage, which
we took. There is also other video evidence taken by a local campaigner.''
The programme also claimed that the incinerator is producing ``a cocktail of
dangerous substances''. The council spokesman said: ``If Her Majesty's
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate thought there was a problem the plant would
not be allowed to operate.''

GERRY Adams is calling on the white House again today, in an effort to enlist
President Clinton's support for his position in the negotiations with Britain.
He has accused the British government of dragging its feet and setting
impossible conditions before the all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland can begin.
Mr Adams has been to Washington several times since Mr Clinton allowed him into
the country for the first time early last year.
This time, he will meet the president's national security adviser, Anthony
Lake, and Mr Lake's chief assistant on Irish questions, Nancy Sonderberg. He
will not meet the president.
Leaders of the Unionist cause in Northern Ireland visited Washington last month
on the same errand. The president is due to visit Britain and Ireland at the
end of the month, and ``celebrate the extended period of peace and the end of
violence, and illustrate that the people of Belfast can now move freely and
that life has returned to normal,'' according to a White House official.
Mr Adams wants to persuade the president to use his considerable influence in
London and Dublin to get the British Government to give up its demand that the
IRA accept at least the principle of partial disarmament before the talks can
begin.
The partial shut-down of the US government has upset Mr Clinton's travel plans
this week: he has cut short a visit to Japan for a Pacific Rim economic summit
in Osaka. He will now leave Washington late on Friday and return on Monday,
spending the bare minimum at the conference.
It is too early to say whether the continuing political crisis in Washington
may affect his visit to Britain, but it is at least possible that he may cancel
it altogether.

THE Queen's Speech contains a raft of measures which the Tories hope will give
them a clear advantage over the Opposition on law and order.
The most controversial is likely to be the new Asylum and Immigration Bill
which, according to the Speech, will ``streamline further the handling of
asylum applications and strengthen enforcement of immigration controls.''
The Speech contained no detailed explanation of the plans and how they would
work, but the measures envisaged by Home Secretary Michael Howard have been
widely trailed in recent months.
A key proposal designed to accelerate and reduce the cost of processing asylum
claims is the creation of a so-called ``white list'' of countries deemed to be
safe. Asylum applications from residents of those countries will be presumed to
be unfounded.
The other key part of the Bill is likely to be an attempt to deal with illegal
immigrants.
Earlier this year, Mr Howard floated the idea of heavy fines for employers who
gave jobs to illegal immigrants. However, the proposal prompted deep misgivings
within the Department for Education and Employment - which feared it could
result in companies being less ready to recruit ethnic minority staff - and
among employers' bodies and civil rights groups.
It is now expected the Bill will require employers to check the records of
potential recruits, in an effort to stop illegal immigrants working, backed up
by a ``light, regulatory approach.''
Narendra Makanji, chairman of the Anti-Racist Alliance, said unions and
immigrant welfare groups would unite to defeat the Bill.
``This Bill is undoubtedly a curtain-raiser for a Tory racist campaign in the
run-up to the next election.
Claude Moraes, director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants,
said that the move to hold employers responsible for taking on illegal
immigrants would deeply damage race relations and would alllow unscrupulous
employers to discriminate against black British citizens.

The Scots, two married couples from Prestwick, Ayrshire, were among a group of
72 visitors who set off for Nepal 12 days ago. Sandra and Cameron White hope to
raise money for breast cancer research. They were with friends Peter and Tracy
Croudace.
Nothing has been heard of the group, who were part of a 17-day charter tour and
were accompanied by more than 30 Sherpa guides.
However, a close friend of the Prestwick couples said last night that their
families were confident they had escaped the tragedy. ``We don't think they
would have been far enough in yet. It was a 17-day trek but I think it would be
almost a month altogether, to allow them a few days at base camp to acclimatize.
``Communication is non-existent once they get on with their trek, which could
be why nobody has heard anything yet, so no news is good news.''
She added: ``Tracy wasn't going to phone her mum until the end of November.
That's when they're back in Katmandu. It's not like going off to Benidorm. We
wouldn't expect them to be in touch if they can't get near a phone. They
probably don't know the avalanche existed.''
Mr and Mrs Croudace, who live in Main Street, Prestwick, are believed to be in
their late twenties. They both work for the Civil Aviation Authority in air
traffic control at Atlantic House, Prestwick.
Mrs White, 40, is a breast care specialist nurse at Ayr Hospital. Her
44-year-old husband is also an air traffic controller at Prestwick. They live
at Caerlaverock Avenue, Prestwick and have two sons Stephen, 24, and Jason, 20,
who has already visited the Himalayas on a church fellowship.

<HEADLINE>Strict curbs aim to make raves safer</HEADLINE>

A BILL aimed at making raves safer for young people will impose new licensing
conditions and will seek to control the size of licensing boards under the new
local authority structure.
The Scottish Drugs Forum has been asked to prepare advice for organisers,
setting out the practical steps which can be taken, such as providing
``chill-out areas,'' free drinking water and appropriate stewarding.
Under the Scottish Office proposals, licensing boards would be given the power
to attach specific conditions to licences for premises used for raves to
enhance the safety requirements covering the events.
A key feature will be to target potential and actual drug misuse, and
supporting guidelines will be issued to licensing boards to aid their decision
making.
Each of the new councils coming into being in April, 1996, will be required to
decide whether to elect one licensing board for their area or whether to divide
the area into licensing divisions, each with its own licensing board.
Either way, the Bill will contain measures to ensure that, after local
government reorganisation, representation on licensing boards is kept at a
workable level.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said: ``The dangers of recreational
drug-taking have been highlighted yet again in recent days with the reports of
the collapse of an 18-year-old girl after taking an ecstasy tablet.
``In Scotland last year, we saw the tragic deaths of three young men in
Ayrshire after attending a rave at Hanger 13. All of us - parents, teachers and
indeed young people themselves, have a responsibility to spell out the dangers
of drug taking. The Government will continue to help this education process and
at the same time hammer the dealers in this evil trade.''
Mr Forsyth said that raves and the club scene had been linked to the taking of
recreational drugs, which was why he had decided to take action to make sure
that the organisers of raves, and the young people who attended them, knew how
the risks could be reduced.
He added: ``I intend through the Licensing (Scotland) (Amendment) Bill to give
licensing boards the power they need to require that there are proper
safeguards and control over raves held in licensed premises. If the organisers
of these events cannot or will not comply with the conditions set down they
will not be able to operate.
``I do not want to deprive young people of a source of entertainment, but I do
want to ensure they can enjoy themselves safely.''
Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said: ``What is
required is proper licensing of rave clubs and outdoor venues where raves
occur. Model conditions for rave license should deal with attendance levels,
stewarding and searching of people entering the rave venues.
``I welcome this measure, but on its own it cannot deal adequately with the
problem and should only be seen as the first step.''
THE Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday that he is to ask the European
Union to help Caribbean states stem the flow of drugs from South America.
``In an evil trade like this, no drug is soft, and no drug is safe,'' he said.
Disclosing his new initiative, Mr Major told MPs many of the drugs from South
America were smuggled to northern Europe through the Caribbean.
``Over the last few weeks, I have been consulting Caribbean leaders about the
ways of breaking this chain,'' he said.
``At their request, with their agreement, I will be asking the EU to give them
effective help.
``The intention would be to find the resources to stop the Caribbean being used
as a way-station for drugs from Latin America en route to northern Europe.''
Mr Major said he believed the country must use every resource against the drugs
threat.Hence the Queen's Speech proposed to lift the existing barrier to the
Security Service helping the police and other agencies against organised crime.

Ferry hero plans
to adopt Thai boy
BANGKOK: A British man who rescued a toddler from a sinking ferry now wants to
adopt the boy, it was reported yesterday. Mr Arthur Hughes was a passenger
aboard a ferry going to the island of Koh Samui, 270 miles south of Bangkok,
when it capsized and sank last Friday.
Mr Hughes, a tourist, was reported to have given his life jacket to
three-year-old Thai boy, Jessada Laohbhram, and helped him escape from the
lower deck as the boat went down.
Tourism prize
BRUSSELS: Regional parks in Britain and France, an Austrian region and an Irish
town are nominees to win the European Prize for Tourism and the Environment,
the European Commission said yesterday. The French Cevennes National Park, the
medieval Irish town of Kinsale, the Austrian region of Weissensee and the
British Peak District National park are all finalists.
Cambodia deaths
ARANYAPRATHET: Two Khmer Rouge guerrillas and one Cambodian government soldier
were killed and many others wounded yesterday after several hours of the
heaviest fighting for the past few months, officials said.
Growth areas
OSAKA: Asia-Pacific ministers edged closer yesterday towards agreement on how
far and how fast to open up the world's fastest-growing economies, and a new
report spelt out the potentially huge rewards of a deal. A report forecast the
18 member economies could grow by a massive 20% by the end of the century, the
highest regional rate in the world, if infrastructure and energy shortcomings
were overcome.
EU film fund
BRUSSELS: The European Commission proposed yesterday that the European Union
set up a guarantee fund that could generate more than one billion dollars to
help its struggling filmmakers compete against Hollywood.
Boy killed
NAPLES: A two-year-old boy was shot dead yesterday in a war between organised
crime groups in southern Italy. The boy and the man whose car he was travelling
in were killed near Naples, when a gunman in a second vehicle pulled up
alongside and opened fire, police said.
Former Nazi
BUENOS AIRES: The Supreme Court in Buenos Aires has rejected a final appeal by
a former Nazi officer accused of the 1944 massacre of 335 men and boys outside
Rome, clearing the way for Erich Priebke's extradition to Italy.
Vodka fatalities
MOSCOW: The Russian government must act to stop men drinking themselves to
death, scientists attending an international conference on alcoholism said
yesterday. Experts at the conference in Moscow told Tass news agency that the
average Russian man drinks half a bottle of vodka a day.
De Gaulle statue
PARIS: A copy of a London statue of the late French president Charles de Gaulle
will be inaugurated at the Invalides war museum in Paris on November 22, the
Defence Ministry said yesterday. The original statue was erected two years ago
at London's Carlton Gardens, the wartime headquarters where General de Gaulle
led resistance in Nazi-occupied France.

A CALL for divorce laws in Scotland to be reformed was made yesterday by a
Scottish group which helps separated families maintain contact.
The director of Family Mediation Scotland Ms Susan Matheson welcomed the
announcement of proposals in the Queen's Speech to review divorce in England
and Wales
She said the reform was ``long overdue,'' and the group would be seeking
similar moves north of the Border.
``Contrary to the opinion of some, this reform will not encourage divorce - the
divorce law has little bearing on the difficult decision to separate.
`` These reforms offer parents time to consider the consequences of their
actions and make the best possible plans for their childen,'' she said.
Ms Matheson said proposals in England and Wales to abolish the fault grounds
and increase the role of mediation were particularly welcome.
She added:``As the aim of FMS is to meet the needs of children of separating
and divorced parents, we are watching with interest the divorce law reform
proposals for England and Wales.
``We would welcome reform in Scotland along similar lines for the benefit of
very many thousands of Scottish children each year,'' she added.q.The Prime
Minister could face Tory right-wing wrath by pushing ahead with divorce law
reform in England and Wales.
The Bill faces a difficult passage and there could be concerted attempts at
amendment.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, is said to be prepared to undertake serious
amendments.

<HEADLINE>Clinton and Congress dig in citing  `irreconcilable differences' Presidency staked on budget resolution</HEADLINE>

CONGRESSIONAL Republicans offered a plan today to reopen business for the US
government, but President Bill Clinton vowed to veto it and said he was ready
to stake his presidency on the budget fight.
``If the American people want the budget that they (Republicans) have proposed
to be the law of the land, they're entitled to another president, and that's
the only way they're going to get it,'' he said in a television interview.
Fearing the government shutdown could drag on for days, Clinton cancelled a
weekend trade trip to Japan and put Vice President Al Gore in his place.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, seen by many
Americans as the bad guys in the budget fight, proposed a temporary spending
bill dropping an increase in premiums for Medicare insurance for the elderly
that had troubled Clinton.
But the measure would commit the Democratic president to achieving a balanced
budget in seven years using Republican estimates of future economic growth that
the White House said would force deep cuts in popular social programmes.
Clinton prefers a gentler path of nine or 10 years to a balanced budget.
The White House specifically rejected this plan and Clinton struck a defiant
stance against Republican budget priorities in general when told that Gingrich
had warned the impasse could drag on for 90 days.
``I'm not going to do it, even if it's 90 days, 120 days or 180 days,'' he told
CBS News. ``If we take it right into the next election, let the American people
decide.''
Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, told Dole he expected the House to pass the
measure and send it to the Senate. He said it would fund the government until
December 5 and give both sides time to work on a permanent budget solution for
1996.
The speaker said of Clinton: ``If he wants to sign the stopgap spending measure
that will reopen the government, then he is signing a contract that says seven
years to a balanced budget.''
But the White House, aglow at polls showing that Americans for the most part
agree with Clinton's position, was adamant.
``There has been no dramatic shift at all as a result of what the Republican
leaders said. This is the same formula for impasse that we've been living with
for the past 48 hours,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
There was every indication that 800,000 federal workers, ranging from tax
collectors to White House chefs, would stay home for a third straight day on
Friday.
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta travelled to Capitol Hill for talks
with Democratic lawmakers. No new talks between the White House and
congressional Republicans were scheduled. Indeed, the major players were
talking to each other only through the news media.
The only sign of progress was House and Senate passage of an $11.6bn Treasury
Department appropriations bill that, if Clinton signs it, would let 190,000
federal employees go back to work. Clinton was expected to sign it when it
reaches his desk in coming days.
Day Two of the government shutdown was marked by a cross-fire of warnings and
recriminations. The White House said ``irreconcilable differences'' existed
between the two sides.
Illustrating the enmity between Clinton and Gingrich, the speaker groused anew
at what he considered shabby treatment on Air Force One on Clinton's flight to
Israel on November 5 for the funeral of assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
Gingrich said he wanted to discuss the budget during the 25-hour round trip to
Israel but was rebuffed, and was forced to exit the plane from the rear
entrance.
``Where is their sense of manners?'' he said. McCurry expressed incredulity
that Gingrich had said any such thing, but said that in any case Clinton was
too shaken by Rabin's death to talk business at that point.
Meanwhile Washington was far less crowded than usual, bereft of many of its
briefcase-toting bureaucrats. On a related battlefront, the two sides are also
at odds over raising the government's borrowing authority to avert an
unprecedented default on the US debt.
Clinton announced on Wednesday that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was forced
to take ``extraordinary but necessary actions'' to keep social security cheques
going out next month.
Rubin dipped into two federal pension plan trust funds for about $61bn to make
debt payments and said that would avert a default through late December.-Reuter

<HEADLINE>More powers for deer commission</HEADLINE>

THE Deer (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is designed to introduce a number of
measures aimed at promoting the sustainable management of wild deer populations
in Scotland.
It is based largely on proposals for reform prepared by the Red Deer Commission
in 1994 after a Government consultation exercise.
The plan is for the commission to promote, and take action to manage, all
aspects of the relationship between deer, their habitat and other land uses. In
particular, the commission will be allowed for the first time to promote action
to protect the natural heritage.
In short, the Bill amends a number of provisions relating to the culling and
shooting of deer, making it, for example, easier to authorise shooting to
prevent damage to the natural heritage or to protect public safety.
The definition of agricultural land over which owners and occupiers can shoot
deer, if necessary, to protect crops and pasture will be changed.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Lord Lindsay said yesterday: ``The Bill
represents an important step forward in the Government's overall policy to
ensure the sustainable development and management of Scotland's natural
resources.''
The chairman of the Association of Deer Management Groups, Stephen Gibbs,
welcomed the Bill's announcement, but added that ``significant progress''
already had been made under the existing statutory framework over recent years
in reducing deer numbers in areas where deer populations had risen most
markedly.
However, he added: ``We agree that there is a need to extend statutory
protection to natural heritage interests; also that some flexibility as to the
statutory deer seasons will be helpful to deer managers.''
Mr Steve Sankey, head of policy and advisory at the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, said:``A lot more thought is being put into deer
management plans, and as long as clear objectives and clear targets are linked
to the provision of biodiversity, they we will be happy.''

<HEADLINE>Rural schools to benefit from placing changes</HEADLINE>

MOVES to ease problems at high capacity schools where parental placing requests
have left incomers unable to find a school place for their children are likely
to benefit rural schools, but not popular urban secondaries, it emerged
yesterday.
As predicted earlier this year, the Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has
acted to overcome the difficulties at Balfron High, within his Stirling
constituency, by amending regulations so that ``certain schools'' will have to
retain ``a few'' places for incomers to the school area.
Parents, teachers, and the school board at Balfron had been pressing Mr Forsyth
to change the rules because incomers to the area were finding it impossible to
place their children in the school because there was no spare capacity. New
arrivals had to be transported to schools outwith the catchment area.
It emerged last night that the changes in legislation were aimed mainly at
rural areas where no suitable alternative school was available for parents to
send their children. The criteria for selecting schools are mainly geographical.
The so-called ``magnet'' secondaries such as Holyrood Academy or St Ninian's in
Glasgow, often over-subscribed due to placing requests from parents, are
unlikely to fall into the category of schools which will be permitted to retain
a small proportion of places for incoming families.
It is understood that provided there is another equivalent school within
walking distance, to which parents who move into the area can choose to send
their children, then the much-requested school will not have to retain places.
Last night, Scottish Office sources were emphasising that the key to the
legislative changes was the principle of ``parental choice''.
However, Mr David Alexander, senior depute director of education in Strathclyde
Region, predicted that many ``incomer'' parents in busy urban or suburban areas
would be angry that their plight was not being considered.
``Once it becomes clear that only certain schools are being considered, I think
a number of parent bodies and school boards are likely to be quite upset. They
will be pressing for their schools to be included,'' said Mr Alexander.
He added: ``Balfron is almost a one-off. All the examples of problems in
relation to not being able to retain capacity are in urban areas.''
The rector of Balfron High, Mr Jim Fleming, said: ``Any move in this area will
be greatly welcomed by the school and school board. We have had a fairly
well-publicised problem with pupils being transported long distances out of the
catchment area in buses.''
Mr Fleming said he hoped the Scottish Office would adopt Balfron High's
recommendation that 2% of school places be kept open for incoming pupils - in
its case 17 places out of a school roll of 850.
There is no indication yet from the Scottish Office of how many places it
envisages should be retained in certain schools.
Councillor Rob Ball, chairman of the education committee of Central region,
said: ``Mr Forsyth has obviously seen the light, although until now he has
resisted it. My only reservation is that it does not specify what proportion of
places would be held.''

Houston, Wednesday
ASTRONAUTS guided the US space shuttle Atlantis to the Russian space station
Mir and docked early today, neatly executing the difficult manoeuvre 245 miles
above Earth.
It was the second linkup of Atlantis and Mir, but was considered more
complicated - and dangerous - than the first because of the five-metre docking
tunnel jutting out of the shuttle cargo bay.
The docking tunnel will be left behind on Mir when Atlantis pulls away on
Saturday. It will make the next five Atlantis-Mir dockings easier.
Shuttle commander Kenneth Cameron pulled within 50 metres, then nine metres, of
Mir as both spacecraft hurtled around Earth at 17,500.mph.
Cameron slowly steered Atlantis up under Mir, avoiding the station's maze of
solar panels.
Docking occurred right on time, easing the tension in space and on the ground
at the Houston space centre. A collision could have breached the two
pressurized spacecraft and killed all eight men aboard.
Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut aboard Atlantis, called the docking ``a
ballet of concentrated effort''.
About 50 US personnel, including astronauts headed to Mir next year and
managers of the planned international space station, watched the docking on
huge television screens at the Russian Mission Control outside Moscow.
Like the first docking by Atlantis in June, this one required perfect timing,
perfect speed and perfect alignment.  Cameron could not see the end of his
docking port while closing in on the sprawling, 120-plus-ton station, however,
and had to rely on remote camera views, radar and lasers.
With solar panels, or arrays, sticking every which way out of Mir, it was a
monstrous obstacle course. Before the flight, Cameron admitted he was concerned
about snapping off a solar panel - or worse.-AP.

Bangkok, Wednesday
A DEPRESSED investor shot himself after scores of protesters rallied outside
Thailand's stock exchange today as the battered bourse continued its recent
sustained dive.
Heavily indebted investor Vivat Srisammacheep shot himself under the chin with
a pistol blaming exchange officials for his losses of over $1.2m from dabbling
in shares. He is in hospital.
The sugar and molasses trader was part of a group of over 100 investors who had
earlier staged a peaceful protest at the exchange to complain about the
bourse's plunge and to call for changes to the exchange's board in hopes of
stemming the downward spiral.
``The recent fall is due to the incompetence of the Stock Exchange of
Thailand's (SET) board and related government agencies,'' said a statement
circulated by the protesters.
The bourse has plunged a hefty 18.8% in value since July, when the new Thai
government came to power, amid worries about the competence of some ministers
to handle the economy.-Reuter.

FORMER Wigtownshire solicitor Giles Davies was sent to prison yesterday pending
sentence tomorrow after admitting two charges of embezzling #2.5m.
A plea of not guilty to a third charge alleging a #48,000 bank bridging loan
fraud by Davies, who practised in Newton Stewart, was accepted by the Crown.
Davies, 40, of Corwar House, Barrhill, Ayrshire - struck off by the Law Society
of Scotland in December 1992 for professonal misconduct - had originally faced
charges of embezzling almost #3.7m.
Yesterday, Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull told temporary judge Sheriff Robin
McEwan QC at Glasgow High Court that the Crown was prepared to accept guilty
pleas to lesser amounts involved.
Davies admitted that between April 29, l983, and May 13, l992, while acting as
a solicitor at McCormick and Nicholson, Symons and McDonald, of Victoria
Street, Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, and at his home, he embezzled #1,165,016
and almost $1m.
He also admitted a similar charge between December 1991 and May 1992 involving
#696,785.
None of the money which went missing has ever been traced, despite intensive
police and Law Society of Scotland investigations. Mr Kenneth Pritchard,
secretary of the society, said yesterday: ``If there is any money which Davies
has salted away, both the investigations carried out by the Judicial Factor and
the police would now have identified it. No such money has yet been
identified.''
A plea by defence QC Neville Shaffer that Davies's bail be continued was
rejected.
Mr Shaffer had argued that Davies suffered from a severe depressive illness and
had failed to bring his medication to court with him.
Mr Turnbull told the judge he would need several hours today to explain to the
court the details of how the embezzlements were carried out by Davies. Mr
Shaffer is expected to address the court tomorrow before Davies is sentenced.
Last night, Mr Alan Boyd, president of the Law Society of Scotland, said
wide-ranging consumer protections funded by Scottish solicitors meant that no
member of the public suffered loss as a result of Davies's activity.
Davies's firm had insurance cover of about #1.3m through the Law Society's
Master Policy and Guarantee funds which paid out more than #2m in connection
with the case.
Almost 900 clients, many of them farmers and business people in Wigtownshire,
were understood to have been affected by the fraud.
Davies, regarded as a pillar of society in the market town of Newton Stewart,
was said by Glasgow solicitor Ross Harper, who represented him at a Law Society
disciplinary hearing, to have been the victim of a ``clever and unscrupulous
international fraud''.
A Rotarian, a member of the local country sports fraternity, and chairman of
Penninghame Primary School Board, he lived with his wife Moira and children
Zoe, 17, Paul, 13, and Jenny, 11, in Barrhill, Ayrshire. He bought Corwar
House, about eight years ago and was said to have a mortgage of #130,000.
A former colleague claimed he had been taken in by a multi-million pound scam -
which was understood to have been perpetrated by a company of rogue lawyers in
North Carolina.
The colleague said: ``He was fed bait a couple of times which made him think
the deal was genuine. Then the next time the cheque did not arrive and he was
in trouble. Davies was always a bit of an eccentric and a social climber. He
was also greedy - and that proved his downfall.''
His case caused such alarm in the profession that the Law Society wrote to
every practising solicitor, warning them not be taken in by the blandishments
of high-powered conmen looking for quick finance.
The ``get-rich-quick schemes'' included raising finance for a 2000-bed Aids
hospice in California, the creation of a million-acre wildlife park in South
America, a senior citizen township in South Africa, and the purchase of untold
numbers of aircraft and ships around the world.
Apart from ending his own legal career, Davies's activities brought disaster on
his former partners in the firm of McCormick and Nicholson, Symons and
McDonald, which had offices in Newton Stewart, Stranraer, and Dumfries.
The six partners, who were either sequestrated or signed trust deeds to pay off
as much as possible of the money owed by the firm, were absolved of any blame
in connection with Davies's activities.
They were automatically suspended pending a Law Society investigation. Five of
them have since taken up with other solicitors' firms in Wigtownshire, while
one has retired.
The solicitors' firm was plunged into chaos in May 1992, when Davies
disappeared. His car was found at Glasgow Airport but nine days later he
arrived home after apparently claiming he had been hitch-hiking.
The Law Society immediately launched an investigation into the firm's accounts.
This followed Mr Davies's involvement in various ``fund-raising exercises'' in
pursuit of which he opened client accounts with the National Westminster Bank
in Guernsey.
It emerged that, at the end of April 1992, Davies had instructed a credit entry
on one of the accounts for nearly $3m (#1,694,844). He then instructed a number
of debits resulting in a deficiency in the client account of #1.8m the
following month.
Leeds Permanent Building Society closed the agency which the firm operated from
its Victoria Street office in Newton Stewart. Soon afterwards, Dumfries and
Galloway Police launched an investigation into his dealings.
It emerged that a cheque issued by the firm for #83,000 as part payment for a
land deal had not been honoured two days before Davies's disappearance.
Meanwhile, other families were running into problems with cheques from the
company, including one family which expected to collect about #500,000 from the
sale of a farm.
If there is any money which Davies has salted away, both the investigations
carried out by the Judicial Factor and the police would now have identified it.
No such money has yet been identified

FREE Church of Scotland Professor Donald Macleod was yesterday ordered to
appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to answer six charges of assault.
The case was continued without plea until November 29 following a motion by Mrs
Pamela Watson, depute fiscal.
Sheriff James Farrell also ordained him to appear on that date.
The charges relate to five women over a period from July 1985 to June 1993.
Professor Macleod, 54, of Craiglea Drive, Morningside, Edinburgh, is alleged to
have carried out four of the assaults at the Free Church of Scotland College on
the Mound, where he holds the chair of systematic theology, and the remainder
at his home and in a car parked at the Cameron Toll shopping centre in
Edinburgh.
In four of the charges, he is accused of placing his arms around the women or
pulling them towards them and kissing or attempting to kiss them.
Two of the charges relate to one woman during 1986 in which Professor Macleod
is alleged to have interfered with her clothing and handled her breasts and
private parts.
Professor Macleod, who is married with three sons, was not at yesterday's
hearing, which lasted less than two minutes.

THE Education (Scotland) Bill, arguably the centrepiece of the Government's
legislative programme for Scotland, will introduce a number of changes.
It will establish a qualifications authority to take over the existing
functions of the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational
Education Council.
It will introduce a voucher scheme for nursery schools and will reform the
procedures for school boards.
In addition, the rules on school placing requests will be modified to cater for
pupils moving into an area during the school year, and the requirement for
local authorities to obtain the approval of the Secretary of State for major
school building projects would be ended.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson said: ``The Bill will contain
important measures and confirms the Government's continuing commitment to
maintaining and further enhancing the high standard of education and training
in Scotland.
``The Bill will include provisions for a new Scottish Qualifications Authority
to take on the current functions of the SEB and Scotvec, and to administer the
Higher Still arrangements to improve post-16 education in Scotland.
``The merger of the two bodies was widely welcomed during recent consultation.
It would improve links between schools, colleges, and training for employment,
as well as promoting parity of esteem between academic and vocational
learning.''
On school boards, the legislation will contain proposals to improve their
operation, including a plan to give all local councillors whose wards lie
wholly or partly within a school's catchment area the right to attend and speak
at board meetings.
Mr Robertson said: ``I believe the Bill, with its combination of improvements
to existing legislation and important new initiatives, ranging from education
for pre five-year-olds to post 16-year-olds, will extend provision, widen
parental choice and further enhance quality and effectiveness in Scottish
education.''

AN armed robber nicknamed ``The Hawk'' was jailed for 12 years yesterday, for
threatening police with a sawn-off shotgun and a knifepoint raid on a building
society.
Lord Gill told Brian Martin, who has a string of previous convictions dating
back to 1976: ``Your record establishes you as a thoroughly dangerous criminal.
You cannot expect leniency in this court today and I can see no reason to
extend it to you.''
The judge said he regarded the assault on the police officers as all the more
serious because it took place in a public street. The effect on at least one of
the constables - who broke down in the witness box - had been all too plain.
It is understood that police in England now wish to question Martin about a
number of armed raids on building society's south of the border.
After a seven-day trial, a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found Martin,
38, guilty of assaulting Constables Neil Stewart and John Hughes by menacing
them with a sawn-off shotgun. The incident took place in Craigie Street,
Ballingry, Fife, on October 29, 1994.
Martin, who formerly lived in Ballingry, pleaded guilty to assaulting three
employees at the Yorkshire Building Society, George Street, Oban, on November
24 last year, presenting a knife at them and robbing them of #4639.
He was also charged with being part of a gang of four which carried out a #8350
payroll robbery in the Fife village of Glencraig, in which victims were tied
up, had their eyes taped, and were threatened with a knife and sawn-off shotgun
on September 25 last year.
Martin also denied abducting a bookmaker and his wife in Lochore, Fife, and
threatening them with a sawn-off shotgun before robbing the bookmaker of #2000
on November 6 last year.
The jury returned a majority not guilty verdict on the payroll robbery charge
and a majority not proven verdict on the abduction charge.
The jury was told that police wanted to interview Martin and were tipped off,
on October 29 last year, that he was in the Craigie Bar, Ballingry. Martin ran
from the pub to be confronted by uniformed officers waiting outside.
Constable Stewart broke down in the witness box as he told how he looked down
the barrels of the sawn-off shotgun produced by Martin.
He described how Martin's long leather jacket flew open to reveal the gun.
Martin had it hung over his shoulder from a piece of string, and swung it up
towards him.
``He cradled the barrels of the gun with his left hand and put his other hand
on the trigger. He shouted at me: ``Back off or I will shoot you.''
Mr Stewart broke down in the witness box and Lord Gill had to halt proceedings
to allow him to regain his composure. The constable told the court that, after
the shotgun incident, he was in a state of shock and was off work for 51 days.
Martin told the jury that, following the Oban robbery, he stayed in a local
hotel overnight, then went on the run for nine months in England, Wales,
Ireland, and Spain.
He was arrested in July this year when he and girlfriend Julie Bryce, 31,
stepped off a cross-channel ferry at Portsmouth.
After yesterday's verdict, Lord Gill pointed out that Martin had been convicted
on 33 previous occasions, involving 54 charges.
In 1987, he had been jailed for six years at the High Court in Edinburgh for
robbing a Fife bookmaker's shop and a building society in Stirling, both at
knifepoint.
The robberies were committed while Martin was on the run from Noranside Open
Prison.

A MOTHER-OF-THREE fulfilled her last wish, to be at home with her family when
she died, with the help of the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Mrs Sally Drake, 37, a cancer sufferer, was being cared for at the Highland
Hospice, Inverness, but wanted to spend her last weeks with her fisherman
husband Peter, 40, and children Christopher, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Elizabeth,
six, at their family home in the remote Wester Ross village of Achiltibuie.
However, Mrs Drake, a district nurse, would not have been able to undertake the
100-mile journey by road, as much of the route is on rough and potholed
single-track roads.
The Scottish Ambulance Service stepped in and took the unusual step of laying
on their air ambulance helicopter, normally used only for emergencies, to take
Mrs Drake home.
They also provided a road ambulance to take a special bed and equipment from
the hospice to her home to ease the suffering of the remaining days with her
family.
After five weeks at home Mrs Drake died and her funeral takes place today at
the crematorium in Inverness. A memorial service will be held in the village
hall tomorrow.
Mr Drake said yesterday: ``I do not know just how irregular it was for the
hospice and ambulance service to arrange for Sally to get home in the only way
possible, but we were all very grateful she could be with us right up until the
end.
``She put up a brave struggle against her illness for more than two years after
discovering it during her midwifery training in Inverness. The last few weeks
have been very hard on the children, but their teachers and our friends have
been very supportive. I have not been at sea since September.''
A spokeswoman for the ambulance service said: ``Normally, terminally ill
patients would be taken home by road, but each case is judged on its own merits
and obviously a humanitarian decision was taken here.''

Ford offers
`best' deal
FORD last night offered its workers an inflation-busting two-year deal, which
it said was the best in the industry.
At the end of day-long negotiations with union officials, the company offered a
rise of 4.75% now, followed by 4.5% or the rate of inflation plus 0.5%,
whichever is greater, next year.
Sixth arrest
A SIXTH person was under arrest last night in connection with the police
investigation into who supplied ecstasy to 18-year-old Essex girl Leah Betts,
who is in a coma. Her parents are maintaining a vigil at her hospital bedside.
Lesson wrecked
FOUR police officers - an instructor and three students from the Scottish
Police College, Tulliallan - were recovering yesterday in Borders General
Hospital with cuts and bruises, after a crash, near Greenlaw, Berwickshire, in
which their patrol car was wrecked while they were on an advanced driving
course.
Bard honoured
NOBEL Prize winning poet Seamus Heaney is to take part next year in a festival
celebrating the bicentenary of the death of Scottish bard Robert Burns. The St
Andrews University festival will also include contributions from Scottish
novelist A.L Kennedy.
Threat to beauty
AN area renowned for its beauty could be facing the threat of rural squalor, an
MP warned yesterday. Mr John Home Robertson, MP for East Lothian, is demanding
environmental safeguards against a massive rubbish dump near Dunbar and private
opencast coal sites.
Facade remains
ONLY the facade of an 18th century building at 25 St Andrew Square, Edinburgh,
will be left in a #3m office extension, a development committee heard
yesterday. The committee approved the application from London &amp; Wiltshire
Scotland on the condition that the roof material was suitable.
Police award
A PIONEERING training programme which has helped police officers protect
themselves has won Strathclyde Police its first Scottish safety award. The
programme involves training in the use of side handled batons, rigid handcuffs
and safety awareness.
Tube strife ends
LONDON Underground's five-month dispute - which involved three strikes and was

SIXTY thousand part-time workers could win #95m in compensation for backdated
benefits from occupational pension schemes, depending on the outcome of an
industrial tribunal hearing which opened in Birmingham yesterday.
The claims, which are being co-ordinated by the TUC, were lodged following a
European Court of Justice ruling in September last year that employers who bar
part-timers from pension schemes could be guilty of indirect sex discrimination.
In an unprecedented move, the 60,000 claims have been put on hold pending the
hearing of 22 test cases at the Birmingham tribunal. They will test key legal
points - including the right to make a retrospective claim and the amount which
can be claimed.
Mr James Goudie QC, leading counsel for the TUC, argued that he was opposed to
setting a two-year limit on the period of retrospection as has been floated by
the Government.
He suggested that if there need be a cut-off point, then a previous 1976
European Court ruling on part-timers would appear to present a more appropriate
date.
If the 60,000 claims are backdated to the 1976 ruling, the TUC calculates that
total compensation could amount to more than #95m and argues this is affordable
given that UK pension fund assets total #500bn.
The 22 test cases, from all around Britain, include teachers, local government
officers, lecturers, bank workers, and NHS employees.
The TUC backing for legal action on occupational pensions forms part of its
two-year campaign to win Britain's 5.4 million part-timers rights to pro-rata
pay and conditions across the board.
TUC general secretary John Monks says the Government and employers must wake up
to the fact that part-time workers deserve to be treated the same as
full-timers.
The hearing is expected to last up to two weeks.

POST Office staff in Glasgow have intercepted a bomb addressed to Shadow
Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson.
The package contained a home-made device, which, although crude and
unsophisticated, might possibly have caused slight injury had it exploded. It
was spotted at the St Rollox sorting office in Baird Street, Glasgow, where
Labour Party-bound mail is being checked following two previous devices.
Police and Army bomb disposal experts were called and the suspicious package
was examined and made safe. While it was being described unofficially as an
improvised explosive device, one source said the device was a ``whizz-bang hoax
which might conceivably have caused a hand injury''. The Labour Party yesterday
declined to comment.
Explosives experts at Strathclyde Police forensic laboratory at Pitt Street
were last night examining the device. The obvious line of inquiry was the
possible links with the two previous devices received at Scottish Labour Party
headquarters, Keir Hardie House in Lynedoch Place, Glasgow.
These devices, believed to have come from Scottish republican terrorists, whose
avowed aim is to achieve self-government for Scotland by the bomb and the
bullet, caused an acrimonious exchange between the Labour Party and the
Scottish National Party.
The first device arrived in late September, an envelope containing pieces of
metal accompanied by threats to Mr Robertson, but the second, on October 7, was
a more elaborate hoax device.
Although no-one had yesterday claimed to have sent the latest ``bomb'' the
spotlight will inevitably fall on the Scot Adam Busby, currently living in
Dublin, who was named in the High Court as the man behind a campaign earlier
this year to drive out the English which resulted in two lesser figures
receiving lengthy jail sentences for sending fake bombs and threats.
Busby's alleged activities in relation to the Scottish National Liberation Army
have been the subject of a recent investigation by the Scottish police, and The
Herald has been informed that reports have been in the possession of the Crown
Office in Edinburgh for some time.
A number of police forces, including Grampian and Strathclyde, are believed to
have been involved and potential witnesses, including journalists who have been
contacted by Busby, have been interviewed. It is understood that exchanges
between Dublin and Edinburgh have taken place in relation to Busby, but that no
decision has been reached.
A previous attempt to have Busby extradited from Ireland to the UK to face
charges failed, but the changes in legislation in 1994 closed the loopholes
which caused previous hiccups between the countries in relation to allegedly
political offences. The feeling in Dublin is that, if the UK really wanted
Busby back to face a court, there would be no real impediment.
All extradition cases are now handled by the High Court in Dublin and prepared
by the Dublin-based Department of Public Prosecution, which should eliminate
faults in warrants and other vital documents which scuppered many previous
extradition attempts.

FALKIRK Labour councillors were accused yesterday of dumping political
principles as soon as all-expenses-paid foreign trips were waved under their
noses.
Labour leader Councillor William Anderson and Provost-designate Alex Fowler fly
to Paris next month to attend a conference sponsored by the new Falkirk
Council's twin town, Creteil.
The SNP on the council insisted Labour should boycott the conference, whose
title - 24-Hours for the Right of Man - was dismissed as ``the ultimate irony''
because of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
SNP leader Councillor David Alexander said: ``I find it incredible that at a
time when France are becoming increasingly isolated within the international
community for the appalling denial of human rights in the South Pacific, Labour
councillors should effectively condone this by their attendance.''
He added: ``It is sad how quickly political principle goes out of the window as
soon as a free plane ticket is waved.''
Councillor Anderson said the SNP knew full well the council had personally
lodged protests about nuclear testing with French president Jacques Chirac, and
also offered Creteil support in making its own concerns known.
Mr Anderson said: ``We have already made political noises and, having discussed
the matter, see no benefit from a boycott. If everyone adopted that attitude,
we might as well close the Channel tunnel, stop boats and planes, and lose our
business and cultural links with France.
``There is no point in being insular. There have been benefits from our good
relationship with Creteil and we do not want to damage that.''
He also denied dropping principles for the sake of a ``freebie''. Under a
reciprocal agreement on exchange visits with Creteil, the towns paid their own
air fares, about #225-a-head, but expenses were covered by the hosts.
Mr Anderson, who will depart on December 7 and return on December 10, said it
was expected nuclear testing would be raised under issues of a general nature
at the conference.
The agenda concentrates on the homeless and underprivileged and is aimed at
discovering how different communities tackle these problems. The conference
will be attended by Creteil's other twin towns in Europe.
However, Falkirk SNP accused Labour of hypocrisy and of paying lip-service to
the nuclear issue.
Monsieur Alexandre Lermany, directeur du Cabinet of Creteil, which is just
outside Paris, said on behalf of Mayor Laurent Cathala: ``It is important that
other people who are against nuclear testing in the South Pacific come here. It
would not help that at all if the Scots did not come.''

<HEADLINE>Pressure on Chancellor for Budget to give party better chance of surviving. Tories hope policies can buy time</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister bought another 12 months in government yesterday with his
programme for new laws next year, but the pressure is increased on his
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to provide a Budget in 12 days' time
that would give the Tories a chance of surviving the next General Election.
Tory voters could be attracted by yesterday's Queen's Speech, but it is up to
the Chancellor to persuade them that it is in their interests to keep Mr Major
in power.
Yesterday the pound fell, largely due to the confusion in the United States
where President Clinton is being denied by Congress sufficient money to run the
administration.
A blip in the unemployment figures in Britain added to the unease, and outgoing
Tory back bencher, Mr Julian Critchley announced that he would not vote Tory
next time.
Despite these unlooked-for reverses, the Prime Minister brought in his new
legislative programme of 16 Bills, which are designed to unite the Tories at
Westminster and embarrass the Labour Party.
Labour leader Tony Blair ridiculed this, but Mr Major, with a direct appeal to
Mr David Trimble, the new leader of the Ulster Unionists, shrugged it off.
The Prime Minister set out to establish that he will maintain his stance on
Northern Ireland. There will be no constitutional talks until Sinn Fein
persuades the IRA to start decommissioning its weapons.
However, last night, Mr Major tried to inject new life into the stalled peace
process. He wrote to his Irish counterpart, John Bruton ,in effort to repair
relations following last weekend's angry bout of ``megaphone diplomacy''
between London and Dublin.
The exact proposals being put forward by Mr Major were not being disclosed,
although Downing Street characterised the letter as ``friendly, constructive
and forward-looking''.
In a moving passage in his Commons speech on the legislative programme, Mr
Major asserted that Sinn Fein must denounce punishment beatings and stop
threatening a return to violence if the 15 month-old ceasefire is to be
sustained.
``We cannot move forward at any price. We cannot move forward with the gun held
to our head,'' he said. ``Each assault, each threat, each so-called warning
puts a question-mark in the minds of reasonable people.''
Mr Blair told the Commons that he will maintain the bipartisan approach in a
quest for a permanent solution to Northern Ireland.
The Prime Minister's problems on Northern Ireland lie elsewhere than the House
of Commons at this time.
He said that for the last six weeks Sinn Fein had been declaring a state of
crisis coupled with a warning of a return to violence unless other parties came
quickly to the negotiating table. ``But violence doesn't return of its own
accord like the daffodils in spring,'' Mr Major said.
Ulster Unionist leader Mr Trimble, who commands nine votes in the Commons as
the Government's majority decreases, listened to these words carefully.
There is little prospect that he will help Mr Blair ambush the Government to
get it out of power on any other issue over the next 12 months. So Mr Major has
ensured with his legislation yesterday and his attitude to Northern Ireland
another 12 months in Government.
The 16 Bills for the new session reflect this situation. There is nothing in
them that will cause a split on the Tory back benches. The Prime Minister
confirmed yesterday that Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay's divorce and family
violence legislation will be put to a free vote in the Commons. There is no
significant European legislation to reawaken a Tory revolt.
The proposed new law and order and education Bills are designed primarily to
woo erstwhile Tory voters and to embarrass the Labour Party.
To regain the political initiative the Government, nearly 40% behind in the
opinion polls, has to re-establish itself with its own natural voters.
The Queen's Speech legislation, embracing an expansion of choice and private
finance into schools and tougher measures against criminals and illegal
immigrants, reasserts the Tory mood on these issues.
Mr Blair may be in some trouble as to how to conduct his opposition to these
measures, but the main thrust of the Prime Minister's new legislation is to
recover confidence in his own natural voters.
However, the Budget statement on November 28, handling both state spending and
revenue plans will be the ultimate key to a Tory revival.
Back benchers at Westminster last night were happy with the legislative
programme but they are still in considerable doubt about whether the Chancellor
can handle the dilemmas about tax cuts and Government borrowing and expenditure.
Mr Clarke has already declared that his Budget statement will be crucial to
Tory election chances. By May, the Prime Minister should know whether he can
reverse what now looks like a Blair General Election landslide.

<TEXT>
A COMPUTER virus writer who called himself the Black Baron was jailed for 18
months yesterday.
Unemployed computer programmer Christopher Pile, 26, from Plymouth, Devon,
appeared for sentence at Exeter Crown Court after earlier pleading guilty to 11
offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.
It was the first prosecution under the legislation.
The court heard that Pile designed two computer viruses called Pathogen and
Queeg, names drawn from the Red Dwarf TV series.
He also designed a device called Smeg - another expression from Red Dwarf -
which, attached to the viruses, made them harder to find.
He wrote what prosecutor Brian Lett described as a training manual, enabling
other virus writers to learn how to use Smeg - which was now available
worldwide.
Judge Jeremy Griggs said damage caused, or potentially to be caused, by Pile
could run into millions of pounds.
What he designed and released would constitute a threat for the foreseeable
future, said the judge.
The judge said he could not accept Pile was naive. He must have known the
viruses would cause significant problems to computer users.
``I dare say you were looking forward to reading in the computer press about
the exploits of the Black Baron,'' said the judge.
He told Pile: ``Those who seek to wreak mindless havoc on one of the vital
tools of our age cannot expect lenient treatment.''
Pile pled guilty to five offences of unauthorised access to computers to
facilitate crime, and five of unauthorised modification of computer material
between 1993 and April 1994.
He also admitted a charge of inciting others to spread viruses.

<HEADLINE>Wage fears over hi-tech jobs `Quality' employment in Lanarkshire may not be matched by Taiwanese firm's pay levels</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ``quality'' jobs on offer in Lanarkshire with the arrival of Taiwanese
company Chunghwa may not be matched with ``quality'' wages for hundreds -
perhaps thousands - of workers at the new factory.
In many cases, the basic pay of operatives at the hi-tech plant is likely to
fall below the UK average weekly income of industrial manual workers.
They are more likely to receive around the #4.15-an-hour national minimum wage
which some trades unions want a Labour Government to introduce.
Chunghwa is to build a #260m factory to manufacture tubes for computer monitors
and televisions at Mossend - creating 3300 jobs - under an inward investment
deal struck with the Government, reputedly worth at least #80m to the firm.
But there could be other, hidden, costs to taxpayers if wages are so low that
they need to be topped up with benefits. These range from help to meet rents
and council tax, to family credit.
Chunghwa is currently studying a wage structure taken from a 1995 pay and
conditions' survey of major manufacturing companies in Scotland.
The Scottish Enterprise survey reveals that pay rates - for the electronics
industry already in Lanarkshire - are as low as #3.13 an hour for process
operators, rising to a maximum #4.25 an hour.
The average hourly rate stands at #3.98, or #147.26 for a 37-hour week. A
married man with two children is eligible for family credit if net income is
below #212-a-week.
Chunghwa intends to have some 2400 ``operatives'' at the factory, according to
Lanarkshire Development Agency.
It is expected that pay rates will fall somewhere between that of a process
operator, currently averaging #3.98 an hour, and craft levels which average
#5.93 an hour.
Overtime, bonus, and - most importantly - shift allowances, could boost incomes
by anything between 5% and 10% a week, according to the statistics passed to
the Taiwanese.
In addition to the 2400 operatives, the plant will employ 600 technicians, 200
engineers, 70 administration staff, and 58 management. With their annual pay
likely to range between #10,000 and #50,000.
Agency sources believe the company will aim for the higher end of all wage
scales, not only to attract the calibre required, but to ensure jobs will be
filled.
The Scottish Enterprise survey shows minimum hourly pay rates of #3.60 for
craftsmen and a minimum of #4.30 for technicians, both rising to a maximum of
#7.60.
Their respective averages of #5.93 and #6.28 an hour (#219.41 and #232.36 a
week), stand below the #272 UK industrial average income for manual workers.
But if maximum rates were met, weekly incomes with bonuses would come close to
the UK industrial non-manual average weekly income of #336.
When the deal was announced by an ecstatic Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
earlier this week, Mr Brian Cole, head of the Asia Pacific desk at Locate in
Scotland, said the jobs offered would be ``quality'' jobs.
There is no question that the jobs involve skills, especially in the
maintenance of the machines which will do most of the assembly work.
However, wages for operatives - which will compare unfavourably with those at
the former Ravenscraig steelworks - are likely to underline just how badly paid
the electronics sector is.
It remains better than some in Lanarkshire, where minimum rates for process
operators in the food and textile industries can be as low as #2.88 an hour.
Meanwhile, Lemac, of Haddington, East Lothian, which lost a computer keyboards
contract to cheaper competition from the Far East, faces laying off more than
half its 420 workforce. A spokesman confirmed talks are underway aimed at
protecting jobs after IBM recently transferred the work to Thailand.

A WOMAN who brought a civil action after being bitten by a rottweiler was
awarded #1620 in damages and loss of earnings yesterday.
Sheriff William Fulton, who heard it had been the dog's second attack in just
four months, made the award against owners Christopher and Jeanette Yates, of
Corshellach, Kingussie.
Mrs Alice MacDonald of Cluny Terrace, Kingussie, raised the against the Yates,
after she had been bitten and knocked to the ground as she walked to the shops.
Mr Yates claimed Mrs MacDonald should have kept a good lookout and watched
where she was going. He also argued that Mrs MacDonald had been walking too
briskly and bumped into the dog, called King, which was on a short lead. He
claimed Mrs MacDonald had been negligent in that she had a duty to take
reasonable care for her own safety.
Sheriff Fulton disagreed. He ruled in his judgment issued yesterday: ``This
woman was going about her normal business and we can't have people inching
towards street corners and peering carefully and anxiously round them to ensure
a chance encounter with a dog does not occur.''
The court heard King had previously lunged at the throat of a 12-year-old
Kingussie boy.
Sheriff Fulton said: ``I am firmly of the view that, after that incident, the
dog should have been muzzled when being taken in the public streets.''
The dog was muzzled after the attack on Mrs MacDonald and later put down after
contracting a fatal illness.

<HEADLINE>Flights `confirm' Dounreay's reputation as world's dustbin Anger at plans for nuclear air cargo</HEADLINE>

ENVIRONMENTAL opinion was outraged last night by the prospect, next year, of 14
cargoes of weapons grade radioactive fuel being flown from Germany to Wick, on
route to Dounreay.
Anti-nuclear activists claimed the news that an offical application had been
made to the German Federal Government ministry, for permission to make the
flights, served to underline Dounreay's growing international reputation as a
nuclear dustbin.
The Caithness plant has already confirmed it will try to win contracts to
reprocess several thousand of the 15,000 spent fuel elements currently
stockpiled at research reactors around the world. They had been due to be
returned to their country of origin, the US, but domestic opinion there has
delayed that, and Dounreay is now being viewed as an option.
Many of the fuel rods in this latest German contract were originally
manufactured for the fast reactor at Kalker, which is similar to Dounreay's
reactor.
The German plant, built at a cost of #2400m near the Dutch border, never came
into operation because the Social Democrat Government would not grant a
licence. The programme has since been abandoned.
Yesterday, a German Environment Ministry spokesman claimed the planned flights
``were safe and responsible from a technical point of view''.
However, anti-nuclear activists here were outraged by the planned movements,
which have been secret until now.
Ms Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, said: ``This is
extremely worrying and very irresponsible. The people at Dounreay and the
German authorities do not have the slightest care or concern about the very
real dangers to the people of the Highlands. Their only motivation is to make
money.''
In Germany, Green Environment Minister for Hesse, said: ``This involves an
irresponsible risk to the populations of both Germany and Scotland.''
The value of the new contract to the Atomic Energy Authority, which operates
Dounreay, was not known last night, but it is expected to run into many
millions.
Meanwhile, more than #500,000 of public money is to be spent to mop up
radioactive leaks which have led to Dounreay Castle - which sits in the grounds
of the atomic plant - being cordoned off since the contamination was detected
last year.

POLICE in the Irish Republic sealed off a farm near the Ulster border last
night after an explosives find, the second in five days in the same area.
The discovery was made at Tonyglasson, County Monaghan, about six miles from
the border. Police will make a full search this morning.
Details of the explosives were not immediately available and detectives could
not say if the find was linked to last Friday's haul intercepted eight miles
away.
The latest find was made in an outhouse of a farm building.
Last Friday, a van loaded with 1700lb of explosives mix was found, with a
further 700lb of explosives located nearby. Police blamed a breakaway
Republican group, the Irish National Republican Army.

THE culture of contempt in an increasingly cynical world must be confronted by
all Christians, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, told an audience
in Glasgow last night.
Dr Carey was giving the William Barclay lecture at Renfield St Stephen's Church
entitled ``Called to serve: Christian ministry and mission in a post-modern
world''.
He warned against the ``privatisation of morality'', the day after the
Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh, the Most Rev Bishop Richard Holloway criticised
calls to return to so-called biblical morality. He said the Bible's moral code
should be updated for every generation.
Dr Carey avoided any direct reference to Bishop Holloway's comments but talked
about ``the dangers inherent in the privatisation of morality''.
He said communism had been replaced by capitalism and a sense of selfishness.
He added that the Christian mission and ministry must adjust to a world that is
losing hope and experiencing excesses of human greed and the destruction of the
environment.
He concluded: ``I firmly believe that in a world where there is no agreement
about shared values, and where a culture of contempt so often holds sway, the
church's mission will be found increasingly relevant and important.''

A CAVALRYMAN riding with the Queen's coach was injured when he was thrown from
his horse during the procession for the State Opening of Parliament.
The horseman fell to the ground when his mount bolted close to the Victoria
Memorial outside Buckingham Palace.
The force of the fall snapped the cavalryman's sword.
The Queen appeared not to have seen the accident which happened behind the
royal coach.
Other carriages in the procession to Westminster had to detour around the
injured Lifeguard as he lay on the ground.
Police and ambulancemen lifted the horseman on to a stretcher and into an

A St John Ambulance spokesman said the cavalryman injured the right side of his
head, his arm, elbow, and hip, and was briefly unconscious.
The horse bolted and returned to the Household Cavalry's stables nearby.

<TEXT>
CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington has been accused of ``a lack of candour'' in
written legal submissions to the sheriff hearing the Lanark Blue cheese case.
The accusation was made by Mr Neil Brailsford QC, for Clydesdale District
Council, which wants to destroy 44 batches of the cheese worth #60,000.
Details of the legal submissions were released yesterday.
The council claimed in a 19-day hearing before Sheriff J.Douglas Allan at
Lanark Sheriff Court that the cheese should be viewed as unfit for human
consumption because it contained various levels of listeria monocytogenes.
Mr Errington's QC, Mr Michael Jones, sent in his legal round-up to Sheriff
Allan, and this was followed a couple of days later by the council's submission
containing the ``lack of candour'' allegation.
Mr Jones, obviously unhappy about the comment, sent in a second submission,
rebutting the allegation and making counter points.
The cheese had been tested by a food laboratory at Bellshill, and Mr Errington
told the council via a lawyer's letter last December that the amount of
listeria was ``small''.
However, it was revealed during the hearing that the sample tests showed a
listeria level of 6900 cells per gramme.
The case had heard that the Public Health Services Laboratory recommended that
blue cheese should not have a listeria monocytogenes level higher than 1000
cells per gramme.
Mr Brailsford's legal argument claims that Mr Errington was aware of the PHLS
guidelines.
Last night, a furious Mr Errington said at his farm near Dunsyre: ``My evidence
on those tests was quite clear and my lawyer's letter to the council was
accurate.
``We said the level of listeria monocytogenes was small because the overall
reading for listeria was at 6900.
``This was bound to include some listeria monocytogenes which undoutedly would
have been small. All food contains listeria and possibly a little listeria
monocytogenes.''
Mr Errington and his experts maintained throughout the hearing that his cheese
was safe and that the listeria found was harmless to people.
Sheriff Allan is expected to announce his decision towards the end of this
month.

THE Lord Chancellor managed to back down the steps to the Throne without
mishap. The Cap of Maintenance did not fall off its ceremonial pole. So the
really tricky bits of Queen's Speech day were successfully accomplished.
The possibility of painlessly reforming constitutional procedures was
demonstrated by the radical innovation of providing three gold chairs for the
Queen's ladies-in-waiting so that, quite properly, they no longer had to stand
beside the Throne while the Queen played one of her constitutional roles as a
rather superior newsreader.
The Commons, who rather go out of their way to shamble along to their
Lordships' House in a manner which stresses the vulgar or popular nature of
their own, are rewarded by being penned into a tiny area which, if a similar
number of sheep or cows were confined there, would have animal rights
protesters abseiling from the glittering galleries in protest.
Back in their proper place, the Commons were not long in living up to their
name. Mr Tony Blair, having said that he could not, of course, drag the Queen
into a political debate, proceeded to do exactly that. Her Majesty might have
been forgiven he thought, if, when presented with the Speech to rehearse, she
had said to herself ``is that it?''
She might have thought she was being hoaxed a second time, mused Mr Blair. The
Labour leader then bowed to tradition by declaring that the Queen's Speech
lacked vision, a line hallowed through annual use by Leaders of the Opposition
down the ages.
A Queen's Speech is occasionally conceded to contain the odd good Bill, but the
L of O points out that they are uncontroversial Bills that his lot would also
have introduced had the electors been more discerning at the last election. But
most Bills are bad, some even dangerous and the thing that no Government ever
shows is ``vision''.
Mr Blair, who was in his running-for-President vein, declared grandly, so we
cannot say we have not been warned, that Britain needed ``a giant of a Queen's
Speech'', and instead the Government had produced ``a pathetic mouse''.
He got rather carried away mocking the Tory back benchers who had apparently
been ordered by their whips not to interrupt him as Mr Blair is usually pretty
good at dealing with interventions. After he had mocked them a bit more,
several Tores rose to the bait and, as he remarked, demonstrated the wisdom of
the original instruction.
On the whole, it was effective stuff, although the odd trace of
sanctimoniousness creeps into a Blair speech. He should take something for it
before it becomes a habit.
Technically within his rights in attacking Tory MPs for sending their children
to private schools, he seemed oblivious to the fact that the London Oratory
school is hardly your average state comprehensive. Scolding the Government for
going for ``whatever can squeeze a headline out of tomorrow's papers'' was,
given the ceaseless activities of his own spin doctors, in the whited sepulchre
class of political utterance.
Britain was crumbling. Mr Major had lurched towards the right to whom he owed
his re-election, an analysis which failed to account for Mr Michael Heseltine's
occupancy of the post of Deputy Prime Minister.
Mr Major seems far more in danger of becoming a prisoner of his own spin
doctors than of the right. He is better being quiet and reasonable. But the
doctors prescribe material which might be described as macho schizophrenic.
First he attacked Mr Blair's ``cheap and silly soundbites'' and ``silly name
calling'' then, barely pausing for breath, said the Labour leader had been
talking ``total baloney'', ``copper plated nonsense'', and ``humbug.'' Humbug
indeed.
He manoeuvred his way round Labour's current favourite statistic that Britain
has fallen from 13th to 18th place in the world prosperity league and, more
tellingly because more convincingly, suggested that while Mr Blair may have
lurched to the right we could feel much less certain about much of the rest of
his party.
Mr Blair then, on points, partly because the Queen's Speech hardly seems to
amount to a coherent strategy and has certainly not got the Government off the
ropes. The Tory problem was illustrated by the confident laughter from the
Opposition side which greeted the only witty intervention of the day.
Mr Gyles Brandreth, seconding the loyal address, was in full flow about the
multifarious attractions of his constituency, the fine city of Chester. ``Two
thousand years of history,'' he enthused. ``And a thousand majority,'' shouted
a voice of doom.

Corneliu Coposu, Romanian politician; born April 20, 1914, died November 11,
1995
CORNELIU Coposu, the respected leader of Romania's opposition who died on
Saturday, was a mild but uncompromising man whose own life vividly mirrored
Romania's harsh ordeal under Communist rule. ``He was a national symbol,'' one
senior opposition leader said. ``A whole world has gone with him. Coposu was
the kind of person whom friends loved and enemies had to respect.''
Coposu, chairman of the National Peasant Party (PNTCD), became the uncontested
leader of the Democratic Convention (CD) opposition bloc after the 1989
collapse of communism. He became identified as the soul of opposition to the
ruling neo-communist Party of Social Democracy in Romania, and the embodiment
of Western democratic values.
He always kept his tall frame erect despite the years and untold tortures he
endured in communist political prisons. Coposu won praise even from his
political rivals, who said they could not help admiring his moral strength,
despite their different political views.
With Coposu as spiritual leader, the CD was cemented by what he used to
describe as a shared dedication to restore the rule of law to Romania, to
dismantle the remnants of communist structures, and to make the country a
genuine democracy.
``Recently I met one of my former torturers in the street. I smiled, pitying
him for lowering himself to torture         people,'' Coposu said in an
interview last year.
Coposu was born in 1916, in the village of Bobota, in Transylvania, then under
Austro-Hungarian rule. Both his grandfathers were Greek Catholic priests who
supported the Romanian national cause in Transylvania, as did his father, also
a priest. Coposu was educated at the Greek Catholic college at Blaj, and at
Cluj University where he studied law.
He joined the National Peasant Party in 1932 and became private secretary to
its leader, Luliu Maniu. During the Second World War, Coposu was closely
involved with British efforts to assist his party, and, after the pro-German
dictator General Ion Antonescu came to power in 1940, helped maintain contact
with Britain to provide political intelligence.
In 1947 Moscow-backed communists took power in Romania and had Coposu arrested
and sentenced to 25 years of hard labour for ``high treason and subversion
against the working class''.
Seventeen years later, when he walked out of jail in 1964, the former
university heavyweight weightlifting champion had lost half his body weight. He
had also forgotten how to speak after spending the final eight years of his
sentence in solitary confinement.
Though he had a degree in legal science, he was not allowed to practise law in
the communist era. He worked for several years as a mechanic on a building site
and then as an economist. He retired in 1976 but, after the 1989 revolt which
overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, he became one of Romania's most active
politicians.
He underwent lung surgery in a German clinic last year, and was readmitted to
hospital in October where he died following severe breathing and heart
problems. His Swiss-born wife Arlette died in jail after serving 14 years
of a life sentence with            hard labour. Coposu never remarried.
An estimated 60,000 mourners filled the streets of Bucharest on Tuesday for his
funeral. Old and young, many in tears, filed into Revolution Square where
Coposu's coffin was placed on a wreath-laden podium. Taxi drivers draped their
cars with the Romanian tricolour and gipsy flower-sellers sold mauve
chrysathemums to mourners who threw them on to the bier.
The mayor of Bucharest, Crin Halaicu, proclaimed Tuesday an official day of
mourning in the capital, and said that a street and market-place would be named
after Coposu.
President Ion Iliescu, a former communist, now of the ruling Party of Social
Democracy, was on a visit to Egypt and did not attend the funeral. Instead, he
was represented by the speaker of the Senate, Oliviu Gherman, who attracted
boos from the crowd when he spoke.
Coposu was strongly royalist, arguing that only a monarchy could preserve
Romania's dignity as a strong European country. In honour of his beliefs, some
people carried banners for exiled King Michael, who was not allowed to return
to Romania to attend the funeral. However his wife, Anne de Bourbon-Parme, and
two of his daughters were greeted warmly in the capital earlier in the week.

<RECORDNO>975356122</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TORY MP Sir Julian Critchley yesterday revealed he will not vote for the party
at the General Election.
Mr Critchley, who is stepping down from his Aldershot constituency at the next
election, said his decision was based on objections to Mr Christopher Gill, the
anti-European MP for Ludlow, the constituency where he will spend his
retirement.
He would not back Labour or the Liberal Democrats, Mr Critchley said.
He announced his decision in a newspaper article in which criticised the ``less
well-educated, deeply prejudiced and chauvinist'' Tory Party left by Margaret
Thatcher, and wrote off the chances of a Tory election victory.
The timing of the attack, on the day the Government unveiled its legislative
package, will infuriate John Major and his Ministers.
Sir Julian, who has been no stranger to controversy during his political
career, said he could not bring himself to vote for Mr Gill, who was one of
nine Tories briefly kicked out of the parliamentary party over Europe at the
turn of the year.
Sir Julian said Mr Gill, would take Britain out of Europe.
``Gill sits for Ludlow where, it so happens, like Horace, I will spend my
retirement,'' Mr Critchley wrote in London's Evening Standard.
``Should I then vote for Gill at the election? Should any Tory who has been
pro-Europe since the days of Harold Macmillan and a member of the One Nation
group of Tories be obliged to vote for a candidate who not only lost the party
whip in 1994, but voted for John Redwood in 1995 and does not seem to care
whether his party wins or not?
``I shall sit on my hands. Blair's new Labour Party holds no attraction for me
and nothing on earth would persuade me to vote for the Liberals.''
Almost more damaging than the revelation that he will not vote Tory was his
assessment that the Tories were ``unlikely'' to win the next election and would
lurch to the right in Opposition.
``Ken Clarke could pull a rabbit out of the hat, but were we to be defeated in
1996, the rump of the party would be an unattractive blend of English
nationalists, radicals, and populists,'' he said.
``Little Englanders, we would be out of office for eight years or more.''
He predicted that John Major and Michael Heseltine would refuse to lead such a
party and the right-wing Mr Redwood would defeat Mr Clarke for the job.
Former MPs from the right, whom he dubbed a ``mixture of the clever and the
crass'', were lining up for new seats and would change the nature of the party.
Turning to Baroness Thatcher, Mr Critchley added: ``It is all Margaret's fault.
``A simple woman who was too big for her boots, she turned what was essentially
a non-political party, a party of few but essential beliefs. . . into an
ideological crusade, the objectives of which are either unattainable or
undesirable.''
Tory policies were balancing isolation from both Europe and the United States
with an endless quest for worldwide free trade and zero inflation.
``Little wonder Tony Blair is laughing all the way to the bank,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Glasgow University's gamekeeper-turned-poacher gives his first major interview to The Herald Principal hits out at funding by results</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL Government scheme to improve academic standards by introducing
performance-related funding in higher education has been opposed by Scotland's
newest university chief.
Professor Graeme Davies, who took over as Principal of Glasgow University last
month, said he did not believe in output-based funding for teaching students.
In his first interview since becoming chief executive of Scotland's biggest
university, Professor Davies told The Herald that the idea, in a consultation
paper sent by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to the 21
institutions it funds, could be counter-productive by further threatening
standards. His criticisms are significant because, before coming to Glasgow
University, he was chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for
England.
The consultation paper, which has caused widespread concern in Scottish higher
education, said that a move to output-based funding might arise before 1997 but
emphasised that it should not be regarded as council policy.
Professor Davies said: ``I think the funding council was under considerable
pressure from central Government to ask the question because there was concern
that one of the consequences of the expansion in student numbers had been a
drop in standards.
Institutions receive an amount of money for each full-time funded place each
year, taking account of actual enrolments and the previous year's funded
places. However the council says this does not measure output because there are
no guarantees that enrolments convert into qualified graduates.
Funding output would give institutions greater incentives to match student
abilities to courses and encourage them to help students experiencing
difficulties. Funding could be awarded on the basis of final qualifications and
successful completion of a year's study or individual units or other chunks of
learning.
The council concedes there are big drawbacks. With strong financial incentives
to secure outputs, institutions could drop standards to allow more students to
pass.
Access to some courses could be restricted to those students seen to have
better chances of passing, partly because they would need less support, which
has a cost. Institutions could also cut the number of places in disciplines
which had higher failure rates.
Davies also said he would be prepared to ``be at the barricades'' fighting for
the Scottish four-year honours degree, which some fear could be under threat.
``I did a four-year degree and I think it is part of the whole process of
intellectual and personal development,'' he said.
No other university chief can be so well placed to exploit the lessons of
poaching, gamekeeping, and poaching again than Professor Davies. Before he
became funding council chief executive in 1991, Professor Davies was
vice-chancellor of Liverpool University. A New Zealander of Scots and Welsh
descent, he is a career academic who had responsibility for bringing the
polytechnic and university sectors together in a single funding council for
England's 144 HE institutions.''
After about three years in the post, he wanted to return to the academic
community. Glasgow University had then started the search for a Principal to
take over from Sir William Fraser, whose retiral was imminent.
Although offered an extension to his five-year stint with the funding council,
it was an easy decision to come to Glasgow, he said. ``My experience of
Liverpool made it very clear to me that I liked large, multi-disciplinary,
city-based universities which had very strong links with their communities.''
``Glasgow is a university which has all of the structure, background, and look
that I had been seeking,'' he said. There was a rustling of gowns, however,
when it emerged that a part-time senior research fellow's post had been created
for Florence, the new Principal's wife.
Professor Davies said he understood the concerns but pointed out that his wife
was a career academic in her own right. It was increasingly the case that, when
academic appointments were being made, the requirements of a spouse had to be
taken into account. Professor Davies's wife was a research director at Bristol
University when he worked for the funding council in the city.
Researchers are a valuable commodity these days, particularly with the deadline
for submitting research materials for the forthcoming research assessment
exercise looming. On current figures, about #95m a year in public funds will be
riding on the results of the exercise, which will involve institutions'
submissions being rewarded on the basis of a seven-point scale.
The older universities have been so concerned to maintain or improve their
ratings and some of the new ones so determined to make an impact in research
that a transfer market among researchers has emerged. Professor Davies believes
talk of such a market for researchers' expertise and publications is over-rated
but he is concerned about the phenomenon of ``non-traditional'' universities,
particularly in England, seeking to establish a research base overnight.
Not that Professor Davies is against competition. ``There has been some debate
about whether the emphasis on selective funding of research based on quality
should be maintained. I believe it is essential for the country's good.''
Higher education investment is focusing on institutions with the greatest
research strengths and Professor Davies believes that the national policy of
allocating resources to selected centres of excellence should be practised
within the university.
At Liverpool University, he rewarded excellence and sought to use money
selectively to that end. He is a planner who leads from the front. He believes
in consultation but not consensus, which must mean that he will do what he
believes is best for the university, even if it might go against a vested
interest.
He paid tribute to his predecessor, Sir William, whose support during the
handover enabled him to ``hit the ground running''.
The Principal wants to build on the work which has been done to enhance the
university's research ratings since the last assessment exercise to strengthen
further an area which is central to a traditional university's purpose. ``I
would expect over the next three to five years to see our postgraduate activity
grow, particularly in taught masters courses. I would also see the straight
postgraduate base building as well,'' he said.
Professor Davies said Glasgow would have to ``work with the grain of the
community and social change'' to ensure that it had a role in the continuing
professional upgrading of graduates.
The Government's policy is to consolidate student numbers and Professor Davies
does not expect to see Glasgow's undergraduate body growing. He believes the
university has the necessary breadth and depth among its undergraduates,
continues to recruit students in the numbers, and of the calibre, it requires,
and has systems in place to monitor and maintain quality.
At a time of intense competition for scarce resources in the higher education
sector, the Principal argues that institutions should more than ever play to
their strengths and avoid being sidetracked by peripheral issues. Scotland
already boasts a participation rate in higher education of 40% among its young
people and if expansion is to come along again Professor Davies would like it
to be strategic, reflecting the different skills and aims of different
institutions.
That implies more of a planning role for the Scottish funding council,
something which it lacks and is sensitive about. Perhaps Professor Davies, the
former gamekeeper who jokes that his experience on that side of the fence might
make him a better poacher, knows something we don't.

ALL major American television networks were yesterday competing in the auction
for rights to Panorama's interview with the Princess of Wales.
Although no deal has yet been struck, it seems likely the one-hour interview
will be seen by vast numbers around the world - with a potential audience of
200 million in the US alone.
``I think you can assume that all three networks are interested,'' an ABC
source said yesterday. ``We are in discussions and I am sure CBS and NBC are as
well.''
As soon as the programme, to be shown on BBC1 on Monday, was announced, BBC
Worldwide was inundated with calls from television stations around the globe.
A spokeswoman said yesterday: ``There was a lot of enthusiasm yesterday and now
we are getting down to the nitty gritty of negotiations. It's normal practice
to license a programme to just one broadcaster in each territory.''
The unprecedented interview is expected to break all the BBC's international
sales records for a single factual programme. Thatcher: The Downing Street
Years grossed $1m in overseas sales.
The BBC will also show the Panorama programme on its own international
satellite station BBC World, available to 43 million homes with dishes or cable
but it has not been decided when.
Palace officials fear the interview could have lasting consequences for the
monarchy. However, the text of the interview is being kept a closely-guarded
secret by the BBC.

EXCLUSIVE
BRITAIN'S biggest sale of public forests is to go ahead near Sanquhar,
Dumfriesshire.
The four forests comprise 9000 acres of prime woodland in Upper Nithsdale, in
the constituency of Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang.
The Forestry Commission confirmed its decision to sell in a letter to Mr John
Davies, who, before he retired, was the Forestry Commission's Conservator for
the south and the west of Scotland.
Opponents say the sale of the forests, Euchanhead, Polskeoch, Shinnelhead, and
Cairnhead, will destroy a major source of jobs and recreational land in the
area and put at risk rare birds, including eagles and goshawks.
Mr Davies said the sale would make it impossible for the Forestry Commission to
guarantee continuity of supplies for the timber industry. ``What it amounts to
is that, in the last twinges of this Government, they will make it impossible
for the Forestry Commission ever to expand again. They are destroying its
core.''
He added: ``The Forestry Commission is a good viable industry in Scotland,
creating jobs and recreational activities. Now it is all being sold off. It is
simply privatisation by the back door.''
Mr Davies said he had been unable to get support from Mr Lang who had
``acquiesced'' in the sale of a source of jobs in an area where unemployment
was at 26%.
An attempt to get a public-access agreement in place before the sale is to be
made at a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council's planning
committee.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said last night: ``There is no doubt
that this is privatisation by the back door. Such huge sales in Ian Lang's
backyard smack of a scorched-earth sales policy in advance of the election.''
The Herald disclosed yesterday how only one woodland sold by the Forestry
Commision in Scotland was covered by a public-access agreement.
Since the Forestry Commission began selling off woodland in 1981, as part of
the Government's privatisation programme, 801 forests in Scotland have been
sold, covering around 180,000 acres.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth's vision for Scots Bid to thwart home rule lobby</HEADLINE>

A TACTIC to steal the thunder of constitutional reformers will be used by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth when he takes on the home rule lobby by
setting out his own agenda for change on St Andrew's Day.
In tandem with the Government's policy proposals contained in the Queen's
Speech yesterday, Mr Forsyth announced that he would make his own speech on
November 30, the day on which the Scottish Constitutional Convention will
launch its plans for a parliament in Edinburgh.
His own vision for Scotland's future political structures will build on the
``taking stock'' process started by his predecessor, Mr Ian Lang.
It is understood that Mr Forsyth will propose that much more wide-ranging
legislative powers be given to the Scottish Grand Committee, reducing
Westminster's role in the passing of Scottish Bills. An enhanced role for
Scottish Questions is also understood to be under consideration.
Bringing more parliamentary sessions North of the Border is unlikely to satisfy
the demands of home rulers, however, and Mr Forsyth's plan to make his
announcement on November 30 brought derision last night from the convener of
the convention.
Canon Kenyon Wright said: ``This was entirely predictable. It is a kind of
compliment to the convention that everything Mr Forsyth says and does is a
reaction to our work.
``We will judge him on the single acid test: does he give further democratic
control to the Scottish people? The day he does that, I might say how wonderful
it is that he has changed.''
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, said of the idea that ``taking
stock'' might be extended: ``We have heard all this before and I don't think
the Scottish people will be impressed this time round. If he is recognising
that there is a demand for real change, then we will welcome that conversion,
but people want devolution and will not settle for anything less.''
Opposition parties condemned the Queen's Speech as the worst in living memory;
short on vision and representing the ``fag-end'' of an administration.
As he launched the Scottish sections of the Queen's Speech yesterday, Mr
Forsyth said: ``I will use the St Andrew's Day speech to spell out my
proposals, which will be new and workable. The Opposition, meanwhile, are
serving up the same cauld kale het up.''
He claimed that the one thing Labour could not say was that the Government had
run out of steam, because the Queen's Speech was ``bursting with Bills'' and
there was ``a good programme for Scotland''.
He claimed that most people would see a ``golden thread'' running through the
Government's proposals, which would give individuals more choice about their
own affairs, and would build on what the Tories had started in 1979.
A further hint of how Scottish legislation might be treated in future was given
in the Lords last night by the Government's senior spokesman in the Upper
House, Viscount Cranborne.
He referred to the treatment of the Children (Scotland) Bill in the last
session, which he said had benefited from from the taking of evidence in
Scotland before its detailed consideration in Parliament.
He told peers: ``If a Scottish Bill were to start in your Lordship's House in
this session, it might conceivably benefit from similar attention. I hope
therefore to discuss, with the usual channels in the first instance, whether it
might be desirable and practicable that, by way of an experiment, a Scottish
Bill might be committed to a committee with power to meet and take evidence in
Scotland.''
He said he would be interested in any general reaction from peers to the idea.
Central to Mr Forsyth's initiative will be a Bill to tighten control on raves,
which will be dealt with through the special committee procedure.
This means that evidence

A DRUG pioneered by Scots can reduce the risk of heart attacks by one third,
doctors revealed yesterday.
More than 6500 middle-aged men have taken part in a seven-year experiment using
a cholesterol-lowering agent, pravastatin.
The long-awaited outcome - 31 lives saved and 70 heart attacks prevented - is
the clearest endorsement to date for the use of such drugs to prevent heart
disease.
The results of the trial - the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study
(Woscops) - were unveiled at the annual meeting of the American Heart
Association in Anaheim, California.
The announcement by Professor Jim Shepherd, professor of pathological chemistry
at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, was sent through a satellite link-up to his
colleagues at Glasgow University.
Half the subjects were assigned at random to receive the drug and the other
half were given a placebo. It is only recently - with the breaking of the code
so that the data could be assessed - that the participants - all aged 45 to 64
on recruitment - have learned which they were taking.
Woscops is the largest clinical trial so far of any drug in the statin group,
which inhibits an enzyme involved in cholesterol manufacture, and it is the
first trial of pravastatin on subjects who have never had a heart attack but
who, by virtue of their raised cholesterol levels, were at risk.
It also differs from previous trials in comparing not only deaths but other
events. Professor Shepherd said it reduced the risk of heart attack by 31%, the
risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 32%, and the need for heart
surgery or other specialist treatment by 37%.
Unlike some previous trials of cholesterol-lowering agents, deaths from all
causes were also lower - by 22%.
Over the five years in which the drug was being administered, at 40mg a day,
Professor Shepherd said that, for every 1000 men treated, 20 heart attacks,
seven deaths from coronary heart disease, two deaths from other causes, and 22
major heart operations had been prevented.
He added: ``We are in the process of calculating the financial savings which
would accrue from these savings in morbidity and mortality. We have shown that
people who have never had a heart attack can benefit from pravastatin''
The cost of the drug is about #20-#30 a month but Professor Ross Lorimer, a
member of the Woscops executive committee, said there was no question of the
general population in the trial age group taking pravastatin.
``There is no doubt that the basis of heart disease prevention will continue to
be lifestyle - smoking, diet and exercise - but a group of people for whom that
is not enough will benefit from this treatment.''
Dr Allan Gaw, who works with Professor Shepherd at Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
estimated that a quarter of the target group - men aged 45-64 - would have
moderately raised cholesterol, that is, between 6.5 and 7.8mmol/L, and of these
a half would be able to bring it within safe levels by following

MICHAEL HESELTINE was recovering in a private clinic yesterday after a
successful operation to remove a kidney stone.
The Deputy Prime Minister will remain at the central London hospital until
later in the week while doctors monitor his progress.
He was said by aides to be ``in good heart and well on the road to recovery''
following surgery yesterday.
The Cabinet Office has given only the briefest details on Mr Heseltine's
condition and his stay in hospital.
A statement yesterday said: ``Mr Heseltine will be leaving hospital later this
week and intends to return to work on Monday November 20.''
It is assumed he will return to his Oxfordshire home to see out his period of
recuperation - probably in the company of ministerial red boxes - before
getting down to the business of government and parliamentary work next week.

THE trial of Gordon Wardell, accused of murdering his building society

Mr Wardell, 42, a car parts company executive from Meriden, Warwickshire,
denies murdering his wife Carol, who worked for the Woolwich Building Society,
in September last year.
The trial, which opened on Tuesday at Oxford Crown Court, came to an unexpected
stop after a female jury member disclosed information to court officials. The
judge, Mr Justice Cresswell, said: ``Juror 11 has very properly drawn to my
attention certain matters which are such that I must discharge her from further
services on this jury. I direct that she leave the building with my thanks.
``It follows from the discharge of that juror that I must discharge the rest of
you and invite you to leave the jury box and await further instructions.''
The trial, which is expected to last at least five weeks, is due to start again
today.

SCOTTISH Local Government Minister George Kynoch clashed again yesterday with
council leaders.
Mr Kynoch took councils to task over their alleged behaviour during a temporary
halt to compulsory competitive tendering.
He said allegations had been made that some authorities were exploiting the
moratorium on CCT during reorganisation to retain more work for their own
direct labour organisations at the expense of private contractors.
He threatened to reconsider the halt to tendering if abuses occurred.
But the Labour-led Convention of Scottish Local Authorities accused the
Minister of dealing once again in ``innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations''.
Cosla president Rosemary McKenna said that, if the Minister believed there were
improprieties taking place, then he had the powers to investigate them. ``Let
him do so,'' she said.
Mr Kynoch said tendering was suspended to allow councils to concentrate on the
reorganisation of local government.
``The suspension was not intended to provide the opportunity for councils to
bring work back in-house, to increase staff numbers, or to disregard
considerations such as value for money. Such behaviour is irresponsible,'' he
said.
Complaints from private contractors have apparently centred around road work
and building maintenance. It has been claimed that, as contracts expire, the
work is being returned to council staff.
CCT was suspended from March 1995, with the exception of construction work
worth more than #500,000.
Contracts are due to be up and running again by July 1997 for roads and
building maintenance.

BRITAIN'S sheep farmers are still losing millions of pounds a year through lamb
losses and lameness, it was revealed at a national sheep conference at Malvern
in Worcestershire yesterday.
Up to a tenth of the 40 million-strong national sheep flock may be lame in any
given year, according to preliminary results of a new study unveiled at the
meeting.
In addition, lamb mortality is still estimated to be around 15%, although this
could be cut to under 10% if all the current knowledge was correctly applied on
the farm.
Farmers often bought in disease and complaints such as lameness, said Dr Mike
Johnston of the Royal Veterinary College at London University. ``There are a
tremendous number of units that do not follow quarantining rules on new
purchases for the flock.''
He warned delegates that the new animal welfare code for sheep would demand a
properly managed programme setting out health and husbandry activities.
Lameness would be a key concern.
Early findings of a Ministry of Agriculture-funded survey carried out by the
college showed that 92% of respondents reported lameness in their flocks, with
an average 9.7% incidence in the susceptible population. Extrapolated to the
national flock, this meant there were 3.9 million lame sheep during the survey
year.
Almost 90% of the causes were scald, footrot and soilballing in the hoof. The
majority of farmers used Formalin footbaths to control footrot. ``But this only
does half the job with the sheep trotting through more on a wing and a
prayer,'' Dr Johnston said, urging the adoption of zinc sulphate solutions.
He also accused farmers of being over-zealous in trimming sheeps' feet, almost
down to the main artery in some cases. He rejected the old maxim ``if you don't
draw blood, it's not properly trimmed''. The study is being continued.
Also speaking at the conference, which was organised by the National Sheep
Association and Ciba Animal Health, Dr Agnes Winter of Liverpool University's
Veterinary Field Station said lamb mortality remained far too high at 15%,
particularly as there were no new diseases to contend with.
``The majority of prime causes of death are down to factors which have been
known about for years and for which good preventative strategies are available,
or if prevention falls down, diagnosis and appropriate treatment can be
implemented. It is possible to keep lamb losses down to less than 10% if all
our current knowledge is correctly applied.''
It could also be worthwhile taking on extra labour at lambing time to cut down
on the vast losses. On average these are 170 to 200 dead lambs in a typical
1000-ewe hill flock with a lambing percentage of 110% and up to 300 on a
lowland flock of 1000 lambing at 180%.
``At even #1 per kilo potential, that is a huge financial loss, over #10,000 in
the latter example,'' she said.
Meanwhile, mobile sheep dipping contractors have reported increases of up to
70% in demand for dipping with organo-phosphorous dips, according to the
National Association of Agricultural Contractors.
The increase comes as opinion is hardening in support of those who advocate a
stricter approach to the control of scab.
An association spokesman said more farmers were learning by experience that
preventive treatments could free them of the anxiety of trying to control scab
once it had become clinically obvious in their flock.
``Well-organised protective plunge dipping at around 50p a head, done by a
contractor certificated to use organo-phosphorous dips, is often cheaper than
injected medication or DIY dipping,'' he added.
Contractor Ian Mowat of Dingwall said his purchase of scab dip this year was
50% up and several new customers had placed orders for work.
In Sussex one contractor found the number of sheep dipped fell from 100,000 a
year to 20,000 after compulsory dipping orders were relaxed. So far this year
he has dipped 35,000 sheep for farmers and new orders are still coming in.

AN appeal for cash to save the Maid of the Loch paddle steamer has exceeded its
#200,000 target in less than a month.
Dumbarton district's Provost Patrick O'Neill said yesterday: ``We have exceeded
our target and more money is still coming in.''
The Loch Lomond paddle steamer has been laid up at Balloch Pier since 1981 and
restoration plans by a succession of owners failed.
Three years ago, Mr O'Neill convinced his council it should buy the Maid, the
motorship Countess Fiona, and a stretch of land at Balloch Pier for #55,000 and
make a last-ditch effort to restore the vessel.
Ownership of the Maid is to be transferred next month to the Maid of the Loch
Trust which, in turn, has formed the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, a
registered charity, which will pursue further funding. It is thought that the
final bill could be almost #2m.
A major drawback has been the fact the steamer has been pillaged of valuable
engine parts and equipment by scrap-metal thieves since being taken out of
service.
Trust member John Beveridge said yesterday the fact that the initial #200,000
had been raised in a matter of weeks gave the restoration project credibility.
He added: ``We also now have charitable status, which means we are in a
position to go back to those organisations which previously expressed an
interest and take them up on their offers of donations which will now qualify
for tax concessions. A lot of companies have approached us and it proves there
is a great deal of support for the vessel.''
Applications for funding will also be made to the National Lottery and the
European Union.
Mr Beveridge said: ``The ultimate aim is to get the Maid of the Loch sailing
again but this is only going to be possible through partnership.
``The whole thing is taking off now. It was slow to start with but it is
beginning to snowball.''
The trust hopes that the Maid will be back in service by the summer of 1998.

SECURITY for politicians was under scrutiny last night after protesters threw
paint and flour at Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney - and were left free for
20 minutes before being arrested.
It took four 999 calls from Dr Mawhinney's parliamentary aide, Mr Alan Duncan,
before the first policeman arrived.
More than five hours later, an embarrassed Scotland Yard issued an apology for
the delay and announced an investigation into how it happened.
Three women aged between 18 and 20, thought to be from a group protesting at
plans for tighter immigration and asylum rules, were eventually arrested.
The attack, which left Dr Mawhinney clearly shaken, was staged soon after the
State Opening of Parliament.
As he walked towards temporary radio and TV studios in full view of TV cameras,
he was approached from behind and liberally daubed with paint and flour.
With the fluorescent orange paint splattered down his suit from head to toe, he
looked in apparent amazement at the way the protesters remained free from
arrest.
Mr Duncan made four attempts to summon police on his mobile phone. Minutes
later, seeing the demonstrators finally leaving, he ran after them and
threatened them with a citizen's arrest.
A crowd of media and onlookers grew as Mr Duncan held the group for several
minutes before police arrived to assist him.
Scotland Yard said later: ``The Metropolitan Police Service apologises to Dr
Brian Mawhinney and his colleagues for any further distress caused by the delay
in police attending the incident on Abingdon Green this afternoon.''
Dr Mawhinney, 55, whose hair was covered in paint which also penetrated through
his jacket to his shirt, resisted making any criticism of police.
``I don't have any personal knowledge of what the timing was,'' he said.
``Others will pursue those matters.''

THE Government was accused last night of ``passing the buck'' over the dumping

The issue was raised in a late-night Commons debate by Labour MP George
Foulkes, who said he and his colleagues were fed up being passed from one
department to another in what appeared to be a ministerial game of pass the
parcel.
What he wanted, he said, was a full survey of the area and the suspension of
all commercial activity until full clearance had been given.
With support from Mrs Ray Michie, Liberal Democrat MP for Argyll and Bute, Mr
Foulkes said meetings with Ministers had been a record of evasion.
He argued that the Ministry of Defence, the Scottish Office and the Department
of the Environment should co-ordinate their actions.
He told the House: ``We want this cleared up and sorted out.''
Liberal Democrat Mrs Ray Michie (Argyll and Bute) warned: ``Lessons must be
learned for the future, if anything more is to be dumped at sea, that we don't
necessarily know how they will react, how they will decompose and what will
come back to haunt us in 30-40 years' time.''
Replying for the Government, Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames said: ``This
is a matter which has led to some alarmist speculation.''
He insisted: ``There was never any secrecy about the dumping operations
undertaken at Beaufort's Dyke.''
An estimated one million tons were disposed of at the site. Surviving records
showed some 14,600 tons of five-inch artillery rockets filled with phosgene
were dumped there between July and October 1945.
``There is however no evidence to suggest that any munitions containing nerve
or biological warfare agents were dumped by the MoD in Beaufort's Dyke, the
Irish Sea or the North Channel, and nor did we dispose of radioactive waste in
these areas.''
Preliminary results of water samples taken at Beaufort's Dyke in the summer
showed no degradation in water quality, he said.
Mr Soames said his department had made considerable efforts to locate and
release any material about past sea dumping.
``There really truly are no grounds for accusations of secrecy, cover-ups, or
of complacency.''
Yesterday Defence Secretary Michael Portillo sent MPs a report on past
sea-dumping operations at Beaufort's Dyke.
The report includes a chronology of dumping operations from 1945 until
Beaufort's Dyke was last used in 1976, and an inventory of munitions known to
have been disposed of in the area.
Copies of his report have been placed in the Commons library.

COULD she be the next Elizabeth Hurley - and much, much more besides? Freed
from the shackles of her royal responsibilities, the Princess of Wales would be
a highly marketable commodity, and, like her rugby-playing, one-time chum Will
Carling, could set herself up as her very own company, Diana Ltd.
She could sponsor sports equipment as tennis players and runners do, or, like
film stars, promote make-up and soaps.
She could augment her income by accepting free use of cars, giving Hello!
magazine access to her home, regularly wearing some designer's clothes, shoes
or hats, using somebody's handbags, although probably not a furrier's furs
because of the animal rights issue, and launch her own perfume. Like Lady
Thatcher and many more she could even give after dinner speeches - for a fee.
She could have her own celebrity newspaper column, like Janet Street-Porter in
the Observer, or Hillary Clinton in the Standard, and while Ms Street-Porter
writes her own words - she was a journalist once - the chances of Mrs Clinton
doing so are remote. The task would, therefore, not tax her command of the
English language since she could have it ghosted. The return from a column
would not be marvellous financially, although, for her name it would be in four
figures at least.
The real value would be in affording her a place from which to air her views on
the issues of the day. And then there would be her memoirs to sell, for which,
given the serialisation possibilities, the sky would be the limit.
The opportunities for the most famous woman in the world to earn a crust would
be limitless, although she would be breaking the royal rules if she dared. But
what is one more broken rule among so many? However, the likelihood is she and
we can only dream about her pot of gold. Although Diana Ltd is an intriguing
prospect, the House of Windsor would never allow her to get to that particular
end of the rainbow.
It will ensure she has no need to earn her living and, given that Prince
Charles has an annual income of around #2.8m a year, while the Queen is the
richest woman in the land, The Firm can afford to keep her in the style she has
become accustomed to.
Some measure of what she would be worth to a company or product she favoured
was assessed recently by Majesty Magazine. It monitored the coverage she was
given by the British tabloids over a two month period, and the amount of free
publicity the products she had used or mentioned received as a result. It came
to more than #1.8m. It is difficult to assess how valuable she is to a
magazine's circulation, but she is due to be on the cover of Harper's next
month and has twice been on the cover of Vogue. Magazines only put faces on
their covers which help sales, although Diana's picture alone is not as good as
Diana's picture and a story. But she invariably provides the latter, as she has
this week.
If there was a fee for an exclusive cover picture it would be in four to five
figures, again nobody will give commercial secrets away.
What Monday's Panorama programme - Dianorama? - will be worth to the BBC the
corporation refuses to say. Sales information was commercially sensitive and
confidential, it said. But it admited to having been in contact with other
television companies world-wide interested in buying the show and that the
details will be finalised over the next 24 hours.
I suggested it was likely to prove a pot of gold for the BBC. ``You might say
that, I could not possibly comment,'' was the reply. But it is possible to
gauge something of the likely return when one considers that the most
successful single programme sold by the BBC abroad was Thatcher: The Downing
Street Years. That brought in $1m and was made after the Iron Lady's fall from
power, whereas the Princess is still married, still in situ, still centre stage.
Mrs Thatcher had also been one of the more prominent talking heads on world
television, let alone on domestic British channels, for decades, whereas the
Princess has scarcity value. She has only twice before talked publicly on
television, as opposed to being shown making a public speech. The first time,
when she got engaged, was almost monosyllabic, and the second was when a film
was made about the Wales's family life at Highgrove.
The Dianorama, on scarcity value alone, must be worth many, many Thatcher
Years. The only programme which could exceed it would be The Queen Mother
Talks, since she has never been known, wisely, to pass an opinion on anything
in nearly seventy years of public life.
The Princess's one-time gym chum, Will, for instance, can earn up to #100,000 a
year from sponsorship deals. An experienced agent - the Princess would
certainly acquire one - can negotiate a contract worth between #50,000 and
#80,000 a year with a suitable company for a Rugby Union player, provided he
treated promotional work as his main occupation and got involved in the life of
the company, not just turned up at photographic sessions and functions in his
spare time. Will, however, has his own company, as Diana would, hence his
ability to earn more without tying himself down to the corporate life.
Personal appearances at the opening of a gas station or supermarket can net
anything from a four figure to a five figure fee, depending on whether you are
an A or B list celebrity.
The Princess would undoubtedly rate higher than the current queen of the
openings, Joanna Lumley, who allegedly can get around #35,000, or some refugee
from Coronation Street like Reg Holdsworth. Indeed, she would be on the A
double plus list. Then there would be pantomime appearances open to her - Di as
Cinderella or Goody Two Shoes? would be a bigger draw than some Australian from
Neighbours - where the fees are astronomical for two shows a day for four
weeks.
Asked recently whether they would feature a Windsor in one of their campaigns,
nine out of ten of the advertising industry's top ``creatives'' said their
clients might prefer it. Using a royal in a campaign would offer the ``ultimate
endorsement'', according to Mr Trevor Beattie, creative director at the agency
TBWA. ``If we had Di driving a Nissan Micra, we'd sell a million,'' he added,
rather cheekily proposing that she could replace the supermodel Eva Herzigova
in his own agency's ``Hello boys'' Wonderbra campaign.
Diana's potential selling power can be defined by looking at that of lesser
personalities. In May 1992, Sainsbury sold 30,000 cartons of creme fraiche. In
June 1992 it sold one million cartons after the starlet, Catherine Zeta-Jones,
was shown using the product to make fresh fruit brulee, while the tennis player
Sue Barker's turkey and apricot bake resulted in sales of 74 tonnes of turkey
strips in one week, 22 times the normal weekly sale.
Michael Jackson's links with Pepsi are well known. His contract was worth
millions of dollars. Over the past decade Pepsi sponsored three of his concert
tours while paying him $20m, during which time, the company picked up two
market share points on its arch-rival Coca Cola.
Nor would the Princess be slumming if she put herself to market. If a man who
became President of the United States could sell washing machines - General
Electric employed Ronald Reagan to that end - there is nothing to stop a woman
who will now probably never became Queen of Britain from doing the same.
Advisers to the Princess of Wales were left wondering last night where they
stand in future dealings with the ``go-it-alone'' royal, after her
extraordinary decision to talk publicly about her troubled life.
Senior aides have clearly been shocked by the Princess's decision not to
consult them.
Not even the Princess's private secretary, Patrick Jephson, or her press
secretary, Geoff Crawford, knew about her interview for BBC1's Panorama
programme, due to be screened on Monday.
Her solo tactic leaves her advisers now attempting to assess the possible
consequences of what she has to say.
Buckingham Palace does not intend to ask the BBC for a preview of the hour-long
interview.
The Princess agreed to talk to the current affairs programme about her family,
marriage break-up, and future plans.
She has chosen to air private thoughts on prime-time TV rather than address any
grievances privately within the royal family.
Despite the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Queen has
always kept an ``open door'' for her daughter-in-law.
The Princess, accused by commentators of seeking revenge against her estranged
husband, now risks not only further distancing herself from her staff but also
from senior royals.
Palace officials fear the interview could have lasting consequences for the
monarchy.
Everything depends on the exact text of the interview, which is being kept
secret by the BBC.
The Princess's decision has taken the royal family into uncharted waters and
officials are now trying to keep a steady course.
Major television networks across the Atlantic are lining up for the Panorama
programme. North America dwarfs all other media territories in terms of
audience sizes and money-spinning potential and Americans are fascinated by the
royal family.
``I think you can assume that all three networks are interested,'' an ABC
source said yesterday. ``We are in discussions, and I am sure CBS and NBC are
as well.''
CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius said: ``We have expressed an interest. There's
an appetite and curiosity over here about the royal family. Princess Diana
makes headlines here, too.''
As soon as the programme was announced, BBC Worldwide was inundated with calls
from television stations around the globe.
A spokeswoman said: ``There was a lot of enthusiasm and now we are getting down
to the nitty gritty of negotiations.
``It's normal practice to license a programme to just one broadcaster in each
territory.''
The unprecedented interview is expected to break all the BBC's international
sales records for a single factual programme.
Thatcher: The Downing Street Years grossed $1m in overseas sales.
The BBC will also show the programme on its own international satellite station
BBC World, available to 43 million homes with dishes or cable, but it has not
been decided when.
Constitutional expert Lord St John of Fawsley said yesterday the Princess would
be wise to remember that those who lived by the media eventually died by the
media.
She was embarking on a ``dangerous and risky'' strategy by giving the
interview, said the former Tory Cabinet Minister.
But she had a ``perfect right'' to make the broadcast, and he did not see it as
an act of revenge but as a desire on her part to put her case.
``An interview is now accepted as part of the normal currency of public life.
It really does depend on how the Princess handles it, what she says,'' he said.
``I do think, however, there is a responsibility on the BBC. There should in
these situations be a certain self-restraint, a certain self-censorship,
because this isn't just another married couple.
``I don't think the BBC should have refused it (the interview). What I am
calling for here is some self restraint in the questioning and some prudence in
the Princess.''
Lord Deedes, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, said the Princess's decision
to give a TV interview ``tells us a good deal about the qualities of the
Princess, and the qualities of the BBC''.
He said: ``The first question in my mind is how right it was in a sense to
exploit this by persuading the Princess to take part in this broadcast without
the Queen's knowledge?
``Secondly, in the long run, I fear this may have the very opposite effect of
what she (the Princess) hopes to do, because although I am sure there will be a
lot of people looking at it, in the long run the people whose respect she
desires to recruit will think the worse of her over this.''

<HEADLINE>Labour tells Government it's time to go, as it attacks `irrelevant' Tory measures Major denies he is running out of ideas</HEADLINE>

THE measures proposed in the Queen's Speech are commonsense policies designed
to confirm the Conservatives as the true one-nation party of Britain, Mr Major
declared yesterday.
Denying he had run out of ideas, Mr Major accused Labour leader Tony Blair of
indulging in juvenile point-scoring while backing policies that would destroy
the Union.
In the first day of debate on the 16 Bills contained in the Queen's Speech, Mr
Blair accused Mr Major of leading a ``tired, inept and incompetent''
Government. ``It is time for them to go,'' he said.
Mr Major accused Mr Blair of talking humbug and claimed 16 years of
Conservative rule had delivered low inflation and the most secure platform for
prosperity the country had known in generations.
He warned that Labour's response to the Queen's Speech would be a ``lithmus
test'' for its position on issues that matter to the electorate, confirming
suggestions that this year's legislative programme has an overt political
purpose to ``smoke out Labour''.
However, Mr Blair dismissed the contents of the Queen's Speech as irrelevant to
the true needs of the British people. The Tories had ``been there too long,
they have told too many lies, they have made too many mistakes, they have
nothing to offer the future of Britain.''
In reply, Mr Major compared Mr Blair to a political chameleon, who changed his
colour depending on the issue. His attacks on the Government's record were
``humbug at its very worst''.
Rejecting Mr Blair's appeal to one-nation Tories to back Labour, Mr Major
reasserted the Tories' claim to the title. ``There is only one party and it's
mine that is truly the one-nation party of this country,'' he said.
Labour's constitutional policies would split the country. ``You would start by
dividing up the UK and covering it with a rash of assemblies''. That, and
Labour's willingness to accept the European Social Chapter, would divide the
Union.
The Prime Minister positioned himself on the centre-right of politics, by
emphasising that he favoured neither laissez-faire economics nor the
nanny-state. He grew up dependent on schools, hospitals and welfare, he said.
``I'm not going to kick away the ladder that I climbed as a boy.''
Mr Major took a number of interventions from Labour MPs, who challenged him to
accept Mr Blair's suggestion that consideration of the Asylum Bill be handled
by a special standing committee, free of party politics.
He rejected the suggestion. Asylum abuse was a serious problem, he said.
To safeguard his slim majority of six, Mr Major announced to MPs that the
contentious clauses of the Domestic Violence Bill would be subject to a free
vote, after anti-divorce MPs tried to block the Bill's inclusion in the Queen's
Speech.
In his speech Mr Blair accused the Government of playing party politics with
the Queen's Speech which, he said, was thin on substance. ``The reaction of
most people would be `is this it?','' he said.
He backed the Government over its approach to Northern Ireland. However, for
the rest it was ``the programme of a party which has ceased to have any real
vision or purpose in Government at all. It is about the interests of the Tory
Party cobbling together any old bric-a-brac of legislation that can keep the
Conservative Party in one piece.''
Labour was unlikely to oppose some of the legislation contained in the Speech,
in particular the Broadcasting Bill and defence measures. But on others, such
as education, Mr Blair promised tough resistance.
On the Government's immigration proposals Mr Blair insisted: ``We oppose bogus
applications and fraud and we recognise the need for immigration controls.
However, race and imigration should not be a plaything of party politics.''
The Government was seeking to put Labour on the spot. ``It is a tawdry
demeaning low-life exercise in political tactics. It is everything about using
Government as a propaganda machine and it is nothing about the interests of
Britain as a country,'' he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said the Speech was ``going through the
motions.
``This Government now has nothing further to say to this nation, except `please
vote for us because we are going to give you a tax cut'.'' He added: ``This is
a cut and run programme designed to be ditched at any time for an early
election.
``These are fag-end measures from a fag-end Government''
Labour's George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) said: ``This is a
Queen's Speech designed to try to cling onto power at the next election. It's
going to be a vain attempt.''
He protested that the nursery voucher scheme would take money out of the public
sector.
q.During the debate, Mr Michael Martin (Glasgow Springburn) protested about
``rigid'' formulas used by the Child Support Agency in assessing payments made
by absent parents.
Calling for a review to examine the agency's work in ``a humane fashion'', he
warned that the people who had been hardest hit were men and women trying to
keep up a relationship with their children.
THE proposed legislation in the Queen's Speech includes:
q Asylum and Immigration Bill - designed to crack down on bogus asylum seekers.
q Family law legislation - will end ``quickie'' divorces and introduce no fault
divorces after one year south of the Border.
q The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Bill - would introduce a statutory
scheme for disclosure of material prior to criminal trials to cut prosecution
information to defence lawyers.
q Security service legislation - to enable MI5 to tackle organised crime and
drug dealing.
q Nursery education legislation - to allow parents of every four-year-old to be
given a voucher to buy three terms of nursery education in either the state,
voluntary or private sectors
q Schools legislation - to lift the bar on grant-maintained schools borrowing
commercially
q Student loans legislation - to allow students to get their subsidised loans
from private suppliers rather than just the public sector Student Loans Company
q Channel Tunnel rail link Bill - to allow construction by a private sector
company of a high speed railway between the tunnel at Folkestone and London's
St Pancras station
q Broadcasting Bill - to loosen media rules to adapt to the technological
revolution and allow greater media cross ownership
q Housing and construction legislation - will give more tenants south of the
Border the right to buy their homes.

THE new Labour-controlled City of Edinburgh Council could be the first in the
UK to put together a major package of projects involving a partnership between
the public and private sector under the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
Mr Tom Aitchison, chief executive of the new council, told members of Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise yesterday that it would be impossible to
fund the proposed transportation projects from traditional public sector
sources.
The way forward, he said, was through the PFI. This was consistent with central
government policy and should lead to an increase in the availibility of
Government funding.
Financial consultants Morgan Grenfell had been acting as advisers to Lothian
Regional Council and key decisions on the projects package could be expected in
the spring. The new city council takes over on April l.
The most likely approach would be to set up an Unincorporated Joint Venture
(UJV) or partnership which would be in effect a new compnay involving public
and private sector interests.
Its policy would be set by the council and it would be charged with delivering
a package of projects.
While major construction work was undertaken by the private sector, the council
would act as regulator, setting standards.
Among the projects most likely to be undertaken would be the building of new
rail stations at Edinburgh Park and Gogar, city centre pedestrianisation and
traffic calming measures and the Greenways project to create dedicated road
space for public-sector transport vehicles.

AN inquiry is under way into the radiological risk from radium contamination at
Dalgety Bay beach in Fife, the Scottish Office said yesterday.
It is an extension of surveys carried out by the National Radiological
Protection Board after radium contamination was discovered at the beach in 1990.
Those concluded that the radiological risk to the public was insignificant.
However, it was agreed that there should be a more detailed study.
A Scottish Office spokesman said Dalgety Bay Community Council had asked for
more to be done.
The new work is being carried out by Aberdeen University for the Industrial
Pollution Inspectorate.
A final report, which is expected to be available by April, will give findings
and recommendations.

A SCOTTISH pressure group last night called for more spending on railways and
an end to the Scottish Office's apparent preference for road building.
The Scottish Association for Public Transport, responding to a demand from the
Confederation of British Industry for a national transport strategy, accused
the Scottish Office of pursuing an unbalanced and environmentally irresponsible
multi-million pound spending spree on roads.
The association's chairman, Dr John McCormick, also criticised the Scottish
CBI's support for high public spending on roads.
Instead, the association suggested improved urban and intercity rail freight
transport links, a light rail system in Edinburgh and Glasgow and better air
and ferry links from Scotland to the Continent.
Dr McCormick calculated that the cost of current and proposed road schemes came
to #887m while he said capital expenditure on rail improvements in Scotland was
zero.
He added that this month's fall in Glasgow Airport passenger numbers was a
symptom of bad transport planning.
``In England, the BAA and other airport and local authorities have invested in
rail links to airports. In contrast, Scottish planners are backing the #250m
10-lane M74 extention. The M74 is unlikely to escape public spending cuts and
will, if built, quickly be saturated by urban traffic as demonstrated by the
M25,'' he said.
The call came as protesters campaigning against the M74 motorway link, which
will cut through the south of Glasgow, dumped bags of so-called toxic waste
outside the City Chambers yesterday.
Dressed in boiler suits and green masks, members of the Residents Against the
M74 said the bags contained contaminated soil from areas in Rutherglen and
Cambuslang near to chromium waste sites.
Campaigner Rosie Kane renewed the group's demand for a public inquiry.
Ms Kane said residents were concerned about the health effects of the motorway
and the impact of construction on the chromium waste sites in the path of the
road.

TORY former leadership candidate John Redwood last night challenged the
Government in the Commons over law and order.
Mr Redwood, the former Welsh Secretary defeated by Mr Major in July's contest,
also reiterated his call for #5000m tax cuts during the Queen's Speech debate.
He said on the crime issue: ``The balance is still not right. Too many
criminals are still getting away without being detected, too many criminals
seem to be able to get through a trial when the evidence looks quite strong
against them.
``Home Secretary Michael Howard must again look at this balance.''
Mr Redwood (Wokingham) told the Commons the public backed the Government's
commitment to law and order, lower tax and a strong defence.
He said: ``There are measures in the Queen's Speech which tackle the issues of
crime and housing and education which only Conservatives can do.''
But he added: ``We do need more choice in the public services, higher quality
in the public services, stronger action on law and order.''

W Lindsay Ross, the treasurer of Queen's Park Football Club and a well-known
Motherwell solicitor, died on Tuesday morning after a short illness. He was 74
LINDSAY ROSS had been a partner for many years of the Motherwell solicitors
Messrs Marshall Ross and Munro, and at the time of his death still acted as
consultant to the firm. It is, however, in the world of association football
that Lindsay was better known.
He attended Hamilton Academy where he made his mark as an up-and-coming young
footballer. After wartime service with the Royal Air Force he joined Queen's
Park in 1947 and made his debut for the club on February 14, 1948, at Hampden
Park against Dundee. He played a total of 54 matches for the Queen's Park First
XI, concluding his career on April 26, 1955, a matter of days before his 34th
birthday.
Such was Lindsay's expertise in business and in football that he was invited by
the club to join the committee, going on to become president from 1968 to 1971.
After his term as president he was appointed treasurer, a position he still
held at the time of his death.
The burdens of a Queen's Park treasurer have always been onerous but never more
so than over the past few years with the advent of the Hampden redevelopment
plans.
As treasurer Lindsay Ross was very much to the fore in all negotiations
surrounding the new project and one of his greatest wishes, which will now be
denied him, was to witness for himself the totally refurbished Hampden Park
which he, along with other members of the committee, had strived so hard to
make a reality.
He will be remembered not only as a sound administrator with an eagle eye for
detail but also as a man of quiet dignity. Although football had changed
considerably since the days when Lindsay sported the famous black and white
hoops of Queen's Park, he never lost touch with the reality of present-day
football and his wise counsel was often requested and adhered to by modern-day
players.
He will be fondly remembered by the legal profession, especially in his native
Lanarkshire, but it is perhaps at Hampden where his loss will be most deeply
felt. Although his health had not been of the best in recent months, he still
found time to attend and contribute to the club board meetings, and only last
Saturday was in his regular place in the directors' box for the club's home
fixture against Caledonian Thistle.
Tomorrow he was due to be on the top table at the club's annual dinner but now
there will be one empty chair. Those, however, who will be attending together
with Lindsay's many other friends and colleagues, will remember fondly a man
who strived endlessly for the club that he loved and for whom nothing was too
much trouble. Lindsay, who lived in Bearsden, is survived by his wife Jean.

After struggling for a couple of years to find tenants, Tay House at Glasgow's
Charing Cross has turned the corner.
Landlord Svenska Handelsbanken, represented by joint agents Richard Ellis and
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, has leased the third floor of the 162,000 sq.ft building
to Barclays Bank plc.
Some 30,000 sq.ft (2,787 sq.m) has been acquired and the deal is based on a
20-year lease at an initial rent of #390,625 per annum.
The accommodation will be occupied by Barclays Stockbrokers who were attracted
by the building's large, column-free floorplates. The letting follows soon
after the 20,000 sq.ft letting to the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
Craig Ritchie, of joint letting agents Richard Ellis, said: ``Discussions are
ongoing with potential occupiers for the remaining two floors which can provide
space from 5000 sq.ft up to a total of 40,000 sq ft.''
Barclays Property Holdings advised Barclays Bank plc throughout the
negotiations.
Tie Rack has also found new premises. It has relocated to 116 Princes Street in
Edinburgh, adjoining Debenhams department store.
The new unit has a frontage of 12ft 6ins, a ground floor net area of 328 sq.ft
and basement of 355 sq.ft and was acquired on the basis of a new 25-year lease
with five-year rent reviews incorporating mutual break options. A rent free
period was granted.
The landlords, GUS Property Management, were advised by Colliers Erdman Lewis
and Tie Rack by Chrystal Rooney.
On a back-to-back basis, Tie Rack negotiated the surrender of their existing
lease of 134B Princes Street. The surrender will allow the new landlord, ESN,
to undertake a refurbishment and integration of their larger premises at 134B &amp;
C, along with upper floor accommodation which has lain vacant for many years.
ESN was advised in the transaction by Richard Ellis and Tie Rack by Chrystal
Rooney.

A SHERIFF yesterday ruled that a toddler must live with his grandparents, but
his mother should have access for five hours each day.
Miss Elaine Maxwell, 21, went to Falkirk Sheriff Court last week claiming that
her parents, Richard, 52, and Helen, 51, had snatched her 16-month-old son
Craig from her home.
Sheriff Albert Sheehan ordered that the child should be with his mother from
9am to 5pm, and then she had to hand him over to her parents.
Yesterday, however, after studying a social work report, he granted interim
custody of the boy to Mr and Mrs Maxwell, who live round the corner from their
daughter's home in Redding, Falkirk.
Sheriff Sheehan emphasised that the long-term aim was to reunite mother and
child permanently and he gave Miss Maxwell access to her son from noon till 5pm
every day.
The bitter battle started last month when Elaine's parents removed their
grandson from their daughter's home. They claimed they had looked after the boy
since his birth in June, 1994, and that their daughter was not fit to care for
him.
They told the court that her house was ``a haunt of drug addicts'', and said
her boyfriend Roy McKie, who lived there, was a drug addict and alcohol abuser
with ``four pages of criminal convictions''.
The sheriff said yesterday that the Reporter to the Children's Hearing ``at the
moment is satisfied that the child is in no immediate danger''.
He added that police reports showed there was ``some truth'' in the
grandparents' allegations about the state of their daughter's home and her
boyfriend's drugs and alcohol problems, but he said there had been
``considerable exaggeration''.

<RECORDNO>975356147</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
UNIONISTS yesterday issued a defiant warning that they would not accept any
moves towards a united Ireland.
Their comments came as, in the Commons, the Prime Minister warned Sinn Fein
that it must denounce punishment beatings and stop threatening a return to
violence if the peace process is to be unblocked.
At a joint news conference, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, Democratic
Unionist leader Ian Paisley and the independent Unionist MP Robert McCartney
underlined their entrenched opposition to the current direction of the Northern
Ireland peace process.
The conference in London was called to mark the tenth anniversary of the
UK-Irish Agreement, described by the three in a joint statement as an
``anathema'' to the majority of people in the Province.
``We will not be coerced to negotiate within its parameters or on the basis of
its latest manifestation - the joint framework document which we see as a
one-way street to a united Ireland,'' the statement said.
``That is a direction in which the people of Northern Ireland will not move.''
They rejected outright the current ``twin track'' strategy of the British and
Irish governments aimed at establishing an international commission to oversee
the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons while conducting preparatory talks
with the various parties.
Mr Trimble instead reiterated calls for an elected Northern Ireland assembly to
debate the Province's future -a proposal rejected by both Sinn Fein and the
nationalist SDLP.
He accused the SDLP leader John Hume of personally blocking the plan. ``There
is one obstacle. It is not so much the SDLP as John Hume who reacted without
considering the matter fully,'' he said.
In the Commons, Mr Major said: ``We cannot move forward at any price. We cannot
move forward with the gun held to our head.''
``Each assault, each threat, each so-called warning puts a question-mark in the
minds of reasonable people.''
He continued: ``If Sinn Fein are committed to exclusively peaceful methods, as
their leaders claim them to be, there can be no question of violence returning
and let them say that unequivocally.
``If their commitment is real, threats and thuggery should stop. Killing has
stopped. Much else has not.''
Giving examples of recent attacks, he said: ``That may not be murder, but it is
not peace.
``And it is not a way of behaviour that merits Sinn Fein's entry to the talks
until they have changed what they are doing.''
Mr Major said: ``I want to see Sinn Fein denounce such behaviour and stop it.''
Almost every day brought a fresh atrocity - 250 punishment beatings since the
ceasefire.
``Each assault, each threat, each so-called warning puts a question-mark in the
minds of reasonable people.
``I wish to move forward to negotiations involving all parties including Sinn
Fein. I believe that we can. I shall work for that.''

<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975356148</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND needs urgent upgrading on 12 major roads as the bare minimum to avoid
crippling traffic congestion and loss of business, the national Freight
Transport Association warned last night.
Speaking in Glasgow, FTA president Graham Miller urged the Government to
abandon ``easy option'' cuts to road building and improvement plans. This would
lead to ``economic and environmental pain,'' he said.
Programmes had already been cut by a third since 1989, when the Government's
own White Paper, Roads to Prosperity, had been regarded as a minimum
requirement. Now there was growing speculation that the axe was poised to fall
once more.
``If the Government is serious about stimulating growth in the economy, then it
cannot expect industry to deliver more goods on a failing infrastructure,'' he
added.
The roads targeted include the A96 Aberdeen to Inverness, the A1 Edinburgh to
Newcastle, the A9 Perth to Inverness, the A75 Stranraer to M74/M6 and the A82
Glasgow to Inverness.

A FISH factory worker who quit her job rather than wear rubber boots has been
awarded #369 compensation by an industrial tribunal in Aberdeen. Ms Jennifer
McIntosh, 24, said she did not want to transfer from the salmon department to
the filleting branch of A J Sutherland, Portsoy, Banffshire, which would have
meant wearing rubber boots, because she suffered from varicose veins. She
resigned instead. The tribunal ruled that by ordering her to make the move the
firm had breached a fundamental condition of the contract of employment and
ruled she was entitled to consider herself as being wrongfully constructively
dismissed.

<TEXT>
A BODYBUILDER told a court yesterday how ecstasy drove him ``mad''. Mr Brian
Smith admitted he used four or five ecstasy tablets a week in conjunction with
anabolic steroids to make his muscles look good for competitions.
Mr Smith, 30, of 2F Friendship Way, Renfrew, told the High Court in Glasgow the
practice was common among bodybuilders.
He said that taking steroids caused a fluid build-up. Ecstasy had a dehydrating
effect and was used as a counter-balance.
However, the combination of drugs took its toll and he told the court how he
had gone ``mad'' and had been admitted to Dykebar Hospital with severe mental
problems.
Mr Smith was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Steven Coan, 24, Mr James
MacLean, 20, and Mr John McDonald, 26, who deny that, in Glasgow's Marriott
Hotel in July, they were concerned in the supply of 5000 ecstasy tablets said
to have a street value of #100,000.
Earlier this week, Mr Smith's plea of not guilty to the same charge was
accepted.
He did, however, admit possessing ecstasy tablets at his home and will be
sentenced at the end of the trial.
Yesterday, he was called as a defence witness by Mr Coan's counsel, Mr Gordon
Jackson QC, to tell of the day he was arrested when he went for a drink with Mr
Coan at the Mariott Hotel.
He said he had no idea there was a drug deal going on. Cross-examined by Mr
McDonald's counsel, Mr Donald Findlay QC, Mr Smith denied he was a minder for
Mr Coan on the day of the alleged drug deal, and that he was to have been paid
in ecstasy tablets.
Police undercover officers had told the court of an intricate operation which
netted Mr Coan who, it was alleged, was asked by an undercover officer to bring
5000 ecstasy pills to the Marriott Hotel.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told of councillors' hire and fire powers Claims over son of council leader</HEADLINE>

ALLEGATIONS that the son of Mr Jim Brooks, the Labour group leader on Monklands
District Council, saw his career benefit from being a councillor's son were
made at the Government inquiry into the council's employment practices.
It was also suggested that there was a perception that the council was run as a
jobs agency and that the more powerful a councillor was, the more he was able
to hire and fire.
The claims were made by Labour councillor, Mr Tommy Morgan, one of four
so-called rebel councillors whose original allegations of nepotism and
religious bias led to the current inquiry. It has already been established that
at least 48 of the 1500 or so people employed by Monklands District Council are
relatives of councillors.
The inquiry, under Queen's Counsel, Mr William Nimmo Smith, is attempting to
discover whether any criteria other than merit was used in appointments or
promotions.
Mr Brooks has already confirmed to Mr Nimmo Smith that his son Stephen,
daughter Angela, a sister-in-law, and his wife's brother-in-law are council
employees.
Giving evidence to the inquiry at Coatbridge Town Hall yesterday, Mr Morgan
said Mr Stephen Brooks started as an apprentice joiner and was later promoted
to assistant safety officer but claimed that the council leader's son was not
qualified properly for the job and that the post had not been advertised.
He also claimed that Mr Stephen Brooks had applied for his pay to be regraded
upwards and that the request had been approved by two councillors against the
advice of officials.
``Stephen Brooks' career development within Monklands District has benefited
from the fact he is the son of an elected member,'' he said.
He went on: ``Lobbying and pressure has taken place, by councillors on other
councillors. Outwith this chamber it is not unknown for Councillor Brooks to
threaten people who have spoken out on things that might embarrass the district
council.
``The perception is that there is a jobs agency in Monklands and the more
powerful the councillor, the more their right is to hire and fire.''
Another of the rebel councillors, Mr Jim Logue, spoke of an imbalance in
employment opportunities between Coatbridge and Airdrie, the two towns which
dominate the Monklands area.
Mr Logue, an Airdrie councillor, has spoken frequently of a spending bias
towards Coatbridge at the expense of Airdrie. He instanced the council's
caretaker scheme for multi-storey flats where, he claimed, 33 of the original
36 caretakers hired were from Coatbridge.
Scottish National Party councillor, Mr Neil Douglas, told the inquiry he had
investigated the appointment of the then Miss Fiona Loughlin, who, at the time,
was the fiance of Mr Stephen Brooks, to a clerical post.
He said he had raised the appointment with the chief administrative officer, Mr
Allan Clark, and that Mr Clark had told him he had been on holiday when the
appointment was made and that it would not have happened if he had been there.
When asked by Mr Nimmo Smith what action he took, Councillor Douglas said that
as she had already been appointed, there was very little that could be done.
Evidence will be given today by former staff of the local newspaper, the
Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, which has run a lengthy campaign against
alleged council malpractice.
They will be followed tomorrow by the area's two Labour MPs, Mrs Helen Liddell
and Mr Tom Clarke.

Lothian and Borders Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Graham Power, is one of two
officers currently in Auckland looking at security arrangements at the most
recent conference in New Zealand earlier this month.
A spokeswoman for the force confirmed the police chief was on official business
in Auckland but added: ``No official confirmation has been given over the venue
for the conference.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the Prime Minister had invited the
Commonwealth Ministers to meet in Britain in 1997.
``The city has not yet been decided. Edinburgh is certainly being considered as
the venue,'' he added.An announcement is likely later this month.

OPERATION Eagle - the Strathclyde Police anti-drugs campaign due to finish at
the end of this month - has been declared a success, with more than 5000
arrests and a significant rise in the number of people reporting drug-related
crimes.
Yesterday, Chief Inspector Bob Renfrew said the main aim had been to get across
to the public that something could be done about drugs. He said that message
seemed to be getting across as calls to the confidential crime-stoppers line
had risen by 150%.
He said that, during the enforcement part of the campaign from the beginning of
September to the November 12, 3598 drug-related cases were reported and there
were 2411 arrests. Of those arrested, the majority were young men with 82
people under 16 and another 505 aged between 16 and 19.
Cannabis accounted for the largest part of drugs seized but there were also
significant recoveries of heroin, speed, and ecstasy.
The chief inspector said that, with the operation coming to an end and officers
assigned to the project going back to their previous duties, the force
continued to depend on the co-operation of local communities.
The police effort to crack down on drug dealers was welcomed by Mr David Bryce
of Glasgow's Calton Athletic drugs recovery group. He said the figures
highlighted what the group had been trying to bring to notice, that drug
dealers were operating in schools and targeting young people.
Mr Bryce said the campaign had sent out a clear message. ``There are too many
mixed messages about drugs. The police live in the real world and have to deal
with the problems. The campaign is taking dealers off the streets.''

A WOMAN was seriously ill in a hospital burns unit yesterday after turning
herself into a human fireball in front of firefighters.
Mrs Annette Murray's daughter Nicki, 19, had called firefighters from Stirling
to her mothers' first-floor flat. She said her mother had poured turps and
paint stripper over herself and was threatening to set light to her clothing.
Fire and ambulance crews arrived at the scene at the moment she flicked a
cigarette lighter.
Firefighters wrapped her in a blanket and used water to put out the flames.
Mrs Murray, 37, was taken to Stirling Royal Infirmary before being transferred
to the burns unit of Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Yesterday, she was ``serious but stable'' with third-degree burns to 30% of her
body.
Neighbours of Mrs Murray, in Graystale Road, St Ninians, Stirling, said she had
been depressed.

Lomond Healthcare NHS Trust which runs Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria was

death, of a suspected heart attack, earlier this year.
Mr McNaught also willed similar sums to: the Beatson Institute for Cancer

Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Ex-Service Personnel at Erskine,
Renfrewshire; The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and the Marie Curie

FOUR police officers were recovering yesterday in Borders General Hospital with
cuts and bruises, after a crash in which their patrol car was wrecked while on
an advanced driving course.
The four - an instructor and three students from the Scottish Police College,
Tulliallan - were parked at the side of a road near Greenlaw, Berwickshire,
when a lorry hit a farm crop sprayer and collided with the police Granada.
First snows
SKIERS were given a boost yesterday with the first real snowfall of the winter.
Nevis Range and the Cairngorms reported good snow cover after sub-zero
conditions and although there is still not enough for skiers to flock to the
mountains, a spokesman for Aviemore Meteorological Centre said more was on the
way.

<HEADLINE>Land values back at pre-slump peak</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT ROSS, Farming Editor</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>975356199</RECORDNO>

THE value of farmland has risen by an average of 50% since the 1992-93 slump,
bringing it back to levels which mark the peak of the market in 1989, according
to chartered surveying firm Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
In some areas arable land has almost doubled in value, it says. The market is
being driven by farmers hungry for more land and is supported by some foreign
investment.
The uncertainty which prevailed in the early part of this decade as the UK
entered the recession - with high interest rates and the EU agricultural policy
facing dramatic reform - has given way to a period of buoyancy and optimism,
according to Tony Morris-Eyton, the firm's agricultural partner, in its outlook
briefing for 1996.
He points to a bullish future for farm profitability and, therefore, land
values. He cautions against complacency, however, as overhead costs in the last
12 months have risen by nearly 10% - more than double the retail price index.
Grain stocks have fallen and other essential commodities are no longer in
surplus. UK arable farmers are keen to take on extra acres to make up for land
compulsorily set aside and to spread costs.
``Many can afford to do so,'' Mr Morris-Eyton comments. ``CAP support payments
have been boosted dramatically by currency devaluation.
``At the same time world grain prices, having risen about #20 a tonne in the
last year, are now similar to EU prices. World wheat stocks are forecast at 93
million tonnes, the lowest since 1977-78 and the equivalent to 50 days supply.''
The potato sector, he says, has had record returns for a second year and
prospects also look good for next year.
Deregulation of the dairy industry has led to higher prices for milk and,
although livestock farmers are overshadowed by the threat to live exports, beef
and sheep producers have had better returns. ``Secure businesses are
expanding.''
The briefing highlights some wider influences including world population, which
is expected to increase by 56% over the next 35 years, creating greater demand
for food and good prospects for UK exports.
While harvests and world grain markets seem increasingly to be affected by
unpredictable weather patterns, it suggests the UK's more temperate climate may
be to its advantage.
The green pound - the EU currency used for agriculture - is expected to remain
stable at least until the end of the century, maintaining CAP support payments
for the foreseeable future.
``Although there will inevitably be short-term fluctuations, the future looks
most encouraging,'' Mr Morris-Eyton says.
``If world cereal prices remain stable at over #100 a tonne, as anticipated,
and the reduction of EU support is phased over a decade, the outlook is
extremely positive for UK agriculture and farmland values.''

A GLASGOW city centre office block has changed hands in a #7.75m deal. The BBC
Pension Trust Ltd has sold 225 Bath Street (right) to Roboscot Ltd, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The 88,160 sq.ft building has 37 car spaces and is let in its entirety to
Greater Glasgow Health Board with a tenant's break clause in 2001. The current
rent is #960,000 per annum.
The BBC Pension Trust Ltd was advised by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in the
transaction, while the Royal Bank of Scotland was advised by Ryden.
In a significant Edinburgh deal, Merchant City Properties, a Glasgow-based
investment, development and management company, has purchased a portfolio of
eleven properties in the New Town from Dunedin Property for around #3m.
MCP is a joint venture between Sydney Freed (Holdings) of Bristol and
London-based European &amp; Pacific Limited. Encouraged by the prospects in
Scotland, the company has been stepping up its activity north of the Border. As
well as the new portfolio, MCP has substantial assets in Glasgow's Merchant
City, including two car parks in prime locations and some 65,000 sq.ft of
retail space. Construction work will start shortly on a seven storey mixed-use
building.
Frank Charnock, director of both MCP and European &amp; Pacific, said: ``MCP is
highly active in Scotland and the acquisition of this portfolio will further
enhance our presence in the region. It is our intention to generate income from
the buildings through creative management in which the firm already has a
proven track record. Nevertheless, disposal of individual properties is likely
over time.''
Dunedin, now part of ING Real Estate, disposed of the portfolio in order to
rationalise their holding in the Edinburgh New Town. Roun Barry, general
manager of ING Real Estate, said: ``The sale of this small proportion of our
Scottish investment portfolio is part of a restructuring exercise which has
been ongoing for almost three years now. Prior to the sale of these properties,
Dunedin was the second largest owner of Georgian New Town commercial properties
by         number.''
Jones Lang Wootton acted for Dunedin, while MCP was advised by Burns and
Partners.
