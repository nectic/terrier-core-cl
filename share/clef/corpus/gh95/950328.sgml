The heart-throb of the
super-group Blur makessome surprising
statements, and BRIAN McIVER writes them down
SPEAKING recently about the characters written about on Blur's
multi-platinum album Parklife, singer/songwriter and national
heart-throb Damon Albarn made the startling confession: ''I am a bored
housewife!''
Albarn was talking about his hit single, End of a Century. ''That song
in particular is a lament for bored housewives. I'm a bored housewife on
occasion . . . that's why I like the Carpenters and things like that. I
always feel like I'm that sort of person.''
However, Albarn does not think of that as freakish or unusual,
especially to write and sing about.
''Lots of people write about drugged-up housewives. Mike Leigh (the
director of Naked and Life Is Sweet etc) has one in every film. They're
one of the stock characters of the British artistic genre. And I like
all of those.
''I like introducing them. It's like Shakespeare, or kabuki in Japan
-- they always have these characters who play certain roles and I like
that, you know. It's just like a tradition and I'd like to think my
songwriting was part of a British tradition.''
However artistic or theatrical the music of Blur may be, it is
certainly in the great tradition of British pop music, which includes
the Small Faces, the Kinks, and the Beatles, among others. Their
incredible writing success has led many to proclaim them pop geniuses.
This is something the band don't like to talk much about. They claim
writing great pop tunes isn't hard. Damon Albarn explains:
''I think there are a few basic rules -- play loud guitars, good
tunes, and three chords, then turn it up. Just add some big words and
little words.''
However easily the pop songs come to Blur, their success was not an
overnight one. They may currently be the most successful band in
Britain, with platinum records, hit singles and Brits awards aplenty,
but up until last year they were just another little pop group, not
doing much. Their previous albums, Leisure and Modern Life Is Rubbish,
were only moderately well received, but they did display the potential
for greater things.
However, everything changed when they relased Parklife, their
spectacular third album, which spawned four top 20 hits -- Girls &amp; Boys,
To the End, Parklife, and the afore-mentioned End of a Century.
There was some controversy over the album cover, a scene from a
greyhound race, one of the lads' favourite pastimes. Damon Albarn
explains:
''A lot has been made of the image on the front of Parklife -- two
rather aggressive-looking greyhounds in mid-race. That actually was a
detail from the William Hill shopfronts, which is a whole series of
sports photos.
''I wanted to have the whole thing on the cover but it just wasn't a
strong enough image so we homed in on the dogs.''
However, the album is not dedicated to sports. ''The betting-shop
picture was more an inspiration from Martin Amis's book London Fields
and the vulgar character of Keith Tanner. Betting was one of his
vices.''
Parklife is one of the best rock-pop releases of the decade, and such
success always attracts the knockers. One of the criticisms levelled
against them is that they are standing on the shoulders of giants and
ripping off their musical pop peers.
Damon Albarn coolly replies: ''I think we choose the best bits from
all the genres of music.''
To the other main complaint -- that they are just middle-class boys
looking down on the working classes -- he says: ''We are! Although not
in an elitist way, and also the characters (in the songs) aren't, you
know, all bloody working class. The majority of them are all the worst
things I hate about middle-class people.
''The main references to working-class people is the image on the
front of Parklife, and in the song Parklife.''
Parklife was one of the most successful singles, and became an anthem
of the past year with Phil Daniel's legendary cockney commentary and its
catchy guitar riff as loathed as it was loved.
All together now . . . Duh Duhduh Duduh Duduh Duduh-duh . . .
Parklife!
PS: Many thanks to BBC Radio 4 for sending me a tape of Blur's recent
visit back to their old school for the Kaleidoscope programme. That's
where the quotes come from.

JANE sat looking out of the window. It was a dismal day and the sky
was grey. She turned her attention to the clock and gazed at the moving
second hand . . .
''Jane, please explain what I was talking about,'' said Mrs Magregor,
her teacher.
''Er . . . umm . . . you were talking about the . . . er, no . . .
that is you, well I am not sure, Mrs Magregor.''
''There you are. You weren't listening!'' said the teacher
triumphantly. ''I was explaining to the rest of the class how to do long
multiplication.''
Jane was given extra maths for homework and, at break, her best
friend, Katie, asked her: ''What were you thinking about?''
''About crazes. I thought I could start a new one. I'm getting a bit
sick of the yo-yo craze.''
''Me too,'' said Katie. ''Anyway, what would the craze be?''
''Well I haven't quite thought of that yet!'' replied Jane, a little
uneasily.
''What have lots of people got that we have as well? They must be easy
to bring to school,'' said Katie.
''I know,'' said Jane. ''Pogo sticks!''
''Superb, first class, great,'' said Katie. ''Most people have them
and they are convenient enough,'' she continued.
''Well, we'll both bring ours tomorrow and don't you dare forget,''
said Jane.
''Same to you,'' said Katie.
The bell rang. Jane and Katie ran indoors together, grinning as they
went.
That afternoon a lot of notes were passed round, addressed either to
Katie or Jane. They were more plots about the new craze.
The next morning Jane, Katie, Alex, Miranda, Anne, Emma, Mary, Alice,
Helen, Naomi, Sarah, Stephanie and Harriet brought in pogo sticks.
The seven girls who did not have them got plenty of go's. Mary taught
Harriet, Katie and Anne how to do it one-handed. Everyone else had a
competition to see who could do the most bounces.
When the bell rang, everyone was disappointed and it seemed as if the
break had only lasted a few seconds.
The next day Joanna arrived with a pogo stick. She was spoilt and,
after her reports about how all the girls had them but she didn't, her
father had bought her one. But Joanna was fat and lazy and didn't really
try to bounce properly. Of course, when she got home she boasted that
she had been the best and her parents believed her.
It was two weeks later when the trouble began. It was all Joanna's
fault.
She went up to Miss Gregson to show off how she could bounce on her
pogo stick. She took her foot off the stick, then her hand, then . . .
WHAM! Her foot slipped and she fell and, banging her chin on the top of
the stick and landing heavily on her right arm. She began to scream and
kick her fat little legs in the air.
Miss Gregson sent Harriet to ring for an ambulance. Everyone pitied
poor Joanna. Later it was heard that she had a small break in her arm
but nothing too serious.
The next day Miss Gregson was taking assembly. ''That's odd,'' said
Mary to Katie.
''I think I know what it's about,'' replied Katie, looking grim.
They said a prayer as usual, then Miss Gregson cleared her throat.
''Girls, you may or may not know that yesterday Joanna Stubson fell off
her pogo stick. The result was that she broke her arm.
''Now pogo sticks are popular in Primary Five. Well, I have made a
list of all the girls who have them and I would like you all to come to
my classroom at 2.30 and give them to me. If you are dishonest and do
not give them, I am afraid that I will have to send a note to your
parents.''
The thought of this was so terrible that at 2.30 a crowd of girls were
waiting outside Miss Gregson's room. She took the sticks and put them in
the staff-room where nobody dared to go in to retrieve a confiscated
item of any sort.
The funniest thing that ever happened to Primary Five happened in two
weeks. It was now getting cold. Joanna was back with a plaster cast and
nobody had got their pogo sticks back. One day, in the middle of break
time, Jane had an idea.
When she had been in Primary Three, when it was cold, she used to look
into the staff-room window. When she looked at the cosy staff room it
would give her a lovely warm feeling. She decided to do it again. But
then Mary came up to her, giggling.
''Come and see this,'' she cried, and Katie, Harriet and a girl called
Catriona came as well. Mary led them up to the staff room window and
there were all the primary teachers and the headmistress playing on pogo
sticks!
The headmistress was bouncing really high and she bounced over Miss
Gregson's newspaper. Miss Gregson hadn't learned to get on, and she kept
falling over.
Mrs Grey was doing it one-handed. The bell rang. All the teachers put
down the pogo sticks. They smiled at each other and Mrs Grey winked.
When the teachers got back to their classrooms they were immediately
accused by the giggling children. The teachers laughed too.
''Well, I think we should have our pogo sticks back now,'' laughed
Alex.
Mrs Magregor went to the staff room and fetched all the sticks.
''Quite good fun, really,'' she said.
''Everyone will be pogo-sticking now,'' said Katie. And she was right.
''And if I hadn't broken my arm it never would have happened,''
boasted Joanna. But everyone knew it was because of Jane that it
happened.

Super-heroes can only enjoy boom time if heroism itself seems
relevant. Conversely, one might say super-heroes are required as
escapism at times of adversity.
I WONDER, gentle reader, how you would respond if I told you that I
read comics. I bet some of you would glance over your shoulder then
furtively reassure me that, yes, you too are still a member of the Beano
Fan Club. At this point I would give you a good hard slap across the
face, because I'm talking about real comics, or more accurately, comic
books. The sort of comics that have been around for 57 years, that were
born in a time of conflict between hope and despair: Super-heroics!
''How sad. How adolescent. Super-heroes? Get a life!'' But wait, hold
up a minute, true believers. Love them or loathe them you are sitting in
the middle of the vanguard of a comics-related media explosion that is
set to dominate TV and cinema for the rest of the decade. Perhaps you
haven't noticed, but Batman (sixties style), Superman (sassy soap with
Lois and Clark), the X-Men (Marvel made mutant mayhem), and the Tick
(super spoof) have been cavorting across our screens on a weekly basis.
Recent cinema smash The Mask was lifted straight out of the pages of
Dark Horse comics, as was the somewhat less successful The Shadow.
This is just the beginning. A whole plethora of big-budget
reinterpretations of comicdom's classics are about to flood the market.
Tim Burton is set to unleash his third Gotham City-based feature Batman
Forever while Sylvester Stallone will soon be rocking cinemas as rough
justice incarnate in Judge Dredd.
In order to balance things chromosomally, expect Catwoman and Tank
Girl movies to follow. Back in the world of the small screen we have
animated escapades aplenty with such series as Phantom 2040, Jim Lee's
WildC.A.T.S., and Marvel Action Hour featuring Iron Man and the
Fantastic Four. And then there's Spiderman . . . A Radio 1 FM serial is
on the air right now, the all-new cartoon show will be upon us soon and
Spidey's getting the Hollywood treatment courtesy of Terminator and True
Lies director Jim Cameron. Pulsating profits, Batman, we haven't even
mentioned merchandising yet.
At the same time as sci-fi is enjoying renewed popularity, comic books
are steadily entering public consciousness through more and more
mass-media adaptations. But these storylines have been lying around on
the printed page for 20, 30, even 50 years. Why do people want them so
badly now?
The original rise of the super-heroes, an era aficionados call the
Golden Age, began in 1938 with the creation of Superman, the namesake of
every super-hero thereafter. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's character
was supposed to be different from the standard gun-slingers, gumshoes,
and jungle men who populated America's dime novels. He was virtuous,
almost godlike, and an alien.
By contrast Batman, a dark and vengeful man without extraordinary
abilities, sprang from the mind of Bob Kane a year later. Both
archetypal characters appeared in Detective Comics. Meanwhile, over at
Timely Comics (later Marvel) the likes of Bill Everett and the late,
great Jack Kirby were introducing two angry young men: the Human Torch
and Namor the Sub-Mariner.
These talented artists then began to set about providing their dynamic
heroes with appropriately dastardly villains. History came up with them
instead. Germany invaded Poland. Comics wrapped in covers showing
twisted Nazi scientists or grotesquely-caricatured Japanese being
pummelled by Captain America and Co sold well in those days of intense
patriotism. But, thankfully, the war didn't last. The market changed,
and the publishers went back to the old standbys of humour, romance,
westerns, and horror.
B-Movie cinema played on the fears of post-war America during the
early fifties, and comics did too. Most (in)famous of all were those
published by EC. These lurid, bloodsoaked tales were to inspire
countless novelists and film makers, but brought comic books themselves
into crisis. In 1954 Frederic Wertham MD, a cross between Mary
Whitehouse and Victor Von Frankenstein, published Seduction of the
Innocent. Dr Wertham proposed that every comic he had ever read, from
Tales from the Crypt through Justice League to Millie the Model,
contained material of a nature that could corrupt the minds of children
and lead to juvenile crime. The furore caused by the book culminated in
a Senate hearing, which in turn resulted in the creation of the Comics
Code Authority. All material intended for publication had to pass
through the hands of the censors, and comics could not be sold without
the CCA symbol on the cover.
Today, the code is pretty much obsolete, but at the time of its
inception it crippled both artists and writers. A new angle had to be
found, and fast.
With so many genres rendered untouchable, super-heroes again became
the staple material of the comic book. However, with violence and shock
tactics at a minimum, these new goodies had to be brainier than they
were brawny. Super-heroes were reborn as angst-ridden teenagers or
troubled misfits. Characterisation, humanisation, and intricate plot
took priority, and the sixties heralded the start of a Silver Age. At
the spearhead of this renaissance were Marvel, and Marvel was led by
Stan Lee.
When asked to look back, Lee once surmised that the reason the public
were once again ready to read about Daredevil or the Hulk was because
they saw heroes in their everyday lives. With men on the moon, and John
F Kennedy in the White House, Americans seemed to be willing to dally in
the realm of the fantastic.
If this is true then super-heroes can only enjoy boom time if heroism
itself seems relevant. Conversely, one might say super-heroes are
required as escapism at times of adversity. The Golden Age saw Europe
being torn apart by Nazism. The Silver Age took place while bombs fell
over Vietnam . . . so, we're back with optimism and pessimism, love and
hate.
If this is a ''platinum'' age, then does it reflect peace in Northern
Ireland and the end of apartheid? Or is it necessary in a world where
our leaders seem to become less worthy of our admiration with each new
scandal? I leave you with this thought: next time you see me shuffling
toward the top end of Buchanan Street for my fortnightly fix of crazed
costumed combatants remember that this is not some sad fanboy you are
looking at.
No. I and others like me are wrestling with the fundamentals of modern
human existence. Politics. Sociology. Media. Whether or not Doctor Doom
is dead. 'Nuff said.

ONE of the most admired exhibits at the YES Conference was a luxury
garden bench created and marketed by Eden, the company set up by the
Achievers of St Andrew's Academy in Paisley. Indeed, it has already won
a product competition at the Renfrewshire Trade Fair held last month in
Glasgow's Central station.
The company secretary, Anthony Cunningham, a fifth-year pupil who is
interested in a career in architecture, said: ''We began by discussing
the idea with our teachers, and decided that we wanted our product to be
a prototype for craft enterprise. There were 17 of us at the start --
now we're down to 10. We drew up a short list of possible projects, and
the majority vote was for garden benches.
''Dykebar Garden Centre is across the road from the school, so we went
over there and looked at the components and the cost. We also satisfied
ourselves that there was a genuine summer market for the benches. We
were pleased that the garden centre was very supportive.
''We had three designers in the company. Our product manager looked at
the designs that were submitted, and worked out exact measurements. We
could offer a range of craft skills, so the actual construction wasn't
going to be a problem.
''We were lucky to obtain the wood for nothing from a firm which had
some but didn't need it. We collected it and set about building the
first bench.
''By this time we had been to the staffroom and asked teachers what
price they would be prepared to pay for garden benches and what kind of
finish they would prefer. That was incorporated into our plans, and from
there it was a matter of getting on with the manufacturing side.
''We have now constructed 15 standard benches, costing #75 each, and
two executive models which are priced at #150. They have been selling
well, mainly to teachers and parents.
''It was great for us to win the product competition at Central
station. We set up a garden, including benches, under the big clock in
the main concourse. As part of our marketing approach we wore full
Highland gear, which we had borrowed. Our prize was a trip to this
conference.
''Now we are starting to liquidate our company, which takes time. We
are making arrangements to pay corporation tax and YES company taxes.
When that is done, the profits that are left will be split among us as
our wages.
''Even if I don't finish up as an entrepreneur, I still consider it
well worth the effort. We've gained a fair insight into the world of
commerce. We've had great support from our business advisers and link
teachers. We've learned a lot about the roles of managing director,
secretary, product manager, and so on. We've come to appreciate the
importance of teamwork and the whole financial aspect of running a
business. It's been a really valuable experience.''

THERE are few students today who are not having to pay at least some
of their way through university and college. The part-time or vacational
job is often vital to their continuing education.
It is not always easy to find such work but two recent schemes
initiated by the Glasgow University's Jobshop have identified potential
markets for student skills and have set about addressing them.
With the Highers and Standard Grade examinations a few weeks away, the
Jobshop has compiled a register of students from every faculty of the
university, who are available to undertake paid tuition work in and
around Glasgow.
Schools have already been notified and information is also available
through Glasgow public libraries, and parents can make direct contact by
phoning the University of Glasgow Jobshop at tel: 0141 339 8541.
In another venture, the Jobshop has approached employers, offering
them free advertising on campus for part-time and vacational placements,
giving them the opportunity to reach over 15,000 students with a variety
of skills and talents.
Employers can also contact Jobshop at the above telephone number.

DICK LOUDEN
discovers how
entrepreneurism
starts in the
classroom
''BE proud to have an entrepreneurial spirit,'' TV personality Kirsty
Wark told pupil delegates to the 8th annual conference of Young
Enterprise Scotland (YES) at the Hospitality Inn in Glasgow. ''In my
early days in radio a producer said to us, 'I want Brezhnev on the
programme. Go out and get him. Dig, dig, dig.' It would have taken a bit
of digging -- he had been dead five years. Things don't always work out,
but the spirit of enterprise is well worth cultivating.''
The objective of YES is to interest young people in thinking seriously
about a career as an entrepreneur. There are YES companies in schools
all over Scotland, and 114 of them took part in the national conference.
Nearly 250 Achievers -- the name given to senior pupils involved in
YES companies -- and 150 business advisers and link teachers came
together from areas as far apart as Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney and
Shetland to exchange experiences, debate future approaches, and listen
enthralled to keynote speeches by Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of
Scottish Enterprise, and the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who revealed
that he had once figured on a short leet of two with Roger Moore for the
role of James Bond.
Owen McGhee, chief executive of YES, explained that ''the concept of
YES, and its theme 'learning by doing', is attracting wider audiences
each year as more schools realise how participation can boost personal
skills development in a practical and exciting way.''
The Achievers, who during this session have been operating outwith
classroom time to turn a business into a profitable trading account,
were given further stimulus to consider an entrepreneurial career by
three people who know exactly what the term means.
Alan Devereux (former chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board, who now
chairs Quality Foundation Scotland): ''In business and in life
generally, the best ideas are simple -- the Lord's Prayer has only 54
words. Keep the acronym VEG in your minds. Values -- knowing right from
wrong, loyalty and integrity, pride in achievement. Excellence -- get it
right every time, go for quality, do it as well as thinking it. Goals --
where are you trying to go? Are your goals realistic? Take it one step
at a time, but go straight towards your goal.''
Marlyn Orcharton (who, while in dental practice, became co-founder of
Denplan, the dental insurance scheme, and now runs Kite Consultants,
which advises small and medium-sized companies on quality assurance):
''Life is about choices. There is no right or wrong choice. Make up your
mind and get on with it. If you're happy you'll be successful. An
entrepreneur never has regrets. I hate to hear somebody saying, 'If only
I'd gone to university'. That's just an excuse -- there's the Open
University.
''In 1986 I realised something was wrong with the system of dentistry.
Patients were often confused over pricing policies and dentists were not
being paid to keep mouths healthy. That's how Denplan arose. Patients
paid so much per month -- they knew what their outlay was going to be
and dentists knew where their income was coming from. It's a simple
idea.
''I received an offer to sell my shares in Denplan. They would be
worth #15m now but I have no regrets. I'm happy running Kite because
we've taken people off the unemployment list. My advice is -- learn to
make educated decisions quickly.''
Frank McKenzie (aged 26, who founded Classic Stained Glass Designers,
with outlets in Linn Park, Glasgow, and in Milngavie): ''Craft and
design were my favourite school subjects. I joined a youth training
scheme to train in the construction industry and gained all the Scotvec
modules.
''Self-employment had long appealed to me. At the age of 22 I got
assistance free of charge to develop a business plan. To qualify I had
to make myself unemployed for six weeks. I also took more Scotvec
modules in finance, health and safety, sales and marketing.
''I explored the market -- this is essential -- and studied the price
lists of competitors. I decided that my base should be in Glasgow. I
obtained grants totalling #3000 from sources like the Prince's Trust and
Castlemilk Economic Development Agency. The unit in Linn Park came up
and I advertised in the local press and through leaflets.
''I opened in April, 1993, and received my first order by 9.15am. I've
never looked back and now have 15 staff and two vehicles. I have
expanded our product base and want to open more outlets.''
Kirsty Wark, who has displayed successful entrepreneurship in the
production company she set up with her husband, says that ''TV may look
glamorous but it's hard graft. You must be ready to work hard and take a
risk. More people are now prepared to do that. There is still a pressure
in society to be employed, but there is a growing entrepreneurial spirit
around and things are moving.''

''I DON'T think about hurting anybody or getting hurt when I'm in the
ring,'' says Willie Limond. ''If I'm winning easily, I tend to hold back
a bit.'' Still only 16, Willie, a fifth-year pupil at Garthamlock
Secondary in Glasgow, has already been Scottish and Western District
flyweight boxing champion at his age group for the past three years and
was silver medallist in the UK Golden Gloves tournament. ''I've been
boxing since I was eight. It's good fun. I liked watching it on TV and
asked my dad to take me along to training. All the same, I don't think
I'd like to become a pro -- I want to be a joiner.''
Willie belongs to Dennistoun Amateur Boxing Club in Glasgow, which
normally takes youngsters from the age of eight. About 25 boys aged
under 16 train from 5pm to 7pm, then a similar number of seniors take
their place.
Their trainers are John McNair and Johnny Mallon, Scottish regional
coaches who have been in the boxing game for more than 40 years, and
James Cunningham, who coaches the younger boys. ''There are no dangers
in amateur boxing,'' claims John McNair. ''The referee will always stop
the fight. In any case, it has to be stopped after the second
knockdown.''
''The social side of boxing is important,'' says Johnny Mallon. ''It
keeps these lads off the streets. Some of the mums come along and thank
us. The boys also get the chance to travel widely to tournaments,
including trips abroad.''
Barry Connell, in fourth year at St Mungo's Academy, has only been
boxing for a couple of years but has already won the Scottish and
Western District welterweight titles twice.
''I tried it because pals told me about it,'' he explains. ''I like
it, but the last thing I want to do is to hurt anybody. I knocked a lad
out in my last fight, but I knew he was going to be OK.
''I've been hurt myself once. It was against a boy who had boxed 72
times against my six. I didn't quite go down, but I felt funny, my legs
went weak and I had a moment of blackness. But I want to go the whole
way and become a professional.''
Nine-year-old James Traynor of St Anne's Primary packs quite a punch
in his five-stone frame. He has been boxing since he was six. He was
admitted to the club early because he lives next door to one of the
coaches. ''I want to win trophies,'' he says. ''I don't want to damage
opponents but I want to knock them out.''
The youngsters ran, jogged, exercised, skipped, and sparred. To them
it was clearly an enjoyable social activity, a positive dimension in
their lives. ''We even have a lad who travels here from Ardrossan,''
says John McNair. ''This is a healthy sport. I've never seen a serious
injury in 40 years -- and you won't meet finer people anywhere.''

THOUSANDS of families throughout Britain are already familiar with the
smiling face of Scottish Friendly. For generations the society's clients
have received regular calls from agents who have collected policy
premiums and delivered financial services to their doorsteps.
And the relationship has brought its customers good returns on their
money over a range of life, pensions, and investment products. In fact
Scottish Friendly, Scotland's leading friendly society, is rated among
the top 10 performers over the 10 years to October last year (source:
Money Management) for with-profits performance for endownment savings
plans.
And now, thanks to a massive and on-going investment programme, the
firm, which has funds under management of #130m and over 350,000
policy-holders, is anxious to spread the word.
To that end, it has set up a sophisticated direct marketing division,
a strategy which last year helped Scottish Friendly Assurance Society
increase its sales by 22% to #2.2m.
''Our move to direct marketing is part of a general and fairly rapid
change in the society itself,'' said Bob Thomson, chief executive.
''We were considered to be old and conservative and, although we don't
wish to portray an image of being new and risky, we have a new and much
more aggressive approach to marketing in general. And for good reason.
Because if you look at the proceeds from our policies at the end of,
let's say, 10 years, we know we are currently paying out more in sum
assured and bonuses for a given premium than many of the big life
companies in the country.
''Although past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future,
we are quite proud of that performance and we want to get our message
across to as many people as possible.''
Marketing manager Harry Gibb said the company now had two distinct
sale distribution channels -- its 40-strong sales force throughout the
UK (plus about 150 agents who monitor their customers' needs and refer
potential business to the sales team); and direct marketing.
''While it is still in its infancy, direct marketing is already
accounting for about half our total sales. We are now reaching people
who in the past we wouldn't have reached and we have plans to push that
further with new products specifically designed to meet our customers'
needs.''
The ambitious and forward-looking approach has been made possible by
the society's recent move to prestigious new headquarters at 16
Blythswood Square, Glasgow, which were opened officially last Wednesday.
Unlike its previous premises at 200 Bath Street, which the company
occupied for 87 years, the Blythswood Square development provides a
state of the art working environment appropriate for a leading financial
institution.
In fact the change of address and the direct marketing drive come at
an exciting time for Scottish Friendly Assurance Society, which changed
its name -- it was founded in 1862 as the City of Glasgow Friendly
Society -- and its corporate identity in 1992.
On top of that the society took advantage last year of recent
legislation (the Friendly Societies Act 1992) to become
''incorporated''. This enables the society to offer a wider range of
financial products including, unit trusts and Personal Equity Plans
(PEPs) to customers and to offer investment fund managment services to
pension funds.
These new services will enhance the society's product portfolio of
life assurance, pensions, investments, mortgage advice, and, very
importantly, tax-free savings plans unique to friendly societies.
Although thousands of astute investors have held tax-free savings
policies with Scottish Friendly for some time, the policies' benefits
will appeal to a wider audience as a result of the last Budget when the
Government increased the amount people could pay in premiums.
The tax-free element of the policies are currently restricted to #18
per month but the relaxation means wise investors who want to minimise
the tax they pay will be able to save up to #25 per month tax-free.
''The increased investment levels are another positive step by the
Government to encourage existing and future friendly society members to
make provision for their future,'' said Harry Gibb.
''This means the first #25 of whatever someone is paying into an
insurance policy will go into a fund that will not be taxed -- and
that's the difference between friendly societies and life companies.
Friendly societies can offer policies which are tax exempt, your money
is invested tax free and the payout is also tax free.
''It's a product aimed at all regular savers, whereas most of the
other tax-exempt products, like Tessas, PEPs etc, are geared to the
upper end of the market-place.
''Twenty-five pounds a month is very affordable, you can invest any
amount up to #25 so it's very flexible. It provides an opportunity for
people who can't afford to save much to invest tax free.''
Scottish Friendly offers two tax-exempt plans, the Scottish Bond and
the Child Bond, the latter designed for parents and grandparents wishing
to save a regular, affordable amount for their children or
grandchildren.
Said Mr Gibb: ''We have found when we advertise with inserts in
newspapers like The Herald that we have had encouraging results.
''At the upper end of the market, people with more disposable income
are looking for tax-free savings and can identify with the product. They
are more aware of the need and the benefit of investing tax free.
''Tax-exempt savings plans are a product which appeals across all
market segments.''
Scottish Friendly's success has not happened overnight, however, and
is built on a long and solid investment track record. Its investments
are managed in-house on a cost-effective basis by a well-established and
experienced team led by Investment Manager Tony Bramley.
''We are committed to providing good, consistent investment
performance for our policyholders. We do not believe good performance
will generally result from a passive investment strategy in the volatile
market conditions of the 1990s so our team is always active.
''Modern computer-driven systems are used to track share prices and
also to ensure efficient investment administration and accounting.
''Performance targets have been set for quoted stocks to ensure the
society is among the best-performing life assurance funds.
''Performance is measured quarterly and past and present performance
results are very satisfactory.
''The society's portfolio is principally made up of holdings in
well-managed, high-quality UK companies and this quality is maintained
by a continuous policy of switching to reflect current trends.''
Recent changes in the law mean friendly societies have to appoint
boards of management, and in this respect Scottish Friendly is ahead of
the pack. The society has been run by a board, which gives better
control of the organisation and ensures it is run on strong business
lines, since its inception.
So everything is now in place to ensure Scottish Friendly Assurance
and its present and future customers enjoy a long and rewarding
relationship.

PERHAPS Albert nipped out to the shops for some Golden Virginia and a
packet of Rizla while Vicky went out and scored. For Queen Victoria was
fond of a joint. Strictly for medicinal purposes, of course.
But Queen Victoria's use of cannabis would not make her stand far from
the crowd in many Scottish high schools. A recent survey shows that 15%
of Scottish teenagers aged between 13 and 16 have tried cannabis. Of
this figure, one in six use it at least once a month.
This statistic is fairly alarming when you consider that it implies
that 15% of Scottish 13 to 16 year olds are criminals. Cannabis is a
class B drug with maximum penalties of five years in prison for
possession and life for dealing. Between 1975 and 1985 there were 22,374
custodial sentences for cannabis offences -- enough to bring most people
down from their high rather sharpish.
However, it would be wrong to suggest that cannabis offenders are
thrown in jail with gay abandon. How the law works in practice is
difficult to assess, but it is generally perceived that those caught
with only a small amount of cannabis will receive a caution, or a small
fine at most.
The effects of using cannabis are well documented: it promotes
feelings of relaxation, makes people more talkative and giggly, and
induces hunger -- commonly known as the munchies. In the short term
cannabis makes concentration and quick reactions difficult, while in the
long term there is a possibility of lung damage if it is smoked,
especially with tobacco.
As far as addition is concerned, there is evidence that cannabis, on
prolonged use, can become psychologically addictive. However, there is
no evidence to suggest that cannabis is in any way physically addictive.
In 1968 the renowned social scientist, Baroness Wootton, produced the
Wootton Report on cannabis which, after a detailed examination of the
evidence, suggested that penalties for small-scale possession should be
reduced. Although the report recommended against legalisation, it met
with an extremely hostile reception and James Callaghan, then Home
Secretary, ignored her findings. The atmosphere surrounding the report
at the time is much the same as that which surrounds the debate today.
It is almost impossible to present an objective look at the legislation
of cannabis without becoming embroiled in a slanging match between
libertarians and authoritarians.
Those who advocate reformation of the law as it currently stands --
including the Liberal Democrats and Labour MP Tony Banks, who support a
royal commission on the subject -- generally state that there is little,
if any, health risk from cannabis.
Available evidence would suggest this is true: numerous working
parties worldwide report that, in moderate doses, cannabis has no
harmful effects. Of course the obvious question is: What exactly is
moderate?
The pro-reformers also argue that cannabis is less harmful than other,
already legal, recreational drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. The
counter argument used here is that cannabis would only add to society's
problems with alcohol and tobacco.
A particularly persuasive argument offered by the pro-reform lobby is
that a limited decrease in penalties for cannabis offences would not
lead to a significant rise in the level of use. This argument is borne
out in America, where many states have abolished penalties for the
possession of relatively small amounts of cannabis. Reviews of the law
changes in these states have shown that cannabis consumption appears
largely unaffected.
The medical benefits of cannabis must also be taken into
consideration. As recently as February a team of European scientists
discovered that there is a receptor in the brain and a ''bliss
molecule'' specifically triggered by tetrahydrocannabinol, the main
psychoactive component of the drug -- ie the bit that gets you stoned.
Now God may be a fairly liberal sort of chap but, the researchers
argue, it is highly unlikely that he is going to place a receptor in our
brain just to get us stoned from a plant that occurs in only a few parts
of the world. It is possible that cannabis has significant medicinal
properties.
Cannabis is already used abroad to stimulate appetite in Aids and
cancer patients because AZT and chemotherapy suppress hunger. In Britain
cannabis is used illegally by sufferers of multiple sclerosis to relieve
their pain. It is only since 1971 that cannabis has become available on
prescription and more than 70% of hospital doctors support the
availability of cannabis on prescription.
Those who adopt a more authoritarian stance generally assert that
cannabis is indicative of a permissive society, a symbol of
anti-establishment values. This was certainly the case as the time of
the Wootton Report.
This may be true to some extent, but it does rely on the assumption
that cannabis users are all either ageing revolutionaries or part of the
dispossessed generation X. In fact, most reports indicate that cannabis
users cover a very broad spectrum of society.
A second argument offered is that legalising cannabis will give out a
''soft on drugs'' message from the Government and this would, in turn,
encourage people to try more dangerous drugs. This is convincing in that
there will always be a certain rebelliousness associated with drugs.
However, it would only be absolutely true if the public were less able
to discriminate between soft and hard drugs than they are today.
One of the classic arguments against legalisation is that cannabis
leads to harder drugs like heroin. The available evidence suggests that
a person who has used cannabis is statistically more likely to use other
drugs than one who has not.
However, the vast majority of cannabis users do not progress to harder
drugs and escalation from cannabis to these drugs is probably no more
likely than escalation from moderate drinking to alcoholism.
The most pertinent constraint to cannabis's legalisation is that
Britain is a signatory to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs and any break from the convention may be regarded as sending the
wrong signals to drug dealers, making Britain the world cannabis
distribution centre.
The authoritarian arguments have fallen on receptive ears at the Home
Office, where Home Secretary Michael Howard has recently increased
penalties for cannabis offences. No doubt the libertarians will argue
that to Mr Howard media image is more important than scientific reports.

Four senior pupils -- Andrea Raeside, Judith Stewart, Eileen Black,
and Louise Elliot -- and a member of staff from Grange Academy in
Kilmarnock were invited to attend a forum for a multicultural Europe in
Luxembourg last November. The invitation came from the Lycee Classique
D'Echternach, a Luxembourg secondary school with which Grange already
had links. As well as attending the conference the four pupils were able
to do some sightseeing and to attend classes in the lycee. Here are
their reflections on their experiences.
IREALLY enjoyed myself in Luxembourg, writes LOUISE ELLIOT. My host
family were very kind and made me feel welcome and I was really looking
forward to the rally on Sunday. On the Sunday morning we were driven to
Diekirch, a small town, where the local school was to host the event for
all the forum participants. I couldn't wait to meet new people from all
over Europe.
When we arrived at the school we were ushered into the games hall and
asked to sit on the floor. The rally organisers, all fairly young,
introduced themselves and then split us up into groups, with each group
having representatives from all the countries taking part. At first I
felt very alone among strangers, but soon we were all trying to get to
know each other using a variety of different languages. It was great
meeting people your own age from many different countries although I did
notice that there were many more girls than boys attending. I got on
particularly well with the girls from Sweden and Portugal.
The rally itself wasn't a complete success, although it was a good
idea to put groups of strangers together with different tasks to
complete, so that everyone had to make an effort to communicate.
Unfortunately most of the visiting ''foreigners'' felt it was the
Luxembourgers, with local knowledge, who did most of the ''treasure
hunting''. The games were fun though.
I found that the conference itself was really interesting but I was
very nervous when I had to read out my group's report back to one of the
plenary sessions. The experience hasn't changed my views on racism, but
I do feel that I'm more open-minded about other people's opinions.
GOING to Luxembourg was a totally new experience for me, and one I was
looking forward to with nervous excitement, writes EILEEN BLACK. I'm not
sure how the others felt, but I was more worried about meeting my host
family than about leaving my own parents behind. I think only one of us
was not in a state of panic. I'm not sure if it was a good or a bad sign
but she remained chatty all the way from Glasgow, while the rest of us
sat in a slightly nervous, almost silent state, and the apprehension
increased the nearer we got to our destination.
None of us could believe just how flat Holland was, or how enormous
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was compared to Glasgow. The same,
unfortunately, could not be said about the size of the KLM City Hopper
that was to take us to Luxembourg. I've never felt so scared in an
aircraft. It was so small and incredibly noisy and I could even see the
propellers from my seat.
When we arrived at Luxembourg I could tell that I wasn't the only one
worried, as we all hung back as long as possible before venturing
through the doors of the arrival hall to meet our new families. We
needn't have worried, because they were all most charming and welcoming.
I attended only the opening and closing plenary sessions of the forum
and sadly missed the workshops. This was because our hosts had requested
that we bring along an ''accomplished'' musician -- and I was it,
complete with my flute. We had been told that a European ''orchestra''
would rehearse during the three days of the conference and perform for
the delegates on the last night. The orchestra turned out to be six
flutes, two recorders, a bassoon, four saxophones, two trumpets, two
clarinets, and a keyboard. However, it did prove that music was a common
language in Europe, although I did feel I missed out in not being able
to participate in the workshops.
HAVING never been abroad without my parents before, the trip to
Luxembourg certainly threw me in at the deep end, writes JUDITH STEWART.
Naturally I was excited about it, but I must be honest and admit that I
felt some trepidation at the thought of living alone with a foreign
family for a week.
This tension came to a head when we landed at Luxembourg Airport. I
think we were all a bit unsure of what to expect. Would the families
like us? Would we like them? Would we be able to understand each other.
This would be real-life French and German, not the classroom variety.
The wait for the luggage seemed to last an eternity but when we
finally met our hosts they were all very friendly and most welcoming.
Fortunately the four host pupils were friendly so we were able to
spend a lot of time together as a group. However, this did not detract
in any way from the feeling of being in a foreign country or take
anything away from the value of our experiences. But going to school at
8am on a Saturday morning was one experience I will not be in a hurry to
repeat.
Even though the school curriculum is different from ours, one thing I
learnt from the Lycee Classique D'Echternach, and also at the conference
itself, was the great similarity among teenagers of different countries.
We all enjoy the same activities; music, dancing, and youth
organisations; and we all rate highly the some sorts of issues, such as
racism and concern for the environment. For me Luxembourg was an
informative and unforgettable experience, through which I have made many
friends and hopefully lifelong acquaintances.
TEENAGERS from 12 different European countries were represented at the
conference, where we discussed the issues of racism, intolerance, and
xenophobia, writes ANDREA RAESIDE. As the two most widely spoken
languages were French and English, any discussion in the plenary
sessions were in those two languages, although thankfully we also had
the services of two excellent professional translators. It was fun
wearing the headphones and listening to simultaneous translation.
After assembling each morning to discuss the issues to be tackled that
day, the 50 or so delegates split up into workshop groups containing a
representative from each country. The supervising teachers were banned
from these workshops because, apparently, in previous years they had
dominated the discussions. Communications within the workshops were
sometimes difficult, particularly due to the speed at which the Irish
and Scottish delegates spoke, but using a mixture of French, German, and
English we came up with some interesting conclusions over the three
days.
It was generally agreed that more action had to be taken to stamp out
racism and intolerance throughout the EU. One group came up with the
interesting viewpoint that, to be totally tolerant, it was necessary to
tolerate and try to understand the reasons behind someone's racist
views. This issue was one of the most heatedly discussed of the whole
conference and certainly had a few people's blood boiling. Due to slight
differences in translating from one language to another, many delegates
had misunderstood and thought that some people were supporting racism
when in fact they were only saying that the causes behind it should be
understood.
By the end of the conference a group of Luxembourgers had produced a
booklet containing the general resolutions of the delegates. These
resolutions were presented in the final plenary session to the
Luxembourg MP responsible for the campaign against racism. After
listening to all our points of view he announced that the resolutions
that we had produced would be presented to each parliament within the
EU. All the delegates from all the countries represented, who long for a
more tolerant society, are eagerly awaiting the response of their own
national Government.

TOMMY Craig's Scotland Under-21 side will be first into action in
Moscow when they play in the Torpedo Stadium this evening, and the
manager believes his side are capable of recording a notable double.
The Scots defeated Russia at Broadwood in November, and that result
has given Craig hope that his players can qualify from their group.
He will rely on old-fashioned methods by asking the team to have a go
from the start, and why not? Craig's squad is littered with strikers who
are in the mood and he also has players capable of manufacturing
chances.
Stephen Crawford, of Raith Rovers, and Barnet's Douglas Freedman could
benefit from the work of Brian McLaughlin, who is preferred to Neil
McCann, even though the Dundee winger turned the game against Greece in
December in Scotland's favour.
Celtic winger McLaughlin, a recent Scottish Premier League Young
Player of the Month, will be making his international debut, and said:
''Everything is going well for me with Celtic and now this.''
After three matches, the young Scots lie second in the Group 3 points
table behind Finland, who beat them in the opening match six months ago,
and are three points in front of Russia, who have played two games.
''The defeat in Finland was annoying because the Finns were the least
efficient of the three sides we have met so far,'' Craig said.
''Okay, we stole a result against Russia, because they were the better
team, but these results prove the best sides don't always triumph and I
believe we can do something in Moscow because we are capable of scoring
away from home.
''This match gives us a real chance to do something in the group and
we must approach it in a positive manner. They will probably expect us
to be cautious at the start, but I'd rather see us go the other way and
attack them from the start. It might unnerve them.''
Craig has made Dundee United's midfield player David Hannah the
captain, although there are more natural captains in the side in
Christain Dailly and Stephen Pressley, who will form a central-defensive
partnership. Team:
Stillie (Aberdeen), Jupp (Fulham), Dailly (Dundee United), Pressley
(Coventry City), Bollan (Rangers), Hannah (Dundee United), Miller
(Rangers), McNamara (Dunfermline), McLaughlin (Celtic), Crawford (Raith
Rovers), Freedman (Barnet).

DAVID BELCHER witnesses the return of a top rocker to his Bellshill
alma mater in a blaze of modesty
'If you're getting some pressure to go to college, you can always do
music as a serious hobby'
IT would not be too unkind to state that Bellshill Academy's roster of
celebrated former pupils is a finite one. There was wee Sheena Orr, who
became pop megastar Sheena Easton. Then there was Greenock Morton's idle
idol, erstwhile Scottish Footballer of the Year Andy Ritchie. And
there's Normal Blake.
Normal Blake? Well, that's what it said on the school's slightly
mistyped official newsletter heralding his return visit to his alma
mater. Norman Blake is who he really is, top normal rock'n'roll bloke
with Teenage Fanclub. Soon to release a brand new album, Grand Prix,
Teenage Fanclub's four-person membership includes two graduates -- one
civil engineer; one town planner -- and a chap who left school in 1983
with no Highers, ie Norman Blake.
''I could show you the marks Norman got, but that wouldn't be fair,''
revealed one of Norman's former maths teachers, Jamie MacLeod, when the
pair came face to face in the classroom once again. What was English
teacher Gordon Lodge's cheery greeting for Norman? ''How's the talented
one in your family . . . your sister?''
And what was it that depute head Andrew Goodwin had said when Norman
began his triumphal tour of Bellshill's corridors and classrooms?
''We'll start off in the new Art Room with Ronnie Smith . . . the new
Art Room used to be the girls' toilets -- you'll remember them?''
Yes, Norman had replied. Later, as he willingly complied with a
barrage of pupils' requests for autographs, Norman probably wasn't
joking when he said that he hadn't put pen to paper so often during the
length of his entire school career. But at least Norman's old teachers
-- history teacher Irvine Sneddon, maths teacher Alan Stangoe -- were
genuinely glad to see him. And a number of sixth-form pupils, as well as
two ex-pupils -- were very happy to ask Norman Blake the following . . .
* Did you enjoy your time at school?
* ''Looking back, I enjoyed it. Real life's much harder when you leave
school. We've been very lucky as a band, in that we've always done what
we wanted to, and we were also lucky in that we accidentally became
linked with Sonic Youth and Nirvana, and their success rubbed off on us,
expecially in the US.
''Over there, our being Scottish was a novelty which worked for us,
too, our ethnicity . . . and for a couple of months when it mattered, we
were hip and really hot. So much so that a lot of major record labels
became involved in a bidding war, and we've been lucky in staying
popular with the industry.
''But to begin with, because we didn't want to justify ourselves to
anyone else, we recorded our first album ourselves, completely at our
own expense. We bought the tape; we booked the studio. Raymond our
guitarist actually had to sell his fridge and his cooker to pay for the
studio-time, and I borrowed #400 from my mum and dad.''
* Did your parents put pressure on you to go to college?
* ''My parents were actually away, working in Portugal, and I was
staying with my gran in her house where we'd rehearse as a band . . .
but my mum and dad were always happy for me to be a musician. And my
gran eventually got used to the noise of us rehearsing. We probably
deafened her. I've noticed that she always has the telly on at full
volume now.
''But if you are getting some pressure to go to college, you can
always do music as a serious hobby. There are people who have jobs and
who are in bands at the same time. In Glasgow, there are the Pastels,
led by Stephen Pastel . . . librarian by day, rock star by night!''
* Are there any people you still idolise?
* ''Not idolise . . . I'd like to meet Paul McCartney. I've respect
for anyone who can write a song, and be honest about what they do, and
not be contrived. We never worry about what critics might say because
we're honest -- we don't think we're brilliant, but we are confident
about what we do . . . we think it's worth attention.
''For instance, an American magazine said that Bandwagonesque was 'the
best album made by white people in the past 20 years' -- which is
ridiculous. We don't take bad press seriously; we don't take good press
seriously.''
* Did you know Kurt Cobain?
* ''We toured with Nirvana, and Kurt had an honesty, a talent --
someone said that Smells Like Teen Spirit is the song for anyone who has
ever come from a small town and felt disenfranchised and disenchanted,
and that's absolutely right. At first when we met him, Kurt wasn't a
drug addict. Later it was tragic that heroin became 'fashionable' and
that Kurt became messed up by it, and by a lot of other things . . . by
a massive success that he hadn't wanted; that led him to become A
Spokesperson For A Generation when he hadn't wanted it. Drugs are bad,
and uncool, and they drove Kurt Cobain to suicide.''
* Have you never wanted to get away from staying in Bellshill?
* ''I'm very happy in Bellshill . . . I'm handy for Safeway, for my
messages. I've actually had places in Glasgow, and then I've been away
touring and I've not been organised enough to keep up with paying the
rent. But my girlfriend's pregnant, and we're going to move out of my
gran's house in Bellshill, which is where I've mostly lived, and go to
live in Glasgow. But I'm not like Prince.''
* How many instruments do you play?
* ''Lots of them a wee bit. Guitar. Basic chords on the piano. I can
play the drums . . . but only for about a minute and a half because I
don't have the stamina. Recently I've been learning more about working a
sound-desk in a studio, setting up levels, working compressors, because
I don't like folk who say they're producers and then they can't work the
desk in the most basic, hands-on way. If ever or whenever Teenage
Fanclub reaches a natural conclusion, I know that I'm always going to be
in the music business, producing or whatever.''
* How do you write songs?
* ''On the guitar, in the house. I try to play every day for two
hours. But the song that became our latest single was actually created
while I was sitting on the train home, with a hangover -- not that I
often have hangovers!
''I'd been in the studio, working on our new LP, and I'd felt so bad
that I'd had to go home, and the idea for the song just came to me.
There's no formula, I wish I had one. I write songs round chords, rather
than riffs, although Raymond and Gerry do the opposite, but we're all
traditional in seeing songs as verse-chorus, verse-chorus.''
* Does your record company put pressure on you to be catchy -- and
does someone like Whigfield, who admits she can't sing, annoy you?
* ''No to both questions, although our British label, Creation, might
be a bit concerned if we went jazz overnight. There's a market for what
Whigfield does, and there's nothing I can do about it. What I don't like
is that a lot of music now is cynical and calculated, an exercise almost
solely in marketing. Being successful and having the right image have
become more important than making music . . . and yes, the Beatles
looked great, but they also had great songs.
''But we have artistic control, and we have our integrity. We have
artistic control over sleeves. We once had a big argument with our
American label, Geffen, about an album sleeve they chose . . . a picture
of a girl with wet hair in a white t-shirt. They were saying this
photograph somehow represented us when we were sure it didn't. Yet
despite the music business's pursuit of success, we will always have our
integrity.
''So if you see me dressed in a chicken-suit in a few years' time,
promoting a record, you'll know it was my decision.''
* You must be loaded -- mustn't you?
* ''Oh aye . . . not. You need to have big hits for that. Because
we're a working band who play live in lots of different places around
the world, it maybe seems like we lead a glamorous, they-must-be-loaded
kind of a life.
''We've been to Australia and America, and I've seen places I would
never have seen without the group . . . and the current album was mixed
in Los Angeles. Not because it was Los Angeles, but because the bloke we
were mixing it with was there working on something else.
''But rooms in this studio cost #1000 a day to hire. So we were in one
room, thinking 'Good grief -- #1000 a day!' . . . and Michael Jackson
was in one room. And he had another room -- at #1000 a day -- which was
full of his toys so he could play with them when he felt like it.''

valuable.

THE advance forces of the ''Tartan Army'' have arrived in Moscow.
Groups of supporters made it to the Russian capital as early as Saturday
for the big game tomorrow.
Others flew in yesterday with still more to follow.
Startled Muscovites saw them in Red Square, queuing at Lenin's tomb,
waving their tartan scarves outside the Kremlin, and seeking out the
Irish bars which are now a part of Moscow nightlife.
The SFA sent a security man ahead of the main group to run checks on
trouble. So far, there seems to have been none.
There was snow in Moscow yesterday morning but by the time the
Scottish team arrived, it had vanished and there is no danger to the
game.
Said a Russian football spokesman: ''Even if the snow had stayed the
game would have gone on because we have undersoil heating at the
stadium.''

THE brouhaha over the terrifying brain injuries suffered by the
American Gerald McClellan in his fight with Nigel Benn has faded away.
But should we let it? There are powerful financial forces at work,
determined to protect professional boxing from a ban. Why should hard
cash dominate the debate?
The Labour Party rejects a ban, claiming that it would drive the sport
underground and that unregulated bouts, where Queensberry rules would
not apply, would prove more dangerous. The reasoning is absurd. If a
sport deserves to be banned, ban it and devise fearsome penalties for
those who break the law.
Amateur boxing -- at school age and above -- should not be banned --
it is scrupulously controlled in a way that would drive the professional
game out of business. Serious injury is almost unknown. If amateur
boxing has a problem it is that it can start some youngsters thinking
about a career on the professional side.
If this sounds like infringing civil liberties and freedom of choice,
so be it. It is an empty argument that boxers know the risks and should
be allowed to take them. There are times when governments should protect
their citizens from themselves for their own good.
What's so special about boxing? Motor racing, parachute jumping, and
horse racing are said to be statistically more dangerous. A recent
American survey rates boxing as only the 29th most unsafe sport. But in
other sports the purpose is not deliberately to inflict physical damage
on your opponents. That's what makes boxing uniquely barbaric.
Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, has the
courage to speak out against his party's policy. He is entitled to do so
-- as an experienced neurosurgeon who, while at the Southern General
Hospital in Glasgow, conducted a special study of head injuries in
boxing.
''This sort of assault cannot continue,'' he says. ''Medical back-up
comes in too late. The purpose of boxing is to inflict brain damage.''
That is a horrifying thought. Boxers actually want to damage each
other. When a boxer is bleeding from an eye injury his opponent
concentrates on opening up the wound further.
At the Benn-McClellan fight there were two doctors, two paramedic
teams, an anaesthetist, and an ambulance standing by, yet they could do
little until it was too late. As McClellan lay there, they placed an
electronic monitor under his skull to measure any build-up of pressure.
But the brain damage could have been inflicted at any time during the
fight -- McClellan may have been bleeding slowly without anyone
realising it. Headgear might reduce the risk of injury on the night but
it does nothing to prevent accumulative brain damage.
The opposite corners face up to one another aggressively. The British
Medical Association has long campaigned against professional boxing on
the grounds of safety and now talks of boxers ''playing roulette with
their brains''. The British Boxing Board of Control accepts that
''boxing is a dangerous sport'' but maintains that ''We do every mortal
thing we can to make it as safe a sport as possible''. With the emphasis
on ''mortal'', of course.
Ironically, Michael Watson -- who sustained similar injuries in a
fight against Chris Eubank -- watched the McClellan fight from the
ringside in a wheelchair. He has made only a partial recovery after four
years of misery and anguish.
Television should now examine its own conscience. Professional boxing
was being counted out on its feet until TV injected big money for live
coverage. It happened with wrestling, whose popularity died away when
the cameras moved on. TV has the power to make it happen again.
However, that does not absolve Government from taking its own action.
Professional boxing is a cruel, vicious sport. In the words of Sam
Galbraith: ''How many more people have to die or be maimed before we
call a halt?''

Last month we put these pages up for grabs as YOUR SPREAD. Meet the
grabbers...
SLEEPER, Echobelly, and Portishead are all, as the T-shirt says, just
''another female-fronted group''. But everyone knows that Sharleen
Spiteri is not the only star of Texas.
Guitarist Ally McErlaine has always shared the limelight with Sharleen
and has been called everything from a ''precocious talent'' to, in the
words of Q magazine, ''one of the coollest guitar individuals around''.
Indeed his guitar solos are a vocal point for much of the band's live
shows as well as the studio work.
A debut Top 10 single, million-selling albums, and success in places
you didn't know existed are all part of being in Texas -- from the
outset one of Glasgow's most successful and widely recognised bands. I
spoke to Ally and asked him where it all started.
''Johnny, our bass player, was in a band called Hipsway and when they
split up he was looking to form a new band when he met up with Sharleen.
We share a manager with Gun and it was they who recommended me. So none
of us knew each other; we weren't like school friends.
''When we recorded Southside we were quite naive; it was our first
time in a studio and all we had were the songs but we just went in, did
it and it took off from there.
''Southside was a pop album. It was kind of bluesy but with real pop
songs. We were really aiming for a cross between the Eurythmics and the
Stones.''
The second album, Mother's Heaven, was well received by the critics
but failed to capture the imagination of the British public.
''Well, we never had a big hit from that album in Britain but we still
sold a million copies worldwide and, with each tour, we were getting
bigger audiences. We had wanted to do something opposite to Southside
and so it became quite a dark album. It was hard to record because the
songs were a bit down and kind of heavy. Mother's Heaven did really well
and sold lots of records so it was a success to us.''
Next up was Rick's Road, which proved to be an even bigger success
than the previous albums. Recorded in a studio near Woodstock, it
managed to capture a more American feel. It provided a few hits,
including So Called Friend, You Owe It All to Me and So in Love with
You. The other album tracks were of much the same quality, with songs
like Winter's End and Hear Me Now rating among Texas's finest moments.
But why did they choose to record in the States?
''The first two albums were recorded in London and we'd been touring
Britain and Europe for so long that we wanted to do something different.
We really wanted to make a traditional live album without samplers or
modern technology. We just wanted to go somewhere cool.
''Paul Fox, the producer, liked to work in America and so we hooked up
with him. He knew the owners of the Bearsville Studios in Woodstock and
he'd produced the Sugarcubes and 10,000 Maniacs there. We were all for
it because of Woodstock's history and it was off the beaten track so
we'd never have gained the chance to go there on tour. It was good fun
but I don't think we'd do it again because you tend to take in your
surroundings and the album was probably too American as a result.''
The following year saw them touring Britain, Europe, and America as
well as South Africa, where they appeared with (South African President)
Nelson Mandela before a TV audience of around 80 million. An American
tour supporting John Mellencamp was cut short following Mellencamp's
heart attack. With so many tours with each recording, does Texas not
feel more of a live band than a studio one?
''We actually made a record before we'd toured. We'd played a few gigs
but the beginning of the band was mostly spent in studios. Studios can
be like hospitals, sort of clinical; it can be fun but other times it
can be really heavy going. When you go on tour it's like getting
released from that, you play your songs once and people react to that.
''We've toured Europe two or three times with every album and did the
same in America with the last one. It's the kind of thing that's really
hard work but it pays off as it builds an audience and they'll come back
and see you again and buy what you put out.
''It is hard work but it's a lot of fun. You get really tired and it's
bad for your health. You find yourself in a town in Germany; you don't
know anybody so you play your gig and afterwards sit in the dressing
room and have a few beers. Then someone'll come and say 'Let's go out'
and that's you for the night. You end up drinking too much. There's
really not much else to do.''
Don't you ever get sick of playing I Don't Want a Lover all the time?
''We don't have strict arrangements to the songs so we tend to jam it
a lot and we never play the same set every night so if there's a song
you get bored playing you drop it and move on to something else. Being
the guitarist means I rarely play the same solos so that keeps it
interesting every night. If it was the same arrangements for every gig
it'd be unbearable.''
It seems as though it was easy for Texas to start up, but just how
difficult is it for other Glasgow bands? ''I think bands from Glasgow
have a certain advantage over bands from, say, Edinburgh because of
Glasgow's good track record for producing groups. There are good clubs
for bands starting up to play and there's a big scene that makes it easy
for them to form.
''I think there is a slight prejudice against Scots bands from the
London-based music press. They prefer London bands because they're more
accessible and go to the same pubs as the journalists. We've never been
a press band. We get some attention but not from NME or anything like
that. They've never really bothered. We just put out our records and do
well enough. In the end if you live by the press, you die by the
press.''
The release of You Owe It All to Me on single was greeted with the
release of a limited edition acoustic CD which featured an excellent
take on the Lennon-McCartney classic Revolution. Would the band ever
consider releasing a cover version as a single?
''Not really, but we've nothing against the idea. If we did a really
good cover version and everyone liked it then we wouldn't object to
putting it out as a single. We do play covers live but when you're
releasing an album that's really your chance to showcase your songs.''
The interview stops for a moment as Ally gets a phone call from an
English friend to wish him a happy Burns night. ''I didn't know it
was,'' he says, returning. Which seems a good time to ask the reason for
Texas's popularity in Scotland and Europe, yet not England?
''I've no idea. It's a really strange one. It's usually pretty hard
for British bands to break Europe unless you're like Phil Collins or
somebody and sell millions of records everywhere. I think it's because
we've toured it so much and really made an effort to break it. In
Britain because of Top of the Pops and the weekly music press, bands
don't seem to last too long as people are always on the lookout for the
next big thing. Few other countries have that kind of media. People just
tend to go and see bands if they like them. They listen to the music
they like and aren't as fashion orientated. Though I still can't
understand why we can play Paris to 10,000 people and only 2000 in
London. We do pretty well in England but we just don't get the press for
it. We've not given up or anything.''
Do you prefer being able to live somewhere where you're not that
famous and can walk down the street?
''We're not a band you'd consider famous. Kylie Minogue is famous
because she's on TV and in magazines all the time and everybody would
recognise her. The only people who'll recognise us are fans of the band
and if someone comes up to you in the street and says 'I saw you at the
gig and liked the record' then that's what you want out of it, really.
It would be a nightmare if you got too famous and everywhere you went
people were looking at you. That'd be the worst.
''We do mix with people in the music industry a lot. I'm really good
friends with Gun, and because we've done well in France we meet people
in the fashion industry too.''
Is this you hanging with the supermodels then?
''I have met a few supermodels, I must admit.''
And what can you tell us about them?
''They're very tall.''
Taller than you?
''Taller than anybody. I met Helena Christiansen recently and she was
really, really intelligent. I didn't think she would be stupid but I
wasn't expecting her to be so sharp. She's probably had a lot of
practice with people who treat her as if she's stupid when she's not.
''There are people I wouldn't want to meet. I've met people whom I've
always really looked up to and if they're not friendly you think 'God,
why did I like them?' I like the idea of still having people that you
look up to. If you've met everybody you lose that sense of wonder. I
never want to meet Bob Dylan. He's one of my idols, and I'm scared he'll
turn round and tell me where to go. I've stood beside him a few times
and had the chance to speak to him but I just thought, no, I don't want
to.''
Why is it that you are as much in focus as Sharleen in the band?
''Well, in most bands the singer is the focal point of the group, like
Mick Jagger, and also sometimes the guitarist is as well, like Keith
Richards, but Texas is a real group and Richard or Eddie or Johnny are
as much a part of the band as Sharleen or I. If they weren't there the
band would lose part of its character. Bands are everything to do with
chemistry. You can get all the top session musicians together and they
can all play amazingly but there's no spirit or soul to it. That's the
really important thing.''
So what music are you into yourself?
''New stuff? Well, I really like Portishead. I like a Glasgow band
called AC Acoustics who've just brought out a couple of singles. They're
going to do really well. Um . . . I like Oasis and Blur and all that. I
think it's good pop music. There's an American singer I like called
Victoria Williams. Paul Fox, the guy who produced Rick's Road, produced
her latest album, Loose. I love the new Edwyn Collins album Gorgeous
George. I like a lot of chart stuff. I listen to a lot of jazz. I really
love Blondie. They're one of my favourite bands, and I love Led
Zeppelin.''
So how long until Texas's next album release?
''It's pencilled in for next January but we may have something out
before then. We might play the T in the Park festival in summer. The
promoters are wanting to make a big thing about it this year, maybe
release a special single for it and stuff and making it a really big
event. But none of that is confirmed yet. Recording comes first,
though.''
On that note the interview comes to a close and I leave Ally perched
on a cushion watching MTV and smoking a fag. Before I exit, though, he
asks me to send him a copy of the article when it is published so as to
determine whether to show it to the rest of the group.
While other bands have burned out from too much fame, too fast, Texas
has kept in the shadows, steadily releasing albums and singles and
gaining fans by touring rather than by press coverage. This, it would
seem, is a recipe for longevity in the business, and it's one other
genuinely talented bands could do well to learn from.

I'm a rock star,
This confession of failure is left ringing in your ears,
My blurred ascent left my ears singing,
The higher you go the colder it gets.
They gave you an image to cling to,
When you wanted more,
I cut off another piece of myself,
They packaged it and sold it to you,
A commodity,
A plastic idol for you to cling to.
Did the echo of the shotgun scare you,
As it rung out the hollowness of everything you look up to,
Stardom,
Money,
Your commercial icons laid bare,
The falseness of all you grapple for and admire,
Nowhere left to climb.
-- Donald Lindsay, sixth year

FRANK Bruno (left), the perennial title-chaser, will be heading for
Glasgow in six weeks time. The likeable pantomime star-cum-heavyweight
boxing title contender last night agreed terms to fight at the
8000-capacity Kelvin Hall Arena on May 13.
This will be the Englishman's first ring appearance since his
well-documented. 65-second Bristol farce in February.
That was when Bruno featured on what was at the time laughably
described as a world heavyweight title eliminator and dismissed the
podgy Puerto Rican no-hoper Rodolfo Martin with a half-hearted pat on
the head.
But his new handler, Frank Warren, having split with former mentor
Mickey Duff in January -- has emphasised that the big man will get a
more severe test in Scotland.
Possible opponents being talked about by joint promoters, Warren and
Katherine Morrison are the highly rated American trio of Larry McDonald,
Tommy Morrison, and Mike Hunter, ranked fifteenth, fourteenth, and
eleventh respectively.
Also pencilled in as a possible main support to Bruno could be the
prospects of Glasgow's unbeaten lightweight hope, Dave Anderson,
challenging tough London title-holder Michael Ayers for the British and
World Boxing Council International championships.
The Glasgow contest would be classed as a warm-up for Bruno before he
challenges the winner of the April 8 show-down between WBC champion
Oliver McCall and former world champion Larry Holmes.

AFTER just one grand prix of the 1995 Formula One season, motor sport
yesterday was plunged, once again, into political ferment.
With Gerhard Berger declared winner of the Brazilian Grand Prix,
following the disqualifications of Benetton's Michael Schumacher and
Williams' David Coulthard, the championship remains wide open.
While Damon Hill was hoping the disciplinary action would stand --
despite the detrimental effect on his Scottish team-mate Coulthard --
speculation was at full throttle over suggestions that drivers,
including Schumacher, were deliberately putting on weight, then dieting
to take advantage of new regulations.
Even though Coulthard would lose his runner-up points, England's Hill
believes it would be good for him if the Sao Paulo disqualifications
were to remain in force. However Benetton, and Hill's own team,
Williams, confirm they will appeal against the disqualifications and
#20,000 fines, made on the grounds that they used illegal fuel.
Hill would rather be 10 points adrift of Berger's Ferrari than
Schumacher's Benetton. ''For me obviously it is not so bad, because I
thought I'd be 10 points down on Michael,'' said Hill.
Coulthard, who will talk to team leaders about the appeal, said: ''I
am naturally disappointed, but until I can speak to the team, I don't
know the position.''
Berger accused Schumacher and Coulthard of breaking the rules. ''I am
very happy about this decision,'' he said. ''I don't feel sorry for
Michael or David, because cheating is cheating. It is not right that
their cars were not within the rules.
''All the cars are about the same level of performance, except those
with Renault motors. They are in a world of their own. I don't know if
that's down to the fuel, but...''
The sport's governing body, the International Automobile Federation,
''fingerprinted'' the fuel from all teams, so they could not use a
higher octane on race day. Samples from the cars used by Schumacher and
Coulthard didn't match those fingerprints.
Speculation over manipulation of drivers' weights arose following
comments by rival team members.
Official statistics show that the 26-year-old Schumacher weighed 69
kilos last season and 71 in 1993. Last Thursday, at Interlagos, he
weighted 77k.
Several other drivers' weights increased markedly -- Berger's from 74k
to 80, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen from 62k to 68.5.
''Yes, I have put on some extra kilos this winter from good training
to build up my muscles. I've turned fat into muscle,'' said Schumacher.
New regulations use the combined weight of the car, plus the weight of
the driver, to establish a total which must be a racing minumum of 595k.
But if a driver were to weigh more at the start of the season than
when actually driving, the difference could be interpreted as an
advantage.
According to a source close to Schumacher, he was weighed unexpectedly
after Sunday's race. His weight, added to that of the car, did not break
the regulations -- dehydration can cost drivers a lot of weight during a
race -- but he was considerably lighter than he had been on Thursday.

Scotland 1 Brazil 0
THE above scoreline sounds like the ravings of a demented patriotic
mind, yet it happened. Almost ten thousand ecstatic supporters witnessed
it at Hampden Park in the under-15 international.
Scotland's goal was scored by Jim Paterson of Blantyre High. The Scots
had become more dominant as the match progressed. John Paul Dow of St
Stephen's High in Port Glasgow was an accomplished linkman, with Jim
Gibson of John Ogilvie High in Hamilton and Andrew Porteous also
impressing. The captain, Keith Brown of Currie High, and Ross Clark of
Lesmahagow High, stood out in central defence, while keeper Paul
Gallacher of St Mirin's High, Paisley, also looked capable of
progressing further.
The match was played in fine spirit and admirably controlled by one of
our most distinguished referees, Jim McCluskey. His yellow card never
threatened to make an appearance.
The Rangers secretary, Campbell Ogilvie, rated the Scots highly,
especially Jim Gibson, an S-form signing for the Ibrox club. ''It was an
excellent overall performance,'' he said. ''They just didn't let the
Brazilians play.''
Councillor Bill Perry, convener of Strathclyde region, was equally
enthusiastic. ''They were brilliant, especially Paul Gallacher,'' he
said. ''It was better than watching professional football.''
In fairness, the Brazilians were affected by the wintry conditions.
Some couldn't speak in the dressing-room at half-time. One substitute,
warming up to come on, could scarcely move his legs.
Still, the Scots tackled with vigour and determination and looked a
compact, organised side, as the Brazilian coach, Toninho Barroso,
acknowledged. ''They were competitive and showed fair skill,'' he said.
''They were a balanced squad. What would worry me is what happens next
to them.''
He was advocating a system under which boys at this high level would
be retained thereafter in national squads. Failing such a system, they
have to start proving themselves all over again.
He applauded the philosophy behind The Herald Seven-a-Sides. ''I find
it amazing that children here still play on full-sized pitches with
full-sized goals,'' he said. ''In Brazil we concentrate on small teams
and parks. That way they learn ball control in tight situations.
''You must inject fun into the game and get rid of the
win-at-all-costs attitude. I am not unhappy that my team lost, because
they learned things. Start working with children early, using qualified
coaches. Seeing your own skills develop is fun in itself.''
He was preaching what he teaches. At Hampden, even in the hostile
conditions, nobody could fail to admire players like left back Henrique,
who used every ball constructively.
The crowd of almost 10,000 was four times the attendance at the
Partick Thistle v Dundee United game that evening. That surely says
something about schools football.
* The final stages of The Herald Seven-a-Sides, due to be played at
Hampden the same evening, were cancelled because of concern over the
state of the pitch. Please see page 16 for details of the new
arrangements.

THE biggest security operation for an international in Dublin will be
mounted for tomorrow's European championship qualifier between the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
A force of 1600 police and stewards will be on standby in Dublin to
ensure there is no repeat of the rioting that led to the abandonment of
Ireland's match against England on February 15.
Eighty police, double the number in attendance for last month's
friendly, will patrol the Lansdowne Road stadium on the day of the game.
UEFA will have observers at the match, which it has labelled a
category A security risk. Any trouble could land the Football
Association of Ireland with a hefty fine or possibly a ban from playing
at Lansdowne Road.
TOUTS will be arrested and tickets seized as part of an impressive
police operation to prevent any trouble at the European Cup-winners' Cup
semi-final first leg between Real Zaragoza and Chelsea in Spain next
week.
Ian Bradley, the British vice-consul in Barcelona, said yesterday:
''The plan is to stop any Chelsea fans who are travelling without
tickets from getting into the match.''
The 2500 official Chelsea fans travelling to the industrial city in
north-east Spain in a fleet of charter flights will not be arriving
until the evening of the match and will leave the same night.

Bored by science? Or blinded by it? Gerard Seenan
invites you all to come to Edinburgh and be converted
GET your test tubes in the rack, light your Bunsen burner and let the
H[2]O flow, because science doesn't have to be boring. Or so says Dr
Simon Gage, acting director of the Edinburgh International Science
Festival.
''Science is interesting,'' he enthuses. ''It's progressive, it
changes all the time and it's constantly being advanced so it doesn't
stagnate. It has produced some remarkable results and it has affected
our lives drastically in both spectacular and interesting ways.
''It's very broad and it covers an enormous range of activities, from
the very big -- like the big bang -- to the subatomic, so there's a mass
of material there and a mass of different ways of going about it.''
The Edinburgh International Science Festival runs from March 31 to
April 17 and is now in its seventh year. It is becoming increasingly
popular and diverse. This year activities range from the world's largest
Star Trek exhibition -- rumours that even William Shatner's toupee is on
display are said to be without foundation -- to a lecture on the science
of the pizza.
But if you're still not convinced, and the thought of anything to do
with science sends tears of boredom rolling down your cheeks, then Dr
Gage urges you to come along and be converted -- a sort of road to
Damascus via Edinburgh. ''If you think science is boring then the best
remedy is to come and attend something.
''We scour the country for people who are good communicators and we
only ask people who are working in subject areas that we think are
interesting and up to date. It's rather like buying a car from a good
brand: we think we are a good brand and that you can rely on us to come
up with good people,'' says Dr Gage.
Dr Gage believes science and scientists get a bad press, portrayed as
boffins in white coats thinking inpenetrable thoughts by a media largely
ignorant of the whole subject area. However, the science establishment,
says Dr Gage, must also bear some of the blame for its poor image.
''Scientists generally don't have a very great interest in promoting
themselves. Compared to the arts, where each theatre company, each
cinema, will have some sort of press office or some agency dedicated
entirely to promoting its subject matter, there is almost no promotion
in science,'' he says.
The science festival aims to redress this imbalance through a series
of hands-on workshops, events, and lectures designed predominantly for
the layman. Dr Gage sees the role of the festival clearly. ''It is a
means of breaking down the barrier that exists between those who
practise science and those who have an interest in it and are consumers
of it.
''More specifically it is a way of breaking down the barriers between
academics, practitioners of science, people who research science and
technology, people who make policy about science, and the general
public,'' he says.
So if you're feeling the need to have your barriers broken or your
preconceptions shattered, the science festival is the place to go.

ONE of the final sessions of the YES Conference, chaired by Kirsty
Wark, was devoted to an Enterprise Forum in which the panel of Marlyn
Orcharton, Alan Devereux, and Frank McKenzie answered questions from
conference delegates.
Q: Are women doing enough for themselves as they aspire to higher
professional positions?
Marlyn Orcharton: One of the benefits of being a married woman is that
you are more able to switch careers. There's still a glass ceiling, but
it's mainly a culture thing now. For example, my daughter and her
husband have attitudes which are completely different to those I
experienced. There are certainly plenty of opportunities around.
Frank McKenzie: Six out of my 15 staff are female, and two of them are
designers.
Q: Do you ever feel like giving up?
Alan Devereux: Yes. Everybody gets terribly weary with the burden of
demanding jobs. My years at the Scottish Tourist Board were like that. I
tried pulling back for a week or two but it nearly drove me round the
bend. The secret is not to distinguish between work and pleasure.
Frank McKenzie: I've never felt like giving up. I would have done
anything to be self-employed.
Q: Are universities in touch with business needs?
Marlyn Orcharton: My son studied systems engineering. He and three
others got jobs, the rest didn't. Universities let people down in not
following through and helping them to find job placements. They also
fail students by not teaching them business skills.
Q: Is the marketplace too competitive for start-up firms?
Alan Devereux: Competition varies from one business area to another.
Sometimes the cost of entry is too high -- if you're thinking about
building aeroplanes, forget it. On the other hand, think of businesses
like hairdressing, where initial costs are relatively low. There's a lot
of competition around, but you can always find ways of doing things
better.
Q: Why are there not more women managers and directors?
Alan Devereux: They are often reluctant to push the boat out. They
don't want to be seen getting things wrong. That's a pity, because they
have a judgment, a wisdom, a perspective about people. My biggest
mistakes have occurred when I haven't had a woman at my side.
Marlyn Orcharton: Women think differently. Their idea of teamwork is
that people actually work together. Men are afraid of women in the
boardroom because they're always ready to ask questions.
Q: Have we become a less caring society?
Alan Devereux: Yes. Society is now totally materialistic. The Japanese
have succeeded because they have underlying values in education,
society, and the family.
Marlyn Orcharton: Don't knock success. Don't confuse it with values.
Making soup for the homeless helps fewer people than running a business
that recruits the unemployed.
Q: What advice have you for those in their last year at school?
Frank McKenzie: Think seriously about yourself. Do you really want to
work for somebody else?
Marlyn Orcharton: Make the most of whatever you do. Get as many exam
passes as possible. There's nothing I hate more than hearing people say
they're bored. It's a wonderful life.
Q: How do you measure the success of a company?
Frank McKenzie: Business growth. Profit margins. Product quality.
Customer relationships.
Alan Devereux: What matters is what the customer thinks of you.
Marlyn Orcharton: A happy staff. You'll know you've got that if they
come to work regularly and on time. East Kilbride is the most successful
new town of all because 70,000 people live there and have a good
attitude to their work.

RANGERS and Celtic are flavour of the month in the Russian squad's
training camp as they prepare for the European Championship qualifier
tomorrow against Scotland.
Yesterday as they returned to Moscow, striker Dimitry Radchenko
revealed that he has had a hush-hush meeting with Parkhead manager Tommy
Burns.
That news followed the ''come-and-get-me'' message Andrei Kanchelskis
sent to Rangers when he declared he would be leaving Manchester United
at the end of the season.
Radchenko has been trailed patiently by Celtic. Their chief scout,
Davie Hay, has watched him play for Real Santander half-a-dozen times
this season.
Yesterday the 24-year-old insisted: ''My club in Spain has kept me
informed about Celtic's interest. They told me that Celtic have agreed
to pay #2.2m for my transfer.
''After we played Real Madrid a few weeks ago, I met the Celtic coach
and we talked for several minutes. So far, however, there has not been
any talk with them about a contract, and my personal terms.
''But I know they have been looking at me and I know, too, that they
are ready to pay the money Real Santander want.''
The front man, who played for Spartak Moscow, is a key player for his
country in the clash tomorrow. ''It would be good for me to score
against Scotland, and play well, and show all the Celtic supporters what
I can do,'' he said. ''There will be several of their players in
Scotland's team, so I can get to know them.
''At the moment nothing will happen but, at the end of the season, if
Celtic make me an attractive offer, then I will be there playing in
Glasgow. My club are now ready to take the money -- so it is up to
Celtic to speak to me and work out a deal. The idea of playing there
appeals to me.''
Radchenko and Kanchelskis -- whom Manchester United yesterday insisted
would honour his contract -- could finish up on opposite sides of the
great Old Firm divide next season -- but here in the Russian capital,
they will be important players for their country. Radchenko's importance
has been underlined further by the injury which will keep his front-line
partner, German based Sergrei Kiryukov, out of the side.
Russian coach Oleg Romantsev, like Scotland's Craig Brown, has
suffered cruel injury blows. But whereas Brown searches desperately for
players of quality, Romantsev has them in abundance. Yet, still, he
worries over the match, over the fighting spirit of the Scots, if not
their skills, and remains convinced that this will be the most difficult
qualifying game his side have faced.
* DARKNESS had fallen over Moscow last night when Scotland arrived in
the Russian capital, but by the end of this adventure, Craig Brown
believes his squad's prospects of qualifying for the European finals in
England will be brighter, writes James Traynor.
The Russians, he says, would be foolish to underestimate the strength
of Scotland even though many players are unavailable.
As though Brown did not have enough problems, he had to excuse Stewart
McKimmie from training because the defender was feeling the effects of a
damaged instep. If he fails to prove his fitness by noon today he will
be discounted and Aberdeen team-mate Stephen Wright would earn a third
senior cap.
Brown's intention is to play Alan McLaren, Colin Hendry, and Colin
Calderwood at the heart of the defensive line.
Calderwood, the 30-year-old Tottenham Hotspur player, is relishing his
opportunity. ''I did think my time had passed, but I intend to make the
most of this chance,'' he said.
Brown will not confirm his team until nearer the kick off, but he
stressed that it would be ''a 13-man job.''
The SFA, whose main people would have been at Davie Cooper's funeral
yesterday had they been able to change the time of the flight to Moscow,
observed a minute's silence, which was a moving experience. One or two
of the players had tears in their eyes as the Scottish winger was
remembered.
If the Scots are to threaten the Russian defence, then Gary
McAllister, Paul McStay, and John Collins will have to impose
themselves.
Each of the Celtic men has been dropped by manager Tommy Burns but
both were restored quickly and Brown has enough faith to ask them to
create the chances John McGinlay and Duncan Shearer will need. If ever
there was a time for them to prove they can run a midfield, it will be
tomorrow night.
Both realise the enormity of the task, and Collins said: ''The
Russians are good on the ball, they all seem to be comfortable in
possession, and it will be important for us to make sure we don't give
the ball away easily.''
It is to his liking that he will be deployed in a three-man midfield,
with the full backs, McKimmie or Wright, and Tommy Boyd, pushing up to
assist.
While the midfield players will have to excel, a great deal will be
expected again from Boyd, who is likely to be detailed to mark Andrei
Kanchelskis, whose pace is electrifying.
''His speed is his main asset, of course, and a defender has to be on
his toes to compete with him,'' Boyd said.
The defender has great respect for Kanchelskis, but he is not the best
winger he has had to play against. ''Brian Laudrup is a far better
player. Kanchelskis is sheer pace, but Laudrup has more skill,'' Boyd
said.

GRAND PRIX POSTSCRIPT
AS Grand Prix motor racing dragged itself to the end of the 1994
season, the prayer of everyone involved was that 1995 just had to be
better. But it's all started to happen again this year, with the
disqualification from Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix of winner Michael
Schumacher and second placed David Coulthard because, they say, of fuel
irregularities.
On the basis of no more than the deaths, on consecutive days, of
Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna, 1994 was an appalling year, but on
top of these came the near misses from which Rubens Barrichello, Jos
Verstappen and Karl Wendlinger only narrowly escaped.
Then there was all the bitching about whether or not championship
leader Michael Schumacher's car was legal. And the way in which
Schumacher finally clinched the title, namely by driving into a piece of
road which already had Damon Hill in it, added yet another sour note to
an already unharmonious season.
Some of what happened last year has to be put down, alas, to fate. The
two deaths were so shocking because, ironically, Formula One has become
relatively safe. Cars and circuits have been developed to such an extent
that drivers are nowadays walking away from accidents which they could
not possibly have survived twenty years ago.
But, inevitably, this involves a certain amount of luck, and that
can't last forever. Ratzenberger and Senna were tragically unfortunate.
A lot of the other problems, though, were down to Formula One doing
what it is especially good at -- being clumsy. Grand Prix racing is a
spectacularly complicated sport, and its legislation is unavoidably
complex. Even so, you sometimes wonder whether the decision makers
realise how silly they can sometimes make the sport look. But that's
what Formula One is like.
So now the 1995 season is a few days old and already we get a nice,
juicy controversy.
Three points you might like to consider. First, none of this is the
fault of Schumacher or Coulthard personally, because they have no say in
what fuel they use (You might then ask why they are the ones that have
been fined $30,000 each). Second, it is practically beyond belief that
the teams involved, Benetton and Williams, really were cheating, but, of
course, Grand Prix teams are very honest. Oh, yes.
Well, actually, no. What I mean is that they are made up of extremely
clever people who can think up much better ways of bending the rules
than just pouring in dodgy fuel. Not much point in doing that when you
know it's going to be checked.
Third, the fuel may not be dodgy at all. The official reason for the
exclusion is that the fuel sample taken after qualifying in Brazil did
not match that supplied by the manufacturer, Elf, before the season
started. Nobody has actually said that the Brazilian sample is illegal,
nor even that it is better than the pre-season one, just that it's not
the same. Elf say it is.
Benetton and Williams are both allowed to appeal, and I understand
that they are both going to. I'm guessing here, but I can't help feeling
that some silly miscalculation will become apparent, the appeal will be
upheld, and Schumacher and Coulthard will be reinstated.
If that is what happens, the whole business will become a mildly
embarrassing non-story which will barely figure in the end-of-season
reviews. Surely, people will then say, it would have been better to have
a word with the teams and get the whole thing cleared up out of court
rather than disqualify first and ask questions later? A grown-up World
Championship shouldn't really behave the way this one has.
And there are worse things that could happen. If, for example, we had
the choice between silly squabbles over fuel, like this year, or the
deaths of two drivers, like last year, then give me the 1995 option any
day.
One more thing. Hardly any Grand Prix incident passes without a
conspiracy theory of some sort being concocted, so let's make one up
now. You'll recall that Nigel Mansell fluttered back into Formula One
amid much ballyhoo, but is having to miss the first few rounds because,
so help me, his multi-million pound car is too small for him. His
championship chances are therefore badly compromised, to the point where
he might decide not to race at all.
This is deeply bad news for the interested parties who wanted him
back. So how about this: Schumacher and Coulthard, two of Mansell's
major rivals, open up an immediate gap on him at the start of the
season. Disqualify them, and on paper the race is won by Gerhard Berger.
Well, I'm sorry, but Berger ain't going to win the championship because
his Ferrari isn't good enough. The real contenders are all back at
square one, tying on zero points. Mansell realises he is still in with a
shout and says yes, he will come back to play. Phew, think the
interested parties, that was close.
Silly, of course, but when you've been following professional
motorsport for a few years your mind starts to work that way.

The tail swishes back and forth quieter than the wind.
The fins are tissue paper flowing with the current.
The colour of his lovely skin a golden spoon of honey.

He is a prisoner. He is alone. The only company is his own reflection.

THE DRUGS DEBATE
Shadow was a Gladiator who recently got fired
Taking steroids to make him strong because he was so tired.
Every man and woman knows that drugs are wrong to do
Runners like Ben Johnson have taken steroids, too.
Oh, what a pity they both took drugs, ruining their careers
In a moment's madness, they'll pay for it for years
Drugs can stimulate, drugs can thrill
Sometimes, though, drugs can kill!
-- Lynsey Lightfoot, 3rd year, Forrester High, Edinburgh.
Ecstasy has been around for almost 80 years and is sometimes known as
''E''. Since 1985 anyone in possession of ''E'' would be charged and has
a risk of being put in jail.
Can cause weight loss, fatigue, anxiety, paranoia, depression and
kills!
So don't take it, better safe than sorry.
Those caught and punished have ruined their reputations, but they're
the lucky ones.
As they still have a life to lead, unlike the many young drug users
who have died.
Should you forget what happened to Andrew Stoddart and the other two
youngsters who all died in the same week from taking ''E'' at the Hanger
13 nightclub in Ayr?
You could be the next, unless you take care and don't get involved
with drugs!

OF the many workshops, events, and exhibitions available at the
seventh Edinburgh International Science Festival, GERARD SEENAN selects
the following must-see recommendations:
* The Science Dome, in Princes Street Gardens, has a whole host of
daily events, from cybercafes to coded maps, as well as a series of
one-off spectaculars, including Radio 1 and Radio 4 Sound of Science
Roadshow.
* Computer Minds at the Merchants' Hall, Hanover Street, is intended
to make even the most ardent of technophobes more comfortable with
computers. It's an exhibition from La Villette in Paris designed to
teach you to interact with your computer. Apparently this does include
tuition and how to thump it more effectively when you make a mistake.
* Why not go along to a tour of the police forensic laboratory in
Howden Hall Road? Guaranteed to satisfy even the most gruesome. You can
learn how to interpret blood splashes and patterns at crime scenes -- no
doubt it'll come in handy one day. The tour runs on April 5 to 11 and
tickets must be booked from the science festival box office in advance.
* Science Works at Adam House is running a multitude of events, from
talks on the genetic lottery -- find out why you were the unfortunate
one who ended up with red hair -- to demonstrations of recent
innovations, including a 5ft ball pen. It'll never catch on.
* The Education Centre at the Royal Museum of Scotland is hosting
hands-on workshops where you can learn to build everything from a bird's
nest to a rocket. Don't let the word education put you off. It actually
looks fun.

Ross Cunningham and Jonothan McLeod find a consistent theme running
through the current crop of British pop magazines
THE one thing magazines have in common nowadays is . . . SHERYL CROW.
From the pages of Loaded to a centrespread in Salmon and Trout Monthly,
the woman is everywhere. By the time this girl's done she'll be bigger
than Barry White's boxers.
The same tired old artists are continually being thrown at us by the
recording industry, so when a new face appears the publicity machine
goes into overdrive. Magazines provide a means whereby these artists can
break through. The difficulty lies in maintaining a balance between fame
and infamy. Too many magazines this month have elicited the response,
''Oh God no, it's Sheryl Crow''.
Across Britain millions of magazines are sold every year. With the
growing demand for such publications there comes a widening selection to
choose from, each catering for individual demands and tastes.
Competition for sales is fierce and circulation can fluctuate according
to public preference. Publishers invest great sums of money to make
their titles appeal to us.
Smash Hits is aimed specifically at young girls. It favours young boy
bands who possess all the musical prowess of Naomi Campbell and are
almost as masculine. Its interviews are based on inane questions such as
''Where do babies come from?'' -- an indication of its readers'
intellect perhaps? Generally, though, Smash Hits seems to be more
preoccupied with boyzone rather than biology.
Select, meanwhile, is the Kylie Minogue of music mags -- small but
perfectly formed. Together with Vox, Q, and Mojo it provides a ladder
for music enthusiasts who graduate from magazine to magazine with the
passage of time. Vox and Select have much the same tastes, eg Pulp,
Blur, Sleeper etc while Q maintains a balance between chart success and
musical respectability. Aimed at an older audience, Q has the biggest
circulation and was made all the better this month thanks to an
interview with the publicity-shy Sheryl Crow. Mojo targets an even more
mature readership but is often rather boring, probably because
excitement will tend to set off its readers' pacemakers.
NME (New Musical Express) and Melody Maker are published weekly and
have a surprising influence on the British music industry. They have
been going strong for more than 40 years and show no signs of stopping.
Musical favourites include Gene, Shed Seven, Throwing Muses, and
Elastica. These publications are heavily influenced by the independent
music scene and tend to ignore most music outwith this field. They are
often accused of building bands up before knocking them down, as in the
case of S*M*A*S*H.
Sky and The Face are both unisex monthlies which deal with anything
from music to the media. They are generally up-market and target 21 to
30 year olds. This month The Face interviewed the non-vampiric Christian
Slater while Sky talked with that elusive songbird Sheryl Crow. Loaded
is a so-called lads' magazine which consists solely of football,
alcohol, and women and leans heavily on rather childish humour which is
actually quite funny (sorry). Unique is aimed at students and is the
only magazine of its kind to operate nationally. This month's issue
featured an interview with the Greta Garbo of pop, Sheryl Crow.
There is an increasing number of imported magazines. These are mainly
American and offer an insight not only into the US music industry but
also an insight into their insight into our music industry. A recent
issue of Spin magazine carried an article declaring that Britain had
become a patriotic land once more thanks to the wonder that is Blur.
Apparently we have resumed our flag-waving grandeur as we walk down
Carnaby Street eating jellied eels and laughing heartily in Dick Van
Dyke accents. And we owe it all to Blur. Cheers, mates.
The rather excellent Details magazine is also from America although to
read it you wouldn't guess so. It has an interview with the very British
Tom Jones and that other Brit, Sheryl Crow. What do you mean she's
American? It feels like she lives in my kitchen.

* ERIC CANTONA should be banned from football for life. He is one of
the world's greatest players but unfortunately his temperament lets him
down. No-one can justify what he did. He is paid more than enough to
compensate for the abuse.
If he played for Rangers or Celtic in an Old Firm game he'd spend all
the time attacking the fans. He is a disgrace to Manchester United,
France, football, and, of course, his fans. Manchester United must get
rid of him before he drags them down into the mud as well.
The FA claims the Premiership is one of the best leagues in the world,
but in truth the game's image has been tarnished by enough players to
make a team of their own.
-- Steven McEwan, 3rd year, Forrester High, Edinburgh.
It's time to go pro
* ''IT will be a sad day when a Scottish player runs on to the pitch
for club or country because he is being paid to rather than because he
wants to.''
This is the main argument against Scotland's most popular amateur
sport being turned professional, but David Campese hasn't lost the
desire to play for his country or passion to play due to
professionalism. Campese, who is now well into his thirties, is one of
the very few players who plays rugby all year round in Australia and
Italy.
Scottish international rugby players' main concerns are to play well
for their country and help produce victories, but these players who work
hard to gain their caps are also entertaining the public, not only the
67,000 who watch at Murrayfield, but the millions who watch rugby on TV.
Unlike footballers, tennis players, or even actors, these entertainers
are not paid. Most of them pay their club subscriptions for the sheer
honour. Even Gavin Hastings pays a #40 subscription to his club
(Watsonians) annually.
Players are now becoming athletes with practically full-time training
programmes, but they have to hold down full-time jobs and careers as
well. These players should be properly compensated for their hard work
and given more training time to work towards excellence without so many
other pressures, eg work and careers.
The only answer is to turn to professionalism. Professionalism would
also help with the Scottish club scene and marketing of the game. The
vast majority of top rugby players, not only in Scotland but all over
the world, would like to see a change to professionalism and if it is
going to help them and improve the game then the RFU should introduce it
before the World Cup.
-- Alana Muir, Forrester High, 3rd year, Edinburgh.
Yes, it's a strip-off
* I THINK it's terrible that Manchester United keep on changing their
football strips. Children like to keep up to date with the latest strips
and inevitably they want the new ones. So they'll end up spending all
their pocket money on football strips.
I don't think football teams should be able to change strips so
frequently. It's not about how good they are, it's about how much they
make.
I wouldn't be surprised if the supporters didn't know what team they
are looking for, because maybe they go to one of their matches and they
have got one strip on and the next time they go they've got on a
different strip.
I just think it's terrible and I agree with the papers -- it is a
rip-off.
-- Pamela Doonin, St Joseph's Primary, Blantyre.
Paying for the name
* THEY'RE at it again. As if it's not enough to have a home strip and
an away strip, now Manchester United is introducing another fashion
strip.
Most of the boys in my class are football crazy and expect to get the
new strip as soon as it is introduced. This is very unfair to parents,
as these strips are very expensive. All they are paying for is the name.
One of the rules in my school is ''No football club colours''.
This practice of introducing new strips so often only encourages
children to break the rules. As far as I can see, it doesn't matter if
you wear the old or new, they are all Manchester United anyway.
-- Mhairi Jamieson, aged 12, St Mary's Primary, Bathgate, West
Lothian.

letters. Each receives a Herald sweatshirt in our FairPlay competition.

SCOTTISH tennis lost one of its stalwarts on Saturday with the death
of Grace White, whose involvement in the sport as a player,
administrator, and official spanned a period from the 1920s to the
1980s.
Grace, who was 90, played at the Waverley Club for many years with
considerable success. After her playing days, she sought to put
something back into the sport and acted for many years as match
secretary for the East of Scotland Association.
However, she was best known for her work in the development of tennis
officiating in Scotland. Grace was a founder member and long-serving
secretary of the East of Scotland Umpires Association which serviced all
major events in the country from the mid-50s and was instrumental, some
20 years later, in taking officiating in Scotland from the amateur to
the professional era.

SANTA Concerto's victory in the ''bumper'' at Bangor on Saturday gave
Len Lungo his twenty-third winner of the season and a commanding lead in
the Herald Scottish Trainers' championship.
He is now seven clear of his nearest rival, Peter Monteith, with Colin
Parker in third place, 12 behind the leader.
Lungo, odds-on favourite to take the title, has had five winners from
32 runners in the past month, despite having to withdraw horses at the
last minute on several occasions because of unfavourable ground.
Although Lungo appears to be ''home and hosed'' already, ground
conditions over the next two months could determine whether he receives
the cheque for #1000 and trophy at the inaugural Scottish Racing Awards
dinner in Glasgow on June 23.
The Carrutherstown trainer, now in his fifth season, is certainly not
over-confident. He is only four short of last season's total of 27, but
is not certain he will better it.
''If we have a dry spring and the ground firms up, I could be
struggling, as I don't have a lot of top-of-the-ground horses,'' he
confessed.
Scotland's two most important three-day jumps festivals, at Ayr and
Perth, are only a few weeks away, and that is where Monteith and Parker
must try to make inroads into Lungo's lead.
Monteith has nine fewer horses than Lungo in training, but more
late-season runners. Unfortunately, Aragon Ayr is out for the season
with a chipped bone, but Master Bavard, who re-appeared at Kelso on
Friday, could spearhead a challenge from the Whitebog yard.
Mrs Dawn Goodfellow, of Earlston, with three winners from eight runnrs
last month, is leading permit-holder with six, one ahead of Hawick's
Alistair Whillans.
Sadly, Jack Andrews, of Ladybank in Fife, is out of contention
following the tragic death at Kelso on Friday of his Eastern Oasis.
The 12-year-old chaser was a winner twice this season and of 10 races
in all -- seven over hurdles and three over fences -- worth total prize
money of more than #22,000. Leaders:
HERALD LEADING TRAINERS AWARD
Len Lungo 23; Peter Monteith 16; Colin Parker 11; Jim Goldie 6; Tom
Dyer, Susan Bradburne 5;  Jim Barclay 4; Ken Oliver 2; Tom Kemp, Swanee

HAVING guided City of Glasgow Ragazzi to their third successive league
and cup double, coach Tommy Dowens now turns his attentions to the
Scotland international team.
As Scotland coach, he has found success elusive. Defeats by England
and Lithuania in the Pan European Cup in Oxford earlier this month leave
him with some work to do before the Spring Cup in Portugal in May.
Dowens was concerned about his team's blocking in Oxford, and Great
Britain coach Ralph Hippolyte will come north this weekend to help
improve that.
''I hope to announce my squad within the next fortnight but there are
a couple of positions I have still to decide on,'' Dowens said
yesterday.
There was some good news at the weekend with confirmation that
Kilmarnock captain Michael Rhodes would be available after having
changed his mind about taking up a job in Somerset. His employers have
offered him promotion and he will remain in Ayrshire, and continue to be
available for club and country.
One player who will not feature in the Scotland team for Portugal is
Kilmarnock hitter Paul Carruthers, who caused Dowens' club plenty of
problems in the Royal Bank Scottish Cup final on Sunday.
''He was not able to give the commitment to the squad which involves
three or four training sessions a week,'' explained Dowens. But
Kilmarnock coach Jim McKenna, a former Scotland captain, said he felt
Carruthers could still do a job for Scotland.

THE Scottish Rugby Union believes that international prop Peter Wright
would never have been shown the yellow card in the Grand Slam showdown
against England if the referee had been from Scotland or any of the
Southern Hemisphere nations.
Wright became the first Scottish player to receive a yellow-card
warning in an international when Irish referee Brian Stirling pulled him
up for stamping on England captain Will Carling.
The Boroughmuir prop claimed at the time that he had been rucking, not
stamping, and that Carling was wilfully lying on the wrong side of a
ruck with the intention of impeding Scottish ball.
SRU secretary Bill Hogg maintained at the monthly Murrayfield news
briefing yesterday that some referees were not interpreting rucking
legislation as laid down in the laws, and that this was one of the
issues which would be high on the agenda at a laws' interpretation
meeting to be convened by the International Board in France next month.
He also revealed that the SRU -- independently of the Wright incident
-- has concluded that this season's experimentation with red and yellow
cards had not been a success, and that they would be recommending to the
IB that it be dispensed with.
Referees, and particularly those from England, who do not allow
rucking sides like Scotland and New Zealand to remove players who go to
ground at ruck situations, are doing the game a disservice and,
simultaneously, are storing up trouble for themselves as frustration
sets in.
Hogg declined to criticise Stirling for his handling of the Twickenham
game and confined himself to the comment: ''If the referee had been from
Scotland or from any of the Southern Hemisphere nations, then a yellow
card would not have been shown.''
He said Scotland played a rucking style that was accepted in the
Southern Hemisphere, but some other Unions and referees did not allow
players to ruck properly.
''The laws interpretation meeting will take place at Avignon from
April 21-23. The question of rucking will be brought up. We want
interpretation of the law as it is written in the book,'' said Hogg.
So far as the use of red and yellow cards by referees was concerned,
Hogg said that the experiment had been designed to give spectators a
better idea of what was going on.
However, when England's Ben Clarke had been yellow-carded in the game
against Ireland, there had been confusion over just what had taken
place. Similarly, when Wright received his official warning at
Twickenham, many spectators in the stadium missed the moment when
Stirling showed the card.
''So far as the red card for a sending-off is concerned, there is no
need for that at all. If the guy is sent off then he has gone and nobody
is in any doubt,'' said Hogg.
The SRU also announced yesterday that two rugby league players in
Scotland -- both of whom were featured in The Herald -- were to be
welcomed back to the Union fold. The IB at its annual meeting earlier
this month relaxed its hitherto stern attitude towards defectors to
League with a ruling which allowed professionals to return to the
amateur ranks after three years.
Under separate legislation, Tony Howard, a former Salford rugby league
player who maintains that he had never previously played rugby union,
will be allowed to play the union game after the elapse of two years.
Grant Harris, a former Hawick flanker who enlisted with Carlisle, but
who only ever received expenses, will be allowed back after one year.
Both should be eligible to play next season.
Harris was on holiday abroad yesterday, but 26-year-old Howard, a 6ft,
16-stone centre who is now a policeman in Falkirk, and whose case was
pursued by the Grangemouth club, said: ''That's great news. Grangemouth
have done a lot of work on my behalf and I'll be turning out for them
next season.''

GLASGOW Brightsiders, still seeking their first Scottish League title
after another morale-shattering defeat by Livingston Bulls, want the
league re-structured next season to make it more competitive.
With the support of Edinburgh Burger Kings, they have re-submitted
proposals for a six-team first or premier division, with up to 10 teams
taking part in a second division.
The proposals will be considered at a meeting of national league clubs
at Meadowbank on Sunday before the Scottish Cup final, when the Glasgow
club meet Bulls again. Brightsiders are concerned at ridiculously easy
wins for themselves, Livingston, and Edinburgh against teams outwith the
top three.
''There must be incentive for teams to compete and at present there
are too many teams just going through the motions,'' said Glasgow coach
James McKechnie.
He was critical of his players after their 76-67 league defeat at
Easterhouse. It was the second time this season that they had been in
the driving seat against their rivals and still lost. With their
considerable height advantage, they were clear favourites last Sunday.
But the difference between the teams was the amazing Iain Maclean.
Brightsiders will have to find a way to stop him on Sunday as Bulls
chase the double for the seventh year in a row.

national sides. Group A contains the top sides with Scotland alongside
Argentina and Russia. The other group A sides are South Africa, Spain,
Poland, Italy, Uruguay, Portugal, France, Wales and Romania.
The Scottish side, managed by 1990 Grand Slam captain David Sole, has
arranged a tough warm-up against their English counterparts at Stirling
County's Bridgehaugh ground on Saturday.
Yesterday Sole said: ''This will be our first appearance in this
competition and a good opportunity for our lads to gain invaluable
experience of competitive rugby at international level. It will expose
them to sides which will, in all probability, be physically more
advanced and it will give them a benchmark to aim for in the future.''

EDINBURGH Racers' Chris Palmer eyed tonight's British Championship
Group B play-off against Durham Wasps at Murrayfield and vowed: ''We can
go all the way.''
Palmer, with 11 goals in his past three games, added: ''I've hit a
purple patch and I'm keeping my fingers crossed it keeps going. We're
not playing badly right now, and have a real chance of making Wembley.''
Fife Flyers open their Group A campaign at home to free-scoring
Humberside Hawks. Forward Derek King faces a late test on a shoulder
injury.
Flyers also face new premier champions Sheffield Steelers, and their
long-time title rivals, Nottingham Panthers. Coach Jim Lynch, who has
guided his men to seven wins in their past eight games, said: ''Sure
it's a tough section, but anyone who gets a run going now can claim a
place at Wembley -- and that's what we're aiming to do.''
The top two from each group travel to Wembley on Saturday, April 15,
for the championship semi-finals.
Paisley Pirates open their promotion play-off campaign tonight with a
home clash against Peterborough Pirates. Fixtures:
British Championship play-offs: Group A: Fife v Humberside (8.0).
Group B: Edinburgh v Durham (8.0).
Promotion play-offs: Group A: Paisley v Peterborough (8.0).

A BRILLIANT century by Justin Gayfer wasn't enough to stop the West
District Under-19s sliding to defeat in the opening match of their
Indian tour yesterday.
The Ferguslie star hit an unbeaten 101 as the Scots rattled up an
impressive 284 for four against the Bombay Gymkhana Club. He received
strong support from Kilmarnock's Drew Parsons, who struck a whirlwind 77
off just 46 balls.
But the hard-hitting home team raced to the target with seven wickets
and more than three overs to spare.
The tourists struck an early run-out blow with the score on 32, but
they were sunk by a partnership of 201 between Azad Pagnis and Zahid
Bharucha.
West manager Alan Mills said: ''We performed pretty well considering
we arrived only two days ago. But the batting of the Indian boys was out
of this world.'' Scores:
West District Under-19 284 for four (J Gayfer 101 n.o., D Parsons 77,
C Wright 40); Bombay Gymkhana 286 for three (A Pagnis 131, Z Bharucha
100). Gymkhana won by seven wickets.
* AUSTRALIA were 322 for five at the close of play on the second day
of their four-day match against a West Indies President's XI in St
Lucia. Rain prevented play on the first day.
* NEW Zealand beat Sri Lanka by 33 runs in the one-day international
in Christchurch yesterday. Score:
New Zealand 271 for six (50 overs); Sri Lanka 238 (47.5 overs).

THERE is no way that Scotland's World Cup squad will underestimate
their first opponents, the Ivory Coast, even though there was no hint
from the Africans' performance at the Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Bank
Sevens at the weekend that they have the personnel or the power to
provide an early World Cup shock.
In their first appearance at the greatest rugby union show on earth,
the Africans showed some neat handling sequences, but seemed short of
physical presence and their heads tended to go down as the Australians
saw them off by 63-0, then the Canadians showed them some physical force
in winning the Plate quarter final by 41-7.
Six of the Ivory Coast 10-man squad were under 12 stones and there
biggest player, Amdou Kone, is just 6 feet 3 and 15 stone 6 lbs. Not a
lot there for Doddie Weir or Stewart Campbell to lose sleep over.
Yet the Ivoronians have a sharp competitor in wing Paulin Bouazo, who
ignored the onset of malaria to score three of their four tries, and
their captain and stand off, Altonase Dali, showed some creative touches
to underline the experience he has gained in playing in France's second
division.
The Hong Kong tournament is just something else. This one, set before
an ecstatic audience in the most striking rugby union stadium in the
world, saw some of the most exciting and spectacular sevens action
imaginable with over 270 tries in 45 ties and a riveting climax as New
Zealand gave a staggering demonstration of short game arts in seeing off
Fiji by 28-17.
The New Zealanders clearly reckoned that one method of making that
Fijian sevens magician, Waisale Serevi, seem actually human, was to run
a large road roller straight at him. The demolition expert set this task
was that extremely large 19-year-old called Jonah Lomu who tips the
scales at a miserable 18[1/2] stones and has an impressive top gear as
well. Twice Serevi bounced off him like a bit of confetti as Lomu set
the earth trembling on his way to two tries.
It surely will interest Greenyards fraternity, too, that three of the
winning New Zealand Seven -- Peter Woods, Joe Tauiwi and Adrian Cashmore
-- have played for Bay of Plenty at the Melrose Sevens.
The Hong Kong tournament has everything, including a tens competition
on the Wednesday and Thursday that attracts some of the most famous
players in the world.
The sevens format is ideal. Two ties for each country on the Saturday,
then, depending on the results of those, three separate sevens
championships on Sunday.
Of course there was disappointment among the many Scots in the island
colony that their country was not represented. The Scottish Rugby Union
felt that because of the domestic programme of important league games
and the proximity of the England v Scotland international to the Hong
Kong tournament, Scotland just did not have time to prepare adequately
for Hong Kong participation.
That was understandable. The Hong Kong event has shown that Scots have
no devine right to the game's skills and ploys or to its highest
honours. There are unlikely fellows all over the world, some slant of
eye and no bigger than beer barrels, others tall, gangly, athletic and
vigorous, all of whom have taken to the short game like ducks to water.
That the very best is required to just keep heads above water at Hong
Kong Sevens was shown on Sunday when England took a youthful squad with
strong belief that they could emulate their 1993 World Sevens champion
predecessors. They found, however, that once in among the big boys of
sevens, it is a different ball game.
In the Cup quarter final, they were subjected to a series of withering
tackles of high intensity by a bunch of young Australians who cruised
through by 26-0.
Still, there were Scots on parade. The chairman of the Hong Kong RFU,
Stuart Leckie, alongside the inimitable Ian Robertson of the BBC,
provided on television's big screen from the middle of the pitch a guide
to the breathtaking colour of the Festival of Youth in which 1500
youngsters took part as prelude to the March Past of the playing squads
that lends a unique ingredient to the rich diversity of the entire
programme.
There was that famous son of Burnbrae, Sandy Carmichael, expressing a
viewpoint on England and Brian Moore in characteristic forthright
fashion. Gavin and Craig were there as well. The public address
announcements were by Pat MacLachlan, who played four times for Scotland
out of Oxford University in 1954.
However the message was clear. Melrose and Scotland gave the
abbreviated game to the world 112 years ago, but much of that world has
caught up and indeed has gone ahead.
That, surely, will be further underlined when the World Sevens are
staged in Hong Kong in 1997.

IN Tignes, France, at The British Land British championships, the
weather closed in yesterday morning, before dawn, bringing strong winds
and heavy snow forcing the postponement of the British downhill
championship until later this week.
This means that both Bell brothers, Martin and Graham may now be able
to compete.
Graham's late season bid to get back inside the world's top-40
rankings in downhill means he is racing currently in the French
championship downhill, just down the valley, in Les Arcs. Yesterday he
was third in training there, but that race was also cancelled.
If the British downhill is moved to Saturday, as current thinking has
it, then Martin -- who is expected in Tignes tomorrow -- might also be
able to race, and perhaps revive his hopes of a record fourth British
championships overall title.
Both men's and women's slaloms are now scheduled for today.
The Scottish Seniors FIS Championships, due to take place at Nevis
Range, Fort William, in just under two weeks time, have managed to
attract two of Sweden's top World Cup Women slalom specialists.
Kristina Anderssen (30) ranked world No.10 in slalom, has had two top
three finishes in World Cup slaloms this year and Titti Rodling (24)
ranked No.14, and this year's Europa Cup leader -- until she lost her
grip on the title over the last four races of the season -- were both
conirmed as entrants by the championships' chief, Frank Staddle,
yesterday.
There is enough money to fund four international places and Staddle is
still looking to bring over two Norwegian men's team members.
The aim of achieving a fully international field in either the men's
or women's contests is critical for the development of young British
skiers, but if more money could be found to bring five top international
racers for either event, it would automatically snowball as other lower
ranked international racers would enter seeking to improve their own
world rankings -- as they are formulated by performances against higher
ranked skiers.
Staddle is keen to hear from groups or individuals who could follow
the lead of the Scottish Ski Club and Aberdeen Ski Club, who have both
sponsored an international racer's airfare.
On current form, British Slalom champion Emma Carrick-Anderson could
give both Swedish girls a close race in both disciplines.

* UNSEASONABLY wintry weather has claimed its first victim of this
term's turf Flat racing programme.
Today's meeting at Newcastle was abandoned after a course inspection
yesterday revealed conditions which made racing impossible.
Clerk of the course James Hutchinson said: ''There is snow on the
course at the moment and it is unfit for racing.
''The forecast is for more snow and so we have taken the decision to
abandon the meeting.''
''I can't remember ever calling off a Flat meeting due to snow, but I
believe my predecessor at Ripon, Freddie Newton, once had to do so in
April.''
Another casualty in the north of England was yesterday's meeting at
Hexham, just 20 miles from Newcastle, but in this case it was heavy
overnight rain that forced the abandonment through waterlogging.
It was the sixty-fifth full jumps meeting lost to the weather during
the current season, but the first to be called off for 10 days.
Worcester's meeting tomorrow goes ahead after a Jockey Club
inspection.

THE Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team is not enjoying the best of
seasons. In fact, of the 23 games they've played thus far, the team has
drawn 10 and lost five. All of which has given rise to all kinds of
rumours and speculation in the local media.
Among the most repeated stories is one that states that the
English-speaking players on the team are organising an insurrection with
the intent of getting rid of Jacques Demers, the Canadiens'
French-Canadian coach. Matthieu Schneider was asked if he was one of the
''cancers'' causing dissent within the team. ''No,'' he replied coolly.
''I'm a Gemini.''
* BUM Phillips was one of the most respected coaches in the National
Football League. That respect remains, even though Phillips has retired,
and maintains few links with the sport to which he devoted so much of
his life.
He was recently asked how he is spending his retirement. Phillips
replied: ''I ain't doing a damn thing, and I don't start until noon.''
* JOURNALISTS are creatures of habit, especially when they write the
same old thing about the same old team, week in, week out. Such has been
the case with headline writers at the Los Angeles Times. Every week,
covering the LA Clippers basketball team, the headline has read:
''Clippers lose'' or ''Clippers lose again''.
So dire had things become that, following a recent unexpected Clippers
117-87 victory over the Detroit Pistons, the Times headline read:
''Clippers lose, oops, win by 30''.
* WITH former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson now released from
prison, Sports Illustrated spent considerable space in a recent issue
discussing the sorry state into which boxing has fallen since Tyson was
incarcerated three years ago. Now there are at least four organisations
all claiming their own world heavyweight champion, few of whom will
fight each other and even fewer of whom are any good.
To illustrate the true depths to which boxing has sunk, however, the
magazine drew on a single quote from renowned manager Bob Arum. In
attempting to explain some large inconsistency in his business dealings,
Arum commented: ''Yesterday I was lying, but today I'm telling the
truth.''
* ACRONYMS are an integral part of American speech and sport. Just
about every title and organisation is ultimately reduced to its
initials, as indicated by NOW (the National Organisation for Women),
MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), and PRRO (the Professional Road
Runners Organisation).
The baseball strike, still ongoing and disrupting a second season, has
even spawned its own organisation. A group formed to protest at team
owners' use of second-rate replacement players has called itself the
Newly Organised Society to Condemn Artificial Baseball. Put the initial
letters together and the group becomes NO SCAB.
* BEFORE a recent college basketball game between the University of
Utah and Brigham Young University, Utah coach Rick Majerus decided to
make a speech in tribute to departing Chinese player, Ma Jian. In front
of 15,447 spectators, Majerus said to Ma: ''You've followed your dream.
You were a positive influence and never a divisive player. I will do
everything in my power to see you get an NBA tryout.''
A nice speech, but one hardly imbued with great emotion. None the
less, Ma had tears in his eyes. In contrast, the attending fans just
looked at each other in bewilderment. Majerus had delivered his speech
in Ma's native Mandarin.
''I wanted him to know I respected him and cared for him,'' explained
Majerus. ''Sometimes these things get lost in the translation.''
* THE ripple effect from Michael Jordan's return to basketball
continues, and in some places one wouldn't ordinarily think of. The
Chicago Convention Bureau, for example, maintains that Jordan's return
to that city's basketball team will bring in an extra $160m in revenue.
In faraway Birmingham, Alabama, though, the reverse trend will
undoubtedly occur. During Jordan's playing days with the Birmingham
Barons baseball team in 1993, attendance soared to 467,000 from the
previous year's figure of 277,000. That figure is expected to slump
again.
NBA Properties, the company licensed to sell replicas of team uniforms
and such-like, also stands to profit. When Jordan retired, the Chicago
Bulls also retired his team number, 23. Now that he's back, Jordan has
refused to don his old number, taking instead 45. The outcome? Every
child in America is dumping his old 23 Bulls' shirt and demanding a
brand-new 45.
The most fortunate benefactor from Jordan's return, however, may be
his team-mate and friend, Scottie Pippen. It is rumoured that, as a
condition of his new contract, Jordan demanded that Pippen be given a
raise.

Augusta
THE fierce determination and pride in performance which drove Jack
Nicklaus to the greatest career in golf has been called back into play
as the 55-year-old endeavours to revive his flagging on-course fortunes.
Right now he is playing more golf than at any time since he first
swung a club at the age of ten, and recently gave the clearest
indication yet that frustration may force him into early retirement.
''The reason I am playing more golf than ever before is that I have
been playing so lousy, I need to compete to get my game back in shape,''
he said as he missed his second consecutive cut last week. Having failed
to qualify the previous week in the Nestle Invitational at old rival
Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill Club, the Golden Bear missed out again in the
$3 million Players Championship at Sawgrass.
''I love playing golf but I have hated playing the way I have been for
the last few years, so this year I decided that if I am going to
continue playing I have to start playing well again.
''To give myself a chance to do that, I have to play more tournaments
and if I don't play well I will not play at all. Period. I will quit.
''I know at 55 I am not going to be able to play as well as I used to,
but I don't want to be slopping the ball all over the golf course all
day long.''
He would rather not play at all, but he will be at the Open at St
Andrews in July and it might not, after all, be his last pilgrimage to
what he has always said was his favourite place in golf.
''I have never told anyone this would be my last Open. It is not
certain I will stop playing the Open after this year, although I would
say this would be a good chance of it being my last -- but I might just
go back in the year 2000.
''The Old Course is a very special place. Most people's golfing
education seems not to be complete unless you have played in and won an
Open at St. Andrews,'' continued the holder of a record 18 major
championship titles and whose first victory as a professional was the
1962 US Open.
Now the greatest of them all, who won his first event as a ten year
old -- 'I threw a round of 121 at the rest of the field in the 10 and
Under junior championship at Scioto Country Club in my home town
Columbus, Ohio, and they wilted,'' -- could be close to bowing out of
what he calls The Greatest Game of All.
His performance in next week's Masters, his favourite tournament and
one he has won a record six times, could have a huge bearing on when
Jack William Nicklaus decides to put his clubs into retirement.

SCOTLAND internationalist Scott Booth has been ruled out of Aberdeen's
battle for premier-division survival.
The striker has been unable to train since scoring the goal which
earned Scotland a draw against Russia at Hampden last November.
Dons' assistant manager Drew Jarvie admitted yesterday: ''He has been
to see various specialists about the groin injury, and the only cure is
rest.
''We also had Duncan Shearer seriously injured playing for Scotland in
Finland earlier this season, so it's a worry, with four of our players
on duty in Russia this week. We will be hoping for better luck this time
than we have had in past internationals.''
Aberdeen will push defender Colin Woodthorpe further down the comeback
trail today in a re-arranged reserve game at Kilmarnock.
* DUNFERMLINE striker Hamish French, who broke his collarbone against
St Mirren, joins winger Kenny Ward as two of the club's key players now
out for the rest of the season.
Craig Robertson and Ivo Den Bieman added to manager Bert Paton's
problems yesterday. Robertson reported with a ''dead leg'' and the
Dutchman required three stitches over the weekend to an ankle injury.
Tommy Harrison is still out with a knee problem and central defender
Neale Cooper has been struggling for several weeks with a calf injury.
Paton would like to sign other players as cover but pointed out: ''So
many are now fully committed to their clubs at this point in the
season.''
* EAST Stirlingshire tonight aim to boost their bid for promotion from
the third division by winning at home against Queen's Park.
But manager Billy Little warned: ''We must get the points now as we
face a difficult run-in when we will be meeting other sides in the top
half of the table. In addition, the poor winter weather has meant extra
pressure on us, as we have a number of midweek games.''
Both Mungo McCallum and Colin Scott are still missing through injury
while Queen's will miss experienced Ross Caven. He is suspended after
having been cautioned during Saturday's match against Arbroath and then
shown a second yellow card in the tunnel after the game.
Alloa manager Bill Lamont also will impress upon his players that they
must beat Montrose tonight. He said: ''Our position is such that we must
get the three points to have a reasonable chance of promotion.''
Striker Barry Moffat is suspended but former Rangers midfielder Doug
Bell will play.

IF there is one group in sporting society who should be able to inform
the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the ''feelgood factor'' is
justified now and not at some indefinable point in the future, it must
surely consist of the members of the PGA Scottish region.
At Glenbervie yesterday its secretary, Neil Simpson, announced the
total prize money for the seven events which this season count on the
Ladbrokes Order of Merit will amount to #212,000, comprising six
tournaments over 72 holes and one match-play event.
These events will form the centrepiece of the 1995 programme, already
confirmed as being almost #750,000 in value.
The main programme now includes the revival of two events, the Granite
City Classic, underwritten by Aberdeen District Council, and the
Scottish PGA Match-play Championship, restored under the joint
sponsorship of Edinburgh Crystal and the Daily Express.
Untypically, the flagship event is the first, the Tartan Special
Scottish Professional Championship, worth #65,000 from May 18-21 at
Dalmahoy. It is followed, from June 14-16, by the #27,000 Northern Open,
which returns to Nairn.
The #22,500 Sunderland of Scotland Masters, from June 21-23, moves
from Westerwood to Gleddoch House. After that there are two tournaments
in August, the #30,000 SPGA Masters at Downfield (7-10) and the #25,000
Granite City Classic (15-18) at Hazlehead.
The new #25,000 Southern Open will be held from September 13-15 and
the Order of Merit, which carries a prize fund of #13,000, concludes
with the #30,000 match-play championship. Both events' venues have yet
to be confirmed.

JUST show us what your boat will do, please, Lawrie. Britain's most
successful yachtsman obliged.
Lawrie Smith steered his Ultra 30 at nearly 20 knots, its 15-foot
spinnaker pole aimed, like Captain Ahab's harpoon, straight at our press
boat.
So this was how Moby Dick felt.
Of course, Smith would bear off, wouldn't he? But in the freshening
north-easterly, he cut it too fine. The hulls frothed by, a cutlass
length apart, but the straining red spinnaker plucked at the stern
sheets, taught as bowstrings. It ripped like tissue paper, demolishing
the wind generator, and sent the fragmented vanes floating down the Tay.
They say that yachting is like standing in a shower and ripping up #20
notes. With #1500 worth of damage done in this particular blink of an
eye, one can see why.
And if that is what happens with just two yachts in proximity, it will
be maritime mayhem when six Ultra 30s contest the Dundee round of the
six-race Vauxhall Grand Prix from June 23 to 25. The other venues are
Portsmouth, Cowes, and West London.
The Dundee Partnership (the city and Tayside councils, plus Scottish
Enterprise Tayside) yesterday announced they are investing #40,000 in
the event. The races will be staged on a one-mile circuit close to
shore, between the rail and road bridges. Spectator craft are welcome,
and TV coverage is guaranteed. The three-day series follows the World
Power Boat Championship there last year, and could generate #1m for the
area, as well as being used to attract inward investment.
With a gate, between buoys, to be negotiated on each leg, the yachts
are often just feet apart, and dismastings are not uncommon. ''A big
gust caught us out,'' admitted Smith, after his too-close encounter with
the media vessel. ''We had to spill wind. There was nowhere to go.''
The Ultra 30 series has been described as yachting's equivalent of
sports-car racing. On yesterday's evidence that could read stock-car
racing.
Backing from a motor manufacturer is not coincidental. Smith's yacht,
Frontera, is supported by the event sponsors because they use the series
to market a four-wheel-drive vehicle. When not terrifying scribes and
photographers, the boats are towed out of the water, and can get stuck
on slipways.
''In view of that, it's entirely logical for us to be involved,'' said
Vauxhall's sponsorship and marketing manager Mike Nicholson, co-driver
for Jimmy McRae when he won the 1984 British Rally Championship.
The 30-foot yachts have a professional crew of nine, at least 20% of
them currently bidding for the Atlanta Olympics. ''Like grand-prix motor
racing, the technology has got out of hand,'' says Smith. ''But these
Ultras are all the same, making it a test of skill alone.''
Smith, an Olympic medallist and America's Cup veteran, has won the
series for the past three years, and is hopeful of retaining the title.
But if he were a diplomat, not to mention a public relations expert,
then Smith would have been in sunny San Diego, not snow-swept Dundee
yesterday.
The America's Cup is being staged in California, and Smith,
aggressively sure of his pedigree, believes he should be steering one of
the contenders for the blue riband of yachting.
After all, he was an America's Cup skipper 12 years ago, at the age of
24. Now, with six world titles in various classes to his name, two
Olympic appearances, and America's Cup and Whitbread Round-the-World
campaigns behind him, he is Britain's most experienced all-round sailor,
a charismatic figure who commands fierce loyalty.
The trouble is, however, that you need megabucks to launch a challenge
-- $70m last time, $25m this time. ''I can't get anyone to put up that
sort of money, and I'm not interested in going without being
competitive. You need to build two boats, run two crews -- 40 people at,
say #20,000. That's #800,000 a year in wages alone.''
The cynic in him surfaces: ''Even then it is all aggro, on and off the
boat. Either the boat is not right, the rules are not right, or the
prize money is not paid. It's for very rich people, and it is quite
glamorous -- but it always ends in court. Only a few specialists, and
New Zealanders, where sailing is a huge sport, really understand what is
going on. But ordinary folk can relate to Ultra racing. It gets far more
TV coverage, and is far more enjoyable.
''I used to be driven by the America's Cup, but not now, though I
wouldn't mind being involved next time.''
''Why? Because there's the possibility of teams being restricted to
$10m. On that basis, I have already got a company searching for a
backer. It disappoints me there is no British challenge this time. But I
can't be doing with touting myself round boardrooms. Yes, I admit
raising sponsorship is not my strong suit.''
He would rather be raising the sails.
I recalled being with Smith during a stop-over in the 1990 Round the
World race, at a pre-race party in Fort Lauderdale's exclusive Pier 66.
The rich and famous were getting their kicks, vying to be seen with the
dashing blond skipper.
Tables groaned under silver salvers of salmon, sweet chicken kebabs,
peppered goulash, and fist-sized strawberries. Tom Cruise dopplegangers
juggled bottles and glasses, Cocktail style. Multi-million real estate
was moored alongside, quayside umbilicals pumping aboard electricity,
water, and fuel, along with the Hang Seng and Wall Street prices. Gin,
Martini, and vintage champagne too, one suspected.
''Thankfully, there is not too much of this,'' said Smith, nodding at
the vapid females in their $3000 dresses.
Recalling it, he confessed: ''Well, you have to look after the
sponsors, give them what they want, not make life boring.''
Because of his self-confessed deficiency, he has sometimes found
himself ashore when inferior sailors, but better marketing men, landed
big sponsorships. He is not slow to give his views.
Peter Blake sailed Steinlager II ahead of Smith to victory in the
Whitbread Round-the World race. But it was all down to money, purchasing
the best technology, which Smith's backers could not match.
''Blake could not sail his way out of a paper hat,'' insists Smith.
''If there were 20 kids out there racing Lasers,'' he nods to the
snow-swept Tay, ''then Blake would be last. He'd probably even admit
it.''
Fourth in the 1988 Olympics, and third in Barcelona, has not cured
this professional of amateur sailing. ''I may go for the Star class in
Atlanta, mount a serious campaign, if I can get motivated, though it is
hard to justify when it costs money rather than makes it.
''But it is the kind of sailing I love. It's like this Vauxhall Ultra
series. The boats are all the same. You don't need a backer with a
bottomless chequebook.''

WE sit at the end of a big table, the atmosphere tense, expectant. He
is on my left, the folder in front of him. Perhaps it is 3in thick in
its cheap cover of buff card. If I stretched out my hand I could touch
it, or him.
A cup of coffee cools beside me.
''Why was the post-mortem in Inverness, not Aberdeen?''
There is nothing sinister to that, I am told; if it is not invariable
practice to have the post mortem in the district of incident -- even
when the actual death occurred many miles away -- it is generally
common.
''What's the precise point of the wound on the head?'' I ask. ''You
see, McRae's death certificate just says 'Gunshot wound on head', which
is obvious and unhelpful . . .''
I expect a verbal reply -- some part of the skull named -- but instead
the folder is being thumbed open. A little book of photographs now
manipulated. Something is shoved in front of me. A finger stabs.
I swallow. It is the head, the dead head in profile of Willie McRae,
bare in the flash-photo. The hair is lank, the eyes closed. He is very
white. His lips are parted. On his right temple -- pointed out by the
kindly finger -- is a scorched black hole, round and small.
Contact, I am told; of course, a contact wound cannot preclude
homicide, but it strongly favours suicide. The file is quoted.
''Presence of much powder debris in the wound is typical of contact . .
.''
I know what I am looking for; I have been studying gunshot wounds for
weeks. In a handgun suicide, with a shot to the head, there are three
classic sites of ''election''. The mouth, like Adolf Hitler. The dead
centre of the forehead (the site so typically symmetrical that any
deviation should arouse great suspicion). And the right temple --
whether the person was right-handed or not, writes Professor C K
Simpson.
I study the photograph. A contact wound on the skull, I think, should
be ''stellate'' -- a torn, ragged star of a wound, because the skin is
torn by a blowback of gases from the shot. This wound is rather too
round. But if it is not a contact wound, then how is there ''much powder
debris'' in the bullet-track? I see no sign of powderburn. Though the
dead man's head appears grubby -- especially his ear, which looks sooty,
and the hair above it -- there is no blistering to the skin, no singeing
of hair. While I must check my books later -- and the round hole does
look overneat -- I agree that this appears to be a contact wound.
McRae died, then, of a gunshot wound from a side-arm whose muzzle was
pressed against his right temple?
''Where was the wound found?'' At Forresterhill -- the Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary. Something is murmured about a nurse clearing clotted blood.
That would explain the difficulty other investigators have had, of
finding the clever doctor; this was a collective effort -- suspicious
nurse, X-rays, consultation and agreement.
''How many bullets were found in his head?'' Only one. I glimpse two
photographs: some red, jellied mass (the clot?) and a squashed, mangled
little bullet on bluish cloth, with a rule for scale.
''But why not at Inverness?'' Think about it. You bring this chap in
-- he's deeply unconscious. His breathing begins to deteriorate. It's a
serious head injury and you don't waste time. You get the man to
Aberdeen as quickly as possible. (Aberdeen, of course, is the standard
destination for all major head injuries in the north-east of Scotland.)
''How long did McRae survive the shooting?'' The folder is being
leafed through. He died at least 24 hours after wound was inflicted. The
next question is very important.
''Was there any evidence of nitrates, gunpowder residue, metals or
whatever on McRae's right hand?'' I know, in all probability, McRae was
washed and washed again before he died. Nevertheless, some evidence of
such material could well have remained on his hand -- if he had fired
the gun. Nails would have been scraped, skin swabbed, sleeve examined,
tested. Even if he had been washed, powder particles could have been
imbedded in his skin; his clothing would not have been washed. And if
such were found, and linked to the gun, then you would have real
evidence of suicide.
It was not checked, I am told. For the first time I sense
embarrassment. Incredulous, I ask again. But it is true. Dr Henry
Richmond, forensic pathologist, investigating a gunshot victim, did not
check the hands or clothing of his cadaver, did not look for what,
self-evidently, would be positive evidence for suicide and against
homicide.
''Were there any injuries on McRae's body consistent with car
accident?'' This question is to establish whether McRae was indeed in
the car when it crashed. (Many forget, examining the history, that the
crash and shooting may be two entirely separate incidents). Again, pages
fly. The assertion cannot be made . . . no . . . yes . . . some minor
bruises.
Big help, I think, but do not say. If McRae was in the car when it
crashed, wearing a seat-belt -- and it was a big Volvo, the car of
choice to crash in -- then merely sustaining minor bruising is quite
believable. But, equally, he could have been bruised -- almost certainly
was -- when David Coutts and company jerked and dragged his comatose
body from the wreck. It is highly probable that McRae was in the car
when it crashed; there are no injuries to confirm it. (In hindsight,
when it is too late, I wish I had asked about specific seatbelt bruising
on the shoulder.)
''What was the degree of alcohol, or other unusual substances, found
in McRae's body or in his bloodstream on arrival at Raigmore Hospital?''
The answer comes at once -- and again, with evident unease. No blood
was taken until after the PM -- the post mortem. My astonishment plainly
discomfits. But the answer is confirmed. And, at the post mortem, no
alcohol was found in McRae's bloodstream -- or anything else.
So I am expected to believe that, at Raigmore, care personnel
presented with a comatose man, his head bloody and injured, whose
breathing was increasingly laboured, failed to take an elementary
clinical step -- to check his bloodstream for alcohol or drugs that
could be depressing his vital functions; a check which, even with 1985
technology, could have been done in minutes. Assuming, of course, that I
am being told the truth. And the post mortem reading is negative.
In other words -- while bearing in mind that the post mortem was
conducted perhaps 48 hours after the shooting, ample time for even a
very drunk man to process alcohol -- and if the gunshot wound affected
the process at all, it would slow it -- there is no real evidence, no
evidence at all, that McRae was drunk when he was driving, when the car
crashed, or when the bullet smashed into his brain.
The next question is distasteful, but important. ''Was there any
evidence of regular alcohol abuse found in McRae's body?'' Thumb, thumb,
flick. Yes . . . there was enlargement. Organs were enlarged. ''The
liver?'' Yes -- hushed tones. (Some minutes later, more boldly, it is
revived, made specific. Multi-lobular enlargement . . .)
So he drank too much. I do not, however, forget the distinction --
sometimes fine, but critical -- between a heavy drinker and a hopeless
alcoholic. And there is still no evidence that McRae was drunk on the
night he ploughed off the road and was shot.
I remember Busby and Dinsmore. ''Was McRae under MI5 or Strathclyde
Special Branch surveillance?'' Strathclyde Special Branch positively
asserted he was not. As for the cars described by Busby and Dinsmore --
that was their mischief, it is alleged. These cars had shadowed Busby
and Dinsmore. And they were Special Branch vehicles. So, in a neat move,
the aspiring terrorists noted their details and later asserted that the
vehicles had trailed McRae. But (big smile) in April 1985 neither car
was a Special Branch car.
I scribble this down.
A good question now. ''What was the handgun? Scott and McLeay say it's
a Smith &amp; Wesson .45, which I find rather incredible . . . I'd have
thought a gun of that calibre would've blown McRae's head off . . .''
Flip, shove. I am looking at another photograph. A silvery revolver,
lying on a bed of moorgrass. A pearl handle. Another photo. This time it
is further from the camera, lying on the ground, looking discoloured --
mud? rust? Neither photo shows anything for scale -- not even a box of
matches.
It is, I learn, a .22 Smith &amp; Wesson, 7-chambered, top hinge, external
hammer, pearl-handled revolver. I am told, jocularly, it is a lady's
gun. ''What was the ammunition?'' Short cartridges. ''How many shots had
been fired?'' Two. ''Was there any trace of the other bullet?'' None.
And yes, it was the gun that killed McRae. Speculation: a test shot
fired in the air, then a shot to the head -- indicative of suicide. No
trace of second spent bullet. An empty cartridge box was found in car.
(I should have asked if all the chambers in the gun were loaded, apart
from the two fired cartridges. It seems reasonable to assume they were.)
''How old was the gun?'' Not known. It could be assumed it was fairly
elderly. Scott &amp; McLeay date it to ''1948, if not earlier'' -- but then,
they got the calibre wrong. ''Did McRae own it?'' Ronnie Welsh had
stated that he did, that he had seen the gun in McRae's office. A safe
is mentioned. ''Did he habitually carry it with him?'' Yes, according to
friends. (They are not named.)
''Did he hold a firearms certificate?'' No. And he was a solicitor,
says the voice, in a play of shock-horror. That McRae could have been
debarred from practice for carrying an unlicensed gun hangs in the air.
But there is another side to that: there is no proof, apart from the
testimony of Ronnie Welsh at the time, that McRae ever had this gun.
Welsh has vanished. The ''friends'' are not named. There is no
documentary evidence. (A few minutes later I am told different: the gun
was usually in McRae's office. Said who? Welsh.)
Back to the gun in a minute, but first, ''What was the car?'' A Volvo
244 -- and more photographs, pushed over, flipped through. I stand up
for a better look. I peer closely. I scribble some more.
It is a maroon Volvo, and its site is bizarre in the long shots from
the road -- roughly parallel to it, clearly pointing back to Invergarry,
and as it were parked -- I can think of no better word -- along the line
of a burn. The famous burn is an exaggeration.
It is so narrow it is barely a drain. The Volvo appears to straddle
it, leaning to the offside -- the angle rather less than 45 degrees;
perhaps 30%. But the onside wheels may actually be in the burn; it is
hard to tell. You could believe that the car had been driven along the
line of the drain and drawn to a halt. The effect is almost comic.
I am allowed to look at the photos with some leisure, though we are
pushed for time. I note the number -- FGB 214X. It is plain, looking at
the view from the lay-by, that you could not readily have seen a man in
the driver's seat -- unless you clambered down for close inspection. The
car is damaged enough -- buckled, dented. A photo now close-up, of the
driver's side. The door is a little open and jammed into the ground. It
is hard to see how they pulled McRae out. The onside headlamp is hanging
off. ''Is the driver's window wound down or smashed?''
Smashed, I am told. The damage is listed: bumper, light, rear
windscreen, driver's window broken or shattered. Roof buckled. All doors
buckled. No -- when I ask -- there was no broken glass on the road.
Nevertheless -- though it is a Volvo -- it does not strike me as a car
that left the road at great speed. I eye the terrain in the photos. It
is boggy, grassy, lumpen; but I see no obvious rocks. There is a peaked
knoll behind the car, looking from the lay-by; Loch Loyne is just
visible beyond. I think I would know the site if I saw it.
I asked for a grid reference, I am reminded. File checked: it is
rattled forth. Sheet 34, 21 95 80 66. This I note. It doesn't sound like
an Ordnance Survey grid number to me, but it may make sense to somebody.
''How far was the car from the road?'' Again, papers are checked.
Eighty-seven feet from carriageway. Feet? Feet. So much for ''one
hundred yards'' -- the standard description.
Now to the gun. ''When was it found, and where?'' On April 7, from the
burn directly below where the driver's door had been. But -- again, the
note of abashment -- the car was no longer there. The Northern
Constabulary, I am told wearily, did not exactly cover themselves in
glory.
Most accounts claim the gun was found on Monday 8th. The car was
removed about midday on the 7th. Had I been sharper, I would have asked
if the gun was on hand for Dr Richmond's autopsy -- and if not, why not.
But I am being drowned in priceless material.
The siting of gun in relation to car is the crux of the case. I press
the point. But -- adamant that gun was found, under car, in pool, in the
burn. The car was over this pool and over a small waterfall. I am shown
a photograph. I am not quite sure why, because the picture is profoundly
unhelpful. The gun is not in the photograph. The car is not in the
photograph.
There is no damage apparent to the ground, nothing to show that car or
gun had ever been there.
For the first time, I wonder if I am being told a lie. But I say
nothing. ''Were there fingerprints on the gun?'' There were no
fingerprints. ''No fingerprints?'' Fact: no fingerprints were found on
the gun. ''That doesn't make sense.'' No: it does not.
If I am being told lies, such astonishing admissions rather convince
you of someone's veracity. For, if the gun had no fingerprints, we have
to believe that McRae shot himself and then calmly wiped the gun clean
-- absurd. Or that he shot himself wearing a glove, or using a cloth,
having cleaned the gun first -- almost as absurd. But no-one has ever
mentioned a glove. (Did Dr Slesser check his pulse at the wrist?) Or --
maybe someone shot McRae with the gun, perhaps wearing a glove, and
wiped the revolver clean afterwards.
None of this makes sense.
''So, if McRae shot himself -- as we're expected to believe -- how did
the gun get there?'' Well, he would have shot himself in the right
temple with his right hand, elbow leaning on the door -- perhaps out of
the window. And with the recoil, the gun would have jumped out and
fallen into the pool. Yes, his arm should have been hanging out when
found. Perhaps it was. There was so much interference with the scene . .
.
Alternatively, he shot himself and the gun fell to his lap -- or to
his feet -- and, when Coutts and the rest of them were hauling him out,
it was dragged out with him and fell, unnoticed, into the burn. You see,
nobody was looking for a gun then . . . nobody knew he'd been shot . . .
The trouble is, looking at the photographs, there wasn't the space
between car and ground for gun to slither into burn. The car was leaning
on the driver's side. The door was tugged open only a few inches before
wedged firmly in turf. And it was a bright, silvery gun. I must say I am
not convinced. It might have dropped, so; but to reach the burn it must
have been kicked, or (deliberately?) shifted. Could it have fallen from
the car when it was being towed off on Sunday afternoon?
David Coutts claims to have seen photos of the scene with an X -- some
distance from the car -- marking the spot where the gun was found. I
mention this. I am told that the photos present may not be complete.
David Coutts also claimed, of course, to have seen right under the car
and spotted no gun. Is this true? First, picking up a cap -- even beside
a car on a street -- I don't think you would naturally stoop so low as
to view the ground right under the vehicle. Second, I don't see how --
seeing the photos -- that Coutts could have seen space or daylight
beneath the Volvo 244.
Was the gun ever in the car at all?
An explanation is now being given about the famous pile of papers.
What things there were were found uphill of the car -- towards the road.
They would simply have fallen out, as the Volvo rolled and tumbled --
and it certainly rolled, judging by the buckled roof. Plenty windows
busted. Stuff could have fallen from the parcel shelf, or the passenger
seat of the car -- where many a driver keeps personal things to hand.
This is the line I am being given.
What about the famous missing effects? McRae's briefcase. McRae's
cigarettes. The famous #100 note, the first McRae had ever received, and
which he kept by him as a talisman?
A list appears, of all McRae's belongings, as found on him, in the
car, or strewn about the moor, and duly collected by the Northern
Constabulary. I stand up and look at it. It mentions no fewer than two
briefcases -- one small, brown leather; one black attache case, rather
larger. And a cream-and-tan shopping bag.
I scan the list quickly. It includes a bewildering assembly of
identifying papers -- chequebooks, two American Express cards, cheque
guarantee card, library cards, debating union membership cards,
certificate of driving competency, SNP membership card, bank
certificates with a Chinese name -- I count, quickly, 20 such items in
all. I note the whisky -- one half-consumed half-bottle of Famous
Grouse. (This, Michael Strathern has told me, was not McRae's usual
brand.)
I note the clothing McRae wore. I do not recall seeing spare clothing
for a weekend on the list, nor toilet articles; but, of course, he may
have had plenty put by in his Dornie cottage. The voice remarks that
these do not look like the usual things for a weekend.
There is no mention of cigarettes. Most accounts of the mystery
suggest -- or imply -- that these items were missing when McRae was
found. In fact, it was McRae's sister-in-law -- according to Strathern
-- who missed them when all his effects were returned, at length, by the
authorities; and she was referring to, as far as Strathern knows, the
cigarettes and the #100 note, not the briefcases. ''It's possible that
the fags were simply pilfered. And the banknote . . .''
That would come as no surprise, says the voice. It does happen, the
stealing of non-traceable items. (But -- whatever McRae usually did --
no-one can confirm that he had the #100, nor vast quantities of Gold
Flake, with him that night.) Was there any internal probe after this
case? He does not know.
Who started the tale of the missing briefcase? (The contents of
briefcases found are listed: apart from ''various documents, papers'',
there is nothing to support the notion of secret files or a budding
book). I look at the list carefully. There is money. McRae had, with
him, ''14 x #10'' in banknotes, and ''9 x #1'' -- #149 in total. All
found intact. It doesn't fit in with someone looting the scene
afterwards, I am told -- unless the thief (murderer?) was highly
incompetent.
I have put all my questions but one. ''Was McRae a homosexual?'' There
was gossip to that effect, is the hushed reply. (I think that there is
gossip to that effect about all aging bachelors. There is no proof that
McRae was homosexual by nature, or practised homosexual vice, and the
smear should be buried until some proof or witness surfaces.)
The questions are over. Now the hypotheses. Homicide is gently
ridiculed. If someone was in the car with McRae, that person would have
crashed with him. He would then have had to get out of the car (though
the passenger door was buckled -- jammed?), get round to McRae's side,
shoot him -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere -- and
then, somehow, leave the scene, having wiped the gun clean of
fingerprints. It is at least six miles from the site to the nearest
habitation.
A sniper on the hill, waiting for McRae? In the dark? Shooting at a
moving car with a .22 pop gun, and every chance of shooting at the wrong
car? He'd have died of frostbite -- a cackle. The casual thief -- who
panicked, then shot McRae with his own gun? How did he get there? How
did he get away? How did he miss all that cash?
Another driver coming along? But how would he have seen the car down
there?
The official picture is painted.
* * *
McRAE had a drinking problem. He had two drunk-driving convictions,
faced charges for a third. He was prone to depression, and was terrified
of going to prison. He had spoken of this fear to his brother, Dr Fergus
McRae, and to Ronnie Welsh. Dr Fergus, I am told, had to watch out for
Willie quite frequently -- he was prone to instability, to trouble. On
the night of Friday, April 5, 1985, both men were very concerned about
Willie McRae. Welsh rang repeatedly ''up the track'' trying to get McRae
and car stopped.
McRae was on his way to ''Camusty'' to take his own life, rather than
face shame and prison. He did not carry the usual things for a weekend;
rather, he loaded himself -- deliberately -- with identifying papers,
assorted personal memorabilia. No doubt he was drinking as he drove. On
your charitable view, perhaps he was tired and dozy. He'd been shaken by
a fire the night before.
After Invergarry, he was further wearied -- perhaps goaded -- when he
had to stop and deal with a puncture. Assume -- be kind -- he wasn't
drunk; take your suggestion, that, descending the A87 towards the
junction, he nodded off at the wheel . . .
Crash, rolling, bumping, shaking -- in the pitch night; the confusion,
and the terror. The car has stopped. He must get out! He must get away
-- perhaps he is drunk, and knows it; perhaps he fears what the police
will make of the gun if they catch an uncertificated sidearm on him. He
tries to get out, but he cannot; he is trapped in his car, trapped on
the moor in the night.
No good waiting for ''Camusty . . .''
He finds and loads the gun, fires a test-shot into the dark.
Willie McRae shoots himself . . .
The gun falls.
Subsequent bungling, makes effective investigation impossible; family
grief renders a Fatal Accident Inquiry inhuman . . .
There is a long silence.
I ask, again, to see the photograph of McRae's head. It is readily
produced. It does look like a contact wound. That could be soot about
his ear, from the firing of the little gun close by, or perhaps from the
fire in his bathroom.
He looks utterly alone.
I leave.
* * *
LET us assume that everything you have just read is true. And continue
on the assumption with which I left this meeting -- the assumption,
indeed, with which I began this investigation -- that, hard as it was to
accept, Willie McRae did indeed take his own life.
True, I was doubtful about the wound. Why was it round rather than
stellate? But I check my books. And, according to Professor A K Mant
(Taylor's Principles and Practice of Forensic Medicine, 1965, 1984) it
fits. ''If the gases are not of sufficient volume, ie 0.22 calibre
rifle, or the propellant has deteriorated, there may not be sufficient
pressure to cause this type of close-contact wound and the wound will
remain circular although in other respects it follows the criteria for a
close contact wound.''
That little, old ladies' revolver: it makes perfect sense. Dr Henry
Richmond was right. But a contact wound is not proof of suicide.
Furthermore, according to Professor J K Mason (Forensic Medicine for
Lawyers, 1978, 1983), ''The examining doctor should always confer with
the police officer in charge as to the presence of spent cartridges; the
firing of more than one shot is uncommon in suicide.''
Still, ignore those two points. How credible is the explanation
advanced for suicide in this case? A doctor confirms that
''multi-lobular enlargement'' of the liver is almost certain proof of
''alcohol liver disease'' -- consistent with long-term heavy drinking.
As a psychiatrist, he finds the suicide hypothesis ''not incredible''.
Knowing Raigmore, he is ''suprised'' the blood alcohol was not checked,
but reminds me it is a decade ago and these things have been tightened
up.
And there is no proof at all that McCrae was homosexual. Nor that he
was drunk the night he crashed. Suddenly I remember a Scottish peer,
repeatedly convicted of drunk driving -- five times but never jailed.
My doubts are growing.
Yes, the explanation for the ''pile of papers'' is believable. But
what about the discovery of the gun? I visualise those photos of the
stranded Volvo. I am certain that the onside wheels were on the bank --
not in the burn. And -- because the car was leaning to that side -- I
don't think there was physical space for the gun even to have slidden
beneath the car.
I recall pictures of the gun. Photo of pool where it was allegedly
found -- but no sign of gun, car, or marks of either. Another photo now
recalled -- a bad, blurry one -- a hand holding gun (bagged over a patch
of burn. But was it the same patch? And, even if it was, what does that
prove? Nothing.
Was McRae really trapped in the car? Witnesses say his seatbelt was
off. The driver's window was smashed. And the car was upright . . .
Surely he wasn't so fat that he couldn't crawl out . . .
I suddenly realise how many things are assumed. Nothing missing from
the car -- if authorities could be sure they were first on the scene.
Not the usual things for a weekend . . . if McRae was, indeed, planning
to spend the weekend at ''Camusty''. But what if he had simply dashed up
to fetch something? What, in fact, if he had been on his way back? Yes,
the car could simply have been turned lengthwise in course of the crash.
But its position also fitted -- better? -- McRae driving south . . .
I examine my notes -- and spot a bizarre inconsistency. ''He died at
least 36 hours after wound was inflicted.'' What?! But McRae died at
3.30am on Sunday morning . . . which, if this is to be believed, means
he was shot no later than 3.30pm on Friday afternoon.
McRae was a tough, formidable lawyer. Being rational, would he really
have been frightened by legal proceedings? He'd have known never to
assume the worst possible scenario. He could have said he'd lost the
firearm certificate . . . confiscated weapon from unstable client . . .
admitted to drink problem, but covered himself in contrition, booked in
for drying out, obtained glowing reports of his progress from doctors .
. . if he had been rational. What evidence is there really that he was
not rational -- depressed, unstable?
Precious little . . .
Ronnie Welsh said he owned the gun. Ronnie Welsh said McRae was
depressed. Ronnie Welsh said he had spoken of prison, of suicide. Ronnie
Welsh was to hand when McRae's ventilated corpse was unplugged . . .
Welsh, Welsh, Welsh . . . who has completely disappeared; who, despite
all Herald inquiries, does not seem to have been seen by a living soul
for seven years.
It all hinges on where that gun was found. And I think now in terms
not of logic, but of impressions -- the feel I had, for an hour, of
another human being. Pictures and papers pressed upon me. Incredible
admissions. Happy confirmation of repeated blunders. But, on this
essential point, adamant -- and not a shred of proof presented.
I felt it even then -- I was not being told the truth. Logically,
three possibilities: source knew they were not telling the truth
(lying); source did not know they were not telling the truth (in
circumstances of meeting, improbable); source afraid they were not
telling the truth (so deliberately had not checked).
Suddenly, I can no longer take anything I was told -- perhaps even saw
-- on trust. Immediately, I despatch two faxes -- one to confirm
accurate notes of two assertions from source. The reply is relayed --
positive. The second fax is to The Herald. I want certain things checked
by a trained, hardheaded reporter.
For there is no real evidence of suicide -- only circumstantial
evidence. Ignore a hypothesis that conveniently fits the facts -- one of
which, in any event, I am now certain was a lie. There is no proof.
And there ethics come in. As a Gael, I find suicide repellent -- ''the
ghost of the suicide walks, cursed . . .'' As a Christian, I regard
suicide as wicked. If I am ever found shot, dying, in my car, I would
want it to be a nice clean murder. And I am not going to accuse a dead,
defenceless bachelor of such a heinous act without overwhelming
evidence, which I have not been given.
I wait . . .
The first breakthrough: the grid reference number is checked. It is
nonsensical. Sheet 34 is a standard Ordnance Survey Landranger map. For
such, an eight-digit number -- 21 95 80 66 -- is meaningless. So we
check . . . and, according to this, Willie McRae was found about a mile
southwest of Spean Bridge, 20 miles perhaps from Loch Loyne, well off
the A87, and in the middle of woods! It takes us a day to sort it out.
If we remove the first and last digits, we get 19 58 06.
Then, we make a little adjustment. We twiddle the last three digits.
And that gives us 19 50 68. Which -- as we already know -- is the grid
reference for the official memorial cairn to Willie McRae, by the banks
of Loch Loyne.
Whoever recorded this mangled number was incompetent. And my informant
is now confirmed as incompetent, dishonest or both.
There is only one way to finally verify the site. I leave Edinburgh
immediately. Four hours later, I have walked into my photographs -- in
the teeth of sluicing sleet and rain. The memorial cairn -- if not a
precise mark -- is, in the immortal words of the fellow who removed
McRae's car, as ''near as dammit''. I find the burn, the pool, the
waterfall. I verify this as the site I viewed in the photographs. I
attest that it is much nearer the road than widely reported in the past.
Inspecting the ground, the positioning of the car can be accepted
whatever the original direction of travel. And -- carefully -- I inspect
the tiny, gurgling, frothing burn, the little pool with the waterfall.
The rain, which has been coursing throughout my drive, deigns to stop.
I clamber up to the road and leave.
* * *
THE second breakthrough: we find the copper, the policeman first on
the scene. And -- we can scarcely believe it -- the same officer who,
the following day, found the revolver in the burn. Kenny Crawford still
only in his thirties, has spoken entirely freely to The Herald. There is
every reason to believe he is telling the truth. He can have nothing to
gain, nothing to prove, by his insistent testimony that he found the gun
''some yards downstream''.
Crawford has also insisted that, nevertheless, he believes ''it was
knocked from a ledge in the car'' when McRae's body was recovered; and
that, having fallen into the burn, the current must have swept the Smith
&amp; Wesson downstream.
I might acidly remark that it says little for Scottish journalism that
this vital witness, whom my colleague readily found within 48 hours, has
been unknown and untraced for 10 years.
Now here is a very important point. In a court of law, Crawford's
speculations -- sincere as they appear to be -- would be entirely
inadmissible. He could only attest to what he had personally witnessed.
And what he witnessed -- what he surely reported at the time, what was
surely conveyed to the authorities, what must be in the secret Crown
Office records -- is one fact alone: that the gun was found several
yards from the final position of Mr McRae's car. And from that point the
authorities were surely engaged on a murder inquiry.
For suicide cannot be sustained on the fact of a gun several yards
from McRae's car, a gun with no fingerprints whatever.
Mason's Forensic Medicine for Lawyers, 1984 edition, describes the
Scots law which surely applied at the time of McRae's death. ''Should
the Fiscal decide, or should he accept the advice of a police surgeon,
that a post-mortem dissection is required, he will seek the authority of
the Sheriff . . . The dissection is carried out by two doctors whenever
the circumstances give grounds for suspicion or suggest the possibility
that criminal proceedings may follow; it is only necessary for one
pathologist to give evidence in Court.''
Assume that McRae's autopsy was conducted after the discovery of the
gun -- entirely possible. Assume that gun, history and description of
scene were available to Thomas Aitchison, procurator-fiscal, and Dr
Henry Richmond, Inverness pathologist. And then two things become clear
as daylight. First: there must have been a second doctor attending the
dissection. Who was he? And what was his expertise?
Second: take back any aspersions on Dr Richmond. For -- if he was able
to dissect McRae after receiving an accurate history -- he would
properly have felt no need at all to swab the right hand. Not to have
done so -- simply on the excuse the hand had been repeatedly washed --
could, I am told, amount to great incompetence. But, on this scenario,
it makes perfect sense. Richmond would have been certain he was dealing
with a homicide -- that McRae's hand never fired the gun.
And who else for 10 years, off the record, has been softly,
persuasively, subtly belittled by a high and anonymous tongue.
An instance -- McRae was alive when found; therefore -- assuming, as
it appears, that PC Crawford was so advised when he reached the scene
that Saturday morning -- then the officer's behaviour is entirely
defensible. His duty, at that point, was not to rope off the scene and
preserve perfect forensic order. He felt properly obliged to assist in
getting a seriously injured man to hospital as quick as possible.
I am suddenly very angry.
Still so many unanswered questions! You'd like to know about the car
-- were the lights switched on? Was it in gear? What caused the
puncture? Why was the spare wheel on the back seat and not in the
Volvo's capacious boot? How is everyone so sure that McRae never reached
Dornie, that he was not in fact returning? How do you explain the
discrepancy between Richmond's assertion on ante-mortem injury timing
and the known history of McRae's last days?
Why did the Nationalists abandon this case, repudiate this man? Why
did his own family not push for an inquiry? What worse could have been
said, or found, about McRae that has not hitherto surfaced? How could
they let him lie these 10 years in a suicide's grave?
The evidence is overwhelming. Now deal with Crawford's hopeful
speculation -- which would not be sought in a court of law. I do not,
having seen the site and examined the evidence, believe that gun could
have been shifted as he thinks. I was there on a wet, wet day -- the
hills awash, the rivers full with snowmelt and rain. But this is a tiny
burn. And the pool, though very small, is scooped, hollow, the bottom
rimmed with rock. The ''waterfall'' at most is 2ft (and by my
recollection less). I am certain it is the pool I saw in the gunless,
carless, photograph.
I do not believe that a small, heavy, pointy gun would have been
shifted by that little drain -- not even by the force of water I
observed on Friday. And water is all there would be. The hills above the
road are treeless, the burns are sluiced bare; this is, very nearly, the
wettest part of Scotland. There would be no branches, no flotsam to drag
and pull a revolver.
The car, almost certainly, was removed uphill. So it could not have
dragged an unseen gun downhill. And, from the photos I saw and well
recall, I simply do not believe a bright silver revolver could have
fallen, unseen, from McRae's hands, clothing or feet as he was hauled
from the car -- under full view, it appears, of five people. And if it
had, it would not have fallen into the burn.
A revolver yards away, with no fingerprints.
A reconstruction could be done with another revolver in that burn, but
I am, beyond reasonable doubt, quite certain.
Willie McRae was murdered.
* * *
I AM near the end of my story now. I have left many a question for
later investigation. But I believe I have here established a compelling
argument -- having begun this search convinced (reluctantly) of suicide
-- that Willie McRae died not by his own hand, but that of another.
I have concerned myself entirely with facts of body, scene, history.
Others may speculate on theories of conspiracy. Colleagues have made out
a plausible case that McRae was murdered for nuclear secrets. With all
respect to a fine reporter, I am highly sceptical. There is no proof he
had such material that night, nor is an assassin named. I am not
satisfied with off-the-record allegations. Nor does a shot from an
elderly silly little gun, taking perhaps 24-hours to kill its target,
support the idea of a coldblooded and professional hit.
My hunch -- and the evidence of the wound -- is that Willie McRae was
killed by someone he knew and trusted, someone of whom he had no reason
to be afraid.
That there has been a conspiracy of another sort -- to cover up
incompetence, to mislead the public, to defame a dead man -- is,
however, apparent.
I now call for two things.
First, the revival of a police investigation into the murder of
William McRae. I can suggest an excellent place to start -- the
long-lost Ronnie Welsh. Welsh may well be dead. But his role in McRae's
death -- and in establishing the evidence on which authorities proceeded
-- demands, at least, that he be located, if only to be eliminated from
inquiries. My own tentative investigations suggest a plausible motive.
Second: a full Public Inquiry is now essential. I demand it, and so
should every rational Scot. The Lord Advocate has power to order the
procurator-fiscal to hold an inquiry ''expedient in the public
interest'' into a death ''sudden, suspicious or unexplained, or has
occurred in circumstances such as to give rise to serious public
concern.'' I submit that this is now manifestly apparent.
The facts support only two hypotheses: unbelievable incompetence at
the highest levels in Highland investigating authorities, or a
calculated and cynical cover-up of, at least, such incompetence. For the
sake of all individuals and offices involved, so that our rule of law in
Scotland retains the public confidence, an inquiry is vital.
I appeal to McRae's family to reconsider their position on this. I ask
you all, each of you reading this essay, to press -- whatever your
station -- for a Public Inquiry into the death of Willie McRae.
* * *
I STAND and gaze to the snowdraped Cuillin Hills. I think of other
hills, three days ago, and of a lonely road, and a simple cairn.
Put a stone on that cairn when you pass by. I did, before I left. I
left rapidly. It is not a spot where you care to linger.

ODD that an ecclesiastical fantasy about an eccentric
whiter-than-white pope and part-time misanthrope should have proved one
of the great West End hits of the late-sixties, propelling the career of
Alec McCowen into orbit in the process.
Odd in general, I suppose, that the least likely subjects can make the
most engaging theatrical material. And Peter Luke's play is that rare
combination of intelligence and accessibility, moral debate, and
scathing wit that creates an unexpectedly absorbing night at the
theatre.
Hadrian VII is built around a gift of a lead role, the McCowen part
being played here with effortless charm and deft technical grace by
Derek Jacobi in this Chichester Festival Theatre touring production.
Hadrian, otherwise known as Fr.
William Rolfe is a great stage character, a thwarted priest and
self-proclaimed religious maniac, alive with human contradictions, even
while he is pursuing his moral absolutes with unwavering singularity.
His very absolutism makes him both unbearable to live with and -- at
least in the extended fantasy that forms the bulk of the play -- the
ideal candidate for the new pontiff of Rome.
Luke's great skill in his stage adaptation of a semi-autobiographical
book by the original Fr Rolphe is to be irreverent -- ''Nothing stinks
like the odour of sanctity,'' says Hadrian on reaching the Vatican --
without ever being blasphemous, and to explore social, spiritual, and
moral values without any of the worthiness easily associated with
religious drama.
Terry Hands's large-cast production has the stark simplicity of studio
theatre, with its stripped-back set and crisp lighting design, bringing
an intimacy and immediacy, not to mention a sharp sense of humour, to
this fascinating and rewarding play.

SCOTTISH Friendly has also just launched its first new product since
its incorporation -- the Scottish Investment Bond. It is a single
premium, unit-linked investment plan designed for longer term returns
and comes with a minimum investment of only #1000. It features a choice
of five funds: the Managed Fund, the UK Equity Fund, the Fixed Interest
Fund, the Cash Fund, and, most notably, the Scottish investment trusts
Fund. Uniquely, this specialist fund invests with top, existing funds
managed by Scottish investment trusts, allowing access to their
management expertise.
Scottish Friendly's own investment analysts monitor investment trust
performance, switching investments if required to maximise capital
growth.
The Bond is designed so investors can withdraw money regularly if
required. Although designed as a long-term plan, investors have easy
access to their money and there is no penalty for early cashing in.
Other flexible features include the ability to switch between funds and
the option of dividing the bond into a series of 10 identical policies.
The Scottish Investment Bond also offers a degree of life cover.
''The Scottish Investment Bond offers customer easy access to the
stock market returns accrued through our investment team's expertise but
with minimal risk,'' said Mr Gibb.
''The Bond gives us a product which links directly into stock market
returns and allows us to display to clients, on a daily basis, the
performance coming through from our investment team. The peformance of
each fund can be monitored by looking at the prices published daily in
The Herald.
''It also offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of the
outstanding track record of Scottish investment companies.''
And the good news is that customers applying for the Scottish
Investment Bond before May 1 will receive a 1% bonus on their
investment.

<HEADLINE>MPs look at future of Scottish agriculture SNH calls for development of a 'rural policy'</HEADLINE>

THE Common Agricultural Policy should be developed into ''something
which looks more like a rural policy,'' John Thomson, director of policy
with Scottish Natural Heritage, told a hearing of the Scottish Affairs
Committee in Glasgow yesterday.
The committee is currently taking evidence on the future for Scottish
agriculture.
''We believe that the subsidy which is being put in should be geared
to delivering a range of different objectives -- not just food
production,'' Mr Thomson told the committee.
In Environmentally Sensitive Areas, he said, SNH would like to see
some of the payments going to maintaining traditional features such as
dykes and hedges and wildlife habitats. One of the problems with rural
management, however, was a shortage of labour.
Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr, asked if nature itself didn't look after
habitats. ''That is what we would call agricultural abandonment, which
is not something we would favour as a rule,'' said Mr Thomson. ''A lot
of what is most valuable in the countryside is there because of human
intervention, and if you want to maintain it you have to continue with
human intervention.''
Committee chairman William McKelvey, MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun,
asked the SNH witnesses to define what was meant by sustainability. In
reply, Mr Thomson indicated that sustainability referred to the ability
of natural systems to maintain, in the future, levels of agricultural
production which were curently being achieved.
There were other, less quantifiable, contributions than simply food
production, he said. ''One of the products of agriculture is an
attractive, species-rich countryside.
''The more artificial inputs in a system, the more questionable it
must be how sustainable it is. If you are having to pump massive amounts
of fertiliser into the ground there must be a question as to how
sustainable that is in the longer term.''
The chairman also sought the SNH views on set-aside, commenting that
non-farmers might wonder ''why they should be paid for doing nothing and
producing nothing''.
Roger Crofts, chief executive of SNH, said they preferred the
longer-term set-aside schemes which gave an opportunity for active
management and benefits to the landscape and wildlife.
In general, he said, they favoured setting aside strips of land rather
than whole fields. That could allow for the growth of shrubs and trees
and the provision of ''buffer'' areas, minimising some of the run-off
into drains and ditches and providing wildlife habitats. Linking up of
strips could provide public access across farmland.
The idea of transferring headage payments from sheep to shepherds was
also put forward by Mr Crofts. Many of the problems SNH faced in
maintaining the natural heritage resulted from overgrazing, he said.
Sheep annual premium payments and hill livestock compensatory
allowances were both geared towards getting more sheep on the hill.
''What we are asking for is greater management on the ground. Livestock
isn't so spread over the hill as it was previously, when you had more
balanced grazing. Why should there not be a more positive payment to
ensure we have more shepherds on the hills?''
The chief executive, in response to further questioning by Mr Gallie,
said that he would be prepared to abolish sheep annual premium payments
and HLCAs in favour of some other method of payment. ''We would not want
to see less resources,'' he said. ''What we are looking for is viable
communities to look after the land, produce food and forestry.''
He questioned whether it was acceptable for government environmental
agencies to be making payments to counteract some of the effects of
various elements of the CAP. ''Would it not be better to have a much
more integrated approach?'' he asked.
The question of the re-introduction of wolves to Scotland was raised
by Mr McKelvey. Such a policy would not pass the required tests, said Mr
Crofts. Wolves would not have the impact on reducing the high numbers of
red deer that had been claimed, so the ecolological benefits were
doubtful.
SNH also had to take account of the views of local communities. ''We
are not pursuing a wolf introduction programme. It seems to be an idea
developed by particular bodies based furth of Scotland.''
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds also gave evidence at
yesterday's sitting. Questioned on the effects of over-grazing, Stuart
Housden, the society's director for Scotland, said that since the war
40% of the heather area in the Renfrew Hills had been lost through
excessive grazing by livestock. The number of sheep in Scotland had
remained constant at about 10 million but a huge amount of hill ground
had been given over to forestry, reducing the amount of land available
for sheep.
In their written submission the RSPB argued that the 1992 reforms to
the CAP were primarily designed to curb over-production and expenditure.
Environmental considerations were secondary.
The society supported the concept of cross-compliance -- making
agricultural payments conditional on achieving environmental goals. This
would make environmental objectives a central element of the CAP.
Despite making statements in support of the principle of
cross-compliance the Scottish Office had done very little to further its
development.

GIVEN the maturity of many of the UK's retail markets, coupled with
intense price competition which is placing severe downward pressure on
margins, it is not surprising that some of the larger High Street names
are looking to diversify to ensure future profits growth.
Yesterday, Marks &amp; Spencer announced that it plans to develop a chain
of stores in Germany and a representative office in China. It hopes to
have approval for the Chinese office by June which will support the
group's operations in Hong Kong and provide a base to evaluate the
Chinese market.
''With a population of 1200 million and an emerging middle-class the
opportunities for Marks &amp; Spencer are potentially huge,'' said deputy
chairman Keith Oates, who is also joint managing director for the
company's international operations. M&amp;S has seven stores in Hong Kong
and these had turnover last year of nearly #60m.
In addition, M&amp;S continues to assess opportunities in Italy but has
decided against opening stores in Japan at the present time. However, it
may still sell St Michael branded merchandise in Japan in the future.
''Development will follow the step-by-step formula which has been so
successful for us in other countries,'' said Mr Oates.
Yesterday's announcement is a logical extension of its overseas
presence. M&amp;S is rapidly building brand recognition worldwide. It
currently operates in much of northern Europe from its own stores and
has franchises in South-east Asia and southern European countries such
as Greece.
Three new stores have opened during the current financial year, two in
Paris and one in Valencia. When it comes to what people want to wear
there is a remarkable consensus at least across Europe. M&amp;S's investment
in retail systems will enable it to take advantage of this commonality
and sell the same stock as it sells in Britain.
M&amp;S is Britain's largest clothier with a market share of around 14%
but even so it cannot afford to become complacent. Indeed much of its
growth in recent times has been achieved on the back of the perceived
''outstanding value'' which its merchandise offers.
The group still has sizeable investment opportunities in the UK but
its overseas operations have been growing steadily and are now seen as a
key driver of future profits growth. Although its early days yet. In
1993-94, M&amp;S profits in Europe remained static at #27m in 1993-94. M&amp;S
is intent on changing its international image from that of a niche
retailer selling ''a little slice of Britain'' to a high-volume, big
player in Europe and east Asia.
M&amp;S is among a handful of stores groups (including Great Universal
Stores, Boots, Argos and Next) which generate a significant amount of
cash. It has moved from a position of having 28% gearing in 1989 to the
current modest net cash position.
It could either give this back to shareholders in the form of special
dividends, spend the money buying back its own shares or invest in
expanding the business. M&amp;S has chosen to increase its capital
expenditure although the extent of its cash generation should ensure a
progressive increase in dividends. The availability of quality sites is
a key issue in determining the extent of any store opening plans.
The overseas potential for M&amp;S is much larger than in the UK, albeit
it will be growing from a much lower base. Given the patchy acquisition
experience of M&amp;S in Brooks Brothers and Kings Super Markets in the US,
it is perhaps not surprising that it appears to be giving a priority to
investing in its core chain rather than going down the acquisition
trail.
British retailers have had a chequered history overseas and so the
City is understandably wary of grandiose expansion plans. However M&amp;S's
softly softly approach, coupled with its superior retailing skills,
should enable it to deliver the goods in terms of the bottom line.
Annual results, which will be published in May, are expected to show
as much as a 14% increase in underlying profitability in spite of
continued consumer caution both in the UK and in parts of Continental
Europe.

AFTER months of rumour, Scottish &amp; Newcastle has formally confirmed
that it is in talks with Foster's Brewing of Australia to buy its
Courage brewing subsidiary, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The Edinburgh-based company may acquire only part of Courage which has
a 19% share of UK beer production in addition to its existing 12% as
there are inherent regulatory problems whenever market share exceeds
25%.
Although S&amp;N stonewalled yesterday as to how much could be paid and
when, City analysts suggested the deal could be agreed in principle this
week with S&amp;N paying about #400m for the bulk of the Courage assets.
Any merger would be an almost perfect geographic fit and considerably
strengthen S&amp;N's presence in the southern half of England. It now seems
to have a clear run with Whitbread having withdrawn and instead deciding
to invest #85m by extending its highly-successful Brewers Fayre family
and food-orientated pub chain.
It is suggested that to meet possible Office of Fair Trading
requirements, S&amp;N would be prepared to pass on some Courage brewing
assets and brands to competitors. The Mortlake Brewery in London could
be sold to Anheuser-Busch of the US, the world's biggest brewer,
producing the Budweiser lager brand. There may have to be a shedding of
some of the licensed beers such as Hofmeister and Kronenbourg although
S&amp;N could acquire the European as well as UK rights to Foster's lager.
S&amp;N would be very anxious to obtain a rapid return on capital through
eliminating excess brewing capacity -- Courage has been forced to be a
leader in free trade price cuts because of its own problems in this
regard, particularly at Halifax and Reading.
S&amp;N eased 3p to 511p on turnover of 6.24 million shares, not too
concerned that there may have to be a rights issue to fund any purchase.

A CHAMPAGNE reception at 11 Downing Street yesterday was the icing on
the cake for Stirlingshire-based entrepreneur and mother-of-two Sarah
Gleave, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Having pioneered a new stencil technique of cake design in 1988,
Sarah's Creative Stencil Designs now supplies the worldwide
confectionery market, a supermarket chain, a home decorating supplier
and a do-it-yourself distributor.
As runner-up in the 1995 Women into Business Awards, sponsored by the
Small Business Bureau in association with Enterprise Money Mail, she was
presented with a #1000 cheque by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
The ceramic design graduate, who is based at Easter Poldar Farm at
Thornhill, also won an expenses-paid trip for two to Paris.
To cope with demand arising from the award, Sarah, who represented
Scotland at International Cake Exploration Society conferences in the US
in 1992 and 1993, will shortly increase her full-time workforce from
three to five.
Having originally imported stencils to her design and specification
from a US manufacturer, she now makes her own using a laser cutting
machine.
Sarah, who has written a number of specialist books, sells to an
impressive list of countries, including the US, Japan, Australia, Israel
and New Zealand. She is also developing a mail order business.
Stirling Enterprise business adviser Evelyn Paterson nominated her for
the award. Sarah received advice from the local enterprise company when
she started her company in 1991.

<TEXT>
THE recent weakness of sterling ''was no more than a wobble,'' said
Bank of England Goveror Eddie George yesterday.
However, ''the wobble'' showed little signs of abating yesterday with
sterling dropping 0.2 of its value on a trade-weighted basis to 85.4.
The pound had climbed higher against the German mark in early trading
but proved unable to retain the gains later on and slipped back over a
pfennig to DM2.2412. However, it benefited from a weak dollar and rose
almost a cent to $1.5985. The US currency weakened amid talk of selling
by US funds.
Although economic fundamentals remain fairly supportive, the uncertain
political backdrop is acting as a drag on the pound. If support at
DM2.24 gives way then the pound could be in for a freefall to new record
lows below DM2.1890.

THERE was some disappointment when property group Hammerson reported
only a 9.3% rise in net asset value to 375p last year against market
expectations of over 380p, writes CHRIS STONE.
This follows hard on the heels of Slough Estates which also
disappointed with its net asset value and raised worries about
constricting pressures on office rents.
Hammerson's profits though have soared over 64% to #545m after
stripping out the one-off gain from the sale of its Australian portfolio
last October. The final dividend is held at 6.5p a share to give a total
at 10p. Hammerson shares dipped 3p to 316p.
The group's improvement in revenue is put down to its strategy under
chief executive Ron Spinney of concentrating on Britain, the US and
Continental Europe and on retail property whose content of the overall
portfolio rose from 50% to 55% in 1994.
But office property in the UK, which started fairly sprightly at the
beginning of last year, has gone into the doldrums since. The chief
executive believes that rental income will recover towards the end of
the year but is likely to be tied to specific buildings or retail
complexes and certain geographic areas. However, the company is now
seeing increased demand for offices, especially in the West End and City
of London. There was a 2.1% rise in net rental income to #120.1m in
1994.
The value of Hammerson's UK offices increased by 3.9% last year, while
the value of its overseas office space fell 5.7%.

THE sentiment of housebuyers this spring will be important to
Alexander Russell, which yesterday reported an 80% leap in 1994 pre-tax
profits to #3.02m.
Having put the construction slump of the early nineties firmly behind
it, the Glasgow-based quarrying, concrete and coal group confidently
raised its total dividend by 43% to 2.5p, after a final payout of 1.5p.
The shares put on 1p to 91p.
Alexander Russell also made clear its intention of opening new
opencast coal sites, to take advantage of the post-privatisation market.
Managing director Graeme Nicolson believes the true state of the
housing market, a key one for Alexander Russell, will become clear
during the traditionally busy spring period.
He said: ''Statistics certainly don't look good in terms of numbers of
new starts but many of the customers we deal with seem to be optimistic
in the short term.''
Alexander Russell's coal division was the only cloud on the horizon in
the year to end-December.
With the market unsettled in the run-up to the sell-off of British
Coal, the company had to accept prices well below those paid for
imported supplies.
Consequently, it delayed the opening of its Easter Fortissat opencast
coal site near Shotts, which is now off to a profitable start.
With considerable development work and site investigations undertaken
during 1994, the coal division made a loss.
However, Mr Nicolson believes the likes of Mining (Scotland) will be
looking for better prices for marginal supplies and sees no need for the
massive premium paid for imported supplies.
The quarrying division, which accounts for about 60% of the business,
achieved a 44% increase in profits. Efficiency improvements and higher
selling prices more than countered a slip in demand for sand and gravel
in Scotland.
Increased turnover has moved the US quarry business into a profitable
state.
Profits in the concrete division were up 43%, even though margins in
roof tile, and block and pavior operations were tight. Orders for roof
tile machinery were received from Russia, Romania and India.
Overall, turnover was up just 6% at #38.2m, with fully-diluted
earnings per share up 99% to 6.65p.
There is ''cautious optimism'' at Alexander Russell, with 1995 trading
in line with expectations thus far.
The transfer of the company's plain tile plant from Lochmaben to
Burton-upon-Trent -- closer to customers in the south-east of England --
is now complete.
With borrowings cut by #3.5m, year-end gearing was reduced from 50% to
37%.

BUILDING products and security printing group Caradon boosted profits
52% from #132.2m to #201.2m, excluding one-offs in 1994.
Underlying operating profits were 24% ahead and margins rose from 8.9%
to 10.3%. A final dividend of 6.60p raises the total from 8.79p to
9.50p.
Caradon cut costs while at the same time managing to pass on its own
material cost increases which saw the price of aluminium and PVC rose
between 20% and 30%.
Successful cost reduction measures were a major feature of the
company's activities during the year and contributed to the result of
each division. There was a more difficult pricing environment than in
earlier years. But the company said: ''We achieved sale price increases,
broadly recovering raw material and other cost increases overall
throughout almost all our building products businesses.''

PEARSON'S step into the brave new world of interactive software with
last year's #312m purchase of Software Toolworks, now known as
Mindscape, has not made a very promising beginning.
Soon after the acquisition the bottom fell out of the video games
market when Nintendo and Sega promoted their own software. So Mindscape
has proven to be an expensive purchase, though it was a minor misfortune
for Pearson, given that it reported profits 43% ahead at #298m for 1994,
aided by one-off gains. Strip out the BSkyB contribution and operating
profits were a more modest 17% ahead.
Pearson managing director Frank Barlow said he had no regrets about
the purchase of Mindscape, pointing out yesterday that the acquisition
was made for the long-term and gave Pearson the second biggest operator
behind Microsoft in the US CD-ROM market, with a 12% share.
The market is exploding, with sales rising over threefold last year to
54,000,000 units. It is destined to be a much larger market than video
games. Mindscape's initial contribution was well below budget at #3.5m.
Mr Barlow said Mindscape was about a year behind schedule in terms of
its expected returns.
Pearson's profits from its 17.5% holding in BSkyB soared to #57.6m and
Thames TV also did well. The division is run by veteran TV executive
Greg Dyke and has various irons in the fire, notably a joint venture
with the BBC to run two European satellite channels which went live in
January. Profits are not expected until 1997 at the earliest. There is
also an application for Channel 5 in progress and a link with Hong Kong
has been forged.
Entertainment as a whole almost doubled profits to #129m. Penguin
books in its 60th year made more at #40m, with US hardbacks and trade
paperbacks offsetting destocking at home. Visitor attractions were up
despite spending on a Spanish attraction, with record attendances at
Alton Towers and Madame Tussauds.
Newspapers had profits up 41% at #84.7m, with the flagship Financial
Times immune from industry price-cutting, and benefiting from rising
advertising revenue from overseas. The paper is now to be printed in
seven foreign centres, starting with Sweden. Electronic business
information benefited from the integration of Extel, while Westminster
Press, the free newspapers company, recovered smartly. Les Echos in
France was hit by development spending but. The group has recently
acquired control of a leading Spanish newspaper publisher, Recoletos.
Rising newsprint costs are impacting on the industry and Pearson's
bill rose 15% from January. But the FT has kept its costs down through
not adding extra pages and limiting pull-out sections. Its advertising
rates have risen by 15%.
Pearson's dull area was educational publishing, where profits dipped
8% to #51m. Addison Wesley in the US was hit by a slowdown in sales as
schools prepared for changes in 1995 while Longman in the UK was
affected by spending cuts. Integration of the two companies is now
proceeding and long-term prospects are thought to be good given
worldwide demand for English tuition. Mr Barlow said the companies'
intellectual property rights meant that it should be able to prosper
whatever the delivery system.
Lazard Brothers, Pearson's investment banking arm, barely gets a
mention in the results statement and group chairman Lord Blakenham
accepts that it is not a core activity. But it makes reasonable profits,
though down last year, and is useful for finding acquisitions. So it
will remain in the group.
Pearson shares slipped 20p to 564p on some disappointment with the
underlying picture but the shares, selling at 16 times earnings and 3.3%
are a strong hold given Pearson's spread across the broad media sector.
The dividend goes up 15% to 15p after a final of 9.25p.

THE future of employee remuneration will be brought home to Scottish
clients of actuarial and benefits consultant R Watson &amp; Sons, which
yesterday forged a global alliance with The Wyatt Company of the US.
Watson's clients who require advice on packages for overseas
employees, such as United Distillers' owner, Guinness, and Bank of
Scotland, will be provided with a better handle on the US and Far East
through Wyatt.
Meanwhile, Watson will lead Wyatt in Europe, Africa and the British
Caribbean, although the two firms will operate as a joint venture in
Continental Europe.
In Scotland, the six staff at Wyatt's Glasgow and Edinburgh offices
are moving over to Watson's Edinburgh offices, with a total of 27
Scottish employees working under the name of Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
Although Watson and Wyatt will retain their respective independence as
partnership and corporation, the actuarial and benefits consultants will
make a ''modest but significant'' financial investment in each other.
The combined operation will have annual revenues of more than #500m
and employ more than 4000 professionals in 80 offices.
In the UK, it will act as consultant to some of the largest pension
funds, including those of Guinness, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale
Bank, and petroleum giant Elf Enterprise.
Wyatt's employee remuneration surveys are considered by some to be the
''bible'' of the human resources profession.
Surrey-based Watson, which grew up as a consulting actuary and pension
consultant but has expanded its services to encompass the total
remuneration package over the last decade, will be able to plug into the
Washington-based company's considerable database.

FORTH Ports chief executive Hugh Thompson was desperately looking for
some wood to touch when asked what were the problems of Britain's second
largest port operator.
This year has started off well with tonnages ahead by 15% so far
auguring well for pre-tax profits to increase from 1994's #13.7m to
perhaps #15.8m. is after a rise last year of 43% including #1.6m from
the Victoria Quay development in Leith which now houses the Scottish
Office and with there being perhaps another #1.1m still to come.
The questions now are that of geographic expansion. Nearer home is the
possibility that the joint application in association with Babcock
International, the Bank of Scotland and Scottish Power to takeover the
Royal Rosyth Dockyard could be successful.
Dundee could become available in May as it moves into the private
sector either through a tender sale or a management buyout. That would
add a company with a #5m turnover and around #400,000 profit to the
portfolio. More significant is the application to jointly develop
Birkenhead as a port in jointly with two property companies.
The attraction is that Irish Sea trade is growing at 15% annually and
the #20m or so development would cater for Ro-Ro traffic -- a grant
would cover just under half the cost once an enabling act has passed
through Parliament.
Although Forth has been in talks to acquire other port companies,
asking prices are still probably too high and joint ventures seem to be
the cheaper option.
Group tonnages were at record levels, soaring two thirds to 44.4
million tonnes. Piped cargo benefited from a full year at Hound Point,
unloading North Sea oil for BP. That is very low-margin, high-volume
revenue and less, probably, than the Braefoot complex serving Mossmorran
where Shell is seeking to extend and build a third jetty. Overall piped
cargo dues amount to 24p per tonne.
Dry cargo was buoyant with record levels of imported Greek cement and
Blue Circle, Dunbar exports to Norway. Forest products, including
newsprint, were strong as was animal feed. Grangemouth was slightly down
due to internal problems at BP, while Leith saw little change for
British Pipe Coaters as it waits the hoped-for Britannia Field
development, probably in 1997.
In the medium term, there is further property potential in Edinburgh.
That includes both a new waterfront development as well as the
possibility that in the event of greater devolution, it may be possible
to concentrate all administration around Victoria Quay rather than
maintaining perhaps eight separate sites in Edinburgh.
The dividend total has leapt 37% to 9.95p with a 7.25p final for a
2.8% yield -- a good, high quality and cash rich investment.

SCOTTISH Environment Minister Sir Hector Monro spoke yesterday of
growing public concern over the problem of noisy neighbours.
His comments came as the Government issued proposals, including a new
law on the problem of late-night neighbourhood noise.
Sir Hector said noisy neighbours caused ''distress and suffering'' to
people they lived next to.
Nine recommendations are to go out for consultation to local
authorities, the police and the public. They have been drawn up by the
Scottish Office, the Welsh Office and the Department of Environment.
A Scottish Office spokesman said that, because police in Scotland had
more power than their counterparts in England and Wales to deal with the
noisy neighbour problem, the number of cases north of the Border was
much lower.
Figures show that noise complaints in England and Wales for 1992-93
totalled 111,515, compared with only 1939 in Scotland.
Despite the statistical differences, a Scottish Office spokesman said
it was felt that the Scottish public should be given the chance to see
if it believed enough was being done to deal with noisy neighbours.
Among the proposals put forward include a new criminal offence to
apply to nighttime neighbourhood noise disturbances and more powers for
local authorities to deal with the problem. After consultation,
consideration would have to be given to whether any of the
recommendations should be applied in Scotland.
Sir Hector said :''Although existing legislation can provide
appropriate remedies across a range of situations, it is clear that more
needs to be done in this area.
''I will be most interested to study the comments made in response to
the paper.''

PERSONAL equity plans (Peps) showed the only increase in sales in
February during an otherwise quiet month for the unit trust industry, it
was announced yesterday.
While total net sales of unit trusts slipped to #241m from #310m in
January, net Pep sales increased to #167m from #144m, said the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds.
Director-general Philip Warland said there were two distinct trends in
the industry at present. ''People with low levels of equity holdings are
continuing to buy Peps, which must be the right decision,'' he said.
''Where substantial portfolios are being managed, the last few months
have seen a waiting game with cash being a rewarding short-term home for
funds. If the market bounces, which it may be doing now, money will flow
back quite quickly.''

DEVOLUTION or independence is unlikely to harm the investment plans of
US firms in Scotland.
This was the inference yesterday of Mrs Bobette Orr, the US Consul
General in Scotland, who became the first woman for more than 20 years
to address the monthly members' meeting of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
Using all her diplomatic skills gained over the years in US trade and
industry postings, she avoided directly answering how devolution or
independence would affect US investment in Scotland.
But she emphasised that Scotland's market accessibility --
particularly to Europe, the quality of the workforce, and the
infrastructure, were the principal reasons for the continual
strengthening of US investment.
She said the US foreign and commercial service was developing a
programme called Showcase Europe, which aimed to assist companies to
expand their business operations throughout Europe.
The increased confidence in Scotland, she said, had been borne out by
the recent #9m investment at Dalgety Bay, Fife, by US electronics
communications giant AT&amp;T, which formerly traded under the NCR brand
name in cash dispensers.
She said AT&amp;T president Dr James Adamson had told her last week that
the new facility ''could have gone anywhere in the world, including the
US.'' The success of AT&amp;T's factory in Dundee is understood to be the
principle reason for siting the new operation in Scotland.
The US Consul General also spoke of the importance of continued trade
liberalisation, echoing the world view of GATT and the new World Trade
Organisation, in the face of criticisms that trading sanctions imposed
by the US had led to it being branded as ''fortress America.''
She pointed out that Scottish exports to the US had increased by 20%
in the past year.
Scottish Enterprise figures show exports to the US were worth #1430m
in 1993. This compares with #1174m in 1992 and #1003m in 1991. The
figures show inward investment by US companies to Scotland was #366.2m
in 1993 compared to #186.1m in 1992.
The grandmother and economist, who took up her post in Edinburgh in
July, 1992, also spoke of the cultural and business history between the
two countries.
Mrs Orr, from Chicago, said she was ''very proud'' to have been
invited to address Glasgow Chamber of Commerce although she stressed
that the mantle of being the first woman to do so for more than 20 years
held no substance.
''I am the first woman to be a Consul General in Scotland. To me that
is not the critical issue. The important thing is I am proud to be here
doing the job,'' she said.

<TEXT>
FINE china-maker Royal Doulton is to build its first overseas factory
to target growing markets in the USA and Asia, it was announced
yesterday.
The Stoke-on-Trent-based firm will employ up to 600 on a site outside
Jakarta, in conjunction with an Indonesian company, to produce mid-price
fine china products.
The move indicates ''significant growth opportunities'' for Royal
Doulton, which hopes to be manufacturing from the new factory by the end
of next year.
Up to 30 managers, supervisors and key workers from the UK would work
on secondment in Jakarta, according to chief executive Stuart Lyons. The
cost of the project will be around #20m.
Royal Doulton yesterday reported results for 1994, its first full year
as an independently-listed stock market company after its demerger from
Pearson.
Pre-tax profits jumped to #12.6m from #3m in 1993, which was affected
by demerger costs and management charges paid to Pearson.
Shareholders will receive a dividend total of 7.5p from earnings per
share of 18.4p.

MOTORS, marketing and international services group Inchcape had
already taken a pasting earlier this year and yesterday the shares
plunged anew, dropping 19p to a 1994-95 closing ''low'' of 281p on a
fresh profits warning.
While this was off the worst level of 272p on the day, the extent of
the damage that the company has suffered is reflected in the fact that
its ''high'' for 1994-95 was 609p.
Inchcape's troubles continue to centre on its motors operations where
the strength of the yen allied with very difficult European markets for
Japanese car distribution -- Toyota, Mazda and Daihatsu -- and also in
Hong Kong after new tax measures and declining consumer confidence,
hammered profits.
Ahead of exceptional items, profits overall last year fell 8.6% from
#252.4m to #230.6m. This is more or less in line with the January
warning from the company that full-year profits would be about 10%
lower.
Chairman Sir David Plastow has now cautioned that first-half profits
for 1995 will be significantly below those of the first half of 1994
and, indeed, the company currently believes that they will be below the
second half of 1994.
Last year discontinuance of the Inchcape's TMSC joint venture
exporting Toyota vehicles to China accounted for #13.9m of the profit
shortfall, while currency movements accounted for another #4.7m on
translation into sterling. Stripping these out would leave the
underlying business just 1% short of the 1993 figure.
Inchcape has, of course, benefited from strong recovery in its
marketing companies and continued growth from its services division
though this was not enough to completely offset motors where profits
slumped 18% to #143m. Under chief executive Charles Mackay, action is
being taken to try to counter the present adverse conditions with the
aim of growing sales, improving margins, cutting overheads and reducing
assets.
Clearly there is a limit to what can be done. Promotional spending for
example itself can cut into margins if not accompanies by sufficient
volume growth. Inchcape says it has redoubled its efforts in recent
months, but it will not be clear until the second half whether the
company has by then turned the corner.
Aside from the problem of the strength of the yen, which increases the
costs of Japanese manufactured vehicles, these cars sell anyway to
mainly private buyers and not to fleets. And it is the private purchase
motor sector which has taken a tumble, particularly in the UK.
The downturn in car sales in Hong Kong, where Inchcape has more than
40% of the market, is a severe blow and recovery there must depend a
great deal on consumer confidence, hit by a fall in share prices and
property values.
The plusses are marketing where profits were 30% higher than in 1993
and also 21% ahead of the previous record results in 1992, and in
services which saw rapid integration of Bain Hogg in insurance services
both at home and overseas.
There was a seven-month contribution from Hogg Group to boost
insurance services' profits despite heavy investment in systems and
weakening in international markets. But while the latter led to lower
profits in the second half from the original Bain Clarkson business,
significant cost savings of around #7m are expected this year as a
result of the merger.
A maintained final dividend of 9p takes the total to 15p, an increase
of 1.4% from the previous year's 14.8p.

Milan, Monday
MAURIZIO Gucci, a former chairman of the Gucci luxury goods empire,
was shot dead outside his office in Milan today.
Police said a well-dressed man fired two shots from behind into
45-year-old Gucci's shoulder and buttocks. When Gucci turned round the
gunman fired two more shots into his face at close range.
A guard at the building on Milan's central via Palestro, was hit in
the shoulder but not seriously hurt.
The killer, a man in his 30s or 40s, fled in a green Renault car
driven by an accomplice, police said.
Detectives originally thought the killing was the work of a
professional hitman, but now believe it was carried out by an amateur
because the first two shots were not fatal.
There was still no clear motive for the attack and police said staff
at Gucci's firm knew of no threats or extortion attempts against their
millionaire boss.
Maurizio Gucci was the last grandson of the firm's founder, Guccio
Gucci, to be still involved with the company until he sold his 50% stake
in 1993 to the London-based Arab investment bank Investcorp for a sum
reported to be between #100 million and #133 million after an
acrimonious boardroom battle. At the same time he gave up the
chairmanship.
Maurizio's cousins Roberto, Paolo and Giorgio sold their half to
Investcorp in 1987 after an internal feud.
The company said it was shocked by today's killing and a spokeswoman
added: ''The death of Maurizio is a blow but I would like to stress that
relations between Maurizio and the Gucci company ended in 1993.''
Maurizio Gucci, who lived in the Swiss mountain resort of St Moritz,
had recently set up his own company, Vierse, at the Milan office where
he was killed.
His companion Paola and one of two daughters rushed to the scene in
tears after learning of his death on the radio, witnesses said.
The Gucci empire, whose red and green motif and linked GG logo
appeared on thousands of franchised products, grew into a jetsetters'
favourite from its humble origins in 1906 at a saddlery shop in
Florence.--Reuter

St John's, Monday
THE European Union has suspended North Atlantic fishing talks until
Canada's ''harassment'' stops. It accused Canada of international piracy
today as Canadian and Spanish vessels appeared poised for another
showdown on the high seas off the coast of Newfoundland.
EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino said the member states ended
their meeting in Brussels, creating a stand-off. Its object had been to
consider possible action, including economic sanctions, against Ottawa
after Canadian vessels cut the nets of a Spanish trawler on Sunday and
attempted to board two ships fishing for turbot in disputed waters
outside its 200 nautical mile limit.
''The Canadian Government is using force illegally. It's a real act of
international piracy,'' Bonino said in an interview with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
''Violence and force are forbidden. I do believe you are going too
far,'' said the commissioner, who is in New York for the opening of a
United Nations conference to discuss management of fish species that
straddle international and territorial boundaries.
''The Union will not play the scapegoat for the mismanagement of
fisheries by the Canadian authorities,'' Bonino said. She claimed Canada
cut the nets of the vessel, the Pescarmaro 1, well outside the disputed
area.
Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin remained defiant, however,
saying Canada would continue to take any action necessary to enforce a
unilateral moratorium on fishing for turbot, also known as Greenland
halibut, on the Grand Banks.
Tobin told the CBC that 14 Spanish ships had converged in an area of
the foggy north Atlantic around the Spanish patrol vessel the Vigia, but
did not appear to be fishing.
''We have some six Canadian vessels that are on standby and monitoring
the situation. It is our intention to use whatever operational options
are deemed appropriate by the people on the water depending on how the
day develops.''
Earlier, one of the captains of the Spanish trawlers told Spanish
state radio they were headed back to the disputed area and were
determined to fish.
''We will see what happens in the morning, but we are ready for
anything,'' said Jose Rodriguez, captain of the fishing boat Freidemar
1. ''There is no way we are going to give up fishing in these waters. It
is our right and we are not giving up, come what may.''
Canada has accused European fleets, mainly Spanish, of overfishing for
turbot and is pushing for tougher conservation measures after the
closure of the cod fishery in 1992 threw tens of thousands of Atlantic
coast fisherman out of work.
Europe says Canada has no right to police the high seas outside its
jurisdiction and has demanded a greater share of the international
27,000-tonne turbot quota.
The Estai, whose captain was charged with illegal fishing and
obstructing justice, was freed when its owners posted a Canadian
$500,000 bond. It arrived home in the Galician port of Vigo last week to
a hero's welcome.
Murray Ritchie, European Editor, writes: The row between Canada and
the EU is increasingly become a battle for credibility.
Canada justified its arrest and detention of the Estai earlier this
month by saying she had hidden part of her catch in a secret hold, she
had two log books, one of which carried false details of the haul, and
that more than 80% of her catch was undersized.
The commission later produced figures disputing all of these points,
claiming that the evidence was supporting the innocence of the Spanish
was clear and that it had been produced by British inspectors working on
behalf of the EU.
It said about 25% of the catch was undersized which was normal for a
trawler in such circumstances. The twin log books were explained by the
fact that the Estai's captain had completed one, and had begun a second
to continue monitoring his catch.
A commission spokesman said yesterday that the question of mesh size
in the Estai's nets -- abandoned when the Canadians challenged the
trawler -- remained open. Canada has claimed the mesh was too small.
The spokesman said: ''We remain open as to the question of proof on
this matter.'' The commission has said that it does not necessarily
accept that the nets recovered by Canada from the seabed are those
jettisoned by the Estai.
''The declaration of the Canadians that they appear to be the Estai's
nets is not proof,'' he added.
Mr Luis Atienza, Spanish fisheries minister, was by coincidence in
Brussels for a Council of Ministers meeting. But he appeared anxious not
to inflame the crisis. ''We expect strong sanctions against Canada,'' he
said, repeating the Spanish line when the Estai was first seized. ''It
is difficult to negotiate with Canada while under this sort of
pressure,'' he complained when asked about the weekend cutting of
Spanish nets.

Sarajevo, Monday
UN peacekeepers today threatened Bosnian Serbs with Nato air strikes
if they persisted in attacking civilians. Pressure from the West also
mounted on the Bosnian Government to halt military action.
The threat of UN bombing of the Serbs followed their shelling of four
''safe havens'' last week in retaliation for offensives in northern and
central Bosnia by the Muslim-led Government army.
''Attacks which come from outside a safe area and which deliberately
target civilians will meet a resolute response from us including the use
of air power,'' UN spokesman Colum Murphy told Reuters.
Fighting has raged for more than a week for control of two key
communications facilities in northern and central Bosnia, shattering a
four-month truce that was not due to expire until the end of next month.
UN officials say the Bosnian army has gained ground against the Serbs in
the campaign.
The Serbs, who hold 70% of the territory, have rejected peace
proposals dividing Bosnia into two almost equal parts.
Murphy, spokesman for the new UN commander in Bosnia, British General
Rupert Smith, said his commander's warning of Nato air strikes must be
taken seriously.
He said Smith was ready to take ''very forceful action -- there are no
hollow threats here.''
Smith's predecessor, General Sir Michael Rose, used Nato warplanes
rarely because the Serbs retaliated by taking peacekeepers hostage and
blockading UN aid to the Moslems.
Murphy spoke after the UN decided against calling Nato in at the
weekend when Serb gunners pounded the east Bosnian enclave of Gorazde,
seriously wounding seven civilians.
Murphy said the UN could not find the attacking artillery batteries
and had decided on restraint for political reasons while seeking talks
with the Bosnian Serb army commander, General Ratko Mladic.
''It is not something to be used frivolously. We may well err in some
of these decisions,'' he added. ''If we do, we will err on the side of
caution, but we will not be pushed to the point where such events will
go without answer on our part.''
Near Tuzla, in the north-east, 25 Swedish peacekeepers have been
trapped by the fighting between Bosnian and Serb forces, and are,
effectively, hostages.--Reuter

Zakho, Iraq, Monday
TURKEY today tried to pull a veil over its huge anti-guerrilla
operation in Iraq, which troops on the ground said was yielding sparse
results against elusive Kurdish rebels.
Foreign journalists were blocked from entering the Iraqi border from
Turkey in an apparent bid to curtail reports of civilian casualties in
the week-long drive, the largest military campaign of Turkey's modern
history.
Military authorities in Diyarbakir, nerve centre of the operation,
cancelled a news briefing today without explanation for a second day in
a row.
Turkey launched the operation, sending 35,000 soldiers into northern
Iraq, to try to smash bases of the rebels -- guerrillas of the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK) -- fighting for a homeland in south-east Turkey. Its
Western allies have expressed fears of civilian casualties.
Iraqi Kurds and Western aid workers say two civilians were killed and
nine wounded in the push. Turkey denies harming any civilians.
Turkish troops preparing to move on a rebel camp at Haftanin, about 18
miles east of the Iraqi border town of Zakho, said most inhabitants
probably fled deep into the mountains on the Iraqi-Turkish border weeks
ago.
''They will probably come back when we leave but our goal is to clean
this area for now,'' an officer told Reuters.
Iraqi Kurds said the rebels had melted away into the mountains around
Haftanin two weeks ago, either abandoning the camp or leaving a token
force.
They were warned of a Turkish offensive by a highly visible military
build-up on the border beforehand, the Iraqis said.
''Many PKK fled towards the border which is impossible for us to
control completely,'' a Turkish officer said. ''Look at them, they are
huge,'' he added, pointing to the rugged peaks of about 10,000ft which
straddle the border.

INSIDE fashion's profligate domain little thrills believers quite so
much as the whisper of scandal that torments a Big Name. But today in
Milan there is no need to plant perfumed mischief in the ear of the
faithful. Today horror and rumour are there already, the routine
aftershocks of murder. Strange how it is only in death that something
about this victim has ever been called ''routine''.
Yesterday, at around 8.30am, Maurizio Gucci was gunned down in the
centre of the city by an assassin whose weapon was equipped with a
silencer. Nothing was stolen from his person; nothing had been disturbed
in the office of his new company, VIERSE, nearby. A swift pavement
execution: two bullets in the back, two in the face; a doorman wounded
in the shoulder; a getaway in a Renault, the engine left running and
then driven by another. One man's extraordinary, warring life of luxury
had ended in seconds on the via Palestro.
Despite its long, inscrutable history of contract killings, Italy is
perplexed about how to respond to this slaying. Within his family and
without, Maurizio Gucci, aged 45, certainly had enemies, but his
association with the fashion house that bears his name ended in 1993
when he sold his 50% share, leaving Investcorp, an Arab investment bank
in London, with full control.
Six years previously that company had purchased the other half share
of Maurizio's three cousins after an ugly internal wrangle among the
clan. The cousins' riddance was seen as Maurizio's triumph but hardly
had the new formalities been exchanged than more rancour erupted,
eventually causing Maurizio's departure as chairman with a cheque for
around #100m.
But long before harmony had never been a natural inclination in that
permanently suspicious house, and no doubt there are those even now
relishing every moment of the family's past unseemly trouble; its fall
from grace for tax evasion; the charges of forgery and unscrupulous
infighting; the endless squabbles for copyright possession; the vicious
jealousies setting father against son, brother against brother, cousin
against cousin, uncle against nephew.
Maybe it is significant that in this dynasty no woman was able to hold
sway, only proud rivalrous men whose despotic discipline seemed to
spring from some dark venom. Paulo Gucci's English wife, Jenny, risked
the primitive wrath of her in-laws to tell Gerald McKnight, author of
Gucci, A House Divided, that being married into the family was like
''sitting down to dinner with the Borgias''.
In creating the most expensive bag-and-baggage for first-class living,
the family peddled myths. Guccio Gucci , the empire's founder, was a
dishwasher at London's Savoy before returning to Italy to set up his
leather business. But as that enterprise flourished so his humble past
became overladen with grandiose claims that the Guccis were descended
from the Medicis and had been aristocratic saddlemakers to European
monarchies.
Yet for all their Florentine elan, the Guccis mistook arrogance for
style and avarice for proper business practice. In his eighties Aldo
Gucci, the autocratic patriarch who expanded the business throughout the
world in the sixties, spent one year in an American prison for tax
fraud, the evidence against him having been given to the US authorities
by Paulo, his son. Maurizio was Aldo's nephew, and in 1988 he too was
convicted of tax fraud in Italy after his uncle claimed he was trying to
evade inheritance taxes by forging his father's signature. The one-year
suspended sentence was later quashed by an appeal court.
Meanwhile Paulo fell into more legal dispute with the parent company
concerning the right to market his own breakaway Gucci designs. But if
such warfare diminished some of the profits no-one in the family was
exactly reduced to patching holes in their hand-finished wallets.
However, if all this shabby conflict provided competitors with the
golden moment to exploit their own exquisite accessories, it did cause
spasms of shame elsewhere.
Italy is a country where the first source of power is the family.
Within its walls, amid its company, the individual finds help and
consolation, advice, provisions, loans and allies to sustain all manner
of activity. This mosaic of emotions and vested support is prevalent
right through the Italian fashion industry from Benetton to Versace. And
in return the family expects the first loyalty of everyone within its
fold.
When it self-destructs through egomania, greed, and betrayal by its
own, then it offends every Italian's sense of honour and the belief that
the family preserves an ancient ark of wisdom and ideals.
For a while luxury's superior design endowed the Gucci name with
sacramental status but the brutality of Maurizio's death seems like a
curse on all of that. What people may remember now is a family driven to
the precipice of Mammon.

THE trouble with the future is that, while it is by definition not
ours to know, the pressures to get some kind of handle on what it might
hold consistently prove well-nigh irresistible.
That delicious tension brings together the Lottery and race card
punter, the entire global investment community and assorted planners and
pollsters. It increasingly dominates sporting discussion and political
debate. Arguably more effort is now devoted to analysing what might just
possibly lie ahead than to turning over our collective experience of the
here and now, the better to understand it.
Who'll win this weekend's top-of-the-table clash or the next General
Election? Where will the FTSE-100 index stand this time next month or
the process of European integration this time next year? Will Mr Major
still be Prime Minister when the party conference season rolls round
again? Will the sun shine at all on Ian McAskill this Thursday?
Maybe it's a sign of age, but I'm growing a little restless over all
this speculative preoccupation with tomorrow. Especially when today's
nothing special to write home about and contains so much unfinished
business. I'm beginning to wonder if our penchant for dwelling on the
future is directly related to our inability to do much to improve the
world we inhabit right now.
But even a crusty cynic like me can still be seduced into the
occasional spot of amateur futurology. I spent a couple of hours last
week at the Ayrshire seaside, assisting a closeted group of secondary
headteachers from all over Scotland, wrestling with the question of what
schools will look like in the year 2020.
I conceded to them, at the outset, that I'm not a great believer in
crystal balls. I even gave the more conservative elements in the group
the comfort of recalling that -- had the same exercise been carried out
25 years ago, in 1970 -- we now know that, while lots of unpredictable
things have happened since, schools, in terms of their physical fabric
and internal organisation, are not so very different now from then, when
I happened to be a teacher myself.
Next I managed to upset some of those present. I wondered, out loud,
why today's schools are not closer to the hub of the so-called
information revolution. I even speculated -- I know, he says it makes
him restless then he proceeds to indulge himself -- about whether
schools as we know them will exist at all 25 years from now, given the
proliferating alternative channels for acquiring information and skills
already available to us.
They weren't meant to be idle thoughts. We are, according to some of
the key strategic writers in this area, now well into the latter stages
of the information age. What started with the invention of the
transistor in 1948, and now rests on chips like Intel's Pentium
containing millions of transistors on a single tiny fragment of etched
silicon, may still have plenty of surprises in store, as the pace of
technological change accelerates.
But by around 2020, say writers like Stan Davis and Bill Davidson*,
the information economy will have reached maturity, as the agricultural
and industrial economies did before it. If the school system is to
retain a role in that maturity -- if formal education is to continue, in
part, to be about the transmission of knowledge and understanding from
one generation to the next -- there's not that much time left for
educators to recapture some of the high ground in this particular
revolution. Otherwise what they have to offer may appear, by 2020,
somewhat irrelevant.
Just in case I risked a lynching by 28 heedies, I deployed some
stories about how other industries have been trying to come to terms
with the information age. I retold Davis and Davidson's example of the
smart, paperless toilet, developed in Japan, which not only sprays you
with warm water after you've done the business, it also blows warm
drying air and will, if you wish, dispense a dash of scent too.
It keeps the seat warm in winter and automatically sanitizes the bowl
after use. Higher spec models will analyse a sample of your urine and
measure your body temperature, weight, blood pressure and pulse into the
bargain. It will either store 130 days worth of such data or transmit
it, for further analysis, to an appropriate medical centre. Five million
of those smart toilets had already been sold by the time Davis and
Davidson's book was first published in 1991.
Four years further on, Scotland's contribution to the challenge of
''informationalising'' the humble toilet has been the unhappy saga of
Barrhead Sanitaryware, an all-too-familiar story of the closure of
ageing excess capacity by a national manufacturer, a laudable attempt by
workers to create a phoenix, followed by a cash crisis, a flurry of
threatened writs and a crisis takeover. Far from being able to modernise
the product range, the Barrhead workforce didn't even have the resources
to introduce colour to their ceramic bowls!
Smart toilets, smart cards, smart cars . . . the race is progressively
going to those who can revitalise mature manufactured goods with an
additional capacity to generate, process, store, and transmit data. Are
we still in that race? Or are we so busy dreaming of recapturing the
mature indigenous industries we have largely lost -- cars, machine
tools, motor cycles, ships, and so on -- that we've failed to notice
that this further race is well under way?
As I said to that group of headteachers, it's easy to look back with
nostalgia. It's easy to look forward in fear. The real challenge to look
forward with optimism and make the most of the new opportunities which
lie ahead. The opportunities are many. But time is short.

PITY the satirist in these times of ours. There he sits in front of
his screen, his bile at the ready, his senses on alert for the
hypocrisies of the day. Not for him the amoralism of simple humour, or
the selfishness of love songs. No, his strategy is to pick on some
social ill and, using exaggeration and a kind of absurd logic, reveal
its inherent madness.
So the satirist considers the NHS and comes up with this crazy vision.
He types in a frenzy, giggling to himself. ''A Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet will soon replace the Red Cross cafeteria at the Western
Infirmary.'' Yes! he yells, salivating at the deliciously cynical
contradictions implicit in his fantasy.
First, he imagines a little group, a mother with her children, going
to visit Daddy who's just had a heart bypass. They carry fresh fruit,
they enter the hospital and pass through the shopping mall on the way to
the lifts.
''Mum, Mum, I'm starving.''
''Well, wait till we get to your Dad. He'll probably offer you all of
that fruit. But he's got to get used to it. A new regime the doctor
said.''
''What's a regime?''
''More veg. Fewer fries. Less ginger. Ginseng maybe. Muesli.''
''When he gets home? That's what Dad's goantae get when he gets
home?''
''You bet. They gave me this pamphlet about it: 'Food for thought'.
I'm goantae buy a steamer, and bin the chip pan. Nurse said if I used my
imagination it didn't have to be expensive and she gave me this recipe
for black-eyed bean casserole . . . What's wrong with you?''
''It's my Dad . . . My Dad, we'll never get him out of here.''
''Och, son . . . he's goantae be fine . . .''
''He'll never leave here, Mum, I know he won't.''
''Course, he will.''
''I know my Daddy will never leave this hospital!''
And the child points to the counter where chicken nuggets and stiff
bar-b-qued wings were congealing in their buckets and pale reconstituted
chips spilled from their paper pokes. The mother stares and recognises
the truth of the child's outburst. Her man would never return home to
high fibre from this place.
The little group clasp each other as the dropped satsumas roll off
towards the exit. Above them the neon face of Colonel Virginia Saunders,
sporting a little goatee beard and a stetson, looks down on them. They
were safe. Big Bottomley was watching them.
The satirist is on a roll with this one. Next his feverish imagination
pictures the process by which this surreal decision was made. The NHS
meeting is underway. One unit in the hospital mall remains up for grabs
and the competition is fierce.
Scottish Brewers are so far the strongest contenders weighing in with
a very convincing case for a theme pub. Pissed punters already on the
premises would relieve the ambulance services. Nurses could up their
income by working as barmaids dispensing measures, helping customers
calculate their weekly alcohol units, all without having to change their
uniforms or their bedside manners.
Junior doctors enjoying their first night off after 80 hours on call
would no longer be at risk crossing that busy road outside the hospital.
They could simply make for the mall without leaving the building,
straight into the welcoming atmosphere of the Broken Arms.
The committee nod with interest and absent-mindedly fiddle with the
complimentary miniatures in front of them.
But the spokeswoman for the massage parlour is arousing interest too.
She is wearing a lycra leotard with ''Fizzy-Oh!'' across her front. A
member of the committee is a little confused and thinks she is a kind of
ra-ra girl with the Scottish Brewers lot. It is explained that her
''Fizzy-Oh!'' is a pun on ''physio'', as in ''physiotherapist''.
The ''Fizzy-Oh!'' massage parlour, the lady in lycra goes on to
explain, would be a place both of relaxation and muscle regeneration and
sometimes a merging of the two. BUPA patients would qualify for
''extras'' but a wide range of services would be available for the
ordinary patients and indeed the man off the street.
The ''Fizzy-Oh!'' masseuses -- or girls as they were sometimes called
-- were also fully certificated in the handling of motorised aids, all
general walking-stick procedures, and the specific manipulation of those
parts of the body grown flaccid through lack of use.
The committee accept the vouchers which enable them to sample the
''Fizzy-Oh!'' All Day Special at the recently opened branch in the
Forge, Parkhead.
But Kentucky Fried Chicken goes on to win the day. No freebies, no
vouchers, no free fries. The committee love the idea of being
uncompromised -- they down the miniatures, hand back the vouchers, and,
after the cabaret, remember their function as responsible committee
members. They look at the figures and they do their sums. Nuggets it is.
The satirist sits back, stretches and rereads his lovely ludicrous
fantasy. He goes out for a walk to breathe some real air and buy a
newspaper. He finds that it's a McDonald's they were going to pop in the
mall -- and it was the Southern General not the Western. But the board
has now dropped its plans for ''a number of factors''.
So nothing like the satirist's vision has materialised, has it?
Nothing near.

HONEST, we do not want to interfere in the due democratic process of
the folk of Dunoon electing members to their new unitary local
authority. But we are still puzzled by the age-old question in rural
Scottish politics: when is an independent really a Tory in disguise?
We mentioned in our review of the hustings for the Cowal seats of
Argyll and Bute that there was an amazing number of independent
candidates, including Scott McClure, the sitting councillor who was, and
perhaps still is, in line to be the next Tory candidate for the
parliamentary seat.
Mr McClure is now on record in his local paper, the Dunoon Standard,
as saying he is an independent and not a member of any party.
This has got the phone lines going to the Diary from Cowal Tories who
remember Mr McClure being co-opted on to the executive committee of the
local Conservative and Unionist Association as representing the Young
Tories. A tad late at the age of 33, but never mind.
The thing is they cannot recall him ever resigning this post nor
quitting the party.
We managed to contact the Cowal Tory chairperson, Hazel Hall, to ask
if she can recall the circumstances of Mr McClure's departure from the
party. Ms Hall, who runs the Ardentinny Hotel, was too busy to speak to
us and didn't have the details to hand.
Look, we know Cowal Tories have such a large membership, and things
can get hectic in Ardentinny in March. We'll get the answer eventually
-- is he Tory or is he independent, or both?
On another
plane
THE Scotland team had to fly out to Russia yesterday before Davie
Cooper's funeral. As a mark of respect, there was a moment of
commemoration on the airplane. A journalist, trying to confirm with an
SFA person that there would be a service on the plane, was told: ''Yes,
there will be coffee and soft drinks as usual.''
A likely tail
IT is good to see women getting involved in the art of brewing. The
London Drinker Festival marked International Women's Day earlier this
month (yes, for shelf life of this story see bottom of the can) by
inviting some lady brewers to exhibit their products.
Liz Mitchell from the Tipsy Toad Brewery duly brought along samples of
her latest beer which rejoices in the name of Black Tadger. We asked,
quite nervously, the provenance of this name.
It has to with the toad part of her brewery name. In Jersey they still
speak their own dialect of French. A tadpole is a tadge. The beer is a
dark colour. Thus, naturally, we have the name Black Tadger.
She also tells us that in Jersey French the word toad translates as un
crappo. But we won't go into all that.
THE CONVENER'S TALE, PART TWO
NEW readers begin here: Frances Duncan, convener of Tayside Regional
Council, goes on a trade mission to the People's Republic of China.
Instead of keeping relatively quiet about the freebie or insisting that
it was all very tiring but worthwhile, she has the council produce a
thin novella about her trip in the style of Adrian Mole.
The story so far: Mrs Duncan gets up early, reminds her husband Ron to
change his underpants regularly, browses round the duty free at Heathrow
Airport, doesn't watch the inflight movie but puts on the socks provided
by the airline, has a wash and brush-up in Hong Kong and then arrives in
Haikou to be escorted by police who throw things at cars that get in the
way of the convener's motorcade. Now read on.
We pick up the story on Tuesday January 17:
MY first duty of the day is to be officially welcomed by the
vice-governor of Hainan Province. The vice-governor and I exchanged
pleasantries and gifts, all of which was screened on TV later that
evening. I then visited a canning factory where coconut juice is canned.
First the owner and I chatted across a table. This was followed by a
tour of the factory where all the staff also live in.
We move on to the engagement after lunch when the delegation are
invited to view the city from a 34-storey building: When we reached the
top the view was breathtaking and although a slight breeze was blowing
it was quite warm, even at that height. In the evening the delegation
meet with the chairman of Hainan Provincial People's Congress where
again I am afforded the ''head of state'' position. We exchange
greetings and gifts followed by a banquet in our honour and once again
we were on the TV news.
On Wednesday, Convener Duncan manages to fit into her schedule a
walk to take in some fresh air: At this point I notice I am being
followed. I stop. He stops. I walk. He walks. Who is he? Why is he
dogging my every step. I hurry back to the hotel and order up a cup of
tea. He sits nearby. (Exciting, intit?)
I decide to report him. After all I am alone at this time in a strange
country as my colleagues are some miles away. Anything could happen to
me. The person I spoke to smiles and informed me that this man was my
personal bodyguard and should I require assistance at night there were
another two in the bedroom across from mine.
The next day, Thursday, the convener gives some valuable agriculture
advice to her Chinese hosts and experiences yet another example of the
high-handed attitudes of the local traffic police: The Hainan
Agriculture Science Academy are desperate for assistance from the West,
particularly Tayside, to help them preserve their tropical soft fruit
which is delicious.
They showed a great interest in improving their cattle stock. I
mentioned frozen embryos and artificial insemination but it would appear
they want live calves which I suggested to them was maybe not a good
idea.
A minibus carrying a man, woman, two children, and goods overtook our
entourage. With that we came to a halt. The policeman in the lead car
removed the driver and placed in the police car. We later learned that
the motorist would be charged with a string of offences and have his
vehicle impounded.
On another occasion, a car beautifully decorated for a wedding, was
also stopped by pur ''friendly'' policeman and stripped of its
decorations. What the reason for this was I did not know.
* The Convener's Trade Mission to China is published by Tayside
Regional Council at taxpayers' expense. The Diary's extracts appear
entirely without permission.
Next and last episode: The convener has dead blood removed from her
neck, joins a karaoke night, and goes fishing for pearls.

THE year is 2020. The country is Scotland, and it has achieved
self-government. Schools have been abolished. In their place stand
learning centres which are open all year round. Staff are on short-term
contracts and performance-related pay.
Learning centres have budgets of 50m ecus and sponsorship from many
companies. Their funding is based on the number of identified users they
can attract throughout the year. Pupils negotiate their curriculum with
their personal adviser. Teachers no longer exist. They have been
replaced by interpersonal mentors.
Pupils do their work experience in the Pacific Rim. They attend LUs
(learning units) although they can use the internet to study from home.
This can cause problems, however, for learning centres whose quotients
for monitoring attendance are low (in other words those with a truancy
problem).
But they have risen to the new technology challenge by employing
specialist info-net surfers. Class sizes are a problem, though.
Typically there are 45 learners in a class. And the system still seems
to be failing some learners.
Only in 2020 they don't fail. They default on their meta-cognitive
quotients. Typically they come from dysfunctioning families which are
epistemologically disadvantaged. This rubs off on their children, who
are pedagogically challenged.
But learning centres are committed to home-LU links, only in 2020 such
links are made by video conferencing. And the family info-net. This also
presents learning centres with a business opportunity. For the family
info-net can be the vehicle for transmitting, live, the school show to
the entire community (franchising can open a window on the galaxy).
Pupils might attend the centre for four days, spending the fifth doing
business practice at the local business park. They might be doing
applied maths, technology, finance, and parenting at home,
communications and an arts module specialising in architecture in the
centre, and French through Pepsi Paris.
There are still directors of education, but they are also responsible
for housing and leisure, and they are accountants. In overall control is
the Scottish Parliament Unit for Education -- Spue for short. In case
you'd been wondering about the levity quotient in our peer into the
future, the acronym should confirm that it is indeed high.
Nearly 30 secondary headteachers who attended a conference last week
on the school of the future were challenged on the final day to make a
presentation of their vision of schooling 25 years from now.
They were put into four groups to produce their predictions. Each
group chose to have a bit of fun, envisioning in what Vivien Casteel
rightly described as an ingenious and light-hearted way. She is head of
Strathclyde region's staff college, a division of the authority's
educational development service.
It puts about 4500 staff through management courses each year and
organised the three-day conference, which also involved the Quality in
Education centre at Strathclyde University. Vivien Casteel said the aim
was to get heads away from the pressures of ''creeping incrementalism'',
which took up so much of their time, and give them the opportunity to be
proactive.
The heads, who came from all over Scotland, heard speakers take a
radical look at the role of the school in 2020, and had the opportunity
to question them.
Professor Alan Alexander, the leading expert on local government,
spoke about the context of schooling; Alf Young, The Herald's economics
editor, talked about people and structures; Professor John MacBeath,
director of QIE, tackled leadership; David Eastwood, headteacher of
Northfield Academy in Aberdeen, looked at learning and teaching; and
Martin Garden and Laura Stevenson of Lothian region's property services
department addressed learning by design.

Market Research Executive
TODAY we start a series in which people talk about their work, their
qualifications, and what job satisfaction they feel is offered by their
calling. We start with a young woman making her mark in market research.
SINEAD ASSENTI is more accustomed to asking questions than answering
them but turns out to be good at both. At 23 she runs a market-research
company, and knows the value of straight answers to straight questions.
How did she qualify? First of all by taking a degree in Communications
Studies at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh. Then she joined a
high-profile market-research agency in Glasgow as a graduate trainee,
working as part of a team and taking on a variety of responsibilities,
thanks to her willingness to work long hours for no extra pay.
''I think that's part of the secret in this profession,'' she says.
''If you put in the time there are plentiful opportunities to learn. It
all stands you in good stead later on.''
For Sinead, that ''later on'' came when she became manager of
Forgewood Market Research, a community business based at Forgewood in
Motherwell. Being a community business means qualifying for various
grants and employing as many local people as possible in return.
All of this is part of the highly-successful Forgewood urban
regeneration initiative, and her company was set up thanks to Motherwell
District Council, Community Enterprise in Strathclyde, and the
Motherwell Enterprise Development Company Ltd.
Now FMR has four permanent employees including herself, as well as a
pool of 150 interviewers mainly from central Scotland. ''They are like
freelancers,'' says Sinead, ''and we draw on them according to the
specific tasks''.
She herself likes meeting people, especially in the community, and
getting their opinions. Which is perhaps another vital qualification for
a job she clearly enjoys.
Her clients tend to be local authorities, Local Enterprise Companies,
and management/economic companies.
There are, she says, two kinds of market research: qualitative, where
people's depths of opinion on sometimes emotive issues are explored
face-to-face, and quantitative, where street or telephone interviews are
carried out to provide reliable statistical information.
Sometimes a video is prepared for showing to members of the public:
this takes place in a hall or a hotel, and people are asked to fill in
specially-prepared questionnaires afterwards.
FMR carries out feasibility studies, market and demand assessments,
human resource studies, housing surveys, environmental research, and
surveys for the tourism, leisure, and retail sectors. It also
specialises in database compilation and updating.
Is it a worthwhile job? ''I think so,'' says Sinead. ''We provide a
very important service, and market research is a vital tool in marketing
strategy.
''We take the attitude that every survey is unique, and avoid the
temptation to approach each one in the same fashion. A great deal of
thought is put into the compilation of our questionnaires, and to where
and when to carry them out.
''I like to think we put a particular effort into getting it right,

A PUBLIC inquiry into plans for a #3m sports centre on the west side
of Edinburgh got under way yesterday.
It began as Labour politicians gathered on the proposed site as part
of their local authority election campaign.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he was backing the
proposal for the centre at Drumbrae Terrace.
In its election manifesto, the Edinburgh Labour Party has pledged to
proceed with the construction of the facility, subject to the approval
of the inquiry.
The inquiry, being held in a local hotel, was called after some local
residents opposed the development. A Scottish Office Reporter will
preside over the hearing which is expected to last five days.
Mrs Pamela McInally, Labour candidate for the East Craigs area of the
city, said: ''The vast majority of people living in the local area fully
support the plans for a sports centre. A recreational facility such as
this is long overdue here and will provide a great boost for local
communities.''
Mr Robertson said Labour in Edinburgh had a commendable record of
providing such recreational facilities.
''Labour has opened new leisure centres, refurbished swimming pools,
improved and replaced playgrounds, expanded library and museum
facilities, and developed the leisure access scheme,'' he said.
After his visit to the site Mr Robertson travelled to Portobello to
meet local pensioners.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on the character-building role played by
outdoor centres in educating the young, and the funding threat it now
faces due to the imminent changes in local government
MOST successful people can look back at some episode in their lives
that sparked them into action and opened their eyes to their own
potential. If they are lucky, that spark will have been ignited during
formative years, instilling the kind of attitudes and skills that set
them up for life.
Contrary to the increasingly insular and limited thinking of many of
today's educationalists, enterprise and leadership are not cultivated
exclusively in Eton or Harrow, closed to all but a few, but rather in
those now-rare extraordinary experiences that encourage and nurture the
aspirations of all.
In the sixties and the seventies, educational visionaries saw
opportunities for the academic, personal and social development of young
people in the natural landscapes that surround most of Scotland's towns
and cities, and outdoor education centres were set up. They would
provide a support role to the curriculum rather than an integral part of
it.
Ardentinny was only one of several centres created at that time.
Blairvaddoch and Fascally were created by Glasgow, while Lothian was
already well down the road to establishing similar initatives.
It is significant that when the decision was taken to set up
Ardentinny, in June 1973, Renfrew Education Department appointed a
manager from industry to run it. David Lilley, the original appointee,
is still there today -- 22 years later.
David was a 39-year-old engineer/manager in the steel industry at the
time of his appointment, and he soon discovered that running an
educational centre for young people was similar to running a business.
''If we are going to do successful business in the broad world, we
must have people with an attitude that does not restrict them,'' says
David.
''We have to have people who are outgoing -- entrepreneurs not bound
by an urban mentality. At Ardentinny, we set out to create a pioneering
attitude, to show young people what is possible.
''It has been proven that children respond to the discipline that can
be inculcated by giving them this kind of experience. It widens their
horizons, heightens their aspirations and increases their quality of
life.''
David's original career as an engineer started at a traditional steel
manufacturing company in Sheffield where, as a student apprentice, he
gained broad-based experience.
After two years in the RAF, he joined the service department of the
company, advising customers all over the world on how their plants
should be operated.
He came to Polmadie, Glasgow, in 1959 with this department which was
run independently as a company, and employed around 90 people. From
senior engineer, he moved on to management, eventually in charge of the
whole department.
When another company within the group suffered cash flow problems, it
affected the whole group, and the Glasgow plants closed in 1969.
''Typical of many businesses and industries that come to Scotland, the
company decided to retrench,'' remembers David. ''If we put as much
effort and money into encouraging our own industries here in Scotland as
we do to encourage inward investment, I suspect we would do a lot
better. It is significant that the companies that do survive like Weirs,
Howdens, Babcock are indigenous.''
David Lilley moved back to Sheffield with his wife and children, and
was distressed to find that the paternalistic management of the company
had been replaced by a new style of management that valued equipment
more than human resources.
A short time after, while he was in Scotland on business, he arranged
to meet some friends who told him that Renfrew Education Department was
looking for someone to set up an outdoor education centre at Ardentinny
on the Cowal Peninsula. Since he and his wife were anxious to return to
Scotland with their children, he decided to apply.
He found his industrial background advantageous. He had no hang-ups
about education, and always had clear ideas about what he wanted from
his employees.
''I told the interviewers that if I was going to run an outdoor
centre, I would want the young people in my team to be self confident,
with firm opinions, discipline, a sense of responsibility, leadership
and team spirit -- the same attributes I had wanted from my colleagues
in industry,'' says David.
He got the job and set about establishing the centre, and discovered
that management techniques he'd used in industry apply everywhere.
According to David, starting any business requires a defining of
objectives, looking at what will be produced, what service will be
given, what equipment is required to achieve those objectives, and what
kind of personnel is required to operate that equipment.
The appointed staff are teacher trained, with physical skills to
deliver field-work options to the curriculum -- options like biology,
history, sailing and mountaineering.
''When the young people come to the centre, they are responsible for
their own affairs -- being on time, organising their own kits,
remembering their own packed lunch. These decisions are all related to
future decisons they will make as adults,'' says David.
''The world out there is not forgiving either personally or
environmentally. If you make a wrong decision, you suffer. At
Ardentinny, the pupils learn that if they forget their sweater, they
will get cold. They don't forget twice.''
This is often the first time that some pupils have met people like the
instructors who have travelled the world and who can motivate them. At
the end of the week they have genuine achievements, and have learned
life values and skills, especially valuable for those with low
aspirations or expectations.
Strathclyde Regional Council has been very supportive, making this
opportunity available to all children whatever their background, but for
the first time in 22 years, Ardentinny is under real threat.
David Lilley explains: ''The biggest threat to our survival is the
change to single tier authorities. We think the only way we can survive
is for our present clientele, who are going to be split into four
administrative areas -- East Renfrew, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, and
Argyll, to consortia, and enable us to continue.
''We know exactly how much Ardentinny costs, how much capacity we give
schools in these areas, and it would be very easy to divide up the costs
proportionately.
''The future of Ardentinny, which has survived and been universally
acclaimed for 22 years, now lies with the politicians. I would like to
think that, before I retire, Ardentinny has a safe home. Without it, we
would lose a valuable element of our education.''

FORMER Cabinet Minister Paul Channon was one of two Conservative MPs
to announce yesterday that they will not be standing at the next General
Election. A former Trade Secretary and Transport Secretary, Mr Channon,
59, is MP for Southend West and had a majority of nearly 12,000 in the
1992 General Election. Sir Peter Hordern, 65, MP for Horsham since 1964,
and the longest-serving member of the 1922 Tory backbench committee
executive, is also to stand down. He has a majority of 25,000.

POLITICIANS turned out in force yesterday to attend the funeral of
Ulster's longest-serving MP Sir James Kilfedder.
The 66-year-old North Down MP died from a heart attack last Tuesday.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and his Labour shadow Mo
Mowlam joined hundreds of friends, relatives and constituents who packed
into St Comgall's parish church in the seaside town of Bangor, County
Down.
Traffic around the church was diverted as several hundred more people
gathered on the pavement to bid farewell to the Popular Unionist Party
MP.
Canon Desmond McCreery told mourners: ''From every quarter over this
last week, amidst the great sorrow we all feel at Jim's passing, there
has been a crescendo of praise for the life and work of a truly great
and fine man.''
Floral tributes included those from the Secretary of State, the
Northern Ireland Select Committee and the High Commissioner of Sri
Lanka.
The Queen was represented by the Lord Lieutenant of County Down,
Colonel William Brownlow.
Ten of Northern Ireland's other 16 MPs attended the service.
After the church service, Sir James was buried at Roselawn Cemetery on
the outskirts of East Belfast.
The MP had represented North Down from 1970. Between 1964 and 1966, he
was MP for West Belfast.

DOCTOR Rudolf Steiner was an Austrian scientist, philosopher, artist
and educator, who opened a school for workers' children in the Waldorf
cigarette factory in Stuttgart in 1919. Nearly 80 years later, there are
more than 600 Steiner schools worldwide, and more than 1000
kindergartens, all following the same basic principles.
Steiner education, it is said, is based on love, with teachers
encouraging the pupils to view the subject they are studying with a
feeling of love. This focuses the attention on a genuine interest in a
particular subject, rather than simply using it to gain good grades.
All Steiner centres of education base their ethos on Rudolf Steiner's
own view of how children should be educated, clearly stated in his own
words: ''We shouldn't ask: what does a person need to know or be able to
do in order to fit into the existing social order? Instead we should
ask: what lives in each human being and what can be developed in him or
her? The new generation should not be made to be what present society
wants it to become.''
Throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland there are 34
Steiner schools and kindergartens, a very small number compared to
mainstream education. This may explain the criticisms levelled at some
of their methods, and the suspicious way in which something different
from the norm can be viewed.
The premise of protecting the right to childhood and the reliance of
children on adults to provide an environment conducive to positive
development is one that any teacher would uphold. It is applied
throughout Steiner education, with the emphasis on allowing children to
learn without pressure.
A simple, unhurried life begins with the kindergarten, which is
emphatically not a scaled-down copy of the real world. There are no
books, aids to early learning or finished toys, but shells, pine cones,
pieces of wood and coloured cloth, which a child uses for a purpose he
or she chooses. Initiatives and imagination are the key words, with no
recognition or discussion of achievements, success or failure.
Lower school covers the ages six to 14, with the child being taught by
the same class teacher for the entire period. The aim of this unique
relationship is to develop mutual trust and respect, producing a climate
of attention and openness.
In the upper school, for 14 to 18-year-olds, the emphasis shifts
slightly. Although they have the same class guardian for the four-year
period, they have a variety of other teachers for specialists subjects,
who form a team working closely together. While studying for GCSE,
Standard Grades, Highers and A-levels all pupils participate in the main
lessons as well as continuing a general programme of art, crafts or
drama. This is considered valuable in maintaining a good balance of
subjects and keeping examination work in perspective.
The vast majority of Steiner schools in other countries are
government-maintained or subsidised. In Britain, the schools have to pay
their own way, though the Government states it helps with funding
through the assisted places scheme. Each school is self governing and
independent, encouraging parental input and upholding a holistic,
child-centred curriculum which appeals to the heads, hearts and hands of
children worldwide.
The sentiments are admirable, but naturally, this system has its
critics. One constant accusation is lack of discipline, but this is
possibly inspired by the pupils calling teachers by their first names
and not wearing uniform. This hardly constitutes running riot and all
Steiner teachers underline the necessity of structure in successful
teaching.
The rarified air of the Kindergarten would not be suitable or
enjoyable for all children, although it is unquestionably a calm and
relaxing atmosphere. Even young children are aware of the world around
them, and the negating parts of this might not be the best way of
teaching them to cope with outside pressures. Most mainstream nurseries
and kindergartens pride themselves on producing what is certainly a
small--scale version of an adult world, but one the children manage
themselves, while always having the haven of a ''quiet corner''.
One self-confessed ''cynical high school teacher'' works in an area
where there is a Steiner school for children up to 14 but no upper
school. As a result the children have to be integrated into mainstream
education, where in the main they appear to be advanced creatively but
behind in the basics.
Adapting from one form of education to another presents difficulties
which can be worsened by feelings of inadequacy.
The teachers themselves are selected for training on an individual
basis, which does not necessarily include paper qualifications. Life
experience, enthusiasm and the ability to relate well to the pupils are
considered the most important qualities.
Advocates of the Steiner methods argue for pluralism in education.
Adaptability, independence and creativity are excellent qualities with
which to face the world on leaving school but for some children
traditional education is the best option.
Strangely enough, children can be desperately conformist, which must
be respected as much as being revolutionary.

HUDDLED over the tables in their school resource centre, which was
bedecked with the flags of the European Union, John Lynch's fourth-year
maths class at Cardinal Newman High School in Bellshill clearly enjoyed
the break from their Standard Grade revision, even if it didn't amount
to a change of subject.
They were taking part in ''Mathematiques sans frontieres'', an
international competition for fourth and fifth year pupils organised by
the Academie de Strasbourg. This year, 35 Scottish schools are involved,
mostly from Strathclyde but including five from Tayside.
When it started in 1990, the competition was confined to schools in
the Alsace region. Now 15 countries take part, contributing more than
45,000 pupils and 1800 classes.
Gerry Toner, principal teacher of guidance at Cardinal Newman,
organises the Scottish and Irish entries. ''I have sponsorship this year
of #2000 from Top Class Travel of Coatbridge and #1000 from BT,'' he
said. ''Each pupil who takes part will receive a small prize, and the
best three school entries will win #400, #200 and #100 respectively.'' A
trophy is awarded to the winning school, whose entry then goes forward
into the international arena.
''Mathematiques sans frontieres'' is a class competition, with only
one entry per class permitted. The test paper for fourth-year pupils
comprises 12 questions, one of which is written -- and must be answered
-- in a foreign language. Around an hour and a half is allowed for the
exercise. It is a demanding test and, in Gerry Toner's words, ''70% is a
very good score.''
This year's fourth question was one of the easier ones. ''In Baron
Munchhausen's castle the ballroom is a square of side 7m. In each of the
four corners of the ballroom is a square stove of side 1m. The remaining
floor area is covered with rectangular tiles which are 3m by 1m. Is it
possible to do this without cutting any tiles? Explain your answer.''
Indeed, most questions required an explanation of the answer. They
also demanded intense concentration and teamwork. Pupils were encouraged
to work individually or in groups, and to decide together at the end of
the test which individual answers would be used to constitute the
school's official entry.
Gerry Toner's advice to the Scottish schools was that ''the best
tactics are to allocate questions to groups''. John Lynch's class of 27
was therefore divided into six groups, each of which was to attempt four
or five of the set questions.
Though working in small groups seemed the most profitable way to
proceed, many pupils preferred initially to work on their own. However,
with teacher involvement forbidden, they regularly turned to one another
for advice and help, and quickly appreciated the value of working in a
cooperative manner.
Predictably, the two groups confronted with the question set in French
encountered most difficulty. ''We began by translating the question,''
said Gillian McLean. ''The problem was, we had to look up a number of
words, and even then we couldn't quite understand the concept, and lost
a lot of time through that. It's a pity, because I like French.''
David Hoolaghan's group, with no linguistic problems to resolve, was
making more rapid progress. ''This is very enjoyable,'' he said. ''It's
also relevant to our Standard Grade maths -- it's good for the reading
and application part. All the same, they're not the sort of questions to
which we can apply the formulae we've learned -- it's more about trial
and error.''
Carol Anderson, unused to working in a group situation, found it
stimulating. ''We've already done two of our four questions, and we're
halfway through the third. It's difficult, because it's about
investigation -- I prefer maths the straight way we do it, with no
twists. Still, this kind of investigation helps with our
problem-solving. Maths is good -- I'm going to take it when I go to
university.''
The Academie de Strasbourg issued a statement saying the objectives of
the competition are ''to favour teamwork and links between schools and
nations, to open up mathematics to foreign languages, to encourage
scientific vocations and in a small way to contribute to the quality of
maths teaching''. Gerry Toner, who started organising the Scottish end
of the competition three years ago, is convinced that its popularity
will continue to spread because of its relevance and its international
dimension.
Teachers and pupils passing through the Cardinal Newman resource
centre in both directions -- it serves almost as a right-of-way across
the school -- failed to disturb John Lynch's class. They were simply
absorbed in doing their humble bit to break down the frontiers of maths.

EARLIER this year Gillian Shephard, the Secretary of State for
Education, told the House of Commons that there was no research evidence
in this country to indicate that large classes mean lower education
standards.
Indeed some studies, Mrs Shephard has said elsewhere, have shown that
pupils studying in large classes do better than pupils in smaller ones.
Educationalists in favour of larger classes also cite the examples of
schools in South Korea, Japan, and the other high-achieving countries of
East Asia where classes often contain 40 or more pupils.
In the US, however, a study of 7000 pupils in 79 schools has been able
to show that younger children in smaller classes will outperform those
in larger ones. Denmark, France, Germany and many other European states
have also recognised the educational benefits of small classes by
imposing maximum class-sizes of between 25 and 30 pupils.
Yet in the United Kingdom, where financial pressures are forcing
education authorities to look at ways of increasing the efficiency of
their schools, the trend is towards bigger classes.
In England, where there is no legal limit on the number of pupils in a
class, parents' groups have been voicing their concerns about the
growing size of classes.
In Scotland, where the maximum class size is 33, there is also concern
that financial constraints are forcing schools towards bigger classes.
Teachers, in inner-city schools in particular, say that bigger classes
are making it more difficult to cope with the large number of pupils
they encounter with learning and behavioural problems.
Parents, and indeed the pupils themselves, are also convinced that
smaller classes mean more effective learning. A preference for smaller
classes, and more teacher-help, is one of the reasons why a number of
parents are taking their children out of state schools and enrolling
them in independent ones.
Advocates of smaller classes also point out that teachers in countries
like South Korea and Japan, and also in East Europe and Russia, can only
tolerate large classes by clinging to outdated teaching methods.
In Japan, the country most often cited in the argument for larger
class-sizes, teachers expect all pupils to learn at the same pace and
there is little or no time to provide additional help for slower
learners.
The growing problems of truancy and bullying in Japanese schools is
now being linked to the country's formal teaching methods and the lack
of opportunities for helping pupils with learning difficulties.
In South Korea the demand for high-quality engineers, and managers is
encouraging a move away from formal teaching methods. The new methods,
which seek to develop pupils' analytical and critical thinking skills,
will be accompanied by a move to smaller classes.

THE Government last night acted to help students with disabilities and
learning difficulties, as it beat off attempts in the Commons to broaden
its package aimed at tackling discrimination against the disabled.
Minister for Disabled People William Hague, speaking during the
Disability Discrimination Bill's report stage, disclosed a review of
arrangements for such students.
It would look at improving facilities, raising awareness of their
needs and giving incentives to colleges to enrole more of them.
Amendments would be brought forward to the Bill in the Lords to
achieve greater access to ''mainstream schools'' and make the further
and higher education sectors more responsive to their needs.
This would strengthen the current requirement for schools to have a
published policy for special education to make it include admission
requirements, steps to avoid discrimination and special facilities to
increase access to schools.
The announcement came as MPs who complain the Bill does not go far
enough backed moves to introduce additional provisions to secure rights
for the disabled, but these were defeated in a series of votes.
Meanwhile, disabled rights activists demonstrated outside Downing
Street, where they put up a symbolic wheelchair ramp.
The Bill makes it unlawful to discriminate in connection with
employment and provision of goods, facilities and services, and sets up
a National Disability Council to advise ministers.
However, Opposition parties demanded broader measures including a
Disability Rights Commission with power to vigorously enforce
anti-discrimination laws.
Labour disabled rights spokesman Tom Clarke said that, without such
powers, the Bill would have no teeth.
''The first test of a good law against a bad law is whether it is
enforceable. This Bill as it stands fails to pass that test.
''Disabled people should have more than just law on their side, they
should have law enforcement.''
Tory ex-Minister Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) warned: ''If we
don't have either a Disabled Rights Commission or a strengthened
National Disability Council, then there will remain a hole in the heart
of this legislation.''
However, Mr Hague insisted the Government's proposals would provide
the assistance that disabled people would need ''without setting up the
centralised, bureaucratic monitoring and policing body'' proposed by
Labour.
''Another policing body could well prove to be counterproductive,'' he
said.
A Labour proposal to require the Government to provide financial
assistance to firms with fewer than 20 employees ''to enable them to
meet their obligations under this Act'', was rejected by 297 votes to
267, a Government majority of 30.
Junior Employment Minister James Paice defended exemption of such
firms from the Bill's provisions, but pledged that the Government would
table an amendment in the Lords requiring Ministers to review the
operation of the exclusion of small businesses within five years.

THE Government was accused yesterday of frustrating Scotland's
economic recovery by underfunding transport and by a laissez-faire
approach to its development.
Scottish chambers of commerce, concerned at lost business
opportunities at home and abroad, will underline their criticisms on
Thursday as hosts of a national transport conference designed to be a
catalyst for recovery.
They will highlight limitations and deficiencies in transport
infrastructure, and demand the Government produces a cohesive,
integrated policy for Scotland's road, rail, sea, and air links.
Mr Geoff Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,
warned yesterday that the Government would ignore at its peril the call
for reforms among the Scottish chambers, which have almost 9000 members.
The conference, Getting Transport Moving, aims to produce a blueprint
for the infrastructure required for an integrated transport system.
Its benchmark will be the systems already in place in the EU and
further afield and which are said to damage Scotland's ability to
compete in the single European market or beyond.
Some 500 people are expected to take part in the debates, including
users, providers and operators, and it is hoped to identify the critical
elements and strategic solutions required to produce an integrated
transport system.
Their views will be included in a document, which will take four weeks
to prepare, for submission to the Government, Euro and UK MPs, councils,
and interested groups.
Mr Runcie confirmed the conference is expected to call for an
upgrading of the West Coast main line as a key rail artery, not only for
business but tourism.
In a reference to Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney's recent
invitation for ''humungous ideas'' from interested parties, he added:
''He should show he means what he says by listening carefully to the
voice of Scottish business . . .
''It is saying quite clearly that Government policy has not delivered
the prosperity it should have to Scotland, and our recovery at home and
abroad can only be led by Scottish business if a cohesive, intermodal
transport infrastructure is in place.''
Ironically, Mr Runcie was unaware that Europe's new Transport
Commissioner, Mr Neil Kinnock, was in Glasgow yesterday for a keynote
speech on road safety.
The visit provided an ideal opportunity to lobby for EU support prior
to the conference, described as a watershed in developing Scottish
transport policy and needs.
Mr Kinnock told The Herald later that transport in Britain over many
years had not attracted the level of investment required in a modern
country which needed ''security, efficiency, and to enhance
competitiveness''.
He added: ''The transport system is the artery and veins of a nation.
We are now suffering from preventable sclerosis . . . paying for
monumental under-investment.''
Mr Kinnock said the railways in particular were ''paying dearly'' for
continued neglect of the network.
The EU was supporting the concept of upgrading transport links across
member states, with economic competitiveness and a safer environment
central to considerations.
Sir Alistair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, will make the keynote
speech at Thursday's conference. The guests at workshops include
ScotRail's new director, Mr John Ellis, and Mr Matthew Hudson, chairman
of Prestwick International Airport.

THE Liberal Democrats yesterday unveiled radical plans to decentralise
councils they win control over in next month's local government
elections.
Describing the policies as ''a popular vision that works well, with a
proven record,'' the party in Scotland promises to set up area councils,
or committees, with local geographical control over budgets and services
based on party shares of votes.
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said his party had
a proven track record of opening councils to public scrutiny, handing
power to local people. ''This gives the public effective and responsive
local government, and opens up town hall doors to public scrutiny and
participation, he said.
''Our attitude could scarcely contrast more with the climate of
mushrooming quangos under the Tories. Labour's fear of openness is well
known -- in councils all over Scotland, Labour shut the public out of
meetings on all subjects.''
Meanwhile, candidates from three of the four main parties fighting the
elections in Central region have signed a charter guaranteeing no
compulsory redundancies following the local government shake-up.
The charter, backed by seven trade unions with members in local
government, and including Unison, the Fire Brigades Union, and the
Educational Institute of Scotland, was launched by the depute general
secretary of the STUC, Mr Bill Speirs, at a conference in Stirling
yesterday.
The conference was told that nearly 50 of the 196 candidates for seats
on the three shadow councils of Stirling, Clackmannan, and Falkirk had
already signed, with new names being added constantly.
Trade union members are being urged not to vote for candidates who
refuse to sign, with the names of those who have agreed being circulated
to 17,000 local authority staff.
Unison representative Val Hendry said candidates from the Labour
Party, the SNP, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party had
all backed the charter.
Mr Keith Harding, Tory leader of Stirling District Council, said
Conservatives would not be signing and described the no redundancies
pledge as ludicrous.
Elsewhere yesterday, in the run-up to elections, Unison general
secretary Alan Jinkinson was in Glasgow to launch a #100,000 advertising
campaign.
It will involve a series of 600 billboard posters throughout Scotland,
and full-page advertisements in several Scottish newspapers -- including
The Herald.
Mr Jinkinson said: ''The campaign is about trying to get people to
vote, and to get them to think about the issues which directly affect
them.''
In the Highlands, the SNP is making a determined effort to establish a
strong group of councillors on the new single-tier Highland Council,
according to parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing, in Inverness
yesterday.
Mrs Ewing said that her party was taking the lead in the north: ''The
SNP is standing in 35 of the 72 seats for the new Highland Council, a
record number, and double the number of candidates that the Labour Party
is able to put up.
She said: ''The Tories have virtually disappeared from the Highlands,
and with only three candidates, they are facing extinction.''
Meanwhile, a leaflet explaining how the Government intends to limit
increases in Scottish business rates following next month's revaluation
has been published for distribution along with demand notices.
However, in Strathclyde at least, some notices have already been
issued, apparently in advance of the leaflets becoming available,
creating confusion among small businessmen who have not studied the
effects of changes.
Scottish spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, Mr Bill
Anderson, said yesterday of the issuing of the explanatory leaflet:
''Thank God for that,'' but went on to lament the sending out of demand
notices without leaflets.

THINGS are looking brighter on the franchising scene in Scotland: the
good news is that more start-ups survive pro rata than in the rest of
the UK.
It must be conceded however that there are fewer start-ups to begin
with but this is attributed to the natural canniness of the Scots, a
business quality rather than a defect.
Mr Mark Beaumont is a director of Franchise Events Limited which,
although based in Christchurch near Bournemouth, was originally set up
to organise a franchise exhibition at the SECC last summer. The
exhibition was so successful that another one is planned for June.
He believes there is great potential for franchising in Scotland,
particularly in the central belt where the highest population is
concentrated, despite the caution displayed by both franchisors and
budding franchisees.
He says: ''At last year's exhibition there were 39 franchise
opportunities. This year I am hoping for 45 plus.'' More and more
companies are advertising north of the Border and so far there is more
interest than last year.
''I am convinced that Scotland could be better at it than the rest of
the country. In the South-east, they tend to go to exhibitions and throw
their money away. The Scots are more prudent, they ask intelligent
questions and take it very seriously. In almost every case, they are
more successful than the rest of the country.''
One problem, however, is an apparent lack of franchising information.
Mr Beaumont adds: ''This was a major concern which emerged at last
year's exhibition. For people who have been employed all their lives, it
is difficult to imagine being self-employed. They need sound advice and
most do not know where to look for it.''
This problem should now have been resolved. A network of Scottish
Business Shops was officially launched in Glasgow last week to
supplement the services already offered at the branch in Bothwell
Street. Glasgow now has six additional high street outlets allowing
access to a database of franchising opportunites, a set of UK and
international franchise directories, and offering a free counselling
service.
Around 30 more have opened or are about to open around Scotland,
including: Ayrshire, the Borders, Fife, Forth Valley, Grampian,
Lanarkshire, Lothian and Tayside. A freefone number is also to be set
up.
Mr Raymond Blin, managing director of Format F, a specialist company
set up to advise on franchising and an associate of Pannell Kerr Forster
(Chartered Accountants), Carlton Place, Glasgow, is optimistic about the
future and speaks of an explosion of opportunities in the next few
years. He adds: ''We have set up recently a franchise training and
learning programme and we have spoken to the LECs and TECs about running
these with them. The response has been overwhelming.''
''A lot of people have not thought of franchising as a business
development option, either because they don't know what is meant by it
or because they associate franchising with fast food. But almost any
good business can be franchised as a means of expanding.''
According to the International Franchising Association in the US, one
new franchise opens every eight minutes of the business day. If history
is anything to go by and what happens there today happens here tomorrow,
Scotland can look forward to a bright franchising future.
IAN Swan and his wife Pauline became successful franchisees with
Kall-Kwik, a printing company, 16 years ago. They run an outlets in
Edinburgh. Its parent company is Kwik-Kopy whose headquarters is in
Houston, Texas and which has sold licences in Canada, South Africa,
Israel and the UK.
Now about to sell the business and retire, Mr Swan points out that
self-employment, even with efficient back-up from a well-established
company, is not an easy option.
He says: ''You need your eyes open and your wits about you and it
helps if you are not just one person as there can be problems in the
early stages.
''But one major advantage of being a franchisee is the back-up you get
from the franchisor.
''In the case of Kall-Kwik, this covers comprehensive and intensive
initial training over about three months, followed by continuing support
from skilled and highly qualified people in the technical, marketing and
accounting areas.''
Mr Swan explains why he chose self-employment and offers some useful
advice for prospective franchisees.
''It is important to buy an ethical franchise; make sure it's good
quality; beware of get-rich-quick schemes; and talk to people who have
done it. It has been hard work for us but at the end of the day, you get
out of it what you put into it.''

The Government was urged last night in the Commons to block the sale
of a disused airbase to the Maharishi Foundation.
Labour MP Jamie Cann told the House that Ministers should not allow
the site to pass into the hands of the foundation, which wanted to turn
the RAF Brentwaters Base into a 4000-place university.
However, Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames defended the proposed
sale and dismissed the view that the foundation was ''in some way an
undesirable organisation''.
Mr Cann, MP for Ipswich, claimed in the House that the foundation had
been responsible for people developing mental and physical problems.
''I cannot believe that the Government can dream of doing this,'' he
said.

Scottish Secretary Ian Lang may well have overlooked the fact that the
break-up of Strathclyde region could be an open sesame to criminals. Ken
Smith reports
CRIMINAL gangs controlling multi-million pound empires of drugs and
counterfeit goods will be ready to exploit any weaknesses thrown up by
the dismemberment of Strathclyde region.
Obviously, these were not the supporters Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
had in mind when he decided to split up the regional councils, but there
are fears that the expertise built up by Strathclyde's consumer and
trading standards officers could be lost.
Some of the routine work of the department can seem quite pleasant --
weighing guide dogs for the blind, for instance, to ensure they have not
become too fat; buying a beef curry to check that it is beef and not
mutton; or ordering up a whisky in a bar to see if the measure is large
enough.
But there is a darker side to its work. Complex surveillance of
illegal money lenders who prey on the poor; following counterfeit goods,
financed often by the profits of drug dealing which can cost legitimate
traders hundreds of jobs; and taking on crooked car dealers who sell
death traps created from the wrecks of other cars.
Such operations not only take up time and money, but can involve a
large number of trading standards officers who are experts in their
field.
By next April, the department could be split into 12 among the new
councils covering Strathclyde, and many of the new departments would be
too small to mount operations which can not only save the public large
sums of money, but even lives.
The crooks themselves, not all stupid people by any means, will be
aware that there are areas with less protection than others, and could
begin to move their operations in the hope of evading detection.
The service, which prides itself on working with legitimate traders to
ensure the public is protected as much as possible while committing
itself to rooting out the criminals, may simply retreat until it is
doing little more than reacting to specific problems, leaving the public
less protected.
Mr Bruce Collier, director of consumer and trading standards at
Strathclyde, warned: ''I am sure the criminal fraternity will exploit
any weaknesses which appear. The crooks and the rogues will be quick to
react if there are areas, and I hope there won't be, where standards
slip.
''People move to where there is less enforcement. We had a trader in
Glasgow selling crooked timeshare and package holidays. He was
prosecuted and went bust. He was a real evil character -- threatened to
break the legs of my staff.
''Now you can't sell dodgy timeshare in the streets of Strathclyde. We
have dealt with the rogues and educated the public. He has moved on,
though, to an area of England where he thinks it will be easier.''
It is not that the trading staff themselves will be any less
professional, but slicing the manpower and resources into 12 will be the
problem. ''Simply following someone by car can take a minimum of three
to four people mobile in their own vehicles in radio contact. Many of
these new authorities will simply not have the numbers of staff
available with these skills,'' says Mr Collier.
Even if they did, there is the problem of boundaries. ''At the moment,
of course, officers are operating throughout Strathclyde. In the future,
say, an officer in Renfrewshire checking on counterfeit goods will have
to contact Inverclyde to go into its area, and that could prove
bureaucratically difficult. It could mean that our flexibility
disappears,'' he said.
The new boundaries do not just affect crooks. Legitimate traders
constantly contact the department for information and guidance about
what is allowed by law, and what new European legislation may mean.
Often it is an area of interpretation. The last thing a company with a
series of outlets in the West of Scotland wants is contradictory advice
from the various new councils.
Strathclyde's present size also gives trading standards officers
sufficient clout when dealing with national and international companies.
''In the Hoover free flights case, we had the expertise and knew the
scale of the problem, and took it on to get redress for people. If the
new councils don't have the clout, then the public will lose out, and
lose out badly,'' he argued.
Other organisations appear to agree that the size of Strathclyde's
department has helped. FACT, the film industry's arm which investigates
counterfeit taping, says that Strathclyde trading standard are the most
effective in the country.
In advertising, the department's advertising monitoring unit works
closely with agencies to ensure that their output conforms to legal
standards. An Office of Fair Trading report shows that compliance levels
in Strathclyde are far higher than nationally.
Again, this expertise could be lost.
There is one way it could be retained which will have to be discussed
by the new councillors. Trading standards officers work closely with the
police on many investigations. There will still be one police force for
Strathclyde, handled by a joint police board with representatives from
the 12 new councils.
The suggestion is that trading standards, because of the success of
its Strathclyde-wide remit and its involvement with the police, should
also be controlled by the police board.
But even if the councillors agreed, Mr Lang may try to scupper it.
After all, he did not go to all the bother of dismantling Strathclyde to
see parts of it being recreated almost immediately -- even if it was for
the good of the public.

Nic Outterside reports on the political
revolution which is beginning to take
place in the South-west of Scotland
A POLITICAL revolution is taking place in South-west Scotland and
supporters believe it could sweep the country.
Against national trends, Independent councillors are increasing their
control on local decision-making in the new unitary authority in
Dumfries and Galloway and they want to turn the political screw even
tighter.
Last May, in the regional council elections, the Independents
discovered a new unity under the former Labour parliamentary candidate,
Mr John Dowson, and deals were struck with the Liberal Democrats and
Scottish National Party to wrest control of the council.
Mr Dowson explained: ''People have become sick and tired of party
politics running their local councils and are more interested in local
issues.
''That is why our existing councils in Dumfries and Galloway are
dominated by Independents.''
The Liberal Democrats and SNP were rewarded for their co-operation
with the convenership and deputy convenership of the council and the
chair of the powerful social work committee.
It left the former Labour administration in the wilderness alongside a
three-strong Tory group.
Labour, which had dominated the council for the previous four years,
suffered internal rifts, while the leadership of its council group fell
to a caucus of left-wing councillors who refused to compromise with the
new administration.
Councillor Willie Scobie, the organiser of the group, said: ''There
was to be no selling out of principle for power.''
That was almost a year ago and now the number of seats up for grabs
has doubled from 35 to 70 and the Independents appear almost certain of
increasing their power base with 56 candidates in the contest.
Already they have nine councillors returned unopposed, while the
Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, and SNP have brought back a total of
13.
With 36 seats the target for control of the council, no group except
the Independents can achieve that goal. Of the seats left, Labour
contests 25, the Tories 16, the Liberal Democrats 14, and the SNP 23. Mr
Scobie believes the key skirmishes will occur in Wigtownshire.
Mr Scobie and Councillor Tommy Sloan appear certainties to hold their
seats at Knockcullie and Castle wards on the strength of their previous
votes and strong personal followings.
In the Aird ward the Labour Party has dismissed the challenge of Mr
Colin Arkless who stands on an Independent Labour ticket as ''nothing to
do with us'' and predicts that Mr Robert Higgins for the SNP will
''probably win''.
An interesting fight is in store in the Inch ward where district
councillor Davina, Countess of Stair, faces a challenge from Mr
Higgins's daughter Kathryn (SNP) and local government officer Mr William
Forrest for Labour.
Mr Forrest took Countess Stair to within 33 votes in the 1988 district
council elections and Mr Scobie says the ''landed aristocracy'' could
end up with egg on their faces this time.
The strength of the SNP's Christine Hutchison's following in
Penningham should be too much for the solitary challenge of Dr John
Marshall's one-man Mid Galloway Renaissance Movement. Mrs Hutchison is
already being tipped as the best SNP prospect to face Mr Ian Lang in the
next General Election.
Dr Joan Mitchell should also win the Cairnsmore seat for the Liberal
Democrats after convincingly beating the SNP's Alex Nisbet during last
year's regional council elections.
However, the crunch contest will come in the Cairnpat ward where
controversy surrounds three of the five candidates.
Former SNP councillor Mr Jim Heron -- who fell out of favour with his
party after backing a candidate against it during the last election --
stands as an Independent but still has nationalist support after
internal rifts saw the eleventh-hour withdrawal of official SNP
candidate Mr Hugh Scott.
Meanwhile, Mr George Park, a Conservative Party branch chairman is
standing as an Independent against official Conservative candidate Mr
Billy Wallace -- who has previously stood as an Independent.
Elsewhere in the region councillors Mr Tom McAughtrie (Ryedale), Mrs
Sheila Howat (Cargen), Mr John Forteath (Marchmount) -- all Labour --
should comfortably win, while council convener Mr Allan Baldwick
(Kirtle) and Mr Dowson (Dargavel) should do the same for the
Independents.
Mr Douglas Yule, the SNP's regional convener, agrees that the
Wigtownshire contests will be the most fascinating and predicts an
increase in his party's representation to double figures.
''The coalition with the Independents has worked well, and it is no
secret that we wish to work towards a further liaison,'' he says.
A deal with Labour was also ''not out of the question'' but Mr Yule
said that any working relationship with the Tories was a
''non-starter''.
But it is Mr Dowson's Independent group who have most to smile about.
''About 95% of Independents standing this time are allied to our
group,'' he claims.
''Each is standing to represent a community rather than party
politics, but we have gathered together as a group to share information
and help each other for strategic reasons on the council.
''I hope to call a meeting on April 7 and, with between 26 and 30
councillors in place, have the largest group on the new council.''
''Our message to the rest of Scotland -- particularly the Central Belt
-- is to leave party politics behind and elect councillors who really
represent your community,'' he added.

ALEX SALMOND seems to be adopting a ''spray-on'' style of politics --
firing in all directions in the hope that something will stick (March
20). The major disadvantage of this approach is that factual accuracy
might be called into question.
Specifically, his comments about East Kilbride District Council and
the representation of opposition councillors on its main committees are
wrong. To use this false statement to raise the more general question
about stewardship is first of all mischievous in the extreme but,
secondly, also reveals a degree of desperation in seeking support for
his party.
To answer his point, opposition councillors are represented on all the
council's main committees, and if Alex Salmond had bothered to check up,
all the opposition councillors are in fact on the major policies and
resources committee, the principal policy-formulating committee within
the council.
It's a pity he didn't mention this; it is also a pity that he failed
to mention that his two SNP councillors didn't even manage to turn up at
the most important budget meeting in the council calendar year to argue
for their party or properly to represent their constituents.
If ever there was an example of dereliction of duty then surely this
was a glaring one, and in the context of Alex Salmond's more general
comments, a bit of an own goal.

Leader of the Council,

JAMES SCOTT and Frederick Jenkins write about the significance of the
1979 referendum result (March 7 and 15). Even had Labour's devolution
proposals received 100% support, there would still be no Scottish
parliament because the eight-month period between the referendum (March
1979) and the five-year statutory limit to that Government's life
(October 1979) was inadequate for the establishment of a Scottish
parliament. About 18 months would have been required, according to the
current Shadow Secretary, George Robertson.
This must have been known by the Labour Government of the day, thus
confirming Mr Jenkins's view that the referendum was indeed a huge
confidence trick.

IAN LANG is reported as saying that a vote for Labour was a vote to
strip councils of power (March 21).
This is rich coming from a man who has 86% control of council funding,
who is taking water services, sewerage services, children's panels, and
assessors departments away from councils and is forcing joint boards for
police, fire, and transport, plus joint arrangements for who knows what
else within his new idea of how local government should be delivered.
Also he is the man who has lorded it over compulsory competitive
tendering, threatening thousands of jobs and services to people who need
it most; who has defended the poll tax, wasting thousands of millions of
taxpayers' money; and who has transferred thousands of miles of public
road from local authorities to his own Scottish Office.
To use Mr Lang's own parliamentary language, he is being economical
with the truth.

YOU reported the efforts to stop a Conservative MP from going bankrupt
(March 25). If the Conservatives lose, the Government's majority could
be down to 10.
You also reported the #16m debt the Conservative Party itself has,
#14m of which is being taken care of by a Scottish bank, the Royal.
We have the bizarre situation of a bank based in Scotland keeping an
English-based party, the Government party, from itself going bankrupt.
This is a serious situation which should be of concern not only to all
who have an account with the Royal but all those who work for it and do
not share the political support of the head of the Royal, Lord Younger.

BRIAN MEEK is regarded, not just by himself, as a leading Scottish
Conservative. As part of that albeit small select group, he has the
opportunity to use the ample space afforded him in The Herald to explain
the Conservatives' policies for the next century, to highlight Tory
plans for Scotland's capital city or, indeed, to put forward his
personal vision for the future of local government.
But no. Once more he sinks to what he does best, dealing in
tittle-tattle (March 23). He tells us that the socialists in Edinburgh
have already declared themselves winners of the April elections and that
the key positions in the new shadow council have all been decided.
Wrong again. The Labour Party does not take it for granted that we
will win Edinburgh. We hope to, we believe that our policies strike a
chord with the Edinburgh electorate, but we are fighting for every vote,
targeting crucial marginal wards and working flat out until 9pm on April
6 to try to secure victory.
What happens after April 6 depends, of course, on the result. No doubt
there is speculation about who will fill which position. If Labour wins
there will be a talented team of experienced and capable councillors
from district and region working together to take our city forward. They
will be judged, not on which council they come from, but on their ideas
for the future.
There are still two weeks to go to the election. Perhaps the Colinton
Conservative councillor, for that is how he describes himself on the
ballot paper, can give us a more principled view of how his party now
stands on the local government issues of the day.
I for one would be delighted for him to tell us how his party intends
to cut the council tax by #121 per head and still provide nursery
education for all three and four-year-olds and better services for all.

With the advent of the new councils, David Ross highlights the fact
that 7% of Scottish voters must choose between their jobs and serving as
councillors
AS Scots prepare to express their single-tier will on April 6, a
thought should be spared for the 280,000 people, 7% of Scottish voters,
who are having to choose between their jobs and the exercise of normal
rights as a citizen in a participative democracy.
The problem is particularly pronounced in the Highlands where 8.3% of
the electorate are prevented from serving as a councillor on Highland
Council, because they are council employees at either regional or
district level. Here, geography denies them other options.
Those who stand regardless and win, will have a year to decide. When
the new council takes over next spring, it is their job or their seat.
One who is not standing is Mr David Stewart who is chair of Highland
Regional Labour Party and the party's election co-ordinator in this
local campaign. Mr Stewart, who twice stood as Labour's parliamentary
candidate against Sir Russell Johnston, is an area manager in Highland
region's social work department.
He is also a councillor on Inverness District Council. He said
yesterday he was just one of 14,000 people in the Highlands who were
caught by their jobs. This meant a serious ''democratic deficit'' in a
council area where the electorate is just 168,000.
''In the Central Belt there are people in the same position, but they
have the opportunity to move through boundaries, move jobs, a mile here
a mile there -- it can still be possible to stand for the new
authorities.
''If you live in Glasgow and work in Greenock you can still do it
because there are different authorities involved. In Highland you can't
really do that with Moray 40 or 50 miles to the east and with the
Western Isles or Orkney being the next authorities to the west and
north. It is not really on, is it?
''Apparently, it is all right to own a company which does business
with the council, but if you work for a couple of days as a home-help
you have a conflict of interest. It doesn't make a lot of sense.''
The SNP's campaign co-ordinator is Mr Norman Will, a traffic warden in
the streets of Inverness for the past three years. Although a paid
employee of Highland Regional Council, he is determined to stand in the
Muirtown ward of Inverness.
He said: ''If I am elected, come March of next year I will have to
decide. I will have that year because the shadow authority won't employ
anybody until it takes over.
''Obviously, I hope that the rule will change before then. Unison is
taking a case to the European Court on this, so there is some hope. My
other option is that I look for another job. But I am standing partly as
a matter of principle and partly to highlight this situation whereby up
to 10% of the population is debarred.
''The people with private means are favoured which in turn favours the
independents. The health of our local democracy is not well served by
this.''
Another who is standing despite being debarred from serving is Mr Rob
Gibson. Mr Gibson is a national figure within the SNP, a member of the
party's cabinet. Locally, he is a serving councillor on Ross and
Cromarty District Council and a long-serving teacher at Alness Academy,
where he is principal teacher of guidance, an employee of Highland
Regional Council.
He is fighting the Invergordon seat on the council, regardless.
He said: ''There are a few of us in this position, but we feel it
important enough this time. We really have to give people the choice
because of the size of this new council which will go past the
millennium and, in effect, be a mini-parliament. If we are elected we
will not be able to keep our jobs and serve as councillors.''
The position is even worse in the Western Isles where 2300 of the
23,319 voters are either full or part-time employees of Comhairle nan
Eilean, the Western Isles Council.
At last May's council elections Mrs Christina MacNeil, the only
candidate for the Paible ward in North Uist, was disqualified because
she had provided emergency home-help cover for a few days during March
and April. Technically this made her an employee of the Comhairle during
the nomination period and therefore ineligible.
Mrs MacNeil subsequently stood at a by-election without impediment and
with success. She and her 29 council colleagues, and her counterparts in
Orkney and Shetland, now have until 1999 before they face another
election. Having been single tier for the past 20 years, the islands
councils do not have to undergo the all-purpose transformation the
mainland authorities now face.

ENDING all Scottish overnight seated accommodation trains to England
represents a milestone of railway contraction inflicted by this
Government and its aim of a slimmed-down network (March 24).
The enforced shedding of regular long-distance rail traffic from
arterial electrified routes on to parallel motorway buses represents a
major weakening of the cohesive Intercity system. It compounds the blow
dealt to Scotland with the already announced axing of all our Motorail
and ''marginal'' Glasgow/Edinburgh and Fort William sleeper trains.
Even that supremo of railway executioners, Dr Beeching, would be
astounded by the Government's fiddled figures, employed to compel BR to
withdraw from its core routes with mass market opportunities where rail
could outperform its rubber-tyred rivals.
Lost customer loyalty to BR will of course be doubly welcome by the
fleets of express bus operators who will appreciate the unexpected gift
of new, all-year-round night-time business. Many travellers can be
expected also to desert BR's remaining day-time services offered at
significantly higher fares.
Once started, the cycle of contraction tends to feed on itself in the
futile search for a profitably shrunken network of well-used routes.
The threatened trains could be retained if Ian Lang was prepared to
turn his alleged support into a resignation issue. Some formula would
soon be found to retain and even encourage BR to expand its overnight
services as a way of making greater use of our national assets.

BECAUSE of the hype over Swing Hammer Swing by Jeff Torrington -- both
the glowing reviews of it and the decision by BBC Scotland not to
commission it for the screen -- I couldn't wait to see the stage version
at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow.
What a disappointment. Am I the only person to consider it to be a
self-indulgent nostalgia trip by Jeff Torrington?

THE Scottish Arts Council meets on Thursday to review its decision to
axe funding to the Brunton Theatre in East Lothian. This irrational
decision has caused outrage within the industry and East Lothian and
begs the question about yet another unaccountable quango. I sincerely
hope the SAC will see the light and reinstate the grant.
The Scottish Office has increased funding by 2.9% yet the Brunton
loses its entire #53,000 grant, with the obvious concern over job losses
and consequently increasing benefit claims.
This money could not be used more efficiently elsewhere, and its
withdrawal will have serious consequences for the credibility of the
Brunton with other prospective funders.
Over the years the democratically elected local authorities have
steadfastly supported the Brunton, only to be kicked in the teeth by the
SAC.
If the electorate in East Lothian is happy for the Brunton to be
supported, then the SAC should take account of that fact.
A Scottish Arts Council made up of elected representatives would not
have taken this decision, would be publicly accountable, and would be
answerable for all decisions. This must be the way forward for the
Scottish Arts Council.

OVER the past few years Royal Mail has successfully handled mail
generated by a number of share issues, including the privatised
electricity companies, BT, and British Gas, some of these issues
involving up to 50 million extra items of mail.
As an illustration of our continuing commitment to improving the
quality of the service we provide to our customers in Glasgow, we
recently invested #25m in a new hi-tech sorting centre, housing the very
latest in sorting technology.
I am aware, however, that during the recent Powergen share offer there
were instances where the high standards we are committed to were not
fully maintained, leaving a number of our customers disappointed. A full
investigation has been carried out and remedial action has been taken.
I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for these lapses.

THOMAS L INGLIS talks of the parsimony of the Government in funding
education, and as a more than competent college lecturer I'm sure he is
thinking principally of higher education (March 23).
I am sure students in Europe would like to be the recipients of such
parsimony. The grants given in Britain are much more generous than those
received by students in other European countries and would seem like
manna from heaven to our American cousins.
I need not elaborate on the fact that Japanese universities with
vastly larger numbers in lectures still manage to deliver an academic
excellence that puts our universities to shame.
Despite millions of pounds spent on higher education, Britain is
chronically short of engineers, mathematicians, chemists, and physicists
but is awash with students of social sciences, politics, economics,
knitting and crocheting, and media studies.
Scottish education was once proud of its international reputation, but
the Americanisation of British education, where degrees are awarded for
any kind of pseudo-intellectual waffle, means it is no longer worthy of
the high esteem in which it was once held.

SHEILA DOUGLAS in her article, Speaking of standard Scots (Education
Herald, March 21), is being less than honest when pointing out that
although she is Preses of the Scots Language Society the views advanced
in her article are of a purely personal nature.
The principal office bearers of any organisation have to accept any
public pronouncements will be linked to the body they represent. It is
only by virtue of the office held that their views are elicited in the
first place. One cannot be divorced from the other.
While I am happy to be associated with arguments in favour of a
standard literary Scots, I am not aware that there is anyone promoting
this concept who would call for a standard spoken Scots, even if such a
thing were possible. For Dr Douglas to claim otherwise is pure fantasy.
She also attempts to draw parallels with spoken English yet fails to
acknowledge that there is a standard and accepted written form of that
language whatever its dialectical speech forms may be. Why should these
rules, as applied virtually to every other language, not be relevant to
Scots?
I do not think Sheila Douglas could realise how apt her reference to
John Galt actually was, for above all else the characters in his novels
were masters of ironic, if unintentional, self-revelation. She does so
herself with the quote from Sheena Blackhall when claiming it is in
''Aberdeenshire Scots'', as if this were somehow at variance with the
mainstream literary medium.
On reading the passage I noticed just one minor Aberdeenshire feature
-- ''fite'' rather than ''white'' in a piece which is effectively
written in a near standard literary Scots.

SOME names on the weekend's football pools felt faraway. Accrington
Stanley was there. So were Horwich and Emley. Before the list reached
known addresses of elegance and excellence like Stenhousemuir and Alloa
stretched rolling English miles of dim landscape that included teams
called Droylsden and Athenstane. There was a United from Spennymoor.
All were stand-in names to fill the gaps in Saturday's football
geography.
All the grander gladiatorial contests had been called off because of
this week's international matches, an even greyer excuse for calling off
than the increasingly soft one of bad weather.
But even if every turnstile in the land stayed shut, a small shy band
of fans who would still find a game to go to. Distance is no object to
them. Times of kick-off matter not at all. Even expecting nothing much
to happen on the park fails to put them off.
Often enough they more than expect to be disappointed. They know they
will be. Because they tend to support teams who lost many more games
than they win, they await another doing. Besides, it has already been
written on the tablets that they will be gubbed again.
These gentle philosophers of the ball game enjoy their sporting life
quietly. They tend to be solitary fans. Although most of them do their
time on decrepit terracings, their real pleasure comes between
Saturdays. They follow their game in the evening stillness of public
library reading rooms. Their arena lies in old newspapers. They are the
football historians.
Where some of them meet every two months or so is in the cramped,
homely pages of the Scottish Football Historian. For 14 years it has
kept turning out, regardless of its small crowd. For a little magazine
that is a big, big run.
Like Accrington Stanley's inclusion on the pools, appearances have
been less than regular. If the editor is flitting his house, as he has
been, longer pauses occur between editions. Sometimes he allows his day
job as an accountant to interfere.
Most closely, however, the attention given by John Litster, founder
and editor, to his mag is linked to the fortunes of Raith Rovers. At 39
he is a long-time supporter. He wrote the history of the Rovers. And he
is a club director, if that counts.
His magazine's robustness and freedom from injury of spelling and
syntax follow inversely the ups and downs of his team. In this
glamorous, cup-winning season for them the ed's eye has now and again
been off his magazine. In the current number, however, game perseverance
has its reward.
By apt but sad coincidence the cover story matches the condition of
grief being experienced in the Scottish game.
A spare, lyrical article by David Allan, a frequent contributor, tells
the story of Hughie Ferguson, a tragic hero.
Playing centre-forward for Cardiff City, called the Bluebirds, in 1927
Hughie Ferguson by his boot won a place in British football that is
unique. For the only time the English Cup was taken out of England, and
he took it. Here's how:
''There were 17 minutes left to play as the blue-shirted
centre-forward collected the ball from a throw-in. He turned inside and
let fly a low, hard, diagonal shot from the edge of the area. Lewis in
the Arsenal goal had it covered but, no, the ball spun from his grasp,
his arms flailed, and then the ball was in the net . . . The FA Cup was
on its way to Wales,''
David Allan writes.
He is a Cowdenbeath supporter. At 38 he might be mature enough to know
better. A senior credit analyst with a bank, he must also be bright
enough. The truth is he seldom misses a Cowden game.
Like other scribes of his tribe, he hates to miss anybody's old goals.
He can inject into his prose a breathlesssness which suggests that in
the retelling of the biggest moment of the history of the Bluebirds, he
fears that Hughie Ferguson might shoot wide.
At the end of his career Ferguson played for Dundee. By then his
skills had aged. His goal-scoring touch had gone. Disappointed fans took
to jeering him.
Depressed, he stayed on alone one midweek night after evening
training. In the morning his body was found beside the gas ring in the
club tearoom. He was 34.
As at the funeral yesterday of David Cooper, there was a mountain of
mourning by the fans of the clubs Ferguson had played for. Mainly, he
had been a hero of Motherwell, his home-town team. In season 1919-20 he
put 33 goals in the pokey for the 'Well and 10 more the next year. They
made him Scotland's highest scorer.
Statistical achievements apart, how the Scottish Football Historian
keeps fresh his memory is by stray details uncovered in old newspapers.
When after many other offers -- and for a fee of all of #5000 --
Fergie in 1925 left Motherwell for Cardiff, worked stopped at Colville's
steelworks. Factory hooters gave his train a 21-toot salute.
Also unearthed by David Allan in an old newspaper is that the player
in his garden grew pansies, but only claret-and-amber flowers the same
colours as his team. So is he remembered.
And now all the papers have been saying that David Cooper will not be
forgotten. In an otherwise rough old game it is only the truth.

I WENT to the People's Palace and Winter Gardens in Glasgow with a
friend who requires a wheelchair. I had to park the car some distance
from the wheelchair access at the rear of the building and then abandon
my friend while I went looking for a parking space.
The 10 or so parking spaces within the grounds were full; none of them
reserved for people with mobility difficulties. The only reserved space
was for the very mobile curator.
The staff were courteous, sympathetic, and unhelpful. In the gardens
they assured me that parking was the responsibility of the museum while
the curator assured me the problem was the responsibility of the parks
department.
In wheeling my colleague through the gardens the wheels of the chair
toppled through the wooden slats of the hot-air vents. The place is a
serious hazard for anyone using a wheelchair and as a public amenity it
is a sad reflection of the way the city treats its less mobile citizens.

THE quality of debate on the issue of devolution in Scotland has been
pitiful. Ideological ranting has vied with opportunism and ill-informed
assertion for primacy. Those who are in favour of devolution argue their
case as if it were already established and working perfectly with every
potential wrinkle ironed smooth. Those who oppose it extrapolate from
fears rather than facts and construct monstrous edificies of anxiety
which depict Edinburgh's financial sector in ruins and Glasgow's
business community in smeared rags as vultures circle overhead. It is
all too ridiculous and it must stop before permanent damage is done.
Thankfully there are some cool and well-informed voices around who are
determined to present a more balanced approach. A good start has been
made by Professor Neil Hood's study of the potential effect of
devolution on inward investment. His credentials for attempting this
task are interesting. As an academic, he applies rigorous and properly
constructed methods to the question. Of relevance to the Scottish
business community is his time as director of Locate in Scotland and his
current business activities with Grampian Holdings, Shanks McEwan,
Kwik-Fit, and his role as strategy adviser to Scottish Power.
The icing on the cake for those wearied of partisanship is his
undoubted neutral political perspective, indeed his entire study seems
to go out of its way to exhibit a determination to steer clear of the
slightest hint of political partiality. Professor Hood's study is
limited to inward investment and has little or nothing to say about the
effects of devolution on indigenous companies. Nevertheless, there are
obvious parallels to be drawn between the operating conditions of all
companies in Scotland, no matter from where their central control is
derived. This is particularly relevant in the case of indigenous
exporting companies which operate alongside foreign companies which have
invested in Scotland with the specific intention of exporting throughout
the European Union. That raises the awkward question of a single
currency, but the study finds conclusively that the uncertainty
surrounding Britain's position on the issue far outweights that
associated with devolution. That is a point which this newspaper has
been making for some time. On the whole, Professor Hood's working paper
finds little to worry about as far as inward investment is concerned.
Tellingly, he points out that the proposed tax-raising powers of a
Scottish assembly would be of little weight compared with the really
serious variables, such as exchange-rate volatility, vagaries of market
demand, and shifts of technological advantage, with which any company
must already cope. Nor, it seems, would those tax-raising powers have
any serious effect in altering the factors which had already led to a
decision to invest in Scotland.
The burden of Professor Hood's study is that there are no strong
grounds for supposing that devolution, as it is understood at the
moment, is likely to have a negative effect on Scotland's position for
either inward investment attraction or development. The practical
application of this finding is that those who disagree must bring
forward opinion based on fact rather than assertion, and that those in
favour must develop their arguments a good deal further than has been
attempted thus far. An issue of this importance for our national life
requires a properly conducted debate. We have not had one as yet, but
Professor Hood's work at least provides a beginning.

SHARMAN Macdonald's two recent plays, The Winter Guest and now Borders
on Paradise indicate an escalation in her verbal impressionism. Maybe it
was always there, but I don't recall the ''tone poem'' quality of her
writing being quite so strong, nor, more worryingly, the dramatic
interaction being so minimal.
Certainly both her recent plays and the productions that have
accompanied them make one feel Macdonald has become a language
colourist, high on words and impressions. But does that always translate
to the audience?
Nobody captures adolescence the way Macdonald does or describes those
transcendent moments of being: wonder at nature, love, burgeoning sexual
attraction, spirtual yearnings that Macdonald clearly believes every
human being has within them. Her tenderness for her characters is truly
touching, her compassion infinite even when she's showing them at their
worst.
Borders of Paradise is a tumult of impressions -- snapshots you might
say, in designer Emma Donovan's white border surrounding a rocky,
supposed to be Devon, cove set in which five young male surfers and two
young Scottish girls eye each other from a distance before, near the
end, tentatively beginning to make contact.
Sometimes the sense of revelry and spinning phrases almost bring the
play to a shuddering stop. At others, there's a real sense of dramatic
tingle as director Lou Stein ingeniously realises the danger and
physical thrill of surfing on stage.
There is a stunning passage too, in which a young Asian, Cot,
describes his technique of self-inflicted pain as a way of overcoming
and transcending racism. Borders of Paradise so nearly reaches the
stars; I just wish Macdonald could bring her protagonists more
finger-tippingly close to each other more often.

STUTTGART is a city once famous for its chamber orchestra. And still
famous for its opera company. But its symphony orchestra, on Sunday's
evidence, belongs to a more provincial league. Launching a British tour
in Edinburgh was doubtless depressing -- the audience small, the weather
dreadful, the acoustics tricky.
But surely not so depressing as to prompt such clumsy, ineffectual
performances of Mozart and Mahler.
Not even the presence of Barbara Bonney as solo soprano could cheer
things up, because the Mozart portion of the programme was so
ill-constructed. Concert performances of the Don Giovanni overture never
make much sense, because they require a different ending from the one
Mozart wrote.
But following this with the pristine motet, Exsultate Jubilate and
Susanna's Act Four aria from Figaro proved equally unrewarding, when
they were accompanied in such a generalised way by an orchestra far too
big for the music.
Bonney's singing, sweet and fluent though it was, failed to bind
together such a disparate Mozart selection. Nor could her contribution
to the finale of Mahler's Fourth Symphony rescue a performance that had
already been wrecked by an orchestra unable to integrate its wind and
string departments satisfactorily, and by a conductor, the Uruguayan
Carlos Kalmar whose interpretation was filled with crude gear-changes
and untidy phrase-ends.
Dvorak, Ravel and Sibelius may strike it luckier in Glasgow tonight.

DID Phil leave Sunday's audience still begging for more or did he
leave them feeling that they hadn't been given enough? He did leave them
after less than an hour, you see, which was a wee bitty on the short
side. But hey -- when you've been favoured with even a nano-second of
Phil's unique mirth-mongering, mightn't asking for extra helpings be
asking for too much? I mean, no-one demanded that Isosceles come up with
a rectangle, did they?
In all probability, Phil himself is the only one who knows most of the
answers to some of these questions. All we, Phil's laughter-lieges, can
do is request that he stretch himself a bit and expand some of his
dazzling comic insights.
On Sunday, for instance, free-wheeling Phil's ever-colourful word-play
led to the invention of a maroon island -- truly a weird place upon
which to be deserted -- but instead of forming the centre of an
indispensable routine, it was all-too-quickly dismissed with throwaway
ease.
Yet while there were other rich seams which Phil didn't fully mine,
either, there was much of genuine brilliance at which to guffaw.
Has anyone other than Phil Kay ever spotted the links between drowning
men, lettuces and the Titanic? Has anyone else ever discussed the
reasons why Welshmen make unconvincing drugs barons and pimps? Has
anyone else pondered the musical consequences resulting from the chance
meeting in 1966 between Roger Earth, Derek Wind and Dave Fire at
Oswestry Further Education College? In short, how many funnymen are as
funny as Phil Kay?

THE plot is as eclectic as any bill for the variety theatre it
simultaneously celebrates and satirises; songs and dance aplenty, fraud
and farce, murder most foul, necromantic dealings, and Christian
proselytising and humour. Lots of humour.
Writer David Kane spins together his disparate elements with beguiling
skill. The script combines a salty, gallus directness with sophisticated
word play and dazzling originality.
Every one of the unsavoury theatrical types who people the seedy
sixties boarding house of Miranda Husk (Elaine C Smith in full, blousey
sail) is evoked with distinct individuality and idiosyncratic detail,
eg, the German-Scots of illusionist-cum-euthanasist Herman Katz (Forbes
Masson being sizzlingly smirky -- ''I vil dispose of ze bodies and gie
masel' a few days' grace'').
Kane brings an irreverent post-modern twist to even the most hackneyed
theatrical conceits. Jenny McCrindle's old lady disguise is madcap
Beetlejuice.
It's a heady concoction which could easily pitch into over-the-top
chaos but this Tron Theatre Company production is superbly directed with
cunning restraint by Michael Boyd.
The magnificent Jimmy Chisholm as Johnny Ramone cannot resist mugging
to the audience but no-one in the stellar cast tries to steal the
spotlight.
Every moment is a scene-stealer, from the moment Chisholm steps on
stage and limbers up his pelvis to the Las Vegas-style curtain calls
which were still spectacular, despite the technical hitch which
prevented Robert Paterson from making an airborne bow.
The production was still the best flight of fantasy I've seen for a
long time. Unmissable.

THE first international co-production in its six-year existence tops
the bill at the Scottish International Children's Festival.
The #100,000 project has been half-funded by the festival and is the
fruition of four years of discussions with Canadian company Theatre Sans
Fil. The company will use its internationally-acclaimed mix of giant
puppets, pyrotechnics, and other special effects to retell Scottish
myths and legends in the show, Crown of Destiny.
Three Scots puppeteers are working with the company in Montreal in the
preparation of the work, which will then tour Britain and Quebec. Dates
in the US are also planned.
Other international visitors to the festival at Inverleith Park,
Edinburgh, between May 22 and 28 are Theatre Kaze No Ko from Japan,
Australia's Victoria State Opera, making its European debut, and the
''inflatable comedy'' of American Fred Garbo.
Many of the shows -- including those of Scottish companies TAG,
Communicado, and Visible Fictions -- are touring as well as appearing in
Edinburgh, and for the first time the international programme will be
presented in Glasgow, at the city's Mitchell Theatre.
The festival has been able to peg prices for school parties at #2.50 a
ticket, and -- through a grant from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation -- offer
a 50% subsidy of transport costs. Already some 130 schools have made
bookings.
Tickets for the Edinburgh programme go on sale on Good Friday (April
14), through the festival's box office -- 0131 553 7700.

THERE seems to be little doubt that the world is warming. Scientists
believe it has become 0.5% warmer since the 1850s, and it will continue
to go on doing so well into the next century so that sea levels will
rise by as much as a metre by its end. There has been considerable
argument as to the cause, for historical evidence shows that the global
temperature has not remained constant over the millennia but has been
subject to fluctuation, though immensely slowly and over very long time
scales. Many observers believe, however, that the environmental impact
of modern industrial society has contributed greatly to the changes now
taking place; and that unless that impact is vastly reduced, if not
eliminated, things will only get worse, with an unfortunate consequence
for some particularly vulnerable communities fairly quickly and for all
mankind eventually.
On this view the main culprit is the emission of carbon dioxide gas
and the effect it has, through atmospheric pollution, in creating the
''greenhouse effect'', a global phenomenon whereby the whole planet acts
like a greenhouse, encouraging warmth but discouraging heat loss, and so
altering the balance of world temperature. There was enough in this
argument for the states represented at the Rio conference on climatic
change three years ago to agree to try to reduce the CO[2] emissions by
the end of this century. The outcome so far has been dispiriting. West
European states have been trying to stabilise emissions, but some
studies predict continuing growth of over 6% before the end of the
millennium and by a further 15% in the first 15 years of the new
century. The US and Japan have been particularly reluctant to initiate
any sustained programmes to cut such emissions (although American voices
have often been the most articulate proponents of the dangers of the
greenhouse effect) and the fast-developing states of mainland Asia claim
not yet to have the resources to do much. Besides, the matter is not yet
cut and dried -- for many it is a theoretical debate.
The UN's conference in Berlin this week seeks to further the Rio
agreement on global warming represented by the Framework Convention on
Climate Change. For some present yesterday it is hard to wait until the
carbon connections are all in place beyond dispute. The President of the
Maldives, a low island state in the Indian Ocean, pointed out that his
country could disappear. Other small Pacific states could follow suit.
The world's continents would be affected, if not to the same extent.
And, if the cost of introducing anti-pollutant measures now (on motor
car engine emissions, for example) is felt to be enormous, the cost of
sea defences will hardly be less. Already evidence is building up for
massive sea wall spending on parts of Britain's west coast whenever the
combination of high winds and high tides occurs.
Apart from the fears of global warming, there are many other good
arguments in favour of reducing the gas emissions which characterise
much of the industrial society of the developed world. The recent marked
rise in respiratory problems, including asthma among children, is a case
in point, as is the blight on trees from acid rain. Improvement can only
come by collective international action. The Berlin conference is right
on that.

Michael Tumeltytalks to a musical family on how they cope with the
pressure of bringing up their very talented teenage daughter
THE world of classical music can be a brutal environment for the
young, talented musician. The predatory machine of commercialism has
transformed the industry into a grotesque catwalk with fat tenors at one
end and sultry nymphettes with violins at the other.
There was young Nigel Kennedy, who grew a beard, an accent, a persona,
and eventually disappeared up his own image. And there is Vanessa Mae,
who has found herself being aimed at the charts and thrust thigh-deep
into the Mediterranean with a violin under her chin and a diaphanous
garment around her loins. God help you if you're young, gifted, and
discovered.
Melissa Forshaw, the hugely talented 16-year-old Glaswegian violinist
who will give a recital for the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society in the
Queen's Cross Church at Maryhill tonight, seems safe from predators.
She has a triple layer of protection from over-exposure. The
protection derives from her teacher, Russian violinist Lydia
Mordkovitch; from her father, a professional musician who knows the
business and its dangers; and from within herself -- she is untempted by
ambition.
Her story is a tale of a musical talent discovered early, but not
following the conventional path towards the profession. It's a story
that moves in leaps and bounds, with just a touch of fairy-tale magic.
''She's beyond her years,'' said her father, Brian Forshaw, shaking
his head in wonder as we listened to Melissa rehearsing Max Bruch's
First Violin Concerto. Brian has played for 20 years in the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra, in which he holds the post of associate
principal trumpet.
There is a luminous quality to Melissa's playing. It is free from
artificial intensity. It is so mature and rich that it prompts a stream
of questions: Where did this come from? Where did it all start?
Melissa remembers exactly the moment. ''I was about five. I went along
to the SNO Proms and saw three Japanese girls playing. Each of them
played a movement from Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto,'' she said. ''It
was the image of them standing there with their white dresses on. I
thought: 'That's me, I want to do that'.''
Lessons began at seven with a succession of teachers from Scottish
orchestras, and Melissa stormed through the exams set by the Associated
Board of the Royal Schools of Music, achieving a pass with distinction
at the top grade by the time she was 13. Meanwhile she had joined
numerous school orchestras and the National Youth Orchestra of Great
Britain.
Her parents had discussed with her the possibility of following the
orthodox route of the musically-gifted child: one of the specialist
establishments, such as the Menuhin or Purcell schools. Melissa was
adamant: ''I wanted to stay here. I felt happy at home, and I wanted to
work in Scotland.''
And her father was equally adamant that he wouldn't press her
otherwise. ''Melissa loves playing the fiddle, and she's talented, but
she's normal as well,'' said Brian Forshaw. ''We're trying to strike a
balance. I've seen so many of these soloists, when they turn up to play
with the SNO, who live completely for the instrument, and who are total
neurotics. If that's what Melissa wants to do, fine, but it's got to
come from her.''
So she attends normal school -- Fernhill in Rutherglen, where her mum
teaches music, and where Melissa is now in fifth year, limbering up for
a batch of Highers. But not music. She was so advanced that O Grade
music was mopped up in second year, and Higher in third. She couldn't be
fitted into the timetable, so lessons for these two exams were done with
her mum in the car on the way to and from school.
By now Melissa was becoming so advanced on the violin that her father
wondered what she should do next. He approached the violinist Lydia
Mordkovitch, who was appearing at the time with the SNO, and asked if
she would listen to Melissa, and perhaps suggest what direction she
might take.
Mordkovitch, who had been the star pupil of the great Russian
violinist David Oistrakh, agreed.
''I remember going to her hotel after school and playing some Bach, de
Falla, and Wienawski,'' said Melissa. She also remembers being stunned
when Mordkovitch announced immediately that she wanted to teach Melissa
herself. ''Can you start on Saturday?'' she asked the gobsmacked girl.
But Mordkovitch is resident in London, and lessons from high-powered
soloists don't come cheap. Enter fate. Melissa was competing in the Audi
Junior Musician competition. In this, preliminary rounds are held in
Audi showrooms around the country, progressing to a second round in a
stately home, and then to the final in London.
And after the second stage, held in Hopetoun House near Edinburgh,
came the phone call. ''A solicitor phoned us out of the blue,'' recalled
Forshaw. ''Somebody had heard Melissa in the Audi rounds, and at a
recital she'd given in Glasgow University. And they wanted to pay for
her to get lessons from a professional soloist.
''They insisted on anonymity. The solicitor told us if we tried to
find out who it was the payment would stop. End of story; I don't want
to know who it is.''
So for almost the last two years Melissa has commuted to London on
alternate weekends. Lessons are intensive, 2[1/2] hours at a time.
Melissa stays overnight -- ''Lydia gets me to help reorganise her
house'' -- and has a second lesson on the Sunday.
Mordkovitch carefully controls the girl's progress. ''She won't let me
do anything that pushes me to the edge,'' said Melissa. ''She makes sure
that everything I do is within my grasp.'' Some grasp. The girl's
repertoire now includes a raft of concertos by Mozart, Vivaldi, Bruch,
Saint-Saens and Prokofiev.
After the London Audi final which left Melissa disappointed -- she was
up against a Russian with a #50,000 violin -- Mordkovitch announced that
her pupil had to get a new instrument. Through a contact, Mordkovitch
arranged for Melissa to have, on loan, the French instrument once owned
by Carl Flesch, the great Hungarian teacher and violinist, born in 1873.
''It's amazing; the difference is immense,'' said Melissa. ''I don't
have to force so much to get the sound in my head that I imagine. It's a
fabulous tone. It just feels so right.'' The owner of the instrument
heard Melissa play on it and immediately offered it for sale to the
family. They are now in the process of buying it.
Big commitments, but still no pressure from Brian Forshaw. ''We don't
know how good she will get,'' he said. ''There's a dramatic difference
in her playing since she started with Lydia -- technique, confidence,
maturity of sound. But we've never pushed her, and Lydia doesn't push
her either. If Melissa walks in here and says she can't cope with
nerves, or she's had enough, then that's fine by me.''
And Melissa herself, practising up to six hours a day, has no specific
goal. ''I enjoy playing in public, but I've got no career planned out. I
just want to be the best I can, and see what the future brings. I feel
happy here. At school, my friends have come to accept that I don't want
to go out to night clubs till three in the morning . . . mind you, after
the Highers I probably will.''

Maryhill. Tonight, 7.30. Tickets #5.

Even in Shakespeare Jenny Agutter retains an aura of her railway age.
Mark Fisher reports on a labour of love
JENNY AGUTTER makes her entrance as the Princess of France in the
Royal Shakespeare Company production of Love's Labour's Lost standing on
a railway platform engulfed in a cloud of engine steam. It is a piece of
stage business, she says, that has nothing to do with her being cast in
the part. But for the original railway child the irony is not lost.
Twenty-five years on, Agutter knows she will be forever associated
with the classic British screen treatment of E Nesbit's family
favourite. It would not be unreasonable for her to resent the fact that
The Railway Children, a film she made at the age of 17 before starring
in Walkabout, An American Werewolf in London, Logan's Run and any number
of classical theatre pieces, should still be the thing that people
remember her by, but in fact the reverse is true.
She says it's absolutely to be expected that a film that has played
such a big part in so many childhood memories should continue to hold
its grip.
''I don't think of my films quite like a diary,'' she says, ''but they
do mark periods in my life. If I look at The Railway Children or
Walkabout, both come at very close times; one is about innocence, the
other about the loss of innocence -- and both of them I could never do
again. When people wonder if they should mention The Railway Children, I
say it's fine because that time doesn't come again, nor does that role
haunt me in any other way than it's something people recognise.''
If Agutter was ever to be irritated by the association it would have
happened by now. Thanks to a child-minding neighbour, The Railway
Children is currently enjoying an extended run in her own living room.
''He loves trains,'' she says about her four-year-old son Jonathan.
''Someone next door showed him the film, so we've got to have a copy
now. He's not interested in me. He looked at it one time and said,
'That's mummy when she was older'.''
Motherhood has, however, had a greater impact on Agutter than simply
noticing afresh the great comic performance of Bernard Cribbins and
being reminded repeatedly of the high-pitched teenage voice she once
had.
No longer living among the Hollywood high-fliers, dividing her time
between stage and screen, she has now all but deserted her home in Los
Angeles (earthquakes haven't helped), returned full-time to London after
more than a decade away and become altogether more cautious about the
kind of work she takes on.
The RSC Love's Labour's Lost, which opens at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre tonight, is her first stage role since more than a year before
becoming a mother on Christmas Day 1990.
''Motherhood doesn't suit certain aspects of acting,'' she admits.
''I've had to work my life out a bit more than I did. In the past I said
yes or no according to whether I felt like doing something, but now it's
a matter of whether it fits, whether it works, whether it's going to
upset the family, how it's going to balance out and just whether it's
possible.
''There are certain things that would not be possible in my life. It
would not be possible to do a West End run, for example. I would never
be there for bedtime, I would never be there for my husband . Doing
something like Love's Labour's Lost is wonderful, because it takes up a
particular period of time. My son will come up to Scotland with me and
will spend half the time when we go on tour to Japan.''
Perhaps not surprisingly, her return to the stage came hand-in-hand
with the biggest case of stage-fright she's ever had to cope with. Now
in her early forties, she says she is that much more aware of the
responsibility of a performer to carry the show, and even the knowledge
that she was playing opposite Sir John Gielgud at the age of 20 is
little consolation there.
Back into the swing of things, Agutter is enjoying the situation
comedy of Love's Labour's Lost, one of Shakespeare's most linguistically
playful romances. ''The modern setting frees up the comedy,'' says
Agutter about Ian Judge's production that has been updated from the
golden age of chivalry to the cricket pavilions of an Oxbridge
university circa 1914.
''Although the language is removed and much more full of images than
the language we would use, the setting does make people listen to it in
a different kind of way. There's one scene when two men are watching a
game of cricket. Now cricket to me is terribly funny because I've never
understood what's going on, so two men sitting there in deckchairs
talking about language actually works very well.''
The image of Agutter as a Brideshead-era princess is one that fits
comfortably with our idea of her as the well-to-do officer's daughter
whose name was made playing polite Home Counties girls on the big
screen, consolidated with classical roles at the National Theatre and
confirmed in various costume dramas such as the BBC's recent series The
Buccaneers. But Agutter's career has been broader than that -- and
perhaps, she now realises, a little too broad.
The trial last year of the two under-age killers of the toddler James
Bulger brought attention to the film Child's Play III, a horror yarn the
young boys were alleged to have seen and possibly been influenced by.
It's not a film that Agutter is familiar with, but she is distressed by
the fact that she did appear in the earlier Child's Play II, which, she
emphasises, has no connection to the sequel beyond the reappearance of
the central character.
''It's not the film that was seen by the children in the James Bulger
case,'' she says, ''but it did disturb me that it might have been. I
found the case terribly disturbing. In truth, those children should
never have seen it. It was an X-rated film, not intended for them.
''But given a choice in the future I really would steer clear of
anything where there was any doubt in my mind at all about the
repercussions of it. You don't know what people might imagine and you
just don't know what the future's going to be with those things. Now I
wouldn't do anything that in any way was going to contribute to that.''

Sara Villiers goes under The Arches to report on a new season of drama
ANDY Arnold, artistic director of The Arches in Glasgow, was cleary
enjoying the irony of announcing their new season the same day the
Scottish Arts Council lottery committee was briefing journalists on its
first round of grants.
Rumours had reached his ears that the committee considered The Arches
would be one of the companies to benefit.
''Well, we haven't applied yet, but we're very glad to hear that,''
Andy said as he all but grimaced a wry acknowledgement of the fact, that
when it comes to collecting dosh, the theatre has never been in front of
the queue.
Although they have established themselves as one of Scotland's most
tenacious and accomplished companies, The Arches' achievements have not
been fiscally rewarded.
Despite its continuing success, the theatre still has no annual grant
from the Scottish Arts Council and very little in the way of revenue
funding.
But there was some cheering news in last week's announcement -- The
Arches will receive arts council funding for a planned autumn production
of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari.
This, like 93's Metropolis will be a promenade production, staged in
the catacombs of arches at the back of the venue.
Other areas of the building are being colonised as the venue continues
to diversify.
The side arches, utilised for last year's production of The Crucible,
have been transformed into a 240-seat comedy venue, hosting visits from
Greg Proops, John Hegley and Phil Kay.
The Crucible returns for a Mayfest run, and the company is also
staging three absurd comedies by Chekhov -- The Bear, The Wedding, The
Proposal.
Not content with putting on a full programme, Arnold has decided to
further test his actors' resourcefulness and will attempt the
tension-inducing feat of having actors appear in both productions on the
same night.
Arnold, Arches-stalwart Andrew Dallmeyer and ''making her professional
debut'' Jayne McKenna, will feature in the Chekhov hat trick.
They performed pithy extracts from the plays to tantalise and delight
the assembled press, who were still gasping from the vodka toast Arnold
has insisted on.
Alongside their own shows, The Arches will be hosting Mayfest
productions by Wiseguise (Asylum! Asylum!) the New Playwrights
Initiative (On A Stone Bridge), Theatre Works Ltd (Edmond), KYBO (The
(In)Complete History of East Kilbride) and a reprise of Luckenbooth's
Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens.
The club nights, which have been so vital to the subsistence of the
venue, continue to play a major part in their programme with the
continuation of the popular Slam, Love Boutique, and Clockwork nights.
This will be supplemented by the return of the much-missed club
cabaret extravaganza, Cafe Loco, which will now be hosted by Nick
Peacock and Bobby Bluebell.
A highlight of the Mayfest after-hours scene will be NVA's Stormy
Waters clubnight, which is still cloaked in mystique.
Future hectic plans include the company returning to the David Mamet
play which won them early acclaim, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, to be
presented at the Tron Theatre in July, followed by a visit to the
Citizens' Theatre in July.
That production is as yet uncomfirmed and will not, as Arnold claimed,
be an Oscar Wilde play; that was just an excuse to allow him an
opportunity to demonstrate his very idiosyncratic one-man performance of
Lady Windemere's Fan. You had to be there.

SOMETIMES, you can't help but wonder: ''What would all those classic
ballet characters -- the princes, dying swans, and sylphs -- look like
if they were transposed into the here and now? Well, thanks to Matthew
Bourne and his Adventures in Motion Pictures company, we don't have to
look any further.
Bourne's stripped-down but choreographically rich Highland Fling
(launched at last year's Edinburgh Festival Ball) triumphantly lifts the
old Bournonville classic, La Sylphide, out of the past, gives it a good
shake around but never loses the exuberant dancability of the original.
Originally a work of ethereal enchantment and the elusiveness of love,
Bourne has given it a contemporary spin in a high-rise,
grafitti-riddled, carton-strewn Glasgow with James, the groom who gets
spirited away on his wedding night by a sloe-eyed sylph now a (rather
smart) unemployed welder high on speed and ecstasy.
Still a story of romantic fantasy but now drug induced, James's
seductive little sylph has become one of a collection of hollow-eyed,
black-rimmed punkish, mixed-gendered fairies who would certainly not
look out of place in a Derek Jarman movie.
With plenty of malevolence around, there's still a good deal that's
tongue-in-cheek with Jimmy Shand by the bucketful lapping around before
and during the interval.
Bourne's dancers -- Scott Ambler, Rosemary Allen, Isobel Mortimer,
Andrew George, Phil Hill and Emily Peircy -- are a treat, imparting
detail and characterisation in every gesture and grimace.
Quietly subversive, with a sense of camp just sufficient to heighten
the humour, Bourne's ''romantic wee ballet'' (the first of its kind in
this space) works wonderfully and augurs well for future dance
programmes.

<HEADLINE>Suicide is ruled out after inquiry into diver's death</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979173620</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A YOUNG widow has achieved her goal of seeing her diver husband's name
cleared of suicide smears.
Mrs Claire Locke, 24, was left to bring up two young children when her
husband, Stewart, drowned during a diving operation to recover a #20m
haul of smuggled drugs.
She tried for almost 18 months to find out why he died while picking
up packages of cannabis resin from the seabed off Scotstown Beach,
Aberdeenshire, on October 13, 1993.
Now a sheriff has found that the 24-year-old diver's death was an
accident and not suicide.
He also criticised the commercial diving firm which employed Mr Locke
for failing to apply proper safety standards, and Customs officials for
poor supervision.
The criticisms were made by Sheriff Frank Keane in his findings,
issued yesterday, after a six-day fatal accident inquiry at Peterhead
Sheriff Court earlier this month.
Mrs Locke, of Baird Road, Strichen, Aberdeenshire, said the 13-page
determination could not have been more favourable.
''I am absolutely delighted with the determination. It is more than we
had ever hoped for,'' she said.
''I just hope the Health and Safety Executive take the sheriff's
recommendations on board.
''Since Stewart's death, I have been determined to make inshore diving
a safe industry and to ensure that no other diver's wife has to go
through what I have been going through because of failings in the
system.''
During the inquiry there were strong suggestions that Mr Locke had
taken his own life.
But Sheriff Keane states: ''I have taken the view that the death was
not suicidal but accidental. A definite cause of the accident will never
be established.''
The most probable explanation for Mr Locke's death was that the diver
got into difficulties and was forced to cut his lifeline and ditch his
helmet, he adds.
But the surf and strong currents, combined with the weight of his
equipment, meant he could not move quickly enough to save himself.
Sheriff Keane lists a number of precautions which J. Allan Diving
Services should have taken to improve safety.
He said the diving team, which consisted of Mr Locke, Mr James Floyd
-- who doubled as supervisor and standby diver -- and an unqualified
tender, Mr John Thomson, was too small.
''The team should have had a supervisor, a diver and a stand-by diver.
It is debatable whether, in the conditions prevailing, there should not
also have been an extra diver,'' he states.
''If this question had been properly addressed, then the accident
might well have been avoided.''
Sheriff Keane recommended that a stringent system of qualified
inspectors should be established to ensure that firms comply with diving
regulations.
He also accused Customs and Excise of taking a hands-off approach to
both the commercial diving firm and police divers employed to recover
the drugs.
''There was some atmosphere between the two teams which might have
benefited from more defined liaison,'' he states.
Mrs Locke intends to sue J. Allan Diving Services and Customs and
Excise for damages in an action at the Court of Session.
One of the key witnesses to the inquiry, diver Alex Thomson, turned up
at the court limping and bruised, apparently having been beaten up the
day after giving evidence.
A lawyer for Mr Thomson told the inquiry that his client had been set
upon outside his house the night before.
A Peterhead man has since been charged with breach of the peace in
connection with the alleged incident.
Mr Gordon McGregor, solicitor for the now defunct diving company, said
his clients were satisfied with the findings.
''The three main points which the sheriff makes regarding manpower,
the emergency procedure, and the diving conditions were all matters
which should have been considered by an experienced diver before he went
into the water.
''We are satisfied that, as far as the company is concerned, there was
nothing more that could have been done to make the dive any safer.''

Gavin Bell reports how a marriage which survived everything apartheid
South Africa could through at it over almost three decades, ended on the
eve of Nelson Mandela's triumph -- and now there is further ignominy to
endure
FROM his prison cell on Robben Island, Nelson Mandela wrote a
passionate letter to his wife in 1983. He was then 65 years old, and had
been behind bars for two decades, but his love for her was undiminished.
''At my age I would have expected all the urges of youth to have faded
away,'' he wrote. ''But it does not appear to be so. The mere sight of
you, even the thought of you, kindles a thousand fires in me.''
Six years later, while Mandela was still languishing in prison, a
different message appeared on the mud-brick walls of Soweto, the
sprawling black township near Johannesburg. It read: ''Free Nelson. Hang
Winnie.''
The graffiti signalled a rising tide of anger and resentment against
Mrs Mandela, who was accused by her own people of acting in a
high-handed and often violent manner against anyone who challenged her
authority. It was sparked in particular by the murder of Stompie
Moeketsi, a 14-year-old boy who had incurred her wrath, by thugs in her
entourage.
Shortly after Stompie's body was discovered, anti-apartheid leaders
publicly accused Mrs Mandela of complicity in the killing, and her
bodyguards of conducting a reign of terror in the township. Under the
banner of the United Democratic Front, the principal surrogate of the
then banned African National Congress, they charged her with violating
the human rights she once fought to uphold, and declared her a political
and social outcast. The woman revered by black South Africans as the
''Mother of the Nation'' became reviled as the ''Mugger of the Nation''.
Yet when her husband was finally released in February, 1990, he walked
to freedom arm-in-arm with Winnie, presenting to the world an enduring
image of a loving couple reunited after a lifetime of persecution by
successive apartheid regimes.
When she was indicted on eight charges of kidnap and assault in the
Stompie case a year later, Mandela stood by her. Soon after her trial
began, he told a news conference: ''We have no hesitation in asserting
her innocence.''
Even when she was found guilty of abducting the youth, Mandela was
there to comfort her. When her six-year prison sentence was reduced to a
#3000 fine -- by an appeal court ruling that owed more to political
expediency than criminal justice -- Mandela expressed his relief and
welcomed her back into the ANC fold.
But by then there was no curbing his wife's erratic behaviour and
naked ambitions for power, and within a few months their marriage was
effectively over. They separated in 1992 when it became apparent that
Mandela could no longer control his tempestuous wife, or afford to be
intimately associated with her as he prepared to become President of
post-apartheid South Africa.
Even then, Mandela was magnanimous. ''I part from my wife with no
recriminations,'' he said. ''I embrace her with all the love and
affection I have nursed for her inside and outside prison from the
moment I first met her.'' This from a man who knew his wife had been
having an affair with a lawyer almost 30 years her junior, and that both
were implicated in the disappearance of ANC welfare funds.
Given Winnie's fiery temperament and lust for power, it was only a
matter of time before political separation followed. Her expulsion from
her husband's government of national unity yesterday was as much to do
with her fractious brawling with other ANC leaders as with her alleged
involvement in another corruption scandal.
When Winnie perceives herself to be under attack, her instinct is to
fight back tooth and claw. After being forced to resign as head of the
ANC department of social welfare in 1992, she lashed out at a ''cabal''
in the organisation and vowed to mobilise her supporters in the
townships to ''clean up the house''.
More recently, she claimed she was the victim of a vendetta by
charlatans and cowards. ''The fight against those who are perceived to
be pillars of ANC mass support (herself) has now become obvious and
transparent,'' she declared. ''In defence of the aspirations of my
people, I am left with no choice but to take the challenge head on.''
In reality, she left her husband with no choice but to dismiss her;
for the truth is that Winnie Mandela is a violent, dangerous woman
capable of inciting revolt among militant township youths and illiterate
peasants. In full cry above a sea of upturned faces she is an awesome
sight; her fist raised in defiance, her bosom heaving with indignation,
her voice shrill with anger as she rails and spits venom at her
perceived enemies. She has assumed the role of a black Eva Peron,
aspiring to rule the most powerful country in Africa on her husband's
death. This is the rabble-rouser who had to be banished from ANC
corridors of power, more than the kidnapper of children and the petty
thief.
It is an ignominious end to a romance that began with all the passion
and heroism of a Greek tragedy. Mandela was a 39-year-old civil rights
lawyer and ANC activist, separated from his first wife, when he met and
fell in love with the 23-year-old social worker at Soweto's Baragwanath
Hospital in 1957. He was a handsome tribal prince waging a crusade
against racist oppressors; she was a fiery beauty from his native
Transkei, inspired by his noble ideals.
They married a year later, although they knew they were doomed to a
life of separation and persecution. They had barely a year together as
man and wife, before clandestine warfare and 27 years of imprisonment
tore them apart.
For three decades, Winnie displayed outstanding courage and commitment
to the anti-apartheid movement. Repeatedly banned, banished, and
imprisoned, she endured her ordeal in the absence of her husband with
commendable fortitude. There is no question that her love helped Mandela
to survive the hell of Robben Island. But the wives of other jailed ANC
leaders, notably Albertina Sisulu, emerged from similar nightmares with
their dignity and integrity intact. It is now apparent that Winnie
Mandela did not.
The cruel irony is that the marriage that survived the worst ravages
of apartheid has been destroyed by Winnie's own aberrant behaviour.
Their younger daughter, Zindzi, says the break-up has left her father
lonely, and her mother bitter. Announcing their separation three years
ago, Mandela told his audience: ''Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you
appreciate the pain I have gone through.'' Nobody who was present could
have doubted his sincerity, or his enduring love for his wife.
Arguably the most tragic aspect of the end of the affair is that
Nelson Mandela has been condemned to die with a broken heart.

Andrew Wilson reports on the brewers who, in the past decade, have
seen everything they touch turn to liquid gold
IT SEEMS to be the lucky brewer, and certainly the most adventurous. A
decade ago it was going nowhere and vulnerable to a takeover bid which
did turn up in 1989. But now, Scottish &amp; Newcastle is poised to make its
third major acquisition in five years through the probable purchase of
parts of Courage for perhaps #400m. If completed, the Edinburgh-based
company would become the largest brewer in the UK, boosting its share
from 12% to possibly around 25% and some 2% ahead of Bass, traditionally
the industry leader.
Courage has a 19% share of output but it is most unlikely that S&amp;N
would be allowed to buy the whole company. It is almost certain that
talks have already taken place with the Office of Fair Trading which is
currently investigating the brewers' policy of selling beer at different
prices to tenants and the free trade.
One side-effect would be that the Scottish contribution to group
profits would be even further reduced from the present 20% by a very
substantial margin.
Even a partial purchase would represent yet another coup for chairman
Sir Alick Rankin and chief executive Brian Stewart as confirmation that
their strategy of expansion is being proved correct.
So far, they have had the priceless assets of flawless timing -- some
call it luck. But no matter which, it is the end result that counts for
a company that has been shrewder than most in recent years in choosing
some of its top people.
Old Etonian Sir Alick, 60, has been with the brewer since 1960. He was
chief executive for eight years until 1992 when he moved up to being
chairman as the then Sir David Nickson retired.
Apparently stiff and a little stand-offish and with a short fuse that
occasionally is set alight, Sir Alick is a man of determined views while
being very good company.
He has worked his way up from a very lowly position in S&amp;N from
Waverley Vintners.
Earlier this year, he surprised his S&amp;N colleagues when he announced
that he will give up his #300,000-a-year chairmanship in 1997 as well as
that of distribution and hire group Christian Salvesen (#85,000) to
become chairman of Perth-based insurers General Accident.
''One way and another it is long overdue. Scottish &amp; Newcastle has had
me around for a long time.''
However, his strategy throughout the 1990s has been to increase the
company's share of the UK beer market to about 20% and the Courage deal,
even if only in part complete, would mean that he has achieved his goal.
Mr Stewart, 49, smiles easily, is highly approachable and has a very
high reputation in the City. He started life also well down in the
organisation and must, personally, be somewhat surprised at his present
eminence. The path was probably opened when finance director Chris
Chalmers tragically died at an early age, but he has slipped into the
chief executive's role very easily.
For at least 30 years there have been suggestions that Courage and S&amp;N
should get together as they have always been an ideal geographical fit.
The logic of a merger was based on both being vulnerable to takeover
bids -- Courage eventually succumbed to Imperial Tobacco which in turn
became part of Hanson before being sold on to Elders IXL of Australia,
the then parent company of Foster's.
A full merger would bring together brands such as McEwans, Younger's,
Newcastle Brown and Theakston as fully-owned beers while licence
products include the highly successful Beck's and Coors on one side
while Foster's, which could be bought outright as a brand for the UK and
European markets, is being supplemented by Courage's Directors and Best
Bitters as well as John Smith's.
There is a threat to jobs in that the enlarged group would have some
10 breweries including Holyrood, Newcastle and Manchester as the S&amp;N
large-volume producers, while Courage's main production comes from
Reading and the Smith's brewery in Yorkshire. Casualties could include
S&amp;N Home Brewery in Nottingham and the Courage-owned Webster's in
Halifax.
The takeover goes against the industry trend. Over recent years, other
brewers have reduced their dependency on beer.
The former Allied-Lyons, whose Scottish brewing operations are based
at Alloa, acquired the Domecq brandy and sherry company of Spain last
year to form Allied Domecq. It had already put its brewing capacity into
a company jointly owned with Carlsberg of Denmark to form Carlsberg
Tetley with a 17% overall market share. Bass bought Holiday Inns to
become the world's biggest hotelier while Grand Metropolitan has quit
brewing completely with the one-time Watney Mann subsidiary now part of
Courage. Even Whitbread, with a 14% market share, is going much more
down the food route with its #85m investment in expanding its highly
profitable Brewers Fayre chain to 300 units.
Food is seen by the City as a decided strength at Whitbread and a
weakness at S&amp;N, although S&amp;N pubs are the most popular ''for meeting
people''.
However, S&amp;N has so far proved highly astute in its big deals. That is
of necessity as expansion has been the prime strategy ever since it
escaped from Elder of Australia, which owns the Foster's lager brand, by
the skin of its teeth thanks to the intervention of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission which blocked the #1600m acrimonious takeover bid in
1989.
First it sold the Thistle Hotels chain for #645m to Mount Charlotte at
the very top of the market despite a storm of protest in Scotland and
attacks on Rankin's patriotism. The money was largely reinvested in the
Center Parcs Dutch holiday village operator which has since turned into
a veritable gold mine -- much to the chagrin of Euro-Disney. For reasons
of tact, S&amp;N does not disabuse those in Europe who still believe the
subsidiary to be Dutch rather than British-owned. It has altogether 14
villages, of which three are in England.
When the initial stake was taken it seemed high risk, as previous S&amp;N
expansions into Europe ended in tears. But so far Center Parcs has been
a highly profitable venture, making about #80m this year.
In 1994, S&amp;N acquired the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain from Grand
Metropolitan for #703m. That brought in more than 900 pubs with a bigger
emphasis on food than the traditional S&amp;N outlet and, critically, a much
greater exposure to the South of England. It is early days still but the
first indications are positive and there could be even more significant
beer supply savings to come in due course from Courage.

THE Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr is to close after councillors ruled it
cannot operate outwith regular licensing hours.
Kyle and Carrick licensing board decided yesterday that it would not
renew the club's extension to 2am. Three young men had been attending
the club last year when they took the drug ecstasy and later died.
Now management of the Pavilion, in which Hanger 13 operates late on
Saturday nights, is considering whether to continue its appeal against a
suspension of the entire licence, imposed last November. The club has
been operating pending that appeal which is due to be heard on April 21.
Councillors heard an objection from Strathclyde police yesterday along
similar lines to the one which led to the suspension -- that the
continued operation of the club could constitute a threat to public
order or safety.
After consideration, they voted by seven votes to two that the
extension should be withdrawn and the club made to close at 11pm.
The management could apply again to the next sitting of the board
should an appeal to the sheriff be successful.
In May of last year, Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, and Mr
Andrew Dick, 19, from Glasgow, died from the effects of taking ecstasy
at a ''rave'' event in the club. Then in August, Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20,
from Rigside, died in similar circumstances.
Following a fatal accident inquiry last month, Sheriff Neil Gow, QC,
warned of the effects of the so-called ''leisure drug'' ecstasy, saying:
''A dance with ecstasy can lead to a dance with death.''
While he laid no particular blame at the door of the club's
management, the sheriff called for a strong, Government lead on battling
drug abuse.
Club operator Mrs Christine Ridha said after yesterday's meeting: ''I
am shocked and deeply disappointed at this decision which seems to
ignore the findings of Sheriff Gow at the inquiry into the deaths.
''The club is closed with immediate effect as we cannot operate any of
our late functions without the extension. Not only will Hanger 13 end
but so will our popular rock and sixties nights.
''A lot of people are going to have their enjoyment ruined by this
decision which I believe is the wrong one in all the circumstances.
''We will have to consider the future very carefully and decide if we
shut the doors and walk away or try to keep going with other functions
until the suspension is over.''
The Pavilion will continue to operate tea dances on Thursday and
Friday afternoons for the time being.
Mrs Ridha added: ''The sheriff laid no blame with us and with recent
changes to the operation of the club I believe we have the safest and
most responsible venue of its kind in the country. The young people who
enjoy these dance events will go elsewhere and there is no guarantee
they will find such a safe and responsibly run venue.''
Her disappointment was shared by Ayr MP Phil Gallie who said the
decision ''flies in the face of common sense''. He added: ''The police
and the board both seem to have ignored the views of the sheriff and
continued on the basis of evidence and reaction which was around a year
ago.
''I still believe that a well-run club like Hanger 13 poses less of a
threat than some of the pubs and clubs in the town.''
Mr Jack Drummond, the uncle of the late Andrew Stoddart, who
represented the deceased's family at the FAI, said: ''I would warmly
welcome this decision as we have felt all along that the club was not
run as well as it could have been and that this could have had a bearing
on these tragic deaths.
''We have never taken issue with the fact that Andrew took drugs but I
was not alone in being shocked by the level of drug taking both inside
and outside the club. Perhaps now the families can put this behind them
and we all hope and pray that no other family will have to go through
what they went through.''
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said:
''This cross-party decision to withdraw the extension was made on the
recommendation of the police and should act as a warning to the
operators of all nightclubs.
''There is a place for these venues when properly organised which can
provide a safe and enjoyable evening for youngsters but any lessening of
standards can create the climate in which drug dealing and other dangers
flourish.''
* A youth who slashed a man with a machete after a night out at Hanger
13 was yesterday sentenced at Ayr Sheriff Court to carry out 240 hours'
community service.
Sheriff Neil Gow warned labourer Dale ''Jnr'' Dolan, 22, of Castlemilk
Drive, Glasgow: ''It is essential that you refrain from taking drugs in
future''
The court was told last year that Dolan attacked a man on a bus bound
for Paisley after a rave at the club. The victim required 20 stitches in
the back and five on his left arm.
Defence solicitor Joe Beltrami said it was a retaliatory action after
his client had been beaten up outside Hanger 13 a week before by five
people ''deranged'' on drugs.
Sheriff Gow said that as Dolan was a first offender and had a good
family background he would be lenient and not sentence him to jail.

Ruth Wishart examines why Government Ministers are blaming
interviewers for the hard time they receive on the nation's news
programmes
WELL, I for one am grateful for the timely intervention of Treasury
Minister Jonathan Aitken, without whom we might never have suspected
just what a vulnerable, sensitive, thin-skinned chap is the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Mr Aitken, thank heavens given his day job, seems to
have a consummate grasp of the smaller statistical detail, having been
able to inform us that John Humphrys of the Today programme interrupted
Kenneth Clarke no fewer than 32 times in the course of one interview.
Proof positive, supposes our Jonathan, that the BBC is a thinly veiled
cover operation for the campaign to elect a Labour Government.
Back in the real world, radio and television interviewers checked
their watches and noted that, sure enough, it was that time of the
electoral cycle again. The moment when a Government supposes that an
upcoming poll -- in this case two sets of local elections and a
by-election -- might produce results suggesting that the public was
moved to less-than-instinctive support of their current policies.
And one of the time-honoured tactics in dealing with this unpalatable
supposition is to have a go at shooting the messengers. The truth, as
sometime-journalists like Mr Aitken know very well, is that the people
who routinely try to manage the news and put a sympathetic spin on
interviews, are the politicians themselves.
Very few interviewers set out to be confrontational. A studio barney
might make a good listen in the short term, but it hardly adds to the
sum of human wisdom on the subject to hand. Neither does it help
maintain the relationship of mutual respect with the interviewee which
is an essential tool of the trade. Interviews which become hostile
encounters invariably do so because the politician sets out deliberately
to evade the issues. If you have asked a straight question four times in
a row and been fobbed off with warmed-over party platitudes then an
interruption is part of your professional duty to the listener or
viewer.
The BBC guidelines on interviewing make this perfectly clear. They ask
the interviewers to ''ask questions which an intelligent and
independent-minded member of the audience would want answers to.
Persistence is also called for, harassment is not. Deference is not
wanted, courtesy is''. Unfortunately deference is exactly what's wanted
by many politicians whose ministerial status has given them ideas above
their station. They no longer view themselves as public servants, but as
national icons.
Curiously, this is not a charge one would level at Mr Clarke, whose
natural humour prevents the pomposity which seems to have become endemic
among some of his colleagues on both front and Opposition benches. Some
of Mr Clarke's fellow Cabinet Ministers now consider themselves rather
too grand to take part in any kind of studio debate with their opposite
number, which is why you so often see these lopside items on programmes
like Newsnight and Channel 4 News. Instead of the cut and thrust of
genuine political debate, the presenter has to settle for a pre-recorded
interview with an Opposition spokesperson followed by a ministerial
response.
This has two benefits for the interviewee. First, they are not
subjected to questioning by the one person in the country as conversant
with the policy detail as themselves, and, secondly, they get the last
word.
Is that fair, democratic broadcasting.
In addition to all of which, senior politicians appearing on current
affairs or documentary programmes are routinely briefed by the
broadcasters so that they can be conversant with any issues likely to be
raised. As a matter of course and courtesy the producer will always
provide senior spokespeople with an outline of the territory to be
covered and advance knowledge of any film or taped material which will
precede the interview.
Similarly, Ministers appearing on programmes like Question Time are
extensively briefed by their departments on all the issues likely to be
flagged up by that night's audience. But you don't hear the poor bloody
infantry -- the non-professionals on the programme -- whine, that's not
fair, Norman got more help than I did.
There are, of course, bad journalists and bad interviewers. As soon as
a broadcaster starts to believe that what he or she thinks matters more
than the opinions of those they are interviewing then the need for
incisive questioning may be submerged in the cult of personality.
But there are few top-flight interviewers of whom that could be said;
certainly not Messrs Humphrys and Naughtie and their Today team mates.
But they are skilled enough and sharp enough to know that their desire
to give the public accurate information will often be in conflict with
the politicians' natural instinct to fudge, propagandise, evade,
dissemble, bluster and flog the party line.
And talking of bluster, step forward Mr Aitken, Mr Redwood, and the
Lord Tebbit, three of the people who have chosen to make the highest
profile attack on the BBC. They're not trying to improve standards --
they're trying to scare the Beeb's troops into slavish submission.

Brussels, Monday
BURUNDI'S president said today he feared genocide had started in the
ethnically explosive central African country.
At least 150 people were killed in a rampage by militiamen of the
Tutsi minority on Friday night in Bujumbura and 50,000 were fleeing the
worst ethnic violence in Burundi in 18 months. Some reports based on
witnesses put the death toll at 500, mainly Hutus.
''I really see a genocide, because those things were well prepared and
carried out fairly systematically. I don't believe . . . in self
defence,'' President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, told Belgian VTM
television.
''The targets were Hutus, and the authors were clearly an ethnic
group, I say it was deliberately started for a genocide,'' he told BRTN
television.
He said police had been unable to stop the killings by ''groups of
youngsters, militiamen, clearly Tutsis'' -- perhaps, he said, because
they did not want to.--Reuter

Manila, Monday
ISLAMIC militants planned to crash-dive a plane packed with explosives
into the headquarters of the US Central Intelligence Agency to show
Muslims were ready to die for the glory of Islam, according to documents
seized by the Philippine police.
The group also planned simultaneously to blow up two US United
Airlines 747 jets in January as they approached Hong Kong and considered
attacking the American and Israeli embassies in Manila with bombs
dropped from a plane, according to a police report obtained today.
The documents, including computer printouts, were seized on January 6
in the Manila hideout of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, alleged mastermind of the
1993 World Trade Centre bombing in New York, it said.
Yousef was arrested in Pakistan last month and extradited to the
United States to face trial for the New York bombing which killed six
people and injured 1000.
The CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was ''a future bombing
target'', the report said.
The CIA attack was to be carried out by Yousef's associate, Saeed
Akhman, using an aircraft loaded with powerful explosives, one of the
captured documents showed.
The report by Manila police superintendent Samuel Pagdilao Jr linked
Yousef to the December 11 bombing of a Japan-bound Philippine Airlines
(PAL) plane, which killed a Japanese passenger and injured 10 others.
Yousef, travelling under an assumed Italian name, planted the bomb
inside a life jacket under a passenger's seat on the plane on an earlier
leg of its flight, it said. The blast forced the aircraft to make an
emergency landing in Okinawa.

LEADERS of 20,000 ambulance workers, who five years ago waged a bitter
six-month pay battle, yesterday joined almost one million other NHS
workers in rejecting the Government's 1% national wage offer which looks
set to spark an even bigger confrontation.
They were the last significant group to be offered the 1% centrally
plus the possibility of negotiating more locally and, like the 600,0000
nurses and midwives, administrative and clerical staff, and ancillary
workers, they threw it out as ''derisory''.
Ms Maggie Dunn, Unison senior national officer and secretary of the
ambulance union negotiating team, said that ambulance staff would be
infuriated by the insulting offer which would barely buy a qualified
ambulance worker a cup of tea a day. One per cent, when inflation was
running at 3.4%, was a pay cut and reflected the low value the
Government placed on their health care skills .
Ambulance staff would be throwing themselves behind demonstrations
planned for Thursday.
Scotland's 3000 ambulance personnel will have to decide whether to
stick with the central negotiations or accept a management package
offered them last week to coax them away from central bargaining. It
will be some weeks before this confused picture becomes clearer.
Almost all NHS unions are now moving towards industrial action ballots
although they are unlikely to be activated before the end of April and
in the meantime they are uniting in a campaign to maximise public
support for their claim for 3% paid nationally.

Moscow, Monday
Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, who returned to earth last week
after a record 438 days in space, said today his odyssey had proved
mankind could fly to Mars.
''Our flight and my first steps after landing have proved that we were
able to work there on the station, despite spending so much time in
space,'' Polyakov, who is still in quarantine, told reporters from
behind a transparent plastic shield.
''It has proved that after hitting Mars, we could carry out some
research work and walk,'' he said.
Polyakov and his fellow cosmonauts Yelena Kondakova and Alexander
Viktorenko, who each spent 169 days aboard the Mir space station, are
undergoing medical check-ups in the Star City space centre outside
Moscow.
The 52-year-old cosmonaut said he walked several steps soon after the
space module landed last Wednesday in a snow-swept desert in Kazakhstan.
''I continued the experiment just after landing. Of course, doctors
wouldn't let me walk a lot, but I made a few steps.''
Polyakov, a doctor, studied the effects of long-term weightlessness on
the human body, using himself as a guinea pig. The data he has brought
back will help scientists assess if humans could live permanently in
space or fly to Mars and back.
''Every one of us goes there for that (to test the effects),
especially doctors. And now I must give myself entirely over to the
specialists, who now have a chance to learn about living in space for
long periods of time,'' Polyakov said.
''I hope those who will fly to Mars in the 30s of the next century
will remember with gratitude what we have done. And we will now try to
give our experience to them.''
European Space Agency and NASA scientists say long-term weightlessness
causes calcium loss in bones, which become brittle, while the spine gets
longer. Legs shorten and muscles begin to waste through lack of use.
By the end of a 30-minute news conference Polyakov said he was feeling
tired.
Polyakov is one of only five people who have spent more than 300 days
in space. In his orbits in Mir he travelled some 250 million miles --
more than the equivalent of a return trip to the sun or seven times the
distance to Mars.--Reuter

Pretoria, Monday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela today personally sacked his
firebrand wife, Winnie, from the Government she has publicly taken to
criticising.
In an eight-line letter delivered to her office he said: ''Dear Mrs
Mandela, I have decided to terminate your appointment as Deputy Minister
of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology with immediate effect.
''Thank you for the services you have rendered to the Government so
far.''
The dramatic move ended weeks of speculation and was announced by the
president at a news conference.
He said: ''I have taken this decision after much reflection, given
that comrade Winnie Mandela has in the past played an important role in
the struggle against apartheid.''
He would not give any reasons for her dismissal, but said his first
responsibility was to ensure the efficient working of his Government of
national unity, which has the job of leading South Africa from white
rule to full democracy.
Mrs Mandela has been under renewed fire since last month when she
snubbed a Government order to stay at home and instead went on a trip to
West Africa.
While she was away police raided her home and offices in connection
with an investigation into allegations of fraud and misuse of public
office.
President Mandela, 76, and his wife, 61, separated in 1992 after she
was convicted of kidnapping and assaulting black children during the
anti-apartheid struggle. A six-year prison sentence was reduced on
appeal to a fine and a suspended jail term.
Mr Mandela recently forced his wife to apologise in writing for
criticising the Government and accusing him of pandering to white
interests.
Mrs Mandela's sacking was immediately welcomed by the white-led
National Party of former president F W de Klerk and by the liberal
Democratic Party.
''The Government of national unity cannot be held hostage by the
arrogance, threats, and indiscipline of Government members,'' NP
spokesman David Malatsi said.
Mrs Mandela's private secretary, Mr Allan Reynolds, said he broke the
news to his boss after opening the president's letter when it was
delivered by hand.
''I think it would have been more courteous if he had told her face to
face,'' Mr Reynolds added.
Mrs Mandela's job has gone to ANC stalwart Brigitte Mabandla. Mrs
Mandela will finally lose her staff, and salary, at the end of next
month.
Her sacking is the latest plunge in a political career that has taken
a roller-coaster ride from acclaim to disgrace and back again.
During the worst of the anti-apartheid struggle in the 1970s and 80s
she was the ''Mother of the Nation''. Cynics then dubbed her the
''Mugger of the Nation'' after she was convicted in 1992 of kidnapping
four youths in Soweto township, where she lives.
Mrs Mandela, who has described herself as a naive country girl, was
catapulted into the world of liberation politics when she married Nelson
Mandela in 1958.
He was arrested soon after their marriage and in 1964 he was jailed
for 27 years.
Mrs Mandela became a leading ANC figure in her own right, enduring
police harassment and banishment to the remote town of Brandfort in Free
State province in the 1970s.
President Mandela -- who once said his wife had suffered from a lack
of guidance during his years in jail -- announced their separation in
1992 after reports of an affair between Mrs Mandela and a younger man,
and the first public claims of mismanagement of funds under her control.
She resigned all her posts in the ANC, but in December 1993 she
bounced back, winning election as president of the ANC Women's League
and then a seat in parliament.
Since then a series of scandals or potential scandals have plagued
her.
During the Queen's visit Mrs Mandela was barred from all events. She
responded in typical fashion at the weekend, criticising the Government
for spending #540,000 on the royal visit while black South Africans went
hungry.

JOHN Humphrys wasn't in it as the National Heritage Department
Ministers were bombarded with aggressively probing, indeed personal,
questions. ''When did the Minister last borrow a book from a public
library and what was its title?'' demanded Mr Geoff Hoon (Ashfield --
Lab.). How intimate can you get? It would justify a chap storming out of
the studio or, in this case, the Chamber.
Of course, if Ministers always had as good answers as Mr Iain Sproat,
they would complain less about tough questioning. ''Last Friday, and it
was called 'Nelson' by Roy Hattersley,'' he responded crisply. Apart
from putting a small sum of Public Lending Right money in the way of the
former deputy leader of the Labour Party, the answer could not be
faulted.
Indeed, despite a somewhat manacing look and a habit of advancing to
the despatch box as if preparing to collapse on top of it, Mr Sproat is
one of the best Question Time performers, producing pithy and well
balanced replies.
Even when Mr Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne -- Con.) had fulminated about
East Sussex Council squandering library funds on ''gay and lesbian
literature,'' he got away with replying: ''I would be grateful if you
would send me further details,'' with hardly a giggle in the House.
Mr Mark Fisher, an Opposition Arts spokesman, who, as one of Labour's
two Old Etonians, lives in a more rarified world than the rest of us,
appeared puzzled when some chortles greeted his complaint that, thanks
to Government cuts, Somerset had been unable to buy any ''adult
fiction'' this year, a genre which one had not previously imagined
thrived especially in that delightful county.
Labour charged that the Government was destroying the public library
service. Mr Sproat hit back that more books are borrowed now than ever
before; nine-and-a-half per head of the population per year he said --
the half could well be Mr Hattersley's 'Nelson,' which is a very slim
volume.
Having defended the library front, Mr Sproat was assailed over sport
for which this versatile department is also responsible. How much longer
would we have to wait for the promised White Paper on Sport? ''It will
certainly be out before England beat West Indies in a Test match,'' the
wily Sproat replied.
One then felt that the amiable Mr Tom Pendry, Labour spokesman on
sport, made a miscalculation. He declared
that most youngsters didn't want to play all this competitive sport
the Government was seeking to foist on them.
A little while ago, this would have seemed a safe enough sentiment
from a politically correct point of view. Competition reeks of the
market, the market reeks of unbridled greed. Forcing the kids into
football, rugby, cricket and hockey teams is clearly a long step towards
creating a world even fitter for public utility chairmen to live in.
But that was yesterday and one could not help feeling, that having
moved Labour in the right direction, so to speak, on nationalisation,
defence, education, and law and order, Mr Blair might take time out soon
to dwell on the virtues of team games implying that Labour will keep
them but that a nicer sort of player will emerge.
Mr Sproat said nobody wanted to stop pupils taking part in individual
sports but as there had been a falling away in team games that was what
they were emphasising.
He was then tackled from behind by Mr Richard Tracey (Surbiton --
Con.), who repeated Mr Pendry's point that youngsters just didn't want
to play team games these days.
There are not the only ones, as we were reminded by Mr Andrew
Mackinlay (Thurrock -- Lab.), who asked after the welfare of the new
Cabinet committee on banana skins. Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, who has the unenviable task of presiding over it,
got on his constitutional high horse but, translated, the committee's
function is to remind Government and party that they are in a team sport
of an extremely competitive nature and that unless they lift their game,
relegation threatens to leave them sick as a parrot.

A REPORT to go before the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
in May has criticised the social security system for not adequately
providing for retired missionaries.
The Board of World Mission says that in the past it remunerated its
staff at a rate which enabled them to enjoy modest comforts but not to
save for the future, and the level of pension provided assumed that
missionaries who returned home to retire could live on the state
provision.
However, it reported: ''Nowadays, it seems, the state is no longer
willing to provide free comprehensive care on their return, since it is
unwilling to provide adequate resources even for ordinary citizens.
''Those who are young and strong are not expected to offer themselves
to work overseas on low wages, but to refund the costs of their
education and make provision for the times when they will be ill, not
working, or retired.''
The Rev Dr Chris Wigglesworth, general secretary of World Mission,
said yesterday: ''Social security makes it very difficult for people to
rely on state provision in the way we could in the past.''
He said that for the past five years the board had provided retired
missionaries with a ''home grant'' assessed on years of service abroad
in addition to their Church pension.
The board says the cost of maintaining staff overseas is increasing
year by year. It adds that if people chose to join the staff it would
seem fairer they receive much higher salaries than the board has
traditionally provided.
However, higher allowances could separate the missionaries even
further from the people among whom they live and work. The tensions are
already almost unbearable because of the economic distress which
devaluation, compounded by drought, has brought to so many.
The board says that, despite rapid social changes in Scotland and
abroad, it still believes it is important to send staff to work
overseas.

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams meets Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
today, still awaiting the go-ahead for talks between his party and
British Ministers.
Mr Adams said last night that he ''simply does not know'' when Sinn
Fein's dialogue with Ministers will get under way.''There are no
obstacles on our side, and the meetings could have already taken
place,'' he said.
However, senior Sinn Fein strategist Martin McGuinness yesterday
expressed hope that his party would meet a Minister for talks on
Northern Ireland before the end of this week.
He told BBC TV: ''I would be hopeful that it can take place possibly
on Thursday or Friday, but at the end of the day, that is a matter for
the British Government.''
0 Mr Adams said Sinn Fein was prepared to talk about anything,
including the decommissioning of illegal arms, separately from the
broader issue of ''demilitarisation'' in Northern Ireland.
The party is understood to have made that potentially significant
point clear in a letter to the Government.
Wrangling between the two sides last week centred on the terminology
of the agenda for their anticipated discussions, with Whitehall pressing
for movement on the decommissioning of weapons and Sinn Fein
concentrating on the need for all-round demilitarisation.
Mr Adams said: ''I want to see all arms taken permanently out of
commission. There are unlicensed weapons, there are also those in the
hands of the British Army and the RUC.''

THE White Paper on sport due to be published this summer should
include safeguards to protect the #250m a year Scottish local
authorities pay towards sport in Scotland, the Scottish Sports Council
said yesterday.
As Labour set out its expectations of what should be in the
long-awaited White Paper, a spokesman for the SSC said local government
reorganisation has raised concerns that the funding might not be
safeguarded.
Sports Minister Iain Sproat said yesterday that the White Paper,
announced last week, will be published in early summer. He emphasised
that it would focus on sports provision in schools and in particular the
encouragement of competitve sports as a means of fostering discipline
and good sportsmanship.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith warned that Government policy
risks encouraging ''sports for the few'' instead of ''sports for all''
by ordering the new UK Sports Council, which comes into being next year,
to withdraw from the promotion of mass participation and informal
recreation.
The bulk of sports funding in Scotland -- about #250m a year -- comes
from local authorities. An SSC spokesman said: ''There may be concern on
how this will shake out with the unitary authorities.It's important that
the provision continues because it effects the health of the nation.''

A YOUNG Scots doctor has collapsed and died while on a skiing holiday
in the French Alps.
Mr Calum Guthrie, who was just 29, died of a brain haemorrhage similar
to that which killed former Scotland and Rangers football player Davie
Cooper last week.
Mr Guthrie, a trainee surgeon who played rugby as a centre for
Edinburgh side Trinity Academicals, was on holiday with friends.
A single man, he had worked for several years in the orthopaedics
department at Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie.
He was due to take up a new post shortly at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
Originally from Perth, Mr Guthrie was in the process of selling his home
in Glasgow to move to the capital.
A Monklands spokeswoman said: ''Everyone who worked with him is
absolutely shattered at the news. Calum was very popular and was widely
regarded as an outstanding trainee surgeon.
''Details are pretty sketchy just now but it seems that Calum died
from an antiarachnoid stroke.''
A Trinity Accies spokesman said: ''We were due to meet up with Calum
on Saturday before the match against Hillhead-Jordanhill in Glasgow.
''When he failed to turn up, one of the other players phoned to
contact him -- only to be told what had happened.
''Calum was a tremendous player and a super guy -- both on and off the
pitch.
''He was due to be playing this week in our annual Oldies against
Youngies match.
''Everyone at the club is devastated.''
Mr Guthrie's parents, Mr Peter Guthrie and his wife Ann, also have two
daughters and live in Auchterarder, Perthshire. They are in France
preparing to bring his body home.
No funeral arrangements have yet been made.

MINISTERS and their business managers agreed yesterday that the
defence of their party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, and their attack on
broadcasters' ''partisan'' interviewing should see them through the
crisis of identity in the run-up to local elections.
The Prime Minister, otherwise engaged, was not present at the tactical
meeting at No. 12 Downing Street yesterday and he was careful not to
have a meeting with Mr Hanley, who was being sniped at by Tory back
benchers as someone who was disaster-prone and had to be replaced.
The media has taken up this mood -- making it more difficult for Mr
Major to sack Mr Hanley, even if he wanted to.
The defence was conducted throughout the day by various Government
Ministers, led by Environment Secretary John Gummer -- a former party
chairman -- who said that he expected Mr Hanley to lead Central Office
at the next General Election.
This was reinforced by another ex-party chairman Sir Norman Fowler who
said: ''Jeremy Hanley is not remotely the problem as far as the Tory
Party is concerned.
''The problem of the Tory Party is some of the people who appear to be
conspiring to do us the utmost damage.''
Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken and Heritage Secretary
Stephen Dorrell later weighed in with support for the party chairman and
criticism of the BBC -- in particular over its interviewing techniques,
which, they claimed, already had been made by the BBC director general
John Birt himself.
The mocking of Mr Hanley continues on all sides, principally by the
Labour Party.
Deputy leader John Prescott said he was planning a campaign to save
him from the sack: ''Mr Hanley -- well, I must say as someone who has
been responsible for getting rid of incompetent Secretaries of State in
the past, I'm now launching 'Save Jeremy Hanley'.
''He is the Minister of Gaffes, he is incompetent but, quite frankly,
so is the Government and I hope he will stay in that job. ''
On the Tory side, the criticism of the party chairman matches that of
the complaints about the Prime Minister himself.
However, last night's mood at Westminster was that the more that the
media calls for their replacement, the more likely it is that both Mr
Major and Mr Hanley will remain in place for the General Election when
it comes.
Mr Aitken has led a concentrated onslaught on what Ministers believe
to be partisan in terviewing by the BBC on the key radio programmes
Today and The World at One, and the Newsnight television programme.
The Treasury Chief Secretary said yesterday on BBC Radio 4:: ''The
first person to make this criticism was the director general of the BBC
John Birt who criticised his own interviewers, without actually naming
them, for being overbearing and sneering.
''I think there is a feeling around that some interviewers have got
too big for their headsets.
''They think that their own personal opinions and their own political
opinions are equally important as Opposition leaders and Government
Ministers'. I think it's a wrong style of interviewing.''
The BBC rejected this criticism. The managing director of BBC news and
current affairs, Tony Hall, issued a statement insisting: ''We stand by
the integrity and professionalism of our journalists.
''It is their job to ask all parties, government and opposition, the
questions the public want answered.
''We will continue to be vigorous though fair in the pursuit of those
answers and report impartially without fear or favour from any side.''
The whole row started after Mr Aitken claimed that John Humphrys, of
the Today programme, had interrupted Chancellor Kenneth Clarke 32 times
during an interview on February 10. Mr Humphrys hotly contests the
allegation concerning the number of his interruptions.
In the Commons, Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith insisted that a
crucial part of producing programmes in the UK is to make sure that
there is an independent-minded BBC.
''Tough, vigorous questioning of us politicians by BBC journalists is
an essential part of the democratic process,'' he said.
He demanded: ''Will you now tell Mr Aitken and Environment Secretary
John Gummer that the BBC are doing their proper questioning job, must
carry on doing it and must not be allowed to cave in to spurious Tory
pressure?''
Liberal Democrat spokesman Rober Maclennan pressed Heritage Secretary
Stephen Dorrell on his prime responsibility to ensure freedom of
expression.
Mr Dorrell replied: ''Surely the position that all of us should adopt
is to aspire to high standards of independence and recognise that
occasionally we don't meet them and the important thing is to learn by
our mistakes.''
Later Tory Nick Hawkins (Blackpool South), in a point of order,
suggested Mr Humphrys' action in chairing an education rally at
Westminster last week should be referred to the Nolan committee on
public standards.
Speaker Betty Boothroyd told him: ''If you believe it is a matter you
could refer to the Nolan committee, knowing the terms of reference of
that committee, you are perfectly free yourself to refer it to that
committee.''
An attack on the BBC by Cabinet ministers is unsettling the Tory
Party, who read it as a sure sign that the Government is in trouble.
Those who remember the outgoing months of the last Labour Government
in the seventies recognise the signs of a Government in difficulty.
Coupling this with the speculation against the party chairman
underlines this freling of unease on the Tory back benches.
Mr Hanley does not command their heartfelt support because of a series
of maladroit observations and they do not know how to rally round their
party chairman.
These two factors coincide with renewed speculation that the Prime
Minister will face a challenge to his leadership from the parliamentary
party thus autumn.
The only way he might head this off if a July reshuffle, including the
removal of Mr Hanley -- the man he had chosen to go into the next
General Election with him. This proposition provides so many
difficulties for the Prime Minister that it is unlikely to happen, even
if the Tories lose more than a thousand local council seats in the
coming elections in Scotland next week and in England and Wales in May.

THE FAMILY of a Davie Cooper fan who died from the same cause as the
footballer are to receive an out-of-court settlement from Greater
Glasgow Health Board.
Deborah Hendry was almost the same age as her idol when she died in
the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow from a subarachnoid haemorrhage
-- the result of a cerebral aneurysm.
Unlike Mr Cooper, Ms Hendry, 40, could have been forewarned of her
condition and had an operation to clip the affected artery -- she had
had a similar operation in 1988, three years before her death, when an
aneurysm in another artery started to bleed.
But the man who performed the operation, consultant neurosurgeon Mr
John Wilden, did not tell her then that there was a second aneurysm. Nor
did he tell her family, or her family doctor.
The following year Mr Wilden was suspended from his job at the
hospital's Institute for Neurological Sciences after complaints from
colleagues.
In 1992 Ms Hendry, who had been suffering headaches, collapsed and was
taken to hospital, where she died a few days later.
Her GP told a fatal accident inquiry the following year that his
treatment of her would have been different if he had been aware of her
true condition.
Neurosurgeon Mr Douglas Gentleman, who attended Ms Hendry when she was
admitted for the last time, said action earlier in the week might have
given her a better chance of survival, and that if he had been
responsible for her care previously he would have advised an operation
to clip the second aneurysm.
Mr Wilden told the inquiry that he had withheld the information
because he did not think Ms Hendry would have wanted another operation.
The settlement, to Ms Hendry's daughter Laura, 19, now living in
London, and her mother, Jean, is in five figures but is understood to be
considerably less than the board paid to see the back of Mr Wilden.
Mrs Hendry said yesterday: ''Deborah's death seems to be in my mind
continually. The Davie Cooper tragedy brought it home again. It seems so
unfair -- she should have been told, I am sure she would preferred to go
for the chance of an operation if she had known.''
After the inquiry Sheriff Susan Raeburn said that it would have been a
reasonable precaution, which might have avoided Ms Hendry's death, if
she had been informed about the existence of the unruptured aneurysm.

Players and the fans say their own farewells to a quiet star who let
his skill do the talking
Report: GAVIN BELL and IAN PAUL Funeral pictures: PAUL HACKETT and
JEFF MITCHELL
THE bus taking the official Motherwell Fooball Club party to the
funeral had gone. The entrance to Fir Park stadium was closed, and a
cold wind whipped along an empty street, leaving Davie Cooper alone with
that enigmatic smile of his.
His image looked out from the glass portals, an old newspaper
photograph pasted on a piece of paper above a handwritten message:
''Davie you're simply the best. Your skill and talent will never be
forgotten. From your beloved fans.''
The wind stirred the scarves, the flags, and the emblems of half a
dozen football clubs surrounding the portrait, breathing a kind of life
into the cameo. A street-sweeper appeared, paused to look at the
photograph, and out came another memory of the modest magician who
enchanted a generation of football fans with his sublime skills, and
charmed them with his shy smile. ''We'll no' see the likes of him again
for a while,'' the cleaner said.
The sentiment was shared by thousands who thronged the iron railings
and the streets around Hillhouse Parish Church a few miles away in
Hamilton yesterday. The memories went back to the wee boy who did magic
things with a tanner ba'.
''There was never any airs and graces about the boy,'' commented a
woman whose sons had played with Davie for a local boys' club. ''Even
when he signed for the Rangers he wis just an ordinary workin' class
laddie, so he wis. The money never went tae his heid.''
For once the crowd was silent when Cooper appeared for the last time,
in a coffin draped with floral bouquets. As the cortege moved slowly
away from the church towards a cemetery two miles away, it was followed
at a respectful distance by a sea of humanity. Other mourners lining the
route stepped forward to touch the windows of the hearse as it crept by.
Some of us were mourning his passing for the second time. The first
was when he left Motherwell in December 1993, after four seasons of
delighting the Fir Park faithful with his special brand of magic and
mastery of the beautiful game.
We quickly forgave Davie for tearing our team to ribbons in his
previous life as a Rangers player. We welcomed him among us as a
Motherwell man, and we cheered when he tormented opponents.
When our defence was in trouble, which was frequently the case, we
heaved a collective sigh of relief when the ball broke to Davie. He
would get us out of a sticky situation, we believed, and he invariably
did.
When we had possession, the cry went up: ''Gie the ba' tae Davie.''
When somebody did, we felt a thrill of anticipation as he collected the
ball, shrugged off a challenge, and duly dispatched a defence-splitting
pass. He was our Roy of the Rovers and our Captain Marvel rolled into
one.
Our big day came on May 18, 1991, when Motherwell shrugged off the
depression of losing its steel industry, and marched to Hampden to take
on Dundee United in the Scottish Cup Final. When our team came out to
warm up, we cried like Clydebank and Rangers fans before us: ''One Davie
Cooper, there's only one Davie Cooper.''
On cue, the wee man flicked the ball from his left foot to his knee,
on to his head, stepped forward and then flicked it casually to a
team-mate. The chorus of adulation swelled, and Davie turned to wave at
us with a cheeky grin. We knew then instinctively that we couldn't lose.
Our modest magician was on form, and was about to transform us into cup
winners for only the second time in our history. And so it proved.
Now the magic has gone, but the memories and the echoes linger.
''There's only one Davie Cooper,'' we chanted at Hampden. We were right,
of course.
* FOOTBALL'S brotherhood, which rarely unites in common cause, paid
their dues to one of the greatest stars in the clan, Davie Cooper. Yet
it was the number gathered in the streets outside, many thousands of
them, which perhaps would have both astonished and thrilled the
phlegmatic Cooper.
The funeral of the former Clydebank, Rangers and Motherwell star
attracted famous managers, famous players, famous commentators and a
host of less familiar faces, every one there to declare his or her own
sense of loss, but the fans standing silent in Clarkwell Road and all
roads leading to it were the real testament to the impact Cooper's
talent had on the game in Scotland.
That is not to say that Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United,
former Rangers manager Graeme Souness, Tommy Burns of Celtic, Tommy
McLean of Hearts or anyone else among the representatives of every club
in the land had any less appreciation of the ability that shone at
Kilbowie Park, Ibrox, Fir Park and beyond. The Rangers team bus, packed
to capacity, was in itself ample illustration of how highly Cooper, who
died of a brain haemorrhage on Thursday, was rated at Ibrox.
It was their manager, Walter Smith, who led the eulogies and their
striker, Ally McCoist, who concluded them. ''There was nothing
complicated about Davie,'' said Smith, ''In his football he did the
simple things . . . and his skill was touched by genius. God gave him a
great gift, but I don't think He could be disappointed in the way it was
used.''
McCoist, who tackled what must have been an ordeal with commendable
courage, ended his stint with the words: ''He was a remarkable talent
and a fine, fine man.''
The attendance at the parish church overspilled into the hall next
door and into the streets outside. In the hall, the same hall where
Cooper had learned the disciplines of the Boys' Brigade, many players,
officials, wives and girlfriends were moved by the service piped through
speakers. Andy Ritchie, a player of special skills himself, was there,
as were Hibs' Keith Wright and Gordon Hunter, Celtic physio Brian Scott
and youth coach Tom McAdam, players of Hamilton Accies, Raith Rovers,
Falkirk and many others.
In the church, as well as Burns, Billy Stark was there from Celtic, as
was a devastated Charlie Nicholas, who was the last man to speak to
Cooper before he collapsed on Wednesday, former Old Firm men Maurice
Johnston and Frank McAvennie, and a host of others, including current
and former Motherwell and Clydebank colleagues.
They sang the hymns, struggling emotionally through the finale, Abide
With Me, rekindled fond memories, shook hands and strode out into the
cold, clear Hamilton air. For once, united. Coop would have been amazed.

PEERS last night stepped up the pressure on the Government over the
threat to the Fort William sleeper and Motorail services.
However, junior Transport Minister Viscount Goschen insisted:
''Decisions about individual services are a commercial matter for BR.
''It's for them to judge the market. Ministers have no powers to
direct them on matters relating to the provision of individual
services.''
During a Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Gray called for the services to
be retained at least until the consultation process was completed.
He said he was concerned about the economic well-being of the Western
Highlands and that he considered the transport infrastructure absolutely
essential. The railway was a key component and the sleeper and Motorial
services were a key part.
Lord Gray, who has an address in Argyll, also challenged the
Government over its figures on the subsidy given to the sleeper and,
while he said he was not against the principle of privatisation, he
called for a more entrepeneurial approach to the line.
He said: ''This is not a privatisation debate, but proposed axing of
this service has aroused passion and the public debate has thus far
engendered more heat than light.
''Surely, when so much is at stake for a heavily subsidised economy
the decision to subsidise or not to subsidise an important aspect of
infrastructure should be a hands-on political decision taken from the
wider viewpoint.
''One might have hoped that privatisation would afford opportunity for
entrepeneurial improvement rather than a death sentence.''
Highland Tory peer Lord Rankeillour made a passionate appeal for the
service to be preserved.
''Our lifeline would be snuffed out like a candle flame -- there a
moment before but suddenly stone dead.''
Lord Rankeillour said: ''I am an ardent passenger in it and have been
since a boy, when the station was the hub of our village universe. Does
BR not know the word amenity? Does it not care?
''The West Highland line isn't just a statistic in BR's company books:
it's our lifeline and a living legend, an old scenic marvel admired
throughout the world, a fast, vital means of transport between calm and
chaos.
''By keeping the railways and Royal Mail under Government eyes, I
would feel a lot safer than if they are just thrown to the avaricious
wolves.''
Tory ex-Minister Lord Renton, predicting an increase in tourist
traffic, said the service was ''truly essential'' for now and the
future.
Winding up the debate for Labour, former EC transport commissioner
Lord Clinton-Davies, for Labour, said the West Highland Sleeper's losses
were ''chicken-feed compared to the amount that has been squandered on
privatisation''.
He said: ''What this is really about is reducing the rail network to a
core of lines requiring no subsidy.
''It sets an appalling precedent. It isn't fair. It isn't reasonable.
It isn't democratic, and all concerned should think again.''
For the Government, Viscount Goschen indicated no change to the
consultation procedure, but insisted minds were not yet closed.
He emphasised that Rail Franchising Director Roger Salmon had yet to
reach a final decision on the setting of service requirements for future
private operators.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney had asked BR to ensure all
stock and assets be ''kept available at least until the end of the
consultation process''.
The Minister added that Mr Salmon had a duty to secure efficiency and
economy and that the preliminary announcement had been ''to calm
speculation'' on service closures.
Lord Goschen said the current subsidy for the West Highland sleeper,
at #450 per passenger journey, was not far short of the annual subsidy
for commuters in South-east England.
The service was used by only 18 passengers per train in winter and 36
in summer, while Motorail carried only 17,600 cars in a full year.
''Faced with these figures, it's not surprising that the Franchising
Director reached the view he did,'' Lord Goschen said.
''His mind is not closed, but it would be wrong to try to fossilise
the existing pattern of services.''

CLAIMS for compensation against a vegetable produce company following
the recent water contamination scare at Freuchie in Fife have been
handed over to lawyers, it was confirmed yesterday.
About 600 villagers, representing half the population, had to be
vaccinated against possible infection from Hepatitis A in an emergency
programme set up by Fife Health Board.
Executives at the nearby Kettle Produce company later admitted that
they were ''unwittingly to blame'' for causing the infection.
The company apologised to hundreds of people who attended a meeting in
the village church to hear explanations for the contamination.
The company is still working with water officials to discover how the
polluted water found its way into the mains system.
Solicitor and local community councillor Mr Angus Wood said yesterday
that he had so far received 20 claims, with more expected.
He stated: ''They have to be treated as individual claims, ranging
from discomfort as a result of the contamination to loss of wages.
''Amounts could range from #175 to higher figures.''
He said that as soon as all claims had been submitted, talks would
begin with the company and its insurers in an effort to achieve
equitable settlements.
Fife Health Board said yesterday that one child was still receiving
treatment at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh for an
enteritis-related illness.
However, the child was expected to be released within the next few
days.

THE controversial restrictions which govern fresh evidence appeals in
Scotland need not be a legal straitjacket leading to injustice, a
leading judge has indicated.
Lord McCluskey, one of the five judges who last week expressly
disapproved of an attempt by Lord Justice-General Hope to liberalise the
system, takes the view that the current law can be interpreted in a
flexible manner.
He thinks that even without the legislation which has been called for
by critics of the appeal court, judges can be more indulgent than they
have sometimes been in the past in fresh evidence cases.
He bases his view on the interpretation of the word ''reasonably''
which appears in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, as amended
by the 1980 Criminal Justice Act.
The interpretation of the law has led to an unprecedented split
between one division of the Court of Criminal Appeal, chaired by Lord
Hope, and the other division, presided over by Lord Ross, the Lord
Justice-Clerk.
The dispute centres on cases in which someone who has been convicted
claims that since his trial credible and reliable new evidence has
emerged which casts serious doubt on his guilt.
The legislation allows the appeal court to hear additional evidence if
the evidence was not heard at the trial, was not available and could not
reasonably have been made available at the trial.
Last month however, Lord Hope, supported by Lords Allanbridge and
Brand, decided to allow an appeal in a case even although the additional
evidence was available at the trial.
They decided that the appeal could go ahead as long as there was a
reasonable explanation for the evidence not being produced earlier. The
reasonable explanation test is the one laid down for the Court of Appeal
in England by the 1968 Criminal Appeal Act.
Lord Ross cast immediate doubt on whether Lord Hope had been correct
and the case was sent to five judges to test the law. Last Friday, the
five judges expressly disapproved of Lord Hope's reading of the law.
Lords Ross, McCluskey, Morison, Morton and Cowie stated that the law
was quite clear and that the other three judges had gone against their
own previous decisions in the way they had reinterpreted it.
Lord Ross pointed out that it was Parliament, not the appeal court,
which had imposed restrictions on the leading of fresh evidence appeals
and the court had to apply the law as it stood.
Lord McCluskey agreed, but in his written opinion expressed the view
that in the past the appeal court might have applied the restrictions
too harshly.
The fact that in some cases the court's judgment might be thought to
have been ''relatively harsh'' could not, however, warrant the ''novel,
unprecedented and unsupportable'' construction of the law adopted by
Lords Hope, Allanbridge and Brand.
The Scottish appeals system is currently being reviewed by a
Government-appointed committee, of which Lord Ross is a member.

Brussels
MICHAEL Portillo, the Euro-sceptic Employment Secretary, yesterday
fought his EU counterparts to a draw after a day of wrangling in the
Council of Ministers.
He managed to put off, temporarily, a proposal aimed at giving workers
from one EU country equal pay and conditions with those applying in
richer states to which they are sent to work.
The draft directive would theoretically benefit up to 100,000 British
workers, many in the construction trade, who work in Germany and whose
pursuit of work has become known as the ''Auf Wiedersehn, Pet'' system,
after the television sitcom of that name.
The outcome, however temporary, will be regarded by British Tory
Euro-sceptics as a success. In fact, the EU's 15 member states split
into three groups, divided over how long workers should be employed
before the rules became operative. Only Britain stood out against the
idea in principle.
The workers most affected are men, and a few women mainly in domestic
employment, who travel to the richer countries of Europe in search of
temporary work, normally at higher pay rates than those available in the
UK. Many Irish, Greek and Portuguese workers could also benefit from the
scheme.
Ministers were debating a politically-difficult question against a
background of social tensions created by more than 20 million unemployed
in the European Union. In Germany alone the number of foreign workers,
many of them legal immigrants but illegal workers, has caused social
unrest.
Mr Portillo faced probable defeat in the council if the matter had
been put to a vote. In the event, the French presidency decided not to
call for one, stating that it was obvious there could be no consensus.
If the British stand had failed it would have been the first time
British objections to the so-called Social Europe had been defeated on a
formal vote.
Instead the French decided there was stalemate and opted to bring the
matter back for discussion in June. ''It was clear there could be no
agreement,'' a British official said later.
Mr Portillo was said to be ''irritated'' that the council had spent a
day discussing the matter without success. But his contribution to the
debate led to no change of heart by any member state.
Later he issued a formal statement expressing disappointment that a
day had been spent ''discussing this directive on which there was little
prospect of agreement.'' He added: ''We should have been discussing how
to make it easier to find work, not how to resist it.''
Much division was caused by the idea of having a threshold for how
soon the improved pay rates would apply. Some states wanted it applied
immediately immigrant workers started their jobs because domestic laws
for protecting labour and collective agreements would otherwise be
diluted. Others wanted delays, and a third group wanted different
periods for different countries.
Mr Portillo denounced the Commission's ideas as he left Brussels early
for last night's three-line whip vote in the Commons. ''The EU is
becoming a paradise not for workers but for lawyers,'' he complained. He
said several member states had ''real problems'' with the draft
directive.
''But we want to make it easier for one person to give another a job
anywhere in Europe,'' he said.
He took issue with the French version of events, supported by Mr
Padraig Flynn, European Commissioner for Social Affairs, in which the
dispute was described as ''a better grasp of each other's view'' leading
probably to a settlement in June.
Mr Portillo said: ''I was one of many delegates expressing grave
concern at the implications of denying poorer countries access to world
markets. That is the route to perpetual poverty.'' After a morning
meeting -- where Mr Portillo was reportedly less vociferous in his
attitudes than he was earlier in radio interviews -- he said his
position was unchanged.
As Ministers continued to debate the issue over lunch, he left for
London saying there were differences to be resolved between the Germans,
French and Belgians on one side who wanted the measures to apply
immediately and the others.
One of his officials said after the stalemate was announced: ''It is
good that this directive has not been passed because it would have been
burdensome on business.''

ALMOST over the sea to Skye: only about 100ft now separates the two
ends of the new bridge linking the island to the mainland.
Apparently unruffled by the controversy which continues to rage around
the flagship of the Government's private road building programme,
developers Miller Dywidag are on schedule to complete the construction
within the next few months.
The #25m bridge is due to be officially opened this autumn, an act of
enormous significance -- both symbolic and actual -- for Skye.
Opponents of the bridge, which is likely to have the highest toll
charges in Europe at about #5.20 for a single crossing, have banded
together in the Skye Bridge Appeal Group.
Last week, The Herald revealed that the new road link could face
competition from the existing Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service between
Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin.
Until the enactment of the 1993 Railway Act, only the Scottish
Transport Users' Consultative Committee had the power to call a public
inquiry into the withdrawal of a ferry service.
Pending a ruling from the Scottish Office, the committee has asked
CalMac to advertise its planned closure of the ferry, and intends to
hold an inquiry if there are sufficient objections. That inquiry is
unlikely to be completed before the bridge opens.

<RECORDNO>979173662</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SELF-CONFESSED arsonist David Lauwers was yesterday jailed for life at
the Old Bailey for the manslaughter of victims of a porn cinema club
blaze.
Lauwers -- known as Deaf Dave -- was cleared by a jury of eight women
and four men of three representative charges of murder and also of
setting fire to the club intending to endanger life.
Eleven men died and 15 were injured in the blaze which engulfed the
New City club in Smithfield, central London.
The 35-year-old tailor's assistant, of no fixed address, had admitted
manslaughter and the lesser charge of reckless arson earlier during his
five-day trial.
After the verdicts it emerged that Lauwers had been put on probation
three years earlier for another arson attack -- after a dispute with a
former girlfriend.
The Recorder of London, Sir Lawrence Verney, told Lauwers that a long
sentence was necessary ''in order to protect the public from serious
harm from you''.
The judge passed life sentences on all three counts of manslaughter to
run concurrently -- and ordered Lauwers should not be considered for
release for at least 10 years.
Lauwers winked and shook hands with his interpreter as the sentence
was relayed to him by sign language.
Lauwers started the fire in February last year after a violent row
with the club's doorman over the entrance fee. He was drunk and
aggressive, the court heard.
At a near-by filling station, he bought a can of petrol, went back,
sprayed it over the entrance lobby -- and ignited it.
About 30 people were in the club's two small cinemas, which showed
non-stop heterosexual porn during opening hours.
Flames swept through the four-storey building in minutes, trapping
people inside.
Mr John Nutting, prosecuting, told the court: ''Electric lights went
out and dense smoke quickly rose up through the building. Some tried to
descend the main staircase, but were driven back by the intensity of the
heat and were unable to breathe.''
In his summing-up, the Recorder said the building was a potential
death trap.
''The only effective exit was down the main stairs and out of the
front door, but this route was blocked by fire as soon as it started,''
he said.
All the windows were boarded over. An exit to neighbouring premises
was boarded up, another was padlocked and an internal staircase was shut
off, the judge said.
The jury had to decide whether Lauwers intended to kill or do serious
harm, in which case he would have been guilty of murder.
Mr Rock Tansey, QC, defending Lauwers, told the court that when his
client heard of the death toll on the TV news ''he could not believe
people had died or been injured''.
''He was petrified over what had happened and gave himself up to the
police,'' he said.
Outside the court, Mr Donald Payne, brother of fire victim Maurice
Payne, said: ''We're not exactly over the moon about the verdict and
sentence -- it's less than a year for each life.''

ACTRESS Dorothy Paul helped to launch the Herald's Campaign for
Women's Health yesterday with a free coffee morning for around 200 at
the Glasgow Moat House hotel.
She said: ''Over 20,000 women die unnecessarily every year because
their condition is not diagnosed in time. The Herald Campaign for
Women's Health aims to raise women's awareness on all health issues.''
The first objective of the campaign is to raise #100,000 for a
secondary care clinic for gynaecological and related problems at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary. More than #25,000 has been raised already.
Two doctors closely involved in the project, Dr Helen McEwan and Dr
Alan Mathers, explained how the clinic will work.
Dr McEwan said: ''Basically it will be a 'One-Stop' clinic. Patients
will be referred through their GP and they will be given a management
menu. Instead of having to see several different doctors in different
parts of the hospital, it will all be done in one clinic.''
An important feature of the new clinic, which should open early this
summer, is that great emphasis will be placed on making it
user-friendly.
Mr Drew Plunkett, head of interior design at Glasgow School of Art, is
designing the clinic to create a relaxed, informal atmophere. He admits
that turning a hospital suite at the Royal Infirmary into a
sophisticated and welcoming environment is quite a challenge.
Dr Mathers pointed out: ''Nobody likes going to hospital, but we hope
that this new clinic will become a role model for others in the future,
making it a friendly and welcoming place.''
The coffee morning fund-raising scheme works on the principle of the
inverted pyramid. A hostess invites six guests for coffee and charges #2
per person. These guests then go away and each invite a further five,
who in turn have a coffee morning or afternoon tea for four guests under
the same conditions.
The process continues until one final person has one guest for coffee.
Providing the chain is not broken, every hostess who launches a party
of six should generate a total of #3912.
It's anticipated this fund-raising venture should raise at least
#500,000.
Anyone interested in organising a coffee morning can obtain free
leaflets from our marketing department at Albion Street in Glasgow or by
telephoning 0141 552 6255.

<HEADLINE>Jail cut for man who hid IRA arms</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE man convicted of hiding IRA arms for the Warrington gasworks
bombers, had his 20-year jail sentence cut to 16 years by the Court of
Appeal in London yesterday.
John Kinsella, 50, who has always maintained his innocence, told the
appeal judges as he left the dock: ''While I appreciate the reduction in
sentence, this case is a mockery of British justice.''
Kinsella, a Dubliner who has lived most of his life in Nottingham, was
jailed at the Old Bailey in February 1994 for having an explosive
substance with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to
property or enable others to do so.
His nephew, Denis Kinsella, 25, recruited as the terrorists' driver,
and IRA activist Pairic MacFhloinn, 40, were sentenced to 25 years and
35 years respectively for causing an explosion; attempting to murder a
police officer who was shot by MacFhloinn when he tried to search their
van; kidnapping a motorist by hi-jacking his car and locking him in the
boot; and possessing a firearm.
MacFhloinn's partner in the actual bombing, Michael Timmins, escaped
and has never been brought to justice.
Appeals by all three convicted men were dismissed last November, but
John Kinsella was given leave to challenge his sentence.
Lord Justice Swinton Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Latham and Mr
Justice Morison said that Kinsella was convicted of a very serious
crime, but he was not connected with the IRA and had played no part in
the bombing.
His counsel, Ms Helena Kennedy, QC, yesterday produced a letter
written by MacFhloinn from prison on March 13 stating that Kinsella was
''totally innocent'' and his case was ''a gross miscarriage of
justice''.

A MAN found guilty of indecently assaulting a 15-year-old boy has had
his conviction quashed because of a sheriff's unacceptable behaviour at
his trial.
At one point during the proceedings against Mr James Sneddon, Sheriff
Rosaleen Morrison asked the mother of the alleged victim: ''Has a man
ever thrown himself at you in the heat of sexual excitement?''
Also, immediately after convicting Mr Sneddon, the sheriff said to
him: ''You did this, didn't you?'' When he denied it, she added: ''You
did it. You did it. You did it. I know that you did it.''
Three judges in the Justiciary Appeal Court were highly critical of
Sheriff Morrison for her conduct of the case, and ''deplored'' the
intemperate language she used in giving her version of events to the
court.
When he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last year, Mr Sneddon, 37,
of Woodburn Drive, Dalkeith, Midlothian, denied fondling the boy's
private parts through his clothing.
Sheriff Morrison found him guilty after trial and ordered him to carry
out 120 hours' community service.
Mr Sneddon appealed, and his counsel, Mr John Beckett, accepted that
there had been enough evidence to convict his client. However, he
claimed that because of the way the sheriff had conducted the trial, Mr
Sneddon had not had a fair hearing and justice had not been seen to be
done.
The appeal judges were told that during her evidence the victim's
mother had said she did not think Mr Sneddon was guilty. In her opinion
a meeting between Mr Sneddon and her son had not lasted long enough for
the offence to be committed.
It was at that point that the sheriff was alleged to have asked the
witness whether a man had ever thrown himself at her in a state of
sexual excitement.
The defence solicitor complained about the question, but was informed
by the sheriff that he was being ''terribly juvenile'' about the whole
thing.
In her report to the appeal court, Sheriff Morrison disputed that she
had used these words, but the procurator-fiscal supported the defence's
version of events, and the appeal judges were satisfied that the
question had been asked.
The sheriff could not recall accusing the defence solicitor of being
juvenile, but did remember asking him if he had children and mentioning
that he looked far too young to be in the ''father category''.
She also conceded that she might have said to Mr Sneddon: ''You did
it. You know you did it.'' However, she asked the appeal judges whether
that would really matter, since she had already pronounced a guilty
verdict before the ''contretemps'' commenced.
Mr Beckett argued that the sheriff had demonstrated bias and prejudice
against the accused, and prematurely formed a concluded view of the
evidence. He claimed that her conduct of the case was out of keeping
with the dignity and proper conduct of a criminal court.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice-Clerk, who gave the opinion of the appeal
court, said it was unfortunate the sheriff had intervened in the
questioning of the alleged victim's mother in the way she had. The
question was not one that should have been asked.
As for what the sheriff had said at the end of the trial: ''For the
sheriff to utter these words immediately after finding Sneddon guilty
would, in our opinion, be bound to lead any observer to conclude that
the sheriff was exhibiting hostility towards him.''
They agreed that the sheriff's behaviour was out of keeping with the
dignity and proper conduct of a criminal case.
The judges also regarded it as ''quite out of place'' for Sheriff
Morrison to begin her report to the appeal court by talking of her
''justifiable outrage'' at the complaints against her.
She had also described claims of what she had asked the mother as an
''appalling and malevolent distortion'' of what actually happened, and
cast repeated aspersions on the defence solicitor.
Lord Ross added: ''In writing the report, it appears that the sheriff
has been unable to exercise restraint, and this merely confirms the
allegations to the effect that she exhibited a similar lack of restraint
during the trial.
''It is deplorable that the sheriff should have used so much
intemperate language in her report, and made it so highly tendentious.
The effect which the report has upon the court is merely to confirm that
the present case was one where justice was not seen to be done.''

EXCLUSIVE
By GRAEME SMITH
A MAJOR investigation is under way into allegations of irregularities
surrounding the breeding and sale of ponies by Aberdeen District
Council.
The Shetland Pony Stud-Book Society has demanded an explanation from
the council as to why, among other alleged irregularities, a pony
exported to Holland as a breeding stallion turned out not to have the
pedigree claimed. Blood tests carried out on the pony confirmed the
claims were incorrect.
The society, which is responsible for registering all ownership
transfers of Shetland ponies detailed in its stud book, is understood to
be taking a very serious view of the number of alleged irregularities
which have been uncovered concerning the oldest, pure-bred pony of the
nine native British breeds.
However, although last night the society confirmed it was
investigating it declined to give any details.
The Herald has learned that the allegations involve Shetland ponies
bred at Aberdeen District Council's Doonies Farm on the outskirts of the
city. The allegations include the use of false pedigrees, two ponies
being sold with identical pedigree certificates, the identifying numbers
of ponies being exchanged at sales, and ponies being sold as registered
ponies which have not in fact been registered.
The stud-book society, which is based in Perth, could refuse to accept
any future registrations from Aberdeen District Council if the problems
cannot be resolved satisfactorily.
Last night Aberdeen District Council issued a brief statement to The
Herald which said: ''We received a letter on Friday from the Shetland
Pony Stud-Book Society.
''The council are in the process of investigating the suggestion there
were irregularities in the issuing of Shetland pony pedigree
certificates.
''Arrangements are being made with the secretary of the society to
discuss the comments they have made.''
Mrs Grace Cook, the society secretary said: ''We were given various
information but it is under investigation so I don't really have any
more details on that.
''We handle mostly domestic registrations but we do have some
international registrations. Being the country of origin we hold the
mother stud book. We do have daughter societies in Europe and further
afield who have their own breed societies.
''Aberdeen District Council has bred quite a lot of ponies in the past
and although they are not one of our biggest breeders they have had a
considerable number in the past.''
She said problems did occur from time to time but the society tried to
deal with them as quickly as possible so ponies could be properly
identified and transferred.
''It is not common for mistakes but we are all fallible and mistakes
can happen.''
She said there could be a lot of money involved in the buying and
selling of Shetland ponies but the prices depended very much on the
location of the sale, whether it was a private sale or a sale at an
auction, and on the breeding of the animal.
She said the society tended not to give any idea of prices because it
did not deal with the commercial side of things.
Aberdeen District Council has enjoyed a high reputation for its horses
over a number of years and its Clydesdales have attracted worldwide
publicity.
Doonies Farm, to the south of the city, is a favourite attraction for
youngsters and although pet animals are kept at the farm for the
enjoyment of visitors it is run as a commercial farm.

POLICE who say they were mentally scarred by the horror of the
Hillsborough disaster felt they were let down by senior colleagues, a
court was told yesterday.
Six of the officers who coped with the dead and dying at the FA Cup
semi-final nearly six years ago have taken a controversial claim for
compensation against their own chief constable to the English High
Court.
Mr Benet Hytner, QC, representing 23 South Yorkshire officers claiming
damages over the tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died, told the
Sheffield hearing that they witnesses ''truly gruesome'' scenes.
Some officers who attempted to revive collapsed fans and then had to
deal with the mounting numbers of dead bodies had been left permanently
disabled -- and many had had to leave the force, he said.
One of the police in the test case, 47-year-old PC Anthony Bevis, who
tried in vain to resuscitate a young man on the pitch as his brother
begged him to save his life, told in a statement how the trauma of the
tragedy had forced him out of the police.
PC Bevis said he had dealt with all kinds of fatalities in his 13
years in the South Yorkshire force.
But he said: ''None of those deaths had previously affected me, for it
was a job that needed to be done.
''The difference with Hillsborough was the lack of preparation for
what we were about to face. We were abandoned by the senior officers in
an unknown situation.
''I felt totally betrayed by the senior officers whose job it was to
command. I also suffered from guilt from the fact that I should have
been able to do more.''
Another of the officers, Sergeant Janet Smith, 45, still has
nightmares about the tragedy and had to leave the police. She complained
that she had to strip and identify victims at the Northern general
hospital, where a mortuary had been set up.
''My greatest anxiety was dealing with the relatives,'' she said. ''I
feltthe South Yorkshire Police were lacking in care for the relatives
and for the officers.''
PC Mark Bairstow, 47, who said Hillsborough had changed his character,
added: ''My immediate reaction was one of anger towards my superiors. No
one appeared to be taking charge of the incident.
''That anger still exists. It appeared no one would make any sort of
decision.''
The tragedy in April 1989 was at the FA Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest played at Sheffield Wednesday's ground.
South Yorkshire Police, joint defendants with Sheffield Wednesday FC
and the club's engineers, have already admitted liability for the deaths
and injuries and in claims by 14 officers who suffered trauma after
carrying out rescue work.
The outstanding claims are in respect of officers who tried to
resuscitate fans on the pitch and staffed the mortuaries. Their claim
has been criticised by victims' relatives and by some senior officers.
Compensation being sought is reported to run to up to #250,000 in some
cases. Observers fear that a victory could trigger large numbers of
similar actions from members of the emergency and military services.
Mr Hytner told Mr Justice Waller that all the officers involved had
been diagnosed as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.
''The scenes that met the eyes of those in and near the pens was truly
gruesome,'' he said. ''Among the 500 dead and injured were corpses whose
faces were purple and otherwise hideous to behold.''
He said after the bodies were removed the scenes were again ''utterly
horrific''. Officers tried to identify victims amid a milling throng of
friends and relatives, ''some of whom were understandably hysterical
with grief and anxiety and were hostile to the police''.
''A considerable number of police officers suffered psychological
injury as a result,'' he said. ''Some have been completely disabled and
remain seriously ill. Others are rendered unfit for police service and
have been discharged from the force.''
He said the Chief Constable, Richard Wells, had been in breach of a
duty of care to the plaintiffs as serving officers.
''Some people in this case have failed to distinguish between a police
officer doing his public duty and attending events that are dangerous
and could lead to his own death, and with a chief constable who by
negligence creates a situation where his men are going to be hurt,''
said Mr Hytner.
Another of the officers in the test case, PC Geoffrey Glave, 45, a
father of two, said he had been particularly distressed by the number of
young people among the victims.
He told the court in a statement: ''What had started out as such a
lovely day suddenly became black and full of death.''
The hearing continues.

THE owners of a Scottish nursing home have raised actions for
defamation against two former staff who featured in a BBC documentary
that alleged ''appalling'' standards of care.
Lawyers for Mr Raymond Baigent and his wife Margaret, of Orchard House
Nursing Home, Crossford, Lanarkshire, said the writs had been lodged at

Their legal spokesman, Ms Helen Hepburn, of Glasgow firm Maxwell

It is understood advice is being sought from counsel before deciding
if the BBC, or others in the Frontline Scotland documentary earlier this

<TEXT>
THAT new programme Hamish Macbeth, which went out on the BBC on Sunday
night, fair caused a stooshie in the corridors of power in Northern
Constabulary.
An actor pretending to be a policeman in a fictitional West Highland
village called Lochdubh did some unprofessional things in the programme.
But the real force, based in Inverness, yesterday issued an official
statement to distance itself from the Beeb's shenanigans, filmed in
Plockton, Wester Ross.
Viewers commented on the likeness of the badge on the fictional
constable's diced cap to that worn by authentic officers in the
Highlands and Islands. That, however, was where the similarity ended.
Macbeth, played by Robert Carlyle, was seen assisting a poacher,
smoking an illegal substance, committing acts of petty vandalism, and
his long arms of the law apparently did more than embrace a fellow
officer of the female gender.
All of which was frowned upon by Northern Constabulary. It issued the
following official statement, headed BBC TV Programme -- Hamish Macbeth:
''Discerning viewers will appreciate that the programme is light
entertainment and should be regarded as such.''
The statement, from the force's control room at its HQ at Old Perth
Road, Inverness, went on: ''It will be obvious to anyone that it is far
removed from the realities of policing, professionally, and in many
other ways.''
A Northern force officer, who went to school in Plockton and who has a
name which is pronounced identically to the fictional Highland
policeman's, said he was constantly being ''ribbed'' by his colleagues
about the series.
The real PC Finlay MacBeath, who comes originally from Kishorn, Wester
Ross, revealed that he had had ''informal discussions'' with his Police
Federation representative about the potential confusion.
Constable MacBeath said he found it embarrassing being mixed up with
the fictional character.
Yesterday, at force HQ, spokesman Sergeant Bill MacLean said that the
statement had been made public because of the media interest in the
programme.
A spokesperson for the BBC in Glasgow attempted to heal any rift. He
said: ''Hamish Macbeth is a fictional character. He is not based on
anyone in particular. He is unconventional, with an unorthodox method of
solving crimes.''
Actor Carlyle said: ''Hamish Macbeth sees himself as the sheriff of a
one-horse town, with the role of keeping the peace.''
The series was made for the BBC by independent production company
Zenith, in association with Scotland's Skyline.
The character is based on books by Marion Chesney, who used the name M
C Beaton.
Until recently she lived in the Highlands in Lairg in Sutherland.
The first episode of the programme, which is broadcast throughout the
UK, went out on Sunday. BBC Scotland said that the unofficial audience
figures were 10 million, ''a fantastic figure for the first episode of
any new series''.

TWO hillwalkers were found safe and well yesterday after a Navy
helicopter crew spotted them after scouring the Ben Nevis area for an
hour.
Charles O'Neill, 27, and Hugh MacDonald, 30, both from Bonhill,
Dunbartonshire, had failed to return from a walk in the Loch Treig area
on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a Canadian woman was recovering in hospital yesterday after
falling 200ft on Saileag, in Kintail, Wester Ross, and breaking her leg.
A Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth took the woman to the
MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Skye and she was later transfered to
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.

A COMMEMORATIVE #2 coin was issued yesterday to mark the 50th
anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
It can be bought at its face value from banks and post offices
throughout the UK.
The coin was launched by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Master of the
Mint, at the Cabinet War Rooms.
At the launch, Mr Clarke told reporters he favoured the introduction
of a new #2 coin for general use.
''We put out to consultation whether people would like a #2 coin,'' he
said. ''I'm rather disposed to favour that myself.''
Mr Clarke said he was also in favour of a proposed new smaller 50p
coin.
The commemorative coin launched yesterday features a dove of peace and
the words ''In Peace Goodwill'', taken from the phrase used by Winston
Churchill:
''In war: resolution. In defeat: defiance. In victory: magnanimity. In
peace: goodwill.''

MILLIONAIRE David Jones, the former Timex worker who used his #3000
redundancy money to set up his own computer games business, yesterday
clinched a multi-million pound deal which will create 42 jobs in Dundee.
Mr Jones, 29, who created the best-selling Lemmings game, has signed a
contract with US multinational IBM to produce four new computer games.
Last year, Mr Jones was described as the Steven Spielberg of the
computer games industry when he won a multi-million pound order from
Nintendo, the Japanese computer corporation.
Mr Jones, a former electronics engineer with Timex, designed his first
computer game in the bedroom of his parents' home and used his #3000
redundancy money from Timex to set up DMA, his company.
His first computer game, Menace, sold 15,000 copies and Lemmings I has
sold more than two million copies.
DMA employs 40 people at the company's base on Dundee's Technology
Park. Mr Jones now intends to expand the workforce by 42 and is to lease
additional factory space.
The new games will be produced in partnership with Bertelsmann Music
Group and will be sold in more than 40 countries.
DMA general manager, Stuart Dell, said: '''We are extremely pleased as
this contract underlines our world-wide stature.
'''We are a Dundee company and always try to recruit locally. The jobs
are for technicians, programmers, artists and musicians. Some jobs will
also go to juniors who will be trained in-house.'
DMA games include Lemmings I and II, Uniracers, Walker and Hired Guns.

<HEADLINE>Kinnock bid for bus seatbelts EU Commissioner plans legislation to boost safety on all new coaches</HEADLINE>

NEIL Kinnock unveiled plans for compulsory fitting of seat belts in
all new coaches and minibuses yesterday in his first concrete proposals
for legislation since taking over as Europe's Transport Commissioner.
The plans exclude forcing operators to instal restraints in vehicles
which are already on the roads.
Mr Kinnock argued that it would not be practical to impose the new law
on coaches which are operating. Retrospective legislation was ruled out
on the grounds that many services would disappear because some current
coach or minibus designs cannot support the belt attachments.
Mr Kinnock stressed it was hoped to blend the security of children
with practicalities, so long as higher safety standards were being
undertaken. Speaking in Glasgow at the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accident's 60th Congress, he added that he hoped for British support
for the proposals which he believed would save lives and reduce
injuries.
Last week, the Government announced lap belts will be required in all
minibuses and coaches used by children under the age of 16 on organised
trips.
Operators will be given 12 months to fit the belts after the
regulations are laid down. Strathclyde Regional Council has already made
three-point belts obligatory on all minibuses used for transporting
schoolchildren. However, neither the UK nor European proposals cover
double-decker or service buses, often used for school transport.
The Belt Up School Kids campaign, founded after two boys were killed
in last year's Biggar bus crash, will continue to campaign for phasing
out double-deckers on contract runs.
The call for action reached a crescendo after the Biggar incident,
which followed the death of a teacher and 12 children from the West
Midlands in a minibus on the M40, and a coach overturning on the M2 in
Kent, killing nine American tourists and the driver.
Mr Kinnock's plans go further than Britain's -- all coaches above
three-and-a-half tonnes will require aeroplane-style lap belts, while
van-type minibuses, common in the UK, will require full three-point
belts on forward facing seats.
The directive would apply to all new coaches, not just school
transport, because Mr Kinnock believes all passengers should benefit
from the increased protection.
Mr Kinnock said the legislation should be in place by the end of next
year.
He told the congress: ''Implementation of these changes will
undoubtably save lives and prevent or reduce injuries. Any procedural,
political, or commercial resistance to the proposals must, because of
that fundamental point alone, be overcome.''
Mr Kinnock, who as a beltless back seat passenger survived a 65mph
crash in which his chauffeur died in 1990, revealed in his speech that
he is:
* Not yet in favour of compulsory crash helmets for cyclists. He cited
contradictory evidence about their benefits, and suggested they can be
linked to declining interest in cycling;
* Regrets the fact that the UK is the only EU government allowing
current holders of a standard driving licence to drive school transport
-- an exemption from EU rules agreed in 1991;
* Wants EU countries to ban bull-bars on four-wheel drive vehicles
because they are ''dangerous affectations'' which can turn minor
pedestrian accidents into serious ones, and:
* Supports greater restrictions on power motorbikes among the young,
regardless of the cultures of member states.
Mr Kinnock described Europe's 50,000 road deaths and one-and-a-half
million injuries every year as appalling, and stressed safety was his
highest priority as Commissioner.
His announcement on compulsory seat belts was welcomed by the
Confederation of Passenger Transport UK, formerly the Bus and Coach
Council. A spokesman said: ''We are keen to see any move that increases
safety.''

A POLITICAL row has broken out over a proposal to change the name of
the Old Royal High School building in Edinburgh, earmarked as the home
of a Scottish parliament, to New Parliament House.
A motion proposing the change has come from Edinburgh District
Council's ruling Labour group. It will be put to the council's policy
and resources committee on Thursday.
District council leader Lesley Hinds said the change of name
demonstrated the Labour Party's commitment to safeguarding the building
as the future home of a Scottish parliament.
However, Edinburgh Lord Provost Norman Irons said he saw little point
in changing the name until there was a Scottish parliament.
Mr Irons, an SNP councillor said: ''There is little difference between
calling it Old Royal High School or New Parliament House just now.
Neither of the two exist.''
Conservative councillor Moira Knox said she was against changing the
name.
''This is a magnificent building designed by a famous architect.
''There is absolutely no reason to change the name. It's obviously
just a political move and just a sop.
''My advice to the Labour Party would be to ca'canny and wait to see
what happens,'' she said.
However, Councillor Hinds said changing the new name of the Old Royal
High School was an important step.
She added: ''Clearly we could not continue to call it the Old Royal
High School, which was becoming confusing and meaningless.
''New Parliament House better reflects the view which most Scots have
of the future role and function of the building.
''This building has many of the facilities already in place -- so it
is clearly the most sensible location. It has also become a symbol for
all those who believe in a Scottish parliament.
''I have consulted Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson who
agrees that the name change is an excellent idea.''
The Old Royal High School at the foot of Calton Hill was designed by
Thomas Hamilton and building work began in 1825.
It was earmarked for the Scottish parliament proposed in the 1979
referendum. The building lay empty for two years in the early 1980s
before the Crown Office took up residence. It moved out last year.
The building, which is now owned by Edinburgh District Council, has
become a focus of the campaign for a parliament in Scotland with
Democracy for Scotland campaigners camped at its gates.

THOUSANDS of fans and friends yesterday gathered to pay their last
respects to Davie Cooper, the gentlemanly genius of Scottish football.
There were so many mourners that they brought much of his hometown of
Hamilton, Lanarkshire, to a standstill.
Famous footballing figures were joined by crowds of faithful fans in
bidding an emotional farewell to the former Rangers and Scotland star
who died last Thursday from a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 39.
A congregation of 400 packed the Hillhouse parish church for the
funeral service. But many more mourners gathered outside the church and
lined the route to Bent Road cemetery, where the family held a private
burial ceremony.
Many of the mourners standing outside the church wept as they listened
to tributes from Rangers striker Ally McCoist and Ibrox manager Walter
Smith, which were relayed by loudspeakers.
McCoist, a close friend as well as former team-mate, recalled how he
joined Rangers in 1983, when Cooper was already an established star. ''I
watched, listened, and learned from Davie. I learned the importance of
strength of character.''
Closing his tribute, he described Cooper as ''a remarkable talent and
a fine, fine man'' and added simply: ''God bless you, Davie''.
Smith told mourners: ''Somebody once said simplicity was genius, and
Davie Cooper's football was touched by genius. God gave him a great gift
and I don't think He can be disappointed about the way he used it.''
Church minister the Rev Jim Mackenzie said Cooper had been one of
those rare people who was regarded by everyone who met him as a genuine
gentleman.
Although some of the top Scottish footballers could not attend the
funeral because of the national squad's European championship qualifying
match in Moscow, all 40 senior Scottish league clubs were represented.
The stars were not restricted to the world of soccer. Among the
mourners were members of pop group Wet Wet Wet, including lead singer
Marti Pellow.
Lining the path to the church door were hundreds of wreaths, among
them one from rock star Rod Stewart with the message: ''One of
Scotland's greatest. He will be sadly missed.''
Family members at the service included Cooper's parents Jock and Jean,
and his brother John. His wife Christine, from whom he separated several
years ago, and his girlfriend Liz Thomson were also present.
Cooper began his career with Clydebank before moving in 1977 to Ibrox,
where he spent 12 years and collected many honours. He then moved to
Motherwell, where he won a Scottish Cup winners' medal in 1991, and
rejoined his first club in December, 1993, as player-coach.

<HEADLINE>Professor rejects a price for devolution Professor's 'benign view' of devolution Investors 'not frightened'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALF YOUNG, ECONOMICS EDITOR AND ROBBIE DINWOODIE, SCOTTISH POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A FORMER director of Locate in Scotland has rejected claims that
political devolution will frighten inward investment away from Scotland.
In a paper now circulating within the business community, Professor
Neil Hood argues what he calls the relatively benign view that ''there
is no prima facie case for claiming that devolution as currently
proposed will have a negative effect on Scotland's position for either
inward investment attraction or development''.
Labour leader Tony Blair, on a visit to Glasgow yesterday, criticised
the ''Tory lie machine'' which said Scottish self-determination would
put 20p in the pound on income tax north of the Border.
Professor Hood, who ran LiS between 1987 and 1989, and is an
acknowledged expert on inward investment, is now based at the
International Business Unit at Strathclyde University. He is also a
non-executive director of a clutch of Scottish companies, including
Grampian Holdings and Kwik-Fit, and is a strategic adviser to
ScottishPower.
Writing from ''a neutral political perspective'', Professor Hood
argues that the uncertainties surrounding constitutional change do not
match the shifts in technological advantage, market demand, and exchange
rate volatility already handled by multinational companies on an ongoing
basis.
Nor does he believe that the fiscal freedoms Labour plans for a
Scottish Assembly -- the ability to vary income tax up or down by a
maximum 3p in the pound -- will change ''the factor conditions which
initially led these companies to be in Scotland''.
He considers claims that higher per capita public expenditure in
Scotland might subsequently generate differential taxation right across
the board but calls them ''a rather malevolent scenario'' and adds:''A
more benign interpretation would assume the continuing and long-standing
commitment to the promotion of economic development in Scotland and even
the potential introduction of more positive measures to stimulate
economic growth, thereby enhancing the Scottish case for investment
attraction and development, provided this could be afforded without
significant changes in the relative tax position.
''In summary, while there are undeniable uncertainties associated with
any constitutional change their effects may well be neutral over the
short to medium term.''
The paper, which consciously does not speculate on whether devolution
might lead to independence and what effect that might have, concedes
that uncertainties over Labour's plans would have most impact on
companies contemplating an overseas investment in Europe for the first
time.
But Professor Hood points out that, increasingly, new inward
investment projects are being generated by companies already established
here expanding. In recent years this has accounted for half reported
cases, he says.
''Given continued world-class performance in Scottish plants within
such networks, it is again difficult to argue that this (constitutional
change) would have an inherently negative effect on reinvestment
patterns.''
The former LiS director warns that the heat and vigour of the
political debate over devolution could have its own impact on future
inwards investment decisions out of proportion to the realities of the
scheme as proposed.
In a marketplace where more and more agencies are competing for a
shrinking pool of investment, Professor Hood points out that the UK
remaining outside moves towards a single European currency would be
regarded by the weight of international business opinion as undesirable.
''The scale of uncertainty surrounding the UK's position on this issue
far outweighs that associated with devolution,'' he writes.
Meanwhile, Mr Blair, in Glasgow as part of his campaign to win party
activists over to the scrapping of Clause 4 and the drafting of modern
aims and values for Labour, lashed out at the Tory ''lie machine'' which
had put a 20p income tax price on Scottish self-determination,
describing the threat as the politics of retribution.
Mr Blair lambasted Ministers for their threats to punish Scots
financially if a Parliament in Edinburgh is created.
He said these attacks came ''straight from the Tory lie machine,''
adding: ''It is simply absurd to suggest that devolution would result in
a 20p tax rise. In the UK resources are pooled at the centre and then
distributed according to need.
''That is what dictates Scotland's level of public expenditure now,
and the same principle will apply when devolution is in place. There is
absolutely no reason why this should change.
''Mr Clarke's remarks are nothing more than the politics of
retribution. He is threatening the people of Scotland with a revenge
raid on their budget if they dare to try to change the way the country
is governed.''
On the new statement of values for Labour, he said the reform of
Clause 4 was ''a defining moment in the history of our party.''
He added: ''We replace the old commitment to take into common
ownership the whole economy with the aim of a dynamic economy where
public and private sectors exist side by side and where each and every
person should have the opportunity to work and prosper.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, speaking at a conference in Kirkintilloch
yesterday, said Labour's devolution plans would weaken local government
and centralise functions in Edinburgh.
He said single-tier councils would ''remove the waste, bureaucracy,
duplication and confusion of the present two-tier system.'' Labour plans
would ''plunder those powers and weaken local government''.

Exclusive
From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington
THE United States wants the United Nations to sharply increase its
sanctions against Libya for its continued refusal to hand over the two
suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.
The US now wants a complete oil embargo, making it illegal to buy oil
from Libya. Sanctions were imposed by the UN three years ago, and so far
have had no effect. They are a ban on air travel to or from Libya and
various financial restrictions. The Americans think it is time to impose
stricter and more painful penalties.
The two suspects are Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah. They have both been indicted here and in Edinburgh.
They are alleged to be agents of the Libyan intelligence service who
worked under cover in Malta in 1988 and are said to have put a suitcase
with a bomb in it, concealed in a radio, aboard a flight out of Malta.
The suitcase is alleged to have been put aboard an Air Malta flight to
Frankfurt and transferred to PanAm flight 103A to London. It is then
said to have been transferred a second time to PanAm's regular flight
103, London/New York on December 21, 1988.
The plane exploded over Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and
11 more on the ground.
In April, 1993, the Security Council, in a bid to persuade Libya to
hand the men over, imposed a first round of sanctions.
The sanctions are due for renewal at the end of this month. They have
not worked. The United States believes that further action is required,
and is suggesting to its European allies, starting with the British and
French, that an oil embargo should be decreed.
If that proves too difficult to impose, other, lesser sanctions would
be discussed. A group of senators, including members of the foreign
relations committee and Senator Edward Kennedy, are issuing a statement
today calling for stricter sanctions. They will be writing to the UN and
to other governments, including London and Paris, urging the case.
The US move came as the Leader of the House of Commons, Mr Tony Newton
told Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, in a letter yesterday
that it was out of the question for the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of
Earlsferry, to make a statement to either the House of Lords or the
Scottish Grand Committee about the evidence in the Lockerbie bombing
case.
He said Lockerbie was no different from any other criminal case and
details of evidence could not be disclosed while proceedings are
pending.
In a letter to the MP accompanying a formal Commons written reply, Mr
Newton said: ''The appropriate forum for disclosure and testing of
evidence available against the accused in such a criminal case is the
High Court of Justiciary during the trial of the persons who are accused
of that crime.''

A WEB of misinformation surrounding the death of prominent Scottish
Nationalist Willie McRae has been uncovered by The Herald.
The time of Mr McRae's death, the distance from his body of the gun
used to kill him, and even the location of the incident, are among a
series of conflicts between official statements and the facts.
The new revelations follow disclosures in The Herald yesterday that
bungling by authorities at several levels may have helped to cover up
the circumstances surrounding Mr McRae's death.
''Vital information has been withheld from the public while, at the
same time, misinformaton and disinformation has been spread to the media
concerning Willie McRae,'' claims the Celtic League, a cultural and
environmental pressure group.
The muddying of facts begins with the distance that Mr McRae's car was
found from the A87 at Loch Loyne on the morning of Saturday April 6,
1985, by a passing Australian tourist.
Mr McRae's body was found in the driving seat, the apparent victim of
a road accident.
It was many hours later when he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary that a nurse discovered a gunshot wound in his right temple.
A 48-hour police inquiry led the procurator-fiscal in Inverness to
state that there were no suspicious circumstances and the
Solicitor-General, Mr Peter Fraser, ruling against a fatal accident
inquiry.
Initially the police told the press that Mr McRae's Volvo 244 was
found straddling a small burn 70 yards from the road.
However, documents now show it was 87ft from the carriageway.
This confusion leads to an apparently deliberate attempt to mask the
identity of the policeman who was the first to arrive of the scene and
who 24 hours later discovered the gun used in the shooting.
For 10 years the press have been fed the name of local police
constable Findlay MacBeath as the ''man of the scene''.
But not only was PC MacBeath on late shift that weekend, his sergeant
in Fort Augustus, Mr Willie Paterson, was on holiday and colleague Iain
Morrison had been given the weekend off.
While the policemen who knew the ''patch'' were all on leave, rookie
constable Kenny Crawford, on relief duty from Inverness, was left to
find the locus and deal with it single-handedly.
When contacted by The Herald Mr Crawford admitted that the pistol
which killed Mr McRae was found some yards from the victim's body.
This confirmed earlier uncorroborated reports but conflicted with
recent statements by Mr Fraser -- now Lord Fraser of Carmyllie -- that
the gun was found directly under where the car had been discovered.
Mr Fraser had earlier admitted that the weapon was found ''further
away than it would have been if it had just fallen from his grasp''.
The location of the gun is a crucial indicator as to whether Mr McRae
was murdered or committed suicide. The exact location of the car may
also prove crucial.
The Crown says the site of the crash can be found on Ordnance Survey
sheet 34 at a grid reference 21 95 80 66. Yet this site is a mile
south-west of Spean Bridge in a field off the A82 and some 20 miles from
Loch Loyne.
Not withstanding the eight-figure reference the actual point of the
incident is closer to a reference of: 19 50 68.
The 10 years since Mr McRae's death has also seen a perpetration of
misinformation surrounding the identity of the garage mechanic who
retrieved the maroon Volvo from the hillside.
The Herald tracked down Mr John MacDonald, of West End Garage, Fort
Augustus. Mr MacDonald confirmed the location of Mr McRae's car at the
grid reference we ascribe and ''much further than 87ft from the road''.
Even the time of death, given on Mr McRae's death certificate as
3.30am on Sunday April 7, 1985 is now challenged by new information
which claims the time as being 3.30pm -- some 39 hours after the
shooting.
Yesterday's exclusive revelations that Mr McRae may have been carrying
secret documents relating to the Dounreay nuclear facility at the time
of his death, may yet provide the key.
Late last week Mr David Mclean, MP, a Home Office Minister, announced
that MI5 and MI6 are to be given access to criminal records on the
police national computer.
If the Association of Chief Police Officers agrees to the move, the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) will also be given access
to this privileged information. The UKAEA manages Dounreay.
''One of the policies of MI5 in all these matters is to muddy the
waters as much as possible so that no-one can see the bottom of the
pond,'' explained Mr John Conway, a former member of the Northern
Constabulary in an interview with The Herald in 1990.
Mr Conway unofficially investigated the McRae case following his
retirement from the force and has claimed there was a conspiracy at the
highest level to cover up the circumstances surrounding the death.
Shortly after Mr Conway went on the record he was was run over by a
motor cycle, incurring hideous injuries. He is convinced this was a
''frightener'' which went wrong.

A MAN died last night after a shooting incident in Glasgow's South
Nitshill area. He was taken to hospital after being found in Glenlora
Drive, but died later as a result of his injuries.
Strathclyde Police sealed off neighbouring streets and drafted in dog
teams and the force helicopter to help search for his attacker.
Groups of alarmed residents were drawn outside by the police activity,
which included the use of search lights near the Pollok shopping centre.
Mr James Dunwoodie, who lives opposite the scene of the shooting,
said: ''We were watching television at about quarter to ten when we
heard what appeared to be the sound of two shots. We looked out and saw
a man get out of a Fiesta shouting: ''Help me, help me, I've been
shot.''
Late last night police had not made any arrests.
