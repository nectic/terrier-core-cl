HIGHLAND LEAGUE
NAIRN County conjured up a football miracle to match a summer full of
financial wonders as the Highland League season kicked off on Saturday.
Just weeks after bouncing back from the brink of bankruptcy, they
produced a surprise 3-0 win against ambitious Buckie, repaying some of
the #55,000 cash raised by fans with a dazzling display away from home.
Only the hardest of hearts would have grudged the amateurs a win after
managing only three in 30 games last season.
County led 1-0 at the break through Davidson, with two goals in four
minutes from MacMillan and Sharp sinking Buckie early in the second
half.
Jubilant chairman Ron Mackenzie later praised his men: ''They proved
all the hard work has been worthwhile. It was the perfect way to repay
the public.
''I'm very proud that a team of amateurs can turn on a show like that
against semi-professionals,'' he added.
The Save County campaign is now set to receive another boost in the
shape of a #15,000 district council loan.
Champions Huntly picked up where they left off with a 3-0 win at home
to Forres. Gary Whyte and Craig Yeats (2) were the scorers.
Cove Rangers beat Brora 2-1, Fraserburgh thrashed Elgin 6-2, and Clach
were unlucky to go down 2-1 to Peterhead.

Gary Buchanan takes a memorable railway journey
SINCE its inaugural run in May 1985, the world's most luxurious train
has captured the imagination of Scots who know a thing or two about
travelling in style and has set new standards in luxury railway travel.
Celebrating its tenth anniversary year, the Royal Scotsman, owned and
operated by The Great Scottish and Western Railway Company, will be
visiting historic British cities and little used scenic railway lines.
Two night, three day journeys from Edinburgh take in the dramatic east
coast, past Berwick-on-Tweed and Northumbrian vistas stretching to the
part-time island of Lindisfarne. The historic town of Alnwick was built
to bar the eastern road into England against the Scots.
As the train continues south past the Norman cathedral at Durham,
standing sentinel over this ancient city, passengers congregate in the
elegant surroundings of the observation car. Clinking glasses of single
malts provide a fitting tribute to sublime comfort.
Morning visits to Fairfax House and the Minster precede the train's
departure from York. As the Royal Scotsmen and women settle down for a
well-balanced lunch, this ''magic carpet on 72 wheels'' heads southwest
towards Cheltenham and Bath. At Frome guests visit Stourhead house and
gardens before returning to the train at Cranmore Station on the
restored East Somerset Line, where dinner is served in an informal
setting.
The next day, that apotheosis of the romantic age of railway grandeur,
the steam locomotive is fuelled and watered for the journey eastwards
towards London.
As the wheezing dinosaur gathers speed, passengers reflect on this
railway odyssey, not so much a land cruise across Britain, more a
journey back in time, glimpsing another, more gracious, era.
If arriving in Scotland on board ''the sybaritic special'' is your
idea of the golden age of travel, where pace gives way to grace, then
the three day northbound return to romance could be just the ticket.
Charlecote Park is the first stop before overnighting in Shakespeare
country at Henley-in-Arden. A visit to Castle Howard, setting for
Brideshead Revisited, is on the itinerary the following day. After lunch
en route to Keighley, guests tour the Bronte Parsonage at Haworth. The
rugged countryside and wild landscapes that surround this quaint village
with its narrow cobbled main street were the inspiration for Jane Eyre
and Wuthering Heights.
The journey's highlight must surely be travelling on the scenic Settle
to Carlisle line in such opulence. Reaching 1350ft at Ais Gill, this is
England's highest main line railway summit. A series of viaducts and
tunnels are a tribute to Victorian engineering that conquered this wild,
spectacular terrain. Stirling is the setting for the formal dinner on
the final night. High above, the cragtop castle -- that monument to
human contentiousness that outdoes every other castle in Scotland --
reaffirms any doubt in the travellers' minds that they are indeed in the
historic and geographical heart of Scotland.
While Waverley Station may be the terminus for the journey from
London, it is the starting point for the five day tours throughout some
of Scotland's best scenery, visiting its grandest mansions.
The highland fling aboard The Royal Scotsman visits the century-old
West Highland Line, the Spey Valley, Skye and the North East during its
spectacular, stately, sojourn in Scotland.
Offering the most stylish accommodations to be found within the limits
imposed by British railway carriages, the staterooms of the Royal
Scotsman are well planned to provide comfort and space.
As Robert Louis Stevenson once said, ''I travel for travel's sake, the
great affair is to move,'' nowhere could this great Scot's paean to
motion be more apt than describing a journey around Britain on board The
Royal Scotsman.

THE interim reporting season continues this week with a number of
leading companies unveiling their wares including British Airways, BOC,
and Barclays.
British Airways kicks off today with its first quarter figures to
June. Profits will be boosted by strong passenger demand across the
network with many planes flying at full capacity. The airline says its
scheduled traffic in the three months to end-June was up 11.9% on an
increase in capacity of 5.5% to produce an average load factor of 73.5%,
its highest ever in a first quarter.
There has been some deterioration in average fares paid so far this
year because much of the growth is coming on long-haul routes where
average fares per kilometre flown -- the so-called yield -- are lower
than for short-haul.
However, unit costs are also lower on long-haul flights and BA says
long-haul routes account for most of the group's profit. Analysts are
looking for profits of up to #115m against #86m last time.
Hot on the heels of Shell's quarterly figures, BP will tommorrow
reveal its first quarter profits to end June. Kleinwort Benson analysts
reckon the oil giant will report excellent trading for the quarter with
net income likely to jump to #520m or more from #335m in the
corresponding period last year, helped by a firmer oil price.
However, as with Shell, BP is thought likely to warn of weakening oil
prices which will affect earnings in the remainder of the year.
Barclays also declares its hand tommorrow, continuing the banks'
interim reporting season. Securities house UBS has pencilled in pre-tax
profits of #1039m for the first six months of the year, almost unchanged
from the the first half in 1994 when it made #1036m. The modestly
improved profits will be largely due to lower bad debt provisions and
UBS reckons there will be no increase in underlying profits.
Commercial Union is on course for a major leap in half-year earnings
when it reports on Wednesday, according to Hoare Govett. A marked
absence of losses from US weather related claims are thought to have
helped pre-tax profits soar to #247m from #181m in the first six months
of last year.
Analysts will also be keen to see the extent of the contribution from
its French subsidiary, Groupe Victoire. The half-year dividend payout is
thought likely to rise from 10.1p to 10.7p. Royal Insurance follows up
on Thursday and analysts' expectations range from #220m to #250m against
#191m previously. An interim dividend of 4.6p to 5p is expected, up from
4p.
On Wednesday, Standard Chartered is likely to reflect its tight
control of costs, falling provisions, and improving levels of income.
Pre-tax profits could emerge at #284m for the six months to the end of
June against #237m for the same period last year.
Strong demand for industrial gases is believed to be the biggest
driver of profits in BOC Group's third quarter. UBS is expecting profits
to rise by #10m to #100m with gases the best performer, helped by price
increases in America. Its healthcare division, although ahead of last
year, is still affected by competition. A similar story is true of its
distribution operation although its vacuum business is doing well,
reckons UBS.
The car parts and Westland Helicopter group GKN should report
''excellent'' half-year results on Thursday, according to NatWest.
Taxable profits for the six months to the end of June are likely to have
raced ahead to #138.5m from #97.3m in the corresponding period last
year.
Analysts will be looking for evidence that profit margins on the
substantial car parts business can reach double digits and that Westland
can approach a double figure operating margin.
Any suggestion that weak US car sales in the absence of a significant
recovery in European car sales will slow the group in the second half
would be bad news. The interim dividend could be hiked from 8p to 8.8p.

'It seems extraordinary that opening an account with Hambros can
result in large overdrafts being created without the knowledge or
understanding of those concerned'
MP Brian Wilson
THE future of the Glasgow-based equities operation of Hambros bank
hangs in the balance after the disclosure of losses at its securities
clearing business.
In the financial year to March, Hambro Clearing lost #3.9m, much of
which related to the equity settlement service. The losses stem from
dealings with south London financial advisor Financial Management
International, (FMI). The financial industry regulators forced FMI to
stop trading last January and closed it down in May.
FMI is alleged to have arranged for shares to be bought and sold
without clients' knowledge or authority. Some clients did not realise
they had signed forms enabling Hambros to open overdrafts in their names
to fund the share deals.
Because many of these overdrafts remain unsettled, Hambros has decided
to sue about 50 of the 5000 investors to recover over #1m. Some
investors are being asked for more than #25,000.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman Mr Brian Wilson has called for
an investigation into the heavy losses suffered by the small investors
and the actions of Hambros Bank.
Mr Wilson said: ''The essential fact is that Hambros' clients were
blissfully unaware of the losses being run up on their accounts as a
result of the dealings of a company called FMI, who were acting under
the authority of the bank.''
He added that, although investors had an obligation to read the small
print, they were also entitled to expect reasonable protection from the
regulatory system. ''It seems extraordinary that opening an account with
Hambros can result in large overdrafts being created without the
knowledge or understanding of those concerned,'' he said.
As a result of the equity settlement losses, it is thought inevitable
that the Glasgow-based equities operation will close and that buyers
will be sought for Hambros' derivatives and bonds settlement business.
The equity settlement service was withdrawn on May 12. The trading
losses will be charged to the profit and loss account for the year
ending March 31, 1996, as will associated goodwill previously written
off directly to the reserves of around #2.5m.
No-one from Hambros bank was available for comment yesterday.

YOUR picture with the article headed ''View of a city in despair'' was
taken in January 1947, 17 months after the atom bomb exploded on
Hiroshima, and shows the city after most of the devastation had been
cleared.
The roads are visible, the rubble has gone, and the fine steel-framed
buildings which were gutted and charred but largely withstood the heat
and blast have been repaired and cleaned. Small utility buildings have
been erected.
What you are seeing is a ''City rising from the ashes''. Far from the
people ''looking miserable and walking about'' they had by then laid the
foundation of rebuilding their city into the beautiful city of today.
And rebuilding their country into an economic superpower.
I was among the first Commonwealth troops to land in Japan in January
1946 at Kure, the giant naval base, with Hiroshima nearby in the
Commonwealth Zone of occupation.
I walked the rubble-cluttered streets of Hiroshima a full 12 months
before the photo was taken. I experienced the smell of death hanging
over the city, I saw bottles turned into puddles of molten glass, and
negatives of humans and animals printed into the road tar by the flash
which vaporised them.
I saw many people carrying horrible injuries and burns, but I never
saw despair. What I did see was resignation and determination.
Having fought against the Japanese in Burma I knew their record of
barbarism and inhumanity -- their war crimes. In defeat, after
reconciling to the shame of it, they showed the other side of their
nature. They became gentle and cultured people. The ruthlessness they
had shown in war was rapidly channelled into reconstruction and
business.
Did the bomb have to be dropped? Yes it did. When we docked at Kure we
were cheered by many young kamikaze pilots for whom our arrival was a
life-saver. Lined up by the hundred on gantries like wine bottles were
one-man midget submarines ready to decimate any invasion fleet.
The bomb took lives but it saved the many more who would have died on
both sides in the slaughter which would have followed an invasion.

A THIN diet of economic news this week is potentially significant and
there will be a further episode in the running dispute on interest rates
between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie
George.
The minutes of their meeting on July 5 will be published on Wednesday.
This was the first of two held last month, neither of which resulted in
a rate rise with the Chancellor again rebuffing the Governor's demands.
Last week, the Bank of England made it clear it still thought it
necessary for rates to increase to bring inflation back to its target of
2.5% or less by the end of the current Parliament. However, the
Chancellor is more concerned about the slowdown in economic activity
which even the Bank admitted had occurred when it published its
quarterly inflation report.
Industrial production and its manufacturing component have shown
little improvement in recent months after the hectic growth of last
year.
James Capel's Mr Adam Cole is expecting a bounceback when the June
figures are published tomorrow and possibly some upward revision to
earlier lacklustre figures. He is forecasting a 0.5% increase in both
industrial production and manufacturing output. This would take the
year-on-year growth in industrial production up from 1.3% in May to
2.3%. Manufacturing would rise from 1.4% in May to 2.2%.
Mr Cole is more bullish than the City consensus and points out the
Central Statistical Office said industrial production had made a modest
contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter.

I MUST take issue with a little bit of your leading article on the
KPMG ferry report in which you suggest that ''P &amp; O get a bigger subsidy
than Cal-Mac for running only four ships against Cal-Mac's 32'' and that
people in the Northern Isles want Cal-Mac to run their service (August
3).
First, unlike Cal-Mac, P &amp; O has to pay for its own ships without
Government support, so there is no subsidy on the expensive capital side
with the provision of vessels.
As a result the Northern Isles ships such as the St Clair and the St
Sunniva are second-hand vessels which have been converted for the job as
distinct from the purpose-built Cal-Mac boats which receive subsidy in
the construction phase as well as deficit funding.
In addition, your remarks do not compare like with like elsewhere. The
Northern Isles routes are longer and less sheltered than those sailed by
Cal-Mac -- at around 290 miles the 14-hour Aberdeen-Lerwick run is more
than twice the length of any Western Isles route and would obviously
require bigger ships and subsidies.
People here do not necessarily want Cal-Mac to run their services but
they are envious of the financial regime under which that company
flourishes and wish it could apply here.
Meanwhile there are worries about the replacement costs of the boats
which provide our road to the south, our freight subsidy has been axed,
and ways of minimising passenger subsidy, for what is an extremely
expensive journey, are being considered.

THE recent extensive coverage in The Herald of the 50th anniversary of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki will no doubt provoke a wide range of responses
from your readers. There is, however, one inescapable fact that must be
confronted by all those who attempt to justify the use of the atomic
bomb on these cities.
There is absolutely no justification for their commonly-held
supposition that the opponents of the use of the bomb are an
unrepresentative minority of politically partisan pacifists, lefties,
etc.
In Volume VI of his History of the Second World War, Winston Churchill
wrote: ''It would be a mistake to suppose that the fate of Japan was
settled by the atomic bomb. Her defeat was certain before the first bomb
fell and was brought about by overwhelming maritime power.''
Likewise, Field Marshal Montgomery of Alamein wrote in his History of
Warfare: ''In my view, it was unnecessary to drop the two atomic bombs
on Japan in August, 1945. And I cannot think it was right to do so . . .
the dropping of the bombs was a major political blunder and is a prime
example of the declining standards of the conduct of modern war.''
General Eisenhower himself said: ''Japan was at that very moment
seeking some way to surrender with minimum loss of face. It wasn't
necesary to hit them with that awful thing.''
CND is not alone in remaining unyieldingly loyal to the concept that
there is no such thing as a just war that does not respect the vital
principle of non-combatant immunity. There are rules in war. You may not
torture, rape, execute surrendered prisoners of war or wilfully
slaughter innocent civilians.
These are clearly the convictions of Truman's Chief of Staff, Admiral
Leahy, who writes: ''It is my opinion that the use of the barbarous
weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our
war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to
surrender because of the effective blockade and the successful bombing
with conventional weapons . . .
''In being the first to use it, we adopted an ethical standard common
to the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in this fashion, and wars
cannot be won by destroying women and children.''

THE Govermment's proposals to impose toll charges on all motorways
fill me with horror. Vehicle users already pay through the nose by means
of fuel tax, vehicle excise licence, and an insurance levy, as well as
considerable VAT revenue.
Scotland additionally has the dubious honour of having a road bridge
where a private company benefits from the extortionate toll charges. I
hope that the Skye economy does not suffer too much because of the
privatised bridge.
In Japan it is difficult to drive more than a few miles without being
milked at a toll barrier. As well as the inevitable delays which are
caused, charges are very steep.
There is a simple reason for this. Some years ago the Japanese
government thought it was a good idea to pay for their road system by
joint ventures with construction companies, allowing the contractor to
collect and keep the toll income. The result has been chaotic and
extremely unpopular.
We should be very wary, for it could easily happen here.

BEING a practical engineer, I am used to a regime which solves the
problems within constraints and resources available -- and I am amazed
that the only solution to the ''problem'' of getting to Glasgow Airport
is purported to be ''build more roads''.
I have had work on which involved Johnstone men working in Airdrie and
vice versa, and the only times we found a problem was when the journey
clashed with an hour or so in the morning or evening which tangled with
the time when every vehicle seemed to want to use three of the five
lanes over the Kingston Bridge.
Presumably the businessmen who find this a problem can plan
sufficiently to select a journey time which allows transit through
Glasgow in the 10 minutes or less which it takes for almost 90% of the
day.
The other solution could be even more consistent -- catch one of the
two trains per hour from Stirling or Edinburgh into Glasgow Queen Street
(40-50 minutes), and walk (four to six minutes) to catch one of the
eight trains an hour to Paisley (eight-12 minutes), and catch a bus
(every 10 minutes) to the airport.
If this seems to have too many changes an equally stress-free journey
(on which useful reading can be done) is to get the direct Citylink bus
-- even this saves the time taken to park at the airport.
Reading recent literature (Chambers of Commerce Directory, I think) no
mention is made of the dedicated shuttle bus between Paisley and the
airport, or through ticketing available -- so potential customers are
bound to be put off using the train.
With a little careful husbandry and small investment a through train
option to Paisley is not beyond the bounds of possibility, bringing the
Edinburgh/Stirling-Paisley time to little over an hour -- consistently
-- and we should press for the direct rail link as the ultimate
time-saver.
The TGWU has bewailed the effects of continual exposure to traffic
fumes on professional divers, and HM Government asks us nicely, but
rather naively, not to use our cars -- please (August 1).
We are lucky in Scotland to have service levels on bus and rail to
achieve this, with a little self-discipline, and forethought.
So next time you go on to autopilot: stop, put the car keys back in
your pocket, and give up 80 square feet of road for four square feet of
public transport.

ALISON KERR says Penguin Books launched their children's equivalent,
Puffins, in the 1950s (July 28). In my bookcase there are two battered
old favourites first printed in the Puffin series in November, 1942.
My survivors are among the many reprinted Puffins of 1945 brought out
no doubt when the wartime paper shortage started to ease.
Avid young readers of that time remember saving pocket money for the
next eagerly-awaited Puffin to reach the bookshops -- priced one
shilling (5p)!

THE new CalMac ferry costing #15.5m has been paid for directly or
indirectly by UK taxpayers to ply on a service between Ullapool and
Stornoway which is also subsidised by UK taxpayers.
If the islanders of Lewis impose restrictions on the operation of the
ferry, which reduce its earning capacity, the shortfall should be
compensated for by higher fares to and from Lewis, and not by greater
subsidies from UK taxpayers.
In a growing multi-faith society the susceptibilities of all faiths
must be given parity of observance. If ferries do not ply on Sundays to
avoid offence to Christians then it follows that they must not ply on
any other days that give offence to Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs,
Buddhists, Parsees, and all other worthy religions, cults, and sects.
The adage ''Paddle your own canoe'' will take on new meaning.

The Crown Estates are represented on The West Highland Sea Trout and

JOHN BEATTIE has drawn attention to the movement of players from
Glasgow rugby clubs to play the better quality of rugby supposedly
available at first-division clubs in Edinburgh and the Borders.
I had thought that the daft arrangements now being made for club rugby
-- the new premier league will be over by the end of November and 40% of
the total league programme will be completed in September, not to
mention mid-week and Sunday fixtures -- were to accommodate an expanded
inter-district tournament with the higher quality of competition that it
would provide.
There is no need for a player to change club to play district rugby.
Indeed the opposite is the case. Who in his right mind would travel from
Glasgow to Edinburgh three or four times a week to train and play for a
club of convenience when he could play district rugby for Glasgow?
The Glasgow rugby authorities could reinforce this argument by
adjusting the eligibility rules. If they were to insist that a player
could only represent Glasgow if he was a current playing member of a
Glasgow club, then the movement of players would be markedly reduced. An
incentive would then exist for members of Glasgow clubs which is missing
if ''emigrants'' are eligible.
When a player who had changed clubs found that he could not play for
Glasgow and that the incumbent in his position in the team of his
adopted district was likely to retain his place, would be not have
second thoughts, even an attack of loyalty to his old club?
The current lax rules on district representation were drawn up to
provide additional playing strength to the North &amp; Midlands before
Stirling County became a power in the land. If Stirling were
re-allocated from the Glasgow district to the North &amp; Midlands, where
geographically it belongs, the rules could be tightened without
significantly affecting the relative strengths of the district sides.
There is another point to consider. Glasgow District Council has in
the past few years begun to provide very welcome finance to promote
Glasgow rugby, particularly at representative and junior levels.
Organisation of the visits of the All Blacks and the Springboks in the
last two seasons benefited quite significantly from the council's
interest and assistance.
The district council would surely not be happy to continue support of
the Glasgow rugby authorities if the so-called Glasgow representative
side contained few if any of the players whom the council is helping to
develop.
In this era when money so obviously talks, perhaps Glasgow District
Council should make its views known in the appropriate quarters.

CONRAD WILSON is correct to say that the seafood on offer in Tobermory
is limited (July 29).
He has got it wrong, however, with his general impression that, Sicily
excepted, you seldom eat well on islands.
There is good news awaiting him if he cares to take a trip to Guernsey
where he will encounter an abundance of excellent restaurants serving a
great variety of freshly caught seafood.

I OBSERVED a kingfisher on the River Clyde near Bothwell Castle in
1977. I did not see kingfishers there again until last summer when a
pair rested downstream of the 1977 sighting (August 2).
I was delighted to observe their return to the same nest site this
spring despite the winter's flooding during which the tree above the
nest site became festooned with polythene and other effluent.
In recent years I have also observed kingfishers in Strathclyde County
Park and the Clyde near Covehouse, and suspect that their numbers are
increasing.
I gather that some members of the Glasgow Natural History Society have
seen kingfishers on the Kelvin.

AS this unbelievably glorious summer goes shining and sizzling its way
towards the record books, what a joy it has been to predict the next few
days with such confidence as to plan those outdoor meals in the sure and
certain knowledge that all will be well.
That was a privilege which once belonged exclusively, it seemed, to
Californians and other ungrateful breeds in an ill-divided world who
could foretell their weather with certainty and take it all for granted.
For whatever reason, however, the gods have decided to give us a break
in these northern climes and the scientists are beginning to believe
that this might be the pattern for the future.
After all, before the great land mass broke up and Britain drifted
north, this Scotland of ours used to sit plumb and pretty on the
equator. That was a bit before our own day but I reckon it is not too
soon that a modicum of justice has been restored.
Of course there are those who will continue to moan about global
warming and greenhouse effects and seek to scare the wits out of us with
bleak forebodings about the ozone layer being ripped apart. In painting
a picture of the whole human race being frizzled to a frazzle, they
don't tell us that that protective layer is also self-repairing and that
life on earth is unlikely to end that way.
So let us enjoy our new-found warmth, so well established from June
through to August that we even had the luxury this weekend of welcoming
the promise of slightly cooler weather. When have you ever heard that
before?
In comparing this year with any other, we are reminded that, even with
longer-term forecasting, a good summer does not announce itself too far
in advance. It happens day by day -- and gradually it begins to dawn
that this might be the best you have known.
Already I am comparing 1995 with the best summer of my own lifetime,
which was 1947. Now there was an interesting case. That hottest of all
my summers came hard on the heels of the worst winter, which blew upon
our Buchan landscape on January 28, 1947, with such ferocity that the
snow blocked roads and railways for weeks on end and could still be
found along dykesides on the very last day of May.
And then it changed as if with the sudden sweep of a miracle. The
first day of June came with such a burst of sunshine that we were out in
gluttonous pursuit of that heat so craved by our pale and sun-starved
bodies.
We ran to the Pleasure Park and played football and sweated and rested
and played again all day till I finally dropped, exhausted, and lay till
the cool evening brought a strange quiver over my young limbs.
Next morning I was found to be with pneumonia -- and just as that
memorable day of heat was to herald the greatest of twentieth-century
summers, I would be confined to bed in a weak and pale condition. Though
the lungs had cleared by the end of June, a specialist was now called
from Aberdeen to investigate a complication.
Professor Craig spoke in quiet, serious tones and said I was ''a very
tired boy''. Some damage had come to the heart and I would have to rest
for a long time.
So they gave me a camp bed on the front green and I viewed that
magnificent summer from the shade of a garden shelter, with much time to
contemplate a bleak future and bite my lip over the professor's advice
to put that dream of journalism well out of sight.
But nature is a skeely worker. And I had youth and determination on my
side. As those cardiac cracks began to heal, that glorious summer of
1947 proved to be the run-up towards the career of which I had dreamed.
Through the good graces of the Turriff Advertiser, I made it after all.
With a new-found enthusiasm and zest for living, I was outward bound on
this great adventure.
And now, 48 years later, when that career is running towards the home
straight, I am contemplating those concluding months in the warmth of a
summer so reminiscent of 1947.
This time, on the way home from the office in Glasgow, I now collect a
tub of Netherlee's famous ice cream and a bottle of wine and eat salads
in the back garden with neighbours, drooling over the wonder of yet
another magnificent night. We even managed to plan an alfresco family
birthday party the other evening, in the certain knowledge of perfect
weather.
As my thoughts strayed once again to 1947, I was counting my blessings
in the years between. One of the main consolations is that, despite the
passing of time, I am so much fitter at the tail end of my career than I
was at the beginning.
Bronzed and relaxed these evenings, I have watched the sun creeping
down upon the horizon, knowing in my heart that every day has been a
bonus and that I am left now with a warm glow of satisfaction which will
surely see us through the worst of winter's woes.

THE David Lloyd Leisure group is expected to announce within the next
few days that it is being taken over, with brewers Whitbread favourite
to buy the business for as much as #180m.
Mr David Lloyd, 46, the former Davis Cup tennis player and present
captain, stands to make about #16m from his 8.5% stake.
Whitbread, which runs a number of health clubs in its Country Clubs
resort hotels, also owns the restaurant chain Beefeater, TGI Friday's,
Brewer's Fayre, and Pizza Hut. Rank Organisation has also been mentioned
as a possible suitor.
DLL runs 13 leisure clubs, including one on a 15-acre site at Renfrew,
near Glasgow. The cost of developing a full tennis and fitness club is
typically around #6m. Sizeable amounts of capital would be needed to
develop the business and Whitbread would be better able to access these
large sums.
Last year, a full contribution from the Renfrew club enabled DLL to
report a 35% jump in annual pre-tax profits to #7.6m. Two new clubs are
scheduled to open in the current year with a further six sites on the
drawing board. City analysts estimate that DLL could make profits of #9m
this year with #11.5m pencilled in for 1996.
Shares in DLL surged last week when the company disclosed it was in
talks which might lead to a bid. They ended the week at 341p compared
with a flotation price of 150p in early 1993.

IT IS becoming commonplace to say that Health Secretary Mr Stephen
Dorrell, newly scrubbed, gowned, and ready for action, is popular
because his predecessor was so disliked. This is a delusion, based
largely on metropolitan London's local difficulties with an
over-provision of city hospitals and Mrs Bottomley's decision that some
must be closed. In the bulk of the country Mrs Bottomley was not
detested, although it is true that she was regarded with the deepest
suspicion as the representative of a Government which had imposed
radical changes on the National Health Service, not all of which appear
to help either patients or NHS staff. Nor is it possible yet to say if
Mr Dorrell is popular. He is personable, which is not the same thing,
and during his time as a Treasury minister was regularly called upon to
explain Government policies on the economy. The Chancellor's rumpled
looks and manner tended to suggest carelessness, especially on
television, and some of his recent gaffes have emphasised that judgment.
In contrast, Mr Dorrell's baggy-eyed demeanour appeared to be the result
of long hours of hard work.
If, then, Mr Dorrell is judged to be popular and effective, why should
this be so? His brief residence at the National Heritage Department was
not in the least effective, indeed his grip on the entire brief appeared
tenuous. The clue to his current acceptability could lie in his sensible
avoidance of sounding dogmatic. This is a great advantage in any
politician who can manage it, especially as so few seem able.
Nevertheless Mr Dorrell will be judged on greater things, and it is his
potential as a Health Secretary which must be examined. He does not
appear willing to recant on Mrs Bottomley's decisions. Certainly the
London hospitals earmarked for closure need not expect a reprieve. In a
sense he is doomed to working with Mrs Bottomley's agenda for some time,
whether or not he approves of it fully, and for this reason we will have
difficulty in assessing his worth. A case in point is the announcement
this morning of new plans to protect patients from incompetent doctors.
It is expected that the proposals will include a requirement that
doctors report to their superiors any colleague who appears to be making
mistakes in diagnosis or treatment. This sounds harsh initially, but it
is a form of self-policing which should safeguard patients while
allowing doctors to monitor their own profession. It is not, of course,
a Stephen Dorrell initiative. Neither can Mrs Bottomley claim it,
although the committee responsible began when she was in office. It is
the fruit of work by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, who
is well-remembered in Scotland for his exceptional abilities.
Nevertheless, Mr Dorrell has had the sense to give all the credit for
the proposals to Dr Calman; Mrs Bottomley might have been less
scrupulous.
As Mr Dorrell has not done much yet, we must pay attention to what he
says. By and large this is encouraging. He deliberately emphasises his
commitment to the welfare state and his own belief in the state as a
universal provider of health and education. In recent interviews he has
spoken strongly of the need for the NHS to provide excellent service on
the basis of need rather than ability to pay. This is heartening stuff
and Mr Dorrell's presentational skills give him, as we have noted
already, an advantage over many politicians who appear to recite
policies by rote. However, as this newspaper and others have rarely
tired of pointing out that no amount of presentation can substitute
effectively for bad policy, there is a clear requirement for Mr Dorrell
to go further and to do so quickly. He has an opportunity with the
various threats of industrial action within the NHS, and specifically
the matter of central funding for nurses' pay. It is not true to say
that devolving a percentage of pay to local bodies makes for greater
accountability. In contrast, it fragments needlessly a system which
already works well and encourages the sort of confusion and potentially
debilitating competition which characterises the worst of the current
reforms. Mr Dorrell has an opportunity to soften this approach. If he
takes it he may be seen as genuinely popular and effective.

LOVELY girls, said the taxi driver to the vox pop interviewer, but
it's a lot of money. His response was probably shared by most people
when the battle to save the Three Graces -- the voluptuous group in
white marble by the Italian master sculptor Antonia Canova -- from the
clutches of the Getty collection in California was at its height. The
battle was won and the money -- all #7.6m of it -- was raised. Now we
can judge for ourselves whether it was worth it. From Wednesday the
Three Graces can be seen in all their unclad glory at the National
Gallery of Scotland on the Mound in Edinburgh. It was part of the deal
that because more than #1m was contributed by the Scottish institution,
whose director Timothy Clifford played a leading part in the successful
campaign (plus or minus the odd gaffe about Getty), the group should
shuttle hereafter between London and Edinburgh. And since the nation, in
one way or another, had forked out this considerable sum to prevent the
nubile Graces from emigrating permanently, it's satisfactory that
viewing will be free. Roll up for the peep show, gratis.
It's easy to be flippant, of course, particularly at the expense of
some of the more pompous guardians of our cultural heritage whose
natural home base is pseuds' corner. But there is little doubt that
Canova's romantic masterpiece will be a hugely popular acquisition, and
that it will attract countless people to the National Gallery who, as
the saying goes, may not know much about art but know what they like.
Subtleties may escape many of us, but the sheer beauty and excellence of
the work is as plain to see as the charms of the maidens themselves.
This has been a good summer for our national galleries. The arrival of
the Graces follows the news that a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund
has secured the permanent display of the Penrose collection of
surrealist paintings and drawings at the Gallery of Modern Art, one of
the three major buildings in Edinburgh comprising the national galleries
(the Portrait Gallery is the third). Meanwhile preparations are going
ahead for the interior redesign and reconstruction of the
nineteenth-century Dean Centre -- also in Edinburgh -- to house works by
the eminent contemporary sculptor, the Scot Sir Eduardo Paolozzi. With
so much cause for congratulation in the capital city, might there be
good news to spare for other centres of culture? It's some time since
there has been word of progress on the proposal to site a national
gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow. Now the preferred site for that
project, the post office headquarters in George Square, is officially on
the market. Shall we hear shortly that the National Galleries of
Scotland is prepared to go ahead, and will the purchase price be found?
Does grace extend to Glasgow?

TRAFALGAR House is considering selling its house-building subsidiary,
including the Ideal Homes business, in order to improve the financial
health of the group. In the six months to March, it lost #48.2m and last
week announced that it was no longer interested in bidding for Northern
Electric.
Its house-building division is thought to be worth around #150m based
on analysts' projections of #15m profit this year. Interim results
showed a good improvement on the first half of last year, partly due to
the running down of the expensive land bank. In January, Ideal Homes won
a House-builder of the Year award for the second consecutive year. The
business focuses on providing good quality, affordable homes.
The Trafalgar disclosure follows hot on the heels of Tarmac, Britain's
second biggest house-builder, which announced last week it was
considering a trade sale or flotation of McLean Homes in order to
concentrate on building materials and services.
Other contractors, including Costain, Mowlem, Birse Group, and Lovell,
have sold house-building businesses or announced plans to withdraw from
private sector housing as the market continues to languish in the
doldrums. In June, 16,800 dwelling were started in the UK compared with
19,400 in June 1994. In the last three months, 48,200 dwellings were
started, 15% less than one year ago.

William Russell takes the grand tour of Buckingham Palace, which opens
again to the public today, and finds there's a new shop on the Mall
They're opening the doors at Buckingham Palace,
Christopher Robin went down with Alice
To view what the tourists are paying to see.
'Looks terribly tacky and
vulgar to me,'
Sniffed Alice.
FOR the third year running the Queen has decided to earn an honest
penny by opening her stately home, Buckingham Palace, to the public from
today. Between now and October 1 some 400,000 people, 7000 a day --
which is the most the palace state rooms can cope with -- will see the
glories of Nash and the rather less glorious alterations made by various
members of the House of Windsor to their London residence.
Of the 400,000 tickets 200,000 will be available for people who come
and queue, the remainder have been issued to the travel trade and group
organisers. A ticket costs #8.50 for adults, #6 for over-60s, and #4.50
for under-17s.
Last year 420,000 people visited the palace, bringing in #2.9m and the
target this year is #3m. The money from the summer opening is used for
the restoration of the fire-damaged appartments at Windsor Castle. The
tour remains the same. What is new this year are the souvenirs and a
greatly enlarged gift shop, the final port of call for the visitors, and
a new temporary ticket office sited in Green Park. Visitors are allowed
in every 15 minutes in batches and it takes a little over an hour to do
the palace. How long the tour finally takes depends on how long the
visitors linger at the gift shop.
The tour is confined to the state rooms. The Queen has yet to add any
of the private apartments to the route, although the eagle-eyed visitor
can spot the secret door, concealed behind an enormous gilt mirror and a
marble-topped table in the White Drawing Room, one of the last of the
state rooms on the tour, through which the royal family materialise on
state occasions. It conceals a corridor leading to a room in which they
assemble.
The truth is that the palace is opulent to say the least, but much of
it is hideously over the top and the excessive amount of gilt applied to
the gingerbread begins, after the first few rooms, to pall. But as a
demonstration of the taste of the Windsors it is unequalled, because
every one of them, from George III, who bought it from the Duke of
Buckingham in 1762, to the present day has made a contribution to its
structure.
The tourist enters through the Ambassadors' Entrance and walks
alongside the inner quadrangle concealed behind the familiar facade on
the Mall. It is a huge gravel courtyard in which the royal carriages
assemble, and on to it opens what is known as the Grand Entrance, a kind
of miniature Greek temple.
The route goes up the grand staircase, designed by Nash in 1828-30,
through the Guard Room, notable for a rather fey statue of Prince Albert
dressed up as a Roman soldier and a rather grim one of Queen Victoria as
a bucolic maiden. Then the rooms proper begin. Although they are
colour-coded, the overwhelming impression is of an infinite variety of
reds and even more gold. The first is the Green Drawing Room also
designed by Nash, whose windows open on to the roof over the grand
portico, then comes the Throne Room, a cacophony of crimson, with the
thrones on a dais being those used by the Queen and Prince Philip at the
Coronation.
Then comes the picture gallery which contains some of the royal
Canalettos, a Rubens of St George and the Dragon, and Van Dyck's Charles
I riding with Monsieur de St Antoine and his Charles I with Henrietta
Maria and their two eldest children. At the end is a handsome statue of
Mrs Jordon, mistress to William IV, with two of their children, which
was presented to the Queen in 1975 by the Earl of Munster.
More galleries follow and then comes the State Dining Room, a purple
and red room with a splendid ceiling which looks like the set for
Ruddigore as the walls are lined with family portraits, all clearly
pondering coming to life. Banquets are held here, but not state
banquets. They are held in the ballroom built by Queen Victoria which is
not on the tour. The banquets held here are intimate affairs. The table
groans with some silver gilt tableware, and the walls, where they are
not red, are covered by immense gilt-framed mirrors.
After that come the Blue Drawing Room, the music room, which houses a
rather sad small grand piano and is better known as the place where
royal babies are christened rather than where royals make music. Next is
the White Drawing Room and the tour once again descends to the ground
floor, this time down the Ministers' Staircase built for Queen Victoria
in the 1850s. The Marble Hall, the Bow Room, which is directly beneath
the music room, and the tour is over -- the visitor passes out through
the French windows into the Palace gardens, which have been securely
cordoned off.
The route then heads past the lavatories on to the royal gift shoppe
-- all major credit cards accepted -- housed at the end of a long
pathway which flanks the garden wall. Among the goods on sale are a
crimson and gold commemorative bone china mug, #12; a lead crystal
goblet with a gilt serpent coiled up the stem and round the bowl, #65; a
commemorative bone-china plate to match the mug, #20; and a cup and
saucer in similar style, #25. The designs are copied from designs Nash
used in the staterooms. After-dinner mints, #8; Tudor Rose chocolates,
#5; packs of postcards, #2; and a carriage clock in a limited edition,
#595; are among other goodies specially selected by the Royal Collection
Enterprises.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES:
ONE-DAY cricket's most unlikely result -- a tie -- happening even once
in a season can be regarded as unusual. But for it to happen twice, and
between the same sides, almost defies belief.
Unless, of course, you happened to be at the madhouse which went under
the guise of Williamfield on Saturday. The song about mad dogs and
Englishmen going out in the midday sun had nothing on this.
The car park was the first hint that all was not normal. It was almost
full. A glance out to the not-so-large acres of the Stirling ground saw
two matches in progress -- apparently only the second time this has
happened, with the Torbrex XI and 2nd Clackmannan sides having an East
League encounter.
The roars of ''howzat'' was like the old stuck needle of a gramophone.
No peaceful, sunny afternoon's sport this week. Now to find the Caley
80/- League match between Stirling County and Fifeshire. Thoughts of
Comic Relief came to mind as the home side's players were easily spotted
in the field -- wearing dazzling bright red baseball caps, sporting the
Ferrari logo, courtesy of vice-chairman John Henderson, who had just
returned on Saturday from a holiday in Italy.
The caps might have been handy to stave off the searing heat, but they
certainly did not speed up Stirling's batting. Fifeshire, with the
exception of Wayne Sullivan, who hit a half-century, plodded along until
they were all out for 153 in the forty-ninth over. Sullivan's 50 had
come off 75 balls, with five 4s. Another 4 and a couple more runs later,
he was out for 56. Willie Morton was the pick of the Stirling bowlers
with four for 54.
Step in Stirling. Professional Kyle Wealleans went for 27, and Jon
Taylor for just three short of his half-century. Everything in the
garden still seemed to be as rosy as those baseball caps -- until the
middle order was posted missing, mainly because of a fine spell of
bowling from Keith Graveling and pro Ashok Malhotra. Ker Henderson
seemed to have sparked a revival until he, too, was walking back to the
pavilion, with 41 under his belt.
Stirling required one run off the last ball, but Kenny Wright was run
out for 7 -- with Stirling all out for 153. Graveling had excellent
figures of six for 49, while Ashok recorded three for 57.
There was an amazing match at Lochlands, where Arbroath County took on
league leaders Aberdeenshire -- and the outcome has led to one of the
tightest battles for the league title for years.
Arbroath went in first, and after 50 overs, were 245 for one. Instead
of declaring, however, skipper George Salmond decided to take the extra
four overs to which his side were entitled, and they raced to a mammoth
292 without further loss.
The leaders then decided to shut up shop, and crawl to 100 for two in
the remaining 46 overs -- and they even had two points deducted for a
slow over rate during the Arbroath innings.
For Arbroath, Kevin Ritchie was unbeaten on 163, and Salmond 98 not
out. The Smiths -- Mike and Colin -- were 46 not out and 38
respectively.
It is becoming tighter at the top, and Ayrshire certainly took
advantage to cut the gap in second place when they defeated bottom club
Perthshire by four wickets in another high-scoring game at Prestwick. A
century by Graham Ferguson, plus 87 from Lal Rajput, took the Perth side
to a highly respectable 216 for five, but 84 from Drew Parsons and 58
from David Haggo sent the home team to 217 for six, with Ken McGregor
taking a respectable four for 39.
Malcolm Howell continued his amazing record for Clackmannan -- and yet
again without support from his fellow batsmen. Last week, for example,
he was unbeaten on 72, with Clackmannan all out for 99 up at Mannofield.
At The Arns on Saturday, he was unbeaten on 96 as the Wee County could
muster only 153 for eight against West Lothian.
And even bowling figures of four for 53 by Howell could not stop the
Linlithgow side from reaching 155 for six, with an unbeaten 46 from Alan
Farquharson and a steady 36 from David Fleming.
Forfarshire and Strathmore County put on a knife-edge match which
ended in a draw at Forthill.  Mark Mudie's unbeaten century, helped by
46 from Willie Duthie, helped Strathie to amass 210 for nine. Peter
Drinnen with 66 and John Phillips with 35 were just unable to spur their
side to victory. They finished on 209 for nine. It was that close.

TWO Scottish suppliers to the electronics industry have merged in an
#18.5m deal inspired by the investment capital group 3i. Eraba, a
Livingston based precision engineer employing 120, and Optima
Enclosures, whose 200 workers supply casings to the defence, computer,
and telecommunications industries from a base in East Lothian, become
the Walker Dickson Group.
The merged business will be led by Mr Ken Lewandowski, a Scot who was
previously UK managing director of Avex Electronics, the American
electronic sub-assembly specialist with a plant in East Kilbride.
Mr Lewandowski returns from a more senior post with Avex in its home
state of Alabama to take charge of Walker Dickson. He said the deal
would create a formidable alliance, offering both businesses the
opportunity to grow further.
Eraba was was founded in 1981 by Mr Jim Jamieson, who becomes
production director of the enlarged group. Its focus is precision
engineered components for the electronics and telecoms sectors. 3i was
an investor in Eraba.
Optima dates back from 1961. In 1974, it was acquired by a customer,
Scientific Atlanta, but was subject to a management buy-out in 1986,
again backed by 3i. Its customer base ranges from IBM and Motorola to
Sony and Siemens.
The merger involves #7.5m of equity with Bank of Scotland providing
the debt facilities. Walter Dickson Group was advised by accountants
Rutherford Manson &amp; Dowds and solicitors McGrigor Donald.
The rest of the new management team is Mr Steve Dolton, finance
director, Mr James Webb, sales director, and Mr Allen Standley, chief
executive of Peek as non-executive chairman.

THE FIFTH TEST:
ENGLAND'S selectors have had to ring the changes again, although it
must be said that most of them are because of injuries.
And that has brought a surprise or two, with the squad of 13 announced
yesterday including Sussex captain Alan Wells who, at 33, has yet to win
a Test cap, the left arm seamer Mark Ilott, and off-spinner Richard
Illingworth.
Although chairman of selectors, Ray Illingworth, and his team would
like to have kept to the axiom of not changing a winning side, they have
had to juggle players around for the vitally important Fifth Test
against West Indies which starts at Trent Bridge on Thursday.
The most significant alteration to the team that won the fourth Test
by six wickets to level the series 2-2 at Old Trafford has been brought
on by the horrific facial injury to Robin Smith, who is out for the
remainder of the summer with a depressed fracture of the cheekbone.
His replacement probably will be Wells who, not unlike Smith, plays
fast bowling better than most of the middle-order batsmen in the
country. He also possesses a cool temperament which is an important
factor when facing as relentless a pace barrage as seen from the West
Indians in this series.
Wells, who was overlooked after the third one-day international at
Lords -- during which he was able to have only a brief slog -- has been
in fine form this season after leading England's A team on a successful
winter tour. With five centuries and two half-centuries, he heads the
averages for his county, Sussex.
Graeme Hick, dropped from the last Test after having beenincluded in
the squad, is back again in the 13. The season has not gone well for
him, and although it was thought that he had improved his weakness
against fast bowling, the old flaws remain. The West Indies has
exploited those areas in his batting, and it showed at Edgbaston.
For Hick, a thirty-sixth cap would represent a truly final chance. But
the same player will still be hoping that he, and not Wells, will be
given Smith's No.5 spot in a Test which England captain Mike Atherton
yesterday predicted will be ''the deciding encounter'' in the six-match
series.
Hick has been dropped four times in five summers by England, but the
odds on his return could be clinched because of his off-spinning second
string, as his so-far fallible batting qualities.
Mark Ilott, the replacement for Darren Gough, adds a new angle to the
attack. His left arm seamers bring a change to the West Indies batsmen,
who will find the ball coming more diagonally and going away from the
right-handers.
In first-class matches this season, he leads Essex's averages with 55
wickets, which includes a brilliant haul of nine for 19.
Veteran off-spinner John Emburey, having been given a one-off Test at
Old Trafford where he was economical but did little else, makes way for
the return of left-arm orthodox Richard Illingworth, now recovered from
the knuckle injury sustained in the Third Test.
Old Tafford's debutantes, opening batsmen Nick Knight and all-rounder
Mike Watkinson, retain their places. Knight, who appeared calm and
composed in the face of hostile bowling during the 155 minutes he spent
at the crease -- he also fielded so well -- and Watkinson, after making
considerable contribution with the ball and the bat, have earned another
chance.
With Alec Stewart's injury still keeping him out, wicket keeper Jack
Russell remains in the side. But the argument is still doing the rounds
that had Stewart been fit, would Russell still have been included?
Certainly his performance at Old Trafford, both behind the stumps and
particularly with the bat during England's jittery final hour, was most
commendable.
On the evidence of his performance in the Fourth Test, all-rounder
Craig White will breathe a sign of relief at being included in the
squad. The selectors would certainly have had names of the experienced
David Capel and the young Ronnie Irani in their minds.
It could be that both Hick and Wells will be in the final 11, with
White and either a seamer or spinner omitted, but England chairman Ray
Illingworth was giving nothing away when he announced the Trent Bridge
squad yesterday morning.
''I think you can say the top order is fixed,'' said Illingworth.
''But the rest of the side is in the melting pot.
While captain Mike Atherton will be concerned a little about his own
flagging form in recent weeks, he'll be looking for runs from Graham
Thorpe again, and John Crawley.
On Trent Bridge's pitch, which is expected to be quicker than Old
Trafford, England will be hoping that Angus Fraser and particularly the
irrepressible Dominic Cork can repeat their efforts.
For the first time in the series, the West Indies are facing injury
problems.
With Carl Hooper ruled out of the Test, and Jimmy Adams out of the
series, opening batsman Stuart Williams and middle order left-hander
Shivnarine Chanderpaul are expected to make their first appearance in
this series.
England squad:
M Atherton, N Knight, J Crawley, G Thorpe, A Wells, C White, R
Russell, D Cork, M Watkinson, M Ilott, A Fraser, G Hick, R Illingworth.

SCU TROPHY
THE new SCU trophy will spend its first winter lodging in the Arbroath
clubhouse after the Lochlands club scored a comfortable victory in the
all county championship final against Fifeshire at neutral Boghall in
Linlithgow yesterday.
Having warmed up on Saturday by carting the bowling of county
championship favourites Aberdeenshire all over the park, Arbroath were
at it again, and hammered 255 for six off the disappointing Fifeshire
attack.
Openers John Salmond and Kevin Ritchie plundered 44 runs in 39 minutes
before Ritchie was bowled by Aslam Raza. In came Scottish captain George
Salmond to produce the innings of the match. If he took his time
initially -- 62 balls for his first 50 -- he was in racing gear
thereafter. His 100 came up after 90 balls, and with 94 runs hammered in
the remaining 14 overs, he was left unbeaten on 127 when the 50 overs
were up.
In his final match for Arbroath before returning to Pakistan, Mohammad
Zahid proved Salmond's most enduring partner, with the pair putting on
129 runs for the fifth wicket in 54 minutes.
Fifeshire were disappointing in the field, although Ross Mitchinson
can be pleased with his caught and bowled to dismiss John Salmond, and
once he had put on the keeper's gloves, Raza made a sharp stumping.
Young Benjy McGill then gave Arbroath the best possible start when he
clean bowled Mitchinson in the second over with Fife on four.
Willie Sullivan joined Raza and the pair saw the score up to 71 when
Raza fell victim to a good catch at extra cover by that man, George
Salmond.
Sullivan was out a run short of his 50, and a century stand for the
fourth wicket followed from Fife pro Ashok Malhotra and Ewan Ogilvie.
This ensured Fife would produce a respectable reply, but it lacked
urgency with the pair failing to pressurise the fielders. Malhotra was
first out, caught behind to a top edge, with the score on 200.
Ogilvie followed five runs later and with the tail end having a swing
the Fife score reached 237 for nine. Arun Trivedi had the best figures
of three for 49 while Zahid, one for 20 off eight overs, was the tidiest
of the Arbroath attack.
SCOTLAND'S preparations for the B clash with Durham County at Stockton
today were thrown into disarray at the weekend when four players called
off.
Out go skipper David Haggo, seamers David Cowan and John Blain, and
experienced batsman Gordon McGurk. In come Donald Orr, Mark Mudie, Jim
Govan and Stuart Moffat.
Coach Jim Love said: ''It's been a nightmare weekend with a mixture of
injuries and work commitments denying us so many players. Even some of
the guys I originally called-in as replacements couldn't make it. At one
time I thought we might not raise a side.''

* ARAVINDA de Silva and Trevor Ward both hit centuries as Kent moved
up to second place in the AXA Equity and Law Sunday League yesterday
with a 55-run victory over Surrey.
Sri Lankan Test star de Silva (124), a centurion in Kent's Benson and
Hedges Cup final defeat by Lancashire, teamed up with opener Ward (123)
in a county record second-wicket stand of 241 to thrill the Canterbury
crowd.
De Silva raced to his century with two 6s and fourteen 4s off just 83
deliveries, while Ward's 102-ball ton included three 6s and eleven 4s.
Kent's final 40-over total of 301 for seven was always too much for
Surrey and, despite skipper Adam Hollioake's defiant 94, Dean Headley's
competition-best return of six for 42 saw the visitors bowled out for
246.
Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram was Lancashire's hero as the Red Rose
county moved up to joint third in the table with Warwickshire following
a 22-run victory over fellow title hopefuls Sussex at Old Trafford.
Akram took four for 16 from seven overs, including the wicket of Surrey
skipper and England hopeful Alan Wells as the visitors were bowled out
for 144 in reply to Lancashire's 40-over total of 166 for eight.
Out-of-form England skipper Mike Atherton (46) top-scored for the home
side, who were grateful for an eighth-wicket stand of 45 between
wicketkeeper Warren Hegg and Gary Yates after they had slipped from 90
for one to 121 for eight.

Theatre
THE Open Air Theatre at Regents Park turned out to be the perfect
setting for a successful revival of Meredith Willson's 1957 hit The
Music Man. Brian Cox stars in his first musical as the eponomous hero.
Ian Talbot's riotously successful production gives Cox plenty of scope
as ''Professor'' Harold Hill, a musical instrument salesman who normally
gets the cash and gets out of town before the good citizens realise that
their children haven't learnt to play a note.
In River City, Iowa, Hill meets his match: the local piano teacher,
Marian (a zesty, touching, beautifully sung performance by Liz
Robertson). Her younger brother Winthrop, traumatised from his father's
recent death, is persuaded by the music man to enlist in the new band
which, miraculously, turns out to be a success. For once Hill stays
behind and literally faces the music.
The wonderful score and book and lyrics is by Meredith Willson, a
former member of Sousa's Band, and it includes at least two
showstoppers: the magical ballad, Till There Was You, and the ultimate
march, 76 Trombones.
The town is peopled with wonderful characters including a formidably
funny mayoress, Veronica Clifford, and her stiffly correct husband, John
Challis. Four deadly enemies are transformed by Hill's magic oratory
into a wondrous barber-shop quartet; among a series of vigorous
enjoyable performances from a talented cast I'd pick out the energetic
Christopher Staines as a good example.
The Music Man is a highly enjoyable summer treat for youngsters of any
age.

Sunny Jim from Para Handy was ever saying, ''It will be good for a
baur.'' A baur, a spot of high jinks, a tirravee, merriment, fun. The
Western Isles man doesn't take himself too seriously, perhaps because he
(and she) has to take life very seriously indeed, for in the landscape
where the land is so barren that the only things you can grow are
stones, life and the survival of it is very serious indeed.
In a climate which can be harsh enough for any penitent, life needs
lifting a touch. And in a place so poetic, so sad, so touchingly tragic,
so historic, and so tearfully beautiful as Eriskay, you need the high
jinks. Thus we have the Eriskay Open golf tournament.
Well, we have now, for the very first one was on Saturday there, and a
grand Open it was. You can stick your Old Course and your Nick Faldos
and Tom Watsons, for the Eriskay Open is for golfers for fun. Truth to
tell, Faldo and Watson would love this astonishing little course.
Little? I should say. It is a six-hole course, carved out of some of the
roughest veldt you will find out of Africa.
The boys who thought up the golf course, just over a year ago, mowed
and scythed and scratched away, using only garden mowers, not the big,
easy, industrial mowers. It must have been a fearsome task and could
only have been a labour of extraordinary love. Well, it was.
The instigators of the Eriskay Golf Club were Willie Rusk, the Eriskay
ferryman, Patrick Forbes and -- he says so himself -- a peripheral
influence, the island's parish priest, Father Callum MacLennan.
If Willie is the driving force behind the establishment of this little
club -- which has 25 members, each paying #25 a year, with #5 for
juniors, and eat-your-heart-out Murray Ritchie and all you golf fanatics
who mortgage your houses for the yearly golf subs, here is a course
which has green fees of six quid for an all-day jaunt -- if Willie was
the driving force, and Paddy Forbes, the local postman or whatever else
he can work at be it barman or ferry carrier, then perhaps the natural
modesty of Father Callum should not overlook the fact that he must have
been very instrumental in obtaining the land from the local crofters to
get this course made at all.
The crofters have been splendid. They gave their land, along the
shore, gratis and for nothing. An addition to the island they reckoned,
with the proviso that some kind of sense should prevail about the
possibility that sheep and cattle, who have enough strife as it is with
the terrain and the climate and hardly need getting smacked with golf
balls from a long distance -- it is said that the sheep think that
''fore'' means four of their colleagues have been felled by a Maxfly --
with that proviso the crofters gave their land and failtie.
What made the course easier is that planning permission in the Western
Isles hardly applies. The bureaucracy of the urban areas is a major
urban blight, but here in the Outer Hebrides, bureaucracy is mainly
confined to sabbatarian idiocy (Eriskay, like South Uist is entirely
Catholic but the Island's council is strictly Wee Free and disallows fun
or ferry sailings on the Sabbath). But the South Hebrideans are made of
fun-loving stuff. No play-park is closed or swings chained up. And a
golf course now, and an Eriskay Open.
It was Willie Rusk, really, who started it. He and Paddy Forbes and
Father Callum who flew the idea over a dram, the way you do. Willie
started the club up because he was pissed off at having to trek across
to Barra, which has a nine-hole course, for a game. It is not far away,
but the ferry stops operating at 9am.
The absurd bridge to Skye -- a worthless piece of New Brutalist
architecture, which was neither wanted nor needed -- is in sharp
contrast to the necessity of a causeway from South Uist to Eriskay. For
a distance you could damn-near swim -- it takes 10 minutes by ferry -- a
causeway would be cheap and, and it would keep the people, 150 in all
today, on the island. But for the time being, the bridge is the golf
club, the brainchild of Willie, Paddy, and Father Callum. But to the
Eriskay Open.
Another notion of the indefatigable Mr Rush. Oddly, Willie and Paddy
are both incomers, but not the way you think; not White Settlers,
nothing to do with retired army officers and the like, (my own father's
island, Mull, is known as the officers' mess); Willie and Paddy came
here as little children, adopted by Eriskay people. They have done well
and prospered, and so, too, has Eriskay at that.
So when Willie thought up the grandiose idea of an Eriskay Open, it
stood to reason that it would happen. I don't know how long it took to
organise the Scottish Open, but it took Willie and co a week-and-a-half
to get Eriskay off the ground. Mind you, he was helped a little by the
hand of God in the sense that I myself have never seen better weather
anywhere or any time. (Also by the hand of greenkeeper, young Jo-Jo
Campbell, the son of mine host, the wonderfully hospitable Morag, who
runs the best self-catering place I've ever encountered, had much to do
with the superb condition of the greens.)
The sky was of a blue which made you think of Elizabeth Taylor's eyes
in National Velvet, and the sea was as azure enough to be liquid lapis
lazuli. There was a breeze gentle enough for the hand of a virgin lady
to dampen your brow. Here, that's enough poetry.
The course is very small, as one local put it: ''Och, it's quite a big
course for its size,'' a lovely piece of irrevocable Gaelic logic. Just
a strip along an incredibly lovely coastline, it is absolutely natural.
Jack Nicklaus wouldn't need to change a thing. It even has sand bunkers.
Well, it doesn't really. It is sandy beaches and as Eriskay's course is
so small, it is not hard to land your ball on them.
Think of the sheer romance of having to thrash your golf ball out of a
sandy bunker which was the beach on which Bonnie Prince Charlie landed
on 23rd of July, 1745. Well it's there, and it's a bunker.
The Open kicked off at 10.30 in the morning, with pipers and an
entourage of small girls in kilts, and damn-near everybody else on the
island. The 13 invited Barra club members started. They did well. But
not as well as Paddy Forbes. He won the Eriskay Open competition trophy,
a handsome silver cup donated by Grampian Television, who also presented
him with two return tickets to Glasgow by Loganair. Grampian filmed this
unique wee event and it will go out on Scottish on Monday lunchtime,
presented by young Angela NicFhionghuin.
There was a lot of sponsorship, too, and Paddy won the other splendid
trophy presented by the Grampian Gaelic people, the Media Nan Eilean
Trophy. Considering that the band, Schiehallion, from Glasgow in fact,
had contributed a bottle of malt for a prize, I thought it only fitting
that The Herald stuck a bottle of Glenfiddich in for the Media Trophy.
There you are, Paddy, that's a wee dram for me when you come to Glasgow.
Another bit of Gaelic logic. Said Paddy to me at the dance at night:
''It'll never be repeated that,'' he said, ''the first name on the
trophy. You can't ever repeat that.''
I was having a goldie with Gordon Hunter, a seven-handicap golfer from
Milngavie, and fellow fanatic Bob Graham from Glasgow, who later sat in
with the band, and local Eriskay resident originally from Port Glasgow,
Lawrie Beaton. ''Did you hear that?'' I said. Lawrie acknowledged the
absurdity and told Bob to go up there on the stand and repeat Ye Banks
of Sicily, and I danced myself. The way I shall dance again when I
repeat my visit next year to the banks and beaches of Eriskay.

Music
RICH and multi-faceted though the Aberdeen International Youth
Festival is, this year it has added another string to its bow by linking
with Aberdeen University in the quincentenary celebrations of that
august establishment.
On Saturday, one of these linked events brought performers from two
even older universities -- Glasgow and the Charles University of Prague
-- in an unusual double concert of orchestral and choral music.
The Czech university draws its choir from a huge campus of more than
30,000 students. Many of the choir look as though they are staff rather
than students, and they have a distinctive performing style. Under
director Jaroslav Byrch, they unveiled a raft of music completely
unknown in this country: Czech sacred music from across the centuries,
extremely lyrical, sonorous, and overtly beautiful.
The choir's style is a rather restricted one -- they are good at what
they do, but their range of dynamics and colour is limited. They showed
no evidence of a beefy sound, and seem to have cultivated a deliberately
restrained effect, almost discreet and slender -- a wee bit too fragile
when they reached the lush pastures of Verdi. When they did cut loose,
in a rollicking Bohemian folk song cycle at the end, they displayed an
athleticism and panache that had been missing until that point.
The choir was followed by Glasgow University's student-run Kelvin
Ensemble who sounded dangerously insecure in Edward McGuire's Symphonies
of Trains, a work that despite obvious graphic touches of drive and
momentum, is in fact a pretty uncompromising and taxing piece of music.
With the dazzlingly articulate and brilliant Angela Whelan (a real
future star) as soloist in Hummel's Trumpet Concerto, and with Nigel
Boddice conducting, the orchestra was on firmer ground, more assured,
more polished.

PAVIN, Couples, Montgomerie, Faldo. All these are insantly recognised
as some of the world's leading golfers. Even further down the order,
Parvenik and Gilford are well-known. They all have become public
figures. We feel we know them, their life-styles, their quirks, their
superstitions even.
But apart from Laura Davies, how many of the leading women players are
generally recognised? Therein lies the problem.
The women's game has always been dogged by lack of belief, lack of
sponsorship, and frequently lack of serious coverage. All this has to
change.
Many of the best European women were competing at Dalmahoy over the
weekend for the Scottish Open title, but few of them are known outside
their families.
Hopefully, after their stunning performances from the powerful Davies
to France's elegant Marie Laure de Lorenzi, attitudes will change.
Apart from the skills on display, the relaxed cameraderie and
downright friendliness was a breath of fresh air in comparison to the
back-biting and carping that sadly has become a feature of so many other
sports.
Laura Davies, the world No.1, coming straight from a 25-under-par
record-breaking win in Ireland the previous week, had ever right to be
optimistic. But when things didn't go according to plan in the first two
days, she didn't resort to the pouting and posturing that is
increasingly creeping in to a number of her male counterparts' game.
Instead, she smiled, signed autographs and generally got on with things.
Davies is a truly exceptional advert for her sport, not only because
of her powerful play, but also because of her fun-loving approach. Soon
after her par round on Thursday, she could be found, not on the practice
ground like so many others, but indulging in one of her other loves, by
following the fortunes of the horses at Pontefract and Bath at the small
on-course betting shop.
The championships were a joy for spectators. Encouragingly, the crowd
was 20% up on last year. The atmosphere was infinitely more civilised
than the hurly-burly of the Open. In some respects it is like a step
back in time, for although the competition was fierce, the ambience was
not.
The skills on display were mouth-watering and all this for a winner's
cheque of only #11,000. It's the kind of pay-off many caddies on the
men's tour can expect to take home.
For the spectators, Dalmahoy proved an excellent choice. No
grandstands there, and so there was an intimate, almost homely, feel to
the event. Who could fail to appreciate yesterday's ding-dong battle
between France's Patricia Meunier and the pugnacious Yorkshirewoman,
Alison Nicholas? Meunier's 30 for the first nine holes was a display of
golf of the highest quality. Even the most chauvinistic of men could not
fail to be inpressed.
Meunier had the benefit of psychological advice from an aunt, whereas
in stark contrast, one Swedish golfer dispensed with the services of a
caddie and pulled a trolley around herself. It was more like a midweek
bounce game. Can you imagine Greg Norman doing that?
The tournament gave Scotland much to be proud of, too. Janice Moodie,
the 22-year-old amateur, made an astonishing impact with her
seven-under-par final score. And all with grace and courtesy. She
follows in the footsteps of amateur Gordon Sherry's display in the Open
at St Andrews. Better, really. Because she won the amateur prize.
Moodie shows no signs of rushing to turn professional. Instead, she
intends to continue her studies at university in America. But when she
does turn professional, a bright future beckons.
In the past, television coverage of women's golf has been at best
sparse. But BBC deserves plaudits for the decision to give so much time
to the tournament.
The standard of golf will be an inspiration to amateurs all over the
country. Just as the tennis courts benefit from Wimbledon, we can expect
a rush out to the fairways this week.
But progress will really have been made when Joe Public -- and
Josephine, too -- can recognise the names of 10 leading women golfers.
Who knows?  One day Janice Moodie might be one of them.

Theatre
IF you're going to put on a crowd-pleaser the least you can do is do
it well -- and Ken Alexander's staging of Sue Townsend's comedy of
adolescent angst is such a charmingly good-natured production that it
instantly dispels any notion that it's only been put on as a cynical
ruse to get in the family holiday market.
As a play it's not quite the cash-in on the book of the radio series
of the souvenir pencil-case that you might expect. Townsend was a
reasonably respected fringe playwright before she invented the love-lorn
Adrian Mole, and this version, though it is not without excess baggage,
does make some attempt at character development and dramatic shape. As
much as that, though, it's Townsend's gift for one-liners that helps the
play move along, and I suspect it would appear a lot more flimsy if it
wasn't for the jolly set of songs by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley.
It's not that the mundane domestic drama particularly calls out for
the musical treatment, but the score does an important job at changing
the tone and punctuating the action. It also feeds into the general
upbeat mood of the Byre's updated Scots-accented production, performed
on a compact cartoon set designed by Rebecca Minto. In the lead role is
Billy Boyd who confirms the promise he showed in The Slab Boys last
month with a lovable, undemonstrative performance, all innocent looks
and awkward poses.
He's not the self-righteous martyr of previous Mole incarnations, but
that helps redirect the focus of fun on the bed-swapping shenanigans of
the grown-ups. Frivolous, forgettable, harmless -- and fun.

Clare Henry finds a display of artwork from the past 75 years confirms
Glasgow School of Art's reputation for producing dynamic painters whose
creations stand the test of time
WONDERFUL. Superb. A knock-out. The Continuing Tradition: 75 Years of
Painting at GSA 1920-95 is a truly ''must-see'' exhibition; something to
revel in and relish; an enjoyable burst of vigour, colour, and oil paint
which in these cool, conceptual, minimalist times is as welcome as a
long drink in a heat wave.
Smiles wreathed happy faces at the packed opening. Good punchy
painting is what Glasgow is famous for; seductive oil paint is what the
punters like to see; figurative painting is what Glasgow does best.
There is irrefutable evidence here, if it were needed, that Glasgow
has always produced damn good painters -- both figurative and abstract.
Will this powerful show affect the current debate about painting versus
conceptualism? Personally, I hope it makes for greater tolerance on both
sides.
It's high-time conceptualists appreciated the painters. Likewise,
painters should realise that the new-wave conceptualists are already an
established item on the international circuit, and be proud of them.
In the 1990s they are as sought after as Howson, Currie et al in the
1980s. It is not a competition. There is room for all.
With something of a coup de theatre, Sandy Moffat, Glasgow School of
Art head of painting and exhibition curator, has hung the Mackintosh
Museum with a series of humdingers. So, at the top of the stairs, you
are greeted by a powerful 1980s figurative triumvirate of Ken Currie,
Alison Watt, and Ian McCulloch interspersed with ''old masters'' Armour,
Donaldson, Eardley, McCance, and Colquhoun, who show student works of
the 1920s and thirties. This indicates the show's range and immediately
gives the lie to the oft-quoted ''Glasgow painters are all the same''
syndrome. Vigorous variety is what Glasgow is about.
Currie's black angst could not be further from Watt's serene
classicism. McCance's fractured futurism is poles apart from Eardley's
monumental Italian Beggar and Donaldson's gentle, beautiful symbolist
painting which began as a portrait of a friend's wife.
Yet Mary Armour's diploma Pit-Head Scene, (a controversial 1925 sally
against the customary nymphs and suchlike) does prefigure the social
realism of the 1980s.
Another impressive early Donaldson, Pattern of Flags 1937, again shows
his love of allegory. A powerful still life is wet off the easel. It was
painted just before his 79th birthday. Emilio Coia can claim more than
80 energetic years, as his wicked caricature GSA Staff 1928 and his
recent Festival drawings demonstrate. Mackintosh Patrick, too, is still
busy, vide his immaculate landscapes. Artists sure do lead long,
productive lives.
The show, of course, has the ideal setting, with paintings gathered
together in the studios where all these artists began their careers.
Many pictures were actually painted here -- a poignant homecoming.
Charles Rennie Mackintosh's famous building has been well spruced up
for the occasion. Never have I seen these huge studios look so good.
It's a privilege to work there, as many GSA graduates know. The
newly-sanded entrance floor and opalescent window drapes (sponsored by
Mandors) have definitely enhanced things.
Moffat groups the pictures roughly by theme: a room each for
landscape, still life, portraits, abstracts, narrative -- but
intelligent hanging has juxtaposed like minds to create fascinating
cross-fertilisation and links of admiration and friendship spanning 75
years.
One's peers and teachers often provide a rich source of food for eyes
and minds. Thus the young McCulloch hangs by his hero William Crosbie.
Fletcher must have been influenced by William Scott. Knox's third-year
student work a la Braque hints at things to come. Paul Klee inspired
Adam Crawford, while Goudie, ''a real whiz kid prodigy'' is represented
by a 1953 Marriage at Cana displaying his incredible youthful skill.
Pure abstraction is rare, (Pollock, Stewart, the young McCulloch; a
brand new luminous Robertson) but here is a new discovery. Elsa Vaudrey
was born in 1905, trained at GSA from 1924-27 but did not make the
breakthrough into abstraction until she was in her sixties. Four lyrical
paintings show the same kind of sensitivity as one finds in Barns
Graham, Gear, and even Derek Roberts.
Portraiture features strongly across the generations. Watt's
self-portrait is hung between William Armour's lovely 1926 portrait of
Mary, and McCance's 1918 Agnes Parker. Nearby, Jenny Saville, Alison
Harper, Rosemary Beaton and Bet Low are among the 18 women represented
from a total of 50 artists. Not a bad percentage.
We are familiar with Low's Skye landscapes but, another surprise, her
1940s portraits of characters from the Unity Theatre are extraordinary:
rugged, and boldly expressionist. ''I think Bet is the star of the
show,'' says Moffat.
Powerful images of the body by Morrison, Hunter, Saville and McPhail
('McPhail invented this way of painting. Saville picked it up,''
explains Moffat) are complemented by Peter Howson's etched Saracen Heads
and Currie's Sick Heads which show the seamy side of Glasgow life.
What comes over forcibly is that for 75 years Glasgow artists have
deployed a directness of expression, emphasising instinct, independence
and imagination, in a painterly language where accessibility and
communication are paramount.
And surely this is right. Glasgow painting is about communication --
but this doesn't mean it has to be popularist. I'm horrified to learn
that Glasgow's year of Visual Arts 1996 is soon to be launched in London
with none other than the amateur English artist Beryl Cook, a former
boarding-house landlady who paints fat, vulgar characters. ''It will
make Glasgow a laughing stock,'' is the general reaction.
During the past 150 years dynamic, intelligent painters from GSA have
establish Scottish art on the international stage. How do they feel
about Beryl Cook? Unhappy.
Back in the Mackintosh building I marvel that such a brilliant show
could be put together in such a short time. Yes, there are omissions. It
should be bigger, more comprehensively historical, with a big fat
catalogue -- but GSA's 23% funding cuts made it impossible. Many feel
Kelvingrove or the Scottish National Gallery should have masterminded
this show, but the in-house, home-grown affair is pretty good.
I trust someone will ensure the lottery moguls visit this show, so
that they better understand the merit of GSA's lottery application.
I have complaints. The labels lack basic information -- no artist's
date of birth. Neither is this wonderful show advertised at all. It
deserves banners and flags, posters in the underground, AA signs and
flyers everywhere -- even in Edinburgh. Rarely can the public visit
GSA's studios, yet until September 2 the Mackintosh Building is open to
all -- and it's free.
Don't miss this chance to see Glasgow School of Art at its best.

Celtic 1, Newcastle United 1
THE return to Paradise was not the triumphant one Celtic and their
legions of fans had hoped for. Nevertheless, it was a day which will
live in the memories of the faithful, a day when their Hampden exile
ended, when the vision of a brave new world was extended to them by way
of the impressive new stand, and when record signing Andreas Thom made
his debut.
There was also the little matter of the game itself against a
Newcastle United side which manager Kevin Keegan hopes will be good
enough, after a summer spending spree which put even Rangers in the
shade, to take the Premiership title.
On that front, the most important after all, Celtic found themselves
in command for the first 45 minutes and then seemed strangely subdued in
the second half.
So much so that Keegan remarked afterwards: ''At the end there was
only one team going to win that game -- and that was us.''
Earlier, though, the Tyneside manager had admitted: ''I had to say to
my lads at half-time that if they could not do better, then they would
be back out on the training ground until we got things right.
''Celtic looked really sharp and inventive, and John Collins was
outstanding. But we had to do better and although it was our first major
game against good opposition, I was determined to do better. That's why
I spoke to the players at half-time.
''That worked, and we saw signs of what Les Ferdinand can do for this
club. In fact, once he and David Ginola get an understanding going, then
I think we will have to put a Government Health Warning on the pair of
them.''
For Celtic, of course, the main matter on hand was the introducion to
Parkhead of Andreas Thom, and, also of Pierre van Hooydonk, who spent
his previous matches for the club performing at Hampden.
After his first outing at the new-look stadium the giant Dutchman
grinned: ''It is something special for me to be here at last. The other
players had told me about the atmosphere and it was every bit as
impressive as they said.
''Honestly, the noise was incredible. And this is with just one new
stand. It is going to be an important weapon for us in the league games
we are getting ready to face. But we know we have to be more consistent
if we are to take the title.
''I enjoyed playing with Andreas Thom and, given time, we will get a
good understanding going. He showed today what he can provide for the
team. His pace won us the penalty and once he settles he will be really
important. It's a nice thought for me to team up with him.''
Thom himself admitted afterwards: ''I felt some cramp in my leg and
had to go off. Obviously, I was a little nervous but the supporters were
so good to me. All I want to do is help bring the club success and it
does not matter whether I score the goals or not, as long as I can make
a contribution.''
It was that way against Newcastle, when Thom's pace carried him beyond
defender Darren Peacock, who then had to haul down the German
internationalist with a despairing late tackle.
John Collins, magnificent once more, scored with the penalty kick to
give Celtic their half-time lead.
In the second half, Ginola took revenge on the fans who had jeered him
throughout the match, because he had chosen to go to Newcastle instead
of Celtic, by setting up the equaliser for Les Ferdinand.
And before the end Ferdinand almost grabbed the winner with a solo run
from almost the halfway line which demonstrated why Keegan had paid more
than #6m to buy him from Queen's Park Rangers.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, McNally, Mowbray, Grant, Vata,
O'Donnell, van Hooydonk, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- Walker, Donnelly.
Not used: Bonner, Falconer.
NEWCASTLE UNITED -- Srnicek, Hottiger, Beresford, Peacock, Fox, Howey,
Lee, Beardsley, Ferdinand, Ginola, Sellers. Substitutes -- Clark,
Harper, Watson, Elliot, Kitson, Gillespie.
Referee -- H Dallas (Bonkle).

Stuart Trotter assesses the achievements of Ian Lang during his five
years of holding the fort at the Scottish Office
AS Michael Forsyth sweeps through the Scottish Office and, in due
course, Scotland, with the enthusiasm of a new broom, the more orthodox
five-year reign of his predecessor may temporarily seem overshadowed.
Ian Lang was not a politician who set out to dazzle but, in fact,
Forsyth is now trying to repeat in 1997 the act that Lang and Major
pulled off to the general amazement in 1992 -- actually improving the
Tory position in Scotland.
Instead of the expected near wipe-out, the Conservatives won two more
seats and inched their share of the vote up from 24% in 1987 to 25.7%.
It may not have been quite as marvellous a recovery as a staggered
media reported at the time but that it was done at all owed a lot to
Lang being one of those who influenced John Major to make defence of the
Union a rather unlikely key theme of his UK campaign. Leading the tiny
band of Scottish Tories -- between nine and 11 during his time in office
-- he was following in the lengthening tradition of running a minority
government in Scotland. His role in the first Major leadership campaign
seemed bound to be rewarded yet he has said he was surprised to be given
the Scottish Office. Indeed, he has served longer there than any
post-war Minister, starting as the Scottish Whip in the 1980s and
working his way through the ministerial ranks.
Economic performance in Scotland was looking healthy enough, relative
to the rest of UK, as Lang changed jobs, and during his time Scottish
unemployment fell below the national average and just after he left came
in below that in England's South-east. He could claim to have played his
part, seeing Scottish Enterprise into operation when he was Industry
Minister as well as the development of Locate in Scotland. In America,
Japan, and Europe he did his bit drumming up extra trade for Scotland.
Almost #500m was found to make the transition to the single business
rate with England that Scottish business had long demanded, and the
Scottish Enterprise capped interest rate scheme for small businesses has
also been well received.
In education, among the reforms proposed by the Howie Committee he
attached great importance to the need to set targets for vocational
education.
Health threw up more problems. The Fyfe-Peterken affair was, if
nothing else, a public relations disaster; HCI went sour and the
handling of developments at the Stonehaven Hospital, where he had to
watch a less-than-marvellous presentation by Grampian Health Board,
proved that in the area of health especially one piece of bad publicity
can obscure a lot of progress. All mainland hospitals in Scotland are
now trusts. GP fund-holding is expanding and, as Ministers always
emphasise, NHS treatment remains free at the point of use.
There was speculation that some of the original proposals for local
government reform originated elsewhere. The Opposition reckon the Tories
got the blame for gerrymandering and will take the blame, in due course,
for higher bills as a result of the change. The Conservatives argue that
unitary authorities will prove popular and in the long term cheaper,
although there will, no doubt, be some years of tedious debate about
that. If Eastwood and Stirling do seem to be created with Tory interests
in mind at least Clackmannan was allowed to get into the act and many on
the Labour side are not ungrateful for the disappearance of Monklands.
One of Lang's toughest battles was resisting the privatisation of
Scotland's water. Many of his Cabinet colleagues thought that, give or
take South West Water, privatisation had worked pretty well in England
and did not see why Scotland should be any different. Lang, on this as
on issues like forestry and continuing high subsidies to the isles,
argued that Scotland was different. Though the Opposition claim that
Conservative-appointed quangos running water boards is little better
than privatisation, some quietly admit that keeping the boards in public
ownership was an achievement.
Perhaps Lang's dislike for over-the-top gestures has helped him with
Cabinet colleagues. They know he is not a man to cry after the decision
has been taken and that has helped. Despite a spat with the media, who
decided that Rosyth had been closed as a major naval base while he said
it hadn't, a lot of quiet, determined committee work ensured that
Scotland's defence establishment came out of the defence review less
badly hurt than it could have been.
Keeping Scotland's above-average share of UK spending is not an annual
foregone conclusion. English Tories are casting increasingly envious and
critical eyes on it.
English reporters who read in their cuttings the ubiquitous reference
to Lang's membership of the Cambridge Footlights group sometimes
wondered aloud to Scottish colleagues why he seemed so bland. Clearly
the brains and the wit were there but being kept in almost continuous
reserve.
However, those who have heard an after-dinner speech know about the
wit. During the public debates with the other Scottish party leaders he
showed style as well as grasp batting on a distinctly unfriendly wicket.
Given the platform of the Tory party conference he delivered a speech
perfectly tailored to the occasion that made many representatives keen
to know more about this personable Minister in charge of a faraway
country of which they knew little.
A key player in the second Major leadership campaign, not just his
loyalty but his class was rewarded. He now ranks seventh in the Cabinet
pecking order. Ironically, sitting as he does for highly marginal
Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, his future career may depend on how
successful Michael Forsyth is in restoring Conservative fortunes in
Scotland.

A magnificent garden gifted to the nation is at the centre of a bitter
battle between the brothers who donated it and the National Trust for
Scotland, Keith Sinclair discovers
WHEN two brothers gifted their beautiful rhododendron garden in Argyll
to the nation in March 1992 -- largely because age was hindering their
ability to maintain it -- they could scarcely have anticipated the
bitter dispute over its management that was to follow.
Edmund and Harry Wright, who bought the 21-acre Arduaine Garden, near
Oban, 24 years ago and transformed it into a garden of national renown,
say they would never have donated it to the National Trust for Scotland
if they had known the heartache it would cause them.
Everything in the garden, which is situated on a promontory bounded by
Loch Melfort and the Sound of Jura and climatically favoured by the Gulf
Stream, is not coming up roses, according to the brothers. They claim
the garden is being mismanaged, with plants dying through lack of care,
and have asked the NTS to replace its Arduaine Garden local advisory
committee with a new, more powerful local management committee.
Edmund, who is 68, and Harry, 78 -- formerly Essex nurserymen who now
live in their own house overlooking Arduaine Garden -- claim the NTS
has, during the past three years, breached a number of conditions the
brothers laid down at the time of the donation.
The brothers say the garden is being mismanaged and plants such as the
rare Rhododendron Semibarbatum flower, which thrived when the brothers
managed the garden, are being allowed to disappear.
''The garden was in perfect condition when we gave it to the trust,''
says Edmund, ''but it has been neglected in a way we could never have
imagined, with plants not being properly pruned or kept apart.
''If one had sold it one has no rights whatsoever to say what they
should do and you accept that. But you give it to them on the
understanding that they are going to observe your wishes and the
conditions drawn up by a solicitor.''
The brothers are worried that the reputation of what is one of
Argyll's biggest tourist attractions -- 20,700 people visited it last
year -- is being harmed, and a large sign erected in their garden in May
1993, which makes their feelings plain in full view of visitors, still
stands as a symbol of their fury.
The solution to the problem would, they claim, be the transfer of head
gardener Mr Maurice Wilkins, who previously worked at Ross Priory on
Loch Lomondside, to another trust post and the appointment of a new head
gardener.
The trust rejects the brothers' criticism and says Arduaine is, and
will continue to be, maintained ''to the highest possible standard''
with existing staff.
Many local people dismiss the issue as a minor dispute. As one
observer said at the weekend: ''The garden is in a perfectly good state;
it's just that some of the trust's ideas are not the same as the
brothers'.''
John Basford, chairman of the advisory committee, who was head
gardener at the trust's Brodick Castle for 34 years, is generally happy
with Arduaine, which he says is still a beautiful garden.
''A horticulturist might notice some problems in the garden but from
the visitors' point of view it's fine. There are things that want doing
from a horticultural point of view, but I'm sure they will get done.''
An end to the dispute appeared to be in sight on July 11 when trust
chairman Hamish Leslie Melville wrote to Edmund stating that the trust
agreed with his suggestion that the local advisory committee, of which
the Wrights are members, should be replaced.
Mr Leslie Melville said the advisory committee was being disbanded and
confirmed that he would ensure work laid down by the proposed management
committee was ''adhered to by Maurice Wilkins''.
Sir Ilay Campbell, a member of the advisory committee who runs Crarae
Gardens on the shores of Loch Fyne, agreed to accept the chairmanship of
the proposed committee.
Mr Leslie Melville also said he hoped the Wrights would be able to
participate in the committee, but added that he expected the large sign
and two smaller ones would be removed from the brothers' garden.
However, talks between the Wrights and a delegation led by Mr Leslie
Melville broke down a week ago after Edmund said he did not want the
committee to be responsible to the trust's Central Scottish Gardens
Committee and that they would be unwilling to work with the head
gardener.
This prompted the trust, which maintains the brothers have no legal
right to a say in how the garden is run and could not accept their
demands, to take the unusual step of issuing a public statement.
The trust said attempts to improve relations with the Wrights had met
with a complete lack of success, adding: ''It has been decided with
regret that the management of the garden must continue as at present,
but clearly and sadly without the goodwill, support, or co-operation of
the Wright brothers.''
It said the Wrights had demonstrated an ''unjustified animosity''
towards Mr Wilkins from the outset, adding that the brothers' condition
for supporting the trust was that he must be removed.
This was unacceptable in view of the ''overwhelming public acclaim of
the garden'' and the support of its present management by both the
trust's Scottish Gardens Committee and the rest of the local advisory
committee apart from the Wrights.
The trust regretted that such a hostile situation should exist with a
property donor, but reaffirmed it had a duty ''to run its properties in
the manner it thinks most beneficial for their long-term good and for
the benefit of the nation''.
The Wrights were angered by the trust's statement, claiming it was
taking this stance because the brothers did not have the means to take
legal action, but later made a conciliatory move when Edmund wrote to Mr
Leslie Melville saying they would participate in a new management
committee because their involvement was necessary if the garden was to
be ''rescued''.
The one proviso was that the head gardener be moved to another trust
property should he fail to carry out the management committee's
instructions.
The trust, clearly having lost patience with the Wrights, reiterated
at the weekend that its position remained as outlined in the public
statement. In other words, a new management committee will not be formed
and the trust will manage the garden as it sees fit.

THE hot weather might have been to blame for the moistness in my eyes
at Celtic Park about 2.30pm on Saturday. Or it could have been an
emotional tear. After all, it's not every day Tommy Burns tells you he
loves you.
The occasion was the opening of Celtic's new stand. There were three
speeches in a range of accents: North American twang, London laddish,
and good old-fashioned Glaswegian.
Fergus McCann, the boy from Kilsyth, was the man with the
transatlantic accent. ''Thank you,'' he began. ''That's enough,
Fergus,'' came a voice from the crowd, making the not unreasonable point
that speeches are not the currency of a day at football.
But Fergus persevered and thanked everybody on behalf of everyone
else. He thanked the construction workers, but thankfully not by name.
After Mr McCann's businesslike approach to the big day, manager Tommy
Burns made a short, emotional statement. He mentioned his wife and kids,
told us that his ''Ma is here too,'' and said that he loved us all and
that we would never walk alone. It may be that the microphone packed in
at that moment, but I suspect that Tommy Burns was just as choked as the
rest of us.
Rod Stewart came on and was described as Celtic's No.1 fan, a
description which does not ring true when you look around at some of the
fanaticism among the ranks at Parkhead.
The singer told us a football match was no place to make a speech and
said a very few words before cutting the ribbon to hansel the new stand.
Four thousand green-and-white balloons were simultaneouly released,
giving rise to the comment that if three or four more balloons in
green-and-white were released, the team could be substantially improved.
Rod turned down the opportunity to lead the faithful in a spot of
community singing. This was left to a group of Irish-Scottish folk
singers called The Peatdiggers. They gave pelters to the club song,
Hail, Hail, the Celts Are Here, with the full-blooded, unexpurgated
lyrics including the bit where they stated that they did not care what
''the animals say.'' Glen Daly, in the cleaned up, official version
merely states in the same passage that he ''will be there to give the
boys a cheer.''
The Celtic fans were most musically stirred when the Peatdiggers sang
a song about somewhere or something called Athenry. Despite having
enough Irish blood in the veins to be touched by the song, I can't
understand why it has become the Tims' new anthem, but I am pleased to
see it replace songs about soldiers being wee and references to machine
guns. I can understand even less why such a nice tune should infuriate
members of a certain other tribe.
Equally contentious an issue on the Glasgow football scene are the
flags which are flown from the stands. Tom Grant, the Celtic stadium
director, felt compelled to have the master of ceremonies explain the
flags atop the new stand. They included the flags of Scotland, England,
Germany, Albania, Holland, and the Republic of Ireland.
Ah, yes, the flags of the different nationalities who play for Celtic.
Presumably, if Pat Bonner leaves, the famous tricolour will be furled
and put in the cupboard until Celtic play another southern Irishman.
But what about the new stand? It is majestic, sweeping, and awesome
and a great place to watch football. It makes the other new stands in
Scottish football, even those at Ibrox and Hampden, appear pedestrian
and boxlike by comparison.
When the rest of the stadium is in place, the atmosphere at Old Firm
matches is going to be unbelievable.
The weather was blistering at Celtic Park and, thankfully, the wiring
for the electrically-heated seats was not connected. Many of the new
Celtic investors were proudly sporting the smart green blazers which
were part of the package. One had a solid gold ''Hail, Hail'' tie-pin,
but I'm told that was not part of the supporters' kit deal.
As the afternoon heat intensified, more and more of the Parkhead
nouveau riche had discarded not only the blazer, but the tie and smart
white shirt. What they needed, as they sat stripped to the waist, was
some official Celtic suntan lotion or a club knotted-hankie to protect
the bald heid from the relentless rays of the sun.

ONE of the most outrageous blunders in athletics history has negated
the finest hour of Scottish marathon runner Trudi Thomson. The
organisers of the World championships admited yesterday that the course
was 400 metres short.
Thomson, Pitreavie's world ultra silver medallist, who sliced 62
seconds from her lifetime best to finish as the leading Briton, was
devastated to learn that this performance, which would have launched her
into the national all-time top-10, will never be recognised.
All three medallists, but only five athletes in all, ran best-ever
times. The winner, European champion Manuela Machado (2hr 25min 39sec)
took more than two minutes from her best, while runner-up Anuta Catuna
(2-26-25), with whom she had staged an hour-long battle, set a Romanian
national record which will not be ratified.
Athletes who believed they had achieved the Olympic qualifying
standard will now have to race again.
A disgusted Machado said: ''If they want me to go and do the extra 400
metres now, I'll do it.''
She was surprised at her time in that heat and asked, on crossing the
line, if she should run a further lap. Many athletes were confused by
the instructions, and Thomson also attempted to run an extra lap.
''I deeply regret this unfortunate mistake, which will not affect the
final placings,'' said competitions director Carl-Gustav Tollemar.
''It's my fault, nobody else's . . . I am ashamed.''
Thomson had been delighted with her twenty-second place in 2-41-42.
The shade temperature was 75[DEG], but there was little of that on the
boiling tarmac of a carnival opening Saturday afternoon. Out there on
the road, it was nearly 15[DEG] hotter. Eleven of the 43 starters failed
to finish.
Edinburgh's Alison Rose was in obvious distress, twenty-eighth in
2-45-52, with tears the last moisture to be surrendered by her
dehydrated body as she finished three minutes outside her best.
With the race, held mid-afternoon in defiance of competitors' wishes,
producing incompetence of such magnitude, gob-smacked pundits would have
been unsurprised had Tollemar announced a re-run this morning.
Thomson rightly views this debut UK marathon run as a triumph. ''I'm
disappointed at losing my personal best, but I'm still pleased with my
performance,'' she said.
After the birth of her third daughter six years ago, Thomson weighed
13.5 stones, suffering from the condition, bulimia. Now she barely
weighs eight stones.
''Yet I still suffer,'' she revealed. ''It will never leave me. When I
look in the mirror, I see a different person from everyone else. I still
think I am fat.
''I can't believe what I have achieved. Just standing on that
start-line was a triumph for me. I wondered what I was doing with all
these stars. I'm used to much longer distances. It was a bit of a sprint
for me.''
The eve of the race was the fortieth birthday of her husband, Ian. ''I
saw him for just 45 minutes. Enough time to hand him the children's
birthday cards, and a wee slice of birthday cake.''
Machado finished blowing kisses to the crowd. The difference in the
shortened course, worth around 90 seconds, means she would still have
set a personal record.
The only other title of the opening day, the women's shot, went to
former European champion Astrid Kumbernuss. The 6ft 3in German, almost
double Machado's weight at 14.5 stones, reached 21.22m, the longest
women's shot putt for five years and the biggest championship
title-winning putt since the Seoul Olympics.
Kumbernuss dismissed the inevitable question: ''I have been
dope-tested four or five times this year in competition and eight times
out of competition.''
Britain's Judy Oakes, in her nineteenth international year and on her
seventy-first appearance for Britain, reached 17.87m, missing the final
by just one place.

the Scottish Amateur
UNTIL he so emphatically won the J &amp; B Scottish Amateur title at
Southerness on Saturday, Simon Mackenzie was regarded as an
under-achiever, a stylish player who had taken the 1989 youths' title,
reached the semi-final of the 1993 National championship, and become an
established internationalist, but whose game was somehow lacking in
girr.
The West Linton golfer's victory by 8 and 7 in the 36-hole final over
the holder, Troon Welbeck's Hugh McKibbin, probably came too late to
gain him one of the two remaining places in the Britain and Ireland team
to meet the United States in the Walker Cup match next month at Royal
Porthcawl. But Mackenzie has other quite impressive credentials.
A comparative rarity these days, an amateur who works for a living
rather than serving an apprenticeship for the professional ranks,
Mackenzie, aged 25, has this season been runner-up for the Scottish
strokeplay title and finished in the first 10 in four other such events.
Now the impression of diffidence he has always given should be
dispersed.
Afterwards, Mackenzie down-played the possibility of a late call to
the combined side's colours. ''I never even thought about the Walker
Cup,'' he said. ''I was nervous enough at the start of the final, so I
don't know whether I could stand the match.''
Mackenzie, like all other aspirants, will have to wait until after the
inaugural British Mid-Amateur championship at Sunningdale later this
month to learn who has filled the last two places. Likewise McKibbin,
the severity of whose defeat, even as defending champion, is unlikely to
have advanced his claims for consideration.
The amateur approach of Mackenzie, so unlike the programmed mind-set
of the embryo professional, surfaced at the final's last hole. ''If I
make this 10-foot putt,'' Mackenzie inquired of his caddie, Brian Smith,
''what's the position?'' Smith replied: ''I think you'll be dormie.''
Only when the SGU president, Dr George Gormley, declared the result did
Mackenzie realise he had won.
That outcome began to become probable in the first seven holes of the
inward half of the first round. In that space, Mackenzie went from two
up to one down and back again to two up. That recovery was based on
superior medium and long iron play. He missed none of the last four
greens in regulation, McKibbin all of them. Thus in the first round only
six holes were halved.
In hot sunshine and a dwindling breeze, McKibbin's game through the
green simply unravelled. Time and again he was in heather or bunkers,
whereas Mackenzie was straight and so kept out of these hazards.
With his wife, Linda, who is expecting their first child in January,
among a respectably sized gallery, Mackenzie forged steadily ahead after
lunch. When the match ended, more quickly than any since Colin
Montgomerie's 9 and 8 defeat of Alan Watt at Nairn in 1987, he was only
two over a very rigorous par.

SCANDINAVIAN MASTERS in Malmo
COLIN Montgomerie gave a broad hint yesterday that Jesper Parnevik
should be included in the European Ryder Cup team after the Swede
secured the Volvo Scandinavian Masters in Malmo.
Parnevik became the first Swede to win a European Tour event in his
own country when he shot a five-under-par 67 to beat Montgomerie by five
strokes with a four-round total of 270, 18 under par.
''I just hope that Bernard Gallacher was watching,'' said Montgomerie,
who began yesterday's round three shots behind Parnevik. ''Jesper never
missed a fairway, never missed a hole-able putt, and was very cool, even
though he had the whole of Sweden on his back. I was very impressed.''
Gallacher's problem is he has only two wild cards and one of those has
to go to Nick Faldo, while both Ian Woosnam and Jose Maria Olazabal may
not finish in the top 10 of the points table to gain automatic
selection.
Parnevik said: ''I talked a little bit with Monty about the Ryder Cup
on the course today, but I know the problem. Woosie and Olazabal are big
players and Woosie is playing great just now. If he could get his
putting together, he would be sensational.''
Vijay Singh, who won this event last year, took third place on 277 by
equalling the course record of 65.
Meanwhile, Mark Roe was disqualified after signing an inaccurate card
-- and he could be fined for alleged unprofessional conduct after his
playing partner, Mark Litton, complained about his antics on the course.
Roe, complaining of a locked knee, shot an inward 58, including two
10s and an 11 in a final-round 95, then signed for a 94.
Litton, who shot 74, told tournament referee John Paramor that Roe,
faced with a six-inch putt at the twelfth hole, knocked his ball 20
yards off the green. Paramor said the matter was being investigated.
Roe, who was only one over par after 11 holes, took 10 at the twelfth
and was five off the tee at the thirteenth. He finished that hole in 11,
but signed for a 10, causing his disqualification. He had another 10 at
the sixteenth and finished his round with an 8.
Asked why he had not walked in if his knee was hurting, Roe replied:
''I was walking towards the clubhouse, so I thought I might as well play
in.''
At the end of his round Roe lined up several youngsters, handed them
every ball in his bag and gave one of them his putter.
He is noted for his eccentricity and was fined for throwing spaghetti
over Russell Claydon in a restaurant during the French Open two years
ago. Leading aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
270 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 67, 67, 69, 67 (#108,330).

RECORD crowds for the championship were enthralled by a marvellous
exhibition of golf as Alison Nicholas came from behind to complete an
eleventh Tour victory when she won the Payne &amp; Gunter Scottish Open at
Dalmahoy yesterday.
Nicholas collected a winner's cheque for #11,250 when her closing 69
left her with a 16-under-par aggregate of 272, one stroke clear of
Patricia Meunier, from France. Marie-Laure de Lorenzi, also from France,
was third, one stroke further behind.
Laura Davies, the holder, had a final round of 67 to share fourth
place with Australian Corinne Dibnah. Scotland's Janice Moodie rounded
off a a fine first professional tournament with a 69, which left her the
leading amateur in seventh place.
For the last two rounds Meunier and Nicholas had enacted a matchplay
scenario which had kept appreciative galleries on their toes. In the
third round Nicholas had been five strokes ahead of the Frenchwoman, who
reduced her deficit to only one after a brilliant run of four
consecutive birdies from the thirteenth hole.
This proved to be nothing more than an aperitif for the final round by
Meunier, a serene golfer who goes quietly about her business in the
manner of the late Flory van Donck, from Belgium, during the immediate
post war years.
Meunier puts much of her success down to her aunt, Nicole, who
specialises in neurolinguistic programming, which gives people the
confidence to make their own decisions. If the product could be bottled,
she would find a ready market among golfers.
Nicholas started the final round one stroke ahead of Meunier, who drew
level with a brave birdie at the long first hole after striking her
opening drive into a fairway bunker.
It was the first of a remarkable six birdies in her first seven holes,
at which stage she had used her putter only eight times. Two strokes
changed hands when Nicholas missed a short putt at the sixth, and she
was two behind the Frenchwoman at the turn, despite holing from 15 feet
for an eagle at the long ninth to be out in 33.
Meunier had covered the first nine holes in a marvellous 30 strokes
and she went three strokes clear when Nicholas took 6 at the long tenth,
where she was bunkered. ''I thought I was playing for second place
then,'' said Nicholas later.
But it was the greater experience of Nicholas which prevailed down the
closing stretch. She birdied the eleventh, then Meunier dropped shots at
the twelfth, fourteenth, and sixteenth, where both were in the same
bunker, with Nicholas recovering from sand to 12 inches to save her 4
and take the lead she never lost.
Moodie had set Scottish hearts stirring when she reeled off four
birdies in a row from the third, where she struck a sand-iron to within
a yard of the hole. She dropped her only shot of the day at the eighth
and rounded off an admirable performance by saving her 4 at the
eighteenth after running through the green with her approach.

THE Commonwealth champions past and present, Liz McColgan and Yvonne
Murray, are set for a showdown 10,000 metres final on Wednesday, with
the world title the ultimate prize, writes Doug Gillon.
The pair dominated separate heats yesterday, both easing through in
second place, with the first eight to qualify. But Murray left the
stadium like a film extra from M*A*S*H.
Her legs, punctured and scraped with spike scores, carried four
bandages. ''It's all superficial,'' she said. ''No problem. I didn't
realise 10,000m running could be so brutal.''
Murray finished in 32min 16.76sec, easing at the line to be
fractionally headed by Derartu Tulu, the Olympic champion, just
five-hundredths quicker. A third Briton, Jill Hunter, also qualified.
The finishing order Tulu, Murray, and then a second Ethiopian,
Gatenesh Wami -- was identical to Murray's last road race, over 5000m at
Portsmouth.
New York Marathon winner Tecla Laroupe (Kenya) was fourth ahead of
Elana Meyer, South Africa's Olympic and Commonwealth 10,000m runner-up.
Murray was content to remain in second place until the final
lap-and-a-half of the 25 circuits. She shadowed every leader, but
declined to take it on any earlier -- ''there was no point.'' The
30-year-old Murray has recovered from what she thought was a virus. ''In
fact, it was an allergic reaction to the high pollen count at home. I'm
fine now.
''I have my plans for the final. If it is fast, great. And if it is
tactical, that's fine, too. I have my plans for either contingency.''
McColgan, winner of the title four years ago, is back in tunnel-vision
mode. ''That was a good race. I'm pleased, though it was pretty hot,''
she said.
Always in the lead group, she took it up seven laps from home, and her
final kilometre, in 3-03, blew the field apart.
Even on the last lap, with her final place assured, the Dundee woman
refused to give much ground to Fernanda Ribiero, Portugal's reigning
European champion. She finished in 32-33.87, with McColgan second,
two-hundredths behind in the same time as Lynn Jennings, America's
three-times world cross-country champion.
The Chinese, who took gold and silver two years ago, failed to survive
the heats, and will not be represented. The champions said to have been
fed on turtle-meat are now the tortoises.

Scul?tor George Wyllie explains why he is creating a new work in
Glasgow's George Square
THE Pacific Ocean does not lend itself to street parties, and on
VJ-Day there were no knees-ups will all the lights going on again and
not a slice of Spam in sight -- the way things were said to be at the
end of the European war. I cannot remember a single popular song written
about the Japanese.
This absence suggests that Japanese inscrutability baffled us and we
gave up on challenging them, even by the pathetic devastation of a comic
song.
The complexity of understanding the hari-kari honour of Japanese
culture still eludes me, yet their traditions seem to suggest that they
are intent on inflicting torture on themselves, and letting us know that
this is the Nipponese idea of having a good old Sumarai time.
If that's how the Japanese want to condition themselves to being brave
lads, then that might be OK for them, but it was certainly not OK by me
and the other sailors on HMS Argonaut who, when peace was declared, were
immediately sent ashore to urgently release hundreds of bony and
swollen-bellied servicemen from POW camps in Formosa and northern China.
In 1986 I wrote this. It is my memory of VJ-Day, and it still holds
good . . .
''Our ship was in the northern Pacific when the news of the bombing of
Hiroshima came over the radio. We welcomed this for we knew it meant the
end of the war. About two months later I visited Hiroshima with some
shipmates. We wandered among the ruins and I took a couple of
photographs. I had seen other places destroyed by bombs, and was
inclined to measure the devastation of Hiroshima against this. At that
time the idea of being 'anti-nuclear' did not exist. Radiation did not
occur to us, nor were we warned. We wandered amongst the exposed grid of
the streets, rubbed heat-pulverised granite through out fingers,
collected globules of molten glass, and saw charred tree trunks
everywhere. Scarred children played quietly.
On our ship we were never very keen on the Japs. They were a dangerous
and unpleasant enemy and we were glad to see them defeated. We used a
very clever bomb to do this, and it -- like the Japs -- caused a lot of
suffering. In the light of this experience, that should have been the
end of it. But like simple sailors confronted by an awesome immensity
too consequential to grasp, we cut loose the thought as though to let it
drift from memory. Others, stupid enough to think they understand,
believe that they do. The absurdity, the horror, the fact, and the
DIFFERENCE of Hiroshima is, that for the first time ever, the evolution
and eternity of this planet, its human race, and the culmination of the
energies -- which is fertility -- can be converted by a touch on an
idiot button, to sterility.''
Like I said, we were never very keen on the Japs, just like some Serbs
are not keen on some Bosnians who are not keen on Croats who are again
not all that keen on Serbs . . . and so on and on, and interminably on,
and always diminishing our humanity. So what about me and the Japs? A
positive or negative approach?
Fifty years on I've become a Scul?tor, and that question-mark insists
that I'll have to work on this. I'll have to find the link between us
and the alien and therefore strange Japanese, severely expressing their
precocious national pride with such uncompromising vigour. Somehow, a
truth which will be common to all of us will have to be wrested from our
absurdities, basic or immense. I have to take myself by the scruff of
the neck to attempt this -- even declare it.
Why? Because it is deadly to maintain hate. In that different future
demonstrated so clearly and so sadly by Hiroshima, we can no longer
afford the corruption of hatred. VJ-Day was not so much a victory, but a
warning given 50 years ago alerting all of us, to subvert the deadly
negative by the equilibrium of all that we feel to be positive.
My positivism will commence at noon next Saturday until noon on
Monday, August 14, and will happen in Glasgow's George Square where the
Cenotaph and everyone and anyone can see it. It is not a celebration,
not absolution, not atonement. It is possibly a commemoration, and at
best the beginning of a reconciliation. There will be a simple ceremony
at noon on Sunday within the sculptural grid of the streets of my
HIROSHIMA . . . marking VJ-Day.
Dead streets, heat-pulverised granite and charred trees together will
form a sad icon and near the Cenotaph, chrysanthemums for Japan and
Scottish Thistles. Fresh flowers offering hope.
May there be no more scarred children.
* George Wyllie is creating an installation in Glasgow's George Square
as part of the city's programme of events to mark the 50th anniversary
of the end of the Second World War. There will be free events in the
square on Sunday. Details of that and other events from the Ticket
Centre 041 227 5511.

I PLAYED alongside David Johnston in the dark blue of Scotland a few
times, and even back then there were a few things that set him apart
from us mere mortals.
For a start, he had hamstrings that needed stretched every two
minutes, he ran like a little spring lamb trying to escape from John
Jeffrey on the farm, and he thought so deeply about things that you
could have been forgiven for thinking that he was from a different
planet. The boy is a lawyer, after all. A lawyer who smokes.
When I spoke to him yesterday he hadn't had it from anyone official
that he is to be announced as head of Scotland's coaching effort later
today. ''I've read a couple of headlines, but I don't think that anyone
knows outside those in the meeting on Friday,'' he said. ''I was asked
if I was available, and I said yes. Assuming that Richie Dixon is the
other coach, then I don't mind what level I am in at. And even that
assumes quite a lot.''
But we don't have to assume too much in this instance. He will either
be the backs' coach or the chief coach, with Dixon in charge of the
forwards under him.
Johnston was the man who steered the Scottish A side to victory
against the Springboks at Melrose last season. He took Glasgow to
victory in the district championships. He was capped 27 times himself.
What he now becomes, after some time as second string to Dougie
Morgan, is the man who has to take the pressure when things get tough.
Morgan is perhaps one of the most pleasant men involved in rugby and it
was a tragedy to watch as the stress mounted over the past two seasons.
He carried the weight of Scotland's failures on his shoulders as if it
was all his fault, and we in the press put unrelenting force on him to
come up with results.
What I find fascinating about DJ's appointment is that so many people
have argued for so long that he was the genuine article in waiting that
we now expect Scotland's backs to produce the goods more often with the
ball in hand.
I find myself unable to join in the common elation after Scotland's
performance in the World Cup, because although we scored more points
against New Zealand than anyone else, our results went exactly as
predicted -- we lost to France and exited to New Zealand -- and our
Northern Hemisphere rugby looked second-class to the stuff laid out by
South Africa and the All Blacks.
What DJ will influence will be as much in the global rethink that is
bound to be happening around the way our team portrays itself on the
pitch as it strives to keep up.
In South Africa, Scotland still adhered to the deliberate set-up of
the ruck in front of the opposition, our tackling was not up to scratch
against the big men in midfield, and our transfer of the ball into space
was still second-class compared to the best.
Johnston, then, has a hard task ahead of him in an unforgiving world.
The Scottish season is about to start, and it will be one of the biggest
ever. It's a challenge. He always did like a challenge, did David
Johnston.

Derby County 3, Hearts 3
IT HAS taken 14 years and at least one U-turn for Jim Jefferies to
find his way back to Tynecastle.
Leaving through the players' exit in 1981 only to return through the
management door last Friday has been a long way for a short-cut. There
are some who feel he should have been given his chance earlier.
The 500 fans who made the 600-mile round-trip to Derby for Saturday's
3-3 draw at the Baseball Ground certainly left Jefferies in no doubt
that his return is warmly welcomed.
Jefferies had not tampered with Eamonn Bannon's last team selection
and instead watched from the directors' box, but there was no chance of
him keeping a low profile.
After watching Hearts fight back from 3-0 down to force a draw, he was
cajoled on to the pitch at the end as the supporters refused to leave
until he had taken a bow.
Yet his only tangible contribution was a few quietly-spoken words at
half-time. They were enough to transform Hearts from a shambolic outfit
into a team that can hardly wait for Newcastle to visit Tynecastle on
Wednesday.
It brought an end to the most turbulent week for Jefferies, who
admitted: ''I have been through a very traumatic time. When I saw the
backing Hearts had, it proved to me I'd made the right decision.
''A lot was made about the Falkirk fans' reaction to my decision, but
I was also concerned about the Hearts fans. That response has lifted all
the doubts. Now it's up to me to give them a team to be proud of.''
Marco Gabbiadini (2) and Paul Simpson had given Derby a 3-0 lead, but
two quick goals from John Robertson and David Hagen before half-time
reduced the deficit. The equaliser came 14 minutes from time, when
Darren Wassall scored an own-goal.

WELSH rugby's troubled summer took another twist when national team
manager Geoff Evans failed to turn up for a key practice match in the
build-up to the forthcoming tour of South Africa.
The former Wales and British Lions lock, caretaker manager for his
country's disappointing World Cup campaign, missed the clash with
Treorchy because he had left for a fortnight's holiday.
The development came after four players -- Wayne Proctor, Spencer
John, Emyr Lewis, and Andy Moore -- lost their tour places because
holiday commitments prevented them from taking part in Saturday's
Cardiff work-out.
Evans will now come under pressure to resign before the squad jet out
on August 21, if he is back in time.
''Geoff Evans is away on a two-week holiday, but it is not necessary
for him to be here because he is not a player,'' said Welsh Rugby Union
technical director Jeff Young.
Meanwhile, coach Alex Evans said the insistence on players turning out
for the training match was vital in setting standards in discipline.
He said: ''The attendance of the players at these sessions is
non-negotiable. It is not exactly the same thing for the management
team.''

EUROPEAN FOOTBALL
WITH less than a month to go before the start of the 1995-96 season,
Spain's first division may be expanded from 20 to 22 teams in an
embarrassing backdown after two teams were relegated for financial
irregularities.
Sevilla and Celta were demoted from division one to division three by
the Spanish Football League (LFP) last Tuesday when they failed to
provide bank guarantees to support a percentage of their 1995-96 budget.
The LFP said Albacete and Real Valladolid, relegated last season with
bottom club Logrones, would be restored to the 20-team first division.
But now the Spanish government has stepped in to recommend that
Spain's Superior Sports Council -- the country's top sporting authority
-- expand the first division, according to Barcelona sports daily El
Mundo Deportivo.
Enlarging the league to 22 teams would force a rescheduling of the
season's calendar, which is already complicated by the European
Championship finals in England next year on top of regular European club
competition.
But it would provide a solution to a situation which has seen 100
Sevilla fans go on hunger strike and thousands more in Seville and Vigo
-- Celta's home town -- take to the streets in protest.
Sevilla finished fifth in the top flight last season and qualified for
the UEFA Cup.
On Friday the Spanish cabinet discussed the situation and yesterday
Sevilla's long-serving club president Luis Cuervas resigned in the face
of constant barracking by fans.
Sevilla stand to lose more than #6m in revenue from sponsorship,
television rights, and publicity. Gate receipts will also inevitably
fall.

GRAEME Archer looked back on his victory in the ScottishPower National
Singles Bowls Championship just minutes after his 21-13 victory over
Oban's Willie Hay at Northfield on Saturday.
''I suppose my name was on it,'' said the 35-year-old Sighthill man,
reflecting on two 21-20 victories on his way to the final.
The first came early on Thursday evening when he edged out former
winner George Whitelaw, from Stonehouse, with a last bowl that carried
more than a hint of good luck about it, and the second came in his
semi-final, when he produced a superb last bowl to deny Falkirk's Alan
Hutchison.
Archer's final win was well merited. He dominated from the opening
ends, where he opened up a 5-0 three-end lead, despite some brave
rearguard action from Hay.
Despite his superiority in the bread-and-butter department of the game
-- the draw shot -- Archer showed only 12-10 ahead at 11 ends, but
unperturbed he edged his way to the title with nine further singles.
The junior singles title went to Glasgow for the first time when seven
shots over the last six ends turned a narrow 14-12 lead to a 21-12 win
for Croftfoot's Martin Bain over Colin Thorburn, of Thankerkton.
The pairs produced the closest finish of the six finals, victory going
to Newbridge's Alex Allan and Ian Robertson on the last bowl of an extra
end. Opponents, Caldercraig, lay three but Robertson's last bowl
deflected off a side wood and picked up the jack.
The triples promised to be a close-fought encounter between the strong
Mauchline and Kirkliston sides, but the Ayrshire outfit of Craig
Richmond, Jim Fleming, and Gary Hood got things all their own way,
winning 24-5.
Dreghorn lined up as favourites to take the fours title, with
internationalist George Adrain as skip and his father, Willie, the
former internationalist, at lead, but Bogleha' produced their secret
weapon in the shape of their teenage front end of James Rippey (17) and
Robert Menzies (16) and took the title with a 13-11 win.
Vale of Leven's Alistair McFadyen, Alex Bisland, John Wood, and John
Lewis picked up three shots over the last two ends to claim the senior
fours title with a 14-13 win over Rothesay. Results:
Singles: Semi-finals -- W Hay (Oban) 21, G Knox (Armadale) 18. G
Archer (Sighthill) 21, A Hutchison (Falkirk) 20. Final -- G Archer 21,
Hay 13. Junior singles: Semi-finals -- M Bain (Croftfoot) 21, D Thomson

Hargreaves, C Adrain, A Adrain) 10. Final -- Mauchline 24, Kirkliston 5.
Fours: Semi-finals -- Bogleha' (J Rippey, R Menzies, D McLellan, A
McKillop) 16, Crichton (J Cowan, J Gillespie, L W Moffat, L Moffat) 15
(after extra end); Dreghorn (W Adrain, G Coppard, R Campbell, G Adrain)
22, East Lothian Co-op (P Fallen, D Berwick, E SMith, W Dodds) 15. Final

Smith, J Barron, J Coull) 10; Rothesay (J Ramsay, A Hardie, A McCallum,

STRUGGLING West Indies received another knockdown blow yesterday --
from a little-known county bowler who was once an England amateur boxing
international.
Paceman Kamran Sheeraz, 21, dismissed Brian Lara for nought and took
five for 41 in all as West Indies limped to 186 for nine against
Gloucestershire at Bristol. That made it 11 wickets in the match after
his six for 67 haul in the first innings.
Richie Richardson's side, desperate for form after their defeat in the
Old Trafford Test, are now only 189 runs ahead after their second poor
batting display of the weekend.
Another problem for West Indies, four days before the crucial fifth
Test in Nottingham, is that Carl Hooper looks unfit for combat because
of a right index finger still not properly healed after it was cracked
10 days ago. Hooper, who retired hurt on Saturday during his brief
innings of seven, did not appear until the fall of the sixth wicket
yesterday -- and then faced just 10 balls, making four, before being
caught off bat and pad at silly point.
Only a fiery spell from Kenny Benjamin, who took four for nought in
three overs to clean out the tail, prevented Gloucestershire from
earning themselves a first innings lead after fine batting from Andrew
Symonds and Tony Wright.
Opener Wright went on to 73 after Gloucestershire resumed on 137 for
two, and 20-year-old Australian Symonds underlined his huge potential
with a 47-ball half-century.
Leg-spinner Rajindra Dhanraj was taken for 18 runs in one over,
Symonds cutting him to the boundary, swinging the next ball over
mid-wicket for six and then sweeping the next to the square-leg ropes.
West Indian opener Stuart Williams, who may have to play in the Trent
Bridge Test if Hooper is unfit, top-scored for the second day running --
striking Sheeraz over the short cover boundary for six in an 89-ball 56
which also included eight 4s.

NICK Fulwood and Heather Lockhart lifted the respective men's and
women's singles titles after hard-fought baseline battles at the Bank of
Scotland Scottish Hard Court championships at Dundee yesterday.
Fulwood, 31, showed glimpses of the form that took him to No.4 in the
British rankings six years ago as he dismissed Scottish No.4 Malcolm
Watt for the loss of just one game in Saturday's semi-final, but he was
made to work much harder for yesterday's 6-4, 6-4 win over hard-court
specialist Jason Barnett.
The 20-year-old Aberdonian, who had survived two match points as he
recovered from a 5-1 third-set deficit to upset title-holder Ken Wood
4-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the last four, pulled back from 5-2 down before
conceding the first set after 96 minutes, and threatened to cause an
upset as he established a 4-0 lead in the second. But he failed to
convert three game points on his service in the sixth game and the
Derbyshire coach drew on his experience to win six successive games to
clinch the #250 first prize.
World-ranked teenager Jennifer Duncan, who won the 21-and-under crown
on Saturday, looked set to add the women's title when she took the first
set 6-4 from Lockhart, but the Newlands player fought back to take the
next two 6-2, 6-4. Finals results:
Men: Singles: N Fulwood (Derbyshire) beat J Barnett (Ruthrieston) 6-4,
6-4. 21-and-under: Barnett beat S Crabtree (Nottinghamshire) 6-3, 6-2.
Boys' 18-and-under: R Hangar (Dorset) beat G Smith (David Lloyd CLub)

12-and-under: S Milne (Cults) beat R Allan (David Lloyd Club) 6-4, 6-4.
Men's doubles: Fulwood and Wood beat Watt and C McKnight (Newlands) 6-2,

Saunders (Perth) 6-4, 7-5. 14-and-under: J McDonald (Western) and T
Ogilvie (Perth) beat Gray and Hendry 7-6,3-6, 6-3.
Women: Singles: H Lockhart (Newlands) beat J Duncan (Games Club) 4-6,
6-2, 6-4. 21-and-under: Duncan beat N Burns (Whitecraigs) 6-1, 6-1.
Girls' 18-and-under: L Reilly (Thistle) beat C Mochrie (Abercorn) 6-2,
3-6, 7-5. 16-and-under: Reilly beat M Brown (Kirkcaldy) 6-3, 6-0.

CELTIC skipper Paul McStay will go into hospital for another ankle
operation today -- and that will keep him out of action for one more
month.
The problem, which has plagued McStay since he went through an
operation immediately after Celtic's Scottish Cup win, has been a piece
of loose bone in an ankle. Now another operation will clear the trouble,
but he will require 10 days in plaster and then a further two weeks or
more before he can start playing.
The operation will keep him out of Celtic's opening games at the start
of the season and out of both Scotland's European Championship ties,
against Greece next week and then Finland three weeks later.
There seems little chance that national team manager Craig Brown would
risk McStay against the Finns unless he had several games behind him. So
far, McStay has missed all six of Celtic's pre-season matches and is
well behind the other players in their preparations for the new season.
As well as the McStay blow, Celtic have further worries about young
defender Brian O'Neil, who was expected to return to the first team
sometime in October. Now that comeback, after another close-season
operation, will be delayed until the New Year.
That news, allied to the fact that Tony Mowbray will be suspended for
the first three games of the season, made Celtic move for Falkirk
skipper John Hughes at the weekend.
Hughes, 30, who is out of contract, has agreed terms with Celtic
manager Tommy Burns and will join the Glasgow club inside the next 24
hours. No fee has been agreed and it could be that the transfer figure
will be settled by a tribunal. I understand Falkirk will look for close
to #500,000 for the man who has been an inspirational figure for them
over the past few seasons.
Celtic's valuation is likely to be far less than that. But the player
will sign and be in place for the start of the season and the European
Cup-winners' Cup first round.
Falkirk chairman George Fulston last night admitted: ''It is the
second body-blow to hit the club. We lose our manager and assistant
manager, and then the club captain. I was negotiating a new contract
with John on Friday afternoon and then Celtic came in and that was that.
''I just hope we can get a manager in place by midweek and then start
moving forward again. That is the time-scale I have in mind.''

A UNIQUE programme of short courses planned to assist a wide spectrum
of small businesses improve their competitive edge is to be launched in
the autumn by Glasgow Opportunities Development Trust.
Jointly sponsored by Strathclyde European Partnership and by Glasgow
Development Agency, the programme is intended to assist participating
companies at executive level. Each of the four courses in the programme
can be taken separately if desired and all have been specifically
tailored to match European Partnership requirements in an area in which
a number of small business executives agree future business strategy has
to be shaped in the face of steadily increasing competition.
''We believe we have shaped a quality programme offering people a
chance to acquire more knowledge and better skills,'' said Sue Lindsay,
deputy director of Glasgow Opportunities and head of operations. ''The
people who take part in these courses will be able to help improve their
businesses and develop their human resources and their planning
processes.''
The programme, heavily subsidised by the sponsors so that the
individual fee of #550 for each course is reduced to #100 plus VAT, will
be held at the Glasgow Opportunities training centre in West George
Street, Glasgow. About 120 executives are expected to take part, mainly
owner-managers or key personnel.
The first programme, taken over three days and beginning on September
11, is on Human Resource Development Audit. Programme two, dealing with
Business Planning to Aid Survival, Development and Growth, commences on
October 4 and is over four days. The third programme, also over four
days, considers Sourcing and Recruiting Quality People and begins on
October 16, running into November. The final programme, a three-day
consideration of Performance Management, begins on November 20.
''Those taking part will be asked to provide in-depth information in
advance so that we can be sure everyone involved obtains the maximum
benefit,'' said Sue Lindsay. ''We will ask them to tell us how their
individual companies operate at the moment and their reasons for wanting
to come on the programme.
''We began planning the programme at the end of last year. We hope
that people who complete it will be able to return to their firms and
put into operation what they have learned. They will all be people able
to apply lessons to their own businesses.''
A strong number of early applications to the initial announcement of
the programme has included a number from local firms already taking part
in existing Glasgow Opportunities activities. But all participants will
take part on an equal footing.
''We believe that most of the firms concerned will have between 10 and
50 employees, firms who because of their present size may suffer from a
lack of specialised skills in human resource development,'' said Sue
Lindsay. ''Each will receive a certificate on completion of their
particular course or courses -- and we are emphasising that involvement
does not end there. We will offer back-up support afterwards should it
be required.'' Those taking part are expected to cover most of the
business spectrum from the mid-twenties age group onwards. Women
executives who hold managerial positions, and who may now be engaged in
setting up their own businesses, are expected to be among those who will
take advantage of the opportunity provided by the new Glasgow
Opportunities programme.
''The courses are for key decision makers in their respective firms,''
emphasised Sue Lindsay. ''Human resources development has changed
radically in recent years and there is much which can be learned.'' The
programme, set up at a funding of #35,OOO under the European Community
regional plan for Strathclyde, addresses a series of key training issues
regarded as vital to the future prosperity of small companies.
The Human Resources Development Audit course is intended to give
companies the skills to introduce a formal human resources strategy
including practical action plans for participant companies. It will
consider the tools of auditing, their use, and how to overcome possible
problems on the route to success.
The four-day course on business planning to aid survival, development
and growth is aimed specifically at executives who have input to the
long-term planning and decision making within their organisation. It
includes analysing a company's present position, identifying
opportunities and also identifying resources required.
Third in the series, Sourcing and Recruiting Quality People is
described as not merely an employment programme. It concentrates on
preparation work required for ensuring successful recruitment,
underlining that the quality of person recruited can aid the company's
future organisational direction and growth.
Last in the programme, Performance Management is aimed at the
maximisation of performance of all individuals in a company, from
defining the meaning of performance in a target team to an action plan
for implementation.
''All four courses are designed to be participative and practical,''
said Sue Lindsay. ''All are also designed to result in practical action
plans for the organisation represented.
''Don't regard this as just another training project. It is aimed at
owners or managers at executive level who want to achieve business
development including long-term change -- not just quick-fix
solutions.''

ROWING
THE 10-boat British team took only one medal from the World Junior
Rowing Championships in Posnan, a bronze in women's coxless fours, with
Scots Katrina Hastings and Isabel Walker aboard.
Two other British crews were unlucky not to join the girls' four on
the medal podium. Both the men's four and pair were overhauled just
short of the line to finish fourth by a few feet.
In both cases, these crews had raced the final with substitutes aboard
and afterwards it was clear that the British team coaches felt that they
had been robbed of medals by the appalling salmonella outbreak among the
teams.
In the girls' fours final on Saturday, the British crew had a solid
start and stayed with the leaders, Germany and Romania, all the way. By
halfway, good judgment had let them build up a lead over the rest of the
field to assure themselves of a medal. With the finishing line
approaching, the British girls attacked Romania for silver and at one
point looked capable of coming through, but they faltered a few strokes
short of the line and had to settle for bronze.
Later in the finals day programme, Hastings and Walker were joined by
George Watson's College clubmate Louise Fitzgibbon in the British eight
and won the B final of this event to rank seventh overall.

THE tug-of-war over world rugby has taken a new twist with allegations
that Springbok World Cup captain Francois Pienaar acted as a highly-paid
agent for media tycoon Kerry Packer in the fight to sign South African
players.
The claim was made by World Rugby Corporation director Ross Turnbull
in a Cape Town court hearing on Saturday, when the Packer-backed
organisation obtained an injunction temporarily barring the South
African Rugby Football Union from signing play-for-pay contracts with
Springbok players.
The WRC has been wooing 900 players world-wide to sign professional
contracts, but the tussle in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand
has an extra spice, with the national unions there having clinched a
10-year, #350,000m TV rights deal with Packer's media rival, Rupert
Murdoch.
Turnbull told the Cape Town hearing WRC was about to pay Pienaar
#200,000 for persuading the 27 other members of the World Cup squad to
sign letters of intent with his organisation.
But Pienaar reacted angrily to suggestions he made money out of the
arrangement, and said: ''I didn't even receive anything regarding my
expenses, and I had a lot of expenses.''
Meanwhile, New Zealand's stars said there was strong international
backing among players for a rebel professional circuit vying with rugby
unions for their signatures.
The All Black players said in a statement that at least half of their
World Cup squad had received better offers elsewhere -- presumably from
rugby league -- than those presented by the New Zealand Rugby Football
Union.

ATHLETICS
WITH a stirring victory in the final meeting, Aberdeen AAC captured
the Scottish Men's League title for the first time in their history at
Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh, yesterday.
The Granite City side did it in style, smashing their club record in
the final event, the 4 x 400 metres relay, which they won in 3min
19.42sec, anchored by former Commonwealth Games medallist Mark Davidson.
Former champions Edinburgh Southern, lying seventh and deep in the
relegation zone beforehand, pulled off a great escape to finish second
on the day and fifth overall. Ironically, capital rivals Edinburgh AC
were the ones to miss out, joining Falkirk Victoria in the drop.
Division 2 champions Clydesdale and East Kilbride will go up. Match
result:
Div 1 -- 1, Aberdeen AAC 370; 2, Edinburgh SH 331; 3, Scottish
Borders; 4, Inverness H 276; 5, Babcock Pitreavie 268; 6, Shettleston H

CYCLING
DERBY-born Max Sciandri scored a home victory on British soil when he
sprinted clear in the last four miles to score a solo win in yesterday's
145-mile Leeds International Classic.
Tour de France stage winner Sciandri, 28, who has a British racing
licence but is a member of Italy's Maglificio-MG team, crossed the line
44 seconds clear of his Italian breakaway companions Roberto Caruso and
Alberto Elli.
* NORTH Wirral Velo shaved two-and-a-half seconds off their own 1993
record when they won the 4000 metres team pursuit for the third
successive year during the British Cycling Federation national track
championships at Manchester on Saturday.
The quartet of Simon Lillistone, Paul Jennings, Chris Newton, and
Julian Ramsbottom clocked 4min 20.15sec to beat City of Edinburgh --
their closest rivals throughout the competition -- by more than eight
seconds.
Shaun Wallace, the new kilometre TT champion, beat his own British
500m flying-start record, clocking 27.984sec to take just over
one-and-a-half seconds off the figure he set in the United States in
1988.

FOOTBALL
EVERTON manager Joe Royle has dismissed reports that the transfer of
Andrei Kanchelskis from Manchester United has been called off.
The deal hit a hitch when United were stung by a demand from
Kanchelskis' previous club, Shakhtyor Donetsk, for a sixth of the #6m
fee.
Everton are still hoping the problem can be ironed out and the player
can start the new Premiership season with them after all.
For now, the 26-year-old Russian internationalist has been left in
limbo after having been paraded at Goodison by Everton, who agreed to
pay him #1.2m -- on top of his #13,000-a-week wages -- because he was
entitled to 30% of the fee.
United's solicitor Maurice Watkin explained: ''Andrei has not yet
played for Everton, and he's not in a position to play for them, because
he's not an Everton player.
''There is no animosity between United and Everton but, unfortunately,
we have not been able to do a deal that is satisfactory to Manchester
United.''
* MIDDLESBROUGH may give club-record signing Nick Barmby, bought for
#5.25m from Tottenham Hotspur, his first outing during their Scottish
pre-season tour.
Assistant manager Viv Anderson said: ''Barmby will not play against St
Johnstone on Monday night, but he could join us for games against Hibs
and Motherwell.''

Dundee United 2, Dundee 1
DUNDEE United yesterday gave themselves a pre-season boost for their
first-division campaign with this success against city rivals Dundee in
a benefit match for long-serving Tannadice midfielder, Dave Bowman.
The player emerged some #50,000 better off, although not all of the
United faces were full of smiles afterwards, such was the disappointment
felt after an injury scare.
Striker Scott Crabbe lasted just 38 minutes before limping off with
what was later confirmed as a hamstring injury which could place his
availability in question for this weekend's league opener against Morton
on Tayside.
Nevertheless, yesterday's derby was all about Bowman, and how the home
support responded to their opportunity of saluting a player who has
never offered less than 100% throughout his stay at Tannadice.
''Too often these games turn out to be too friendly,'' said Bowman,
''taking away any of the competitive edge. Happily, this city derby was
not one of those games.''
The near-5000 crowd loved every minute of the see-saw affair, and
while United manager Billy Kirkwood was delighted with some aspects of
his side's play and upset as to the possible loss of Crabbe, his overall
assessment of the game was one of optimism.
''Such derby affairs between the clubs always have that nice bit of
edge to them and this was no different,'' he said. ''The fact that we
came out on top delights me, especially as it gave us an opportunity to
blood so many youngsters.''
One of the young men mentioned by Kirkwood was Paul Walker, a
pint-sized 17-year-old who looks to have a fine future. He was a
surprise inclusion recently in United's warm-up trip to Finland, and
came out of that experience with flying colours.
It was from good individual work by Walker that United edged their
victory five minutes from the end, when the little man squared the ball
to the unmarked Craig Brewster, who prodded his winner home from eight
yards.
Earlier, a series of slack finishes by George Shaw and Paul Tosh were
balanced out on the half-hour mark when Shaw provided the ammunition for
Tosh to put Dundee in front.
But the visitors' joy was short-lived, as it took United only two
minutes to level matters, Crabbe lining one up for Grant Johnson to
finish from 10 yards.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, Gray, McBain, Mitchell, Craig, Johnson,
Bowman, McKinlay, Crabbe Brewster, Gilmour. Substitutes -- Walker,
Connolly.
DUNDEE -- Mathers, Bain, Cargill, Tully, J Duffy, Matheson ,Tosh,
Vrto, Shaw, Hamilton, Anderson. Substitutes -- McGhee, Britton.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).
* IF THE United supporters perhaps watched the emergence of a new
talent in Paul Walker, they may have seen Brian Welsh in United's
colours for the last time, with the defender expected to join Barnsley
today in a #350,000 deal.
Welsh, also wanted by Tranmere, travelled south yesterday to talk over
personal terms after United accepted the English club's offer.
''Brian has made it clear that he wasn't happy about staying with us
and turning out in the first division in the new season,'' said manager
Kirkwood. ''We have said all along that if other clubs made offers for
any of our players we would give them due consideration. The directors
have done this in Brian's case and have agreed to what we consider to be
a good offer.''

Rennie McOwan finds similarities with his homeland as he treks towards
the Arctic Circle
IT is initially just like home with names like Grampian, Highland,
Dodds, James I Land (they meant James VI) and even Englishman's Cove
although a shimmering blue sea backed by endless rows of serrated and
shining blue and white mountains and snow buntings as common as sparrows
told of a different scenario.
There is just about one polar bear for each person and a wee school
has a fence around it, not to keep children in as one Scottish pupil
said to me on a home visit, but to keep any maverick bears out.
This is Spitsbergen, 600 miles from the North Pole, the largest island
in an area called Svalbard, an archipelago of glaciers, snow capped
peaks, dusty summer moraine and a light so intense and clear that
scientists specifically go there to study that alone.
Here is a land of reindeer, Arctic fox, walrus, bearded seal, ringed
seal, the less common harp seal and many northern birds. About 60% of
the landmass is covered in ice or permanent snow and about another 30%
is sparsely vegetated, but in season there is an amazing variety of wild
flowers and lichen.
It is a land of two seasons when there is 24 hours of daylight,
running from April to the end of August and then, gradually, 24 hours of
continuing darkness takes over. The seas freeze and the polar winter
sets in.
But at any time Spitsbergen is hard and beautiful and even in summer
the glaciers are only a short stroll up the glen from the main community
or ''capital'' called Longyearbyen where a coal mine attracts young
families on short term and renewable contracts. It is the most northerly
community in the world. They seem very happy, perhaps because the more
rural the area in Norway, the less tax you pay. There is no crime.
Everyone seems to have a skidoo, a motorised sledge for winter or a car
for the short, dusty tracks around the settlement in summer.
There are no pensioners, the children are bursting with chronic health
and the 1000-strong mining community are playing their part in building
up sensitive and environmentally friendly tourism to the area.
Spitsbergen is Norwegian territory although there is a Russian and
Ukrainian community at another mine several miles away, beneath a
triangular shaped mountain called Pyramiden, but the whole Svalbard
area, about the size of Ireland, is controlled by international treaty
such is its environmental importance. Norway was granted full
sovereignty over Svalbard in 1925 and the treaty was signed by 42
countries. It states that the islands may not be used for military
purposes and ''development'' is closely controlled.
Spitsbergen is just about as far north as ordinary mortals can go
before hitting the North Pole and I still treasure two purple coloured
stones I picked up in a snow and ice covered area of intense quiet,
where the only sound on the edge of a slowly moving glacier was the
movement of ice flows and of water under great sheets of ice.
Polar bears pose an occasional problem. They rarely come into the
Longyearbyen settlement, but schoolchildren are taught that if they
encounter one they should throw down their schoolbag and then make a run
for it.
The bear -- called ice bears by the Norwegians -- will stop to sniff
it. The fleeing child can then throw off an anorak and so on. The bears
are protected, but can be shot if dangerous. Trekking groups going far
afield must have one person with a rifle.
The climate is obviously severe in winter and we found that in summer
it was mainly like a warm October day in Scotland. There is a lovely,
clear crispness in the air. Consult in advance over gear and clothing,
including snow goggles.
About 20,000 people each year visit Spitsbergen, mainly on brief
visits from summer cruise ships and Longyearbyen has an international
airport. Getting there can be expensive.
Visitors can sail, walk, ski, bird watch, horse ride, dog sledge,
fossil hunt or climb. Trekking can be by skiddoo or by husky sledge.
Longyearbyen has shops, a church, community centre, restaurant and
cafeteria and hostel-style accommodation for visitors. There is a small
and exposed camp site. The houses are built on piles above the frozen or
wet ground.
It is not uncommon for visitors to Spitsbergen to concentrate their
activities on Longyearbyen and then to make arrangements to return and
then to push on into wilder terrain. It is possibly the most accessible
now of the last great wildernesses, but such are the environmental
controls and the sensitive hand of tourism management and the great
scale of snow and ice wastes that Spitsbergen and the region as a whole
should always remain truly and magnificently wild.
Norway has many associations for Scots, the historic attempts at
alliance marriages, Lochlan of the Celtic legends, the Scots in
exploration or whaling expeditions (hush), the war time links when
Norwegians based in Scotland on their national day had the right to walk
in procession down Edinburgh's Princes Street (a ceremony which still
takes place), the wartime agents sailing by fishing boat from Shetland,
many to face a cruel death.
Two other gloriously attractive Norwegian sites can be linked with
going to Spitsbergen, the university city of Tromso (pronounced Tromsa),
the Gateway to the Arctic, from where many Polar expeditions set out and
where the great Amundsen lived, and the spectacular Lyngen Alps.
Norway is like a greater Scotland, the mountains are higher, the woods
more extensive and the moors wilder. An old Norse legend says the gods
practised building mountains in Assynt, in Sutherland, and then went off
to Lochlan (the old name for Norway and Scandinavia) and created the
bigger mountains there.
Tromso has a graceful bridge which crosses the fiord which divides the
city and puts the Skye bridge to shame. Elsewhere the fiord is crossed
by tunnel. The city buzzes with life, has a superb museum, an evocative
polar museum, a teaching hospital and a great night life. It is hard,
sometimes, to realise that it is within the Arctic Circle and a jump-off
point for Spitsbergen.
Into the foothills of the Lyngen Alps come the Sami people, part of
the great Lap races, with their huge reindeer herds. They can be visited
by tourists, again with care and sense. After a long hill trek I and
friends met the Sami people, ate reindeer and berry stew from wooden
plates and slept on deer skins beside an open fire in a Sami tent. I
still look with affection at two scorch marks on my jersey. A woman sang
a traditional yoiking song, which is often directed at the character of
a person, and baked home-made bread over an open fire. The smoke of a
fire inside a tepee-style tent does indeed go out through a hole at the
top. The singing was like a traditional Gaelic song.
Most Norwegians speak English, but will be very helpful if you rightly
try and learn some Norwegian. ''To Noroway, to Noroway, to Noroway o'er
the fame'', said the royal instructions to Sir Patrick Spens in an
ancient Scottish ballad and although all of that beautiful country is
worth a visit Spitsbergen is the jewel in the crown.
But feel at home. I noted the following words in Norwegian: Stanes,
kirk, bairn, cleg, brae, flitting, hus (house), mus (mouse). If you want
to help your hosts clean your hostel or guest-house then just ask for
the stoor-sooker (stovsuger). That's a vacuum cleaner.

MISTER Westsound has been threatening to win all summer, coming close
five times in succession, but when he eventually romped home at Ayr on
Saturday Linda Perratt's three-year-old almost lost it in the stewards'
room.
Young apprentice jockey John Bramhill was undoubtedly culpable when he
allowed Mister Westsound to barge into stable companion Diet at the
furlong pole setting off a chain reaction of bumping which involved the
7-2 favourite, Pageboy, and strongly fancied Ned's Bonanza.
Mister Westsound (14-1) went on to win so easily that the stewards,
after long deliberation, decided he had won on his own merit and allowed
him to keep the race.
Bramhill, who had travelled from Tamworth for the ride, was not so
fortunate.
He was given an eight-day ban -- four for carless riding and four for
excessive use of the whip -- which will run from August 14 to 22.
It was Perratt's sixth winner of the season and she was delighted
Mister Westsound had won despite colliding with Diet.
''Diet was cantering at the time and probably would have come close
but for the bump. Mister Westsound has been knocking on the door and
deserved to win. He is always slowly out of the stalls and likes running
through other horses at the finish,'' explained the Cree Lodge trainer.
The #5250 Star Form Handicap Stakes was Mister Westsound's first
attempt at six furlongs and Miss Perratt may keep him at that distance.
His only other success was as a two-year-old at Edinburgh 12 months ago.
Walk The Beat, who was beaten half-a-length by Diet at Hamilton Park
on Thursday night, was again runner-up. All the horses in the pile-up,
apart from the winner, failed to make the frame.
John Dunlop's Arundel yard is in tremendous form, with five winners on
Saturday at Newmarket, Redcar, Haydock, and a double at Ayr.
Beauchamp King (8-13) had four lengths to spare over Emperegrine in
the Barassie Median Auction Maiden Stakes, but the one that really
caught the eye was Never Explain (8-13), an easy winner of the Seafield
Maiden Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter.
Arctic Charmer failed to complete a stable hat trick when going down
by six lengths to Claireswan in the Portland Amateur Riders' Handicap.
The Dunlop horses made the 11-hour journey from Sussex overnight on
Thursday to avoid the heat and give them time to settle in.
The stewards inquired into the improved performance of 6-1 shot
Caltha, who made all to win the Old Prestwick Selling Handicap.
They accepted the explanation of Peter Calver that the three-year-old
filly, ninth at Edinburgh a week ago, ran better when ridden in front.

CALL a racehorse Flash and he'll hardly lift a leg, but name him
Depreciate and you are on to a winner.
A pessimistic title has done nothing to damage the fortunes of Charles
James' Beveled colt, who is now unbeaten in two starts.
Depreciate was an unconsidered 33-1 outsider for his debut in a
Goodwood maiden back in June, with juveniles trained by John Dunlop and
Mick Channon dominating the market.
However, the betting counted for nothing as Depreciate -- always
holding a prominent pitch -- was driven to a head success over Navigate.
Punters did not make the same mistake for his second outing as he was
sent off the 11-4 market leader for a conditions race over six furlongs
at Chester last month, and did not disappoint.
Always at the head of affairs under Ray Cochrane, Depreciate galloped
on well under pressure inside the final furlong to repel the challenge
of Amaniy by a head.
After the race, his trainer voiced the opinion that Depreciate would
have won by further had he not continually looked across at the crowd.
That might be an optimistic interpretation of events but there is no
doubt that Depreciate is a colt with plenty of ability, who is going the
right way.
The conditions he encounters at Windsor today should prove ideal and
Depreciate can maintain his unbeaten record in the SMS Conditions
Stakes.
Gary Milligan looks an apprentice with a future, and will be in
evidence much more as a result of having recently joined Geoff Wragg's
powerful Newmarket yard.
Today Milligan partners Out On A Promise for Wragg and the combination
have a good chance of landing the Shadwell Stud Apprentice Series
Handicap.
A reproduction of his second to Pursuit of Glory at Newmarket -- his
first attempt at a mile-and-a-quarter -- should see him go very close.
The Queen's Carpathian, who acts on both turf and all-weather
surfaces, can win his fourth race of the season in the Bollinger
Champagne Challenge Series Handicap over an extended mile and three
furlongs.

The communications company, who secured a #425,000 three-year Leger
sponsorship two years ago, have run into financial difficulties.
They have abandoned their London base, leaving no forwarding address
and principal shareholder Godfrey Anderson is the subject of a
bankruptcy petition filed in the High Court on April 4 and due to be
heard on September 13 -- the week after the Leger.
Doncaster racecourse reported earlier this year that the first year's

An official statement said a replacement sponsor in being actively

FRANKIE Dettori, injured in a fall at Haydock on Saturday, has been
discharged from hospital after having been detained overnight.
The jockey was taken to Warrington General Hospital with concussion
after being thrown to the ground when the John Gosden-trained Wainwright
suffered a fatal injury in the day's feature, the Group 3 Rose of
Lancaster Stakes.
Dettori was kept in for observation through the night but a
spokeswoman for the hospital said yesterday: ''He was admitted with a
slight head injury but was discharged this morning. He has a slight
injury to his right elbow, which will be followed up at his local
hospital.''
Matty Cowing, the champion jockey's agent, added: ''Frankie is flying
back to Newmarket this morning and he has a slight headache. According
to the rules he will miss the next seven days.
''John Gosden said he had never seen a horse break a leg in that
place, and the first thing to hit the ground was Frankie's head.''
Under Jockey Club regulations, a rider can be ruled out for periods of
seven or 21 days after suffering from concussion.
The longer ban would see him miss the Ebor meeting at York, which
starts on August 15.
Dettori had a winner at Haydock which took taking his seasonal tally
to 159 -- still well clear of nearest challenger Jason Weaver as he
chases his second title.
Wainwright -- owned by Sheikh Mohammed -- had to be destroyed on the
course.

DONCASTER racecourse yesterday announced that TeleConnection
Cellular's sponsorship of the St Leger has been terminated.
The communications company, who secured a #425,000 three-year Leger
sponsorship two years ago, have run into financial difficulties.
They have abandoned their London base, leaving no forwarding address
and principal shareholder Godfrey Anderson is the subject of a
bankruptcy petition filed in the High Court on April 4 and due to be
heard on September 13 -- the week after the Leger.
Doncaster racecourse reported earlier this year that the first year's
sponsorship payments have yet to be paid.
An official statement said a replacement sponsor in being actively
pursued.

AN inspired display from openers Amir Hanif and Greg Williamson helped
Clydesdale to a comfortable victory over Ferguslie in the final of the
West League Cup at Titwood yesterday.
The pair put on an opening wicket stand of 69, with Hanif eventually
making 45. It was this steady run-rate which was the key to victory.
Ferguslie lost opener Ian Kennedy in the second over after the restart
before brothers Stewart and Mike Pawson both went in the fourth, leaving
the visitors always behind in the chase.
Even an excellent 44 from Graeme Harper late in the innings could not
save them as the twin-pronged attack of Hanif, with five for 61, and
Williamson with three for 49, again proving their downfall.

NICK Fulwood and Heather Lockhart lifted the respective men's and
women's singles titles after hard-fought baseline battles at the Bank of
Scotland Scottish Hard Court championships at Dundee yesterday.
Fulwood, 31, showed glimpses of the form that took him to No.4 in the
British rankings six years ago as he dismissed Scottish No.4 Malcolm
Watt for the loss of just one game in Saturday's semi-final, but he was
made to work much harder for yesterday's 6-4, 6-4 win over hard-court
specialist Jason Barnett.
The 20-year-old Aberdonian, who had survived two match points as he
recovered from a 5-1 third-set deficit to upset title-holder Ken Wood
4-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the last four, pulled back from 5-2 down before
conceding the first set after 96 minutes, and threatened to cause an
upset as he established a 4-0 lead in the second. But he failed to
convert three game points on his service in the sixth game and the
Derbyshire coach drew on his experience to win six successive games to
clinch the #250 first prize.
World-ranked teenager Jennifer Duncan, who won the 21-and-under crown
on Saturday, looked set to add the women's title when she took the first
set 6-4 from Lockhart, but the Newlands player fought back to take the
next two 6-2, 6-4. Finals results:
Men: Singles: N Fulwood (Derbyshire) beat J Barnett (Ruthrieston) 6-4,
6-4. 21-and-under: Barnett beat S Crabtree (Nottinghamshire) 6-3, 6-2.

MILNGAVIE'S Tom McKeown smashed the course record at his home club in
the opening round of the Dunbartonshire Matchplay championship on
Saturday with an amazing nine-under-par 59.
The club champion broke the previous best mark of 64, which had not
been bettered for 27 years, by five strokes, and he added a one-over-par
69 to move six shots clear of Graham Smith, also of Milngavie.
McKeown reached the turn in 28, six under par, thanks to four birdies
and an eagle. He added three birdies on the inward half to break the
magic mark of 60. Leading aggregates:
128 -- T McKeown (Milngavie) 59, 69.
134 -- G Smith (Milngavie) 66, 68.

EAST LEAGUE
AS THE likelihood of the proposed amalgamation of the East and the
Scottish Counties increases, so does the pressure on the clubs
contesting the Ryden League to secure a top-five finish, since that
could be the simple yardstick for qualification to the top division of
the new set-up.
There will be no worries on that score for Heriot's, who clinched the
championship on Saturday with victory over Carlton. In doing so, they
set two records. They are the first side to record 12 consecutive Ryden
East League wins, and also the first to defeat every other side in the
course of their campaign.
This, however, was as tough a match as they have had to negotiate all
season because neither they nor their opponents played as well as the
glorious conditions warranted. Andy Macpherson opted to bat first and a
solid platform established by Bryn Lockie and Hugh Parker suggested that
a total in excess of 200 would materialise.
That it did not was down to the captaincy and steady bowling of Euan
McIntyre, so that Carlton never quite succeeded in taking control. Only
when Jim Govan and Scott Baker were in partnership did the bat dominate
the ball, but the nagging persistence of McIntyre induced errors and
only the powerful Baker reached 50. There were six 4s in his
half-century. McIntyre, bowling unchanged in tandem with Shahid Aslam,
finished with eight for 95.
A target of 186 from 48 overs looked well within Heriot's reach, but
they, too, ran into difficulty. Opener Steve Thomson was out of touch
and simply could not hit the ball off the square. In the event, he was
to hang around for 38 overs for the same number of runs, which threw a
lot of pressure on to Mike Allingham, whose 67 included eight 4s and a
straight 6 out of the ground -- and all this despite a groin strain
which had kept him out of the attack. Jim Love took over on Allingham's
departure and successive 6s over square leg kept Heriot's on course for
a win achieved with just two balls to spare.
Another side setting records were Freuchie, who logged the highest
score in league history with a whirlwind 321 off 48 overs against
visitors Stenhousemuir. Dave Cowan was the master butcher with 171 not
out, and the brothers Birrell provided terrific support with 78 not our
for Ross, and 60 for Scott.
Stenhousemuir also achieved some sort of record by becoming the only
side to score maximum batting points despite losing by more than a
hundred runs.
These two clubs are in the scramble for top-five security along with
Watsonians and Royal High, who met at Myreside, victory going to the
home side. Corstorphine lost ground and almost the match at Union Park,
where Edinburgh Academicals failed by one wicket as the last home pair
survived the final three tense overs. Aussie Craig Symon had 68 runs and
five wickets for Accies.
One wicket again was all there was in it at Raeburn Place, where
another superb knock of 133 by Gordon McGurk and an Alex Davies
half-century put Grange very much in the driving seat against Falkland,
but the Fifers' last pair were still together at the finish.

STEFFI Graf has pledged to take control of her own financial affairs
following the arrest of her father in a tax probe which also targets
her.
Graf, speaking on German television, revealed: ''I made the mistake of
not taking care of financial matters and will take the consequences for
that. In the next few days I shall make some important decisions and
take over full responsibility.''
Her father, Peter, who played a leading role in looking after the
financial affairs of the world No.1, was arrested on Wednesday on
suspicion of tax evasion.
German news magazine Der Spiegel said in a report released ahead of
publication on Monday that his arrest warrant cited a figure of around
#1m in unpaid tax. But the magazine claimed investigators believe this
figure could rise to more than #4.7m by the time they finish their
inquiry.

The unseeded 20-year-old overcame Frenchman Frederic Vitoux 7-6, 5-7,

Maclagan, who had never been beyond the second round of a Challenger

having disappointed his home crowd, who willed him to fight back when he

was no match for the determined Spaniard, who won 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6,
6-4.

WESTERN UNION
CLYDESDALE reasserted themselves at the top of the DM Hall Western
Union with a convincing 61-run victory over Kilmarnock NK at Titwood on
Saturday, and it will now take a collapse in the closing three weeks of
the campaign to prevent Scott Weir's men lifting the title for the first
time since 1980.
It seems quite incredible that one of the league's strongest and most
organised clubs have endured such a long wait for what will be their
thirteenth championship, but on the evidence of their latest triumph,
they will soon have cause to celebrate.
The home side batted first and they had Rennie Keith to thank for
allowing them to post a respectable score of 222 for four. Keith hit two
6s and eight 4s in his unbeaten 106.
He received staunch support from Scotland internationalist Greig
Williamson, who made 47, and from Weir, his captain, who joined him for
the closing overs and finished 33 not out.
Kilmarnock relied almost entirely on the prodigious batting skills of
Test star Asif Mujtaba, but even his genius was not sufficient to save
the game. Mujtaba struck thirteen 4s in an innings of supreme control,
but he finally departed for 107, run out as he attempted to take as much
of the strike as possible because he was running out of partners.
Clydesdale's professional, Aamir Hanif, has impressed more frequently
with the bat in his first season at Titwood, but on Saturday he proved
he can be equally effective with the ball. As the visiting batsmen
laboured, Hanif picked up four for 42 and Kilmarnock were all back in
the pavilion for 161.
The desire for revenge was evident, but not satisfied in two of the
day's other matches, as the four teams who had contested the Whyte &amp;
Mackay Scottish Cup semi-finals the previous Sunday were pitched
together on league business.
At Hamilton Crescent, Poloc needed to reverse the result of their
cup-tie if they were to capitalise on their Union win over Clydesdale a
week ago. Victory then raised hopes that they might yet catch the
leaders, but now they have had their chances of success in both
competitions dashed by West in near identical circumstances.
Just as they had done so in the cup, Poloc batted first. There is not
much left to say about the magnificent Sajid Ali, and this was one of
his most imperious performances. He eventually was just two runs short
of his own Union record, but he totally dominated the Poloc innings with
183 not out, peppering the Partick environs with seven 4s and no fewer
than eleven 6s.
Courtesy of Sajid's magical striking, Poloc set a target of 272 for
six. West set off in pursuit, and openers Mark Harper and Alastair
Storie put on 228 for the first wicket. Storie was out for 95, but
Harper continued to a deserved century, top-scoring for the hosts with
139. With that foundation, despite losing one more wicket, West hit the
winning runs with seven balls to spare, exactly as they had done the
previous Sunday.
Drumpellier had earned the right to meet West in the Scottish Cup
final when they overcame Ayr, and although they did not enjoy home
advantage second time around, they too repeated the dose. Scotland
opener Bruce Patterson, made an aggressive 66 and Alan Simpson
contributed 52 as Ayr reached 185 for eight.
Drew Pryde was the pick of the Coatbridge side's bowlers, with four
for 35.
Yet again, it was the evergreen Peter Campbell who guided Drumpellier
to full points. He defied the home attack to make an undefeated 62 and
when seven runs came off the penultimate over, it took just a single off
the next ball to complete the job.
Greenock's recent fragility continued at Meikleriggs when they lost
heavily to Ferguslie. Kiwi professional, Mike Pawson, blasted out five
of the visiting batsmen as Greenock slumped to a meagre 124. The Paisley
men passed that total for the loss of only three wickets.
Despite skipper Mark Watt's unbeaten knock of 82, Uddingston remain
bottom. The Bothwell outfit made 198 for six at home to Kelburne, but
they were overhauled with an over and one ball to spare.

STRUGGLING West Indies received another knockdown blow yesterday --
from a little-known county bowler who was once an England amateur boxing
international.
Paceman Kamran Sheeraz, 21, dismissed Brian Lara for nought and took
five for 41 in all as West Indies limped to 186 for nine against
Gloucestershire at Bristol. That made it 11 wickets in the match after
his six for 67 haul in the first innings.
Richie Richardson's side, desperate for form after their defeat in the
Old Trafford Test, are now only 189 runs ahead after their second poor
batting display of the weekend.
Another problem for West Indies, four days before the crucial fifth
Test in Nottingham, is that Carl Hooper looks unfit for combat because
of a right index finger still not properly healed after it was cracked
10 days ago. Hooper, who retired hurt on Saturday during his brief
innings of seven, did not appear until the fall of the sixth wicket
yesterday -- and then faced just 10 balls, making four, before being
caught off bat and pad at silly point.
Only a fiery spell from Kenny Benjamin, who took four for nought in
three overs to clean out the tail, prevented Gloucestershire from
earning themselves a first innings lead after fine batting from Andrew
Symonds and Tony Wright.
Opener Wright went on to 73 after Gloucestershire resumed on 137 for
two, and 20-year-old Australian Symonds underlined his huge potential
with a 47-ball half-century.
Leg-spinner Rajindra Dhanraj was taken for 18 runs in one over,
Symonds cutting him to the boundary, swinging the next ball over
mid-wicket for six and then sweeping the next to the square-leg ropes.
West Indian opener Stuart Williams, who may have to play in the Trent
Bridge Test if Hooper is unfit, top-scored for the second day running --
striking Sheeraz over the short cover boundary for six in an 89-ball 56
which also included eight 4s.

WESTERN UNION
CLYDESDALE reasserted themselves at the top of the DM Hall Western
Union with a convincing 61-run victory over Kilmarnock NK at Titwood on
Saturday, and it will now take a collapse in the closing three weeks of
the campaign to prevent Scott Weir's men lifting the title for the first
time since 1980.
It seems quite incredible that one of the league's strongest and most
organised clubs have endured such a long wait for what will be their
thirteenth championship, but on the evidence of their latest triumph,
they will soon have cause to celebrate.
The home side batted first and they had Rennie Keith to thank for
allowing them to post a respectable score of 222 for four. Keith hit two
6s and eight 4s in his unbeaten 106.
He received staunch support from Scotland internationalist Greig
Williamson, who made 47, and from Weir, his captain, who joined him for
the closing overs and finished 33 not out.
Kilmarnock relied almost entirely on the prodigious batting skills of
Test star Asif Mujtaba, but even his genius was not sufficient to save
the game. Mujtaba struck thirteen 4s in an innings of supreme control,
but he finally departed for 107, run out as he attempted to take as much
of the strike as possible because he was running out of partners.
Clydesdale's professional, Aamir Hanif, has impressed more frequently
with the bat in his first season at Titwood, but on Saturday he proved
he can be equally effective with the ball. As the visiting batsmen
laboured, Hanif picked up four for 42 and Kilmarnock were all back in
the pavilion for 161.
The desire for revenge was evident, but not satisfied in two of the
day's other matches, as the four teams who had contested the Whyte &amp;
Mackay Scottish Cup semi-finals the previous Sunday were pitched
together on league business.
At Hamilton Crescent, Poloc needed to reverse the result of their
cup-tie if they were to capitalise on their Union win over Clydesdale a
week ago. Victory then raised hopes that they might yet catch the
leaders, but now they have had their chances of success in both
competitions dashed by West in near identical circumstances.
Just as they had done so in the cup, Poloc batted first. There is not
much left to say about the magnificent Sajid Ali, and this was one of
his most imperious performances. He eventually was just two runs short
of his own Union record, but he totally dominated the Poloc innings with
183 not out, peppering the Partick environs with seven 4s and no fewer
than eleven 6s.
Courtesy of Sajid's magical striking, Poloc set a target of 272 for
six. West set off in pursuit, and openers Mark Harper and Alastair
Storie put on 228 for the first wicket. Storie was out for 95, but
Harper continued to a deserved century, top-scoring for the hosts with
139. With that foundation, despite losing one more wicket, West hit the
winning runs with seven balls to spare, exactly as they had done the
previous Sunday.
Drumpellier had earned the right to meet West in the Scottish Cup
final when they overcame Ayr, and although they did not enjoy home
advantage second time around, they too repeated the dose. Scotland
opener Bruce Patterson, made an aggressive 66 and Alan Simpson
contributed 52 as Ayr reached 185 for eight.
Drew Pryde was the pick of the Coatbridge side's bowlers, with four
for 35.
Yet again, it was the evergreen Peter Campbell who guided Drumpellier
to full points. He defied the home attack to make an undefeated 62 and
when seven runs came off the penultimate over, it took just a single off
the next ball to complete the job.
Greenock's recent fragility continued at Meikleriggs when they lost
heavily to Ferguslie. Kiwi professional, Mike Pawson, blasted out five
of the visiting batsmen as Greenock slumped to a meagre 124. The Paisley
men passed that total for the loss of only three wickets.
Despite skipper Mark Watt's unbeaten knock of 82, Uddingston remain
bottom. The Bothwell outfit made 198 for six at home to Kelburne, but
they were overhauled with an over and one ball to spare.

SCOT Miles Maclagan captured his first major international title when
he won the #84,000 ATP Challenger tennis event in Istanbul yesterday.
The unseeded 20-year-old overcame Frenchman Frederic Vitoux 7-6, 5-7,
6-2 to earn a pay cheque of around #9500.
Maclagan, who had never been beyond the second round of a Challenger
event, needed two hours and 56 minutes to see off his opponent, a 6-2,
6-2 semi-final winner over another Briton, Tim Henman. He can expect to
climb from 251 to around 180 on the world rankings.
* ALBERTO Costa of Spain caused one of the biggest upsets of the
season yesterday by beating clay-court supremo Thomas Muster in the
Austrian Open final.
Costa, seeded fifth, clinched the first tournament triumph of his
career.
No.1 seed Muster, the French Open champion, looked crestfallen after
having disappointed his home crowd, who willed him to fight back when he
was two sets to one down. He picked up an easy fourth set but in the end
was no match for the determined Spaniard, who won 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6,
6-4.

STEFFI Graf has pledged to take control of her own financial affairs
following the arrest of her father in a tax probe which also targets
her.
Graf, speaking on German television, revealed: ''I made the mistake of
not taking care of financial matters and will take the consequences for
that. In the next few days I shall make some important decisions and
take over full responsibility.''
Her father, Peter, who played a leading role in looking after the
financial affairs of the world No.1, was arrested on Wednesday on
suspicion of tax evasion.
German news magazine Der Spiegel said in a report released ahead of
publication on Monday that his arrest warrant cited a figure of around
#1m in unpaid tax. But the magazine claimed investigators believe this
figure could rise to more than #4.7m by the time they finish their
inquiry.

EAST LEAGUE
AS THE likelihood of the proposed amalgamation of the East and the
Scottish Counties increases, so does the pressure on the clubs
contesting the Ryden League to secure a top-five finish, since that
could be the simple yardstick for qualification to the top division of
the new set-up.
There will be no worries on that score for Heriot's, who clinched the
championship on Saturday with victory over Carlton. In doing so, they
set two records. They are the first side to record 12 consecutive Ryden
East League wins, and also the first to defeat every other side in the
course of their campaign.
This, however, was as tough a match as they have had to negotiate all
season because neither they nor their opponents played as well as the
glorious conditions warranted. Andy Macpherson opted to bat first and a
solid platform established by Bryn Lockie and Hugh Parker suggested that
a total in excess of 200 would materialise.
That it did not was down to the captaincy and steady bowling of Euan
McIntyre, so that Carlton never quite succeeded in taking control. Only
when Jim Govan and Scott Baker were in partnership did the bat dominate
the ball, but the nagging persistence of McIntyre induced errors and
only the powerful Baker reached 50. There were six 4s in his
half-century. McIntyre, bowling unchanged in tandem with Shahid Aslam,
finished with eight for 95.
A target of 186 from 48 overs looked well within Heriot's reach, but
they, too, ran into difficulty. Opener Steve Thomson was out of touch
and simply could not hit the ball off the square. In the event, he was
to hang around for 38 overs for the same number of runs, which threw a
lot of pressure on to Mike Allingham, whose 67 included eight 4s and a
straight 6 out of the ground -- and all this despite a groin strain
which had kept him out of the attack. Jim Love took over on Allingham's
departure and successive 6s over square leg kept Heriot's on course for
a win achieved with just two balls to spare.
Another side setting records were Freuchie, who logged the highest
score in league history with a whirlwind 321 off 48 overs against
visitors Stenhousemuir. Dave Cowan was the master butcher with 171 not
out, and the brothers Birrell provided terrific support with 78 not our
for Ross, and 60 for Scott.
Stenhousemuir also achieved some sort of record by becoming the only
side to score maximum batting points despite losing by more than a
hundred runs.
These two clubs are in the scramble for top-five security along with
Watsonians and Royal High, who met at Myreside, victory going to the
home side. Corstorphine lost ground and almost the match at Union Park,
where Edinburgh Academicals failed by one wicket as the last home pair
survived the final three tense overs. Aussie Craig Symon had 68 runs and
five wickets for Accies.
One wicket again was all there was in it at Raeburn Place, where
another superb knock of 133 by Gordon McGurk and an Alex Davies
half-century put Grange very much in the driving seat against Falkland,
but the Fifers' last pair were still together at the finish.

CLYDE manager Alex Smith hopes to be able ''in a few days'' to
announce developments regarding the club's attempt to take Celtic's
former internationalist striker Charlie Nicholas to Broadwood.
Smith had made an appeal for business enterprises in the Cumbernauld
area to come up with offers of sponsorship to help lure the star.
From a financial point of view, however, the club certainly were not
helped by Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by East Stirlingshire. With the
prize being a second-round tie at home to Dundee, Clyde may have lost
revenue in the region of #15,000.
On Saturday's evidence Clyde badly need a midfield general. It is the
kind of role Nicholas might well revel in, given that he would have more
time on the ball at this lower level. But if that hoped-for signing
falls through, Smith will have to look elsewhere for a playmaker.
Clyde went a goal up after 12 minutes on Saturday when striker Eddie
Annand ran on to a pass and lobbed the keeper. But from the half-hour
onwards, in Smith's words, ''we shot ourselves in the foot.'' Mark
Abercromby wheeled and shot in low from all of 35 yards and, six minutes
from the break, he converted a penalty after Keith Knox had upended Mike
Geraghty.
Abercromby could become an example of one of those players who step
down a grade before embarking on a revival. According to 'Shire manager
Billy Little, the former Airdrie man has a tendency to be a bit casual
and the player later admitted that fault when he talked to reporters.
Little explained that his side had paced themselves well in the heat.
As Smith said, Clyde wasted their advantage early on when a second goal
might have killed off the visitors.
* THE revised draw for the second round of the Scottish Coca-Cola Cup
(ties to be played Saturday, August 19) is:
Aberdeen v St Mirren, Clydebank v Motherwell, Dunfermline v Stranraer,
Cowdenbeath v Dundee United, Raith Rovers v Arbroath, Queen of the South
v Falkirk, Kilmarnock v Dumbarton, Ayr United v Celtic, St Johnstone v
Livingston, East Stirlingshire v Dundee, Rangers v Greenock Morton,
Berwick Rangers v Partick Thistle, Hibernian v Stenhousemuir, East Fife
v Airdrie, Hearts v Alloa, Stirling Albion v Hamilton.

RANGERS took their European squad of players to Turnberry yesterday
with striker Ally McCoist still nursing a thigh strain he collected at
Broadwood in the closing minutes of the game against Clyde last week.
McCoist and English internationalist Trevor Steven have the only
injuries which the Scottish champions have to concern them as they
prepare for their preliminary-round clash with Cypriot side Anorthosis
Famagusta at Ibrox on Wednesday, writes Ken Gallacher.
It would be unlikely if midfielder Steven would be featuring in the
game -- because of the three foreigners' rule which still blights the
Rangers' squad when they head into Europe.
McCoist, though, is a different matter. That is why he was at Ibrox
for treatment on Saturday and again yesterday as the backroom staff
attempt to have him ready.
His goals pre-season have confirmed that he is ready for another Euro
challenge and, of course, the game against the champions of Cyprus will
provide him with the platform to rack up his 300th competitive goal for
the Ibrox club.
Manager Walter Smith said yesterday: ''We have to take a look at both
players before the game on Wednesday. At the moment, I have the team I
want to play already in my mind. We know what we have to do here, after
all.''
What Rangers must do is attempt to kill the tie at home in front of
their own huge support this week. To do so they will rely on three
foreign players -- Paul Gascoigne, Brian Laudrup, and Mark Hateley -- as
well as their Scottish stars.
But they recognise that last season Anorthosis beat Atletico Bilbao
2-0 in Cyprus before going out 3-2 against the Spanish side.
Rangers have watched the Cypriots five times over the past 10 days to
build up a dossier on the team which stands between them and a
Champions' League jackpot of around #8m.
* SCOTLAND'S youths cried tears of frustration last night after going
down 3-2 to England in the final of the Eight Nations' Tournament in
Sweden.
The Scots had taken an early two-goal lead through Dundee United's Jim
Paterson in 15 minutes and Alex Notman 10 minutes laster. However,
defensive mistakes let England in to equalise through Michael Owen and
Martin Jones. Owen snatched the winner near the end.
Coach Ross Mathie said: ''The boys were in tears because they believed
they could have won this tournament. But I pointed out we have done
well. We will be in the European Youth Championships later in the season
and this has been good experience for them.''

THE old order of athletics gave way to the new here last night in the
Ullevi stadium at the world championships.
The 100 metres demise of Britain's greatest champion, Linford
Christie, was matched by the departure of his arch-rival, Carl Lewis,
the obliteration of the USA as a sprint power, and of Kenya as masters
at 800m.
More remarkably, the long-jump reign of Heike Drechsler and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee was ended by a Briton, Fiona May. Unfortunately for UK
prestige, May defected to Italy, changing her allegiance almost two
years ago, citing lack of support in her home land.
But the most poignant and dramatic exit, almost certainly into his
much talked-of retirement, was the defeat of Christie. He dragged
himself painfully away, protected by the two women in his life.
His long-time girlfriend, Mandy Miller, supported his limping figure,
while his manager, Sue Barrett, attempted to shield him from TV cameras.
While Canada's Donovan Bailey snatched the 100m crown in 9.97sec,
sixth-hundredths ahead of his compatriot, Bruny Surin, Christie was a
remote sixth, in 10.12.
But this was no meek surrender. Injured during a semi-final, defending
champion Christie scorned the soft option of withdrawal, and so gained
as much respect by the manner of his exit than by any of the majestic
successes of his career.
Though some will argue that this was a championship too far for the
Olympic champion, and that Christie was a shadow of the man whose
imperial presence had dominated his event, I cannot agree.
Nor could John Smith. The former world 440 yards record-holder, who
coaches bronze medallist Ato Boldon and American Mike Marsh, who was
fifth, said: ''That is the most courageous thing I have seen him do on
an athletics track.'' But the omens were there when Christie could
finish only fourth in the semi, scraping into the final. ''Get me a
physio, quick,'' he pleaded.
But for all their ministrations, the 35-year-old Christie was betrayed
by his body, with no twenty-fourth major championship medal to soften
his abdication.
On crossing the line, he collapsed in pain on to the shoulder of his
friend, Frankie Fredericks, who had finished fourth.
Christie clung, briefly to the Namibian, then crashed, face down on
the track. But it would not swallow him.
Immediately the medics swarmed around, binding ice packs to the back
of his right knee and thigh. A stretcher was produced, but with a glare
at the bearers which would have frozen Medusa, he hirpled out on those
once flying feet.
It was the first time since Allan Wells won the sprint gold in 1980
that a world or Olympic 100m title had gone to someone other than
Christie or Lewis.
''If you have to go down, it is better to go down fighting,'' said
Christie. ''It would have haunted me for the rest of my days if I had
not gone out and run in that final.''
Going out in this fashion may, paradoxically, be the one thing which
may give Christie cause for second thoughts about his proposed
retirement. Bailey, well beaten by Christie last time they met, said:
''All I can say about Linford is that he is still a great champion, and
maybe he had a bad day. But I was the one to take it from him.''
In putting to rest the ghost of his compatriot, drug cheat Ben
Johnson, Bailey had just the merest wind assistance, at one metre per
second. The year's fastest man at 9.91, he is quick to point out that he
has been tested six times since he recorded that time in June.
Marsh's failure to place among the first three means the US have
missed a medal for the first time in the history of the event. And,
boycotts apart, for the first time since the 1976 Olympics.
Not since Mary Rand won Olympic gold in Tokyo 31 years ago has a
Briton won a major long-jump title. So it was all the more careless that
Britain did not more carefully husband the talents of May, the 1988
world junior champion.
She quit England after the 1993 worlds and married Italian pole
vaulter Gianni Iapachino.
Of the Italian set-up, she said: ''They pay me a salary, and I get on
with my training. When I was in Britain, I got nothing. I had to fight
for every penny. When I moved, my new coach made me much more confident.
It would have been impossible for me to have done this if I'd stayed in
Britain.''
Drechsler, the defending champion, failed to make the top eight.
Joyner-Kersee, the only other woman to have held the title, was sixth.
May had opened with 6.93m -- good enough to win -- but made sure with
6.98m on the last, with a 4.3m-per-second wind helping her.
Mel Neef failed gloriously in her bid for a place in the women's 400m
final. She ran the fastest race of her life, 51.18sec, in strongly
gusting winds, and failed by just two-hundredths of a second to break
Linsey Macdonald's 15-year-old Scottish record.
''I should have had a go in the heat, on Saturday, when the wind was
much lighter,'' she said. ''If I had broken the record, I could have
borne not getting to the final a bit better.''
When the men's 800m final takes place tomorrow it will be a historic
race, notable for the absence of any UK or Kenyan runners for the first
time. Curtis Robb finished last in his semi-final yesterday, while
Scotland's European indoor 1500m champion, David Strang, did not survive
Saturday's opening round.
Robb attempted to dictate matters from the front. But he lacked
conviction, and was brushed aside. ''I should have gone eyeballs-out,''
reflected Robb. His time, 1-50.12, now may prompt him to revert to the
1500m for Atlanta.
''Maybe this points to me doing the 1500 next year,'' said Strang,
whose wife, Ginny, had flown here to watch him and was close to tears
after his demise.
Kenya's two-lap failure was made hard for them to bear when Wilson
Kipketer, a Kenyan who defected to Denmark, established himself as
favourite. He shared a dormitory in the Rift Valley school at St
Patrick's, Iten, with Kenya's No.1, Joseph Tengelei, who failed to reach
the final. They even shared the same desk.
A Kenyan not winning the world title? That'll be the Dane! In Kenya's
principal language, the stadium name, Ullevi, means alcohol. But the
Kenyans were not the only ones drowning their sorrows in ullevi last
night.

AS Washington continued to dig itself and President Clinton into a
deeper and deeper hole over US policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Glasgow was
quietly getting on with the job of enforcing the United Nations arms
embargo.
Scottish holidaymakers on the Greek island of Corfu were principally
concerned with topping up a tan before returning to work. They had no
notion, nor did they care, that just 50 miles north of them a flotilla
of 20 warships from several countries was engaged in arguably the only
successful operation the United Nations has managed throughout the
tragic civil war in former Yugoslavia.
Operation Sharp Guard, mounted by Nato and Western European Union
warships in the Adriatic, has ensured that the warring factions have
been denied replacement artillery pieces and tanks. No vessel has broken
the embargo and six have been caught in the attempt.
With total commitment and efficiency, a ''stick'' of six commandos
from 42 Royal Marines, armed with SA80s, were fast-roping from a Lynx
helicopter on to the deck of a suspect ship.
It was an extraordinary sight. Immediately one commando had left the
helicopter and grasped a dangling rope to slide on to the deck, the next
was preparing for his descent. At one time four of them were on a rope
only 50ft long.
Soon, the vulnerable helicopter was departing the scene. Soon enough?
The operation had lasted only 14 seconds but they should have done it in
12 to be sure of avoiding trouble.
The commandos took up defensive positions on the bow and prepared the
way for the next boarding party. Again it was from the air, but this
time it was made up of sailors from HMS Glasgow, also armed with SA80s
and Browning side arms.
Their fast-roping from the Lynx might not have been as rehearsed as
that of the marines, but their descent was equally effective. ''Just
another skill we have had to learn,'' said Lt ''Dusty'' Millar, in
charge of the boarding party.
Other seaman, who had taken to the water in rigid inflatable boats
(RIBs), were preparing to board the suspect vessel by scaling up its
starboard side.
Back in Corfu, holidaymakers were beginning to come to terms with the
fact that their special personal relationships, begun so promisingly two
weeks before, might not after all stand the test of time.
But they did not give a second thought to events north of them which
were leading to a possible fall-out of nations; nor to the state of the
special relationship Britain has long felt it enjoyed with the United
States. This was being stretched to the limit by votes in Washington, if
it was not already on the rocks.
The boarding had been an exercise; but sailors and marines from HMS
Glasgow, midway through her six-month deployment in the Adriatic, have
already boarded and searched 15 vessels in an operation intended to
ensure that weapons and other vital war supplies do not get past them
and into the hands of the combatants. The last had taken place the
previous day -- a ship from the Philippines carrying cars. Like every
other one, it was found to be clean.
HMS Glasgow has also diverted two ships to Brindisi in the south of
Italy for a more leisurely examination -- because containers were packed
too closely on one and and because, on the other, it was impossible to
determine that a bulk cargo of grain was not concealing a consignment of
weapons.
This is the largely forgotten sideshow in the rapidly escalating war
in the former Yugoslavia, and it is not always popular. Shipping lines
work on tight margins and the diversions are hugely expensive.
''I would say that 99% of the time the masters of boarded vessels have
co-operated fully, and I have yet to come across the few who won't,''
said Commander Tony Rix, commanding officer of HMS Glasgow. ''They know
we have a job to do and that we will do our best to ensure they are not
delayed any longer than necessary.
''This is probably the most tightly controlled water space in the
world. Nothing can get through the ring of Nato ships. We know exactly
who or what is moving at any one time.''
He knows, however, as does everyone else on the Type 42 guided missile
destroyer, that while the navies of the world can effectively police the
movements of ferries and container ships, speed-boats are plying a
constant trade between Italy and former Yugoslavia.
They travel too fast for the warships and, without resorting to
shooting them out of the water, there is little Nato navies can do
except plot their movements and report them to the Italian coastguard.
Nobody knows what is on board these small boats -- it could be any
kind of contraband. Cigarettes, someone suggested. However, you would be
naive in the extreme if you did not suspect that they were also carrying
small arms.
It is reckoned that about 50 of them are daily whizzing out of Italy
into Croatian and Montenegran waters. Mafia involvement is not ruled
out. It would be just as easy for these small blockade-busting boats to
be carrying a SAM missile, which could take out one of our aircraft, as
a consignment of Benson &amp; Hedges.
The threat is both obvious and serious, but one that the United
Nations is not prepared to take on board. The UN will not change the
mandate to allow the warships in the Adriatic to take drastic action.
As a consequence, the speed-boats are being allowed to ply their
illegal trade, whatever it is, even though the odds for those on the
ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina are getting worse as each day passes.
Adrenalin is running fast on the bridge as HMS Glasgow is ordered to
investigate yet another vessel. It turns out to be a Minoan Line ferry
whose captain, El Greco, is by now only too familiar with the sight of a
warship steaming towards him at a fast rate of knots.
''El Greco must be totally pissed off at being constantly
intercepted,'' a sailor observed. ''If you ask me it's those speed-boats
we should be after.''
Currently HMS Glasgow is operating in an area of sea in the Straits of
Otranto off Albania. Here the ship's company can go about their business
in a relatively relaxed atmosphere.
However, the destroyer has also been in operations further north, off
Montenegro, where Nato has set up a three-box guard line known as Tom,
Dick and Harry. It will also return there before the deployment is over.
In this area of the Adriatic the warships operate well within the
range of Styx missiles known to be in the possession of what was once
Yugoslavia. Nobody believes that the missiles would be fired at a Nato
warship, but they are not taking the risk. When in this area the ship
goes into a higher state of alert with the ship's company, working six
hours on and six hours off.
The 280 people on board have to carry anti-flash gloves and hoods with
them at all times. All in all, life becomes much more uncomfortable for
everyone.
Since the operation began, Nato and WEU warships have challenged
56,060 vessels, boarded and inspected 4355 ships at sea, and diverted a
further 2005 for inspection in port.
Enforcing an embargo is what the Royal Navy does best, one officer
observed. ''We learned the basic skills during the 30-year blockade of
the French. It was during that time that the Royal Navy developed its
wonderful traditions. They had nothing better to do then.''
A Scot feels perfectly at home on board HMS Glasgow.
The helicopter is called Mungo and passageways have been given city
street names.
The captain's quarters are just round the corner from the Gallowgate.
To get to the Naafi, first of all you have to find Sauchiehall Street.
The Chinese laundry is in Clyde Street.
However, all the officers on board are English and they are curious
about the tartan on their cummerbunds -- essential wear for supper in
the wardroom -- so naturally enough they ask the expert opinion of a
Scot. ''Glasgow?'' I suggest without total conviction.
Commander Rix is in no doubt that enforcing the embargo through
Operation Sharp Guard is vital. ''Not because it is the policy of the
Government,'' he says. ''I firmly believe that, if we were not here,
what is a tragic civil war would have been very much worse and many more
lives would have been lost.''

CONCERN has been expressed for a long time over the use of
organosphosphorus (OP) sheep dips, even though dipping is the
traditional, established, and proven technique to control external
parasites.
0 There are alternative measures, such as the use of pour-ons,
injectables, showers and sprays.
Consideration must therefore be given to minimise the risk to all who
come in contact with OPs and other dips and to protect the environment.
A certificate of competence is required by anyone wishing to buy OP
sheep dips. In preparation for tackling the written assessment,
participants are advised to attend a training course organised by SAC or
ATB Landbase.
Dip should be kept in its original container, properly labelled and
sealed, locked within a pesticide or veterinary medicines store. When
dippingwear wellington boots, waterproof leggings or trousers made of
PVC or Nitrile; bib apron or coat (PVC/Nitrile), gloves (non-lined
PVC/Nitrile, heavy duty gauntlet style 0.5mm thick and 300mm long) and a
face shield when handling the concentrate. If in doubt, consult the
Health &amp; Safety Leaflet AS29 (sheep dipping).
There are two legitimate methods of disposing of concentrate dip:
return to the supplier/manufacturer or to a registered waste disposal
contractor.
For spent dip, the waste disposal contractor is expensive, so most
farmers will spread it on fields after dilution with either water or
slurry, at a ratio of 3:1 (3 parts water or slurry to 1 part spent dip)
spreading at a rate of 20m[3] per ha (1775gall per acre).
Spreading should take place on a flat site, well-away from water
courses and sources, on a field of low ecological value and fenced, with
stock not grazing for at least a month. The ground should not be frozen
and there should be a reasonable depth of soil to absorb the dip.

HAIRST is here! The tender loving care with which we have pampered our
winter barley is paying off. And the invoice is arriving for all the
things we forgot to do or did too late.
Sadly, we seem to have made more mistakes than usual. The first few
fields, which looked so well, have been a bit of a disappointment.
Bushel weights are down and many of the grains are not much more than
swellings at the bottom of the awns.
And yet it looked so well. When the grain started to fill our hearts
perked up, and then soared. But it must all have been water. The fine
plump berries shrivelled in a few days and harvest was suddenly upon us.
The first confirmation that all was not well came when the Red
Rooster's 15 tonne cart only held 13 tonnes. And Crookie, who was
looking to save some seed, eyed his sample and calculated that he would
need his entire crop to dress out a suitable seeding.
Mossie was so depressed by his sample that he ordered his men to shut
the door of his big shed between loads in case the crop blew away. Mind
you, I think he may have been being a bit too cautious for his first
field did work out at 3 tonnes 8 cwts.
Against that background, and remembering that I am not allowed to be
better than Mossie, the Little Ardo crops are not doing too badly. But
it did come on quickly. I tried a sample on Saturday and to my
astonishment it read 14.6% moisture on two different meters.
Now that is perfection. The merchants hit you for drying charges,
shrinkage and a little bit for themselves if you go over 15%, so you
want it just below 15. If you go further below you just lose weight. And
worse than that, if you lose 2% of water it reduces your overall weight
by nearer 3%.
So up I went to see if Mains had the combine greased and ready.
He had, but he was going to start his own on Monday and would come to
Little Ardo about Wednesday. By that time my barley should be at 10% in
this heat wave. That would mean we would need to throw a tonne and half
of water into each artic load to make up the weight. Tricky times were
here it seemed.
But as Davie, the Man of Few Words who does most of our contracting,
says: ''Naething ripens crop like the sound of the contractor's phone.''
I begged Mains to come to me on Saturday and Sunday and return to his
own on Monday. Mains started two days early and came to me last Monday.
He had pulled out all the stops. He had even postponed his second cut
silage, which made the meter reading on our barley something of an
embarrassment. We couldn't get it below 19%. Where the samples we had
taken three days earlier came from, I just do not know.
Anyway, with young Ochyoch there too, with his combine, we did 32
acres in perfect conditions. The Farmer was tired by the end of the day,
for he had to cart to two combines.
I can't say what it yielded. It's not the 75 cwts I was looking for,
but I'm confident it's 60. And the good news is that the first load is
away to the merchants, where their meter said 16.5% and gave me a
respectable bushel-weight for Pleasante, of 61.7.
The bad news is that I'll have to keep quiet about it. Mossie has me
well warned that if I want him to stay on as honorary crops consultant
I'd better not beat him.
So I'll have to join in the general moan.
On the positive side, we have never seen so much straw. Mains got 176
bales off a 13 acre field. A few short years ago that would have just
meant so much more smoke giving farmers a bad name in the countryside.
But a few short weeks ago it was making #17 a bale in the electronic
auction at Thainstone; and that comes to almost #230 an acre.
There may not be such a scarcity of straw this year, but if you
believe reports from the rest of the country where silage yields have
been from reasonable to disastrous, and where wheat and spring barley
are dying on their feet before they are ripe, then 1995-96 could be even
better for straw.
Mind you, the farmer of Waterside seems to me to be taking his
optimism on winter fodder too far.
Watery is impressed by reports from England that maize silage crops
have failed, that there are few second cuts and no third cuts of grass
silage and that straw is short. He is seriously considering cutting and
baling his wheat, treating it with ammonia and selling it to the English
dairymen as a whole crop diet.
Anyway, I am trying to get the lads to take the view that if the
yields and bushell weights are down, so are the moistures. And if half
of what they say is true the straw will make up for any expectations
which are not met by the grain.
And if Watery's mad scheme to sell his wheat for fodder works, we can
get him to bring home a few cheap calves.
Incidentally, Watery has developed a new system for avoiding the blue
flashing lights when he goes home from the pub, which is neither early
enough nor often enough.
He leaves a gate to his newly ploughed field lying open. When the blue
lights start flashing he doesn't stop, nor does he try to race off. He
simply waits till he reaches the gate, nips down into four wheel drive
and in he goes. The squad car can't follow.
It has worked twice, but I fear I won't be able to tell you about the
next time. That is sure to be subjudice.

SCOTLAND'S new Agriculture Minister had his first official outing last
week at the Black Isle Show at Muir of Ord and did very well.
The Earl of Lindsay is a farmer himself, with responsibility for the
strategic management of 500 acres of arable and grass land at
Kilconquhar in Fife.
Educated at Eton and Edinburgh University, he is also a landscape
architect and environmental consultant by profession and, if his Black
Isle performance is anything to go by, a pretty smooth operator into the
bargain.
He was charm itself, indicating to the assembled farming journalists
that he favoured an open door policy and we should ''come up and see him
sometime''.
My experience is that all newly appointed ministers say that on first
acquaintance -- but the ever-open door soon closes. I don't think it's
anything personal, it's just that their diary becomes so overloaded that
even their nearest and dearest need an appointment weeks in advance.
Lord Lindsay told farmers at the show ''just call me Jamie''.
According to Who's Who his full name is James Randolph Lindseay-Bethune
and he is the 16th Earl. His pedigree obviously matches the best of the
champions brought out at Muir of Ord.
He seems to have decided to eschew any kind of gradual ''running in''
process and, without much prompting, was forceful in his remarks.
His predecessor, Sir Hector Monro, was fond of saying that changes in
the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy would come through a
process of evolution rather than revolution. That may be so, but Lord
Lindsay gives the distinct impression that under his regime the pace of
change is about to move up a gear or two.
Far from making reassuring noises about a little tidying up of loose
ends here and there, he was warning that the CAP cannot be preserved is
aspic for ever and a day. There was, he warned, an inevitability about
CAP reform and reductions in subsidies.
''I do not want any farmer to think that CAP will go on gloriously
into the sunset -- it is bound to change.'' He is certainly articulate
and a good communicator. I can see him being much in demand as a speaker
at dinners up and down the country.
First impressions are that farmers can rest assured he is on their
side. His remarks about outside agencies which are anxious to clip
farmers' wings and tell them what they can and cannot do will have
caused some concern within the likes of Scottish Natural Heritage and
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They will very quickly
want to put their case to the new minister.
He was equally frank in his assessment of what the farmers' reaction
should be to cuts in price support systems and the EU subsidy structure.
Money would be redirected into schemes designed to encourage
environmentally-friendly farming methods, he forecast -- ''and the
farmer wants to make sure that he is the recipient of these subsidies''.
The alternative would be control by voluntary agencies, which the
minister appeared to view with some disfavour.
He is strongly of the opinion that farmers have done a good job of
looking after the countryside and should be left in charge because they
know what they are about.
While his civil service minders might blanch at Lord Lindsay's
forthright expression of opinion, there are indications that he knows
when to be cautious. He would not be drawn into taking sides in the
current controversey over payment of royalties on farm-saved seed.
Agriculture as an industry had enough troubles fighting with opponents
on the outside, he said: ''The last thing we need is internal battles
between different parts of the industry.''
He was equally reluctant to cast his lot with tenant farmers in
Scotland who are still in dispute with British Coal over the conditions
of sale which it is seeking to impose on those of them who want to buy
their farms.
The issue was one between British Coal and the farmers involved, he
said.
The major banks have indicated an unwillingness to become involved in
financing the purchase of ex-British Coal farms because of the fear of
liability for future pollution risks.
The tenant farmers claim they always understood that British Coal --
or its successors -- would assume these risks -- but that is not spelled
out specifically in the conditions of sale. The farmers' legal advice is
that they should seek a warranty indemnifying them against future
liability.
British Coal has said that some ongoing responsibility would remain
with the new Coal Authority and the Department of Trade and Industry --
but that is not spelled out in the conditions of sale.
Officials tend to suggest that the tenant farmers' main interest is in
negotiating further reductions in the asking price, which has been a
bone of contention from day one.
It now appears that the banks are about to be targeted by British
Coal, which wants to convince them that, as the holders of security over
the land, they are not about to be held responsible under the new
environment legislation for future pollution.
The tenant farmers have waged a canny campaign to date. They may be
closer than they imagine to achieving the harmonious conclusion the
minister hopes for.

Music
ON paper it was a marriage made in heaven knows where. After a first
half of big-band charts, impeccably played but with a sense of
excitement that rendered the Radio 2 banners on stage an unnecessary
emphasis of the band's natural habitat, the picture was no clearer.
An optimist might have hoped for beauty and the beast fair of the Tom
Waits singing Somewhere variety. An optimist would have been
disappointed. But not completely. True, jazz standards such as How Long
Has This Been Going On? do not sound like Van Morrison's thing. And Who
Can I Turn To? was interesting chiefly for his valiant attempts to turn
it into his own vehicle.
The trouble was, the BBC chaps are superbly disciplined, as are
Morrison's -- but the latter get to breathe, and when the big band
relaxed into a groove such as on the more familiar Vanlose Stairway,
something like the real Morrison was allowed to come out to play.
Without delivering quite the Morrisonesque fervour, soloists such as
Derek Watkins (trumpet), Gary Cox (tenor saxophone), and Andy Vinter
(piano) entered at least into the Morrison spirit.
When it came to the inevitable Moondance, one Morrison song which
certainly has passed into the jazz repertoire, the band were queueing up
to solo as if they'd waited all their lives for the chance. Alas bassist
Roy Babbington, getting in first, rather spoiled it for the rest by
being unfollowable. With a terse thank you, Morrison was off.

JOANNE REWCASTLE reveals the sex secrets of the pest behind potato
blight
APPALLING, devastating, tragic . . . it was all of these and more. But
the Irish potato famine was also 150 years ago -- and it could never
happen again, could it? Maybe not, but the disease which caused such
human misery -- in Ireland and Scotland -- is far from being dead and
buried. In fact, it has only just discovered sex.
Rising potato prices in Europe testify -- in 1995 -- that the
wellbeing of the humble potato affects us today. Like so many Irish and
Scots last century, we need to cross the Atlantic, to Mexico, to become
aware of the modern threat of potato blight.
At the time of the potato famine, the ability of fungi to cause
disease was not known. The cause of the potato blight was linked to the
potatoes absorbing water and rotting through excessive rain or electric
energy absorbed by soils during storms. The horrid smell from the
rotting potatoes encouraged the belief that the disease was an act of
God, a biblical plague.
In 1848, the Reverend Berkeley identified the fungus Botrytis
infestans (Mont.) as the cause of potato blight. This fungus was renamed
Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary and became one of the classic
plant diseases of academic study.
The fungus invades and feeds on plant cells, killing them before
invading fresh tissue. In cool, wet conditions, spores of the fungus
emerge from infected leaves. The spores are mobile in water and spread
the disease by infecting both other leaves and the underground potatoes.
The discovery that the blight was maintaining a secret sex life in
Mexico (which soon spread to Europe) changed the whole view of the
disease. The fungus had survived, producing periodic blights, by
reproducing asexually.
Sexual reproduction required two opposite mating types which, up to
1980, had only been found together in Mexico. Recent reports of both
mating types occurring in Europe and the UK suggested that a sexual
cycle was possible. This has important implications for potato blight.
First, sex causes reshuffling of genes, resulting in the rapid formation
of new strains of the fungus which are more infective to potato plants.
Secondly, sexual reproduction leads to spherical structures called
oospores in diseased potato plants. Oospores survive in the soil during
winter and infect the next potato crop soon after it is planted.
In 1845 the combination of cooler and wetter weather in Ireland than
usual, and the widespread use of a single potato variety, created ideal
conditions for potato blight. Starvation resulted when blight infected
the potato crop and persisted for the next three years. Between 1845 and
1849, 1,000,000 people died in Ireland and 1,500,000 emigrated. In
Scotland, only the charitable intervention of the Free Church staved off
similar starvation in the Highlands.
Today, the undoubted improvement in social conditions and the wider
range of foods will no doubt prevent a return of famine here, or in
Ireland. Nevertheless, the threat of failure of the potato crop remains,
particularly with the possibility of sexual reproduction of the fungus.

Just having someone to talk to during a difficult period proves a
godsend for many children, as Giselle Dye discovers
TRICIA is 16. Within three minutes of meeting, she put the effect of
befriending bluntly. ''If Sheila wasn't here, I might not be here!''
Sheila, a student nurse who's just finishing her degree, has come along
to this interview with her. The power of Tricia's words produced a
momentary silence.
I check it out. Yes, she feels she might be dead. Befriending could
have saved her life, literally -- ''Having someone to talk to,'' says
Tricia who seems a shy quiet-spoken young woman, ''it's important.''
Tricia was being bullied at school so she was not attending. She was
being bullied in the street as well. Her mum and dad were rowing at home
and as the eldest of four daughters she and her mum were rowing. She has
been suicidal. No-one to talk to. The social worker was really for her
mum -- ''She didn't have time to listen to me. She would rush me.''
''I never realised the extent of Tricia's problem, to be honest,''
says Sheila when I ask about her lifesaving contribution. ''I just enjoy
being with her, going out.'' They go bowling, for example, Sheila
finishes her course next week. ''I might be suicidal as well,'' she
laughs. ''A degree for unemployment!'' Tricia laughs too, a big broad
smile.
This is an excerpt from a series of interviews of young people talking
about having a befriender to support them during a difficult period in
their life. The interviews are taken from a report, soon to be
published, which will highlight the work of Possilpark Befriending
Project based in Possilpark -- a large council estate in north-east
Glasgow. The brief for the interviewer was to try to establish whether
the investment in befriending had had any lasting consequences on the
young people who had participated in the project over the past six
years.
We can see from Tricia's story that it obviously has.
The Possilpark Befriending Project was set up in 1986 by Save the
Children in partnership with Strathclyde Regional Council social work
department. The youngsters who are helped by the project are all
involved in the Children's Hearing system and may be experiencing
difficulties at school, at home, or in the community, for example,
truancy, offending, solvent abuse, neglect.
While befriending is not always a cure for such difficulties it does
have a proven record in offering individual care and support, an adult
role model, respite from day-to-day pressures, and opportunities to
develop new interests and self-confidence.
Save the Children's experience of working with young people has shown
that to assist them in dealing with difficulties in their lives you have
to be able to develop and sustain a positive relationship, which is
central to befriending.
So what of the befrienders who give up their time to help, who are
they? How do they come to be involved with Save the Children?
Sam, for example: ''I had been thinking of doing some kind of work in
the community for a number of years but was unsure how I could be of
use. I saw a poster for the project at the university and thought, I
could do that!
''I think this kind of project is ideal. First, it offered a choice of
voluntary work and, secondly, the project provided social and financial
assistance. I find all the staff friendly and helpful and would not
hesitate to contact them.
''I am matched with Mary. Mary is a 12-year-old who has learning
difficulties and has rarely had the chance to leave her home environment
-- so I try to find something different for us to do every week. The
kind of activities which we currently enjoy are cinema, ice-skating,
baking, pony riding, cooking, and painting.
''I feel our friendship is going really well. Every week improves as I
learn what she can and cannot do, her likes and dislikes. And, of
course, every time she goes out and repeats experiences -- like getting
on the bus or tube -- she gains confidence and pride at having acquired
a new skill. Simple things like these, and watching Mary being able to
do them with ease, bring the greatest sense of achievement and happiness
to both of us. Apart from being her friend, I think this is where I can
be most useful to Mary, to help her learn practical things like
shopping, travelling, and taking care of herself.
''Mary, on the other hand, seems to be quite comfortable with me and
is not at all shy of holding my hand or arm when we are out or giving me
hugs. She eagerly awaits my arrival and when the day is over she never
wants to go home and tries to find clever excuses to prolong the
inevitable.''
It is ordinary people, drawn from the community of Glasgow, who come
forward and offer their time and interest to identified youngsters
referred by the social work department. Yet befriending can never be a
haphazard affair. It is the responsibility of the Save the Children
project staff to ensure every possibility is considered so that a child
or a young person has a good experience of having a befriender.
The preparatory work involves:
* Recruiting volunteers to undertake the befriending task;
* Selecting and vetting volunteers from information gathered at
selection interviews, from references and police checks;
* Offering training -- initially induction training in anticipation of
some of the experiences that may lie ahead, then ongoing training around
issues affecting individual youngsters;
* Support and supervision to individual volunteers as the contact
between befriender and project has to be regular and not waiting until
difficulties arise but providing regular opportunities to off-load and
share;
* Accepting and processing referrals from the social work department,
including establishing in principle whether befriending makes sense for
that particular youngster and whether the youngster understands what
befriending entails;
* Matching children and volunteers -- ensuring that their match will
be acceptable to both parties and involving parents and carers in the
process;
* Monitoring and reviewing the contact through regular review meetings
and contributing to child-care plans. Making judgments about the level
of contact between the befriender, youngster, and family and meeting
with all on an individual basis.
In a normal year the project will support around 40 youngsters whose
ages range from eight to 17. The majority live at home in the Possilpark
area, however the project tries to find befrienders for appropriate
youngsters who reside in children's homes, residential schools, and
hostels.
Befriending has shown itself to be particularly effective in
supporting the 16 to 18-year-old youngster leaving residential care and
attempting to secure accommodation, employment, and cope with the
challenges of adult life. It is a sad indictment on our society that so
many of our young people experience a poor quality of life through
poverty and rejection and drift into a cycle of homelessness, offending,
and drug misuse.
Save the Children is particularly aware of the plight of such 16 to
18-year-olds and has successfully applied for an Urban Programme Grant
to develop the work of the Possilpark Befriending Project to target more
resources on supporting 16 to 18-year-olds who are beset by problems of
low or non-existent income, homelessness, unemployment, and emotional
and practical difficulties. This new development is called Befriending
Plus.
Save the Children has employed a full-time worker and a team of 12
paid sessional staff who will support young adults involved in the
Children's Hearing and court system. It is planned to use the techniques
of befriending to develop a positive relationship with a young adult.
Because the face-to-face work will involve trying to tackle offending
behaviour, with young adults ''contracting in'' to the service, it is
more appropriate to employ sessional staff rather than rely upon the
goodwill of the community at large.
Through the co-operation and participation of the partners in this
important venture, Save the Children is working towards changes for the
benefit of children in Possilpark and using its direct experience to
influence policy and make a reality of children's rights for all our
children.
* Save the Children is looking for befriending volunteers who would be
given training, supervision, and have their expenses reimbursed. For

AFTER 16 years in opposition Labour is pardonably nervous of crowing
about its current opinion poll leads. Some Conservatives think that a
combination of tax cuts and attacks on such policy detail as Labour
reveals could still see them home in 1997.
Obviously they have to keep their spirits up but, after making all
allowances for closet Tories who won't come out in front of pollsters,
it is hard to share their optimism. Mr Blair looks close to a certainty
to walk through the front door of No 10 as Mr Major leaves by the back.
Labour managed a 3% national swing against the Tories at the last
General Election, aided by a deep recession, hindered by having Neil
Kinnock as leader and, it seems, by John Smith's Shadow Budget which
looked like a good idea at the time but appears to have misfired with
the electorate.
To get the parties back to where they were on polling day 1992 Mr
Major has the task approximating to a labour of Hercules of cutting back
Labour's poll support now running at 57.5% to 35.2%. In other words,
22.3% of those who now say they would vote for Mr Blair have got to be
rendered disenchanted, worried, or uncertain over the next 19 months,
while Tory support has to be transformed from 22.5% (I'm using the
latest Gallup figures) to 42.8%, a gain of 20.3%.
Put another way, the Conservatives now have 48 Commons seats that
would fall on a 3% swing to an opposition party. Even assuming they won
back every by-election seat they have lost in this Parliament, which is
doubtful, that would still leave them with 288 seats and out of power.
It would also leave Britain with a hung Parliament, as Labour would
have 307-310 seats, well short of an overall majority. Such estimates
are complicated because the next election will be fought on new
constituency boundaries. There will be eight more Commons seats, none in
Scotland, taking the total to 659. The redistribution gives the
Conservatives a small advantage but, as Labour tacticians played a
blinder with the Boundary Commissions, only in single figures. So, even
with that advantage the Tories on a national swing of 3% against them
would be out. Also I can tell readers that if one casts one's eye down
the list of Tory-held seats with majorities that would survive a 3%
swing it is very hard to imagine some of the other MPs holding on.
The Social Security Minister, Alistair Burt, does not really look much
safer in Bury North with a 4764 majority than his colleague David
Sumberg does in Bury South with 788, though it would take a swing of
over 4% to unseat him and one of less than 1% to do for Mr Sumberg.
In other words, the current feeling among those who pay attention to
such calculations -- politicians, academics, and journalists -- is that,
although Labour's huge poll lead will be cut back on the day of the real
poll it will still stay comfortably ahead.
Mr Blair is easily out-polling Mr Major on leadership qualities, not
least that of being ''a winner'', where he musters a positive vote of
61% against a negative one of 22% for the Prime Minister.
Mr Major could also suffer from his appointment of Mr Michael
Heseltine as his official deputy, leading him to be overshadowed by the
more charismatic First Secretary and also possibly causing uncertainty
in the public mind about who is actually leading the Government.
The Alliance suffered a dual leadership problem in 1987, symbolised by
the Spitting Image characterisation of a large David Owen puppet
bullying a small David Steel one, which naturally irritated the Liberal
leader.
The current decline in Liberal Democrat support could help the
Conservatives, though only marginally, making it easier for them to
regain some of their by-election losses and hold on to seven seats that
the Liberal Democrats should win from them on a 3% swing, although in
two of these -- Edinburgh West and Falmouth and Camborne -- Labour could
leapfrog the Lib-Dem challenger to take the seat.
At the moment the Conservative leadership would seem to have problems
enough restricting the swing to Labour to around 5%, and that would
provide Mr Blair with an overall majority of around 15 which, in fact,
might suit him quite well as the parliamentary party could be harder to
keep in order if his majority were much bigger.
Mr Major, of course, confounded predictions in 1992 and might manage
it again. Behind the natural Tory dislike of losing power has lurked
fear of the nightmare scenario of a wipe-out on the Canadian scale which
left the Progressive Conservatives with just two MPs.
However, the Conservatives have 154 seats with majorities which would
require a 10% swing or more for them to be lost. These incumbents should
be safe enough whatever happens, though that may not be much comfort to
their less happily situated colleagues.

IF it's rude to ask a lady her age, does the same apply to company
chairmen? There was John Robb the other day, the boss of Britain's
newest nuclear power company, brought about by the shotgun marriage of
Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric, vehemently trying to reassure
Scottish journalists that as long as he was chairman the company would
be headquartered in Scotland.
John though is 59, and while he looks as fit as a fiddle, he is not
exactly being pencilled in for a place in the record books as Britain's
longest serving chairman. So as guarantees go, the words ''cast iron''
don't immediately leap to mind.
Now this is not a diatribe about Nuclear Electric. Economics Editor
Alf Young is keeping more than an eye on that one. It is about why
people feel the need to make such guarantees in the first place.
If there was not something unusual about putting your headquarters in
Scotland, then such effusive guarantees to stay here would hardly be
required. After all, someone putting a company headquarters in London
would not give the same pledge, simply because they wouldn't think it
necessary. Headquarters and London go hand-in-hand, like Paul Gascoigne
and a peroxide bottle.
So what is it about Scotland that makes companies shy clear of putting
their brass plates up on a wall? Well, first it's not Scotland. It's
anywhere in Britain outside London really. Just as bees swarm together,
so do company directors, who never feel quite at home unless clubbing
together in the City.
We are told that in the electronic age companies can happily operate
from the most remote corners of the planet. But British directors are
chummy people. All the computers in the world cannot compensate for
meeting the suits you are doing deals with face-to-face across a bottle
of chilled Chardonay. Don't shoot them your best line until you see the
whites of their wine list would appear to be the maxim they live by.
Is that not the same in any country? Not quite. Germany has a
remarkably well-devolved economy with major company headquarters in
regional centres such as Frankfurt and Munich which do not feel a
pressing need to be in Bonn, or now Berlin.
In America, executives of a world giant like Coca-Cola are quite happy
in the south of the country. Media company CNN reaches around the world
from Atlanta, while major electronics companies are more than satisfied
being headquartered in California and Seattle, thousands of miles across
country from Washington.
True, some companies, mainly in the defence industry, feel the
pressing need to be near Washington, just because they feed off so many
government contracts. Funny how Republicans deride their Government for
giving money to individuals -- wasteful hand-outs -- while Government
hand-outs to arms manufacturers are a far nobler cause.
So perhaps if Scotland were independent, then more companies would
feel the need to set up camp around Edinburgh when it became a genuine
capital. It's a point Alex Salmond of the Scottish National Party says
he will be highlighting more in the autumn.
But it is not quite as automatic as that. After all, Tirana in Albania
has been a proper capital for many years without exactly creating a
business boom.
So perhaps it is time for Scotland's enterprise network to do far more
to attract headquarters to the country. After all, a company
headquarters brings with it highly paid jobs for accountants, lawyers,
merchant bankers, and similar types which the Edinburgh public schools
are so good at churning out. Surely more effort should go into
attracting headquarters, with the spin-off in highly paid jobs, rather
than expending our energies, as we do, attracting foreign electronics
companies which only promise a few part-time women a job assembling
circuit boards.
Perhaps instead of business parks Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd
should be building what could be called headquarter parks. All you would
need would be tasteful buildings with large executive suites, a golf
course, a gentleman's club in the middle, and a discreet branch or two
of Cayman or Swiss banks for the Fat Cats to keep their cream in.
But of course if Scotland is to have any self-respect it should be
building up its own large companies so that the headquarter count would
rise naturally. But it's not that easy. SMEs -- small to medium-sized
enterprises in consultant-speak -- tend to remain just that. Small. For
some reason Scottish executives just don't drive themselves into the
ground to make that huge leap into the big time.
So why do companies make such a leap in Japan and not in Scotland?
There are arguments about more support for industry from Japanese banks,
the lead Japan has in Total Quality Management, but no-one can say for
certain. But perhaps one difference between the two countries that has
been overlooked is golf courses. Yes, golf courses. Hardly any in Japan,
yet hundreds in Scotland. So could it be that Japanese directors, with
no golf courses to go to, simply put their energies into work, while
Scottish directors, after working to make a reasonable living, take
their foot off the capitalist accelerator, preferring a few hours on the
course.
Not every Scottish director is a golfer of course. Some are even
family men. There is more pressure on them to spend quality time with
the weans in Scotland because most children stay at home. Not so in
London, of course, where the brats can be consigned to boarding schools
so as not to get in the way of making money.
So is the solution in Scotland to close down the golf courses and turn
the land over to erecting boarding schools? A tad extreme of course. But
even that would almost be preferable to a country so devoid of its own
business self-confidence that it is expected to get excited when an
about-to-be sexagenarian promises to lease an office in Edinburgh.

HIGHLANDERS: A HISTORY OF THE HIGHLAND CLANS: By Fitzroy Maclean,
Adelphi: #25
THERE is an anamorphic painting, circa 1745, in the West Highland
Museum, Fort William. Place a cylinder on the tray smeared with paint
and a likeness of Prince Charles Edward Stuart is reflected in the
cylinder. It can also be done with a glass, and was a safe way of
drinking a toast to the Young Pretender.
Sir Fitzroy Maclean received his image of the Prince in similar
circumstances of secrecy. Going through a deed box of family papers, he
came across a small, twice-folded sheet of frayed and yellowing paper
bearing in faded ink the inscription ''Prince Charles Edward 1745 --
given to my grandfather's care by another Jacobite gentleman who was
afraid to have the portrait found on him.'' Maclean's packet contained
two tiny representations of the Prince, a fraction of an inch square,
bearing on either side of his head the letters ''PC''.
The discovery was ''the beginning of an enduring fascination with the
history of the Highlands and of my own family and clan'', Maclean
records in the preface to his newest and most ambitious book,
Highlanders: A History of the Highland Clans, which accompanies the
television programme, with Sean Connery as the narrator, shown recently
as part of the commemorative season of the 250th anniversary of the '45
Rebellion.
Few people seem better equipped to write a history of Highlanders than
Sir Fitzroy MacLean. He belongs to the landed family, the Macleans of
Ardgour, at least five centuries old; he was a warrior who was
parachuted into Yugoslavia to help Tito against the Nazis and therefore
has first-hand knowledge of the nature of guerrilla warfare in rough
terrain, which is what much of the history of the Highlands is about.
But since Maclean is an aristocrat and has been a decorated fighting
servant of the United Kingdom, isn't he bound to be on the side of the
landlords and the Union? It's an unjust assumption to make. I have
travelled with him through the Highlands and have seen him equally at
ease and equally interested in castle or croft.
This is not a polemical book. The author recognises that, immersed as
he is in the Highlands, he has to make ''due allowance to aim off, as it
were, for innate prejudice and try to keep sufficient balance to make
one's account acceptable to readers who may well have built-in
prejudices and preferences of their own''.
Amply illustrated with coloured photographs of castles and artefacts
associated with the Highlands, this large handsome volume is a
well-paced narrative of the emergence of the clan system through the
Scotti or Scots, the bellicose inhabitants of the kingdom of Dalriada
who had crossed from Northern Ireland.
The word clan is derived from the Gaelic word clann, children.
Maclean shows the formation of these proud families, and how their
territorial imperatives made them ruthless in defence of their own
lands. He also follows their emergence as leading forces in the shaping
of Scotland, with the chiefs of several of the great Highland clans
fighting with Bruce at Bannockburn.
The descendants of some of these same chiefs also fought with Charles
Edward Stuart at Culloden 400 years later. Fitzroy Maclean has already
written a study of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and since he is concerned with
the narrative drive of history rather than analysis in his new book, he
does not incorporate the revisionist theories of modern historians, who
argue that the Prince exploited his loyal Highland and Scottish support
and that he was much more interested in the throne of England than that
of Scotland, hence the catastrophic decision (by one vote) to invade
England.
Maclean does, however, deal with Highlanders post-Culloden, pointing
out that ''the Rising of 1745 gave the Government in London and their
numerous friends in Scotland the opportunity they had long been seeking
for a final reckoning with the Highlanders''.
But it wasn't only the punitive policies of the southern Government
following the defeat of the Jacobites, and what Maclean calls the
''heartless brutality'' of the Clearances, which threatened the survival
of the Gaelic language -- the essence of being a Highlander. Even before
the Prince set his foot in the heather many Highland chiefs had
discovered the diversions of Edinburgh, where the language was English.
The Enlightenment, which originated in the capital's drawing rooms,
where the spinet was preferable to the pipes, included James
Macpherson's ''translations'' of Ossian. A predominantly oral literary
tradition was exploited in a foreign language on paper, and English --
via Walter Scott -- became the medium for delivering the romantic
message about the Highlands.
In his preface Fitzroy Maclean recalls a dinner at Inveraray 30 years
ago when Donald Morrison, the Mull seanchaidh, kept the table spellbound
with the tragic story of the Battle of Traigh Ghruinnard, first in
Gaelic, then in English.
Maclean knows that written history can never supplant the oral
version, but in this book he manages to convey what being a Highlander
means, and has meant, down the turbulent centuries.

I'VE known two men who spent part of the Second World War in Japanese
prisoner of war camps. The most striking thing they had in common was a
steadfast reluctance to discuss the experiences of those years, even
with those with whom they shared their lives. Neither would ever forget,
neither felt able to forgive, and neither seemed capable of slaying
these ghosts by taking them out and looking at them.
Those of us born after that conflict, those of us with no personal
knowledge of war, perhaps lack the right to offer our thoughts as to how
such men, and indeed women, should approach the upcoming VJ-Day.
Yet today especially, with the 50th anniversary of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombs newly past, it's perhaps justifiable to try to place both
those bombs and the conduct of the Imperial Army in some kind of moral
context. One of the problems we have in doing so is the contrast between
the cause of the pain and suffering inflicted in the camps and the
devastation wrought by those first atomic explosions.
I suspect the core of the psychological horror uniformly blighting the
lives of ex-PoWs is that their maltreatment was meted out all too
personally. They could look into the eyes of their tormentors; witness
at first hand the capacity of humankind for cruelty. And all the while
try to cope with living in a land for which they had no kind of cultural
compass. The enormity of that experience has made many veterans unable
to countenance any act of forgiveness or reconciliation. The very
prospect of sharing an end-of-war service of commemoration with their
captors still has the capacity to induce raw rage.
It would be crass of the post-war generation not to understand the
instincts which provoke such a response. These survivors have been to a
place in their heads and in their hearts most of us are lucky never to
visit.
Yet somewhere a line has to be drawn. Some time the heirs of both sets
of combatants have to acknowledge the futility of visiting the sins of
the fathers on successive generations. VJ-Day is surely a moment when,
if the past can't be laid to rest, it should no longer be allowed to
dominate the future. For if we require any proof of the danger of
nursing grievances beyond their era we need look no further than the
unfolding tragedy in the former Yugoslavia.
Two years ago, at the Edinburgh Book Festival, I listened to Kate Adie
tell of her experience visiting neighbouring villages once peacefully
coexistent, now engaged in bitter conflict. Kate explained how, through
her interpreter, villagers had given her word-perfect accounts of the
atrocities which had been committed in their neighbourhood. Only later
was she to discover that the events recalled for her in such
bloodcurdling detail had occurred some 400 years before.
Long memories are no allies of peace.
And what of the nuclear bombs which finally brought the war to a
close? The carnage caused by laying waste to two major population
centres was much more anonymous.
The men who pressed the button, the men who took the political and
military decision, were not seen by the men, women, and children who ran
through the ruins of their town shedding skin incinerated by the blast.
I read the view of another Scottish columnist in another paper over
the weekend. The events in those cities in August 1945 are not something
for which we should apologise, he opined. Yet how can it be legitimate
to press the heirs of the Japanese perpetrators of camp atrocities for a
formal apology, yet remain sanguine about the unimaginable horrors of
that week which wiped out entire civilian populations, left thousands
dying in agony, and wrought who knows what manner of genetic disasters
in the next generation?
Some historians insist these bombs were the only thing which could
have stopped the war. Others question the motivation of Harry Truman and
a scientific community desperate to test their dramatic invention. I
have no facility for knowing who has the right of that equation.
I do know that the dawning of the nuclear age has proved little cause
for celebration.
People talk of it having kept the peace, clearly suffering from some
form of collective and selective amnesia. Nobody, so far as we can tell,
has deployed nuclear weapons again. But the world has remained full of
wars and the authorities in many countries have continued to use human
beings as unwitting guinea pigs as they refine their weapons of
destruction. A world in which countries like France openly flout the
spirit of the test ban treaty is not a world serious about preventing
nuclear proliferation.
Trying to strike the right note on VE-Day proved a difficult
operation. The Hyde Park event strayed too far into triumphalism for my
personal taste. VJ-Day, however, will be much more traumatic. Not a time
for brass bands, forties fun, and Dame Vera strutting her stuff. The
people who were imprisoned in Japan, and the people we bombed into
submission in Japan will have no shortage of memories to contemplate.
But the greatest gift they could leave their own grandchildren is a
slate wiped clean of racial hate.

We will try to win the next election in Scotland, make no mistake
about that
THE Scottish National Party believes it is yet again on the brink of
electoral breakthrough at the next General Election following successes
in the Perth and Kinross by-election, the European elections, and
consistently good polling figures. Party leader Alex Salmond explains to
Ken Smith why the nationalists will lose that election if they do not
compete more effectively in financial terms against the other parties,
and how his party can exploit growing doubts about Labour's commitment
to devolution
Q: Does the SNP's position in the opinion polls not suggest that there
is little indication of the real breakthrough needed to gain
independence?
A: We're actually going through the strongest SNP challenge to the
British political establishment in history. We've had almost five years
of the SNP at over 20% in the opinion polls, occasionally touching 30%.
This is the strongest, most sustained, reliable and consistent SNP
political challenge that we've ever seen.
Now obviously I'd be more happy if the SNP were at 40%, but I'm much
happier with this very important incremental growth at local government
level, European elections, the parliamentary by-election at Perth and
Kinross, than I would be with the boom and bust SNP politics of former
years. Up like a rocket. Down like a stick. I'm much happier with the
sustained level of support we're achieving.
Q: What do you have to do to make the breakthrough which will bring
you the seats?
A: Obviously you have to get over 30% of the vote and that's the
reality of the first past the post system. It's a system the SNP has
consistently opposed. I believe in proportional representation.
My tendency is not to whine about it too much because the chances are
that the SNP will get the three bells which are necessary under first
past the post to win the jackpot, so first past the post might end up
working for the SNP, even though I think it's the wrong system.
Now the SNP at the last election with a fairly considerable degree of
incompetence, and I can say that since I was the leader, increased our
vote by over 50% from 14% to almost 22% yet had a decline in the number
of our parliamentary seats. Now that is an achievement which is
unprecedented in politics as far as I know.
The lesson for the SNP is that people register your performance not in
the hundreds of thousands of votes you accumulate but in the number of
parliamentary seats. They look for chalk on the board. With the European
elections, Perth and Kinross, we've put some chalk on the board.
Q: You won Perth and Kinross which was a Tory seat, you lost Monklands
which was a Labour seat. Are you concerned about this?
A: Monklands was a Labour seat with an 18,000 majority turned into a
Labour seat with an 1800 majority. I regret that we did not win that
by-election. And I'm actually confident that if we had the same strength
of candidate support in Monklands as we did in Perth and Kinross we
would have won in Monklands.
I think we did not give our candidate the sustained level of support
to which she was entitled. I'm not talking about the effort of party
activists which as always was tremendous, but it was a very highly
pressured by-election campaign as you may remember. I think all the
campaigns came under huge pressure. The Labour campaign collapsed in the
last couple of days, but it was defending an 18,000 majority. The
collapse in its campaign was not as important as our failure to support
our candidate properly.
Now we made organisational changes after Monklands. I made these
changes at headquarters basically because of the experience of the
Monklands campaign. I think the vindication of these moves was the Perth
and Kinross campaign.
The introduction of a chief executive, the increase in staff resources
at headquarters, so that we could compete with the big boys and girls in
politics in terms of resources that we were able to deploy. Obviously I
don't just want to see that happen for a by-election, I want that to
happen at a General Election.
Now that's a key element in the SNP strategy. I'm not saying that
we're going to be able to spend #20m like the Tories did at the last
election, or even #2m or even a fraction of #2m, but we've got to spend
more than the #120,000 which was the total resources available at the
last General Election.
Q: Where will the money come from?
A: We've revamped the party's finances very considerably over the last
few years. The party is much stronger in the fundraising base both in
terms of headquarters but also in the branches.
I've got no doubt that we're going to have to look for substantial
increases in fundraising to a higher level as we are not yet at anything
like the sort of level we need to be to mount a real challenge in
resource terms to our Unionist opponents.
If we get outspent to the same level as we did at the last election,
you know, 200 to one, then we'll lose. Regardless of how good our
message is, regardless of how keen our activists are, regardless of the
fact that we've got right and justice on our side, we'll lose, and
therefore I don't intend to be out resourced and outspent to anything
like that percentage. I'm reconciled to the fact that we will be
outspent and outresourced, but I think there is a level of resources
required to deliver even the best message properly.
Q: Does it concern you that the new image of Michael Forsyth of being
a more listening, more caring Tory could revive his party's fortunes?
A: I think the Tories will recover from the 11% that they are
currently at in the opinion polls. I've always assumed that. I don't
think they will get anything close to even the 26% they achieved at the
last election.
The problem for Michael Forsyth is that the politics for the Tories in
Scotland are dictated from Westminster. And the central difficulty for
the Tories in Scotland -- that has seen them decline from 50% in 1955 --
is the question of identity. People know and feel and believe that their
party is a southern dominated party. Michael can put out as many press
releases as he likes it won't make any difference.
Michael's performance so far hasn't surprised me in the slightest. I
was certain he would become Scottish Secretary when he rather cleverly
backed John Major in the leadership campaign. That meant he was going to
become Scottish Secretary regardless of the result. A very astute
political move. An each-way bet. But secondly I was convinced he would
start off by being as nice as ninepence. I've known him for 20 years. He
has considerable personal charm -- maybe slightly oily for my taste --
but none the less considerable personal charm.
The idea that he would come in and say, ''Well I'm just going to be as
offensive as I was five years ago,'' I thought was absolutely ludicrous.
He would come in and say ''I'm now the Secretary of State and
everything's different.'' The trouble is people can recognise a
counterfeit when they see it.
Q: How keen is the SNP to exploit what it claims is the backtracking
of Labour leader Tony Blair on devolution?
A: Labour's reaction to criticism is very interesting. Labour looks
nervous, jumpy, deeply insecure. Palpably the concern about the
credibility of Labour's devolution commitments comes from within the
Labour Party itself.
Obviously we'll point out that Tony Blair has moved a substantial
distance if he ever knew about the the Claim of Right in the last six
years since it was signed. I've described it as a Grand Canyon between
the assertion of Scottish sovereignty, which was the Claim of Right in
1989, and the belief in parliamentary sovereignty, which is the belief
of Jack Straw and Tony Blair in 1995. That is something that they are
going to have to explain. They're going to have to say did they mean it
in 1989 or do they mean it in 1995. No amount of getting upset because
people are criticising them is going to cover that basic flaw in logic.
So yes, the message that Labour cannot be trusted on the constitution
is a very strong one for the SNP because it leads to the second
proposition that only the SNP is the guarantor of any real political
change in Scotland.
Q: George Robertson says there is no backtracking.
A: Well yes I know George says that, but George is someone who in
January of this year was quoted as saying the plans for English
devolution were the answer to the West Lothian Question. And in July of
this year was quoted as saying they were never intended to be the answer
to the West Lothian Question as they've now been ditched. So George I'm
afraid is suffering from what we call euphemistically political amnesia
as far as key aspects of the devolution package is concerned.
I thought his comment, presumably addressed to me, that Tony Blair did
not have to sign the Claim of Right as he wasn't a Scottish MP was at
best fatuous.
Q: Tony Blair himself has not said anything which would suggest any
backtracking. Is this not just SNP hype?
A: In that case all Tony Blair has to do then is to answer my letter,
endorsing the Claim of Right and the assertion of Scottish sovereignty.
It's open knowledge at Westminster that the advisers around Tony Blair,
the people whom he relies on, are hostile to Labour's devolution plans
for Scotland. They think the Scottish question might be a weakness for
Labour south of the Border.
Q: Do you believe that this argument could finally unlock the door for
the SNP to the mass of Labour voters?
A: Labour has contained the SNP, albeit with the SNP at a high level
of support, basically by, in my view, pretending to be the party
speaking for Scotland, the party that is going to realise Scottish
ambitions, and by moving as in 1989 to a radical position for Labour on
the constitution.
Now for me of course Labour's devolution package is weak, inadequate
and wouldn't answer the key questions. If the SNP can present ourselves,
as indeed we should present ourselves, as the guarantors of real
political change, as the springboard, the catalyst, to real political
advance then that puts us in a stronger position compared to the Labour
Party.
And if the simplicity, and the theoretical soundness of the concept of
independence in Europe is contrasted with the increasing complexity and
doubts surrounding the devolution package then that obviously
strengthens the underlying constitutional argument which is between
independence and devolution.
Q: Some Labour politicians have drawn parallels between nationalism
and racism, does that give you difficulties?
A: Labour's attack does not give us difficulties. The SNP has a very
good image because people recognise the SNP as a party thirled to
democratic traditions. If the SNP had a weakness in the past, because it
was concentrating on the key constitutional aspects about Scotland it
tended to ignore social divisions within Scotland. I don't think the SNP
can do that.
The SNP has to address social divisions in Scotland and always be a
party and a force which is leading and arguing and demanding greater
understanding and co-operation between the various groups and elements
in Scottish society.
I've recently had a number of meetings with the Pakistani community in
Scotland which have been extremely productive, extremely positive, and
which are going to emerge as another key element in the rainbow
coalition that the SNP is bringing forward supporting independence in
Scotland.
So I think the SNP must get much more involved in issues, not just
supporting the anti-racism campaigns which the SNP has done for a number
of years, but also taking a proactive role in promoting greater
understanding of the strength of Scottish society which lies to a great
extent in its diversity. Scotland, to use William McIlvanney's term, is,
and has always been, a mongrel nation, and we should be proud of that.
Q: Are there difficulties for the SNP in the continuing criticism
elsewhere over Europe?
A: There is no possibility of the SNP backtracking on its European
commitment, and there is no serious body of opinion within the SNP which
is anti Europe. So we don't have that intense political argument within
the party. Scotland is still more sympathetic to the European cause than
south of the Border.
Small nations tend to be more pro-European. They don't have the same
hang ups of some of the larger countries. Take the UK, what are the big
negatives in the UK? Well the big negative is the possibility of losing
sterling as a currency. Apart from being a pretty disastrous currency
for the United Kingdom over the last 70 years -- in fact it has probably
been the single most important factor in economic decline -- most of the
economic crises that the UK has gone through have been associated with
runs on the pound.
But the loss of currency is something which is seen as a virility
symbol. To a small country there is never the illusion that having an
independent currency is associated with being an independent state. The
idea that sterling is independent -- that you can isolate UK interest
rate policy from the interest rate policy in Germany -- is ridiculous.
Q: Why are you not winning over the business community to what you see
as the economic benefits of independence?
A: Three reasons. One, traditionally the business community has been
thirled to the Conservative Party. Secondly the business community by
and large is suspicious of change, any change. And thirdly, the SNP
hasn't explained the case properly.
There are reasons to believe they are all changing. One is that
virtually no-one is thirled to the Conservative Party any more. There is
deep disillusionment with the Conservative Party. Business is not immune
to that disillusionment.
Secondly business is less resistant to change now. We are living in an
economic environment where change is part and parcel of all business
life. And the third thing hopefully is that the SNP campaign to be
launched at our conference is going to address this area in a way which
we have not done successfully before. First of all the argument as to
whether Scotland pays its way. I'm confident as I've always been that we
can demonstrate beyond question that Scotland is a rich area of the
United Kingdom which more than pays its way.
Secondly, the SNP has to explain the consequences of becoming
independent. Here in Edinburgh, the impact of becoming a real capital
city with all of the attendant institutions of a real capital.
The embassies, the consulates, the influx of overseas legations and
their representatives would be a tremendous stimulus to the economy of
the city. Now the SNP would definitely not want to make the UK mistake
of concentrating everything in the capital. A capital city none the less
has that benefit of being a real European capital as opposed to a
provincial British city.
Q: Could the General Election come too soon for you to break into the
large lead that Labour holds?
A: No, I think that things can change in politics very quickly and
very decisively. At the last election coming from a very low base, the
SNP in a matter of months mounted what was a very impressive challenge
which certainly panicked the Labour Party.
We weren't able to sustain that challenge perhaps in the last week or
two of the campaign. Looking back I'm convinced we ran primarily into a
resource wall. We couldn't sustain it because we didn't have the
resources. If we can overcome that difficulty we can mount a much more
sustained challenge at the coming election.
The fact of the Tory success at the last election is that their vote
increased by 1%. The SNP support increased by 8%. The success in the
Tory Party was in reinforcing organisationally, and in resource terms,
its strongest seats.
It did that with a degree of ruthlessness which caught the other
political parties in Scotland on the hop. We'd written them off. And I
think all the other parties should take lessons from that.
Q: So you will have to concentrate resources in specific areas?
A: The SNP was absolutely correct at the last election to try to win
the election. A political party which doesn't try to win the election
should dust itself down and prepare to leave the table. We will try to
win the next election in Scotland, make no mistake about that. There are
areas where an extra bit of help from the centre would pay substantial
political dividends.
I think our organisation especially in seats where the SNP is mounting
a serious challenge like for example in Dumbarton, or Linlithgow, or
what is now Clackmannan and will soon be Ochils, has left a considerable
amount to be desired.
So I think we've got scope and room for improvement, both in terms of
how we present our overall message of trying to win the election, and
also in terms of how we target more effectively to make sure we win more
seats.
Q: If you don't win, do you agree that devolution is a stepping stone
to independence?
A: Yes. Devolution would be a stepping stone to independence if the
Scottish people vote for independence. The trouble with the Tory
argument is it seems to ignore the fact that Scotland can only become
independent if the Scottish people wish it. It depends on the consent of
the Scottish people.
The idea that you should on the one hand like Michael Frosyth say ''Oh
well the reason we shouldn't have devolution is that it might lead to
independence'' seems to me a bit of a defeatist one and tends to put his
own political opinions before the wishes of the Scottish people.
On the other hand the argument of George Robertson is equally bad. ''I
shall only support devolution'', he told me in the Great Debate,
''because I'm convinced it won't lead to Scottish independence''. I
think it is far better to argue for the position you think is best for
the Scottish people, and to accept their verdict regardless of what it
is.
Q: Since you became SNP leader, Labour and the Conservatives have
changed their leaders, and there has been speculation about Paddy
Ashdown of the Liberal Democrats. How long will you remain leader?
A: Yes, I'm awfully grateful that Paddy Ashdown is still the Old
Man of UK politics. Still I note I'm still, even with Michael Forsyth
who is a few months older than me, the youngest political leader in
Scotland. I intend to be one of the longest serving. That of course
depends, not just on the SNP, it depends on the reaction of the Scottish
people, and into their hands I happily commend myself.

A GLASGOW-based software company has invented the world's first
four-dimensional building simulation computer system. By cutting energy
bills and eliminating sick building syndrome, the new system is set to
revolutionise the building industry.
Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) has developed the
money-spinning programme which introduces the perspective of time to
existing 3-D systems.
The company, with a workforce of nine, expects turnover to increase
tenfold in the next five years, to more than #4m, with the commercial
marketing of the package.
IES's five-year, #10m investment in developing the new technology has
paid off. The firm recently was awarded its largest contract to date --
a computerised mock-up of what will be Europe's biggest shopping centre,
intended for Dartford, Kent.
Australian-based Lend Lease Global Investments is behind the
#250mproject to build an out-of-town mall on a disused quarry.
Construction work will start early next year. The completed centre will
be more than a kilometre long and developers predict it will attract
150,000 shoppers a day.
IES will help develop a natural ventilation system for the complex in
place of air conditioning.
The time factor incorporated in IES's new software allows architects
and planners to simulate the performance of a new building around the
clock and throughout the four seasons -- before a brick is laid.
IES also claims the new software will eradicate sick building
syndrome, a problem that develops when poor ventilation or temperature
control creates an unhealthy environment for workers.
Commercial director Doug Wilkie said: ''We can simulate the effect of
heating and lighting on the health and performance of the workers in a
building. The earlier we come on board, the more benefit we can
provide.''
The Virtual Environment system has proved itself already by achieving
impressive capital and running-cost savings on construction projects.
''We saved British Airways #300,000 at its new combined Business
Centre at Heathrow Airport by showing there was no need to invest in
expensive window blinds by simulating conditions of bright sunshine,''
Mr Wilkie said.
The company was set up in 1988 as Abacus Simulations under the
new-business incubator programme at Strathclyde University.
The name was changed to IES in March to coincide with a move to
Glasgow Software Centre -- a new business centre for software developers
set up by Glasgow Development Agency.

THE chief executive and the director of recreation of Edinburgh
District Council will hold talks today over ''jobs for the girls''
allegations.
Conservative councillors on the administration have called also on
chief executive William Blyth to hold an inquiry into the claims.
Newspaper reports at the weekend claimed a group of lesbian council
officials was bending equality regulations to get their partners work
with the equal opportunities authority.
The report said unqualified people were favoured for posts within the
council's swimming pools, ahead of qualified applicants.
Edinburgh's director of recreation, Mr Roger Jones, said last night he
was reluctant to take action on the anonymous newspaper allegations but
appealed to the complainers to come forward.
''Staff employed by the council would know how to go through the
proper procedures. As yet, we have received no formal complaint or
grievance.
''If someone is prepared to come forward to substantiate the
allegation, I can guarantee confidentiality.
''I shall be meeting the chief executive tomorrow to discuss the
allegations,'' he said.
Conservative group leader, Councillor Daphne Sleigh, led calls for an
immediate investigation into the report.
''We absolutely uphold equal opportunities in the organisation but
this is quite clearly not the case. I will be demanding the Labour
administration look at this,'' she said.
Recreation chairman, Councillor Steve Cardownie, has already pledged
to investigate the claims personally.

<HEADLINE>Study reports fall in British share of North Sea market</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977010800</RECORDNO>

THE UK industry's share of the British North Sea market fell last year
according to a study by economic and management analysts Mackay
Consultants of Inverness.
The company has produced estimates of the UK content of the British
offshore market since 1980 and the 1994 figures show substantial
variations by category with UK companies capturing 87% of the production
and maintenance operation work and just 26.6% of the installation
operations.
The consultants originally began monitoring the UK share of
expenditure because they believed the then Offshore Supplies Office
figures were misleadingly high.
The OSO's definition was based on the location of companies rather
than ownership so subsidiaries of foreign oil service firms based in the
UK were regarded as British.
According to the consultants, this is useful for some purposes but not
for others because although American and other foreign firms create
substantial employment, profits are repatriated.
''Another spin-off effect which has concerned us for many years are
the implications of the high foreign involvement in the UK sector of the
North Sea for the abilities of domestic companies to get involved in
export markets for offshore equipment and services,'' says the study.
''UK involvement in these export markets has been very disappointing,
particularly in the high-technology sectors.''
It adds that many parts of the industry are still dominated by foreign
companies, either overseas or with UK bases.
The OSO figures have not been published since 1990 but Mackay has
calculated what they would be according to OSO's definition.
In 1980, the OSO figure for the UK's market share was 70.8% compared
to Mackay's 52.6%.
In 1993, the OSO figure (as calculated by Mackay) was 81.7% compared
with the consultants' 55.6%.
Last year, the OSO figure dropped to 79.3% and Mackay's to 53.6%.
''There was a fairly steady rise over the period 1989-93 to a peak
level of 55.6%, thus the 2% fall in the UK's market share was quite
surprising,'' the study said.
''We believe there are two main reasons for that fall. These are the
effects of the European Union's Procurement Directive and renewed
interest by some foreign oil service companies, particularly American,
in the North Sea market.
''Under the procurement directive, the oil companies are now obliged
to advertise their main contracts in the Official Journal of the
European Union.
''There has been much greater international competition for many of
these contracts. The best example is probably the fabrication sector,
where recent key orders for the jackets for the Judy and Britannia
fields have gone to CIO of Italy and Dragados of Spain respectively.
''As a consequence, the UK yards' share of the UK fabrication market
has fallen considerably. That is a trend which is notable across many
categories.
''Secondly, some of their international service companies withdrew
from or reduced their interests in the North Sea following the falls in
oil prices in the late 1980s. In the light of some of the recent upsurge
in the North Sea market, some have returned.''
Mackay's world offshore oil and gas production statistics for 1994
show that world offshore oil production increased by 5.9% last year and
85.3% of the additional output was from the North Sea.
Offshore output in the North Sea and elsewhere in Western Europe grew
by a massive 19.5% in 1994 and most of that was from the UK and Norway.
''It is not surprising that Opec have expressed concern about the size
of this growth and its depressing effect on world oil prices. Total
world oil consumption in 1994 rose by 1.7%, which is higher than the
overall 0.9% increase in oil production.
''However, the massive growth in North Sea output must have been one
of the main factors causing the fall in oil prices during the year.''
The consultants expect this year or 1996 to be the peak year for North
Sea oil production, followed by a slow but sustained decline which
should enable Opec to increase its market share again and lead to some
price increases in the next five years.

A RETIRED antique collector has spurned an appeal to return three
works of art to Inverness which the old town council gave away 34 years
ago.
The sandstone carvings, portraying Faith, Hope, and Charity as three
beautiful maidens, by Scottish Victorian sculptor Andrew Davidson, were
once a landmark in the Highland capital.
They now have pride of place in the garden of the private museum
created by 82-year-old Norris Wood in the mansionhouse at Graemeshall,
Holm, near Kirkwall in Orkney.
Councillors in Inverness agreed last week to back a move to retrieve
the figures, which once stood on top of a building in the Highland
capital.
Mr Wood, a stonemason by trade, is now blind, but he said: ''They are
not for sale at any price. I am just not interested in money for them. I
cannot see them now but I can still feel the quality of the sandstone
carving. I want them to stay in the family after my day, so that
visitors to the museum I created can continue to enjoy them for decades
to come.''
The 7ft 6in statues were carved by the same sculptor who created the
famous bronze figure of Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald at Inverness
Castle.
The idea of obtaining 106-year-old Faith, Hope, and Charity came from
Mr Wood's late wife Edith.
They were available to anyone willing to take them away at no cost to
Inverness town council in 1961. They had lain for six years in a store
after the building on which they stood, at the corner of Castle Street
and High Street, was knocked down in 1955.
The corner, opposite Inverness Town House, is now where Britain's most
northerly branch of McDonald's is sited.
Mr Wood is now a resident at St Rognvald's Eventide Home in Kirkwall.
His daughter-in-law Cilla Wood acts as curator of Mr Wood's museum on
Orkney, which is a celebration of his lifelong passion for antiques.

ENGLAND rugby captain Will Carling insisted yesterday his reported
close friendship with the Princess of Wales did not affect his marriage.
He said he would take legal advice over newspaper claims that he had
had ''secret trysts'' with Diana and had been visiting her at Kensington
Palace up to three times a week.
It was reported that the 29-year-old rugby hero, who married his wife
Julia in June last year, would chat for hours on the telephone with the
princess and worked out with her at the exclusive Chelsea Harbour Club
gym.
In a statement yesterday, Carling said: ''It is no secret that I know
Princess Diana. Our acquaintance has not in any way affected the
priority I have always given to Julia and my rugby.
''I will of course be taking advice from my lawyers.''
Carling spoke out after his former personal assistant Hilary Ryan, who
he said was sacked four weeks ago for ''making waves in the office and
inventing and initiating confrontations'', made a catalogue of
allegations to the News of the World.
She said Carling and Diana swapped nicknames and gifts, and claimed
Carling had a special phone to take Diana's calls. Ms Ryan was quoted as
saying: ''He's been running round after her like a puppy.''
Carling was said to call Diana ''Boss'' and she called him ''Captain''
after their friendship started 18 months ago.
Ms Ryan, who worked for Carling's business leadership company Insights
for 14 months, said Carling had a special phone installed at the office.
''He'd ring her two or three times a day and they'd gossip and giggle.
I knew who he was talking to on it, because he'd always say 'Boss' in
their conversations,'' she said.
Carling, who has led England to three Grand Slams, captained the team
which reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in South Africa earlier
this year.
Before the tournament, he was sacked for calling the Rugby Football
Union committee ''57 old farts'' in a Channel 4 programme but was
reinstated two days later after apologising.
In March, Carling arranged for princes William and Harry to have a
kick-around with the Eng-land rugby squad in training before the World
Cup.
Carling gave Diana a two-inch china pig painted with a pink sweatshirt
as a reminder of the Martha's Vineyard sweatshirt she wore for working
out at the gym, Ms Ryan said.
In return, the princess is said to have given him a two-foot-high ugly
troll doll wearing an England rugby shirt.
''They would meet up at the Harbour Club on a Monday morning around
9am for a workout and then dress for coffee.
''Several times a week, he'd say he was meeting a friend and he'd
disappear for a few hours,'' she said.
In his statement, Carling said his former personal assistant should be
''well aware of the meaning of confidentiality''.
He said: ''Hilary Ryan was employed by my company for 14 months after
she had approached us showing interest in a job.
''She claimed that she had worked in management training for a firm of
accountants and should therefore be well aware of the meaning of
confidentiality.
''As Hilary is correctly reported as saying, she was dismissed because
of her habit of making waves in the office and inventing and initiating
confrontations where none existed.
''She told me that she wanted another job in a similarly confidential
post in management training.
''She asked me to sign a reference which she wrote herself. I am
afraid that she might find it rather hard to get that job now.''

<HEADLINE>CalMac workers defy island Sabbatarians</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977010803</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DOZENS of islanders queued on the main pier in Stornoway, Isle of
Lewis, yesterday to watch as ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne defied
the island's Presbyterian hardline Sabbatarians.
Many decided such a public defiance of church leaders as openly
painting and welding on the new ferry meant just one thing -- regular
Sunday sailings to Lewis are not far away.
A local minister said last week the company was ''to be condemned''
after hearing of work in progress last Sunday.
While engineers had allegedly been spotted at work last Sunday on the
new Ullapool to Stornoway ferry, the Isle of Lewis, the Gourock-based
company yesterday came completely out of the Sabbath breakers' closet.
The bow visor of the new #17m ferry, in service for just one week, was
fully opened and teams of painters could be seen hard at work.
The only hint of discretion was that the ship was turned around so the
bow faced away from the town.
Many of the ferry's regular crew were there too, obviously at work and
not just there to spectate.
This was not the sort of thing the Sunday drivers of Stornoway
expected to see and they got out their cameras and clicked away at the
men at work.
Others watching thought there was not much wrong but did not want to
be named ''because of the cousins''.
One 30-year-old council worker, from Laxdale, near Stornoway, said:
''Why shouldn't this work go on today? It's obviously a work of
necessity as they cannot do this work when the ferry is sailing.
''I'm glad that CalMac is at last standing up to the bullying of
certain ministers of the church up here.
''I would appreciate and use a Sunday ferry. Most people would,
although some will be too scared to say so.''
His wife agreed, and added: ''It would not change Stornoway to have
one ferry in and out on Sunday.''
However, there are many on Lewis whose views are very different and
they will be fiercely critical of the company for its disregard for what
they claim are strong local sensitivities.
Generally, of course, they would not be out for a drive on the
Sabbath.
One retired publican tutted loudly as he watched the work in progress.
''I'm not what you'd call religious but you'd think they'd leave all
that until another day of the week or do it late at night.''
The issue of Sunday ferries to Lewis and Harris has proved problematic
for CalMac in the past. It abandoned plans for Sunday ferries to Harris
a few years ago after sustained protest.
Only last Friday, the Rev John Macleod, of the Free Presbyterian
Church in Stornoway, criticised CalMac for allegedly making people work
the Sunday before.
''There was no need for it. It was neither necessity nor mercy. The
other ferry, the Suilven, was berthed alongside the Isle of Lewis and
could have been used until any necessary work was done during the
week,'' he said.
So, was yesterday's bold display a shot across the bows of the Wee
Frees and others opposed to Sunday sailings? No-one could be found at
the company's offices to comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>New direction for last Scottish lightship</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND's last remaining lightship, which gave generations of
mariners safe passage into the Firth of Forth, is set for a new berth --
to the relief of a district council which spent thousands of pounds in a
bid to retain it as a floating museum.
For the past few years, the North Carr Lightship -- officially
registered as a museum -- has been sitting in the harbour at Anstruther,
Fife, after being decommissioned in 1975.
The vessel proved to be a drain on the resources of North East Fife
district, which invested thousands of pounds in maintenance. Fife
Regional Council, the Scottish Development Agency, and the Scottish
Tourist Board also ploughed in resources.
Tidal problems at the East Neuk harbour, however, meant the ship was
continually battered by heavy seas, particularly the spring tides,
leading to it taking on water below decks.
This month, the North Carr will be towed to the Tay, where Dundee Port
Authority will take over its maintenance, in a project to make her a
museum attraction in Victoria Dock, alongside Britain's oldest floating
warship, HMS Unicorn.
It is expected that following checks on the lightship by marine
engineers, the North Carr will leave Anstruther around August 14, if
tides permit safe sailing.
The lightship, built on the Clyde in 1933, is regarded by maritime
experts to have given outstanding service to communities whose
livelihoods depended on fishing in the North Sea.
Yesterday, as Captain John Watson, chief executive of Dundee Port
Authority, was looking forward to his new charge, the district council
appeared happy the lightship was being saved without it needing to
inject further cash.
Depute director of recreation, Mr James Hooten, admitted: ''We have
spent a lot of money on the North Carr project but we are glad it is
being saved.
''It is currently being inspected to ensure it is seaworthy, and it is
likely that on completion of a successful survey, it could be moved
around August 14.''
Captain Watson said his authority had been asked, as long ago as 1993,
whether it might be interested in taking the ship. The Clyde Maritime
Trust also expressed an interest, to avoid the ship going to the
breaker's yard.
He said: ''A lot of work has been done on the ship and I am keen to
encourage interest in its history. It is the last of the lightships in
the area, and will complement the attraction of Victoria Dock.''
The North Carr was in service off Fife Ness from 1933 to 1975. Its
crew witnessed the first air raid on mainland Scotland in 1939, when
Luftwaffe bomber crews used it as a navigation marker.

<HEADLINE>Architect condemns Ayr citadel plan</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977010805</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL has come under fire for missing an opportunity to develop
properly one of the finest coastal sites in Europe.
The citadel site at the harbour front in Ayr has lain derelict for
decades but now plans are being prepared for a leisure and housing
development.
An architect who worked on other plans for the site, however, has
dismissed the new scheme as ''less than half baked'' and accused Kyle
and Carrick District Council of missing an opportunity which will never
be repeated.
Mr Alastair Murdoch, who is based in Ayr, was one of the unsuccessful
bidders for the design contract for the multi-million pound scheme,
which will be funded jointly by the public and private sectors.
He said: ''I know that people will say this is just sour grapes but I
have remained silent for many months and accepted the disappointment
that architects face every day.
''My heart sank, though, when I saw the artist's impression of the
first stage of the development to be carried out on a design and build
basis by Wimpey. It does not appear in any way to fit in with the design
brief to which I and many other architects worked.
''It seems nowadays that everyone wants to take the quick-fix option
of giving a design and build contract to a company. What was needed here
was an ambitious overall plan into which the builders would have had to
fit.''
Mr Murdoch's plan was runner-up to one from London-based Patel Taylor,
but now he fears the council is moving away from that plan and ignoring
the original design brief.
His vision was for a rising sea wall which would incorporate shops,
restaurants, and housing and for an all-weather sports hall to replace
but not augment the existing swimming baths.
He added: ''The baths are in a hideous building and as they lose
thousands of pounds every year are a drain on the town's finances. The
building should be knocked down and the total new development begun on a
new site.
''I despair when a council chooses a short-term political expedient
against what is best for Ayr, its people, and the tourists who visit.
There has never been a better time than the last few days to see just
how popular this coast is when the sun shines.
''But what is there for people to do? Play on the sand and eat ice
cream, surely we can do better.''
Mr Murdoch disclosed that the chairman of the judges, Professor
Stanfield Smith, had described the citadel as one of the finest coastal
sites in Europe and that it deserved careful and sensitive treatment.
Mr Murdoch added: ''I fear now that the plans will gather dust and we
will see a piecemeal development of a sports hall and some housing plots
sold to the highest bidder.''
''It would appear that there is neither the desire nor the capability
within our local council to put in place the required funding and
technical expertise to implement this major site development. If public
opinion is not mobilised then quite simoly we deserve what our elected
members of council decide to give us,'' he added.
However, Provost Gibson MacDonald, of Kyle and Carrick District
Council, said: ''I am surprised and deeply disappointed that a
professional man has chosen to mount an attack like this without first
checking his facts.
''Contrary to what Mr Murdoch says, the development of the citadel is
moving along well and very much along the lines of the Patel Taylor
design.
''I cannot help but think that Mr Murdoch's attack has been fuelled by
his disappointment at failing to win the competition.''

CHANGI: MORE than 200 British war veterans crowded into a small museum
in the grounds of Singapore's Changi prison today to pay tribute to the
thousands of men and women who died in the naval war against Japan.
Frail and exhausted by the midday heat, the veterans stood in silence
as organisers unveiled the first memorial to the lost sailors,
submariners, airmen, and marines of the wartime British and allied
navies in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE>Architect condemns 'quick-fix' Ayr citadel plan</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAVID STEELE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977010820</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL has come under fire for missing an opportunity to develop
properly one of the finest coastal sites in Europe.
The citadel site at the harbour front in Ayr has lain derelict for
decades but now plans are being prepared for a leisure and housing
development.
An architect who worked on other plans for the site, however, has
dismissed the new scheme as ''less than half baked'' and accused Kyle
and Carrick District Council of missing an opportunity which will never
be repeated.
Mr Alastair Murdoch, who is based in Ayr, was one of the unsuccessful
bidders for the design contract for the multi-million pound scheme,
which will be funded jointly by the public and private sectors.
He said: ''I know that people will say this is just sour grapes but I
have remained silent for many months and accepted the disappointment
that architects face every day.
''My heart sank, though, when I saw the artist's impression of the
first stage of the development to be carried out on a design and build
basis by Wimpey. It does not appear in any way to fit in with the design
brief to which I and many other architects worked.
''It seems nowadays that everyone wants to take the quick fix option
of giving a design and build contract to a company. What was needed here
was an ambitious overall plan into which the builders would have had to
fit.''
Mr Murdoch's plan was runner-up to one from London-based Patel Taylor,
but now he fears the council is moving away from that plan and ignoring
the original design brief.
His vision was for a rising sea wall which would incorporate shops,
restaurants, and housing and for an all-weather sports hall to replace
but not augment the existing swimming baths.
He added: ''The baths are in a hideous building and as they lose
thousands of pounds every year are a drain on the town's finances. The
building should be knocked down and the total new development begun on a
new site.
''I despair when a council chooses a short-term political expedient
against what is best for Ayr, its people, and the tourists.''
Mr Murdoch disclosed that the chairman of the judges, Professor
Stanfield Smith, had described the citadel as one of the finest coastal
sites in Europe and that it deserved careful and sensitive treatment.
Mr Murdoch added: ''I fear now that the plans will gather dust and we
will see a piecemeal development of a sports hall and some housing plots
sold to the highest bidder.''
However, Provost Gibson MacDonald, of Kyle and Carrick District
Council, said: ''I am surprised and deeply disappointed that a
professional man has chosen to mount an attack like this without first
checking his facts.
''Contrary to what Mr Murdoch says, the development of the citadel is
moving along well and very much along the lines of the Patel Taylor
design.
''I cannot help but think that Mr Murdoch's attack has been fuelled by
his disappointment at failing to win the competition.''

THE Tate Gallery was evacuated yesterday following a leak from a
sculpture containing a dangerous gas.
As afternoon crowds packed the gallery at Millbank, in London, staff
spotted the escaping iodine from the Rites of Passage by Hamad Butt.
Firefighters were called and the Tate was shut for 45 minutes. Staff
put into action a pre-planned emergency procedure designed to cope with
a leak from the exhibit.
The lit abstract glass construction, in the shape of a ladder, formed
part of the gallery's summer exibition of contemporary artists.
As well as the gas, the Rites of Passage, contains electrical elements
which illuminate the work in a complex sequence.
The Tate's director of public affairs Sandy Nairne, said: ''The
exhibit is designed to make you aware of the fragility of sculpture.
''If something goes wrong, you would be in a dangerous environment.
It's really a work about the dangers of life.''
The leaking part was removed and is being examined. It is not yet
known how the leak was caused.

A VICAR yesterday condemned the ''devilish influence'' in society when
he conducted a memorial service for little Sophie Hook, who was found
murdered a week ago.
Canon Trevor Davies told a congregation in Colwyn Bay, North Wales,
which included seven-year-old Sophie's parents and family: ''We are all
here with one purpose: to show we are a body of people who care.
''We are a body of people who love and a body of people who are
prepared to support people in distress.''
Canon Davies said the 300-strong congregation at St Paul's Church of
Wales was a microcosm of society outside.
''But outside there is also an influence -- thankfully one that one
rarely finds in church -- an influence devilish in origin which condemns
people to exploit the vulnerable, murder the helpless, mug the elderly,
frighten the stranger, to be a law unto themselves,'' he said.
''Is there any wonder at all that people are generally frightened,
that they can't understand what is happening in their society?''
Sophie, of Great Budworth, Cheshire, was found dead on the beach at
nearby LLandudno a week ago yesterday. A 30-year-old local man, Howard
Hughes, appeared in court on Friday charged with her murder.
In the congregation, which included many children, were Sophie's
parents, Chris, 37, and Julie, 34. They walked into the stone-built
church hand-in-hand with their other children, Jemma, 9, Joseph, 5, and
carrying baby Ellie, 21 months.
Canon Davies greeted them at the church door. He kissed Mrs Hook and
shook her husband's hand. Mr Hook is a sales manager and his wife a
supply teacher.
Also there were Sophie's aunt and uncle, Danny and Fiona Jones, and
their children Luke, 9, Alex, 6, Jacob, 4, and two-year-old Callum. Mrs
Jones is Julie Hook's sister.
Sophie was camping in 39-year-old Mr Jones's garden when she was
abducted and murdered.
Mrs Hook's parents, Pearl and Mike Roberts, were also among other
relatives present yesterday. They joined local people in the large, airy
85-year-old church which dominates the popular seaside resort.
The two detectives who led the hunt, Superintendent Eric Jones and
Chief Inspector John Williams, went along with their families.
Canon Davies told the congregation: ''Let us make this service as
happy as we can.''
He said of Sophie's family: ''Here this morning they have forgotten
their sadness because they have come here as representatives of all the
families outside who have fallen innocent victims of people who decided
to live outside the law to satisfy their own selfish grievances, urges,
and desires.''
Canon Davies added: ''Last Sunday's nightmare experience is so
haunting, they (Sophie's family) will continue to remember it all their
lives. And the experience of being kissed by vivacious, fun-loving
Sophie is one that will be remembered for a lifetime.''
During the service, which lasted nearly 90 minutes, a collection was
made for the Sophie Hook Memorial Fund.
Her funeral will be held next Friday at Great Budworth.
Villagers at Great Budworth, near Northwich, Cheshire, where the Hook
family are regular worshippers at the parish church, remembered Sophie
in their prayers yesterday.
The congregation of 41, including families with young children and
toddlers, heard the vicar, the Rev Derek Mills, speak of the Hook family
and their grief.
Mr Mills, who arrived back at the twelfth-century church from a
working holiday in Germany on Monday, the day after Sophie's body was
found, relayed a message from her parents, Julie and Chris Hook,
thanking the congregation for its support.
''They would love to be here but feel it is more appropriate they go
over to north Wales where there is a service for Sophie. I am sure our
prayers are with them in their grief,'' he said.
* Police were continuing their widespread search yesterday for the
murder weapon that killed 13-year-old Northern Ireland schoolboy Darren
Fawns.
The RUC scoured a golf course in Antrim, near Lough Neagh, for the
second time in in 24 hours as the hunt continued for his killer.
The body of Darren, from Repulse Court, Antrim, has still not been
released by the authorities, so the funeral -- originally planned for
today -- cannot go ahead.

LORD Lever, a Labour Cabinet Minister and economic adviser to former
Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1970s, died at
his home in London yesterday, his private secretary Betty Payton said.
He was 81.
Harold Lever served as an MP in central Manchester for 34 years until
1979, when he was made a life peer.
He was widely acknowledged to be a Labour paradox -- a millionaire and
financial wizard who was a witty and erudite exponent of
socialist-capitalist principles.
His expertise led him to become Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
in 1974 and Mr Harold Wilson's personal financial adviser and negotiator
of Britain's North Sea oil contracts.
Lord Lever went on to advise Mr James Callaghan, who was Prime
Minister from 1976 until his defeat by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1979
General Election.
Born to a Jewish family in Manchester in 1914, Lord Lever's socialist
beliefs never prevented him enjoying his wealth, which he accrued as a
lawyer and as a shrewd stock- market investor.
He and his third wife Diane, a Lebanese-born millionairess by whom he
had three daughters, lived in a 22-room apartment in central London.
Lord Lever, always on the right, pro-European wing of Labour, was
elected as shadow front-bench spokesman on European Affairs when the
party went into opposition in 1970.
He resigned two years later over Labour's stance on joining the EEC.
He was re-elected to the shadow Cabinet later that year, speaking for
trade and industry, and went on to become Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster when Labour returned to power in 1974.
Although frequently under fire from left-wingers in the party who
accused him of lacking commitment to socialism, Lord Lever insisted he
had been a radical throughout his life.
Lord Lever also had a daughter by his second wife, Billie, who died in
1948. His first marriage was dissolved.
In a tribute, Labour MP Gerald Kaufman said: ''Harold Lever was one of
the most brilliant Members of Parliament the Labour Party has ever had.
''He had a dazzling brain and a superb wit.''
Former Lords opposition leader Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos said Lord Lever
was one of the most significant politicians of the post-war period.
''He was a charming companion and will be much missed.''

A BRIDE has had to get married a second time after finding out she was
still married to her first husband when she took her vows.
When Kirsten Stewart wed soldier Patrick O'Neill five years ago, the
divorce from the husband of her previous marriage had not been
finalised.
At the time, she had been assured that her divorce had gone through
but an administrative error meant the process had not been completed.
In the eyes of the law, her second marriage did not count and was
possibly even bigamous.
Her wedding to Mr O'Neill, 35, took place at Haddington Register
Office on July 27, 1990.
The marriage certificate listed her parents as local architect Colin
Stewart and his wife Agnes, of Gifford House, Gifford Gate, Haddington.
Mr O'Neill's parents, believed to be from Greenock, were named as
retired seaman Michael O'Neill and his wife Elizabeth.
The couple celebrated with their witnesses, J Martin of Glenhoven
Road, North Carbrain, Cumbernauld, and Lee Wilson, of Malta Green,
Stockbridge, Edinburgh.
Then the couple set off for a new life at 14 Field Royal Artillery,
Salisbury, and started a family.
It was only after her first husband remarried that Mrs O'Neill, 27,
realised with a shock that the date of her divorce was after the date of
her wedding to Patrick O'Neill.
Almost five years to the day since their first ceremony, the couple
returned to Haddington Register Office and got married again on July 28.
They held a celebration at a local restaurant with Mrs O'Neill's
parents and witnesses Alan Turner and his wife Pamela of Acredales,
Haddington.
''I thought it was quite funny really,'' said Mrs O'Neill back at home
in Larkhill, Salisbury.
Mr O'Neill, now a sergeant-major, said: ''We have been told by court
officials in Edinburgh that our child's status has not been affected.''
Crown Office officials considered a report sent to them but accepted
that there had been a genuine mistake. They decided to take no action.

<HEADLINE>Saga's cruise offer for American widow</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN elderly widow who cancelled a Hebridean holiday when her husband
died -- and was then sued for the full cost of the trip, has been
offered a trip by another company.
Mrs Frances Stout, an 84-year-old American, decided she could not go
ahead with her visit to the Hebrides after her husband, John, died of a
heart attack.
The couple had already paid a deposit of #1280 to Hebridean Island
Cruises, which offered its sympathies but then sued her for the full
cost of the holiday -- almost #7500 plus legal costs.
The case was settled last month, just before it was due to be heard at
Central London County Court. Mrs Stout, from Hartford, Connecticut,
agreed to pay the outstanding balance and the company, based in Skipton,
Yorkshire, bore its own legal costs.
Now, Mrs Stout -- a grandmother of seven -- has been offered a similar
Scottish islands cruise by Saga.
She said she was ''disappointed'' at the first company's legal action
and was accepting the Saga offer. ''It was extremely sympathetic and
kind,'' she said.
A Saga spokesman said the offer was made because it ''felt Mrs Stout's
case was most unfortunate''. It could not have happened with one of its
own holidays because cancellation insurance was always included.
The trip is for two people on the cruise ship Explorer in spring 1996,
plus two air tickets. The total value is about #6500.

LOCH Lomond's most distinguished visitors yesterday were former

Although Luss Gala Day may not have the same ring to it as, say, the
Braemar Gathering, nevertheless Mr Carter took a stroll around in the
sunshine.
As Niall Colquhoun, general manager of the Lodge on Loch Lomond Hotel,
where the Carters stayed the night, said: ''Although he is 71 years old,
and only flew in this morning, he had a good brisk walk. His security
people looked more breathless than he did.''
To help make his future walking a bit easier, Niall's father Alan

his stay.

A STREET in Wester Hailes council housing estate in Edinburgh has
beaten off stiff competition to take first prize in a national design
contest.
The judges of the Local Government News Street Design Competition,
which is open to local authorities, new towns and urban development
corporations, chose Wester Hailes Drive as the winner for its
environmental improvements.
The estate on the west of the city was originally built nearly 30
years ago.
The area was declared an urban partnership by the Scottish Office in
1990 and, since then, Edinburgh District Council, Lothian Regional
Council, Scottish Homes, and local tenants have been working together to
address its problems.
Wester Hailes Drive, consisting of 460 houses, predominantly terraced
four or five storey dwellings, had specific difficulties such as lack of
security and inadequate provision of greenery.
Much of the area surrounding the housing was under tarmac and
residents had described it as living in ''an urban desert''.
Local neighbourhood councils formed a development group and
improvements have included front and rear garden areas, the provision of
children's play areas, traffic calming measures, and new high security
windows.
Councillor Mary Mulligan, district council housing committee convener,
said: ''We were up against some strong competition but were confident
the improvement work carried out in the area was worthy of such
recognition.''

THE first woman to walk around the world said yesterday she would
rather have been driving fast cars.
Ffyona Campbell also admitted she was self-centred and selfish and
that she had considered committing suicide at one point during the
20,000-mile trek.
Speaking to psychiatrist Dr Anthony Clare, in his series In the
Psychiatrist's Chair on BBC Radio 4, she said: ''It never actually
entered my mind that I was doing this because I like doing it. I didn't
like doing it.
''I had this notion that what you should do in life is what you don't
like doing. I don't like walking -- I like driving fast cars.''
At one point on her epic journey, she felt she could not go on any
more after spending 11 years of her life on the road. It was on the last
lap as she sat on a beach in France that she felt despair.
''I nearly didn't get through Europe,'' she said. ''There was a time
on the beach in France . . . the BBC came and showed me the episode they
had done and I watched 11 years of my life and it really hurt.
''They left and I was in my bunker with my pot of pills.''
She said went into her tent to write farewell notes.
''Then two girls from Raleigh International came into my bunker --
they'd been looking for me for two days. They came bursting in with all
these plans they had for the walk and they were so enthusiastic. They
have no idea what they did by coming in at that point.''
Ffyona insisted she had benefited from her experiences and had learned
humility since her return.
''I was supremely selfish. I don't remember doing anything to help
somebody or to make them happy before I was about 25 . . . I didn't
realise you get so much back.''

<HEADLINE>Adams 'won't die or kill for Ireland'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINN Fein president Gerry Adams admitted yesterday that he had no
desire to die or kill for Ireland.
He also admitted that his first sexual fumblings were with Protestant
girls who lived near his Ballymurphy home in Belfast.
Mr Adams, 46, was interviewed by Professor Anthony Clare for a new
Scottish Television series being broadcast on ITV.
The Sinn Fein president looked relaxed as Prof Clare asked searching
questions about his childhood, family, and involvement in politics.
Mr Adams was asked if he was personally at risk in his attempt to push
forward the peace process in Northern Ireland.
He replied: ''We only have one life each of us and we have to use it
in this type of risky escapade.
''We Irish Republicans have taken on the British Government. Many of
my good friends and associates have left me, walked around the corner
and have been killed.
''I have no desire to die for Ireland, or to kill for Ireland. I have
to keep coming back to the British Government, to what should be the
biggest priority on this island. We need to move the peace process
forward so that this type of conversation no longer matters any more.''
Mr Adams said he came from a very poor family and grew up in the Falls
Road area of Belfast and later at Ballymurphy.
His family was political, both maternal and paternal grandparents were
from a Republican socialist background.
However, until his early teens, he was unaware of politics, he said.
In his teens, he learned that his uncle had to migrate because he
could not get work and that the Royal Ulster Constabulary was not so
much a police force as a force in the service of the state.
Prof Clare asked what contact he had had with Protestants.
Mr Adams replied: ''When I was in Ballymurphy as a teenager and we
began to discover there was such a thing as sex and there was the
opposite sex, our first fumbling explorations were in the Moyard area
which was a Loyalist area and our first encounters with young women were
with Protestant young women -- simply because they were just across the
road from where we were.''
Prof Clare asked if he had been a member of the IRA in the early 1970s
-- and if not, why not.
Mr Adams replied: ''First of all, it's an illegal thing to join the
IRA. The history of these times will have to be told sometime when it is
not illegal.
''But my move into politics was quite a gradual one. It was via
housing action committees.''
He was also a founder member of the Civil Rights Association.
Prof Clare asked repeatedly how Mr Adams felt about the use of
violence.
''I wonder whether you as a person actually dislike physical action or
violence?'' he said.
Mr Adams replied: ''I think any sensible person must be both
intellectually and emotionally against being involved or a player in
violence.''
Prof Clare asked whether violence had an attraction for some people.
Mr Adams said: ''Well, there may well be people of the kind you
describe but I can only describe my experiences as a Republican
activist. Of all the people I have met in the last 23 years, I have met
no-one attracted to physical force.
''What is important now is we have an opportunity to set all that
behind us. I am prepared to sit down and speak to the people who shot
me.''
He added that Prof Clare seemed preoccupied in the interview with
physical violence.
''We have persuaded the physical force people in the Republican
family, we have persuaded the IRA to stop. If I had told you a year ago
that the IRA would have stopped for a full year and John Major's
Government would not have started proper talks you would have dismissed
it as Republican propaganda,'' he said.
* An opinion poll published yesterday revealed that more than 50% of
people interviewed said that they did not trust or like Mr Adams.
Only 25% felt he was a man of peace but nearly half of those
questioned said they thought he was very important to the outcome of the
Northern Ireland peace process.
The poll was conducted by NOP Consumer Market Research on behalf of
Scottish Television. Interviews took place between July 28 and 30. More
than 1000 adults were interviewed in Great Britain.
* Prime Minister John Major and Mr Adams are to be jointly cited in a
peace prize being awarded this month, just three days ahead of the IRA
ceasefire's first anniversary.
Together with former Irish premier Albert Reynolds and Northern
Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party chief John Hume, Mr Major
and Mr Adams are getting the award from a summer school being staged in
the west of Ireland.
Mr Major will be the only one of the four not to be at the
presentation in Killala, County Mayo. An official from the British
Embassy in Dublin is likely to receive the citation on behalf of the
Prime Minister.
Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds, and Mr Hume will speak about the Northern
Ireland peace process near the close of the four-day Humbert Summer
School -- named after a French general who led an abortive invasion of
Ireland at Killala in the late eighteenth century.
The event will bring together at a significant time the men whose
historic three-way handshake on the steps of Dublin's government
buildings soon after the start of the ceasefire was regarded as a key
part of the continuing peace process.
Although Mr Major will miss the Killala event, he is expected to be in
Ireland a few days later, meeting Irish Prime Minister John Bruton in
Dublin for a UK-Irish summit examination of progress being made by the
peace process.

A JUDGE ruled yesterday that a Renfrewshire man, evicted along with
members of his family on Saturday, could return to his home.
Lord Gill continued an interim interdict, which he had granted on
Saturday, preventing Glasgow Airport Ltd and sheriff officers from
taking any action to remove Mr Tony Chalk from his flat in Douglas
Terrace, Abbotsinch.
The terrace is to be demolished to make way for an airport extension.
Glasgow Airport has served a compulsory purchase order on the flat
and, on Saturday, sheriff officers called at the premises, broke down
the door, and evicted the family.
The interim interdict will remain in force until Glasgow Airport,
which was not represented at yesterday's hearing -- a rare sitting of
Scotland's Court of Session on a Sunday -- decides to respond.
Mr John Mayer, counsel for Mr Chalk, said after the hearing: ''The
eviction was no eviction at all in law.''
Mr Chalk later told how he was in bed on Saturday morning when the
sheriff officers arrived ''unexpectedly''. He claimed he had been given
several weeks notice to leave his flat.
He said that, despite his own solicitor telling the sheriff officers
on Saturday that they were acting illegally and that a petition was
being put before a Court of Session judge that day, the eviction went
ahead.
Lord Gill was told yesterday that the interim interdict order had been
served on both Glasgow Airport and the sheriff officers' firm on
Saturday night.
The judge was told that Mr Chalk and his family did not get back into
their home on Saturday night.
Mr Mayer said it was a matter of luck that the petitioner's daughter
and her days-old baby were not there when the door was broken down.
''Mr Chalk was not given time to locate the shirt in which he kept his
weekly earnings and had to borrow money.''
Mr Mayer said it was possible for the family to go back in to the
house, although it did not have a door. ''However, the petitioner
understands how to use a hammer and nails and can secure his house.''
Scottish Airports said it would be consulting its legal advisers to
consider its next move.
''This has been going on for two-and-a-half years,'' said a spokesman.
''Almost everyone has settled except Mr Chalk, who had been holding out
for some considerable time.''

<HEADLINE>Young ignore deadly threat of skin cancer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977010831</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIX young scots have died and around 100 have developed serious skin
cancer in the space of five years, according to the Scottish Cancer
Intelligence Unit.
The deaths, four of them under 20, were a result of malignant melanoma
-- the most dangerous type of skin cancer.
According to Cancer Research Campaign, malignant melanoma has become
the second most common cancer in women under 35 -- exceeded only by
cervical cancer. For young men of the same age group, it is now the
sixth most common -- after testes, Hodgkins disease, less serious skin
cancers, non Hodgkins lymphoma, and brain tumours.
So, with such damning evidence that skin cancer has become bad news
for the young, why are health promotions not working? The link between
exposure to the sun and skin cancer was made and warnings first given in
the early 1950s.
Professor Rona MacKie of Glasgow University, a leading world expert,
believes that people ignore skin cancer warnings in the way they ignore
smoking ones.
''We always have a patient in their twenties in our wards who won't
survive another year,'' she revealed.
''It is clear that skin cancer is evident in the young. Unfortunately,
many people are reluctant to think a few years ahead. Sadly, for some,
skin cancer arises sooner rather than later.''
According to Ms Jean King, head of education for Cancer Research, 18%
of malignant melanomas in the UK are found in the 15 to 39 age group,
whereas only 4% of all other malignant neoplasms are found in the under
40s. CRC believes more than 90% of cases are sporadic (environmental)
and less than 10% are clusters with family associations.
Professor MacKie, who believes the cause lies in the way UV radiation
hits the nucleus of the cells, said: ''The pattern of behaviour seems to
be that because Scotland may have a poor spring and then a burst of
sunshine, there are those who feel they must get out and enjoy every
last minute of it, fearing next week it might rain.''
Dr Niall Coggans, a psychologist at the department of pharmacology at
Strathclyde University, believes many young people are not considering
the possibility of cancer in early adulthood.
''The problem with skin cancer is that the perception of risk is
distant rather than close. The message is not getting through. When you
are 16 years, 25 seems old.''
Scotland is top of the UK table for malignant melanoma in the young
and, in the wider European picture, fifth for women behind Norway,
Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland, and eighth for men behind Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, France, and Germany.
Ms King believes the accurate picture of Scotland is clouded by very
good registration of skin cancer figures in comparison with other areas.
''But the pale skin colour of the average Scot undoubtedly puts them at
risk from skin cancer.''
Sunbeds have been used by a significant proportion of Professor
MacKie's patients.

<HEADLINE>Farmer to take out private action against police who signed car dealer's planning affidavits. Prosecution bid in planning row</HEADLINE>

A FARMER is to pursue a private prosecution against two police
officers who signed affidavits containing incorrect information.
It will be the first time in Scottish legal history that such an
action against members of the police force has been attempted.
The farmer has also called for a full inquiry into a series of
planning applications by a second-hand car dealer after the policemen
signed the affidavits on the dealer's behalf.
The officers claim that they were unaware of the full implications of
the documents, which falsely stated that an area of farmland had been
continuously used for a motor salvage and sales business for more than
25 years.
Strathclyde Police and the Crown Office have refused to act against
the officers.
Poultry farmer Tommy Wardrop, 50, has lived at Daltippen Farm, a mile
south of Girvan, Ayrshire, for more than 40 years, co-existing with his
neighbour who owns the Bynehill caravan site. Their diverse activities
were separated by a field and burn.
However, in 1990, the relationship soured, when the site owner's son,
Mr John McKechan, 38, expanded his Speedlift Auto Salvage business from
a shed on the caravan site to a field adjoining Mr Wardrop's farm,
erected a warehouse, and altered the course of the burn to extend his
car compound.
He applied for an Established Use Certificate, supported by 14
affidavits swearing that the business of storage and sale of motor
vehicles and caravans had been carried on continuously on the plot of
land south of the burn since the early 1960s.
The signatories included his father, serving Police Constable Ian
Hamilton, and a retired police officer Alan Ross.
Mr McKechan Sr declared that he had started the storage and car
business on the land in 1950.
Mr Hamilton and Mr Ross both confirmed the continuous use of the land
for the motor business since 1963. Mr Hamilton's affidavit included a
plan showing the exact site referred to by Mr McKechan.
Mr Wardrop maintains that the field has been used as a vehicle salvage
pound only since 1990 and he has spent more than #20,000 in legal fees
trying to prove that Mr McKechan and the two policemen have broken the
law.
A series of photographs taken between 1973 and 1992 show the area has
not been used for the purposes alleged by Mr McKechan until recent
years.
Mr Bob Sykes, a local vet, lived at Daltippen between 1976 and 1980
and says: ''When we stayed there, there was no car activity at all and
certainly no vehicles on the land south of the burn.''
Mr Ross, who was an officer in the area in the early 1960s, tells The
Herald that the affidavit was confusing.
''In the 1960s, there were often half a dozen vehicles where the hut
is,'' he affirmed, ''and that was what I was signing for. As far as I
can remember, there was not a salvage business nor vehicles on the other
side of the burn -- that developed later over the years.''
Mr Hamilton, who retired from the police two years ago, says: ''I
bought two cars from old Mr McKechan back in 1963 -- I worked for a
mechanic before I entered the police force.
''As for the affidavit, I never said the business was operating on the
other side of the burn . . . I wish I had never signed that thing.''
Angered by questions over whether the land south of the burn had been
used for a car sales business for more than 25 years, Mr McKechan says:
''As far as I am aware, it has.''
On August 13, 1990, Mr McKechan lodged his application for an
Established Use Certificate for car sales at Bynehill.
The affidavits, which amount to sworn statements in Scots law, were
used in support.
On January 9, 1991, the council's planning department recommended
acceptance. However, after representations from Mr Wardrop, the matter
was suspended.
District councillor Straun Stevenson, now the Conservative prospective
parliamentary candidate for Dumfries, said he found the recommendation
of approval ''quite extraordinary''.
He expressed ''alarm'' that land adjacent to Mr Wardrop's farm had
been suddenly ''packed with over 80 scrapped vehicles'' and demanded
that enforcement action should be taken to return it to agricultural
use.
Councillor James Boyle said the land had been used as a vehicle yard
for only ''a year or two'' and the large shed had appeared during that
period of time.
On January 29, 1991, Mr McKechan's application was refused by the
council on the recommendation of its legal adviser.
Councillor Danny McNeill says: ''I don't know who advised him to apply
for established use as there was no way the land had been used for his
business for the prescribed period of time.''
He lodged an appeal against the planning refusal, then sisted it
pending a separate application for retrospective planning consent on the
annexed part of the caravan park.
Officials recommended refusal on the grounds that the application ran
contrary to the local plan and had a detrimental effect on the rural
amenity.
However, the application was granted by a meeting of the planning
sub-committee in April 1992.
Mr McKechan also applied for a second-hand car dealer's licence. Again
the affidavits were used in support.
The application was refused by the council on August 31, 1990, but, on
appeal to Ayr Sheriff Court, was granted ''on a technicality''.
Mr Wardrop and his solicitor, Mr Joe Baxter, are furious that the
motor trader has secured both planning permission and a dealer's licence
on the back of incorrect legal statements.
A complaint to Mr Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of Strathclyde, over
the action of Mr Hamilton was dismissed after an internal inquiry.
A police spokesman said: ''The matter was fully investigated and
adjudicated by Strathclyde Police. No fresh inquiry is taking place.''
A complaint to the procurator-fiscal service was also refused.
Last September, Mr Baxter appealed to the Crown Office. He said the
signing of the affidavits was a ''very serious matter'' and merited a
''complete investigation and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings''.
In reply, the Crown accepted that the ''affidavits were at least
potentially misleading''.
However, it decided to take no action on the grounds that the fiscal
was ''entitled to exercise his discretion''.
Mr Wardrop said last night he would take civil action to pursue a
private prosecution against the police officers concerned.

Hiroshima, Sunday
THE Mayor of Hiroshima today apologised for Japan's actions during the
Second World War.
Takashi Hiraoka said the suffering of all the war's victims was
''indelibly etched in our hearts. We want to apologise for the
unbearable suffering that Japanese colonial domination and war inflicted
on so many people.''
His apology, which broke with tradition, came at a ceremony to mark
the fiftieth anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb.
The event began with the flutter of 1500 doves and the symbolic
collapse to the ground by anti-nuclear activists.
The smell of incense drifted over Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park as
13,000 seated guests and tens of thousands more observed a minute's
silence as a bell tolled at the exact time, 8:15am, when the world
entered the era of nuclear war. Officials said about 100,000 people
attended today's event.
The officials said the mayor, a former journalist, wanted to use the
symbolism of the 50th anniversary to make a healing gesture which
crossed national boundaries. He called for the elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
The occasion was particularly poignant because of recent Chinese
atomic tests and France's decision to resume nuclear testing later this
year.
The mayor called for an immediate nuclear test ban and establishment
of a new nuclear-free zone in the Asia-Pacific region.
Calling nuclear arms ''clearly inhumane weapons in obvious violation
of international law'', Hiraoka urged Japan to play a leading role in
abolishing them.
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama singled out China and France
for criticisms about their nuclear programmes.
''Nuclear weapon states should make every effort to reduce nuclear
armaments; the recent nuclear test performed by China and the decision
made by France to resume nuclear tests are extremely regrettable, and we
have strongly urged them to cease nuclear testing and to withdraw the
decision,'' he said.
Socialist Prime Minister Murayama, who only managed to push through a
parliamentary resolution expressing ''reflection,'' made no mention of
Japanese actions during the war in his speech.
Hibakusha, or atomic-bomb survivors, from Brunei, China, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and North and South Korea were among the invited guests. UN
Under-Secretary General Joseph Reed, an American, was the only foreigner
among the speakers.
The ceremony also drew peace and anti-nuclear activists from around
the world to Hiroshima, now a bustling modern city of one million.
Fifty years ago the city was a wasteland where 140,000 died on the
bomb's impact, or from radiation diseases in the ensuing years. --

Kinshasa, Sunday
SIX Italians, including two children aged five and 11, have been
murdered near a wildlife reserve in eastern Zaire.
A security source at nearby Goma said: ''The information we have
received is that six Italians were murdered at Maiomoto near the Virunga
National Park.
''We don't know all the details yet, but the governor has gone to the
area to find out.''
The Italian foreign ministry in Rome confirmed two of those killed
were children.
A report on TG4, a newscast on private network Rete Quattro, said the
attack took place in an area known to be the territory of armed bands
who crossed in from Rwanda.
The Italian news agency ANSA reported that two of the adults worked
for the charity Giusto Mondo (Just World).
Domenico Colombo, president of the non-governmental agency, told RAI
television that the wife of one of the dead men, and mother of the two
children, was injured and in shock.
''Since it was a Sunday they decided to leave their operational
headquarters and visit the Virunga park which is an animal reserve,'' he
said.
''After a few kilometres they were blocked by an armed band.
''The band first robbed them and then fired at the group itself,
killing one of our volunteers, architect Adelio Castiglione, and his two
children, Roberta and Samuele.''
He named the others who were killed as land surveyor Michelangelo
Lamberti, construction foreman Tarcisio Riva, and electrician Luigi
Cazzaniga.
Colombo said the Italians had been working on aid projects to help
Rwandan refugees and locals in eastern Zaire.
Local people in the Virunga park area, about 1000 miles from the
capital Kinshasa, said they suspected the Italians were killed by
poachers or robbers.
Virunga is Zaire's finest game park and home to one of the rare
surviving groups of mountain gorillas and other wildlife.
The park has been badly hit by poaching, particularly with the influx
of more than one million refugees into the area from civil war last year
in neighbouring Rwanda.
Many of the refugees were soldiers in the Rwandan army which fled
after losing the civil war to guerrillas. Many of the soldiers took
their weapons with them into Zaire.
Zairean soldiers are also accused of taking advantage of the general
insecurity in the area to kill park animals for meat or ivory.

DAR ES SALAAM, Sunday
BANDITS who abducted five Americans in a national park drugged them
unconscious before dumping them in the bush and driving off with their
car, the US Embassy said today.
The Americans -- three missionaries and two 10-year-old girls -- were
found semiconscious but healthy this morning by a search party of
Tanzanian police and park rangers, said embassy duty officer Charlene
Lamb.
The motive for the kidnapping was not immediately known, but the
bandits may have wanted their four-wheel-drive vehicle, a prized item in
a country with extremely bad roads.
Four gunmen abducted the Americans on Saturday in the Mikumi National
Park, about 110 miles southwest of the Indian Ocean port of Dar es
Salaam, Lamb said.
The Americans were identified as Sandy Harrington, 35, of Richmond,
Virginia and her daughter Christine, 10; David and Millie Moreland, 50
and 43, of Monroe, Louisiana; and Joanna Giddens, 10.
Joanna is a friend of Christine's whose parents are missionaries in
the northeastern town of Moshi, near Mount Kilimanjaro.
The Americans had stopped their vehicle -- a white Nissan -- briefly
when the gunmen emerged from the bush, Lamb said. Mrs. Harrington's
husband, William, had gotten out of the car and was not abducted.
The bandits commandeered the car and drove off with the five Americans
inside.
Mark Kelly, a spokesman for the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern
Baptist Convention, based in Richmond, said the bandits forced the
Americans to take a powder before driving off.
Lamb said they were given a liquid drug. Neither knew what kind of
drug was used.

PROTESTERS around the world marked the anniversary of the Hiroshima
bombing with renewed demonstrations against France's decision to resume
nuclear tests.
''The nuclear bombing of Hiroshima was 50 years ago, but humanity has
still learnt nothing,'' German Friends of the Earth said in a statement
urging French President Jacques Chirac to reverse his policy.
France, whose relations with countries near its South Pacific testing
site have come under severe strain, was quick to dispute such a link.
Youth and Sports Minister Guy Drut said in an open letter to young
people and sportsmen that France's nuclear deterrent was a guarantee of
their future peace.
Linking the French tests with pictures of mushroom clouds in
anti-nuclear propaganda was a deliberate distortion, he said, since the
French explosions took place underground in conditions of total safety.
Some of the biggest rallies were held in Australia, where politicians,
trades union leaders, churchmen, and environmentalists united to condemn
France's nuclear policy.
About 15,000 people marched past the French embassy in Sydney.
Demonstrators in central Brussels commemorated the Hiroshima
anniversary by waving banners reading ''Hiro-Chirac -- stop nuclear
tests''.
In France, environmental groups, left-wing parties, and trade unions
organised rallies but failed to ignite mass indignation against French
tests. Barely 1000 people attended the main rally in Paris.
Pope John Paul II, eschewing any French link but stressing again his
worries about the fighting in former Yugoslavia, said the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had left ''a dramatic mark on the
history of our times''.

SNP leader Alex Salmond has bluntly admitted that his party will lose
the next election unless it finds extra money to try to compete more
effectively with the campaign funding of Labour and the Conservatives.
''If we get outspent to the same level as we did at the last election,
you know, 200 to 1, then we'll lose,'' he stated in an interview with
The Herald.
He concedes that the party lost the Monklands by-election because it
did not give its candidate, Mrs Kay Ulrich, sufficient professional
support, and he is indicating that it is time for the party to target
more professionally key seats at the next election.
In a swipe at the crude jingoism of the past, when the party was
ridiculed for its ''Free by 93'' sloganising, Mr Salmond states it is
time they were ''less trite'' in the way they express themselves.
He even shows guarded respect for Tory Party campaigning at the last
election and admits there are lessons the other parties can take from
the single-mindedness of the Conservatives.
''The success in the Tory Party was in reinforcing organisationally,
and in resource terms, their strongest seats. They did that with a
degree of ruthlessness which caught the other political parties in
Scotland on the hop. We'd written them off. And I think all the other
parties should take lessons from that,'' he said.
He concedes that the SNP's own organisation in key seats at the last
election was less than desired, which would have to be tackled by the
additional funding the party needed.
Mr Salmond is also keen to exploit the claims that the advisers
surrounding Labour leader Tony Blair are less than enthusiastic about
Labour's devolution plans.
He said that if Labour's ''weak and inadequate'' devolution proposals
began to unravel, then Labour's lead in The Herald's System Three
opinion poll could quickly become fragile, giving the SNP a springboard
to real political advance.
He also makes clear that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's more
friendly persona will do little to help the Tory Party in Scotland, as
people still see it as being too heavily dominated by policies from
Southern England.

THE Scottish TUC is to increase its aid to workers in Bosnia following
a visit there last week by deputy general secretary, Mr Bill Spiers.
Mr Spiers was forced to flee Mostar in a UN armoured car because the
city was being shelled.
He will announce details of the new package today in Glasgow. He had
gone to Bosnia with Mr Giampi Alhadeff, of War on Want, at the beginning
of last week with an STUC aid package for miners in Tuzla.
The STUC gave them 10,500 deutschmarks and mining safety equipment
worth #8000. It has already contributed #6000 of food aid.
Mr Spiers said that as they left Mostar eight shells had fallen, and
they had got out of Zagreb on Friday night just before it was attacked.
Mr Spiers said the STUC had been in contact with the miners of Tuzla
for about 18 months. There were two reasons for raising funds for them:
the 13,000 Tuzla miners had contributed a day's pay to British miners
during the 1984/85 strike and, although aid from the humanitarian
organisations went to displaced persons and refugees, there was no aid
for the local population.

Hanover, Sunday
HUNDREDS of punks started to leave the city today after three nights
of rioting, looting, and street battles with 2000 police as a punk
festival wound up.
About 450 youths were detained on the last day of the festival, known
as a ''Chaos Day'', after more overnight clashes.
Residents began to clear up the debris outside their homes, while
convoys of police vans continued to patrol the city.
More than 130 police, and possibly as many punks, were injured in the
street battles that raged into the early hours of the morning.
Police also detained about 70 right-wing extremists in eastern Germany
over the weekend.
Police in Gera detained 35 youths on Friday evening, who were singing
Nazi songs and making the Nazi salute.
In the Berlin suburbs of Erkner and Storkow police found posters on
Saturday commemorating Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess, who killed
himself in Berlin's Spandau jail on August 17, 1987. Two 17-year-olds
were detained for having a T-shirt with a swastika printed on it.
Police in Frankfurt-on Oder said they suspected activists from the
right-wing National Party of Germany (NPD) of having printed a poster
carrying the words: ''Rudolf Hess -- martyr of peace''.
A further 26 people, including the regional leader of the NPD, were
detained in Gotha on Saturday after right-wingers went on the rampage.

<HEADLINE>Crackdown on incompetent doctors planned for NHS</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CRACKDOWN on incompetent doctors will be announced today, with a
medical committee expected to recommend that doctors be forced to report
worries about colleagues endangering patients through wrong diagnosis or
treatment.
Giving his reaction, the secretary of the British Medical Association,
Dr Mac Armstrong, said it would not be something doctors would welcome
but they had to recognise it was about improving patient care.
Dr Armstrong, a former general practitioner in Connel, Argyll, argued
that where mistakes occurred it was rarely due to malice on the doctor's
part and was more usually the result of overwork, bad training, bad
management or the doctor being ill.
Dr Kenneth Calman, the Chief Medical Officer, has chaired a committee
on the subject which will give its recommendations today.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said in a television interview
yesterday that the recommendations would give ''extra teeth and extra
force to what has always been the commitment of the medical profession,
to ensure a continuing commitment to improved medical excellence''.
Mr Dorrell said he had great sympathy with the patients and relatives
affected by the actions of incompetent doctors. ''There is no higher
priority in the health service than the maintenance and development of
professional standards,'' he stated.
Mr Dorrell said, during the programme, that one of his priorities for
the National Health Service was ''that you have to listen more and
explain better''.
He added: ''We have to demonstrate that the health service responds to
the influence of the people who pay for it.
''It is there to serve the patients of the NHS who are taxpayers. We
have to make it more responsive to their views and their priorities.''
His comments immediately came under attack from Labour.
Shadow Health Minister Nick Brown MP described Mr Dorrell as
''desperate to ditch Virginia Bottomley's legacy of appalling public
relations but just as out of touch as his predecessors when it comes to
health policy''.
Another Government measure, the Medical (Professional Performance)
Bill, which would enable the General Medical Council to investigate
cases where a doctor's standard of professional performance is alleged
to be seriously deficient, is currently going through the House of
Lords. It is expected to be on the statute book this autumn.
A spokeswoman for the BMA in Scotland said the medical profession
wanted to deliver a quality service to patients but it was important
that hospital managers realised that professional staff had to be given
adequate study leave to keep up with medical advances.
Fears about over-stressed doctors placing patients at risk have been
highlighted by several recent cases. The latest involved a locum
consultant who was suspended last month amid allegations that hundreds
of patients' tissue samples may have been misdiagnosed.
Dr Samuel Kiberu's work at up to six hospitals over the past three
years, most recently at the Pilgrim Hospital, Boston, Lincolnshire, is
to be investigated.

STRATHCLYDE police have launched a total of six murder investigations
in the Glasgow area following what they describe as ''one of the most
violent weekends in the region for some considerable time''. Another
killing occurred at a Peebles disco.
The Strathclyde deaths came only three days after it was revealed that
crimes of violence in the region had increased by 13%.
A senior detective yesterday blamed the deaths -- in a spate of
separate incidents -- on ''complete, total, and utter lawlessness''
among a small number of people but stressed that the city streets were
safe and there was no need for public alarm.
However, a leading MP warned last night that Glasgow's image of a city
fighting to shake off a history of poverty and violence must be
protected at all costs.
Labour's home affairs spokesman John McFall, who works closely with
Glasgow's safer community projects, said the deaths would only inflict
more harm on the city's reputation and paint a picture of street crime
spiralling out of control.
Police admitted yesterday that the volume of incidents during a
relatively short period of time has stretched their resources, with more
than 80 detectives and uniformed officers involved in the inquiries.
The number of deaths also meant that a series of post-mortem
examinations on the victims was likely to continue into the early hours
of this morning.
Several people yesterday were being held in custody in connection with
three of the incidents and police were withholding the names of some of
the victims until relatives had been informed.
The weekend of violence began around 3am on Saturday when the body of
a 35-year-old man was found in a house at Young Terrace, Springburn.
A 19-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were yesterday in police
custody. They have been charged in connection with the death. Police
said that a report had been submitted to the procurator-fiscal and the
two are expected the appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
At about 8.50pm on Saturday, a 26-year-old man, whose name was being
witheld by police until relatives were informed, was fatally injured
following a disturbance in Stoneside Drive, Thornliebank.
A 28-year-old man was in police custody yesterday in connection with
the death and also is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
Just over an hour later, at 9.55pm on Saturday, a 39-year-old man was
attacked by a man with a bottle or glass tumbler near the entrance to a
close in Sunnylaw Street, Possilpark, and died later in Stobhill
Hospital.
The identity of the victim, who is believed to come from south
Glasgow, was being withheld by police until relatives were informed.
Detective Chief Inspector Kerr Nelson, who is leading the
investigation, said the victim was with a group of people standing or
sitting near the entrance to 35 Sunnylaw Street when a man ''appeared
from nowhere'' and carried out what was apparently an unprovoked attack.
He appealed for witnesses to contact the incident room at Maryhill
police office. Sunnylaw Street was busy at the time of the incident and
the assailant, who ran off in the direction of Saracen Cross, was
described as being 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, and
wearing light clothing.
The fourth incident happened at about 1.20am yesterday when a
46-year-old man was fatally injured following a disturbance in Baldoven
Crescent, Easterhouse.
Police said he had been stabbed and the matter was being treated as
murder.
Three males, aged 21, 17, and 15, were in custody and a report will be
submitted to the procurator-fiscal. They are expected to appear at
Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Donnelly, 29, was fatally stabbed after a
disturbance around 3.05am yesterday on a stairway at multi-storey flats
near his home in Petershill Court, Balornock.
The sixth incident happened at about 4am yesterday in Alexander
Street, Clydebank, when three men were attacked by a group of youths.
Two of the three, Mr Brian McVicar, 20, of Wood Quadrant, Clydebank,
and a friend, Mr Edward Brown, 17, also of Wood Quadrant, sustained
multiple injuries.
Both were taken to the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, where Mr McVicar
later died. Mr Brown was said to be in a satisfactory condition.
Detective Inspector Willie Ross said it was an apparently motiveless
attack and appealed to taxi drivers, who were in Alexander Street at the
time of the incident, or anyone else who may have witnessed the attack
to contact the police.
In another incident, Mr John Paul Carlton, 29, of Maple Court,
Cumbernauld, was seriously injured when he was attacked by two males in
Millcroft Road, Cumbernauld, at about 2am yesterday.
He was said to be in a stable condition at Monklands General Hospital.
A 21-year-old man was in custody and is expected to appear at Airdrie
Sheriff Court today.)
Detective Superintendent James Crawford, who is overseeing
investigations into all six fatal incidents, yesterday described it as
''a particularly violent weekend'' but said that there was ''no evidence
whatsoever to indicate that there is gang warfare on the streets of
Glasgow''.
He said: ''I have no doubt that there was a degree of drink and drugs
as perhaps a contributory factor in some of the cases but, overall, I
would put it down to a case of complete, total, and utter, lawlessness
on a very, very small minority of the public out there who have a
complete disregard for lives and law and order.''
Appealing to any witnesses to contact their nearest police office or
call the Crimestoppers telephone service (0800 555 111), Mr Crawford
said: ''It would be fair to say that resources are at the moment
stretched between our Major Crime Resource Unit and a mixture of CID and
uniformed officers who are coping.''
Meanwhile, detectives were called to a disco at an ex-servicemen's
club in Peebles early yesterday after a 23-year-old man was found
bleeding to death with a stab wound.
Police said a 30-year-old man from Lanarkshire had been charged in
connection with the incident. He is expected to appear at Jedburgh
Sheriff Court today.

A VAST exodus of people fleeing a Croatian army advance into rebel
Serb Krajina swamped northern Bosnia yesterday and threatened to become
a humanitarian disaster, aid workers said.
Meanwhile, the attention of Bosnian Serb leaders was distracted by a
power struggle between political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army
commander, General Ratko Mladic, with moves that could be a prelude to a
military coup.
Serb refugee agencies have told the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees that 120,000 people are already on the move and another
90,000 still inside Croatia are trying to flee.
Vladimir Tsourko, head of the UNHCR office at Banja Luka in Serb-held
northern Bosnia said: ''We can confirm there are many tens of thousands
of people on the move in Bosnia.''
Tsourko said it could be the largest population movement in the four
years of war in Yugoslavia.
Estimates of the numbers fleeing from Croatia into Bosnia were
difficult to confirm as there was no verified figure for the population
of Krajina.
''The roads are all blocked by people and cars. Our assessment team
could not move beyond Prijedor. It is impossible to count how many
people there are,'' Tsourko said.
Serb media put the number of new refugees in Bosnia as high as
150,000.
UN officials were trying to open a corridor for 80,000 Croatian Serbs,
trapped in corners of their lost Krajina enclave.
Mr James Kanu, UN spokesman for the northern area of Krajina, said
talks were under way in Zagreb to evacuate Serbs into Bosnia through the
border towns of Dvor in the north and Srb in the south.
The Croatian offensive to regain control over rebel Serb areas has
overrun Krajina in only three days. Most of the enclave's population
appear to have fled rather than live under Zagreb's control.
Tsourko said a long column of cars, tractors, and buses was bringing
people from the rebel Serb ''capital'' of Knin, which fell on Saturday,
towards Banja Luka. A second column was flowing from the south towards
Prijedor, in the north-west.
''We are setting up a massive, massive assistance scheme for these
people,'' said Mr Josue Anselmo, spokesman for the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Belgrade. He said work was hampered
by fears for the safety of ICRC staff.
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told international mediators and
top European Union officials in Geneva he expected 99% of Krajina's
people would flee to Serb-held parts of Bosnia, where United Nations
agencies would have to care for them.
''Krajina no longer exists,'' said Croatian defence ministry spokesman
General Ivan Tolj.
The Krajina Serb collapse could strengthen the Bosnian Serb army,
alleviating its chronic manpower shortage and swinging the war in Bosnia
in the Serb's favour. ''This will seriously alter the balance of power
in Bosnia,'' said Alexander Ivanko, UN spokesman in Sarajevo.
In Washington, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the
United States never encouraged the Croatian offensive but acknowledged
that there could be some advantage in the developments.
''Maybe these circumstances, tragic as they are, will provide a new
basis for a negotiated settlement. We're going to be working on it,'' he
said.
US Secretary of Defence William Perry echoed this viewpoint. ''There
may now be a window of opportunity for a negotiated peace in Bosnia,''
Perry told an audience in Aspen, Colorado.
Perry also reiterated US policy that American troops will not be sent
to Bosnia as ground combat troops.
He said withdrawing UN troops at this time would be a ''grievous
mistake'' in part because it would put ''enormous pressures on the
United States to send in military forces''.
Jubilant Croat troops sealed the fate of Krajina on Saturday when they
captured Knin, its symbolic heart, and hoisted their flag over the town.
Government forces, who admitted they suffered heavy casualties in
street fighting, took Petrinja just 30 miles south-east of the capital
Zagreb, early yesterday.
Croatian troops swept forward throughout the day, rolling over towns
with Serb majority populations for hundreds of years and capturing a
strategic air base and the tourist resort of Plitvice Lakes.
Croatian Defence Minister Ivan Tolj said all Serb soldiers should
abandon the fight and would receive an amnesty if they were not ''war
criminals''.
Croatian radio said Bosnian troops were advancing out of the Bihac
enclave into Krajina to link with their Croat allies. Rebel Muslims, who
fought with the Krajina Serbs, were surrendering in droves.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman visited the captured rebel
''capital'' of Knin.
''This means more than just conquering Croatian lands, this means the
creation of conditions for the stability of the Croatian state for
centuries to come,'' Tudjman said in a statement broadcast by Croatian
television.
The retaking of Krajina leaves Eastern Slavonia as the only major area
of Croatia still in Serb hands.
The simmering power struggle between Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko Mladic, a popular hero to
his troops, erupted in the open over the weekend.
The open clash between the two leading Bosnian Serb figures represents
a rift between a faction supported by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and hardline nationalists supporting Karadzic.
Mladic has rejected a move by Karadzic to demote him. Bosnian Serb
army commanders backed the rebellion against political control in an
open letter to the Bosnian Serb assembly which was meeting to discuss
the issue.
Obedient parliamentary deputies, accused by Mladic of war
profiteering, raised the stakes by supporting Karadzic.
However, without the support of top commanding officers, Karadzic is
unlikely to remain in power long and could be ousted by Mladic in what
ranking sources in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale said would amount
to a military coup.
Last Tuesday, Milosevic bypassed Karadzic and addressed a public
appeal to make peace to Mladic and to Bosnia's Muslim President Alija
Izetbegovic.

Bogota, Sunday
POLICE have captured Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the second most
important leader of the Cali drugs cartel, during a raid on an apartment
building in Cali.
The drugs lord was captured with four other people during a raid
involving 500 officers on a building in an exclusive residential
neighbourhood of the southwestern city at dawn today, a police spokesman
said.
It is the strongest blow against the cartel since the capture in June
of Rodriguez Orejuela's older brother, Gilberto, the top leader of the
organisation which is said to control most of the world's illegal
cocaine trade.
Police showed a pale and handcuffed Rodriguez Orejuela, 51, to
journalists at their headquarters in Bogota minutes after flying him
into the capital from Cali.
Rodriguez Orejuela, who had a #1m bounty on his head for drug
trafficking and illicit enrichment and other crimes, had reportedly
taken charge of the cartel following his brother's capture.
The gang leaders had sought respectability in recent years, building
up a business empire of car dealerships, drugstore chains, real estate,
and farmland.
Miguel studied law and was a bank president at one point.
Married to a former beauty queen, he is said to be fiercely loyal to
his family and was obsessed by his security.
He reportedly suffers from a heart condition, and police searched
hundreds of rooms in a Cali hospital last week, believing he was seeking
treatment there.
The government had planned to try him in absentia this year.
However, that effort ran into trouble when two top judicial officials
were arrested and accused of planning to manipulate the trial in his
favor.
In less than two months, the anti-drug team has practically dismantled
the cartel by capturing or forcing to surrender nearly all of its
leaders as well as raiding front companies, seizing documents, and
arresting suspected accomplices.
Helmer Herrera Buitrago is the only leader who remains at large.
His lawyers are reported to be currently negotiating his surrender
with government prosecutors.
Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela's capture comes amid one of the country's
worst political crises.
President Ernesto Samper's election campaign stands accused of
receiving huge donations from the Cali cartel.
However, a Reuters photographer said that Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela
yelled to journalists before being taken away: ''I have not given money
to anyone. President Samper is an honest man. It is all Medina's
invention.''
Police said they knocked down the front door of Rodriguez Orejuela's
10th-floor apartment, rushed inside and caught him as he was about to
hide in a secret compartment in a wardrobe in the master bedroom.
''He was half asleep. He was very confused,'' he said. ''He did not
resist arrest.''

A 10-POINT action plan to improve the state of Scotland's housing and
combat homelessness has been presented to Scottish Housing Minister
Raymond Robertson by Shelter (Scotland).
The proposals include action to help people sleeping rough and to
tackle youth homelessness.
Shelter stresses the urgency of the Minister issuing a revised code of
guidance to the new unitary local authorities to help them respond to
homelessness.
Over the next five years, Shelter also wants to see an additional
#580m a year spent to help provide 13,000 affordable houses and to
tackle dampness and disrepair.
The housing pressure group says it wrote to Mr Robertson the day after
he was appointed, urging him to make homelessness his priority.
It is now putting forward the 10-point plan to the Minister to mark
the end of his first month in office.
Shelter claims it offers him a unique opportunity to stamp his
personality on his post.
Acting director Elaine Rosie said: ''Last year, 12,000 Scots came to
Shelter's housing aid centres looking for help with housing problems.
''In the same year, 43,000 households, equivalent to the population of
Paisley, applied to councils as homeless. Homeless people have few ways
of making their concerns known to decision-makers.''
Shelter's action plan says a special effort must be made to end
reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people and to
replace it with high-quality alternatives.
0   Authorities should also be encouraged to provide accommodation and
support for young homeless people and particularly those leaving care.

<HEADLINE>Coriander crop could spell the end of annual suffering from oil seed rape</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977010845</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH scientist thinks that crops of coriander could replace oil
seed rape, and bring relief to the thousands who suffer summer misery
when the fields turn bright yellow each May.
Those same fields could turn snow-white in the summer with the flowers
of coriander. The thick pollen of the rape flower would be replaced with
a whiff of spice.
Coriander, first introduced to Britain from the Mediterranean by the
Romans, is also prized for its medicinal properties -- the seeds of the
coriander are regarded as a cure for flatulence.
Scientists say that the seeds, used commercially as an ingredient in
curries, can yield natural oils needed to make nylon and detergent and
save Britain a #120m annual imports bill for coconut oil.
Now they are working to improve the existing coriander strains by
genetic engineering.
Dr Steve Millam, of the Scottish Crop Research Institute at
Invergowrie, near Dundee, has grown Britain's first field of coriander.
He said: ''We are always looking at ways of diversifying our crops.
Most people are sick and tired of oil seed rape, and, of course, some
people are literally sick of it.
''Coriander does not give off the horrible odour that oil seed rape
does. As well as being environmentally friendly, coriander contains
valuable oils needed for industry.
''Coriander provides possiblities to diversify the agricultural
landscape and boost rural economies.
''It has the potential to take off as a crop because you can extract
oils from it. These can be split into two groups, with half used for
making nylon and half for detergent and soap powder.''
Earlier this year, doctors at the University of Dundee produced the
first study linking oil seed rape to respiratory diseases and
asthma-like symptoms.
Oil seed rape is grown on half-a-million acres in Britain and is worth
#233m to the farming economy.
Dr Millam's colleagues are attempting to engineer a less obnoxious
form of oil seed rape genetically, but he believes that coriander is a
suitable alternative.
He said: ''Genetically engineered oil seed rape is being developed at
the moment. But why bother? Why not grow a few more different crops?
Coriander can be grown on a field scale. It is growing in a field at
Invergowrie, although we still need to improve its oil content.''
Coriander grows wild in the South of England.
The ancient Chinese believed the seeds could confer immortality. They
are used by some distillers to flavour gin, and were once used by vets
as a drug for horses and cattle.
Coriander ''comfits'' -- seeds coated in white sugar, were once sold
by confectioners as a cure for indigestion and flatulence.

<TEXT>
THE ashes of an accomplished mountaineer who had climbed in five
continents were scattered on the summit of his favourite peak at the
weekend.
A moving ceremony to the memory of 35-year-old batchelor John Main,
who died as a result of a motorbike crash on a lonely road in the
Highlands on June 23, was held in bright sunshine on the 4406ft summit
of Ben Nevis.
Mr Main, a native of Dalry, Ayrshire, pioneered a number of new
climbson the 2000ft-high cliffs of Ben Nevis's North Face.
He was particularly known in Scottish climbing circles for night-time
climbs on the ice-covered faces of the Ben, thus taking advantage of
severe frosts.
Several of his colleagues climbed some of his routes, now devoid of
ice, as a tribute, while family members and others, including his father
Hugh, 66, went up the tourist path for the ceremony, held on Saturday
afternoon.
The mountaineer had scaled peaks in North and South America, in
Africa, in Australia, and on New Zealand's Southern Alps, while in
Europe he was an experienced Alpine climber.
He moved from Ayrshire to Fort William 13 years ago to be closer to
his beloved mountains.
Yesterday, his close friend Kate Ward, of from Onich, near Fort
William, said: ''John was known as the 'unspoken hero' of Scottish
mountaineering. He was a very fine technical climber but he never
boasted of putting up new routes.''
TWO people had to be rescued from Ben Nevis at the weekend.
Climber Neil Greenshill, from Walsall, Staffordshire, injured his knee
and was helped off the hill by members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team,
and Mr Graham Cole, 66, of Lancaster was overcome by heat exhaustion.
Both men were treated at Belford Hospital in Fort William.

Legislation is being drawn up by the Movement for Christian Democracy,
according to a report in the Independent on Sunday, for introduction in
the next session of Parliament.
One option being looked at is to make it a criminal offence to cause
pain to the foetus, or requiring women seeking an abortion to sign a

VICTORIOUS Croatian troops were last night mopping up remaining
pockets of Serb resistance in the Krajina enclave, fuelling what the UN
described as the largest refugee movement of the four-year war in former
Yugoslavia.
The rebel Serb fiefdom of Krajina was wiped out in a swift assault by
the Croatian army which seized town after town and expected to wind up
the operation today.
''Krajina no longer exists.,'' Defence Ministry spokesman General Ivan
Tolj told a news conference.
Meanwhile, the attention of Bosnian Serb leaders was distracted by a
power struggle between political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army
commander, General Ratko Mladic, with moves that could be a prelude to a
military coup.
Tony Winton of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in
Zagreb that the current exodus involved 150,000 refugees, the biggest
single movement of people since the war in Yugoslavia broke out four
years ago.
James Kanu, UN spokesman for the northern area of Krajina, said talks
were under way in Zagreb to create ''corridors'' to evacuate Serbs to
Bosnia through the border towns of Dvor and Srb.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman visited the former rebel ''capital''
of Knin which fell to his forces on Saturday.
''This means more than just conquering Croatian lands, this means the
creation of conditions for the stability of the Croatian state for
centuries to come,'' Tudjman said.
''The objective, democratic world is applauding our success, and those
who are not sympathetic to our cause must admit Croatia has become a
regional power without which no international order in this part of
Europe will be possible.''
His triumphant words were bound to be carefully studied also by the
Bosnian government.
The Croatian army yesterday joined up with the Bosnian government
defenders of the northern Bihac enclave.
The United Nations said the Croatian firepower used to seize Knin was
staggering. ''The amount of weaponry and heavy artillery was just
astonishing,'' UN spokesman Alun Roberts said from Knin.
Tolj called on Serbs holding out ''in the name of life and sanity to
surrender. Further resistance is insane''.
Serbs ignored calls to stay but, taken by surprise by the speed and
success of the assault, many found their getaway routes cut.
The attack began at dawn on Friday and left Krajina's estimated
180,000 Serbs homeless and stateless by dusk yesterday.
Escaping Serbs still carrying their guns wanted to keep them until
they reached Dvor, while the Croatians wanted disarming to take place
well before the border at the town of Glina. Serbs also wanted an armed
UN escort, Kanu said.
Vladimir Tsourko, head of the UNHCR office at Banja Luka in Serb-held
northern Bosnia said: ''We can confirm there are many dozens of
thousands of people on the move in Bosnia (out of Croatia).''
''The roads are all blocked by people and cars. It is impossible to
count how many people there are,'' he said.
The tide began to turn against the Serbs when Croatian troops retook
the tiny Western Slavonia enclave in May. It was the army's first
triumph over rebels who rejected Croatia's 1991 secession from
Yugoslavia and seized 30 percent of the country.
The refugees' primary destination -- the Bosnian Serb ''republic'' --
was gripped by a power struggle between army boss General Ratko Mladic
and political chief Radovan Karadzic.
Mladic has rejected a move by Karadzic to demote him. Bosnian Serb
army commanders backed his rebellion and rejected orders by politicians
who Mladic accused of war profiteering.
Parliamentary deputies raised the stakes by supporting Karadzic and
warned that disobedience would be punished.
However, without the support of top commanding officers, Karadzic is
unlikely to remain in power long and could be ousted by Mladic in what
ranking sources in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale said would amount
to a military coup.
Last Tuesday, Milosevic bypassed Karadzic and addressed a public
appeal to make peace to Mladic and to Bosnia's Muslim President Alija
Izetbegovic.
Despite the dispute, favour, the Krajina Serb collapse could
strengthen the Bosnian Serb army, alleviating its chronic manpower
shortage and swinging the Bosnia war in the Serbs' favour.
''This will seriously alter the balance of power in Bosnia,'' said
Alexander Ivanko, United Nations spokesman in Sarajevo.
In Washington, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the
United States never encouraged the Croatian offensive but acknowledged
that there could be some advantage in the developments.
''Maybe these circumstances, tragic as they are, will provide a new

A SCOTTISH scientist thinks that crops of coriander could replace oil
seed rape, and bring relief to the thousands who suffer summer misery
when the fields turn bright yellow each May.
Those same fields could turn snow-white in the summer with the flowers
of coriander. The thick pollen of the rape flower would be replaced with
a whiff of spice.
Coriander, first introduced to Britain from the Mediterranean by the
Romans, is also prized for its medicinal properties -- the seeds of the
coriander are regarded as a cure for flatulence.
Scientists say that the seeds, used commercially as an ingredient in
curries, can yield natural oils needed to make nylon and detergent and
save Britain a #120m annual imports bill for coconut oil.
Now they are working to improve the existing coriander strains by
genetic engineering.
Dr Steve Millam, of the Scottish Crop Research Institute at
Invergowrie, near Dundee, has grown Britain's first field of coriander.
He said: ''We are always looking at ways of diversifying our crops.
Most people are sick and tired of oil seed rape, and, of course, some
people are literally sick of it.
''Coriander does not give off the horrible odour that oil seed rape
does. As well as being environmentally friendly, coriander contains
valuable oils needed for industry.
''Coriander provides possiblities to diversify the agricultural
landscape and boost rural economies.
''It has the potential to take off as a crop because you can extract
oils from it. These can be split into two groups, with half used for
making nylon and half for detergent and soap powder.''
Earlier this year, doctors at Dundee University produced the first
study linking oil seed rape to respiratory diseases and asthma-like
symptoms.
Oil seed rape is grown on half-a-million acres in Britain and is worth
#233m to the farming economy.
Dr Millam's colleagues are attempting to engineer a less obnoxious
form of oil seed rape genetically, but he believes that coriander is a
suitable alternative.
He said: ''Genetically engineered oil seed rape is being developed at
the moment. But why bother? Why not grow a few more different crops?
Coriander can be grown on a field scale. It is growing in a field at
Invergowrie, although we still need to improve its oil content.''
Coriander grows wild in the South of England.
The ancient Chinese believed the seeds could confer immortality. They
are used by some distillers to flavour gin, and were once used by vets
as a drug for horses and cattle.
Coriander ''comfits'' -- seeds coated in white sugar, were once sold
by confectioners as a cure for indigestion and flatulence.

TWO legendary film stars have become in an exchange of insults to
rival the most vicious in a long tradition of thespian catfights.
Smarting from Michael Caine's description of him as a ''drunk'',
Richard Harris dipped his pen in vitriol and unleashed a torrent of
abuse at the south London star.
In a 1200-word letter printed in yesterday's Sunday Times, Harris
dismissed Caine as ''an over-fat, flatulent 62-year-old windbag'' with
''vast limitations''.
Harris's ego had been bruised by a feature in last week's Sunday Times
Magazine, promoting Caine's new film Bullet To Beijing, in which he
revives his 1960s role as spy Harry Palmer.
Caine is reported as considering himself ''a British Gene Hackman, the
star character actor with a lot to teach the younger generation''.
Comparing himself with other giants of his generation, Caine said:
''Stamp did drugs but I never did. The British actors were all drunks --
O'Toole, Harris, Burton -- but at least it takes 25 years to kill
yourself with it.''
An outraged Harris -- recipient of two Oscar nominations -- described
the comment as a tasteless insult to the memory of the late Richard
Burton.
And he scoffed at the notion of Caine taking top honours among actors
of his age or being compared to Hackman.
Harris wrote from his home in the Bahamas: ''Any suggestion that he
has eclipsed the names of Finney, O'Toole, Burton, Bates, Smith, and
Courtenay is tantamount to prophesying that Rin-Tin-Tin will be
solemnised beyond the memory of Brando.
''Hackman is an intimidating and dangerous actor. Mr Caine is about as
dangerous as Laurel or Hardy, or indeed both, and as intimidating as
Shirley Temple.
''He squeals publicly of Stamp's drug-taking. This casual disregard
for the loyalty of friendship reeks of a schoolboy squealing on the wild
boys of his class to gain teacher's affections.''
Harris did not deny enjoying the odd glass of beer but described his
drinking sessions with Burton and O'Toole as ''a voyage most great
actors embarked on where, on occasion, they might touch the Gods to
ignite their craft''.
He added: ''If Caine had indulged in a few trips to his local boozer
via a taxi, rather than breezing past the common man . . . in his fleet
of chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces . . . he might have achieved a modicum
of immortality in his career, instead of being part-owner in a series of
dreary restaurants.''
Caine did not respond yesterday to requests for his comments.

SCOTS joined people around the world yesterday in remembering the
first atomic bomb, which killed 140,000 Japanese residents of Hiroshima
on impact 50 years ago. A further 60,000 died from associated diseases.
As doves fluttered into the sky and around 100,000 people stood in
silence, the city's mayor, Takagi Hiraoka, made a surprise apology for
Japanese actions during the Second World War. He said Japan wanted to
apologise for the unbearable suffering that the Japanese colonial
domination and war had inflicted.
However, there was also a strong feeling in Japan that the United
States attacks on Hiroshima, and Nagasaki two days later, were
unjustified.
Remembrance was also tinged with anger at France's decision to resume
nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
In Glasgow's George Square, CND held a small peace vigil while
supporters joined Central Regional Council members for a memorial
service in Bridge of Allan. Leading the service, Canon Kenyon Wright
said that, 50 years on, the world faced a greater danger of nuclear
holocaust than ever before.
Earlier, the Scottish National Party MP for Perth and Kinross,
Roseanna Cunningham, condemned the French nuclear tests, adding that the
SNP was the only non-nuclear party in Scotland.
In London, Greenpeace staged an anti-nuclear testing protest by
painting white chalk shadows -- representing the vaporised victims of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- on walls and pavements outside 20 key
landmarks in the capital. Six activists were arrested.
A Greenpeace spokeswoman said the French tests signalled the
development of a new generation of nuclear bombs as well as posing an
immediate threat to the people and the environment of the South Pacific.
London also hosted a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament vigil in
Trafalgar Square and a service for peace in Westminster Abbey. A service
was also held in Coventry Cathedral, during which a sculpture, identical
to one given to Hiroshima's Peace Museum, was unveiled.

A CIVIL servant became Mastermind champion on BBC1 last night in his
''ultimate achievement''.
Mr Kevin Ashman, 35, captained the team which won BBC TV's Great
British Quiz last year. His other championships include Quiz Night in
1993, Fifteen-to-One in 1989, Sale of the Century in 1990, and Trivial
Pursuit in 1993.
In addition, he hopes to win the Radio 4's Brain of Britain title.
Mr Ashman, from Winchester, first entered Mastermind eight years ago.
In the 23rd final, recorded in Edinburgh, he answered specialist
questions on the Zulu War and scored 39 points, two short of the record
41 he notched up in the first round when he answered questions on Martin
Luther King.

THE rugby scrum of photographers around Australian songstress Kylie
Minogue threatened to produce the only casualties of day two of the T in
the Park music festival at Strathclyde Country Park, near Hamilton.
As she made her way through the hospitality tent, flanked by a phalanx
of security personnel, the enthusiasms of the gentlemen of the press to
secure the best portrait raised worries that other, less familiar
celebrities might be trampled underfoot.
It was a very real fear. Only the previous day an autograph signing
session had resulted in an injury to Kermit of the new and highly
acclaimed band Black Grape. When he took the stage shortly after 4pm on
Saturday, it was in a wheelchair, nursing a badly sprained ankle.
One of the performers at the festival was taken ill last night. The
drummer with The Shamen suffered what is believed to have been an
asthma-related attack shortly after the band began their set on the
Groove Tent stage. His place was taken by Rat Scabies, former drummer
with punk band The Damned, who was attending the festival.
The Shamen drummer was just one of many people treated by first aid
agencies during the festival. A first aid spokesperson said: ''We've had
a very busy weekend treating 970 casualties, an increase from 500 last
year. Most conditions were minor.
The resident physician on site issued a statement to revellers warning
of the dangers of the hot weather. The doctor said that there was very
limited evidence of drug abuse on the site.
Yesterday's programme, which included Minogue's appearance and
performances from The Boo Radleys, The Shamen, The Beautiful South, and
M People, attracted another capacity 30,000-strong crowd with all of the
single day tickets being sold well before Minogue took the stage.
The festival's popularity with the punters was matched by the interest
of the celebrities. Joe Strummer of The Clash, Chrissie Hynde of The
Pretenders, and Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That, were all said to
have pitched their tents to enjoy the full weekend's festivities.
Last night, a Strathclyde Police spokesman said a eight people had
been arrested over the two days of the festival, all for minor offences.
Whatever the other bands were on Saturday, it was Ayrshire's
undiscovered treasures, the Trashcan Sinatras, who won the day.
Sentenced to top the bill on the event's Siberia Stage -- a podium
tucked behind a rubbish disposal wagon and two long food-queues,
officially (and parochially) known as the Caledonia stage -- they ambled
out apologetically and were spellbinding thereafter.
Scotland's answer to REM, every Trashcans' song is invested with a
melancholy gorgeousness and with a shrug of the shoulders and a knowing
half-smile by frontman Frank Read. He even transformed Lulu's hitherto
unremarkable To Sir With Love.
The Happy Mondays' long-awaited successors, Black Grape, were
engagingly loutish and funny. Paul Weller was quite good for his age,
but went on a bit. Massive Attack's annexing of the Groove Tent went on
all day, but still smouldered.
Promoter Stuart Clumpas pronounced himself delighted with the
behaviour of the crowd. ''The response from both sides of the stage this
year has been tremendous in terms of audience turnout, and in terms of
the number of compliments about the audience's enthusiasm that we've
received from most of the 67 bands and their management.''

MORE than 300 jobs will be created in Scotland as a result of the
buy-out and conversion of 16 supermarkets by Kwik Save.
Kwik Save, Britain's largest discount food retailer, is opening 13 new
stores throughout the country, refurbishing 12 other small stores in the
North-west of England, and converting 16 of its Scottish Shoprite stores
to the Kwik Save name.
The company, which is based in North Wales, said that in Scotland a
total of 340 jobs would be created by the conversion of the 16 Shoprite
stores -- at Aberdeen (2), Dundee (2), Edinburgh (3), Glasgow, Arbroath,
Penicuik, Blairgowrie, Hamilton, Paisley, Bridge of Allan, Whitburn, and
Cambuslang.
A further 13 new store openings will create 540 jobs as part of Kwik
Save's 64 new store openings a year, and includes the development and
opening of a store at Stevenston, in Ayrshire.

<HEADLINE>Pay rises have MPs protesting</HEADLINE>

MPs are set for a 2.7% pay rise which will take their annual salary to
#34,085.
Many MPs are angry about the increase, which is less than the 3.5%
inflation rate, and one Tory member described their pay levels as
''pathetic''.
The rises mean back benchers' pay will go up by #896 from its current
#33,189 and Ministers will get a #1831 increase from #67,819 to #69,650.
Two years ago, MPs voted to link their pay awards to a deal negotiated
by middle-ranking civil servants. The Treasury has just offered these
grades 2.7% and their union has recommended acceptance.
Many MPs are furious because most civil servants whose pay is linked
to parliamentary salaries have become eligible for performance bonuses
worth up to 2% on top of their 2.7% increase.
It had been suggested that MPs might be able to get a change in the
way their pay is decided but it now seems there will be no new pay
formula.
One MP, who refused to be named, said: ''Our pay is pathetic. It makes
us out to be the laughing stock among our constituents who are in
management positions.
''They think we ought to do something about it. A sensible salary for
an MP would be between #50,000 and #75,000.''
Compared to foreign parliamentarians, MPs protest they are poorly
remunerated for their long hours.
American congressmen get the equivalent of #82,000, Italian MPs get
#76,410, Germans #74,400, and the French #54,000.
The Prime Minister's salary goes up by #2214 to #84,217 while Labour
leader Tony Blair's rises from #64,207 to #65,940. The increases come in
on January 1.
