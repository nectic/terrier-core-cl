* SCOTT Welch gained revenge -- and the British heavyweight title --
by stopping James Oyebola in the tenth round at Brighton's Metropole
Hotel last night.
Oyebola was rescued by referee Dave Parris after taking his second
count of a brawling, and often untidy fight.
But the quality of the bout meant little to Welch's home town fans who
saw their man reverse Oyebola's World Boxing Council International title
win over him in Atlantic City 18 months ago.
Welch also landed the vacant Commonwealth title into the bargain as he
he became Britain's first white heavyweight champion since David Pearce
in 1983-85.

Allan Laing talks
to James Macpherson about the return of Taggart without Mark McManus
-- and a promotion tinged with sadness
STRANGE coves, television actors. Often precious, sometimes
overbearing, usually difficult, and like as not in proud possession of a
guid conceit of themselves. A relief then to discover that James
Macpherson is none of these things. Quite the reverse, in fact. Here is
a man, a nice man, who is genuinely grateful for the success he has
achieved and who has not allowed it to go to his head.
''Go to my head?'' he asks, by way of exclamation. ''How can it go to
your head when you're in Glasgow?'' He then cites a perfect example of
how Glaswegians have the rare ability to bring you back down to earth.
Recently he was returning from a holiday in America with his wife and
three kids.
It had been a long flight, the family was fractious, and he was, well,
knackered. As they left the plane at Glasgow a wee woman turned to her
pal and said, ''Is that no him out of Taggart? Aye it is. Do you no
remember him? He was in Gregory's Girl!'' There is, I suppose, a passing
resemblance to John Gordon Sinclair.
This coming week is one of mixed emotions for Macpherson. It sees the
return of Taggart -- which pleases him -- and finds his character (DI
Jardine) in charge -- which pleases him even more. But there is a
profound sadness about it as well. It is the first Taggart without Mark
McManus, who died last year.
Throughout an hour-long conversation, McManus's name crops up again
and again. And not by me. Not once. It is Macpherson who mentions him,
each time with a genuine affection which, touchingly, borders on a
fraternal love.
When he talks of acting, he remarks that McManus taught him so much.
Again, when he discusses the pressures of fame, he explains that he
learned how to cope from the example set by Mark. And, each time the
name is mentioned, the actor smiles and his eyes soften, perhaps at a
cherished memory.
Initially, the script for the latest three-part series, which finds
Jardine and his team investigating the murder of a former pop star,
involved the Taggart character. But, with McManus ill and sadly unlikely
to recover, the piece was rewritten without his character. The pressure
mounted on Macpherson.
''He died about three weeks into the eight-week shoot. In a curious
way, it became a little easier after that. When he was really ill, every
time the telephone rang, you had to scrape me off the ceiling.
''I had no relations who had died before so I had no guidelines on how
to cope with the pressure. I'd go to bed thinking 'Is he all right
tonight or is the telephone going to ring?' The thing is that Mark was a
friend,'' he explains. And then there is a brief moment's pause. ''He is
what I call a friend,'' he says again.
Though, at the time, Macpherson did not know what would happen to the
programme if McManus was unable to return, he was aware that STV had
wisely made contingency plans.
''I knew they were definitely not going to cast anyone else in the
Taggart role. And I knew that they had made arrangements for Mark being
unwell. I had spoken to him about it as well. It is no secret that he
had been ill for a long time and his part had been written down to suit
him,'' he adds.
There is a perceptible change to Jardine's character in the new
series. No longer is he the subordinate. He is in charge; the gaffer.
And with that comes a tougher, more ruthless, attitude.
''The thing is that Jardine doesn't report to Taggart any more. He has
no figure to turn to in order to ask 'What am I doing wrong here?''' he
says.
The ''promotion'' for Macpherson clearly offers the actor far more
scope as an actor and the opportunity to flex his muscle. And flex it he
certainly does in the new series as the mild-mannered, non-drinking,
Christian copper finds himself having to assert his authority with those
who work on his team.
''I rather enjoyed that; tearing a strip off people,'' he admits. ''Of
course, I know that even in real life when a boss gives someone a row it
is only an act. They have to appear to be super confident. To be honest,
I wouldn't like to have to do it in reality because hurting people isn't
nice.
''You have to be careful with the character. I don't want him to turn
into a bastard now because that would be wrong. Mind you, he has always
been a womaniser. His problem is that he has always picked the wrong
ones every time.''
Of course, the Persil-clean whiteness of the Jardine character has
been slowly washed out over the past few years. Initially, it was
necessary in order to introduce a counterpoint to Taggart's
hard-drinking, tough-talking, role.
James Macpherson, it turns out in the course of the conversation, has
featured in The Herald before. Flashback to 1977. A Lanarkshire teenager
writes a story, published in The Herald, which highlights the problems
faced by school-leavers in the search for a career. The youngster
bemoans the fact that, though desperate to become a draughtsman, the
best he can get is the offer of an apprenticeship as a toolmaker.
Yes, it was James Macpherson. In the event, his early working life
took off in a different direction. He became a lab technician at
Glasgow's Southern General Hospital. But, at some point along his
lifeline, he decided (as we all do) that he didn't really like his job.
So, spookily enough, he decided to become a policeman.
''I remember going for an interview at Pitt Street and they were
really hard. And I came out and said 'That is not for me','' he
explains. So he asked himself what did he really want to do. He had done
some amateur drama -- and loved it -- so he said, well, that's what I
want to do. Then someone told him that there was a place in Glasgow
where they taught you how to act. Three years later he emerged, a
fully-fledged actor, from the RSAMD.
And did he walk in to Taggart? No. He walked in to the dole queue,
signing on at Maryhill DHSS. Struggling to make the breakthrough in the
acting profession, he managed to find work in a friend's engineering
firm. Indeed, for the first two years after securing the role in
Taggart, he was still working with that firm.
Macpherson says of the series: ''I like the fact that it doesn't treat
you like a numpty. It's a case of 'If you don't get it, then tough. If
you don't understand it, tough. And the great thing is that the clues
are there.''
But in the end, it is back to McManus. The actor recalls: ''You know,
he didn't say much to me at the start. I think he swore at me. But he
did it in a very funny way and he made me laugh. That is always a good
start.
''It was a relationship which grew. Eventually, it became one of those
friendships where you reach the stage where you don't even have to talk
to each other.''
* Legends, the new three-part Taggart, starts on ITV on Thursday.
Arresting performance: James Macpherson as the more ruthless Detective
Inspector Jardine, with Barbara Dickson, who also appears in the return
of Taggart on ITV this week.

PAUL WELSH tells the story of one man with a terrifying shaggy dog
tale.
IT happened on Arran, Glasgow businessman, Victor Devine tells you,
and he is not the sort to make up a story. His motorcycle showroom on
the Great Western Road has been a glittering, 1000cc success for years,
a business that relies on pragmatism and a modern way of thinking.
Talking to the man, he appears to be level-headed and not prone to
exaggeration.
Nevertheless, when Scotland's fairies, spirits and witches come out to
dance this Hallowe'en, Devine will give the ancient festival more
respect than the majority of other ''townies''.
He was on Arran, an island which is apparently home to an active witch
coven (of the white variety), and unsurprisingly, the landscape reflects
this occult background. Two local hills -- Dundhu, the Black Hill and
Dunfion, the White Hill -- are said to harbour opposing spirit forces.
''Sitting on a stile, taking in the view from Dunfion,'' he says, ''a
barn owl landed on the fence beside me -- so close, in fact, I could
touch it. I thought this was very strange because it was the middle of
the day.''
Relating this to a friend familiar with local folklore later in the
day, he was told it was probably ''a spirit trying to communicate with
him'' because the area was famous for it. Sceptical as he was, Devine
decided to return.
Historically, the best time for hooking up with spirits has always
been Hallowe'en. Records suggest early Celts celebrated Sainfuin (sain
equals summer, fuin equals end) at this time. During Sainfuin, druid
priests lit a large bonfire known as the Fire of Peace or Sham-in
(Baal's fire). That night, they tried to resolve all the personal
disputes and conflicts lingering in the community.
Around 610, the heathen pantheon was converted into a church by the
Pope, and dedicated to Christian martyrs. Originally, All Saints Day
fell on May 1 but this was changed to November 1 in 834. This is taken
to indicate that a major ''heathen'' celebration took place on the same
day, in all probability Sainfuin and Sham-in.
In the ninth century, the replacement Christian festival was known as
All Hallow, derived from a Saxon word haligan, to keep holy. Druids
believed spirits were at liberty to visit old friends and ''haunts'' on
particular days of the year, so keeping them happy was paramount. In a
further de-heathenising gesture, the church also claimed November 2 as
All Souls Day.
Reflecting their custom of day beginning in the evening, Hallowe'en
(the eve of All Hallows) is a classic ''cargo-cult'' scenario with
different belief systems intermingling and leaving a widely celebrated
hybrid today.
The Hallowe'en tapestry, however, would not be complete without
visitors from the netherworld, and many ethereal creatures were expected
on this night. The well-developed Scottish fairy folklore may also help
interested researchers determine exactly what happened to Victor Devine
that day on Arran.
Returning to the hill at dusk, Devine was intrigued by the idea of
spirits inhabiting the hill. He waited there, but the owl failed to
materialise. He started to walk back down, disappointed.
''It was getting dark,'' he remembers, ''and suddenly Sooty, my dog,
came running towards me making the most horrendous noise, as if in
terrible pain.''
As Devine stooped to examine the dog, he looked up and was confronted
by a terrifying apparition. ''A massive shape passed in front of me,''
he recalls. ''It is difficult to describe its dimensions -- it had no
depth, but was not flat. It was huge with odd-shaped patches of grey and
black. This was not a mist, it was indescribable!''
Struggling to make sense of what he saw, he was seized with fear. The
dog pulled free from him and he eventually found it whimpering in
distress by the house. He cannot explain what he saw. It could, however,
have been any number of things.
Cailleach Bheur, the Blue Hag of the Highlands, or Meg Mullach, a
hairy female brownie are two possibilities. Or perhaps the apparition
was a fridean, a member of the supernatural race that is said to live
under rocks. An offering of milk and bread would have been tactful, if
that was the case.
However, given the terrified reaction of the dog, the most likely
explanation is that Devine had a close shave with a malignant spirit of
some description. The evil fairies of Scotland are the Sluagh, or Host
of The Dead, but as Dunfion is the white hill of Arran, local residents
must hope that the tenancy has not recently changed hands.
James Napier's study of Scottish folklore published in 1879, was
written to expose and undermine ''superstitious'' beliefs exactly like
these. ''These superstitious ceremonies and beliefs in their old forms
and gross forms are fast passing away,'' e declared.
More than 100 years later, though, there is no sign of Napier but the
spirit of Hallowe'en lives on everywhere the fairies are remembered in
Scotland. Come to think of it, that includes Hillhead. Trick or treat,
Mr Devine, trick or treat?

TOUGH rules aimed at stamping out drug abuse in sport are set to be
introduced in Britain. Under the new legislation, anyone found guilty of
having an intent to supply anabolic steroids and similar drugs could
receive a maximum jail sentence of five years and an unlimited fine.
Sports minister Iain Sproat told Parliament that Home Secretary
Michael Howard intended to bring in an order ''very shortly'' to make
anabolic steroids controlled drugs under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act.
Former Olympic athlete Menzies Campbell, who speaks on sport for the
Liberal Democrats and has campaigned hard for a ban, welcomed the
Government's move.
''The misuse of anabolic steroids appears to be on the increase.
Legislation alone will not end the folly of drug abuse in sport, but it
will be an important weapon in the fight,'' said Campbell.

JONAH Lomu, the New Zealand wing, makes his first appearance in Europe
today following some extravagant pre-match publicity as the All Blacks
take on Italy in a one-off Test match in Bologna.
New Zealand, beaten finalists in this year's World Cup, kicked off a
tour of Italy and France on Wednesday with a 51-21 win over Italy A in
Catania. The build-up to today's match has focused on Lomu, the
outstanding player at the World Cup.
''Who will stop Jonah Lomu?'' has been the message of the pre-match
television advertising campaign, while some parts of the press have
dubbed him ''Cyclops'' and ''Colossus.''
New Zealand, who will take the field without injured first-choice
fly-half Andrew Mehrtens, have defeated Italy in both of their previous
encounters, winning 70-6 in the opening match of the inaugural 1987
World Cup, and 31-21 four years ago.
Lomu was diplomacy itself while visiting the Ferrari headquarters at
Maranello. ''Italy have improved a lot. It won't be easy,'' he said.
SCOTLAND'S young hopefuls can be seen in action against their New
Zealand counterparts in two matches next week.
The New Zealand Rugby News Youth XV will be playing two Scottish
under-21 teams -- at Bridgehaugh, Stirling, on Monday, and Riverside
Park, Jedburgh, two days later. Both kick-offs are at 7pm.
It will be the second time such a New Zealand team -- sponsored by the
country's weekly rugby magazine -- has toured in Scotland.
Their 1988 predecessors included Ian Jones, Mark Allen, and Stu Foster
as well as Pat Lam, who led those New Zealanders to a 25-20 win against
Scotland's under-21 international XV at Murrayfield and returns here
next month with Western Samoa's touring team.

<TEXT>
THE Professional Boxers Association have announced a four-point plan
designed to protect boxers. Under the new proposals, boxers will be
offered free membership of the organisation, medical advice on training,
and further education opportunities in preparation for employment
outside the sport.
The association also hopes to secure backing from the National Lottery
in order to finance sophisticated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain
scans.
The recommendations follow the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC)
announcement of a 12-point plan to improve the sport's medical
regulations, once more placed under the microscope after the death of
James Murray. The PBA plan is:
1, Membership of the PBA to be opened to all professional boxers at no
charge.
2, A programme of regional PBA seminars to be organised with medical
experts available to discuss ''best practice'' in training and
preparation by boxers for contests.
3, Discussions to be held with Sports Minister Ian Sproat and Shadow
Minister Tom Pendry with the aim of securing National Lottery finance
for the provision of regionally-based MRI scans to be available for
professional and amateur boxers.
4, With the assistance of the Professional Footballers Association,
the development of further education opportunities for individual boxers
as preparation for employment outside of boxing.

THIS has to be a really nifty wee steamer iron that I bought in a
catalogue shop and has saved my life on numerous occasions. I take it to
every concert all over the world and it's just fabulous. Because I go
from one gig to the other, often with hardly any time after doing the
sound check, this is perfect. For example, the other day I was in London
and got caught up in a traffic jam for two hours so I had about five
minutes to get organised. So I hung up the clothes, plugged in the
steamer, put a wee pinch of salt into it to produce the steam, steamed
the clothes and on I went.

IN celebration of six months of buoyant trading since it opened its
Glasgow showroom, Hestia Fireside Design, at 96 Great Western Road, is
throwing its doors open this weekend and inviting those who visit the
shop on Saturday or Sunday to enjoy a glass of bubbly, and have a browse
among the profusion of distinctive fireplaces on display.
Despite the long, hot summer, proprietor Colin Greig -- who has two
other showrooms in Edinburgh -- says he is well pleased with the
business achieved in the West. ''What we've found is that people are
tending to buy the more expensive designs rather than the cheaper ones,
that's common throughout our branches. People are very home-aware these
days, and many are trying to put houses back to looking the way they
would have been when they were first built.''
Hestia designs and makes fireplaces to order. This can mean that you
buy one of their many designs, often inspired by those of the past
century, or you can have a favourite design of your own copied for you
by their craftsmen. Sometimes, someone will have particularly liked a
fireplace in a previous house, and if there is a photograph it can be
copied. Hestia tries to guarantee fitting within three weeks of
ordering, and installation usually takes one to two days.
This custom designing continues through to dimensions too, fireplaces
being created in just the right proportions to look good in the settings
for which they are destined. Natural timbers are used, mahogany,
American oak and fine pine.
Marbles -- many in most unusual colours -- are imported too, from
quarries in Portugal. We try to carry colours which other people don't
have,'' explained Mr Greig. ''This bright terracotta is one nobody else
really does and this sea fossil one -- it's easy to see why it's called
that with the patterning -- is quite different.''
Probably one of the top-selling design in Glasgow has proved to be the
Lowson mantel, a truly handsome creation in carved oak with an optional
matching over-mantel mirror. With its straight geometric lines, which
include fluted squared columns, egg and dart moulding and the softening
enhancement of carved oak leaves and flowers, this is a centrepiece
which will give instant impact to a room. Like all Hestia's fireplaces,
it can be made to measure, the fine mirror echoing all the details, and
completing an outstanding focal point.
The superb oak -- 60% of Hestia's customers buying a mantel choose it
-- adds its own distinction with the character of the graining of the
wood. Oak, of course, lends itself perfectly to the soft tones of green
slate in Lowson; the two marry happily. Slate remains a firm favourite
with many people, while marble is also immensely popular.
Gas living flame fires are what most people opt for these days at
Hestia showrooms ''The radiant ones are the most popular because they
look most realistic. People have central heating and they are seeking
mainly a focal point, obviously a gas fire inside the baby brick is more
realistic looking than a box with a convector on it, although these are
the most efficient.
''Radiant fires give a not bad heat these days, and don't run away
with the gas as they used to,'' Mr Greig says.
When it comes to fire insets, it's a case again, of paying your money
and taking your choice from a large and interesting selection. Some will
choose the plainer lines of slate or marble, others will plump for
ornate brass mouldings or cast iron emblazoned with patterns from the
past. Appropriate tiling is available in an enormous variety.
The safest route is to buy one of the ready-made designs in the
showroom, where you can see just how it all looks together. Hestia also
carries a range of enhancing accessories from companion sets to coal
buckets and ornaments.
When it comes to the worst part -- paying -- the company offers six
months interest-free credit on orders up to #1500 with a deposit of 20%.

INSURERS yesterday rejected a #3m compensation claim from 200 Shetland
islanders who say their asbestos roofs were ruined by wind-blown oil
from the Braer tanker wreck almost three years ago.
The move makes it likely that remaining claims totalling more than
#15m will end up in court.
The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, which has already
paid out more than #46m for Europe's most expensive tanker disaster,
said there was ''no evidence'' that oil from the Braer made asbestos
sheets and slates crack and curl.

FEWER than half the Royal Navy's most modern surface warships could be
risked in action against a serious enemy because the vessels' original
command and control system cannot cope with more than one threat at a
time.
As a result, the Navy has had to send two ageing frigates built in the
late 1970s to carry out frontline missions in the Adriatic and the
Persian Gulf.
The flotilla of 10 Yarrow-designed Type 23 frigates is now being
fitted gradually with a new weapons' co-ordination system costing #300m
after the original computer software had to be abandoned. But so far
only four are considered combat ready.
The other six of the #140m warships, equipped with a powerful mix of
Harpoon anti-ship missiles, vertically-launched Seawolf anti-aircraft
missiles and a rapid-fire 4.5in automatic main gun, have little or no
real protection against multiple threats from sea-skimming missiles,
aircraft and submarines.
Their predecessor Type 22 frigates HMS Brilliant and HMS Brazen
already have been sold to Brazil and are due to be handed over next
August after being decommissioned from the RN and given rapid
''showroom'' refits.
Brilliant, which starred in a fly-on-the-wall television documentary
earlier this year, is now en route for the Persian Gulf to help enforce
the UN embargo on Iraq. Brazen is on a similar deployment to prevent
arms' smuggling to the combatants in Bosnia.
The Type 23s, designed on the Clyde, were supposed to be able to
tackle air, surface and sub-surface threats simultaneously. But the
Ferranti control system chosen in the 1980s for their computer was
unable to link weapons, sensors, decoys and human decision-makers with
the millisecond-level speed needed in a modern naval battle.
It led to the ships, known as the Duke Class, being affectionately
nicknamed the ''Bruno Battleships''. Like the famous boxer, they were
said to pack a formidable punch while lacking Mensa-style brainpower.
A senior defence source said last night: ''The ships are still capable
of using all of their weapons individually. But the speed of reaction
would inevitably be slowed down and nobody is really willing to take the
risk of losing an expensive piece of hardware like a Type 23 to test the
theory.
''In effect, until they have been retro-fitted with a command system
which allows them to use the full potential of their technology to
identify, track and assess the threat-value of incoming aircraft or
missiles and deal with them in order of priority, they are too valuable
to put into harm's way.''
Work on installing the new system is being carried out on a rolling
programme at Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth, as each ship of the class
comes in for a docking and essential defects overhaul, in effect a swift
garage service.
The major problem for the RN is that it has only 35 destroyers and
frigates in the surface fleet. Seven of those are currently on
operational deployment in the Gulf, the Adriatic, the South Atlantic and
the West Indies. Four others are in port for major refits.
Many of the remaining 24 are receiving routine, though less serious,
maintenance, while others are involved in training exercises, or are
carrying out less hazardous patrol duties around the UK. By comparison,
Japan has 60 surface warships.

FRENCH international keeper Gilles Rousset last night joined Hearts on
a short-term contract, and if a few loose ends can be tied up this
morning, the 6ft 5in keeper will make his debut against Falkirk at
Brockville.
A day of negotiations ended around six o'clock when Jim Jefferies
emerged from talks with 32-year-old Rousset and his agent to confirm a
deal had been done. ''It is only short term at the moment, but we'll
have further discussions in the next couple of weeks about something
more permanent,'' said Jefferies.
''He's looked good in training and the negotiations have been lengthy,
but I'm glad something has been sorted out.''
Rousset arrives at Tynecastle with an impressive pedigree. He has had
spells with Sochaux, Lyon, Marseille, and Rennes, and as well as two
appearances for France at full international side, he was also capped
eight times as an Under-21.
Meanwhile, Jefferies returns to Brockville this afternoon with the
wanted posters still out for him in Falkirk. But the Hearts manager
better get used to being the man everyone loves to hate, because it
might not be too long before he is as unpopular at Tynecastle as he is
at his old stomping ground.
After his messy divorce from the Bairns, Jefferies' arrival at Hearts
was greeted as a marriage made in heaven, but with a quarter of the
season gone, the honeymoon is now over.
''When I came in, everybody got a lift, and if it had continued like
that this job would have been easy,'' says Jefferies. ''It's up to me to
make the environment at the club good enough for the players to produce
their best and if they don't do it, there has to be changes.
''It's not my reputation which is on the line. People can surely see
that in the past three or four years there have been some really good
managers at this club. I've told the players I have nothing to lose,
they are the ones who have been struggling over the past couple of
years.
''If these boys aren't doing it and I bring in another set who don't
do it either, I've lost nothing,'' warned the Hearts manager. ''The door
has been left open for them to show they want to be a part of what I'm
trying to achieve here.
''The players knew what kind of manager they were getting and that I
wasn't coming in to make Tynecastle a place of fear. But at the same
time, nobody is going to muck me about. The most important thing is
Hearts, not me or any individual. If certain things have to be done,
I'll have no hang-ups about doing them.
''I have no regrets about taking the job, and what has lifted me more
than anything has been the response of the fans. We haven't had a great
time, but give them something to shout about and you see a response.
Give them success and God knows what could be achieved at Tynecastle.''
Falkirk could also have a ''new'' keeper today as Tony Parks is fit
again after his hamstring injury. Parks had hoped to play in a reserve
match on Thursday night, but that match was postponed because of the
weather, so now John Lambie has to decide whether to gamble on the
Englishman or stick by Billy Lamont, who kept a clean sheet at
Kirkcaldy. John Clark could also play, but Derek Ferguson remains
doubtful.

EVEN among jazz fans, the name Lee Wiley is rarely heard. One of the
most influential singers of the century, she remains -- to many people
-- little more than a name. Anyone who has heard any of her recordings,
however, is unlikely to forget them: her voice is one which raises the
spirits. Among her admirers were Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong and
Marlene Dietrich; the singers she influenced include Peggy Lee, and she
regularly inspired critics to ecstatic, and near poetic, musings on her
interpretations of the popular songs of her day.
A film based loosely on her life was made in 1963. It was called
Something About Lee Wiley -- a title which hints at the elusive quality
of the Wiley voice. You could describe it -- as others have -- as warm,
sensual, fragile, husky, pure and unpretentious. But there's still
something else; something that's difficult to pin down. It could be the
way she had of implying a note amidst her breathiness; or of leaving a
wisp of a note hanging in the air, lingering in the mind of her
listener. Whatever it was she did, it was utterly unique and enhanced
every tune she caressed with her velvety vocals.
Lee Wiley was born eighty years ago this month -- on October 9, 1915
-- in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma -- a town she described with characteristic
irony as ''about as small as a town can get''. Legend has it that she
was of Cherokee Indian, Scottish and English ancestry; and musicians
later nicknamed her Pocahontas or The Indian Princess. She certainly
comes across as having been as sophisticated and elegant in appearance
as her tasteful vocal style suggests.
Wiley was listening to the blues from an early age, and longed to be a
singer. ''I had a boyfriend who would skip school with me and we would
go over to the local store and play records ... they called them 'race
records' and they only sold them in a certain part of town -- the
coloured part,'' she told one interviewer. Her favourite black singer
was Ethel Waters: ''I loved to hear her and I adapted her style and
softened it to make it more ladylike''.
In her mid teens, Wiley left Oklahoma to sing with Leo Reisman's band
in New York; working with him and the popular Paul Whiteman outfit on
radio, and graduating quickly to her own radio show -- The Pond's Cold
Cream Hour Starring Lee Wiley. Along the way, she suffered a couple of
setbacks: suspected tuberculosis, which forced her to take a year off
work, and later temporary blindness and disfigurement, the result of a
fall from a horse -- just as she was about to do a screen test in
Hollywood.
When Wiley emerged from that catastrophe she emerged as a fledgling
jazz singer: whereas previously, she had been singing with commercial
bands for the mass audience of radio, it was the jazz fraternity which
now took her under its wing, and provided the perfect musical settings
for her intimate and swinging vocal style. In 1939, backed by the likes
of Max Kaminsky (trumpet), Fats Waller (piano and organ), Eddie Condon
(guitar) and Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Wiley recorded what has become a
classic: a collection of George and Ira Gerswhin numbers -- many of them
(though it's hard to believe now) rescued from obscurity. Not only did
Wiley set a trend by recording the first songbook album, she also scored
a winner by transforming songs which were familiar only as showtunes
into sensitive, and dramatic, jazz standards.
The album was recorded for Liberty, a high-class music shop with an
elite clientele, and they (not to mention the messrs Gershwin) were so
delighted with it, that it was quickly succeeded by a Cole Porter
equivalent. Porter was so taken with it, that he was prompted to write:
''I can't tell you how much I like the way she sings these songs. The
combination of voice and musical accompaniment is excellent. Please give
my congratulations to Lee Wiley''. Songbook albums of Rodgers and Hart,
Harold Arlen and Irving Berlin followed, and -- with her respect for the
verse and the meaning of the lyrics -- hers have become the definitive
versions of many of the songs she recorded.
Wiley was, as her friends have noted, a complex person. One defining
characteristic, evident in her music, is her honesty and sense of
conviction: she once walked out on a radio show because the producers
refused to give composer/arranger/conductor Victor Young (her first
major love, with whom she she wrote her hit Anytime, Anyday, Anywhere)
any credit for his work. She was a free spirit, and seems to have been
able to blend into any social circle. Her friend Larry Carr said: ''She
loved the free-wheeling, barrel-house atmosphere of jazz clubs and
musicians but there was also another, equally strong, side of her that
appreciated the well-bred, genteel and chic side of society''. Just as
Katharine Hepburn once said of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers that he
lent her class and she lent him sex appeal, the same applies to Wiley
and jazz. She brought sophistication to the music and it brought out the
sexy side of her. It was the perfect relationship.
From 1943 until 1948 Wiley was married to the pianist Jess Stacy, and
sang with his short-lived big band and Eddie Condon's group. By the late
1940s, she was working on the nightclub circuit and beginning her slide
into obscurity. Her sumptuous 1950 Columbia album, A Night In Manhattan,
won acclaim and led to more recordings in the mid 1950s after which she
only made the rare appearance on television and radio. The TV film
Something About Lee Wiley (starring Piper Laurie) caused a resurgence of
interest in her music, but she didn't record again until 1971. The
superb Back Home Again proved to be her last album. She died in December
1975 after a long battle against cancer.
The great tragedy of Lee Wiley is that her legacy of recordings is
pretty slight, and she doesn't appear to exist on film. She was, by all
accounts, too happy-go-lucky to be ambitious and too dismissive of
commercial work, and that could be why, during her lifetime at least,
she was never acknowledged as a singer on a par with Billie Holiday or
Ella Fitzgerald. Or maybe she was: at her last public appearance, in
1972 at the Newport Jazz Festival, audiences went wild for her -- a
characteristically happy note on which to end her career.

In the first of a new series, Clare Henry talks to the artist who
arrived with a charming teacup, but now offers more disturbing images.
IN April 1987 Alison Watt made a spur of the moment decision that led
straight to fame and fortune. Halfway through a self-portrait she
included a teacup -- perched right on top of her head. The picture won
London's #10,000 National Portrait Award and Watt, still a final year
student at Glasgow School of Art, was commissioned to paint the Queen
Mother.
So does she still have the teacup? Her light and airy studio at the
top of a West End tenament is certainly full of objects familiar from
her pictures: white ceramics, (including the cup!), enamel bowls;
bunches of dried roses, the white drapes and subtlestriped ticking that
her nude models pose on, lots of white plaster casts (her favourite is a
Greek horse's head) -- and even Peckham's flower pot loaf that made the
front cover of her first solo London show in 1990. ''It's lasted well.
They don't make them any more.''
These still life objects jostle for space among numerous pictures by
her contemporaries, (she is an excellent and loyal patron) plus pictures
by heroes like Crosbie and Byrne. Then there's the inspirational
postcards collected since student days, a mix of classical and naif
images with Leonardo, Ingres and Freud pinned alongside eighteenth
century pigs and quaint peasants. Her favourite, a woman's head by
Degas, was originally torn from a magazine.
Ingres has influenced her most as a painter, she says. She discovered
him on a trip to Paris in 1989 where she stayed in a hotel opposite a
horse butchers. ''Ingres has been given a bad press -- but he's really a
modernist -- way ahead of his time.''
And Ingres's famous picture La Source, much reproduced in Victorian
and Edwardian times, is what sparked off Watt's most recent triptych
which goes on display in October as part of her major London exhibition.
She's worked flat out for this show for two years. During this time
her paintings have gradually changed, moving from straightforward life
studies via allegorical nudes to broadly conceptual studies of parts of
the body.
Her new work is more pared down, less busy. ''I've become more
selective. At the start I had too many ideas. I tried to pack them all
in. Now I've a clearer idea of what I'm doing.''
Body Parts, The Source and its predecessor, Anatomy Triptych, have a
key autobiographical element. In 1993 Watt, who suffered from ME as a
student, became ill again and was told there was something seriously
wrong with her heart. In Harley Street she underwent months of gruesome,
painful tests before the medics decided it was a wrong diagnosis.
''Gradually what I endured became a wider issue; more universal. Viewers
don't have to know anything about me to be able to identify with the
imagery.''
Her new paintings reflect this period of being cut and scored, hurt
and holed. ''I became obsessed with the body and especially the torso
and pelvic area. I had to be conscious while they were putting tubes
into me and giving my heart electric shocks, and the medication to dull
the pain made me feel as though I was floating and watching myself.''
To transcribe this she first used diagrams of the ribcage -- then the
gutted carcass of a pig. ''Porcine flesh is remarkably similar to human
flesh. It's quite shocking how close it is in tone and feel. Evidently
human buttocks taste much like pork too.''
She works slowly and meticulously, so had one pig in the studio all
June. ''The smell was unbearable. After three days I had to wear a
mask.'' The second pig, for part two of the Triptych, was painted last
winter. ''It was cold, I kept the window open so it lasted well. But I
had to wear ten jumpers, a hat, a mask and gloves.'' Folk sure suffer
for their art.
Four small pastel sketches are pinned to the wall. She rarely draws.
''I don't map it all out. I'd get bored. I start with the eyes and work
outward. Only four sketches for 50 paintings. Not bad.''
The first big oil she did after her clinical investigations won the
Lord Provost's Prize in 1993. Her father encouraged her to submit it.
''I began with a life model to get my hand back in after a gap of six
months. I carried on working intensively with a model until mid 1994
when I started Anatomy Triptych. Everything took off. The ideas
developed faster than I could paint. But a life model was essential for
what came later. You need to know about anatomy before you can distort
or emphasise it.''
Anatomy Triptych contains three female figures and a pig suspended
from a hook over a white enamel bowl. ''I was going to paint dripping
blood, but decided it's unnecessary. Your mind fills that in.'' A second
pig lies inert under the central image of a bandaged body lying on
pastel green floral fabric. It speaks volumes about any patient's
vulnerability at the hand's of a surgeon's knife, and also of the basic
facts and fears we all try to subdue in the face of illness.
''Men are uncomfortable with the picture, not because of the pig, but
because the woman's pubic area is explicitly exposed. La Source is
different. The pubic area is shaved and sealed. It used to be
unacceptable to show pubic hair. Now its the other way round. Perhaps
it's to do with male sexual fantasy surrounding pre-pubescent girls?''
Body Parts, her latest work, involves 16 small 10x8 panels arranged as
a block. Some are male, some female, some erogenous. With others a
sexual abiguity hovers in the air. ''Occasional panels are so abstract
you can't tell which sex they are! I'd already started to section the
body in my mind by accentuating the pelvis in La Source, so Body Parts
is a logical development. Yes, some bits are mine.''
Ornamental anatomy also features around the studio in the form of a
stuffed alligator, a puffin, a pheasant, ''I'm waiting for a goose. I
want to do a really strong picture of Leda and the Swan. There's a Leda
white marble relief in Spain. It's the only image showing real rape.''
While Watt's models are usually nude, if clothes are worn, ''I like my
sitters to wear white. It helps the flesh tones''.
Unlike almost anyone I've ever known, Watt remains immaculate when she
paints. No mess. No splashes or drips -- definitely no overalls. A
poised beauty, and despite her recent illness, the epitome of health and
a million times prettier than her self-portraits, she often wears white
too. With her blond hair she has an angelic look -- when not merrily,
impishly giggling. She likes hair tidy and, with sitters, preferably
short. She's keen to finish a waist length nude portrait of Peter
Howson, as his hair is currently cut. The Portrait Gallery wanted her to
paint Evelyn Glennie -- ''Impossible! She has long locks.''
Her studio is white too, light and full of pale tones. Even the
models' chaise longue retains its faded original upholstery. She's
always liked things pale. ''I worked in pale hues even at school. I like
the challenge of painting something white. You don't choose your
palette, it's instinctive, like the clothes you wear.''
Minimal white bowls, clothes, studio. Simple eliptical shapes.
Ambiguous body parts in a minimal setting. Could Watt be the first
figurative painter to make the leap to figurative conceptualism? I think
she could.
Always one to defy the picture plane, her pictures have long played
with the rules of perspective. ''I consciously use devices to create a
very shallow picture space. There's no way a figure could stand in the
space in La Source. Now I'm bending the rules just that bit more;
turning them on their head, so to speak.'' Just like the teacup, I
mused.
A cheery personality coupled with a steely determination makes for a
powerful combination. Watt's London show is bound to produce strong
reactions. This Glasgow girl would not have it any other way.
* Alison Watt's London show runs until early November.

Don't panic. The injunction reverberates loudly through the mind of
Dominic Ryan as he takes up scuba diving.
I'M in the Firth of Clyde. Not on it. In it. The world is plankton
green. My depth gauge reads seven metres and when I look up the sky is
dancing and the light seems far away.
A pulsating translucent white football, a jellyfish I presume, floats
as if intentionally towards my left side.
Now the world is alive with bubble sounds, strange clunks, the slow
swish of the waves far above, and half-imagined shadows move on the edge
of my face mask.
Oh, and there's a man opposite me, calmly gesticulating that I should
let the sea flood into my mask. What? Let the water in?
My instructor, the unflappable George, signals an O shape with his
finger and thumb. Am I okay? Yes, I signal back, I'm fine. It's only my
brain which is dissolving into panic.
Right, I tell myself, I have a choice. I can run this like a gauntlet,
almost paralysed by my nerves, or I can try to relax, accept que sera. I
remember the rule: there is no room for panic in Scuba diving. This is,
after all, a very methodical business.
My PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Open Water
Diving Course has been in five modules, complete with lessons in the
classroom and swimming pool, videos, assessment tests, and, initially,
an awful lot of spluttering and coughing.
The first confined water session seemed more like make-believe to me.
Five of us, all novices, were fully kitted-out and shuffled into line
beside the swimming pool, checking all the fiddly bits on each other's
Scuba equipment.
The sheer weight of all that plumbing on my back threatened to topple
me into the water at any moment, and I for one was feeling slightly
ridiculous. To make matters worse, I had referred to my fins as
''flippers'' -- apparently I wasn't being a very cool frogman. But, at
long last, we were allowed to get into the water.
How such eager confidence can sink so quickly. Even 14ft can seem a
long way down. The trick is to remember to breathe. That seems obvious
enough until you're kneeling at the bottom of a swimming pool where,
believe me, it's so much more tempting to commit the number one cardinal
sin: Thou Shall Not Hold Thy Breath.
Trapping air in your lungs is definitely not recommended. My 272-page
manual states that, when heading back to the surface, expanding air can
cause overpressurization in the lungs. My instructor gives a more
graphic warning by describing my innards exploding against my ribs like
eggs in a microwave.
I override impulse and suck in tentatively through the first stage
regulator (already the technical jargon makes me feel professional).
Air! It works.
Just when everything is feeling good, the real fun begins. Taking my
regulator out and ''losing it'' didn't strike me as a particularly great
idea. However, I was told it would teach me not to panic if the worst
happened on a dive. My teeth were clamped so tightly around the
mouthpiece I thought they'd have to come out with it. There followed a
nerve-wracking moment as I blew bubbles and then I had recovered the
equipment from behind my back and was breathing, as promised, with new
confidence and not a small sigh of relief.
Such underwater antics can be quite challenging but my instructors,
Cameron and George, seemed to have unfathomable patience to endure all
my floundering.
One comforting aspect of the course is that learners are able to
perform the skills at their own pace. The next module is only tackled
when tutor and student are both happy with the progress made.
My own lessons were spread over a number of weeks, but the training
can be scheduled to fit your own timetable. When the day came for my
first open water dive, it was a point long and eagerly awaited, even if
I wasn't entirely convinced I was ready.
It's difficult not to think about the dangers of the sea, real and
imagined. It was only days before my sea dive that I heard the tale of
the conger eel. Cameron had been on a night dive in Loch Long with
George and two other friends when, inexplicably, he vanished.
Eleven hours passed before he was discovered semi-conscious on the
shore. An eel, startled by the torch light, had shot out from its hiding
place, trailing an old fishing line still hooked in its mouth. Cameron
was caught up in the twine and dragged along the depths.Finally, he
managed to free himself and make his ascent. A freak accident, he
shrugged when I quizzed him at his dive school in East Kilbride.
What the tabloids splashed as an encounter with a monster, Cameron
logged in his dive charts as an unfortunate entanglement with a placid
creature he would meet gladly on any dive.
It did make me wonder why so many people wish to enter what, on the
surface of it, is such an alien and potentially hostile environment. If
we've spent the best part of evolution crawling from the waves, what
strange impulse drives us to leap back in?
The day of my first sea dive would tell me why. We headed for
Portencross, half-way between Largs and Ardrossan. There were only two
students, myself and Stephanie, a young karaoke diva, about to embark on
her third sea dive.
The sea was calm with hardly a shiver and from the rocks we could see
through the clear water to the gently swaying seaweed. Already, I found
myself caught up in the rush to get in there.
But, as ever, it was safety first. Preparation and equipment checks
are paramount before entering the water -- everything must work and be
in its proper place. And finally in we go.
It was surprisingly comfortable. The thick neoprene wetsuit, so
difficult to squeeze into, retained most of my body heat and felt much
more supple in the water. The Scuba gear, heavy and cumbersome on land,
was almost forgotten in the brine.
After some shenanigans adjusting weight belts to get our buoyancy just
right, we swam out about 40 yards and, with a final five-point check,
deflated our BCDs and sank beneath the waves.
It was straight down to business. Exactly seven metres. No sooner had
we touched the bottom of the sea and I was trying desperately to
acclimatise to my surroundings, trying not to think about that jellyfish
somewhere off to my left, and George was signalling for the start of our
skill exercises.This face mask would have to be flooded.
Slowly, I break the seal along my forehead and the cold water trickles
in. It tickles my nose, quickly fills the mask, and I find myself
snorting salt water and fighting an incredible urge to break for the
surface.
I cough into my regulator, gulp in air, and, tipping my head back,
press the edge of the mask back against my forehead and blow sharply
through my nose. It works instantly, the air pushing the water out of
the bottom of the mask which becomes clear again. OK, signals George.
OK, I reply, and he shakes my gloved hand.
Only when all the exercises are successfully completed do we get to
swim around and simply take in the scenery.
The visibility is surprisingly good. I can see my jellyfish continuing
on its wobbly way about twenty yards to my right.
I feel I am gliding across green canyons, dipping into dark gorges. I
realise this the closest I have ever come to flying.
Controlling my buoyancy is now a simple matter of regulating the depth
of my breathing. What had seemed almost impossible in practising the
skills, has become an instinctive part of the enjoyment.
And that's when it hit me. This was enjoyable. It was breathtaking.
Quite literally, it seems, as George stops me and displays his air
pressure gauge. And how much do I have left? 50 bars. In my excitement,
20 minutes has passed in seconds. It's time to head back to terra firma.
Over two days I had three more sojourns off Portencross and each was
more exhilirating than the last. Now I was party to that strange,
indefinable happiness that divers share and there was a whole new world
waiting to be explored.

* BIG Interview number five -- Matthew Joffrasone (innkeeper) --
Edinburgh, October 1436.
Myths: You've just heard that the Scots Parliament will tomorrow order
that because of increasing rowdiness all public houses in Scotland will
have to close their doors by 9pm under pain of imprisonment. As
secretary of Edinburgh's Innkeepers' Association what's your initial
reaction?
Joffrasone: It's one of disbelief. Frankly, I am completely shattered.
For the past couple of years we've worked to build up our reputation for
service in the license trade and this will come as a hammer blow, an
enormous backward step. I imagine you'll be talking job losses.
Myths: The decision is being taken because of increasing drunkenness
and violence, particularly in the centre of Edinburgh. Would you dispute
the fact that the presence of a drinking establishment for every 50
citizens is an incentive to disorder?
Joffrasone: For decades visitors from abroad kept telling us we were a
backward nation -- no pavement cafes, sordid nightlife, and a jousting
team unlikely ever to make the European Super League. If you set about
trying to improve things there's always the risk that someone will
overdo the ale. Perhaps we do have a surfeit of pubs but mark my words,
there'll come a day when Edinburgh will be world-famous for its
hostelries, every day a festival.
Myths: How exactly have you improved your facilities in recent years?
Joffrasone: Simply by listening to our customers' demands. They wanted
24-hour drinking so we tried to accommodate them. The changes may seem
radical, revolutionary even, but they are customer-led. Nowadays people
insist that their tankards are wiped on the landlord's apron before
being replenished; when they spit in the sawdust they no longer expect
it to spit back; they want their ales at the correct temperature and
something more comfortable to sit on than barrels. They also object to
little things we took for granted a decade ago -- like a sow giving
birth on the tavern floor, or cattle tethered in the family department.
Myths: Some of your establishments are even providing bar food?
Jellied eels from the Nor' Loch, pork scratchings, pickled pigeon eggs.
Jofrrasone: Yes indeed, and don't forget the entertainment. Instead of
folk lying around snoring in a drunken heap as the evening progresses
you'll find them throwing the dart, although the magistrates have warned
us against using street urchins as targets, the older customers enjoy
clicking the dominoes and we have medieval Mastermind and singalong
nights with the old Scots favourites.
Myths: And can you honestly say you've done your bit for eradicate the
unruly element?
Joffrasone: You'll remember that not so long ago we were permitted to
bludgeon troublemakers to within an inch of their life. Now this is
frowned upon. However, uncouth events like seeing how high you can pee
against the bar-room wall and our famous hacking tourneys which produced
three national long-distance gobbing champions are utterly proscribed.
Yes, I can say with confidence that we've tidied up our act.
Myths: How confident are you that this proposal can be overturned?
Joffrasone: We must be hopeful. You see, most of the Privy Council are
customers of one hostelry or another. In truth, they are among the most
free-spending of our clientele.

''When I was a boy in Scotland I was fond of everything that was wild,
and all my life I've been growing fonder and fonder of wild places and
wild things.''
THIS was how John Muir chose to remember his childhood in Dunbar in
the 1840s. Between the crowded wynds of the burgh and the rolling fields
of East Lothian, there was enough wilderness to challenge his energy and
curiosity. His father had done well materially but found himself at odds
with the religion of his fellow citizens and in 1849, when Muir was 11,
he emigrated to Wisconsin.
Muir's teens were spent in a powerful brew of punishing work, growing
amazement at the riches of the natural life around the family farm, and
extraordinary mechanical inventiveness. Such a combination made many
emigre Scots rich, but it charged Muir with restlessness. His ingenuity
in wood won him a place at the University of Wisconsin. He began to
wander further afield and finally left the university to take a series
of mechanical and industrial jobs.
But Muir's experiences were already pushing him in a different
direction, one which was to lead, both in his lifetime and since, to the
most serious question asked of that economy. An accident to an eye in
1867 made up his mind.
Muir set off on his ''1000-mile walk to the Gulf''. On March 28, 1868,
he landed in San Fransisco and asked for ''the quickest way out of the
city''. Within days he had found the Sierra Nevada and, sliced from its
core by then unrecognised forces, the Yosemite valley. Muir's
exploration of the ''range of light'', as he called it, was made
possible by employment as a shepherd and a sawyer. He distilled these
first heady experiences in My First Summer in the Sierra, which he wrote
in 1911 from his diaries . . . Many people love wilderness because they
dislike their fellow humans. This was never Muir's motivation. He was
always a great communicator. By the 1870s he found himself in great
demand as a guide in the mountains, not because of his impulsive
immersion in their forces, nor because of his accurate scientific
knowledge, but because he combined these, he connected the prose and the
passion. His diaries enlarged into a series of magazine essays, where he
enraged his readers by his self-effacing approach to the landscape and
then moved on to call for conservation of the wild land, an end to the
frontier.
In 1880 he married and settled on a fruit farm outside San Francisco,
where in 10 years he made an adequate fortune. It was his wife, Louie,
who persuaded him to return to public life to campaign for a National
Park for Yosemite. He found an ally in Robert Underwood, editor of an
influential magazine in New York, and entered into a carefully
orchestrated campaign to save the wilderness from the sheep and sawmills
with which he had once worked. His social skills became political. In
1892 he founded the Sierra Club, to mobilise support for conservation
through education. His ability to use personal contacts for political
ends reached a climax with the famous night under the stars with
President Roosevelt in 1903.
In truth, Muir did not always win his arguments: Yosemite's sister
valley, Hetch Hetchy, was dammed to power the expansion of San
Francisco. He was a reluctant writer of books, preferring to argue with
himself in his journals by metaphor and counter-metaphor. But the body
of his writing in the end won popularity for his ideas and, reluctantly,
for himself.
Muir returned to Dunbar in 1893. When he died in 1914 there had
already been named after him the first of over 200 natural sites in the
USA. In 1995 his fame is more widespread than ever and his political
battles, scientific principles and personal philosophy are all working
hard again.

EIGHTEEN-year-old Jonathan Rowson of Aberdeen has become Scotland's
eighth player to gain the International Master title. Following June and
his silver-medal-winning second place in the European under-18
championship in Poland in July, Rowson registered his third qualifying
norm for the IM title with a score of 7/13 in the world under-20
championship which finished earlier this month in Halle, Germany.
Well done, Jonathan! The youngest Scottish player to become an IM,
Rowson has now set his sights on becoming Scotland's third grandmaster.
In view of his exceptional skill at the game, he has decided to postpone
taking up a place to study economics and philosophy at Oxford University
for a year. He has an excellent chance to succeed in his aim.
But Scotland's top teenage talent could do with some sponsorship to
help him. The world of professional chess is a difficult one. For every
Kasparov of this world there is a multitude of players who eke out a
living from small prizes in tournaments and other off-board activities.
Even though (I think) Rowson is unlikely to wish to devote his life to
professional chess, as a third Scottish grandmaster he would expand
interest in chess, most especially amongst young players.
If you would like to sponsor Rowson in the next 12 months, please
write to the Scottish Chess Association President, John Glendinning, 40
Criffell Road, Mount Vernon, Glasgow G32 9JB. He has some private
financial support and his next two outings, in junior international
championships Israel in November and Brazil in December, will be
financed by the SCA. Thereafter he is on his own and to get the title
faces expensive trips to events in England and continental Europe and
there are no events of the requisite strength in Scotland.
First place in the world under-20 championship went to the
Russian-born, naturalised German, Roman Slobodjan, who scored 10 points
and is already a grandmaster.

THAT heroic solo, that little gem of delicate improvisation on Sing,
Sing, Sing from pianist Jess Stacy, which was the artistic highlight of
Benny Goodman's Carnegie Hall Concert in l938, came about by accident.
Or, at the very least, because Goodman was in one of his infamous moods
and Stacy had downed four Scotch and sodas in the artists' bar before
going out to play.
That's only one of the fascinating insights from a series of CDs
currently available on the Jazz Alliance label. They have been taken
from the valuable Public Radio programmes which were hosted by the
English-born pianist, and which allowed the distinguished guests to
relax and stretch out both musically and verbally.
The veteran Stacy was a modest man who turned his back on the stardom
which could have been his after his glory days with Goodman and Bob
Crosby. He remained modest in retirement, refusing pleas from Goodman to
attend reunions and having McPartland travel out to his home in the
Hollywood hills to record him.
There is little doubt that the hostess thought the near 3000-mile
journey worthwhile but even she could not have realised beforehand how
illuminating the very private Stacy was going to be.
On that solo for example he recalls: ''I didn't expect to be asked to
play a solo on Sing, Sing, Sing at all because I hadn't soloed on the
record we made and I hadn't been featured on any of the concerts either.
But I think that Benny wasn't too happy that night so he changed things
around and on that number Benny just turned and told me to solo.
''I had had four Scotch and sodas and I was flying but it came out
fine. I used to listen to some of the impressionists, Ravel and Debussy,
and some of that was in there. In fact, if you listen real good you'll
hear a little bit of McDowell in there in that solo because I was
listening to him around then too.''
Stacy had not the slightest idea what he was going to play until given
the nod by Goodman -- and that's how jazz classics are often made!
The solo stays in the memory more than the racketty joyous drumming
from Gene Krupa which stunned Carnegia Hall that night and while so many
remember that, Stacy recalls working on the riverboats and a young man
named Bix Beiderbecke coming aboard when the boat docked at Davenport,
Iowa.
''He'd come on and he's pay the piano rather than the cornet,'' Stacy
says. ''And he would play all these harmonies which I knew existed and I
could hear in my head, but which I couldn't pay until Bix showed me. He
was 'way ahead of his time'.''
Stacy talks, too, of hearing the legendary Fate Marable on the
riverboats; of working for Al Capone and having Machine Gun Jack McGurn
as his boss at one stage. ''He was the man who organised the St
Valentine's Day Massacre,'' he chuckles. ''But the gangsters they liked
our music and they let us play what we wanted to play. I thought they
were kinda glamorous. Remember I was young then . . .''
Between the reminiscences Stacy plays some fine piano, still with that
ringing tone which was his trademark . . . Loverman and Autumn in New
York are superb examples of his playing towards the end of his life.
Despite his self-imposed retirement -- he played only rarely during the
past 20 years of his life -- his talents had diminished little.
On another of the issues a young piano player Dick Wellstood parades
his own quirky version of stride piano and, again, you feel in touch
with jazz history as Wellstood describes going, as a teenager in New
York, to listen to James P Johnson, the man who wrote The Charleston and
was Fats Waller's teacher.
Listen to his Ellington medley and you'll understand why Marian
McPartland had Wellstood on her guest list.
On other albums using the same format with Marian interviewing,
playing herself and playing along with the guests, you can hear pianists
such as Red Richards, Eubie Blake, Dave Brubeck; trumpeter Dizzy
Gillespie; bassist Milt Hinton; saxophonist Benny Carter and singers
Rosemary Clooney and Bobby Short among others.
The complete sessions will give you an intimate story of jazz in words
and music. Essential listening.

With Pleasure, Dick Sudhalter and Friends (Audiophile)
* NEWLY expanded and re-released 1981 album features cornettist (and
author of the definitive Bix Beiderbecke biography) Dick Sudhalter in
glorious 1920s mode, ably assisted by a bandful of virtuosi chums.
Sudhalter is really the star of the CD: his cornet is spritely and
joyful on From Monday On and wistfully Bixian on Blue River.
Clarinettist Bob Reitmeier and pianist/vocalist Dave Frishberg are
thoroughly entertaining on a hot Johnny Mercer novelty tune -- Jamboree
Jones. But the knockout number, Home, was only recorded when most of the
musicians had left the studio, and features the beautifully uncluttered
vocals of Daryl Sherman, the gorgeous obbligato of Sudhalter and Howard
Alden's splendid guitar accompaniment.

Legacy, Old Blind Dogs (Lochshore)
* THE Dogs' fourth album reveals a strengthening group identity,
albeit still largely founded on Ian Benzie's pleasantly lugubrious
singing and Jonny Hardie's expressive, sinewy fiddling. Once again,
trips to Lancashire and South Dakota aside, they update the songs and
tunes of the North East with grit and respect for the tradition; but
once again, the listening pleasure would be enhanced greatly by the
intervention of a conga thief.
Stage By Stage, Iain MacKintosh &amp; Brian McNeill (Greentrax)
* TWO of the Scottish folk scene's longest-established figures
continue their occasional concert partnership with a collection of songs
detailing nostalgia, lust and homily. Though neither is, strictly
speaking, a great singer, they get the message across in a forthright,
if rather dour fashion which is lightened considerably by the
multi-instrumental skill and brio of tunes such as, wait for it, The
Dallas-Domestic-Fort-Worth-Texas-High-Heel-Terminal-Two-Step.
Stories, Maura O'Connell (Hannibal)
* THE Nashville-based former De Dannan singer seizes songs by, among
others, Paul Brady, Shawn Colvin, and Mary-Chapin Carpenter, switching
easily between country ballad, smoky jazz and more muscular rock styles.
Produced by and featuring master guitarist Jerry Douglas, Stories isn't
quite the open-throated, open-hearted cracker of which O'Connell is
surely capable.

All Change, Cast (Polydor)
* GERRY MARSDEN'S cheeky, chirpy, post-industrial Scouse-beat
great-grandchildren pick up their guitars and seek to rattle the
jewellery of the pop-picking nobs sitting up in life's balcony. Will
they succeed? Yes, in the short term at least, because John Power and
his chums have a few catchy three-minute tunes in the grand old
jingle-jangle manner, performed with nasal laddishness and mop-topped
gusto. But what are these songs about? Crossing the Mersey by ferry? To
be met on the shore by newspaper taxis waiting to take Cast away? No.
Nothing so imaginative. Cast's songs are, for all their muscular
tunefulness, anodyne affairs.
Jazz In The House 2, various (Slip'n'Slide)
* JAZZ? Hmm, not sure about that. But this is a form of house music
which is possible to digest at home, not solely within the confines of a
club; which provides nourishment for the heart and soul as well as
simply moving the feet. This 12-track collection features a couple of
tracks from producer Danny Tenaglia (Daphne's Theme From Change and
Equinox by Code 718) as well as a pair from Kenny Gonzalez and Louie
Vega (Masters At Work's The Buff Dance and Kenlou's Moonshine). Ashley
Beedle is another featured big name, here leading the Black Science
Orchestra through the spacey pop-funk hinterlands of New Jersey Deep. My
personal fave is Drivetrain's pumping Acid Ensemble.
The Best of the Count Bishops, the Count Bishops (Chiswick)
* ALAS, they don't make 'em like the Count Bishops no mo'. For the
uninitiated, the Count Bishops were a pub-rockabilly combo who churned
out gutsy R&amp;B-tinged gems, stirring up the smug calm of the deadly-dull
pre-punk era, that dread time when tryceratops framptonii ruled the
earth. Some of the Count Bishops' no-nonsense songs, like the immortal
Train Train, they wrote themselves. Otherwise, they covered anything
that could be made to move faster and sound nasty: I Want Candy, I Take
What I Want, Mr Jones, Till The End Of the Day, Someone's Gonna Get
Their Head Kicked In Tonight, Route 66. Buy this collection and you too
could be impelled towards strapping on a pole, plugging it in, and
making a right rock'n'roll rumpus of your own.

Wagner, London Classical Players/Norrington (EMI)
* WHEN the period bands had comprehensively plundered baroque music
and stepped into the nineteenth century, it set the mind a-racing. Where
would they stop? The answer is: they didn't, and we've had everyone from
Schumann to Brahms on authentic instruments. Now Roger Norrington and
his gut-stringed London Classical Players have arrived at Wagner with a
disc of music drawn from each of the composer's creative periods. The
playing on historic instruments is now so sophisticated that sometimes
it's hard to tell the difference, other than in a general clarity of
texture and lightness of touch. Striking examples on this superb disc
include a rattling performance of the Mastersingers' Overture, a
wonderfully intimate Siegfried Idyll, an aching Tristan Prelude, and a
totally thrilling Rienzi Overture. A must.
Shostakovich Symphony No 4, CBSO/Rattle (EMI)
* AT LAST. Another sensational account of Shostakovich's amazing
Fourth Symphony, a work so blistering, so bizarre, and so dangerous that
the composer, already in deep trouble with Stalin in 1936, abruptly
withdrew it before its scheduled premiere. (It wasn't heard until 1961).
It opens with a series of the most terrifying orchestral shrieks ever
conceived, runs for more than an hour, and embraces everything from
brutality to burlesque humour. Until now, the essence of the work has
best been captured on disc by Neeme Jarvi and the Royal SNO. Simon
Rattle fetches an electrifying, terrifying performance from his
Birmingham orchestra that -- for addicts of the piece -- will complement
rather that compete with the RSNO version. Blockbuster.

CLERKS (rental, cert 18, B&amp;W).
* ORDINARY people . . . don't you just hate them? Scum of the earth! A
bit extreme, perhaps, but sensitive and noble types like you and Couch
Potato will occasionally have sympathised with the somewhat nihilistic
point of view espoused by car-repossession operative Harry Dean Stanton
in Alex Cox's Repo Man, a cult classic that was the Pulp Fiction of its
mid-1980s day, meaning the kind of film that fans learn by heart and
repeat at regular intervals.
If that cheerfully disgusted picture has a place in your heart, tell
it to move over and make room for Clerks, the scorching no-budget debut
of hotter-that-hot wunderkind Kevin Smith.
Dante and Randal (Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson) are two
over-educated twenty-somethings who man the counters in McJobs at the
local convenience store and the video store next door, and Clerks is
just a day in their life. They hang out, cheek the customers (''hey,
this would be a cool job if it weren't for the customers''), play
roller-hockey on the roof, talk about sex, get each other into
girlfriend trouble, and generally observe that portion of life's rich
tapestry that involves renting out weird movies and searching out the
fridge for the bottle of milk with the longest sell-by date.
Typical scene: a man asks for a packet of cigarettes in the store and
the man behind him goes into a passionate spiel -- complete with medical
photographs and a set of rubber lungs -- about the evils of smoking; by
the time he's finished, the whole shop is up in arms, throwing their
fags away and vowing never to smoke again. It's like Spartacus. Then it
turns out that he's the travelling salesman for a brand of chewing gum.
Don't, by the way, be misled by that 18 certificate: it's only there
on account of the way Dante and Randal talk, which is incredibly
foul-mouthed but oddly innocent and free of malice or viciousness. Bill
and Ted, Wayne and Garth, Jules and Vincent: look out, boys, the Clerks
are coming through.
LEGENDS OF THE FALL (rental, cert 15)
* BONANZA meets Dances With Wolves meets The Magnificent Ambersons in
Edward Zwick's commercially unsuccesful but well-worth-catching Western
family epic.
Three brothers -- Aidan Quinn (the taciturn, straight-arrow eldest
son), Henry Thomas (the open-hearted, idealistic youngest), and Brad
Pitt (you guessed it -- the moody, rebellious free spirit who hangs out
with the Native American family retainer) -- live a male-bonded,
big-country life at the foot of the Rockies around the turn of the
century with their father, world-weary ex-cavalry officer Anthony
Hopkins. Everything is more or less jake until the outside world kicks
the homestead door in, first in the shape of Henry Thomas's city-bred
gal Julia Ormond, closely followed by the First World War, in which all
three brothers serve but from which only two come back.
Add to this volatile sibling-rivalry situation the fact that the
America the boys come home to is a faster and harsher country than it
was when they marched away to war, less sympathetic to the traditional
values of the prairie, and the offstage chorus of woe, woe, and thrice
woe! becomes positively deafening. However, strong, irony-free
performances, allied to beautiful settings and a heartstring-tugging
music track, lend Legends of the Fall a tragic, elegiac quality to which
tender-hearted viewers will be happy to surrender; even when the corn is
as high as an elephant's eye.
THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (retail, #12.99, widescreen, cert 18).
* FETCHINGLY subtitled Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck, Roman
Polanski's 1967 vampire jape has retained a certain rosy-cheeked,
fresh-from-the-coffin state of preservation compared to other genre
spoofs of the same age -- mainly because it doesn't so much send up the
conventions of the genre as graft some good knockabout jokes on to the
bones of a genuinely scary chiller.
Taking the standard With Cross And Stake In Darkest Transylvania
scenario (as seen in 20 Hammer horrors) for his template, Polanski
handles the horror element with his customary casual brutality, a mood
enhanced by its frequent collision with broad pastiche comedy of the
kind familiar from Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein.
Jack McGowran, stars as the Dr Van Helsing-type leader of the safari,
with Polanski as his useless assistant, and Sharon Tate as the statutory
village maiden they must rescue; in hindsight, her presence in this role
adds another layer of darkness to this piece of vamp camp. One of a
kind, and just about enough at that.
BOB'S BIRTHDAY and the Best of British Animation (retail,
Connoisseur/Academy, #8.99).
* ONLY 38 minutes long, but containing more art and entertainment than
almost any two-hour feature film, this collection of six Oscar-nominated
gems (three won Oscars, too) is simply unmissable for animation buffs.
Highlights are the title film, the cartoon story of a dentist in
mid-life crisis; Nick ''The Wrong Trousers'' Park's first Oscar-winner,
Creature Comforts; and David Stoten's film-noir jape The Big Story,
featuring three Kirk Douglases, but Adam, Second Class Mail, and
Manipulation aren't far behind. Actors -- who needs them?

Moscow
DOCTORS said today that President Boris Yeltsin was keeping his
spirits up after being rushed to hospital with a mild heart attack, but
an official bulletin gave a more cautious account of the Russian
leader's condition.
''The president is dealing with his stay in hospital calmly and
showing his usual optimism,'' Tass quoted doctors at the hospital as
saying. ''He is keeping his spirits up, talking to doctors and
bodyguards, and telling jokes.''
However an official statement about the 64-year-old president's state
of health was more cautious.
''By 7.45pm there were no principal changes in Boris Yeltsin's
condition,'' the president's press office said. ''He is suffering from
an unstable blood supply to the heart but there is no heart
deficiency.''
The president's press secretary, Sergei Medvedev, told a news
conference earlier that Yeltsin, who suffered his second mild heart
attack in less than four months yesterday, will be under close medical
supervision until the end of November.
Doctors at the goverment's Central Clinical Hospital said that only
Yeltsin's wife, Naina, was allowed to visit him today, but a ban on
visits may be lifted tomorrow.
''It is likely that his first aide Viktor Ilyushin will visit the
president tomorrow,'' Tass said.
The doctors said Yeltsin had asked to read documents which were
delivered from the Kremlin today. Tass did not say whether the president
was allowed to read the papers.
''The president is showing an interest in events in the country and
around the world and specifically in reaction to his illness,'' Tass
reported.
The strong possibility that Yeltsin would have to slow the pace of his
official duties dramatically until the end of next month appeared a blow
to the strong-willed leader who has set himself an ambitious political
agenda.
Russia goes into a parliamentary election on December 17 in which
Yeltsin has set himself the task of marshalling democratic forces to
stave off a possible communist victory.
In a particular disappointment for the burly ex-communist, elected
president of the vast Russian Federation in June 1991, a Bosnian peace
summit in Moscow set for Tuesday was cancelled.
The Moscow meeting of the leaders of Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia, for
which he clinched vital US support at a summit with US President Bill
Clinton earlier this week, had been a minor foreign policy triumph,
offering a chance for Russia to reassert its role in Balkan diplomacy.
A trip to China set for next month has already been cancelled and a
planned visit to Norway in November now appears distinctly unlikely.
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 57-year-old premier who would automatically
take over if Yeltsin died or was incapacitated, projected a
business-as-usual air attending an economic forum.
Asked by reporters how Yeltsin was, he replied: ''He is OK, he is OK,
he is OK.'' He said Yeltsin would have to stay in hospital for a week.
Yeltsin's renewed ill health was certain to revive doubts over how
long he can continue to rule the country.
As well as introducing a wild card onto the seething political scene
before the December election to the State Duma (lower house), it
suggested Yeltsin's chances of running again for the presidency next
June are now remote.
Officials maintained today that he was still in full control of the
Kremlin helm. Medvedev told reporters Yeltsin had the ''nuclear button''
-- the computer which gives Yeltsin control over Russia's nuclear
arsenal -- with him in hospital.
There was no question of a transfer of power to anybody else, Medvedev
said.
* Russian and US negotiators announced a breakthrough tonight with the
formation of a joint unit of thousands of Russian and American troops to
support any peace deal in Bosnia.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and US Defence Secretary Wiliam
Perry said the unit would include several thousand engineering and
transport troops from each country, but they will not be part of the
Nato force being set up to enforce a peace agreement.--Reuter.

Michael Fry awaits a crucial moment in the campaign.
EDINBURGH, October 28 -- Decision is imminent on a Jacobite invasion
of England. Prince Charles Edward Stuart's council is to meet at
Holyrood in two days' time. If it supports him in his wish to strike
southwards as soon as possible, his army may be on the march by the end
of the week.
But the outcome of the council is by no means a foregone conclusion,
given the deep divisions among the Jacobite leaders. According to one
member of it, ''there is one-third of the council whose principles were
that kings and princes can never either act or think wrong, so in
consequence they always confirm whatever the prince says. The other
two-thirds, who think that kings and princes are sometimes like other
men and are not altogether infallible, and that this prince is no more
so than others, beg leave to differ from him, when they can give
sufficient reasons for their difference of opinion.''
The division corresponds broadly to that between the mainly Irish
advisers, whom the prince brought with him, and the Scots who have
joined him since. The latter are especially critical of his closest
aide, Sir Thomas Sheridan, described as ''altogether ignorant of the
ways and customs in Great Britain, and much for the doctrine of absolute
monarchy''. Another complaint is that ''the prince cannot bear to hear
anybody differ in sentiment from him, and takes a dislike to everybody
that does''.
Personal differences in the council are reflected in disputes about
what to do next. The prince hopes to force the pace of the rebellion,
and capitalise on its early successes. But he has run into mounting
resistance from the Highland chiefs, who would rather consolidate the
position in Scotland first.
Sources at Holyrood say Charles has now grown so impatient that he is
ready for a showdown with the chieftains. He has never made a secret of
his aim to reconquer not only Scotland but the whole of the British
Isles for the Stuart dynasty. By his decree last week which in effect
dissolved the Union of 1707, he has done what his Scottish supporters
want. Now it is for them, he says, to back his invasion plans.
The military situation anyway makes it unlikely that things can go on
as they are. It has been hard for Charles to keep his army together
because the clansmen tend to disperse with their booty as soon as they
capture any. Disciplinary problems have increased with their boredom at
waiting around in Edinburgh since the Battle of Prestonpans more than a
month ago.
They are generally well-behaved, and all complaints about them are
investigated. That has not stopped incidents like one last week when the
house at Bruntsfield Links of David Kinloch, a prominent solicitor, was
looted by a gang of Highlanders, including two women. Even officers have
complained of arrears in their pay, and the prince has had to negotiate
personally with some of them. He said after one meeting: ''Good God!
what a slavery to have to do with these fellows!''
Given his lack of resources, the 5000 infantry plus 500 cavalry which
the prince now has may be as many as he is going to get. Despite the
enthusiasm for him shown by some of the people of Edinburgh, he has not
been able to raise a regiment in the city. Even in areas of the
Highlands loyal to him, the recruitment drive has been faltering. In
Perthshire and in the Great Glen, chiefs such as the Duke of Atholl and
Donald Cameron of Lochiel have had to threaten to burn out tenants
reluctant to leave their farms and join up.
The promised help from France may also be too slow in coming. An
ambassador of enough standing to put pressure on the French Government,
Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, was dispatched to Paris only last week.
Ships from Dunkirk have already arrived at Aberdeen and Montrose, but
carrying munitions and stores rather than volunteers. At least some of
the Jacobites' difficulties with supplies have been eased by securing a
safe route from the north, a ferry over the River Forth at Alloa, with
protection from batteries on each side to stop interception by the ships
of the Royal Navy controlling the Firth.
The Jacobites remain very short of money, despite attempts to raise
taxes from the burghs they occupy. The taxes are often paid in Scottish
banknotes, but these must be turned into gold before they will be of any
use in buying supplies in England or from abroad. Though all the banks
have been closed since the occupation of Edinburgh, the Royal Bank of
Scotland has been exchanging gold for notes from the Jacobite
authorities.
Till such problems are solved, many of the Highland chiefs remain
reluctant to leave. Several also have a nationalist motive. One
commented: ''We have taken arms and risked our fortune and lives to set
him on the throne of Scotland, but we wish to have nothing to do with
England.'' To other Scots in his council, Charles seems ''preoccupied
only with England''. It is galling that ''he seems little flattered with
the idea of possessing a kingdom to which, however, the family of Stuart
owes its origin and its royalty''.
Yet it seems likely that, when the time to decide comes, the
chieftains will agree to an invasion of England. At any rate, the
Government in London appears to be assuming this will happen. A force of
5000 under General George Wade is marching up the east coast, and today
reached Doncaster. The Duke of Cumberland has just arrived from Flanders
to take command of an army which will cover the western side of England.
* Another dispatch next week.

LENNOX Lewis yeterday won a temporary High Court order preventing the
World Boxing Council from sanctioning a heavyweight title bout between
Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson. Mr Justice Evans-Lombe ordered that Lewis'
injunction against the WBC should stand until the full hearing on
November 2.
A year ago the WBC ordered Lewis to fight Lionel Butler in a final
eliminator and also decreed that Tyson would move back to the No.1
position after his first warm-up fight, although they took that step
ahead of schedule. Lewis beat Butler in the eliminator which, his
handlers claimed, should give him a direct route to the title. Bruno's
promoter, Frank Warren, plans to fight the injunction.

THE battle in the second round of the Volvo Masters at Valderrama
yesterday was won by Sweden's Anders Forsbrand. His score of 70 gave him
a total of 138, four under par and two strokes ahead of Germany's
Alexander Cejka, whose 66 not only was the lowest score so far but the
best indicator of more accommodating weather.
However, the war over the European order of merit title continued
unabated, as the three contenders were covered by only two strokes.
After the first round, Colin Montgomerie, the merit title winner for the
past two seasons, led by two from Sam Torrance and three from Bernhard
Langer; after the second, the order of precedence was Langer, after a
68, by one over Montgomerie and two over Torrance.
In monetary terms Torrance is the table leader by a narrow margin from
Montgomerie, with Langer the distant tail-gunner in the dogfight.
Although as usual the 6819-yard course dispensed its favours frugally,
with a slackening of the breeze scoring also dropped and the contest
tightened. Whereas on Thursday only seven players were on par or better
and two under 70, yesterday the respective figures were 20 and 5.
Given the treacherous nature of the course Torrance believes that two
68s could capture the tournament for him and, indeed, when he was
walking up the eleventh fairway he remarked to his caddie, Malcolm
Mason: ''The only thing we haven't been thinking about is winning this.
Of course, then I had two bogeys.''
These came at the fourteenth and short fifteenth, where Torrance took
three from the edge of each green, as he again did at the seventeenth to
make only par. His 38 home thus took some of the shine off an outward 33
in which his short game held his score together until he made three
birdies in the last four holes, interrupted by three putts at the
seventh for a bogey.
The gains at the short sixth and eighth, with shots to 12 feet and one
foot, were conventional in comparison with that at the ninth, the
course's hardest two-shotter. The distance from where he was, at the
front of the green, to the hole at the back was some 75 feet, but his
long-handled putter was up to the task.
Montgomerie felt that he had missed a chance to advance his cause
further because ''that was as easy as this course will play, and 72 was
not great.'' But much can happen over the final two rounds. As
Montgomerie, who could coax only two birdies out of the course -- from a
pitch dead at the second and a No.3-iron hit high for 230 yards from an
uphill lie to hold the seventeenth green -- noted: ''I was three ahead
of Langer at the start, yet after only nine holes he was three in
front.''
Langer had mixed feelings about his 68, having been five under for 11
holes and hoping for better still, if not to equal his breathtaking 62
in the second round last year when he won the tournament.
Accurate short-iron play followed by firm holing out endowed him with
an outward 31, four under, but he bogeyed the short twelfth and tangled
twice with trees at the last, costing him another shot.
For the third time in only two years on the European tour Cejka played
nine holes in 29, including a bogey at the short fourth, on this
occasion out in six under.
Apart from five birdies the 24-year-old German, a former Czech
national, made a marvellous eagle 3 at the 535-yard fourth with a
240-yard No.3 wood shot to the green raised above a waterfall 20 feet
from the hole. But after the turn a No.3-iron of some 210 yards at the
long seventeenth produced his only other gain.
Forsbrand has lived in southern Spain for 13 years and no-one in this
field knows the characteristics of the course better than he. By his own
calculations he has played it more than 130 times.
He began with a bogey by driving into trees, but thereafter conceded
only two more strokes, when his second at the ninth, pulled on to a
tongue of grass in a bunker by the green, led to him taking four to
reach the green, and he had three putts at the short fifteenth.
Forsbrand birdied both long holes coming home, with a wedge to four
feet at the eleventh and, after having hit a No.3-iron shot over the
seventeenth green, hitting a chip three feet -- a more daunting prospect
than words alone could describe, for beyond the slick down slope of the
narrow green lies a pond.
Ian Woosnam, who shared third place on 141 with Jose Coceres, made
three successive birdies from the second by pitching to within inches of
each hole. But the supply dried up so completely that 32 out -- made to
look easy, so completely in control was he of his swing -- was followed
by a real struggle for 39 home.
Sandy Lyle also had 71 on a course where he had his last victory, in
this same tournament three years ago, when he beat Montgomerie in a
play-off. Lyle's victory in the 1987 Players' Championship bestowed a
10-year exemption for US tour events, a qualification he intends to make
the most of next year.

GRAND PRIX
DAVID Coulthard has never set foot on the tricky Japanese circuit at
Suzuka, so with this in mind the Scot was well pleased with himself
after having finished fifth fastest in the opening qualifying session
for tomorrow's Japanese Grand Prix.
''It is an absolutely fantastic track,'' said Coulthard. ''You never
know what is round the corner. When I went out it was pretty scary
because you have to force yourself to learn the track quickly.''
However, if Coulthard was upbeat, the same could not be said of his
team-mate Damon Hill, who could finish only second behind Michael
Schumacher.
''The car was running too low,'' said Hill. ''I came into the pits and
told them the problem. They took a look at it and the bottom of the car
had virtually melted away. At first it was quite comfortable, but then
it got uncomfortable.''
Fitted with a new plank on the Williams, Hill became the sixth driver
to hold the fastest lap -- only to see Schumacher take provisional pole
by six-tenths of a second on his final run.
The German -- who clinched his second championship after success in
the recent Pacific Grand Prix -- demonstrated his determination to end
the season by going all out for more wins.
The Ferrari-bound Schumacher also wants to leave Benetton with the
parting gift of the constructors' title. They lead Williams -- winners
for the past three years -- by 21 points. ''I won't feel relaxed and
express my emotions until we get that title,'' he said. ''But, having
won the championship, when I am in a fight on the track I can push
harder.''

'Rangers no longer seem the same force and Celtic are the main threat
to our title ambitions'
JOE MILLER
THE cloud of despondency which is gathering over Scottish football
could become larger depending on the fates which await Rangers, Celtic,
and Raith Rovers when they return to Europe next week.
However, the depression
might not be as severe as we imagine. At least Celtic manager Tommy
Burns doesn't think it is and if his side continue to strive for the
perfect attacking style, more people might begin to believe in a better
tomorrow.
Aberdeen, back in Glasgow for the second time inside a week, also
could help lift spirits if they maintain their impressive form which was
enough to put Rangers out of the Coca-Cola Cup in midweek and, indeed,
the Pittodrie side's winger, Joe Miller, believes the premier-division
championship will be won by one of the sides on show at Celtic Park.
''Rangers are now living on their reputation,'' he said. ''They no
longer seem the same force and Celtic are the main threat to our title
ambitions as they are a much better footballing side.''
Rangers, of course, won't think much of Miller's view but there is no
doubt that today's match at Celtic Park looks the most attractive of the
entire top-division programme, and it will be a special moment for Roy
Aitken when he returns to Celtic Park for the first time as a manager.
He has warm memories of the ground and the fans but said he intends to
mark the occasion at his former club's expense.
''We are focused on the championship and I want my players to be
arrogant in their approach, to believe they are as good as if not better
than their opponents,'' he said.
Burns said he has been encouraged by signs of a more cultured approach
to the game within the premier-division this season. ''Now that the
clubs have more or less been once around the block this season, the one
thing I have noticed is the willingness of teams to pass the ball,'' he
said.
''More clubs are trying to play a passing game and that has to be
encouraging.''
It also should suit a team like his because Celtic have always tried
to play an attractive, forward-moving game apart from a short spell when
Lou Macari seemed to be favouring a longer-ball style. Burns' side ought
to have a head start on everyone else who wishes to bring the ball down
and play with it on the turf, but still Celtic suffer from an inability
to equate their goals tally with time in possession.
A finishing edge is still a problem even though Pierre van Hooydonk
and Andreas Thom have been added to the squad, but Burns believes goals
will come if the players persevere with their style.
Thom burst a blood vessel in a foot during the match against
Kilmarnock last week, but he has made good progress and Burns hopes he
will report fit and able this afternoon. There is a doubt also about
Tosh McKinlay, but he should make it although the injured Phil O'Donnell
will not be risked.
Celtic play Paris St Germain on Thursday and trailing 1-0 from the
match in France, the premier-division side will have to find their
scoring touch if they are to make the next round of the European
Cup-winners' Cup. However, that match will be considered only after
Aberdeen have left for home.
''Depending on the opposition there might be a tendency for players to
think too far ahead if a European tie is coming up, but in this case I
don't think anyone will be looking beyond Aberdeen,'' Burns said.
''Our minds will be on the game against them and we will be
concentrating on getting the points. They got themselves a result
against Rangers in midweek and the last game we had against Aberdeen was
a fantastic match, and the fact that we have gone up to Aberdeen and won
in their backyard should give us some comfort.
''This is a challenge we relish and we are trying to play in a certain
way, a way I believe the game should be played. The priority when I came
was to win something in the first year, and having done that the problem
was then to find a system which would make us play, entertain, and also
be consistent.
''I realise, of course, that games have to be won and we will do that
more often when we take more of the chances made. It's a matter of
trying to make people better at what they are already doing well.''
Burns added that he has nothing but admiration for the manner in which
his former Celtic team-mate, Aitken, appears to be reviving Aberdeen and
pointed out: ''I never had any doubts he would succeed.''
The Dons deserved their Coca-Cola Cup win against Rangers and Aitken
has been telling his players that they need not feel overawed. ''I think
their cup win has helped them grow up and they will relish this task,''
he said.

JOHN Higgins got lucky in Sunderland last night as he stayed on course
to make a successful defence of his Skoda Grand Prix crown.
The 20-year-old defending champion won a dour all-Tartan duel with
fellow Scot Alan McManus 9-7.
But he needed a huge piece of good fortune in the latter stages to
help him over the line.
Leading the world No.6 from Glasgow by 7-6, Higgins rolled in a
clearance of 131 -- starting with an outrageous fluke on the first red.
It overtook Stephen Hendry's 129 on the high-break leaderboard and could
net Higgins #5000.
0 ''I was very fortunate to beat Alan,'' acknowledged Higgins. ''I
thought I had the running all night.''
The world No.11, hoping to defend the first of the three ranking
titles he won last year, continued: ''The semi-final is the hardest
round to get over.''
McManus, beginning the final session 5-3 adrift, levelled at 5-5 and
stayed in touch until the cruel twist of fate.
''It's part of the game and I don't think it was a turning point,''
said the gallant loser. ''I had umpteen chances and you have got to
accept flukes as part and parcel of the game.
''I never enjoy playing John because we get on so well away from the
table,'' added McManus, who has now lost three times in a row to his
great friend in the past five weeks.
''It was a tough game but I have got a day off and I will be ready for
the final,'' maintained Higgins, looking forward to a day off today as
Hendry takes on Steve James for the right to meet him in tomorrow's
final.

SECOND/THIRD DIVISIONS
JIM Leishman's Livingston continue their campaign atop the third
division with a home game today against Arbroath and, for at least two
more outings, ''home'' continues to be Meadowbank.
Original plans were for the new stadium to be opened in time for
today's fixture, but it looks as though the opening will be delayed at
least until the November 18 fixture against Cowdenbeath. As today, the
November 11 home match against East Stirlingshire will be at Meadowbank,
the football equivalent of Glencoe with its steep banks and silent,
ghostly atmosphere.
I have mentioned before that Livingston would like to keep their
unbeaten record at least until they move to their new home, attracting a
new support from the West Lothian town. But that is not quite enough for
Leishman. ''We would want to stay unbeaten -- full stop,'' he corrected.
With an unbeaten team to see, and the extrovert poet-cum-manager to
drum up support, it will be interesting to see how large an attendance
can be attracted when Livingston eventually do play at home.
The race behind Livingston has been hotting up and an exciting
encounter is in prospect at Brechin, where high-scoring Caledonian
Thistle are the visitors.
There are plenty of interesting fixtures upstairs, with Ayr's possible
revival being tested at Somerset Park by second division leaders, East
Fife. Stirling Albion and Berwick were promotion rivals last term and
battle it out today at Forthbank, with Albion seeking revenge for a 3-0
hammering two months ago. Stranraer will want to avenge an identical
beating by their visitors, Stenhousemuir, before Alex McAnespie's team
made their charge up the table.

FIRST DIVISION:
DUNFERMLINE, with more injury worries than they care to mention,
showed their determination to maintain a five-point lead at the top of
the first division by signing midfielder Brian Rice from Falkirk
yesterday in a deal worth around #25,000.
The 31-year-old Rice, formerly with Hibernian and Nottingham Forest
before moving to Falkirk, has superb skills, especially at setpieces and
is the type of left-sided player who could complement the Fifers' tall
attack when the likes of Andy Smith and Kenny Ward return after injury.
Meanwhile, he has Stewart Petrie and Greg Shaw to aim at for today's top
of the table clash against second-placed Dundee United at Tannadice.
Manager Bert Paton said yesterday: ''I have been chasing Rice for more
than a year, and I am delighted to have him on the books.''
Rice said: ''I have been in the reserves at Falkirk since August, so
I'm looking forward to getting back to first-team football.''
The Fifers also will be boosted by the return of striker Hamish French
for his first full game of the season, although Allan Moore, Craig
Robertson, Ward and the suspended Marc Millar will be missing.
Dundee United are looking more settled these days and they will be
along similar lines to the side which defeated Hamilton at Firhill last
week.
Just over the horizon, of course, is the Challenge Cup final against
Stenhousemuir, but manager Billy Kirkwood has been well educated. He
avoided the ''one-game-at-a-time'' remark, being slightly more subtle.
''We have Dunfermline and then Clydebank in the league before then.''
Airdrie and Dundee will be sick of the sight of one another as they
meet for the second time in four days, this time at Broadwood. Thoughts
of a backlash from a tousy midweek game come to mind, but both sets of
players are being urged to forget that midweek Coca-Cola Cup semi-final.
Assistant managers John McVeigh of Airdrie and Dundee's John McCormack
almost echoed one another: ''It's back to the bread and butter.''
In Airdrie's case that means putting behind them the disappointment of
their 2-1 defeat. ''It's a case of picking ourselves up, dusting
ourselves down, and getting on with it,'' said McVeigh, who also added
that Paul Jack would have a fitness test this morning.
McCormack said: ''We've got to go for the three points, especially
since Dundee United and Dunfermline are meeting at Tannadice.'' Dundee
have injury doubts about Paul Tosh and Roddy Manley.
Saints go marching out at McDiarmid Park, and it will be more of a
case of who is not playing than who will take the field. St Johnstone,
as well as having manager Paul Sturrock over in Spain recovering from
stress problems, will miss the injured Kevin McGowne and Gary Farquhar,
as well as the suspended Trevor Cherry and Jim Weir.
Assistant manager John Blackley adds ''fringe'' players Danny Griffin,
Stuart McCluskey and Euan Donaldson, while St Mirren manger Jimmy Bone
contemplates a replacement for Finnish internationalist Janne Mikela,
who has gone home to recover from the ligament injury suffered against
Airdrie last week.
Clydebank continue to be the great ''unpredictables,'' and they are
enjoying it. Having been defeated only twice this season, they want
three points against bottom club Hamilton at Kilbowie.
Hamilton are boosted by the return of defender Craig Paterson, as well
as Paul Hartley and Scott McCulloch.
* BIRMINGHAM have signed 22-year-old Norwegian international striker
Sigurd Rushfeldt from Tromso on a three-month loan with a view to a
#750,000 permanent signing.
Manager Barry Fry moved for Rushfeldt, capped seven times by Norway,
after learning Welsh international Jason Bowen would be out for at least
two weeks after a knee operation.

WALTER Smith and his players might have enjoyed an easy ride at the
club's annual meeting of shareholders the other day, but they can all be
certain of a much tougher time this afternoon at Stark's Park.
Raith Rovers have been faltering lately, but they know they can do
their confidence a power of good before Tuesday night's match in Munich
by beating Rangers.
The Ibrox club never seem entirely at ease in Kirkcaldy, but they go
there today comforted by the return of Richard Gough, who was missed
badly when Rangers lost to Aberdeen in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at
Hampden.
Gough, who had a groin injury, trained yesterday and if there are no
adverse effects this morning he will be back in place to marshall the
Rangers defence, which has conceded six goals in the last three matches.
Also back in contention is Charlie Miller, who has recovered
sufficiently from his shin splints problem to be given a place on the
bench.
The hope is Miller will play for a spell during the game and then be
in a state of readiness for the Champions' League match against Juventus
at Ibrox on Wednesday night.
''I still have a long casualty list, but I feel happier knowing that
these two at least are back,'' Smith said. ''We lost in Turin but came
back immediately with a good win in the premier division and now we are
in a similar situation.
''We suffered a cup defeat by Aberdeen in midweek and again we have to
show that we can recover quickly. We go to Kirkcaldy having to win and
I'm sure Raith feel they, too, have to win, because they have dropped
some points recently.''
Jimmy Nicholl's side are one of the most attractive in the premier
division when the mood strikes them, and one of their most dangerous
performers, Colin Cameron, is convinced Rangers will suffer today.
''It is true they never seem to settle properly at our place,'' said
Cameron. ''I don't know what it is, but I hope it continues.
''We have done well playing positive, attacking football and I don't
see any reason for us to change that. It will be important for us to
impose ourselves early on and hustle them out of their stride.''
Cameron now plays just behind the strikers and he feels it is a change
which will reap a handsome dividend, but his confidence should alarm
Rangers. More players throughout the premier division are coming to the
conclusion the Ibrox side are vulnerable these days as they wait for
their injured to return, but that should make Smith's players more
determined to underline their superiority.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten, who has managed to turn around his
side's fortunes, must wait for fitness checks on Tom Brown and Mark
Skilling before finalising his plans for the game against Hibernian at
Easter Road. On the plus side, midfield player Ally Mitchell is back
after suspension.
Hibs beat Kilmarnock 3-0 at Rugby Park earlier in the season, but that
was when Totten's side were playing without belief. ''Hibs are a well
organised side with good players, but my side are full of confidence now
and they can give anyone a good game,'' Totten said.
Chris McCart, who has missed the last two games, should be back in
Motherwell's defence for their game against Partick Thistle at Firhill.
''He has a good chance of being fit and his return would give everyone a
lift,'' said manager Alex McLeish, who is concerned that his side are
lingering too far off the premier division pace.
''I would settle for a 1-0 win against Thistle, even if the match
isn't something special to watch,'' he added. ''The main thing for us is
to pick up points.''
Thistle know Motherwell could still be fretting over last week's 4-2
defeat by Hibs and the Glasgow side are buoyed also by Ian Cameron's
decision to commit himself to the club for the remainder of the season.
He had been operating on temporary contracts and had played only as a
substitute in the last two matches.
''However, he is right back in the frame now,'' said manager Murdo
Macleod, who confirmed Hearts' interest in the player. ''But I am trying
to build a team, not break one up,'' he added.
MacLeod needs to see a vast improvement in his team after last week's
3-0 defeat by Aberdeen and he may continue playing.
''I still enjoy it, but we really have to show an improvement in our
work,'' he said. ''Motherwell are dangerous and always offer problems.''

MANCHESTER United will lay out the red carpet when Bryan Robson
returns to Old Trafford this afternoon, and he may even play at some
stage in the match.
The former England captain goes back for the first time to the stage
he graced for 13 years when he leads Middlesbrough into the biggest test
yet of their Premiership credentials.
While the arrival of the Brazilian, Juninho, has been delayed -- he is
now expected to make his debut against Leeds next week -- Robson's
return to Manchester has been awaited eagerly.
Robson has guided 'Boro to promotion and now up to an impressive
fourth place in their first season back in the big time, with his
capture of Nick Barmby, as well as the Brazilian, proving the lure of
his name.
Barmby, Craig Hignett, and John Hendrie need late fitness tests so
Robson, yet to appear this term, could make a surprise appearance on the
'Boro bench.

<TEXT>
MORTON'S Derek McInnes will be free to join Rangers this weekend
following a surprise development last night.
The 24-year-old midfielder wrote to the club yesterday, seeking to
exercise an agreed opt-out in his contract. Last summer he signed a
one-year contract -- and a clause was added that would allow him to move
on if an offer over an agreed figure was made.
Rangers have made a formal bid of around #300,000, which brings into
play the contract breaker. Under the agreement, Morton have five working
days to negotiate the fee upward or produce a higher bidder. That time
has now elapsed. The Ibrox club tabled their bid on Monday and the
talented midfield player will now become Walter Smith's latest recruit.
''In my opinion Derek McInnes can now go ahead and sign for Rangers or
any club who have met the criteria,'' confirmed the player's agent, Bill
McMurdo.
It all adds up to another outstanding piece of business by Smith,
which ends a chase by a host of clubs from both sides of the Border.
McInnes last night sent a copy of his letter to the Scottish League,
together with copies of his unique contract.
Meanwhile, Hearts moved into the transfer market yesterday and signed
French international keeper Gilles Rousset on a short-term contract. If
a few loose ends can be tied up this morning, the 6ft 5in keeper will
make his debut against Falkirk at Brockville.
A day of negotiations ended around six o'clock when manager Jim
Jefferies emerged from talks with 32-year-old Rousset and his agent to
confirm a deal had been done. ''It is only short-term at the moment, but
we'll have further discussions in the next couple of weeks about
something more permanent,'' said Jefferies.
''He's looked good in training and the negotiations have been lengthy,
but I'm glad something has been sorted out.''
Rousset arrives at Tynecastle with an impressive pedigree. He has had
spells with Sochaux, Lyon, Marseille, and Rennes, and as well as two
appearances for France at full international level, he was also capped
eight times as an Under-21.
Jefferies returns to Brockville this afternoon with the wanted posters
still out for him in Falkirk, but the Hearts manager better get used to
being the man everyone loves to hate, because it might not be too long
before he is as unpopular at Tynecastle as he is at his old stomping
ground.
After his messy divorce from the Bairns, Jefferies' arrival at Hearts
was greeted as a marriage made in heaven, but with a quarter of the
season gone, the honeymoon is now over.
''When I came in, everybody got a lift, and if it had continued like
that, this job would have been easy,'' says Jefferies. ''It's up to me
to make the environment at the club good enough for the players to
produce their best -- and if they don't do it, there must be changes.
''It's not my reputation which is on the line. I've told the players I
have nothing to lose -- they are the ones who have been struggling over
the past couple of years.
''The most important thing is Hearts, not me or any individual. If
certain things have to be done, I'll have no hang-ups about doing
them.''

US TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP
BRILLIANT Brad Bryant carded a two-under-par 68, equal to the day's
lowest score, to grab the lead after the second round at the $3m US Tour
Championship yesterday in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Bryant, one of the hottest players in the world over the past month,
garnered four birdies in strong winds at Southern Hills to post a
three-under 137 halfway total.
He leads by one stroke from fellow American Billy Mayfair (70), while
US Tour rookie Woody Austin (68) is two shots behind.
Nick Faldo, the lone European in the elite 30-man field, is equal
twenty-fourth, a distant 11 strokes off the pace after a 72.
Although the wind blew strongly for the second straight day, it came
from a different quarter yesterday, and the course played more than one
shot easier, averaging 71.7 strokes.
Faldo, who hit only seven of 14 fairways, said: ''I played okay. It
was marginally better than yesterday.''
He made a demoralising start, with three-putt bogeys at the first and
third holes, and did not record his first birdie of the week until the
eleventh, ending a 28-hole drought.
Bryant, meanwhile, continued the outstanding streak that catapulted
him to his first tour victory at the Walt Disney World Golf Classic
three weeks ago.
''It was a tough day. The wind is making the putting harder than the
ball-striking,'' said Bryant, who, because of his generally dishevelled
appearance, is nicknamed ''Doctor Dirt''.
He bogeyed the first hole, but fought back to grab the lead with his
final birdie of the day at the par-4 seventeenth.
''There was one point today we were just trying to hold on and make
pars. It just howled,'' he said.
Despite the conditions, Bryant said there was little pressure playing
for so much money. ''It's the only place in the world you can make a
fool of yourself and still get 50 grand,'' he quipped. Leading scores
(US unless stated):
137 -- Brad Bryant 69, 68.
138 -- Billy Mayfair 68, 70.
139 -- Woody Austin 71, 68.
140 -- Vijay Singh (Fiji) 69, 71; Justin Leonard 70, 70.
141 -- Loren Roberts 73, 68; Tom Lehman 71, 70; Scott Simpson 71, 70.
142 -- Greg Norman (Australia) 72, 70; Corey Pavin 72, 70.
143 -- David Duval 74, 69; Peter Jacobsen 73, 70; Steve Elkington
(Australia) 71, 72.
144 -- Payne Stewart 69, 75.
Other notables:
145 -- Ernie Els (South Africa) 71, 74.
147 -- Davis Love 74, 73; Ben Crenshaw 74, 73; Mark Calcavecchia 72,
75.
148 -- Nick Faldo (England) 76, 72.
150 -- Nick Price (Zimbabwe) 77, 73.
* MASASHI ''Jumbo'' Ozaki shot a three-under-par 69 to take a two-shot
lead after two rounds of the Philip Morris championship at Tojo in
Japan.
After starting the round tied with Harumitsu Hamano and Hidemichi
Tanaka, Ozaki notched four birdies against one bogey for an
eight-under-par aggregate of 136 over the 7176-yard, par-72 ABC Golf
Club course in western Japan.
Nobumitsu Yuhara fired a 69 for 138 and was two shots behind Ozaki.
American Jim Furyk turned in a 69 and was tied for third at 139.
Leading aggregates (Japanese unless otherwise stated):
136 -- M Ozaki 67, 69.
138 -- N Yuhara 69, 69.
139 -- J Furyk (USA) 70, 69; I Shirahama 69, 70; N Ozaki 69, 70.
140 -- D Ishii (USA) 69, 71; H Tanaka 67, 73.
141 -- B Watts (USA) 71, 70; S Ginn (Australia) 69, 72.

SWORD Beach is taken as the selection today in the feature race at
Kelso, the Andy Scott Chase.
The veteran chaser has seen a few things since running third to
Another Coral in the 1991 Mackeson and has moved stables from Peter
Easterby to Mary Reveley.
His edge may have been blunted but he retains his enthusiasm for
racing, as he showed last week when an easy winner at Newcastle.
That followed a series of disappointing efforts but he may now have
struck form and should have too much speed for his rivals.
Kilcolgan is a decent sort but would prefer a longer trip on easier
going, along with Peter Monteith's interesting acquisition, Emerald
Storm.
Thistle Princess looks a lively outsider in the Salvesen Food Chase.
The young grey won cosily on her chasing debut at Bangor in April and
was travelling well when a faller at this course next time out.
She may have disliked the softish conditions when pulled up on her
reappearance and poses a serious threat to the favourite, Beldine.
* AN air of quiet confidence enveloped the British and Irish team on
the eve of the twelfth Breeders' Cup yesterday -- all that's needed now
is the right sign from above.
Spirits have soared since the eight British-trained horses, led by
Halling, plus the Irish filly Ridgewood Pearl jetted into New York for
racing's world cup.
Preparations have been completed without hitch and the omens look good
for a meeting every bit as memorable as the last battle at Belmont five
years ago, Europe's most successful championships.
Only the real prospect of heavy rain, forecast to hit the area today,
threatens to dampen justifiable enthusiasm for the contests ahead.
Ominously for the Americans Godolphin, which has carried virtually all
before them during a phenomenal campaign, are sounding bullish about
Halling's chance in the Classic against Cigar.
''We are as happy with him as we were before he ran in the Eclipse and
the International. Physically he has not stopped developing,'' said
racing manager Simon Crisford.
''He has settled in beautifully and if he can reproduce his best form
on the dirt, and we believe he will.
''There is no reason why he won't be right in there with a great
chance of winning.

WATCHING double Olympian Emma Carrick-Anderson as she laughingly
quaffed a celebratory glass of champagne this week, reinforced all of
the traditional preconceptions about her sport of skiing: glamorous,
self-indulgent, expensive -- the high life to which one might aspire if
one only had the money, and the ability.
Her passport bears a catalogue of entry stamps which most can only
dream of, the resorts she frequents -- Tignes, Vail, Saas Fee -- being
the accustomed preserve of those in pursuit of the sweet life: the very
well-heeled, or those working their passage, relieving the ageing
tensions of a sugar daddy, having travelled club-class to some five-star
hotel.
Pert and pretty, confident and articulate, not to mention explosively
talented, the 20-year-old from Dunblane would provoke an unhealthily
envious, bitchy reaction among many of her sex.
Yet like her sport, as Emma reveals, all is not as it seems.
''A lot of people believe my life is extremely glamorous,'' says the
girl whose seventh in the Olympic slalom at the age of 16 in Albertville
was Britain's best individual result.
''They think my life is a permanent ski holiday. It's so bad I've
given up trying to explain it is like another day at the office -- I
just laugh it off.
''It's not five-star hotels -- more likely five people in a cramped
self-catering chalet training together. When competing, it's often very
lonely. I am away from home for eight months a year. After I have eaten,
I'm cooped up, sitting alone in some pokey hotel room.
''Tearful nights? Yes. Quite often,'' she confides. ''I need friends
around. It's nothing like the image people have, of discos and apres
ski. I spend many nights writing letters.''
Carrick-Anderson was speaking high on the slopes of Aonach Mor, during
an infrequent visit home, the wine a token of her celebrity status after
opened a new chairlift.
But it is one of the last she will enjoy for months. She leaves today
for a few days' work at the London ski show, then heads next weekend for
Colorado, and the opening World Cup event in Colorado.
''Don't take this the wrong way,'' she insists. ''I don't view my
lifestyle as a sacrifice. Skiing is my whole life. I enjoy a glass of
wine, but during the season I don't drink at all.''
The daughter of a Dunblane solicitor, youngest of three children, she
envisaged no other future after first standing on skis aged two.
Though she has twice contested the Olympics, her aspirations are now
on a higher plane. Higher than the Olympics?
''Well, yes. I am doing the full Europa and World Cup circuits for the
first time (some 25 races) and it is far harder to excel in the World
Cup than the Olympics,'' she explains. ''You have only four people from
each country per event at the Olympics. In the World Cup, all of the
best skiers are present. There could easily be 10 Austrians, 10 Swiss,
10 Italians, and so on, per event -- any one of whom would be good
enough to represent their country at the Olympics.''
Ranked No.100 in the world in giant slalom last season, and ''around
40'' in the slalom, she says: ''I believe, long term, that I can finish
in the top five in the World Cup and Olympics.''
Sufficiently charismatic to have landed enough personal backing --
from Vital, an Austrian hotel, and Air Tours -- to scrimp through the
season, she deplores the shoestring existence forced on the sponsorless
UK team.
Her boyfriend, Aviemore's Alain Baxter, is Britain's No.1 male slalom
exponent, but lacking Emma's high profile, spent the summer working
10-hour days in a bar, then training nights in the gym. Ironically, he
landed backing from an anonymous donor just three days ago.
Emma's own hopes for the coming winter, however, have gone downhill in
recent days, with a serious accident to Newton Mearns skier Sandra
McArthur (formerly Wilson), the only other UK female qualified for the
World Cup, who would have roomed with her.
McArthur, only recently recovered from a knee injury which she was
told could put her in a wheelchair for life, suffered a triple leg
fracture and is now out for the season.
''Last winter was miserable,'' reveals Emma. ''My Swedish coach and I
were on the circuit on our own. He's a married man, and though we get on
fine, it's a pretty unnatural existence. After five months on the
circuit, sometimes 10 hours a day in a car, travelling, we were getting
on one another's nerves. We had nothing left to say to each other.
''Off the hill, you need the kind of nonsense you talk about with
another girl. Sandra would have preserved my sanity. Without her, I
can't see me lasting past February.
'' I would never quit, but there will have to be something done. I
will either fly home at my own expense, for a break, or the ski
federation have suggested they might allow a friend to visit for a few
days.''
But nobody should doubt her commitment. She gave up Scotland, spending
four years at a specialist Austrian government school for skiers, where
all classes, including accounts and shorthand, were in German.
''At 15 it was tough, going there not knowing anyone and not speaking
the language very well. Although I did German in Scotland, and had a
six-week crash course before leaving, I didn't understand much of the
lessons for the first month. I wondered if I had made a mistake. I was
often homesick in the first two years.''
Her mum, Rosemary, and father, Chris, agonised over her aspirations.
Their elder daughter is a solicitor, while son Ronald was an
international skier who quit because of financial pressures.
''It was a wrench to let Emma go,'' says Chris. ''But she was always
so determined about what she wanted to do. I think if a child really
knows what they want, it's important that parents don't try to push in a
different direction.''

HELICOPTERS building a new ski facility were grounded by hot air
during a glorious summer -- but this week the official opening of a new
chairlift on Aonach Mor was made on schedule, doubling the area of
accessible snow to make it the largest ski area in Britain.
A 1100-metre chairlift and 385-metre T-bar tow were completed at a
cost of #779,000 -- private, enterprise, and European money --
increasing the capacity of the uplift facilities at the Nevis Range
resort to nearly 9000 people per hour, and opening up a wealth of new
runs.
The weather should have been a boon to constructors, but warm air is
less dense than cool air, and, for five weeks of an atypical summer, the
workhorse aircraft being used to minimise environmental impact were
unable to fly thousands of tonnes of equipment on to the 4006ft
mountain.
There was full consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage, but the
development took almost three years, in the face of lobbying prompted
because the lifts increase access to a special area of conservation.
Ian Sykes, managing director of Nevis Range, confirms there is an
agreement not to develop skiing in that location, though work will begin
next year on a further lift in Coire Dubh, closer to the conservation
site in Coire a' Coire Rais.
The new lifts give access to higher nursery snow as well as what is
claimed will be the country's best off-piste skiing. The north-east
facing corries will provide a rarely-sampled luxury for UK skiers --
frequent powder snow -- while the lift to be completed next summer will
access a sheltered area which holds late spring snow.
''I don't want to get into an argument with Cairngorm -- they will
still have about three times our uplift capacity -- but I believe we now
have Britain's biggest area of skiable snow,'' said Sykes.
Skiing is worth #30m annually to the north economy, and Fort William
has enjoyed improved economic growth since the complex was opened five
years ago, with, Sykes notes, ''local children starting to ski -- not
just upper-class families.''
It was, he said, a significant achievement at a time when some US and
continental resorts have gone broke. Perhaps provocatively, he suggests
there is considerable scope for further development. Though of similar
size to Austria, with a similar proportion of mountain area, Scotland
has just five ski complexes to Austria's 700.

THREE men's clubs remain unbeaten after the first month of the league
season, Edinburgh Burger Kings and Glasgow Brightsiders having four wins
each and Livingston Bulls three.
Kings, who came through a tough away test at Edzell last Saturday, put
their record on the line against Paisley at Meadowbank tonight.
Australian Greg Gurr, who was with Derby last season, has made a
considerable difference to the Edinburgh team's court discipline and
their fitness but they have still to spark offensively.
Paisley have two experienced internationalists in Jim Mitchell and
Drew Grimsley who could topple Kings if allowed to shoot.
''We're looking to play quality defence for as long as possible so
that it starts to become a habit,'' said Gurr.
Kings have fitness worries over Paul Bjarnson and Paul Ogilvie, who
have bronchial complaints, and Graham Bailey who has a pulled calf
muscle.
But Ross Szifris will be back in the line-up after having missed last
week's game.
Edzell, meanwhile, are guests of Brightsiders at Easterhouse tomorrow,
while the champions, Livingston Bulls entertain Strathkelvin at the
Forum and should keep their unbeaten record.
Livingston women shocked champions Polonia Phoenix last weekend and
will expect to take care of improving Brightsiders in the first half of
a double-header at the Forum.

PETER Dods was never the man to blink first when adversity was staring
him in the face.
He has needed to display great character these past few weeks as Gala
have become the whipping boys of the SRU Tennents Premiership. With just
one win and a draw to show from nine outings, the Netherdale club are
anchored at the foot of the table, and unless the school of thought
which favours 10-team divisions prevails, it seems almost certain that
the second division beckons.
Yesterday, Dods the coach declared: ''Well, we seem to have been
saying this for quite a few weeks but tomorrow against Boroughmuir
really represents our last chance. We've just got to start winning.
''The thing is, we haven't been playing as badly as the results
suggest, and if we can get a break we can win. There's no doubt about
that. When we last played Boroughmuir we had 80% possession but they won
25-10.
''That's been our problem. At one stage we were saying that we had to
get a pack that could win ball. When Stolz came we achieved that. By
then, though, brother Mike and Gregor Townsend had left for
Northampton.''
Dods says that the club have a contingency plan for any eventually
once the premiership has been decided. ''Obviously, we are still hoping
against hope that we're going to stay up, but we're looking ahead and
one of the main things we realise is that we cannot afford to lose any
more players.''
Just as nothing succeeds like success, there is nothing -- especially
in the Borders -- which resembles a lead balloon as a once dominant side
which is going through bad times.
''It has been hard and I wouldn't try to suggest otherwise but I think
that the supporters know that you can only work with the players you've
got, and that they're all trying their hardest. One day the result will
come and, hopefully, it will be tomorrow,'' he said.
Elsewhere, Heriot's FP may struggle to overcome the memory of their
43-0 thrashing by Watsonians last time out, Melrose need a win over
Hawick to restore respectability to their title chase, and Edinburgh
Academicals and Stirling County, lying cheek by jowl in the league, are
probably too close to call. May the best team win.
* CRAIG Chalmers has pulled out of the Melrose side due to play
against Hawick today. ''I damaged the shoulder and it was always likely
that I wouldn't be playing,'' said Chalmers. ''And besides, I got soaked
on Wednesday helping out at a coaching clinic and I've got a dose of the
flu.''
* THE Scottish Rugby Union is to operate a weather information line
for up-to-the-minute news on games that are affected by inclement
weather. Club secretaries with postponed games and concerned spectators
are asked to telephone 0131 346 5000.

I HEAR things are not hunky-dory in the Glasgow District League, with
the threat of a club rebellion providing the whiff of an intoxicating
excitement in the air as yet more reconstruction hits Scottish rugby,
this time in the lower, but, nevertheless, precious, reaches of the big
city's rugby community.
There also are rumours that seven national league clubs, fed up with
country-wide travelling, have indicated that they want to join the
district league.
Murray Houston, secretary of Kilmacolm club, Birkmyre, has written to
other clubs in Division 2 of the league asking if they, like Birkmyre,
feel that they were never consulted in the process of change, a process
he believes will make many clubs lose incentive. Birkmyre say they found
out only three weeks ago -- during the season -- that there was no
prospect of them going up. Mutiny chaps, mutiny.
''At the moment there are two divisions, the first has 14 teams and
the second 13, but we have now been told that it is to be reorganised to
a 10-team first division, playing home and away, and a second division
of 17 sides playing each other once,'' says Houston.
''We are chasing promotion to get into the first division, but now we
are told that at the end of this season, there will be no promotion. The
players are wasting their time every Saturday, which is no use, and it
is fair to say that we are very unhappy and want to find out if other
clubs feel the same. I have written to all of the other clubs in our
division to find out their views, and to find out whether they were
consulted.''
What makes matters worse, according to Houston, is that at the annual
meeting last year an agreement was reached for no change in the league
set-up. Strathclyde Police suggested home and away, but the clubs
understood that was not to happen after having responded to the detailed
police paper.
George Hardie, president of second-division new boys Bishopton, agrees
with the Birkmyre attitude. ''For us it doesn't matter, but Birkmyre are
the best team we have played against and what is the point to it all if
there is no promotion for the best,'' he said. ''I don't think that
anyone is happy about it, and I don't think that anyone is clear about
what is happening.''
It was Hardie who said that he had been told of seven clubs wanting to
parachute from the national to district leagues, although the seven
names have not yet been revealed.
Houston goes on to say that he feels that unless his club goes up to
the first division, the rape and pillage of young players, attracted
like moths to bigger clubs in the city, will continue.
David Millar, secretary of the district set-up, says the clubs wanted
change, and he wrote to them in June telling them of the alteration to
the league, which was now to run on the lines of the Premier League with
a reduced number of sides in the top flight, and the games played home
and away.
''Birkmyre changed their secretary this year, and the letter went to
the old one,'' explained Millar. ''The committee understood from the
annual meeting that the clubs wanted change, and so this was the best
solution, giving the clubs more games than before, as well as the cup.
We realise that there is no promotion from Division 2 this season, but
whoever ends up top will receive a trophy.
''We wrote to all of the clubs, and asked for their responses after
having examined the police proposal, which was a very detailed one
indeed and one that we backed. If what you are telling me is that the
clubs are now unhappy, then I will report this to the committee.''
Forgive me for poking at anything the police have put forward -- most
of my ancestors were bobbies -- but it does indeed look as though some
of the clubs are indeed less than happy.
It's difficult at that level, and again this isn't said demeaning the
league, but while some of the clubs, like Birkmyre, will harbour dreams
of greatness, others play for the love of the game.
What it shows is that wherever there is a body in charge of rugby then
that body can appear aloof to its members, while at the same time doing
what it thinks is a good job.
Many of the players and committee men lower down the leagues might be
involved more for fun and a love of the game than competition, but the
views of all of them have to be taken into account; especially when it
comes to changing the set-up.
No promotion? What does that mean? Well, to butcher an old saying,
where there are no prizes, there aren't any points. Birkmyre see no
point to this kerfuffle, that's for sure.
' The players are wasting their time every Saturday and it is fair to
say that we are very unhappy '

SCOTTISH youth internationalist Scott Plews makes his comeback for
Fife Flyers in the Benson and Hedges Cup semi-final first-leg clash with
Sheffield Steelers at Kirkcaldy tonight.
Defenceman Plews, who left the Rosslyn Street club two years ago for
premier division Murrayfield Racers, before moving on to first division
outfit Telford Tigers, is new player-coach Mark Morrison's first signing
since taking over from Ronnie Plumb in mid-week.
Morrison said: ''We're looking for Scott to add steel to our defence
and are confident he can do a job for us.''
The other semi-final, between Humberside and Nottingham, takes place
tomorrow.
Elsewhere, Paisley Pirates give new defencemen Paul Hand and Neil
Finnerty their home debuts tomorrow against Manchester Storm.

GLASGOW'S Tommy Gilmour finds himself in a rare, if not unique,
situation tonight when three of his boxers will challenge for titles at
three different venues, London, Bristol and Paris. But the
manager-promoter is not in the slightest worried that he can only lend
vocal support to one of them.
Gilmour will be at the Albert Hall in London to see Stephen Wilson, of
Wallyford, meet Welshman Joe Calzaghe for the vacant British
super-middleweight championship, which has been vacated by Sam Storey.
Yesterday Gilmour said: ''I don't go into the corner with my boxers
any more -- I just attend to the business side. Of course, I would love
to be with all three, but it's not so important.
''I am very fortunate in that I have great strength in depth among my
trainers, so none of my boxers will be at a disadvantage tomorrow
night.''
Dunky Jowett, the best cuts man in the business, and Benny King will
be in Wilson's corner, while George Borden and Kris McAdam will travel
to Bristol with Charlie Kane, who challenges local man Ross Hale for the
British and Commonwealth light-welter titles.
The third man is Sunderland featherweight Billy Hardy, who travels to
the suburbs of Paris for a meeting with European champion Mehdi
Labdouni, and he will be looked after by the vastly experienced Paddy
Byrne.
Said Gilmour: ''My lads are all involved in very tough contests, but
not one of them has less than half a chance -- I would say they are all
50-50 fights.
''Calzaghe has been getting a great build-up and has stopped 12 of his
13 opponents. Obviously, he is good, but Stephen has lost only once in
his professional career and has fought better quality opposition than
Calzaghe.
''It also looks a tall order for Charlie Kane, but I don't think Ross
Hale will be looking forward to fighting a southpaw, who is over six
feet in height. Charlie could win it at long range. He is also very
strong and can hit.
''Of the three, I am least worried about Billy Hardy. He is a vastly
experienced boxer, who has been over the course before. In fact,
tomorrow will see him involved in his fifteenth championship fight. All
he needs is a fair crack of the whip from the European judges.''
Calzaghe, regarded by co-manager Terry Lawless as one of the best
prospects he has ever seen, will be made to work harder against Wilson
and the 23-year-old relishes that. ''I'd be happy with a hard fight, a
real test. I'm strong and fit enough to go 15 rounds if I had to,'' said
the former three-time ABA champion. ''This gives me a chance to show my
capabilities.''
Hale is a tough professional, but has had problems against elusive
opponents in the past and Kane is certainly elusive. However, the
champion is confident he can hold on to his titles with a late stoppage.
Hardy will have to produce something really special to unseat European
featherweight champion Labdouni.
The Algerian-born Labdouni has defeated Steve Robinson, and in April
his non-stop pressuring beat the more cultured boxing of Duke McKenzie
at Fontenay.
Hardy has made two previous journeys to France, resulting in a draw
and a loss. It may only be third-time-lucky if the Sunderland man can
find the power to halt the come-forward champion.

BRITISH downhiller Graham Bell has slammed the way this country's ski
team is funded.
The British Ski Federation's grant from the Sports Council has been
cut from #325,000 in the run up to the Lillehammer Olympics to #120,000
as they prepare for the 1998 Games.
And British No.1 Bell, who is aiming for a place in the world's top 30
this season, said the situation is ''ridiculous''.
''Sport in this country is the worst funded in the whole of Western
Europe and it's ridiculous,'' said Bell.
''We're decades behind and they don't seem to realise what I'm doing
is a career.''
Graham's brother Martin, who retired from the sport because of the
financial restraints, echoed the sentiments.
''The current policy of funding is going to force the mass retirement
of all potential world cup skiers in Britain because it is not a viable
option economically,'' he said.

STEWART Hamilton -- big and bluff, no frills, likes the odd cigar, and
an occasional glass of the amber nectar -- will be out there for
Stirling County against Edinburgh Academicals at Raeburn Place today
giving his all, as he has done for more years than he cares to remember.
Big Hammy, for whom the big four-oh beckons in February, is the
godfather of premiership rugby, and at a time of life when most players
have long since traded the rigours of the top-grade game for the
committee room or a spot of punditry on Rugby Special, he is still
there, Saturday in and Saturday out, competing with the young bloods who
weren't even born when he came, late, to the game as a 22-year-old.
But Hamilton, the purveyor of farm equipment who starts his own
business in Stirling on Wednesday, is still earning his corn as a
hard-grafting lock with County, the club he has served -- barring three
seasons with Heriot's FP in the mid-eighties -- since enlisting with
them from that hot-bed of rugby, Larkhall, almost 18 years ago.
''There wasn't much rugby played in Larkhall,'' he says, with just a
hint of understatement, ''but being in the farm-equipment business I was
mixing with farmers and it was Muff Scobie and Hamish Logan who said
that, with my size, I should be playing rugby.''
So much has changed since County were beginning their climb from the
nether regions of Division 6 and Hamilton has played through them all.
Regrets? He has a few.
Most notably, the fact that after two 'B' caps against France, in 1986
and '87, he just couldn't make that final leap towards a full cap.
''That remains a major regret. I felt at the time that I was capable of
playing for Scotland. When I saw the likes of Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton
getting a cap, I just knew that I was a better player but I didn't get
the final nod.
''That was why I went to Heriot's. I got a phone call from Andy
Irvine. He was obviously a rugby hero and when somebody like Irvine
rings you up and asks if you'd like to come down to Goldenacre, then
you'd be daft to say no.
''I was loyal to Stirling, just as I am now, but I was loyal to
myself, too, and I really wanted that cap. Stirling were stuck in the
second division and I reckoned that first-division rugby would give me
the final boost I needed.''
There have been compensations but Hamilton doesn't try to kid on that
they make up for not playing for Scotland. ''I've played in district
championship sides with Edinburgh and Glasgow, and this season I'll be
trying to make it a hat trick with North and Midlands.
''And, of course, the greatest compensation of all was captaining
Stirling to the championship last season. I couldn't even begin to tell
you how sweet that was.''
Hamilton, just a sliver short of 6ft 4in. and still tipping the scales
at the 18st he did as a 22-year-old, reckons that players are now more
dedicated and committed than they were when he was starting out.
He believes, too, that the game is not as physical as it was when he
was learning his craft at the coal-face of lineout and scrum. ''There
aren't the really hard men around now that there used to be. When I was
at Heriot's and we were playing the likes of Hawick, there were maybe
half-a-dozen characters who could put the fear of death into you.
''Maybe they're still around and they just don't put the fear of death
into me any longer but I don't think so. There were some hard nuts
playing in the early and mid-eighties. The game has progressed, the laws
have changed, and there doesn't seem to be any time for the battles that
used to break out all over the place.
''There's a metre between the forwards at the lineouts now and that's
where most of the battles used to break out. It's difficult to give your
opposite number a skelp when there's all that space between you. Mind
you, the good news is that he can't skelp you either.''
After Stirling's championship win last season Hamilton had hinted that
he might retire from top-flight rugby and yet he is still there and
happy in his work.
''A couple of weeks ago we had a 16-year-old playing for us against
Hawick. I'm old enough to be his father and I don't recognise that many
people on the team bus, right enough, but I don't feel my age when I'm
out there on the pitch.
''I've promised my elder son, Gregor, who is 12 and a centre for his
school side at Dollar Academy, that one day we'll both play in the same
side. Obviously that won't be first XV rugby but I'm not hanging up the
boots until that promise has been fulfilled.
''So far as retirement from top-grade rugby is concerned, I've told
the club that I'm more than happy to soldier on until they find a
replacement. I wouldn't begrudge any youngster coming into the side and
taking my place if the club felt he was good enough.
''After that I'll keep playing for fun and until Gregor and me have
run out on to the park together. But, hopefully, I've still got a good
few games in me before then,'' he declares.

IT has been a quiet week on the rugby front, as can be gauged from the
fact that, for the past couple of days, I've been engaged in the highly
glamorous task of muck-spreading on the farm.
Don't believe the stories about the new professional rugby player
enjoying better terms and conditions than Santa Claus (one day's work a
year and unlimited use of the company reindeer).
Professional footballers might train in the morning and then spend the
rest of their time in snooker halls or other venues of ill-repute, but
rugby players still have to put in a hard day's graft at the office --
or in my case, farm -- and even when the professionalism thing is up and
running properly, I would reckon that this is still liable to be the
case.
The Scotland side to play Western Samoa at Murrayfield on November 18
will be picked within the next couple of days. I must admit that, even
when you have been around for a few years like I have, you never take
anything for granted. It's still a relief when you get that letter from
the SRU telling you that you are in.
With the retiral of Gavin Hastings, the full-back position is one that
I'm sure the selectors will be burning much midnight oil over. I suppose
that in the opinion of most rugby folk, Rowen Shepherd and Mike Dods are
the two main contenders -- and there's always the possibility that Scott
Hastings could maintain the Hastings family tradition by pulling on the
No.15 jersey -- but over the last couple of weeks, I've been asked
whether I might be a candidate to attempt the impossible and try to fill
Gavin's boots.
Well, only the selectors can answer that one. So far as I'm concerned,
I'd play anywhere for Scotland. Just so long as I can pull on that blue
shirt. However, I've never made any secret of the fact that full back is
my favourite position.
I made my Scotland debut at full back against Australia in Brisbane in
1992. I'd played full back for my club and went on to do so for Glasgow
before switching to the left wing. At Bridgehaugh, Craig Sangster is
playing some superb rugby from full back, although the Scotland under-21
selectors have picked him at centre to play against the New Zealand
Under-21 side on Wednesday.
Because Craig is playing so well there's no doubt that the Stirling
side would be weakened if I were to push for a switch. It would be
selfish of me to do so and the club come first.
I'm attracted to full back because you're always much more involved.
On the wing you might see the ball twice or thrice in a match. At full
back there is almost constant involvement. Maybe that's where I'll end
up but it's not something that's top of my agenda. If I switch
eventually, then that will be a decision for others. Just now I'm happy
to play for Stirling, or Glasgow, or Scotland, wherever they want to put
me.
Last week I wrote that we might have scuppered our Premiership
chances, but we would still have a significant say in the outcome of the
championship. Well, didn't we then go out and beat Watsonians.
Today we're down at Raeburn Place, where we expect a tough old tussle
against a side who have the capacity to beat anybody but have been hard
hit by injury virtually since the start of the season.
Boroughmuir are now in the driving seat. They've still got us to play
and, of course, we'll beat them again (how's that for positive
thinking?) but, County aside, the biggest danger that they face is
themselves.
If they can keep it all together then they'll be champions. Today,
though, down at Gala, they have to win the kind of game that they have a
reputation for losing. It's the possibility of that happening week in
and week out, right across the premiership, which has made this such an
intriguing championship season.

THE Scotland International Players' Trust, which will be the entity
through which Scotland's internationalists will continue to be paid
during the new ''open'' regime, meets tomorrow at Murrayfield as the
players take part in the final squad session prior to selection for the
first Test of the new era, against Western Samoa on November 18, writes
Derek Douglas.
The Trust, comprising players' representatives Rob Wainwright and
Craig Chalmers, the players' agent Ian McLauchlan, plus SRU senior
vice-president Fred McLeod, director of rugby Jim Telfer, and
committee-man Ken Crichton, now faces a race against time to hammer out
a contract which is acceptable to all.
The SRU set up a working party of lawyers -- including backs' coach
David Johnston -- accountants, and personnel experts in an effort to
have a contract ready before the Murrayfield international against the
Samoans.
The side will be chosen within the next few days with an announcement
on Wednesday, and it would appear that the contract and the Scotland
call-up papers are now liable to arrive on the doorsteps of the
individuals concerned at one and the same time.

ENGLAND last night sprang a massive surprise by revealing pneumonia
victim Gary Connolly will start today's World Cup final against
champions Australia.
Connolly has missed all four of England's World Cup games so far after
being struck down by the illness late last month and his best hope of
appearing in the Wembley showdown appeared to be as a substitute.
But he will line-up in the centre with his Wigan team-mate Barrie-Jon
Mather -- included in the original 13 yesterday -- now one of the four
substitutes.
England coach Phil Larder has called in Keighley centre Nick Pinkney
as cover for Connolly.
Pinkney and Mather join Wigan utility pack star Mick Cassidy and St
Helens back row forward Chris Joynt, the two substitutes already named.
Teams:
England -- Radlinski; Robinson, Connolly (all Wigan), Newlove
(Bradford), Offiah (Wigan); Smith (Castleford), Goulding (St Helens);
Harrison (Halifax), Jackson (Newcastle Knights), Platt, Betts (both
Auckland Warriors) captain, Clarke (Sydney City Roosters), Farrell
(Wigan). Substitutes -- Mather (Wigan), Pinkney (Keighley), Cassidy
(Wigan), Joynt (St Helens).
Australia -- Brasher (Sydney Tigers); Wishart (Illawarra), Coyne (St
George), Hill (Manly), Dallas (Sydney Bulldogs); Fittler (Penrith
Panthers, capt), Toovey (Manly); Pay (Sydney Bulldogs), A Johns
(Newcastle Knights), Carroll, Menzies (both Manly), Larson (North
Sydney), Dymock (Sydney Bulldogs). Subs: O'Davis, M Johns (both
Newcastle Knights), Smith (Sydney Bulldogs), Kosef (Manly).

AS we come round to Budget time each year there are a huge number of
submissions made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider
abolishing this tax and that, to reduce taxation generally, and to help
particular disadvantaged groups. This year he is under more political
pressure than ever to deliver a tax cutting Budget. But just what can he
do?
Keen to win back the votes of middle-income families, Kenneth Clarke
must consider what options he has to introduce measures that would be
well received by this group. In addition, he does not want to be seen to
damage business generally, while delivering meaningful tax cuts to the
lower paid would be very popular.
However, his biggest problem is that he has little room to manoeuvre.
Setting out detailed public sector borrowing requirement reductions over
the next few years and trying to deliver significant public expenditure
cuts means he may only be able to announce good intentions for the
coming years rather than real cuts in the short term.
Bearing all this in mind, let's look at some potential vote winners.
Knocking a penny or two off the basic rate of tax is a headline grabber
and would be popular with Mr Clarke's backbenchers while increasing most
families' after-tax income. But it is expensive and if he did this
together with increasing the personal allowance by at least inflation,
it could cost anything up to #5000m. If he cannot get this through
savings in public expenditure he would have to raise taxes elsewhere --
the most likely area would be VAT and national insurance contributions.
So far he has managed to avoid the widespread introduction of national
insurance charges on benefits in kind and this could bring in a
significant amount of money. It would be politically dangerous though as
it would hit right at the heart of those on middle incomes who enjoy
these benefits. Because of this, a charge on the employer only might be
the option chosen.
Another area Mr Clarke could concentrate on is that surrounding
children and working mothers. For instance, he might reintroduce child
tax allowances which were scrapped in the mid seventies when child
benefit was introduced, but this is unlikely as it would be quite costly
overall.
There have been rumours he may seek to tax child benefit. For lower
income families and non-working mothers this would have little effect as
they would not be liable. Most of the tax would be generated from
middle-income families and working mothers. So what could he give in
return? Perhaps a mixture of tax rate reduction and an increase in
personal allowances.
But would it all be bad news for working mothers? If child benefit was
to be taxed, could they expect tax relief for their childcare payments?
Under the present system, the cost of a nursery or nanny is not tax
deductible and where such costs are reimbursed by the employer this
money is taxed.
The Government introduced a form of tax break by ensuring that
workplace nurseries provided and paid for by employers would not give
rise to a tax liability on those using them. But this only went some way
towards addressing the main problem, which is that a significant
proportion of working mothers' after-tax income is going to pay for
childcare.
Some proposal which would give either limited or full tax relief on
such costs would be particularly welcome, although it would be costly to
the Exchequer.
While there is a large lobby pressing for assistance for the housing
market, the options the Chancellor has are limited. It is unlikely,
having already reduced it, that mortgage interest relief will be
extended. Indeed, he could abolish it altogether and use the extra
income raised to fund other tax cuts. Perhaps an increase in the Stamp
Duty threshold to, say, #100,000 could be on the cards. But would this
really help to stimulate the housing market?
A more focused assistance package for first-time buyers has been
called for and, although difficult to legislate for, could provide the
boost the market needs while being relatively cheap for the Chancellor
to deliver.
I was reading the Institute of Directors' submission to the Chancellor
regarding the forthcoming Budget and it was interesting to note it was
not keen for assistance to be given to the housing market. One of its
main recommendations was to leave personal allowances as they are, but
for the Government to demonstrate its commitment to a 20p basic rate of
tax target by incorporating plans for a 1.5p cut in the basic rate in
1997-98 and 1998-99.
If the Chancellor chose to heed this advice, it would mean we could
expect little in the way of income tax adjustments for 1996-97, but it
would give him scope to do something quite radical.
For example, he could abolish capital gains tax or at the very least
announce an exemption on long-term capital gains. He could also continue
the Prime Minister's theme on inheritance tax and announce his intention
to abolish it altogether after the next General Election. After all,
while one of his main business priorities is managing the economy,
perhaps his primary concern for the coming two years is political
survival.

THE marketing departments of the fund management firms from time to
time find themselves trying to catch the attention -- and savings -- of
investors with much the same sort of product. A visitor from Mars might
be tempted to classify investment as a fashion industry -- and of course
it is to the extent that everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon when a
particular geographic or industrial area seems to be doing better than
most.
The present scene is much less concentrated. At one end of the scale
we have the new bond PEPs offering yields comfortably over what you
could obtain on a conservative portfolio of shares just now. Here the
investor is tempted by the promise of relatively high yields from day
one with the apparent safety suggested by such comforting words as
''preference'' and ''bond''.
They are a natural for the tax-free PEPs and September figures from
the unit trusts showed in fact that just over a quarter of that month's
PEP sales were for bond trusts.
The proportion may well rise. With these vehicles the risks are low.
After all, professional managers ought to be able to avoid the
securities of companies in danger, but do bear in mind Barings and
British and Commonwealth. And if interest rates come down their capital
values should even increase, but remember also that if rates go up the
reverse is likely. They are not totally without risk, but the risks are
low and the rewards are acceptable if hardly mind blowing.
At the other end of the scale we have the venture capital trusts which
are even more tax efficient than PEPs and probably safer than many of
the old business expansion schemes. But they invest in very small
companies so investors have to accept a much higher risk in return for
the possibility of a far better return.
The two ends of the risk spectrum are on offer at the same time so
this is not a fashion thing. The double market has, in fact, been
created artificially. It has always been possible for a management
company to start a trust to invest in bonds or in very small companies
and some were created a while ago.
The new series of venture capital offerings now coming up are,
however, mainly a result of tax concessions and, to a lesser extent, to
the Stock Exchange starting the Alternative Investment Market.
The success of corporate bond trusts has also been created
artificially -- by the Government permitting these instruments to be put
into PEPs.
So while both markets have distinct attractions for the different
types of investor for which they have been designed, it seems worthwhile
recalling that they have not sprung up because the likelihood of
interest rates falling sharply has suddenly increased or because small
companies now seem much more likely to succeed. In other words, the
investment prospects have not dramatically improved -- just the tax
position.
If you wanted to be picky about it you could even argue that the pure
investment prospects may not be quite as bright as they have been. The
October survey of fund managers carried out for broker Smith New Court
-- now absorbed by Merril Lynch -- suggested that the professionals had
turned, by a small margin, into net sellers of UK shares -- with
engineering companies a notable exception -- and gilts.
They were still selling Wall Street, which has been the wrong policy
for a long while although it just might be looking a bit more sensible
now, and were bravely buying Japan (on the basis that the worst must be
over and if it isn't the government will do something more to keep the
recovery going).
The promising economies of the Pacific Rim were also being bought as
were, on a smaller but still significant scale, European companies.
The interest in Europe prompted the broker's investment trust analysts
to spotlight the ''very good value'' which they see in European
investment trusts. Looking at them in terms of the ''package'' of shares
plus the fraction of a warrant (usually a fifth) with which they were
originally sold, they suggest investors should take ''a long hard look''
at these trusts.
As well as the two big European privatisation trusts which came from
the Kleinwort and Mercury stables, the analysts like a range of smaller
ones. Predicting that the ratings will narrow, they say these trusts are
on discounts ranging from around 9%, for Abtrust European Index and
Martin Currie European, to between 14% and 18%, for Paribas French,
German Smaller Companies, Foreign &amp; Colonial German, First Ireland, and
Continental Assets which has the biggest discount of all.
On a more adventurous tack, the team at NatWest Securities has been
taking another look at Latin America, visiting the specialist trusts of
Morgan Grenfell and Scudder.
Noting that the search for successful companies with secure markets is
the way to look at the area rather than worrying about macro-economic or
political developments, they come away impressed with the feeling that
''after a traumatic year some bargain hunting among the Latin American
specialists might not go amiss''. These two trusts have recently been
trading at discounts of 11% and 7.5% respectively.
A discount of 9% at a share price of around 93.5p brings a buy rating
from Credit Lyonnais Laing for Mercury World Mining. The broker gave
this trust a sell rating back in May last year when the shares were
standing at a hefty premium, suggesting a switch to Mercury Gold and
General Unit Trust where, of course, there are no discounts or premiums.
But after the dramatic change in rating and the prospect of strong
performance if international investors begin to focus on mining shares,
it has added it to its best buys list.
The broker notes that the fund's managers believe metal prices are
only at the halfway stage in a cyclical upturn and that both the gold
price and the base metal index are, in real terms, below their long-term
average.
Fund manager Invesco has been added to the list of bull stocks in the
Mid-250 index companies drawn up by the strategy team at Smith New
Court. Fund management companies have been in favour recently and
Invesco has been the subject of upgrades in analysts' forecasts. But it
is also among the companies which market men and women believe may
attract a takeover bid.
Among engineers, the team adds Laird to the buy list in anticipation
of a re-rating and puts Weir on the sell list, saying that although it
has an above market price earnings rating and a below average yield, the
flow of news from the company has not been good.

ENGLAND scored 285 for seven on the first day of their historic
four-day match against a South African Invitation XI in Soweto
yesterday. Opening batsmen Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton gave their
side a magnificent start in the first first-class match to be played in
a township.
The stand of 163 was interrupted by a pitch invasion when president
Nelson Mandela arrived unexpectedly to meet the teams.
Slow left-armer Piet Strydom lured Atherton (59) and Stewart (94) into
offering catches in the deep then had Robin Smith stumped on the
leg-side for four on his way to three for 38 from 25 overs.
With England having lost four wickets for 47 runs either side of tea,
John Crawley rebuilt the innings.
But the introduction of Meyrick Pringle with the second new ball
changed the course of the match again, as the Western Province paceman
took the first hat trick of his career to reduce the tourists to 250 for
seven.
Pringle trapped Jack Russell lbw for 11, then struck Mike Watkinson on
the ankle with a full toss next ball to gain another leg before
decision. Mark Ilott was then yorked with the hat-trick ball --
ironically the seventh ball of an over that had included a no-ball.
* THE third day's play in the second Test between India and New
Zealand in Madras was abandoned yesterday because of wet ground
conditions.

WIMBLEDON champion Pete Sampras marched towards the pinnacle of men's
tennis with a straight-sets victory over Jim Courier in the
quarter-finals of the Essen Open in Germany yesterday.
Sampras, who looks certain to dislodge Andre Agassi from the world
No.1 ranking over the next 10 days, beat his fellow-American 6-2, 7-6
after having saved three set points in the second set.
US Open winner Sampras could regain the top spot he lost to Agassi in
April if he wins in Essen and picks up enough points from victories over
leading players.
After Agassi's third-round defeat here by American MaliVai Washington
and his subsequent withdrawal from next week's Paris Open because of
injury, Sampras should be No.1 again by November 6 at the latest.
Sampras broke Courier's serve in the third and fifth games and
clinched the first set with an ace after 34 minutes. Courier looked like
squaring the match as he moved 5-0 ahead in the tie-break but Sampras
saved three set points and clawed his way back to reach match-point at
7-6. He clinched the match at the first attempt.
Washington followed up his victory over Agassi with a 7-5, 6-4 success
against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.
In today's semi-finals, Sampras meets Austrian Thomas Muster, who beat
Spain's Sergi Bruguera 6-4, 7-6 while Washington plays Frenchman Arnaud
Boetsch who beat Dutchman Richard Krajicek 6-4 6-2.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has launched a new Gold Visa card with one
of the lowest introductory interest rates on the market. Until June 30
it will be 1.05% a month (APR 14.5%) -- thereafter a flat rate of 1.3%
(APR 17.9%) will apply. The card is available to those aged 21 and over
earning more than #20,000 a year. There is a #35 initial charge but no
annual fee (normally #35) the following year if you spend #4000 or more.
Benefits include spending limits tailored to individual needs,
purchase protection on a wide range of goods, and access to Homecall, a
24-hour emergency centre for home repairs. Also, when overseas there is
the security of a medical and legal referral service, and up to #100,000
of travel accident insurance cover.
THE Woolwich Building Society has introduced a limited issue,
three-year fixed-rate bond. It will pay a gross annual interest rate of
7.25%, and a gross monthly rate of 7.02%. Minimum investment is #500,
the maximum #500,000. Withdrawals will not be allowed during the term.
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society has launched a 90-day account
paying higher rates than similar accounts offered by the top five
societies. On balances of #100,000 or more it pays 6.75% gross; on
#25,000 or more, 6.50% gross, and on the bottom tier starting at #10,000
it pays 5.75%. Customers can opt to take interest annually or monthly.
GENERAL Accident Direct, which a year ago launched the first
over-the-phone mortgage protection policy, is now offering a choice of
cover. Typical premiums range from #4.25 per #100 of monthly mortgage
repayment. Effective immediately, Protect Direct is available in six
distinctive forms. Homeowners can insure against accident and sickness
separately from job loss. They can choose 60-day or 30-day excess
periods -- or no excess at all. And they can select a 12-month or
18-month benefit period.
SCOTTISH Provident is introducing a new with-profits bond on November
1, with a special extra allocation of 0.5% available until the end of
December. The initial bonus rate has been set at 6.75% with the next
declaration due in January 1997. It is a version of the company's
Capital Investment Bond so, as well as the with-profits fund, clients
can have access to its other unit-linked funds. Minimum investment is
#10,000 with minimum additional investment of #3000. A terminal bonus
may be payable, depending on conditions in the future.
FIDELITY Investments is offering a 1.5% discount on lump sum
investments into its ASEAN or South East Asia trusts, until November 10.
The former invests in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines, while the latter has a wider remit and a significant
portion of its assets in Hong Kong.
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley Building Society is launching a new mortgage for
first-time buyers borrowing 95% of a property's value. Fixed until
December 1, 1996, the interest rate is 1.89% (APR 2%). There are no
conditional insurances and borrowers are given a free standard
valuation. There is a booking fee of #95 and a redemption penalty of six
months interest in the first five years.

<HEADLINE>Hill farmers facing financial hardship. Ayr executive warns of industry exodus</HEADLINE>

MANY families farming in the Scottish hills are receiving income
support and many more who desperately need it are too proud to ask for
it.
This will be highlighted by Scottish NFU officials when they meet with
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and Agriculture Minister Lord Lindsay
next Thursday.
The union aims to impress on the Government the necessity to increase
financial support under the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances
(HLCAs) at the forthcoming hill farming review.
Addressing the issue at the union's Ayr area executive meeting, area
president John Scott from Ballantrae said: ''The current level of HLCAs
are insufficient to stop the exodus of people from the hills and uplands
of Scotland. Payments must be increased to reverse this trend.''
Willie Cuthbertson from Kilmarnock said the whole of the Scottish
farming industry had to back hill farmers. If livestock went off the
hills the knock-on effect would be felt by everyone, he said.
Mr Cuthbertson added: ''Even if it means cutting support from lowland
farms, hill farms must be protected. If not, all we will be left with
will be a barren countryside.''
But Alastair Love of Kilmarnock asked how union leaders would explain
to Mr Forsyth the recent sale of a #50,000 blackface tup if he brought
up this point and other five-figure sales at both Lanark and Newton
Stewart.
''Good luck to them,'' said Mr Scott, adding that in his view this
trade only affected around 20 of the so-called ''top-flight'' breeders.
It didn't represent any significant amount of income in the hills.
Craig Brownlie, an area secretary, pointed out that no-one made a fuss
when arable farmers splashed out #80,000 for a new combine. Quality tups
were the tools of the sheep sector, he said.
Tom Reid from Dalry claimed that very little money changed hands at
the end of the day from the high-priced deals. ''Totally not true,''
said Mr Scott. ''My family has been breeding tups for over a hundred
years and I can assure you all the deals are straight.''
Robert Livesey from Ballantrae said that after buying a tup, sheep men
were left with very little money and the only ones to profit were the
auctioneers.
Area vice-president Adam Train brought some laughter to the
proceedings when he claimed the reason for the high price tup sales was
because farmers took their cheque book to market and left their brains
at home.
Earlier during a debate on the development of the union's
environmental policy, he said other organisations, like Scottish Natural
Heritage, seemed to have little trouble in getting Government money.
He feared the Government was set to ''have a go'' at the HLCAs and
that the union would have to put up a ''hell of a fight'' to retain them
at the current levels. If this could be achieved it would have won a
major battle.

SHARES in Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe materials and footwear group,
lost almost a third of their value, dropping 35p to 93p, after the
company issued a profits warning, writes NICOLA REEVES.
It was floated at 165p in August 1994.
Following the announcement of the full-year results in June, which
showed an increase of 23% in pro forma profits before tax to #13.2m,
market conditions are said to have remained soft.
Since late August, the group said it had experienced uneven demand
across its businesses in its main domestic markets in the UK, France and
the USA. And so its interim results to September 30, due to be published
on December 6, are expected to show ''a material shortfall'' at the
operating level before exceptional items, in comparison with last year's
result. The directors expect to maintain the interim dividend at 2.7p
per share.
Chamberlain said that it no longer expects full-year profits to March
1996 to match the #13.2m made last year.
After the initially satisfactory order levels for autumn and winter
1995, reported in June, late season orders were below budget. This
resulted in a similar sales level for the season as a whole but lower
than expected profitability, predominantly affecting the first half of
the year.
Export sales, together with the new products that have been introduced
are said to be performing well. In the longer term, the company hopes to
benefit from growth in the Far Eastern footwear market and a rising
demand for good quality footwear materials.
Its broker Credit Lyonnais Laing believes that although significant
sales growth will be difficult to achieve, the managmement can continue
to develop export markets and maintain the cost base in line with
business levels.

WEST Midlands-based industrial distribution and precision engineering
company Wyko Group has its eye on the North Sea with the #2.5m
acquisition, announced yesterday, of the privately-owned Aberdeen
Bearing Group (ABG).
Wyko chief executive Richard Johnson said Aberdeen would be the focal
point for his company's Scottish business. He envisages further
investment north of the Border.
ABG distributes bearings and power transmission components through six
branches, four of them in Scotland. It also has a specialist couplings
operation in Yorkshire.
Although it made a #166,000 pre-tax loss last year, it is now trading
profitably. ABG employs 68 people, 22 of them in Aberdeen. Although Wyko
has a much smaller operation in the city, no redundancies are envisaged.
Commenting on the reasons for the acquisition, Mr Johnson said: ''It
strengthens our position in Scotland. The firm also specialises in the
offshore (oil) industry.''
Wyko paid #1.2m in cash, with the remainder of the consideration
satisfied through the issue of shares.

<HEADLINE>Call to relax rural planning rules</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975667344</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANNING regulations designed during the post-war era to preserve
Britain's farmland as a safe source of supply for food are often no
longer relevant and should be modernised, the Rural Forum was told
yesterday at Inverurie.
Henry Graham, agricultural services manager of the Clydesdale Bank,
told delegates: ''It is crucial for the long-term strength of Scotland's
rural economy that we begin to make better and broader use of the
resources of our countryside by increasing the spread of land-based,
wealth creating activities.
''The start for this process must be the pulling down of all the
barriers of the past which were erected to protect our food supply.
''Thanks to improving yields, new technology and modern equipment we
no longer need all these protections.''
Instead, he suggested, it was time for a more relaxed approach to
rural planning restrictions so that existing land resources, many of
which were tied to agriculture, could be used to generate new sources of
employment and income.
''I am not advocating a free-for-all approach to rural planning,
merely the development of attitudes which are in tune with the 1990s,''
he emphasised.
''The fact remains that many of today's planning regulations are
designed to protect the land for agricultural use instead of helping to
identify ways of changing a farming resource into an alternative
business or a related housing/crofting enterprise.
''Planners must have enough vision to allow new settlements to be
created rather than remaining stuck with a policy of only allowing
existing villages to become larger. There is tremendous scope to take
land out of production and create new settlements on farms.''
Agriculture was, always had been and always would be the core around
which rural communities either prospered or declined, he said. Thanks to
two or three good years for the industry in general, that core was
strong with many farmers showing a willingness to invest in new
developments.
''We have the chance to improve and strengthen Scotland's rural
economy and we must not allow the restrictions of the past to prevent us
from grasping the opportunities of the future,'' he said.

WHEN I last visited Robin Veitch's factory in Cumbernauld, back in
1988, he had just broken into the Japanese market and was hoping to
double his sales there the following year.
''In fact, it took us five years to get really worthwhile orders from
Japan,'' he told me this week, reflecting on a persistence which won
Traditional Weatherwear the 1993 Jetro award in the Scottish Council's
annual celebration of export achievement.
Veitch is off to Tokyo again shortly, a member of yet another export
mission. He has been to Japan at least once, sometimes twice, every year
since 1988 and now has a network of around 40 agents and outlets for the
company's Macs, the classic Macintosh rainwear pioneered by Glaswegian
chemical manufacturer Charles Macintosh way back in 1823.
At first, Traditional Weatherwear followed all the conventional wisdom
and signed up with a sole Japanese agent, in Veitch's case Kimbun, a
trading house which also handles Scottish brand names such as Ballantyne
and Johnstons of Elgin. ''I was very lucky to get on their list,'' he
says.
But when he started exhibiting at trade shows in Japan, he quickly
realised that being represented by one agent meant others simply walked
past your stand. Eventually -- and amicably -- that exclusive clause was
dropped and business began to grow.
The handmade quality coats from Cumbernauld retail at up to #1400
apiece in Tokyo's fashion hungry boutiques. But Veitch is curiously
ambivalent about encouraging others to take the plunge into Asia's
booming markets.
''It's considered the in-thing to try to export to the Far East
because the market there is so huge. But they are also hard markets to
crack and the cost to any small business like ours raises questions
about how many of us can really afford it,'' he explains.
There is nothing defeatist in his warning. At peak, in 1993,
Traditional Weatherwear was directly exporting 84% of its total sales.
Last year -- when overall sales jumped 56% and topped #2m for the first
time -- that export percentage dropped to 65%. But a significant slice
of home sales went to UK fashion houses for onward sale overseas.
If Traditional Weatherwear didn't export one way or another, it
wouldn't exist. The Macintosh, it seems, is yet another classic product
without honour in the land which invented it. ''In Britain you buy a
raincoat because it's raining. In Italy, for example, you buy a raincoat
because it's October and you're replacing your winter wardrobe,'' Veitch
reflects.
Italy, France, even the US are far easier markets to tackle for the
novice exporter, he believes. Traditional Weatherwear exhibits at two
trade shows every year in Paris, two in Florence and two in Las Vegas.
France remains the company's number one export market, thanks in no
small measure to a longstanding relationship with fashion house Hermes.
Veitch, who has owned his business since 1974 when he acquired the
assets from the receiver, is typical of hundreds of small business
people trying to make a living at home and overseas by selling the
products of traditional Scottish craft skills.
His experience of life at the sharp end highlights the distance which
persists between daily reality for such firms and the rhetoric of those
employed to oil the wheels of business development.
Take training. Coatmaking is a distinctive (largely male) craft.
Veitch uses videos of his coatmakers at work at trade shows to help sell
the product. But Traditional Weatherwear is the only employer for
coatmakers anywhere in Scotland.
That means, in the bureaucracy that is training today, he can neither
find additional skilled labour nor get any financial help to train new
coatmakers. There was no recession at the Blairlinn factory. Overtime is
a standard part of the working week. But, because of the labour
shortage, there is a rigid production ceiling of 300 coats a week.
He is currently training seven apprentices. But, because his is the
only business of its kind, there can be no SVQ in coatmaking. At one
time, the local LEC thought it might be able to help. But because three
of the apprentices hail from Airdrie, in the next LEC area, that project
came to nought.
Unsurprisingly, Veitch is a little cynical. ''We hear all this stuff
about a business birthrate strategy. But what is needed is a strategy to
help companies like us to grow from employing 20 to employing 60.''
By his own efforts, he has got the headcount to 63, thanks in part to
a more recent diversification into the production of waxed and quited
jackets. That machined production now accounts for around a third of
total sales.
He has other beefs too. The bank which wants to charge #300 just to
discuss the possibility of an overdraft. The whack banks want to take
for managing exchange rate risks. And the damage bigger players can do
to companies like his, selling on the back of traditional Scottish craft
skills.
''I'm often asked where we make our coats,'' he says. The question
comes from potential customers who are noticing that, for example, some
supposedly Scottish knitwear is now sourced in Thailand or Hong Kong.
''We all have a responibility to each other and to this country,'' he
says, ''not to damage our brand heritage.''

NEWS agency and financial information group Reuters reported lower
revenue growth and a weaker new order book in the third quarter.
A small contribution from acquisitions and the cumulative effect of
lower levels of new orders so far in 1995 were blamed for the shortfall.
The second half is expected to produce lower revenue growth than the
first six-month period.
Third-quarter income climbed 15% to #677m taking the nine month total
to #1970m, an increase of 17% on the corresponding period last year.
Stripping out beneficial foreign currency movements, third-quarter
revenues grew by 12%.
Active markets benefited the group's foreign exchange and equity
transaction services. Revenue from transaction products rose by 24%, but
revenue growth for media products was just 6%.
There were strong performances from Reuters' operations in Europe,
Middle East and Africa, where revenues grew by 12% at constant exchange
rates to #369m.
Asia/Pacific revenues advanced by 6% to #124m and revenues in the
Americas by 12%. Information management system sales were strong and
business was particularly good in Eastern Europe.
Chief executive Peter Job said the results were in line with the
company's expectations. However, market conditions are said to remain
uncertain and, as previously stated, are not good enough to ensure
double digit revenue growth next year, while 1997 is expected to mark
the nadir in the company's fortunes.
On the positive side, while the process of banking consolidation is
resulting in equipment cancellations, there is still scope for good new
orders, not least in the emerging Asian markets. Deregulation of
financial markets and an ongoing shift to automated forms of trading are
also positive factors for the group.
Reuters' priority is to maintain the high level of investment
necessary to deliver new products in 1996.
Efforts are also being made to improve operating efficiency.
NatWest Securities analyst Neil Junor recommends taking profits in the
shares which yesterday lost 3p to 556p. Mr Junor notes that the stock
has been trading below its all-time high of 595p and below its high
relative to the FTSE-100 index.
However, he says he would be an active buyer of the shares at 520p.

GLASGOW-based Murray Enterprise Investment Trust, which is not rushing
to switch from general industrial and manufacturing to consumer-related
stocks, was slightly adrift of its benchmark index in the year to
end-September.
Net asset value advanced 8.9% to 134.4p, underperforming the benchmark
FTSE Small Cap Index (ex investment trusts) which rose 9.4%.
Profit warnings from a few companies in which Murray Enterprise is
invested knocked net asset value at the end of the financial year.
Publisher Hodder Headline's share price tumbled after it issued a
warning about its second half, although a portion of this loss has been
recovered this month.
A 14% hike in the final dividend to 1.60p takes the total payout to
2.35p, up 12%. This appears generous in the context of the 5.6% increase
in earnings per share to 2.64p.
Highlighting the Murray Johnstone-run trust's healthy reserves, Paul
Potter, manager of the #32m fund, said: ''We don't anticipate the
economy going off the rails so we were able to make this one-off
catching-up move in terms of the dividend.''
The trust, which targets quoted companies with market capitalisations
of less than #300m, believes the London stock market looks slightly
precarious in the short term. Cash holdings at end-September were
consequently nearly three times as high as a year earlier.
Murray Enterprise's move into consumer areas is proving to be much
slower than it would have anticipated three months ago and the fund will
remain overweight in general industrial and manufacturing, certainly
during the rest of 1995.
Mr Potter said: ''We think the risks within a lot of the consumer
goods areas are still quite high, so we are having to be cautious about
making investments in those areas. There are still so many
disappointments around.''
The trust's largest holding at the year-end was Havelock Europa, the
Dalgety-based store-fitter, which at #1.4m accounted for 4.3% of the
portfolio.

PROPERTY agents Knight Frank Rutley and Jones Lang Wootton are jointly
marketing office space at 280 St Vincent Street, Glasgow, diagonally
opposite the Abbey National building.
Recognising that property space is traditionally measured in square
feet, the agents came up with the idea of covering the building with
some graphic square footprints, complete with square toes and heels, to
attract attention.
The feature has drawn considerable attention but caused some people to
wonder when the surveying profession intends to go through the pain
everyone else has had to endure and change over to metric.
The answer is January 1 1996. From this date, office and industrial
space will have to be advertised in square metres, each of which it
seems is equal to just over 10 square feet.
Heads are being put together at KFR and JLW to decide what to replace
the square feet with come January 1, and I am told that Greg Limb, a JLW
account executive, was not amused when he saw colleagues eyeing him up
and suggesting ''square limbs''!
Lively interest
in things Scots
TOM Wetemans, general director of the Dutch Livestock Commission, will
be a busy man next week when he visits Scotland.
His itinerary will include hosting a table at the annual dinner of the
Scottish Provision Trade Association in Glasgow's Hospitality Inn, where
other guests are likely to see him sporting traditional Scottish evening
wear in the Mackay tartan.
Wetemans wears Highland dress at many functions in his native land,
and enjoys explaining to people that his interest in Scotland dates back
to when he traced his ancestry to a Mackay who emigrated to Holland
several centuries ago. He started a family line which has included a
prime minister of The Netherlands.
In addition to his meeting with cattle breeders and meat traders,
Wetemans will almost certainly take some time off to add to his
collection of traditional Scottish music, which he says proudly is the
largest in his country.
The question has to be asked: are there ANY others?
Exploring the
implications
THE south-west corner of Scotland is the latest area to have to deal
with the possibility of becoming an oil province.
The Stewarty Council of Voluntary Service is holding a two-day forum
on November 4 and 5 in the Station Hotel, Ayr, to discuss the impact of
oil and gas exploration on the area.
A wide range of community representatives will be present at the
forum, including David Tervet, director of the Solway River Purification
Board, Patrick Stewart of the Clyde Fishermen's Association and Chris
Rollie of the RSPB.
Allan Campbell, principal economic research officer of Grampian
Regional Council, will give those attending the benefit of Grampian's
experience.
The forum will also hear from Colin MacDuff-Duncan, operations
managers of Esso Exploration and Production Company, and from Richard
Grant, manager of environment at British Gas Exploration.
There are not many residential places left at the forum, but anyone
interested in going along should call Janice Connelly on 01557 331346.
Serious lack
of humour
I DON'T know if Sir John Shaw, deputy governor of the Bank of
Scotland, meant to do it, but his speech at the Chartered Institute of
Bankers' dinner in Glasgow's Forte Crest Hotel earlier this week
depressed some of his audience.
Sir John was proposing the toast to the Glasgow district of the
Chartered Institute at the dinner and was speaking on the role of the
chartered institute in banking and of the need for education.
Two West of Scotland industrialists who attended told me that his
message was rather downbeat, and both said: ''Thank God for Dougie
Donnelly, he brightened the proceedings up.''
Neither gentleman, it should be said, could recall precisely what Sir
John had said to depress them, but they were able to recount
word-for-word some of the cracks delivered by TV sports presenter
Donnelly, none of which could be repeated in Business Diary.
This perhaps suggests that what they really meant was that Sir John
had a serious message to deliver.
Conference
on the buses
GET On Your Bus will be the rallying cry in the Quality Central Hotel,
Glasgow, on Monday at a conference organised by the Harrison Consultancy
on the role of the bus in public transport.
Douglas Harrison has lined up an impressive array of speakers on this
subject including Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach Holdings, and
Chris George, product marketing manager of W Alexander of Falkirk, the
world's largest builder of double-deck bus bodies.
Martin Higginson, economic adviser to the Confederation for Passenger
Transport, the national representative body for the industry, will also
be addressing the audience of around 90.
Representatives of a number of local authorities, the Scottish Office
and Scottish Enterprise will also be attending.

A SMALL group of leading Scots on the world business scene came to
Glasgow by scheduled train from Gleneagles yesterday on phase one of a
mission to put something back into their native land.
Euan Baird, the Aberdeen-born chairman and CEO of Schlumberger, the
New York-headquartered oil services multinational, rubbed shoulders with
Jackie Stewart, the Geneva-based former world motor racing champion and
ubiquitous man-of-business.
Also to be found in the City Chambers were Sir Ian MacGregor,
Florida-based former chairman of both British Coal and British Steel;
Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, the banking conglomerate;
Sir Denys Henderson, until recently chairman of ICI, now chairman of the
Rank Organisation; and Graham McCallum of the Swire Group.
They were joined by Sir William Stones, now Kelso resident but until
recently managing director of China Light &amp; Power. Sir William, it
transpired, was born in Newcastle, but boasts a Scottish mother. Joining
the group later, back at Gleneagles for dinner, was Sir Adrian Swire,
also of the Swire Group.
They met, at the invitation of Scotland International, to discuss on a
one-to-one basis, the business challenges facing a group of home-based
Scottish business leaders, ranging from George Mathewson of the Royal
Bank to David Michels of Stakis, from Jim McColl of Clyde Blowers to Jim
Hosea of Scottish Pride Holdings.
After lunch they debated the Scotland the Brand initiative with
Tourist Board chief executive Derek Reid and how their homeland might
most productively exploit new communications technology with Ewan Brown
of Noble Grossart.
This morning, back in Gleneagles, there will be a more wide-ranging
debate about Scotland's economic future and what the ex-patriate
community can contribute to it, involving an invited audience from the
Scottish-based corporate elite.
''If nothing more, it's a tremendous opportunity for networking,''
said Sir Charles Fraser, chairman of Scotland International. ''But I
want these guys to become more interested in the future of their home
country.''
Acknowledging the danger that such an encounter could degenerate into
nostalgia and ''home thoughts from abroad'', Sir Charles claimed the
initial signs were much more positive than that.
''These are very able people and there's a huge pool of goodwill out
there in the Scottish diaspora. We've got a few of them back and we want
to build on their enthusiasm. A few Scottish companies are already
becoming more international in their outlook. But not nearly enough
yet.''
Scottish International trawled widely in the ex-patriate business
community and has a clutch of positive letters from prominent players
who could not, for a variety of reasons including family weddings,
participate in this inaugural event.
''We would hope to do it again next year,'' said Sir Charles. But
before it can achieve that, the fledgling Scottish International will
have to secure the funding to assure its own future.

THERE are three pre-requisites if you want to raise serious capital
and create a trailblazing enterprise on a world scale, says this month's
winner of the TrailBlazer's Award. They are an innovative idea, an
identified market and a management team committed to success.
Despite possessing all three, it has taken four nail-biting years for
Coatbridge-based Magnum Power to take off. Now, just one year after its
public flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market, it has rocketed.
Magnum Power is an electronics company leading the world with its
invention of a built-in, uninterruptable power supply unit for computers
(BI-UPS).
For years, computer users feared cuts in power supply and the
consequent loss of data. Even though a stand-alone safety device, the
uninterruptable power supply (UPS), was able to cut in and protect the
computer when lightening struck or the plug was accidentally pulled,
problems arose with surges or shortages as mains power was reconnected.
It was in the late eighties that company founder Vin Lavin started to
consider these problems. An electronics engineer with three decades of
hi-tech experience, one of them as a computer consultant in the US, he
began to think laterally, approaching the power supply unit from a
completely different angle. The result was a unique new device.
The BI-UPS, which fits into the power unit within a computer, is a
cheaper, more compact, logical and reliable solution to the problem of
maintaining a constant source of power. It is also more cost-effective
in terms of electricity as, unlike the UPS, it does not need to be
switched on all the time.
In 1990, Lavin returned to Scotland to develop and refine his BI-UPS.
He identified three potential markets: the higher end of file servers
and serious business PCs for which Magnum would make and supply BI-UPS,
the vast mass-produced PC market, and that which includes fax machines,
video recorders, electronic tills, file servers and so on.
Worldwide, 45 million computers are manufactured each year. It is
forecast this could rise to 62 million in three years. Every one could
have the Magnum BI-UPS chip as a standard component at a cost of,
perhaps, #10 to #15.
Lavin and his finance director, Ian Irvine, were convinced they had a
winning idea for a vast and profitable market, and they had the third
pre-requisite too: an experienced management team utterly committed to
the enterprise. For two years, they had worked without a salary and had
sunk every penny they had into the venture.
Despite all this, 1990-94 was a frustrating period as they attempted
to raise the capital they needed. One institution after another either
refused or offered unpalatable terms. Eventually, they decided to go to
the USM -- the first Scottish electronics company to do so. The
flotation raised #4.5m last summer and a further #2.4m in March.
Now, Magnum has orders from IBM and Apricot and is supplying them with
BI-UPS made in its Ayrshire factory. In the long term, the best profits
lie in supplying around a dozen world-scale manufacturers of power
supply units. The company is talking to a number of them and has
received an enthusiastic response. As a result, Lavin is quietly
confident that, within three to five years, the Magnum BI-UPS will
become the industry standard.
''Despite a slow start, Magnum has gone through a period of rapid
development during the last year and has developed the resources to
exploit the opportunities it now foresees. This is definitely a company
to watch,'' says John Ker, head of entrepreneurial services at Ernst &amp;
Young's Glasgow office.
The award and how to enter
The scheme is a joint initiative of The Herald and Ernst &amp; Young,

* In August 1994 I invested with my wife in two PEPs, #6000 in Save &amp;
Prosper Scot Yields, Income, High Return and Smaller Companies units and
#6000 in Halifax Global Advantage.
It appears to my limited knowledge that I would have been better off
putting the #12,000 into a building society or alternatively paying off
my mortgage, which is an endowment with 10 years to run. I would be
grateful for your advice.
* With hindsight you may be right but 14 months is too short a time to
assess an equity investment and your units have not performed much out
of line with the averages. The value of your holding would have been
affected by the initial charge you paid.
Equity investments do not rise smoothly like money on deposit but in
fits and starts, with occasional backward moves. Historically they have
comfortably out-performed deposits over the long term, meaning at least
five years.
If you did not appreciate the long-term nature of the investments or
their risk nature when you bought them, you would probably feel more
comfortable using the money to repay your mortgage, while keeping the
endowment policy going.
* In a recent article on tax saving, the first suggestion you gave was
to opt, if possible, for an executive pension plan rather than a
personal pension. In several articles in the past year you have stressed
the wide differences in the benefits obtainable from different pension
schemes because of the variation in the level of charges imposed by the
companies managing them.
You have also recommended certain low-cost personal pension schemes,
such as those operated by M&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial. I would be
extremely grateful if you could suggest some similar low-cost executive
pension plans which would be suitable for employees of a small company.
* Executive pension plans are suitable for small groups of directors
or executives and still have advantages over personal pension plans
despite various restrictions that have been imposed in recent years.
In particular, the level of contributions can be higher and the
company can borrow money from the fund. Death cover can also be higher
if required. The technicalities are complex and you will need to consult
a professional adviser. The Foreign &amp; Colonial plan is only applicable
to personal pensions, but M&amp;G has an executive plan.
A recent survey by Money Management magazine concluded that for
regular premiums Abbey Life, Allied Dunbar, Commercial Union, Norwich
Union and Scottish Amicable were the best buys, while for single
premiums Standard Life came out on top.
You should perhaps also consider a small self-administered scheme.
These require more organisation but allow higher funding levels and
greater investment flexibility, as the trustees can manage the fund
themselves. SSASs can also invest in commercial property and lease it
back to the company.
* We would be grateful for your opinion on our financial situation. My
husband recently retired aged 55 although he hopes to do some casual
work sometimes in the future. We live in a house worth about #120,000
and have a mortgage with the Halifax building society with only about
#1000 outstanding.
My husband's pension from his employer is about #20,000 per annum and
we will be able to live on that. Our main investments are: building
society and bank #175,000, PEPs #21,000, investment bonds #30,000,
ScottishPower shares #21,000 and endowment policies maturing over the
next 10 years with a value of about #40,000.
We have been referred to the financial adviser at the Clydesdale Bank
but meanwhile we would like to have your advice as to how we can ensure
a stress-free old age, at least as far as our financial situation is
concerned.
* You should certainly stock up on PEPs bearing in mind that a couple
can put #18,000 per tax year into them, including single company PEPs,
as they are so tax advantageous.
Generally, you can afford to invest more for capital growth, and
accept the greater risk this implies. One of the best vehicles for
people in your situation is investment and unit trusts investing in
equities with a higher than average yield. They have a record of
consistent capital and income growth over the long term. Until you
require the income you can always reinvest it.
Whatever your adviser suggests always ask exactly what the expenses
associated with the investment are and don't forget that straightforward
investment trusts only cost a few per cent to buy.
* In June 1993 I began a monthly PEP savings plan with Ivory &amp; Sime's
ISIS investment trust. Initially I was pleased with the performance of
the Ordinary shares, but the recent performance has been disappointing,
being lower than the price at launch.
I notice that the share price is at a substantial discount (about 25%)
in comparison with the net asset value -- one of the largest in the
sector. Given that the investment policy is the provision of ''a
diversified portfolio of high-quality UK equities with potential for
above average capital growth'', I wondered why this should be the case.
* The market appears to be unduly harsh on ISIS given that its net
asset performance has been satisfactory, showing a 21% rise over the
past year. The large discount reflects City memories of its
disappointing launch and the capital structure. The Ordinary shares do
not receive any income -- it all goes to the convertible annuity shares.
This would justify a larger than average discount but not one as high as
25%.
Ivory &amp; Sime agrees the discount is a ''cause for concern''. The
savings plan in place should have a positive impact and the discount
will eventually be eliminated as the end of the trust's life in 2001
approaches. Assuming your investment is for the long term it is worth
sticking with it.
* I have just received a communication from Southern Electric
recommending me as a shareholder to accept the cash offer from National
Power which values each share at 1010p including a special dividend of
185p. This is part of the proposed takeover of Southern by National
Power and I have to return the form of acceptance by November 3.
However, on page 25 of the 64-page document it also states that if
sufficient acceptances are received National Power intends to apply for
compulsory acquisition of any outstanding Southern shares to which the
offer relates under Sections 428-430 of the Companies Act 1985.
Is this normal practice in takeover bids? Does it mean that I do not
really have a choice but to accept the offer, that there is no way I can
remain a shareholder of Southern, and that I do not have a choice of
converting my present shares into National Power shares after the
takeover?
* Almost all takeover bids have the proviso that if acceptances reach
90% any outstanding shares will be compulsorily acquired. The Companies
Act allows the bidder to do this and it is a sensible arrangement for
all concerned.
It would not be worth anyone's while to remain a small minority
shareholder because the controlling shareholder could effectively ignore
the remaining shareholders and, for example, not pay them any dividends.
For the bidder, the existence of minority shareholders would inhibit
his ability to integrate the business he has acquired and generally add
to the administrative burden as the company acquired would have to
remain a separate entity with annual reports, meetings and so on.
So long as National Power succeeds in getting 90% acceptances, and it
is rare that an agreed bid does not, you have to accept the bid and
cannot remain a shareholder of Southern. However, it first has to be
declared unconditional in all respects, which can only be done if the
Government decides not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
In this bid you cannot opt to receive National Power shares instead of
cash. Often there is a share or partial share alternative to all-cash
terms, but National Power has decided not to offer this because of its
strong financial position. You can always reinvest in another
electricity share if you want.

<HEADLINE>Early cut in interest rates ruled out as the American economy bounces back in third quarter. GDP figures wrongfoot markets</HEADLINE>

FINANCIAL markets on both sides of the Atlantic were taken aback by
official figures showing that the American economy bounced back strongly
in the third quarter to the end of last month.
The strength of activity dealt a blow to lingering hopes of another
cut in US interest rates before the end of the year.
But markets were over the worst when European traders went home for
the weekend. The FTSE-100 share index, at one point nearly 35 points
lower, confined its loss to 21.7 points, but still closed below 3500 at
3497.9.
Wall Street, which fell sharply on Thursday as the Mexican peso took a
beating on foreign exchange markets, was back in positive territory
after being nearly 28 lower in morning trading. The Dow closed 37.93
points ahead at 4741.75.
The Federal Reserve Board, America's central bank, shaved a
quarter-point off US rates in July when there were fears that the
economy was on the brink of recession.
In the event it slowed down to an annualised growth rate of 1.3% in
the second quarter, but promptly picked up again smartly.
In the latest quarter gross domestic product grew by 4.2%, well above
Wall Street expectations of 2.6%. It was the strongest performance by
the American economy since the final quarter of last year when it grew
at 5.1%.
The biggest surprise in the figures was the positive contribution from
government spending which increased at an annualised rate of 3.1% in the
latest quarter.
But Wall Street pundits expect this to be clawed back putting a damper
on growth in subsequent quarters. Stocks made a small positive
contribution against expectations of a fall.
A leading private sector economist, David Sloan, noted that despite
the help GDP got from government spending the strength of the overall
number was broadly based.
''Consumer spending, residential investment, and net exports were all
a little stronger than expected. You had reasonally strong growth with
no inflation at all. It shows a pretty healthy economy.''
Muted inflation indicators accompanying the GDP figures checked the
hostile reaction of financial markets to the headline number.
The price deflator was up just 0.6%, its smallest quarterly gain for
32 years. A 2.1% rise in the fixed-weight index was the smallest for two
years.
The American GDP figures have few implications for UK monetary policy.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, are not expected to sanction any change
in interest rates when they meet on Wednesday.
Figures earlier this week showed that the British economy grew at 0.5%
in the third quarter, the same as in the second. Mounting evidence of an
economic slowdown has forced George to drop earlier demands for a rise
in rates.
If anything, the strength of the bounce-back in the US would be likely
to deter policymakers here from deciding on a rate cut after the Budget
at the end of next month.

Bobby Riggs, tennis star and hustler; born February 25, 1918, died
October 25, 1995
BOBBY Riggs, the former Wimbledon tennis champion who became famous
for his ''battle of the sexes'' tournament with Billie Jean King, died
at his home in suburban San Diego on Wednesday at the age of 77.
He had been ill for a long time with prostate cancer and had recently
had a colostomy operation.
Riggs was ranked No. 1 in the world in 1939 when he won Wimbledon and
the first of his American titles at the US Championships, later known as
the US Open. He was known to the sporting press as ''The Retriever'' for
his extraordinary capacity to return even the most difficult shots. A
master of the lob, he was also agile and fast and would force his
opponents into errors. This was demonstrated at the first professional
world tennis championships in Los Angeles in 1945, when he beat Don
Budge, then considered the most formidable player in the world.
But the sport's greatest hustler catapulted to notoriety in 1973 when
he declared that women belonged in the kitchen and not on the tennis
courts. He challenged Billie Jean King to a duel at the Houston
Astrodome before a record crowd of 30,000 and a TV audience of 50
million.
Riggs, who was 55 when he took on 29-year-old King at the height of
the women's liberation movement, lost the best-of-five match 3-0 in an
event that helped to legitimise women's tennis.
''King was a crusader, doing it for a cause. I was doing it for fun,
love of the game, and the money,'' the hard-gambling Riggs, the son of a
preacher, once said.
Billy Jean King said of her old adversary: ''Bobby Riggs was a true
friend for the last 25 years. His generosity, fighting spirit and hustle
were felt both on and off the court throughout his life. Our 'battle of
the sexes' match helped to advance the game of tennis and women
everywhere. This great champion will be deeply missed.''
Riggs claimed that he won $100,000 in 1939 alone from betting on
himself to win the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at Wimbledon. The
co-star of an ill-fated 1979 tennis movie called Racquet with Bjorn
Borg, Riggs in real life hammed it up on the courts by playing tennis
while carrying a bucket of water, wearing diver's flippers, even on one
occasion having a poodle lashed to each leg.
He was diagnosed eight years ago as having prostate cancer and
established the Bobby Riggs Tennis Museum Foundation in San Diego in
1994 to encourage youngsters to take up the game, and to promote
awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.
Riggs was born in Los Angeles in February, 1918, and began playing
tennis at the age of 12. In addition to his singles titles he won the
Wimbledon doubles and mixed doubles in 1939 and the US mixed doubles in
1940. He was also a member of the US Davis Cup team in 1938 and 1939.
Twice divorced, Riggs is survived by his daughter, Dorothy Marks, and
sons Robert, Larry, Billy, and John, as well as several brothers and
sisters. His long-time companion Lornie Kuhle was at his bedside when he
died.

THE Rev W I G Wilson, churchman and scholar; born March 21, 1912,
Oban, died October 22, 1995, Bozeman, Montana, USA
THE Rev Iain Wilson -- known in his young days as ''Wig'' from his
Christian-name initials -- has died at the age of 83 in Bozeman,
Montana. He had a notable career as an academic and churchman in the US
and also oversaw the reconstruction of church life in the British sector
of Germany after the Second World War, in which he saw service with the
King's Own Scottish Borderers.
Born in Oban, Iain Wilson grew up in Manchester and moved to Edinburgh
at the age of 15 following his father's death. He worked there for five
years for the Sun-Life Assurance Company of Canada before graduating
from Edinburgh University and New College divinity faculty.
He studied in 1937 with Rudolf Bultmann at Marburg University,
Germany, and was ordained in Edinburgh the following year. His first
charge was in Belfast, and he then became a minister in Slamannan.
In September 1939 at the start of the war, he volunteered as a
chaplain in the British Army, serving with the King's Own Scottish
Borderers, and taking part in the Dunkirk evacuation and the Sword Beach
landing on D-Day. He later wrote the first battalion's history of the
war.
Two of his wartime companions remembered him warmly this week. ''He
was a very able, competent, and companionable man,'' said the Very Rev
Dr William Johnstone, then a fellow chaplain. Lt-Colonel Colin Stonor of
York -- at that time a second lieutenant with the first battalion of the
KOSB -- recalls that Wilson joined them in June 1940 and served with
them as battalion chaplain for five years until 1945. ''He was a
delightful, human, caring man,'' said Colonel Stonor, ''as well as being
a cultured scholar and talented writer.''
Wilson was mentioned in despatches. ''A very dedicated man'', in
Colonel Stonor's words, he worked with the first-aid post when the
battalion was in action, helping out with casualties, as well as
visiting troops on the frontline.
At the close of the war he was stationed in northern Germany at Field
Marshal Montgomery's headquarters. Here his fluent German was
instrumental in his secondment to liaise with German churches and
oversee the reconstruction of church life in the British sector. At the
end of 1946 he became secretary of the German desk of the department of
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the World Council of Churches in
Geneva.
Two years later he emigrated to the United States to join his American
wife Madeline -- whom he had married in Edinburgh in 1939 -- and their
children. His first American post was as assistant pastor at the First
Presbyterian Church of Lynchburg, Virginia, his wife's home town. The
following year he became Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at
Davidson College, North Carolina. While there he translated the largest
portion of Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics.
In 1954 he was called to Franklin Street Presbyterian Church in
Baltimore, Maryland, where he served for nine years, and then went to
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Pennsylvania, as Professor of
Homiletics.
After five years he returned to Baltimore to be pastor of Brown
Memorial Presbyterian Church and after retirement taught philosophy at
Towson State University, Maryland, and religion at Villa Julie College.
In 1981 he became pastor of the Community Protestant Church of West
Yellowstone, Montana, retiring in 1985 to live in Bozeman, Montana.
Before falling ill he preached in an interim capacity and taught
classes at Bozeman First Presbyterian Church. He also taught classes for
the Bozeman public schools adult continuing education programme.
MrWilson is survived by his wife Madeline, their children, and
grandchildren.

Viveca Lindfors, actress, born Elsa V. Torstensdotter, born Uppsala,
Sweden, December 29, 1920, died, October 25, 1995
THE Swedish-born actress Viveca Lindfors, who has died in hospital in
her home town of Uppsala, went to Hollywood in 1947 following in the
footsteps of Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, but somehow never quite
achieved their fame. ''I arrived too late to Hollywood,'' she said once.
''When I got there they were not interested in my kind of woman.''
But, truth to tell, she was not all that interested in Hollywood,
preferring to work in the theatre, particularly in the plays of Brecht
and Strindberg. But she did make some 40 films, mainly for the money,
and also appeared frequently on television, winning a best actress Emmy
in 1993 for Life Goes On.
Her films were by and large undistinguished, but she had a strong
personality and with her dark hair -- which turned a striking silver
with age -- and good looks, was always someone to be noticed. In her
first Hollywood film, Night Unto Night made in 1948, her co-star for the
melodrama was Ronald Reagan. It was directed by Don Siegel, who became
her third husband.
She was in Adventures of Don Juan (1948) with Errol Flynn, the 1950
film noir, Dark City, played Mary in King of Kings (1962), the 1961 life
of Christ directed by George Stevens starring Jeffrey Hunter, known in
the trade as I Was a Teenage Jesus, and in Exorcist 111 in 1991, and
last year was in Stargate, the science fiction film starring James
Spader.
An American citizen, she spent most of her life in her adopted country
and, if her film career was less than memorable, her career in the
theatre was far more successful. She made her Broadway debut in 1955 in
Anastasia giving a performance described as electrifying, appeared in
plays by Shakespeare and Tenessee Williams, as well as in her own
feminist one-woman show, I Am a Woman, which she toured round America,
Canada, and Sweden, and studied at the Actors' Theatre.
Her fourth husband, George Tabori, the writer, producer, and director,
worked with her in devising a Brecht anthology called Brecht on Brecht
which she toured round America during the 1960s. In 1971 that marriage,
like its three predecessors, ended in divorce and she did not remarry.
She died while touring Sweden with her own play, In Search of
Strindberg, in which she herself played the controversial author and
artist August Strindberg. She is survived by two sons, one from her
first marriage, one from her third, and a daughter from her second, the
actress, Lena Tabori.

Mary Wickes, actress, born Mary Isabelle Wickenhausen in St Louis
1920, died in hospital in Los Angeles, October 22, 1995
MARY WICKES, who appeared in more than 50 Hollywood films, was one of
that select band of character players who provided style and bite to
offset the performances of the stars.
She was always the plain lady on the sidelines, a librarian, a
receptionist, a telephonist, the heroine's friend, the girl who never
got the boy, a player whose face everyone remembered, although they
could seldom recall the name that went with it.
Her last film seen here was the feminist remake of Little Women in
which she played the formidable Aunt March with splendid assurance,
mellowing as the story went on in a charming fashion.
She appeared in both the Whoopi Goldberg Sister Act films about
singing nuns, playing Sister Lazarus. Among her other films were:
Postcards from the Edge; the Crosby and Kaye musical, White Christmas;
the Doris Day comedy, It Happened to Jane; the Bette Davis film in which
Bette was a ruthless magazine editor who staged a wedding for a special
magazine feature and fell in love, June Bride; and the naval farce
starring Glenn Ford, Don't Go Near the Water.
Her withering look -- she could settle a man's hash at a glance -- was
something of a speciality, and provided the inspiration for the cartoon
villainess in Disney's 101 Dalmatians, Cruella de Vil.
She also appeared in a host of television shows and series, among
which were I Love Lucy, MASH, and Murder She Wrote. She was repeatedly
nominated in the American Comedy Awards, and got an Emmy nomination for
her starring role in Mrs G Goes to College in which her co-stars were
Gertrude Berg and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. In 1980 she appeared in the
Broadway revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! playing Aunt
Eller, her 17th Broadway show.
She appeared on Broadway 27 times during her career and her Great
White Way plays included five written or directed by George S Kaufman --
The Man Who Came to Dinner, Stage Door, Hollywood Pinafore, Park Avenue,
and Town House.
In between films she acted in theatres across America and also had a
flourishing career teaching seminars on comedy acting at the American
Conservatory Theatre, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, and the
College of William and Mary. Washington University awarded her an
honorary Doctor of Arts degree.
She never married, and died at the UCLA Medical Centre from
complications following an operation.

WILLIAM Freddie, an avowed anarchist who introduced surrealism to
Scandinavia and used pornography to express his art, died on Thursday.
He was 86.
Freddie started with a cubist exhibition in Copenhagen in 1929. A year
later, he swung to surrealism, inspired by Salvador Dali, and introduced
the style to Scandinavia.
In 1936, British customs seized Freddie's work as he tried to enter
Britain for an exhibition. The banned items included the surrealistic
bust of a woman with a penis painted across the cheek. It was to become
his best-known work.
Considered pornographic, the bust was also barred from Norway and
Denmark in 1937. He was jailed twice in Denmark.
The Nazi occupation force in Denmark banned Freddie's works, prompting
him to flee to neutral Sweden in 1944. Through the 1960s, his pieces
first were tolerated until fully accepted by the authorities after 1969,
when Denmark legalised pornography.
His less provocative surrealistic paintings now hang in major
international galleries, including New York, Chicago, Tel Aviv, and in
several Swedish museums. In 1974, Freddie became a professor at the
Copenhagen Arts Academy. He was also awarded the French Order of Arts
and Letters.

EMILE Jonassaint, who rose to prominence as Haiti's president during
its recent military dictatorship, died on Tuesday of natural causes,
relatives said. He was 82. The former Haitian Supreme Court justice had
been ill for several days.
Jonassaint was named Haiti's president in May last year by the
military dictators who had seized power in a 1991 coup that sent
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide into exile.
Aristide was returned to power in October last year after negotiations
between military leader Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras and former
American President Jimmy Carter, in which Jonassaint participated.
Jonassaint was considered a puppet of Cedras, who resigned with other
coup leaders following the negotiations.
Jonassaint stepped down with Cedras's resignation but, unlike other
top officials in the military government, remained in the country.
During his five-month presidency Jonassaint oversaw one of the military
state's harshest periods when it invoked a state of emergency and
expelled about 100 UN/Organisation of American States human rights
observers.
Jonassaint, born in the north-western town of Port-de-Paix, also
served as president of the Constitutional Assembly in 1986-87. He was an
ardent believer in voodoo, the Haitian religion that combines elements
of Roman Catholicism with the worship of spirits.

IF a woman's work is never done, it's only because they can't leave
things alone for two minutes. If it's not new curtains, it's new
carpets, or more painting. Men know better. A man's idea of home
improvement is to install cable TV or buy a computer.
Having been absent for two whole weeks, it was inevitable that
something would ''need doing'' when I got back. For some reason it was
deemed essential to move, or throw out, every item of furniture we
possess.
Every last bit of it. I can't really work up any enthusiasm for this
but, as usual, I gave a help with the minimum of fuss, swearing only
three or four times a minute. As the day dragged on she casually pointed
towards a box in the corner. ''I was just going to throw that out, OK?''
Thankfully, I checked what was inside. It was my record collection!
Mind? Of course I bloody minded! Like most people, I bought records only
once adolescence began to wear off. When the light at the end of that
particular developmental tunnel came into view, some part of my brain
realised that there is more to music than that old eight-track cartridge
of Neil Sedaka.
I then had a strange compulsion to buy the sort of records that I
would now denounce as tosh. It's probably just as well I had no money.
I know I hadn't played a single one in three years, but we've been
married longer than that, and I haven't seen her wearing that big white
frilly dress out to the shops. I had to make a stand: a man can't deny
his past. The records stayed.
In celebration, I dug out the turntable and spent an evening listening
to every single record, or would've done if they weren't so dire.
Today's music is crap. This must be true, because it's just as crap as
it was 15 years ago.
My favourite ones were #3.99 ones from Menzies, but each LP had a
message relevant to today. In UB40's first LP, we have proof of how fame
can kill a band. When they were a bit obscure, these guys were at their
best. One hit later, and they develop a sudden desire to wear dark
glasses and record Neil Diamond songs.
In the Human League, we see how fickle youth fashions are. One
Christmas, Phil was a generation's spokesman with a gender-challenging
haircut. By the time the schoolgirl recruits were old enough to vote, he
was seen as an old git, shamelessly living off past glories. Those whom
the Gods want to humiliate, get given gigs on Saturday morning ''kidz''
TV.
I also learned that I was as gullible as today's youngsters, because
there are records here that make me want to throw up. Taking a
dispassionate view, Billy Bragg's first LP is terrible. (''I was 21
years when I wrote this song, I'm 22 now but I won't be for long.'')
When I hear it, though, I don't hear the self-obsessed, simplistic
tuneless whinge, I just feel 19 again.
When Southern Freeez by Freeez limps out of the speakers, the rational
part of my brain tells me that it's time to look out a Sinatra record,
while the rest of my brain is busy remembering how great it was to be 16
in a friend's house on a Saturday night with a six-pack of cheap lager.
I like some of them, but I'm not proud of them. I should make it clear
that I have never, at anytime, fallen for the ''Heavy Metal is an
essential part of growing up'' myth. Heavy metal is for spotty geeks by
other, slightly older, long-haired spotty geeks: it's an illusion of
rebellion for boys too stupid and too indolent to rebel properly.
There were pseudo-intellectual gits at my school who tried to convince
us that the songs had a deeper meaning, as if Love Ya All Da Way was
obviously an earnest tract on the social effects of Thatcherism, rather
than a lust song about (dreamt of) teenage romps.
All modern music is like this. Lyrics to any song written after 1955
are nothing more than musical accompaniment. How often have you found
yourself singing along with the radio, wailing a pale imitation of the
singer? You're lucky if you sing real words, never mind coherent
sentences.
REM are a classic example. Even a post-doctoral semiotics scholar
couldn't fit any meaning to their words; all that stuff about sleeping
sidewinders and sad tomatoes. It doesn't make them bad songs, and it
doesn't stop me buying them, but it does make them pretentious tossers.
The whole house reorganisation quickly became unstuck anyway,
following an outbreak of chickenpox.
Being a deeply unpleasant experience, it's lucky that we get
chickenpox while we're too young to consign it to long-term memory
centres. It's just a shame the same isn't true of adolescence.

It seems the Lottery may be taking more than it gives, while many
potential funding beneficiaries are finding the phrase It Could Be You
does not apply. Carl MacDougall highlights one arts project whose value
speaks for itself
A RECENT economic survey by Channel 4 News suggested that the National
Lottery could be taking as much as #5bn out of the economy. With less
than #1bn going back, the lottery is charged with effectively slowing
economic growth at an equivalent rate of 2p in the pound on income tax.
Such figures usually make me run for cover. When politicians talk
about billions of pounds as an abstraction, my powers of understanding
and perception freeze.
But these figures seemed important. If true, the worst predictions
have been exceeded. The Government can ignore a nation of gamblers
especially if, like smokers and boozers they boost the Exchequer, but if
the gamblers are making off with the money, then it's time to readjust
the system. This Government will find it hard to argue against the
effects of these statistics, other than through its usual method of
ignoring them or producing statistics of its own, proving Disraeli was
right when he said there are three kinds of lies of which statistics is
definitely the worst.
The only comfort is that these figures come at a time when the lottery
is under fire anyway. Proposals to ban scratch cards and limit the
amount of money a winner can take could well be the beginnings of a
backlash.
The National Lottery was created to get the Government out of a
problem they could no longer ignore. Arts spending had little or no
priority. The crisis which arts organisations had long anticipated had
arrived. As usual, Thatcher's resolute fend-for-yourself Philistinism
wavered when her own supporters complained about the venues opera was
being performed in rather than the type of person one had to pass to get
there. Arts organisations had lobbied for long and weary, while bodies
like the Adam Smith Institute fired warning shots across the bows in the
form of proposals to abolish the arts councils and allow arts
organisations the freedom of finding patronage elsewhere.
Ministers for the Arts did not stay in office for any length of time,
so there was little or no continuing policy. Neglect seemed the most
likely cause of demise rather than abandonment or abolition.
The answer, we were told, lay in sponsorship, but what sponsorship
there was generally meant consumer products attaching their names to
awards or one-off events. Such largesse hardly made it easier for a
first novel to be written, nor has any other feasible proposal emerged
to replace the arts councils by providing the patronage artists,
musicians, writers, or performers need in the beginning.
The most heavily publicised lottery handouts to projects such as the
Royal Opera House, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and, more especially,
the Churchill papers, did not always attract the sort of publicity
wanted, which has doubtless promoted the recent charitable donations,
giving rise to charges, of political correctness on the one hand and
giving money to down-and-outs on the other, which exposes a major
weakness: what happens to those projects with little or no publicity
value, whose benefits are barely tangible and their returns hardly
visible? What about the projects that did not make an application for
lottery money because, until recently, it was considered pointless?
We don't have far to look for such Cinderellas. They are mostly
supported by the invisible funders, local authorities, the same people
who underwrite the Edinburgh Festival, Mayfest, and innumerable small
scale arts projects which neither meet the Scottish Arts Council nor the
lottery stipulations, who generally insist a project be established
before it can be considered for funding. But with the local authorities
themselves changing horses, their continued resources are put into
question, if not actual jeopardy.
While arts organisations once again vent their frustrations at being
left in limbo, Michael Forsyth reinvents himself by listening to
everyone except opposing politicians. In the meantime, the Labour party
is consolidating ground well established through its local authority
base. And while it's hardly free from criticism, by far the most
interesting aspect is that it has not always fallen for the temptation
to fund the bigger, more visible projects.
Over the summer, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland George
Robertson addressed two conferences devoted to the arts. The first was
an International Conference on Adult Education and the Arts, organised
by the Arts in Fife, and the second was SALVO, the Scottish Arts Lobby's
AGM. At one the Labour Party was the only political party openly
represented. In both speeches he spoke of the importance of arts funding
at a local level, where it can be most effective.
I have recently finished a two-year stint as Writer In Residence to
the Glasgow South East area, based in Castlemilk Library -- an area
which, along with Westerhailes, Ferguslie Park, and Whitfield, has been
designated in need of attention.
It was important to take the residency forward, to build on the work
done by my predecessor Dilys Rose. Focusing on the writers' group, we
ran a writers' weekend on a programme of readings. The first weekend
featured a forum on publication with people from small magazines and
publishing houses taking questions from the floor; and the second
weekend launched Cutting Teeth, whose fourth issue is presently being
prepared.
The idea was to break away from the small writers' group anthology
which seems to have outlived its usefulness in its present form. Cutting
Teeth is a professionally designed and produced magazine, published in
Castlemilk, which mainly uses work by people from writers' groups across
the country. It would be difficult for any magazine to avoid such
submissions.
There has, of course, been criticism, mainly from people whose work
has been rejected or those who seemed to think the magazine would be
self-selecting. The initial problem was the magazine's success in so far
as we were criticised for featuring writers whose work, it was felt,
could easily have found a home in other publications. The last issue
almost exclusively featured work from writers' groups.
For many, this is the first place where their work will be taken
seriously. There is a simple curiosity which drives people into such
groups, and while there is no general reason as to why they come
initially, the difficulties some have to endure to stay or even to
attend regularly can be overwhelming.
I have known women get out of bed in the middle of the night -- and in
one case hide in a cupboard beneath the stairs -- to write while their
husbands and families are asleep. I have known unemployed men who have
left home every morning and walked to the public library where they've
spent the day writing leaving the daily batch with the librarian for
fear it would be destroyed at home. Both had to fight the feeling, often
underlined by others, that they were wasting their time. Both had to
fight the fact that others felt threatened by their work. If the work
received any recognition, was published, even if the writer was asked to
read in public there were different sorts of pressures. Many want the
past protected.
Under such conditions, I would argue the quality of the work is
unimportant. Work can be improved, and anyone who goes through these
sorts of indignities must be serious about what they do. They may not be
common, but neither are they untypical.
It is difficult to imagine what sort of writing could produce such
hostilities; but I have deliberately started with extreme examples to
highlight the importance such an activity has for many people, reaching
far beyond the scope or intention of any writers' groups. These groups
are simply a starting point, a springboard into the unknown. There are
places where a new writer can experiment and discover, where they can
learn and weigh themselves against others, where many of us received our
first signs of approval and where something, even a scarcely formed
idea, first became a possibility. There is hardly a writer in Scotland
today who has not attended a writers' group of one sort or another.
Some groups sprang from an umbrella organisation and now manage their
own activities; others joined an existing network. Some grew from
further education or adult learning courses. Some began as workshops and
are now affiliated to the Scottish Association of Writers' Groups. Many
were started by writers in residence to a college, university, library,
district or town and then the writer's term expired the groups carried
on, sometimes with another writer, but often on their own.
Many groups develop with the help of a professional writer who acts as
a tutor, either on a regular or irregular basis; others have the service
of a writer in residence; but more often than not, writers' groups meet
and develop on their own, bringing a writer in to judge a competition,
do a reading, look at their work, or, more usually all three.
The emphasis is always on new work, normally on poetry and short
fiction, and on developing the writer's skills, rather than finding a
market for their work or manoeuvring their way into existing markets,
which tends to be the concern of some of the more established groups.
As a result of this movement -- the way it was based and structured
away from a formalised approach, the sort of writers' group who is not
interested in internal competitions, magazine articles, or genre-based
writing -- there began to develop what could have been seen at the time
as a new kind of writer, someone who seemed disinterested in reaching
the established markets. Like every writer, workshop members appeared to
want their work read, but reckoned they were writing for a different
audience. At first, they seemed mainly interested in reaching people
whose experience was similar to their own, and since cheaper printing
had brought publication within the reach of most groups, they set about
producing a few hundred copies of booklets containing their own work,
which were sold locally, mainly to friends and neighbours.
Six years ago, I edited an anthology of poems and stories from such
publications, some of the writers featured are now prize winners and
household names. Despite that, I think it's true to say that the energy
and commitment, the new direction and enthusiasm the work seemed to
promise has not been fulfilled.
The main reason, I believe, is that the anthologies have become
self-selecting, that anyone who turns up and submits material has their
work automatically included. It is largely in an attempt to introduce
critical standards that Cutting Teeth came into being; or maybe it
should be to reintroduce critical standards, for I believe such
standards were there in the beginning. The trend that everyone who turns
up has work included is unfortunate but it's understandable. It has
helped marginalise many writers' groups. I know of some where the
funding body is expected to produce an anthology of work at the end of
each session, and that anthology is self-selecting. A few hundred copies
are produced and nothing happens. It all seems a waste of time and money
compared to the promise the early anthologies seemed to present. Many
appear to have disintegrated into another form of vanity publishing.
Cost is obviously a major consideration in any publication, and the
costs of Cutting Teeth are considerable for an individual project,
though relatively small in relation to the total arts budget. They
mostly cover printing and distribution; and most of the subsidiary costs
are covered by general arts office expenses. It is an area which is
constantly being scrutinised and where small savings are easily made,
but the larger costs are more or less static. The problems are the same
as they have always been. Advertising is difficult to attract because of
the restricted readership and the selling price has to be kept low to
make the magazine accessible. Without support from the Scottish Arts
Council the end seems inevitable.
With arts associations fighting to maintain what they have established
many would find such a commitment difficult. The attractions of the
group anthology are obvious compared to something like Cutting Teeth.
Even the simple fact that it is a quality publication, based in a local
community, that it gives a positive message about that community and
carries the message to others who maybe experiencing similar
transitional difficulties, can only be sustained for so long.
Whether Cutting Teeth succeeds or not, a statement has been made. We
have shown it is possible to produce a visually exciting quality
literary magazine, to overcome the prejudices and problems such a
venture entails and to attract a range of excellent submissions from a
wide variety of writers. I believe it is possible to carry this idea
still further. Albeit that the idea is barely original and would have
been stillborn were it not for the Glasgow District Council South East
Area Arts Office commitment. I'm not suggesting it is the only way
forward but it is an attempt.
Anyone looking at these publications must agree that the excitement
that greeted the early group anthologies is there. We are seeing
difficult subjects treated with strength, confidence, and skill. We are
seeing risks being taken and have found some extraordinary individual
talent. Little of it makes comfortable reading but there is energy and
ability and I believe these pages show the skills that are lying unused.
We found them because we asked to see them. I believe they are there for
anyone who looks.
Perhaps these things can only be found in a magazine like this, but
what Cutting Teeth has proved and will continue to prove, is that this
is not a flash in the pan. I believe there are a number of ways foward
from here. Individual publications by writers whose work is attracting
attention in other quarters is an obvious route. But that, or any other
way has a better chance of success if there is a magazine base to build
on.
This a movement like any other. There have been difficulties and they
will continue. It is often hard to find a way through the maze of
contradictions, self-interest, and whining. It takes resolution and
commitment. Yet the rewards are wonderful.
I believe it is important to keep trying, to build and hopefully
succeed where others have failed. If Cutting Teeth falters, the point
has been made and we will only have failed if nothing takes our place.
It could be argued that a healthy literary scene produces many small
magazines, shooting stars who flair into being, continue for half a
dozen, 10 or 12 issues then disappear, to be replaced by something
similar, generated from a different perpective.
Writers' groups and their publications are giving voice to those who
have been silent, whose lives have been made invisible and whose
experiences have been marginalised. They do not deserve special
privileges, anymore than they deserve to be ignored. Nor should special
pleadings be made on their behalf. In the main, the work is good enough
to stand on its own and we ignore it at our peril.

NO wonder the feminists loathe the Tories. The permanent scowl on
their faces breaks into a contortion whenever they peruse the Guardian
and see, between articles on ''PMT in the post-modern novel'' and
''Child rearing and the development of the coal industry'', a photograph
of the pert, pretty, personable Gillian Shephard.
How their fetid, unwashed hair, coagulated against their skull, must
shake with despair. Their black fingernails must bite with rage into the
newspaper. And they must stamp their Doc Martens with the ferocity of a
Flamenco dancer on Speed.
It is understandable. Mrs Shephard holds not one but two jobs as the
Secretary of State for Education and Employment. No affirmative action
needed for her. No women-only lists. No wingeing. No victim of male
chauvinism she.
Also, she has a full social and family life, is not beaten up by her
husband, and still has time to shop for feminine clothes: floral skirts,
frilly tops, and pastel jackets.
This may all be bad enough but what really sticks in the feminist craw
is that she is a shrewdie. During eminently sensible Cabinet discussions
on how to crack down on bogus asylum seekers she injected a note of
compassion.
If it was left to employers to root out these charlatans, she argued,
it might mean a reluctance by bosses to take on genuine coloured
immigrants. Her intervention was timely and potent and the Government,
rightly, decided that only crooked employers, those who employ people
knowing they are here unlawfully and therefore pay sweatshop wages, will
be punished.
How could she? Aren't all Tories racist? Was this not a race card
being played to win the election? Think how difficult it is going to be
now for all those nice Algerian terrorists, misunderstood Nigerian
gangsters, and poorly potty-trained Sri Lankan hitmen to find a home.
Nevertheless, it is going to be difficult from now on to brand Mrs
Shephard as part of a neo-Nazi clique although Labour and the Liberals
are gearing up to do just that to John Major. Mind you, he looks like
one. The bowl-shaped haircut, those thick glasses, the quotes from Mein
Kampf: ''A land of warm beer with summer shadows breaking across the
cricket square.'' Very Third Reich.
The American Republican P J O'Rourke, a veteran campaigner against
trendies, is one who is often called a Nazi. He shrugs off this
name-calling.
''I don't let it bother me for one simple reason,'' he says. ''No-one
has ever had a fantasy about being tied to a bed and sexually ravished
by someone dressed as a liberal.''
This may be a bit too strong for Mr Major and certainly so for the
polite Mrs Shephard. But she will have to be on her mettle in the next
few weeks when she announces, along with every leftie's hate figure,
Michael Forsyth, the introduction of a test scheme for nursery vouchers.
Doubtless the Fuhrer had just a scheme in mind for the Hitler Youth and
Mussolini is said to have been keen on it to teach toddler Italians how
not to splash red sauce from their pasta on their nice new black
uniforms.
Fortunately, she has been let off the hook by Labour's education
spokesman David Blunkett, who today has come up with his own madcap
scheme. (Isn't it wonderful that as soon as Labour flashes up their
policies we can see how barmy they are? This one is a cracker.)
The nice Mr Blunkett has deemed that all children over seven years of
age will do half an hour's homework each night. Those in secondaries --
I am not sure if that includes opt-out schools like his leader and other
senior Labour politicians send their kids to -- will do 90 minutes.
Now this is very commendable. He is concerned that children are
watching too much television, so each evening homework will be the hors
d'oeuvre before the nightly diet of sex and violence after the 9pm
''watershed''.
These are ''hors d'oeuvres which must be obeyed'' under Labour. It
will be interesting how this will be achieved. Will there be a Prep
Police who will swoop randomly on unsuspecting families throughout the
land to check that the night's trigonometry has been completed? Will
there be a special section of the Serious Crime Squad who will quiz
youngsters on exactly what they mean by saying Zambia is a
copper-producer? Or will it be left to the parents?
''Now listen, Bobby, I want you to have read all of Antigone before me
and yer dad get back from the pub.''
And does the homework apply to all subjects? ''Ma, I'm gonna do extra
tonight. I've got Suzie in ma room to help me with a sex education
project.''
Interestingly, Labour rarely mention the quality of teaching in our
schools. They bleet on about sacked teachers, they moan about above
average-size classes, and they complain about under-funding. Now they
propose dumping the problem on parents.
Having supported every crackpot scheme from comprehensive schools to
the abolition of any form of corporal punishment, they now wonder why
there is so much indiscipline and indolence in the classroom.
Dr Rhodes Boyson in his autobiography Speaking My Mind recalls how he
was made headmaster of an unruly London East End school. The teachers
were at a loss as to how to cope and the children did what they wanted.
Exam results were, as a consequence, terrible. He first introduced
discipline including the stopping of smoking.
''The women staff drew the line at visiting the girls' lavatories,''
he remembers. ''I therefore instructed my caretaking staff to obtain
lengths of fire hose and connect these to the water hydrants. When at
morning break smoke began billowing out of the girls' roofless
lavatories, the caretakers and duty staff opened the hydrants and the
hoses were put over the girls' lavatory doors, which were immediately
locked from the outside.
''Great screams were then heard and those in the playground stopped
and called out that there were girls inside.
''I replied: 'Of course there are, but the lavatories were on fire and
we are saving them.' After five minutes the hydrants were turned off,
the girls released were totally drenched and needed new hairstyles. No
one smoked there again.''
Now that's what I call teaching.

RADIO Three's Composer of the Week was Luciano Berio. Graham Fawcett
presented a celebration of this extraordinary artist, who reached his
70th birthday this week, and did a splendid job. Berio was the one whose
musical modernism I have always found inspirational in its lyrical
gravity; its fascination with the human voice, its virtuosity bridging
past and future in its relentless never heartless exploration.
He braves all the areas of musical form, he goes electronic with ease,
he transcribes Beatles songs, and he is a true folklorist, his archivism
replacing dust with vibrant humanist memory.
But that doesn't mean I don't like Classic FM which as far as I'm
aware doesn't deal much with what is deemed to be difficult. It's true I
have turned off Strauss a few times when listening to this station (but
then I've always found Strauss a turn-off) but there is a kind of
snobbery against FM which I think is, well, dodgy. A ''Naice'' sort of
would-be classy muzak it is judged to be. A sort of nouveau on the
classical block, but in spite of its cringe factors, (and which station
is free of those?) I think that one of the most despicable aspects of
our class-ridden culture is that which tells us that any attempt to make
art popular is by definition aspirant-suburban.
Sure they play the Four Seasons too much and they do a sort of better
(couldn't be worse) Simon Bates-ish version of How We Met at the Met.
But I don't always want to listen to a dissection of various recordings
of the same piece. Play, not replay is sometimes OK.
On R4 Adrian Mourby continues to delight us with his Whatever Happened
To? series which cynically and hilariously uses characters from
children's fiction to make radio-spitting images of our crazy times.
Whatever Happened to the Seven Dwarves? Well, the tabloids got to them.
It seemed so perfect, at first, the Snow White girl and the Prince who
needed a bride. She was cute, he brought her back from the seeming dead,
and they became the perfect royal couple.
In a world of crumbling family values, in which devious single parents
living in horrible housing schemes were milking the state of their money
and romance, there appeared a fairy-tale marriage. He was worldly, his
mother was rich, and the virgin was goodlooking. Summertime.
But her past was not what it said on her very short CV. Snowy had been
living with seven short, old men. None of whom were invited to the
wedding. Hurt wasn't the word. And the greater hurt was the appalling
treatment meted out by ungentlemanly press.
Bad enough that the happy ending stuff was in serious need of
counselling, therapy, or a more respectful attitude from the flag-waving
minions. Bad enough that the perfect couple were now going around in
separate glass carriages, waving in a drowning kind of way. But the old
guys were beginning to freak. Devastated and misunderstood, their
cottage trashed by palace guards, they had no way of knowing how Snowy
was doing, and the nice reporter with his large foot in the door seemed
to be on their side . . .
All countries need good people on their side and Nadiner Gordimer has
right and good writing on her side for South Africa. In Continent Adrift
(R4) she movingly described a Jo'burg where the expected, the utterly
understandable resentment of recently freed people was not the dominant
atmosphere. She described a black man bumping into her on the street and
saying ''Sorry, grandmother'', because she had grey hair. The voice of a
woman loving her country and acutely grateful for the outcome of its
history.

Theatre
HOWARD Barker writes hard, in the fullest sense of the word, plays. In
his self-proclaimed quest to produce theatre which gives the audience
''rights of interpretation,'' he sets himself up to defy ''Clarity and
Realism,'' calling for a ''Theatre of Catastrophe'' which strives for
''The dissolution of coherent meaning'' and insists on ''complexity and
pain.''
This I know thanks not only to the extensive programme notes
accompanying the RSAMD's production (directed by Hugh Hodgart and
performed by final-year students) but also to the experience of
struggling through two uninterrupted hours of Barker's wilfully dense,
ambiguous and disruptive theatrical language.
It's an ambitious and worthy project, carried off with professionalism
by all concerned, and an apt and laudible choice by the academy.
Barker's script demands ensemble playing and provides
more-than-challenging opportunities for trainee performers to grapple
with textual analysis and interpretation in the plays use of fragmented
characterisation and role playing.
Indeed, the self-consciously theatrical structure of the play: a party
of doomed French aristocrats perform their version of the death of
Christ in the midst of the revolution; seems wickedly appropriate as a
showcase for an emerging generation of actors.

IN a dimly lit cavernous room the ''bitch mother'' and berated ''she
wolf'' is public enemy No 1. Here among a smouldering emotional soup of
infanticide, murder, and betrayal, the forces of Fate are wreaked by a
family treading and trading upon the murky waters of
mother-father-daughter relationships.
Another ho-hum rerun of Dynasty? Most certainly not. This superb work
in progress by the fledgling Diva Company certainly carries echoes of
contemporary relevance, exploring as it does an eternal and taboo
triangle.
Taking the core plot of Aeschylus' ancient Greek tragedy The Orestian
Trilogy, the company have devised a multi-faceted performance which
jumps blindly into the future where confrontation with the dead and
guilty is inevitably going to resurrect ancient passions long since put
to murderous sleep.
Clytemnestra, the murderous wife and estranged mother, has no rights
and can do no right in the eyes of daughter Elektra, who mistakenly
believes mother murdered father Agamemnon for the hormonal reason of a
new bedmate.
Under the direction of Caroline Hall, the production is a perfectly
and beautifully constructed whole that subtly blends Ross Campbell's
edgy piano score, the atmospheric uneasiness evoked by the lighting and
of course Marisa Zanotti's choreography.
Nowhere is this deployed better than via the pawn daughter Elektra,
who must constantly steel her conscience and feelings against the
opposing wills of her battling parents.

THE BT Scottish Ensemble like to offer programmes which contain
unusual juxtapositions, and this opening concert of their winter season
was no exception. They kept the most familiar work, Dvorak's Serenade
for Strings, until last, and gave a poised account of it. Their playing
has grown more refined, and the ensemble cohesion more disciplined,
under the direction of Clio Gould.
The programme lacked a genuinely challenging work to give it weight.
Janacek's Suite for String Orchestra is uneven in its inspiration,
though they played it confidently and expressively even where the music
was neither.
Grieg's two Elegiac Melodies were entirely typical of that composer,
but they are minor works, and the Viola Concerto by Telemann sandwiched
in between, while also given an assured performance with Philip Dukes as
soloist, did not emerge with impact.
Michael Nyman's Trysting Fields, drawn from his music for Peter
Greenaway's film, Drowning by Numbers, completed a handful of rather
strange bedfellows.
The ensemble explored the lyrical, melodic aspects of Nyman's music
over the rhythmic elements, an emphasis which yielded pleasing results,
while also creating a sense of continuity with the overt lyricism of the
works around it.
It was a cleverly constructed programme which offered contrast and a
unifying thread, but one which lacked a central focus.

IN the time since NDT2 were last in Scotland, the company has changed
and yet stayed, thrillingly, the same. Changed, because a new group of
young dancers have come into the ranks but remaining, none the less,
very much up to the established mark of technical panache and stage
presence.
They proved so assured, in fact, that one tended to overlook the
taxing complexity of much of the choreography, not least in stuff like
Obarzanek's Petrol-head Lover, the thrashingly hectic work that rounded
off the programme and found the company's stamina apparently
undiminished by what had gone before!
Un Ballo -- choreographed by NDT's artistic director, Jiri Kylian as a
kind of tribute to the exuberance and sensitivity of the dancers in this
youth wing -- sets the tone for the whole programme.
The movement shimmers with exact detail: sharp, angular arms that have
an air of courtly mannerism about them, peek-a-boo sauciness in the
lifting high of skirts to veil glances, sudden flurries of swift
footwork drumming against the stately flow of the Pavane.
Paul Lightfoot's Solitaire -- takes the shifting ground of
relationships a stage further. And though there are occasional echoes of
Kylian there is a fine individuality in his portrayal of out-of-kilter
emotions, the imbalance of love unrequited or love over zealous wittily
emphasised by the near naked man, suspended overhead, like some stymied
cupid. Throughout the entire programme the dancers radiate a marvellous,
crisp energy, an intelligent reading of the movement, all without any
''look-at-me'' histrionics.
They are such an engaging group of talented young people that it would
be pleasant to watch them dance some of the flaccid bonbons that very
often pass for repertoire elsewhere One more performance tonight --
worth travelling to the enterprising MacBob for what is an absolute
treat.

IS Sarastro good or evil? The question clearly did not greatly bother
Mozart when he composed The Magic Flute, but it greatly bothers ethical
modern opera directors unable to accept the contradictions in the high
priest's character.
Sarastro's personality is certainly what motivates Nicholas
Broadhurst's production for Music Theatre London, enabling last night's
performance -- the first of two at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre -- to
rise above some glaring deficiencies and to turn itself into a deeply
disturbing interpretation of a work usually treated either as a
pantomime or a piece of masonic symbolism.
There is not much pantomime in this modern-dress performance, though
Papageno, as played by Andrew C Wadsworth with faintly Brechtian
overtones, gets his sardonic quota of laughs. Most of the action,
however, revolves round the fanaticism of Sarastro and his female
obverse, the Queen of Night, though on this occasion darkness seems
distinctly preferable to light.
When Sarastro, from the start, is portrayed as a sinister, smiling
villain out of the world of James Bond, quietly watching his adversaries
through a slit in the scenery, you wonder how Broadhurst will bring
Mozart's opera to a conventionally happy ending. I would not dream of
divulging the shock tactics with which he avoids doing so, but if the
effect is un-Mozartian it is on its own terms thoroughly convincing.
So though the singing for the most part veers between the inadequate
and the execrable, and though Mozart's orchestra is reduced to a
hideously amplified octet conducted by Tony Britten, the performance
packs an undeniably powerful punch. Thomasin Trezise's chaste (and
ultimately zombied) Pamina and Gaynor Miles's impressively accurate
Queen of Night are both worth hearing, but it is Tim Hardy's smooth
Sarastro, in his smart suit and tie, that will linger in the memory.

IN an inspired piece of programming, the MacRobert follows up last
week's performance of Victor Ullman's opera The Emperor of Atlantis with
a new play about the Czech composer's final years in the Jewish ghetto
of Terezin where he wrote that last, and for many years lost, work.
Written by Sonja Lyndon and performed by Paines Plough, now under the
artistic directorship of Penny Ciniewicz, The Strange Passenger dwells
on the bitter irony that the Nazi drive towards the final solution
brought together many of the world's leading composers and musicians.
Torn between the political instinct to rebel and the artistic instinct
to create, Ullman (played by an excellent Andrew Normington) and many
like him, followed his muse.
Lyndon observes that same curious phenomenon which causes the arts to
flourish in Sarajevo or, as in Wertenbaker's Our Country's Good, on an
Australian convict ship, but she also moves the debate on by looking at
the ability of the artist, and in particular the male artist, to detach
himself from the abhorrence of his immediate surroundings while creating
a work of beauty.
The women, meanwhile, support, nurture, starve, and suffer. The
playwright treds an ever intriguing course that both celebrate's
Ullman's creative drive and condemns his pathetic self-interest. The
debate is never resolved and probably never can be.
Pacily directed on a grim suitcase-laden set with a compelling
five-strong company (including an ever-present cello accompaniment), The
Strange Passenger is a tough, intelligent and passionate drama that
underplays the obvious horror of the situation -- you know how it ends
-- to explore a far more subtle line about human nature.

JAYMEE Bowen, the 11-year-old girl suffering from a rare form of
leukemia, yesterday took time off from hospital treatment to go
shopping.
The former Child B, who has been staying at the private Portland
Hospital in London for adjustment to her drug regime, said she wanted to
buy a pair of shoes.
It was the second day in succession she had been out shopping,
although she looked tired and a little downcast.
Her father David said Jaymee was planning to sue the NHS for a
substantial sum after a health authority refused to foot the bill for
experimental treatment.
A court order preventing the media naming Jaymee was lifted earlier
this week to allow Mr Bowen to raise funds for further treatment for his
daughter.
Mr Bowen, 32, from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, said Cambridge and
Huntingdon Health Authority was paying #200 a month towards the costs of
his daughter's treatment at the private hospital.
However, he said a minimum of #400 was needed to ensure that Jaymee
could visit the hospital twice a month for checks.
Solicitors are examining who was responsible for Jaymee's treatment at
the hands of the NHS.
The money given by an anonymous benefactor for Jaymee's private
pioneering treatment has now run out.
Mr Bowen said: ''This is the most difficult time in my entire life. I
really hope I will never have to go through with it again. But if I have
to, I will.''

THE star is the one with his name above the title, the one without
whom nothing happens, the centre of gravity. Cracker (ITV, Sunday and
Monday) rolled onto the screen leaving no doubt at all that Robbie
Coltrane, inhabiting a part as big as any of his suits, is the actor on
whom all depends.
It isn't just the face, simultaneously fat and feral, with its
repertoire of semaphoric tics and grins, nor yet the arias Jimmy
McGovern calls dialogue, like arm-wrestling with metaphors. Coltrane --
''A few grubby stains to get off my soul. . . and it won't be a
two-minute job with a damp sponge'' -- has taken a lease on the role,
staked out a site in the emotional squalor of Fitz's mind, and called it
home.
It isn't a new conceit to imagine a shrink whose interior life is like
Monday morning on the Somme; neither is it innovative to notice that in
the midst of death there is life. Constructing a piece around the
contrived symmetry of two pairs of brothers and calling it Brotherly
Love (with a psychiatrist and a man of the cloth involved we were
spoiled for spoiled priests) left slim pickings to chance. But it
worked.
Mostly it worked because McGovern, as ever, refused to look beyond the
fundamentals of blood, sex, love and hate. In this final series (future
'specials'' notwithstanding) Fitz experienced the death of his mother,
the birth of a son, and a prickly, guilt-ridden reunion with his
brother. Just to be going on with, you understand.
Meanwhile, prostitutes were dying bloody, obscene deaths. A priest and
his pervert sibling were in the frame. And DS Beck (Lorcan Cranitch,
creepily brilliant) was going to pieces and dragging DS Penhaligon
(Geraldine Somerville, the woman in the iron mask) into the pit of his
self-loathing.
As though one spin on the fraternal theme were not enough, McGovern
even dared to show us Beck flipping out because the widow of his old
partner (Beck blames himself, doesn't he?) had taken up with the dead
man's brother.
It was too much -- but could Cracker really work with less? That said,
this reviewer is probably alone in finding the actual writing less
brilliant than it is supposed to be. This probably says something about
the average run of TV drama, but there were few exchanges here that did
not involve standard issue cliches -- and even ''raw emotion'' is a
cliche, don't forget.
It was best when it was simple, when the actors were left to fill the
spaces all good drama should allow. Thus, for my money, Coltrane's most
revealing scene was a halting eulogy at his mother's funeral, a nervous
brush with nostalgia, a misremembered memory of childhood. The emotion
-- all that professional articulacy defeated -- couldn't have been in
the script.
Hence the name above the title.
Back in the good-old bad-old days, football players were
simultaneously stars and bit actors, artists and artisans. Treated like
dirt they toiled in the mud, adored by millions whose own lives were
just that small, crucial bit worse.
Kicking and Screaming (BBC2, Monday), admirably narrated by James
Bolam, reached the Golden Age, and those golden, yeoman names which
sound now like small haulage firms in gloomy mill towns -- Lawton and
Mannion, Finney and Lofthouse, Shackleton and Matthews. Old men from
another age, and old men, moreover, who knew it.
''There wasn't tactics at Newcastle when I was there,'' said
Shackleton, like a Renaissance painter being asked to explain pop
videos.
''Training?'' Lawton asked. ''We watched the dogs.'' Meanwhile,
winningly lugubrious, Bolam noted that in the 1930s one or two
''secretary/managers learned the value of coaching''.
As with Football Fussball Voetbal (BBC2, Sunday), a series devoted to
European competition with just a whiff of trainspotter about it, this
sudden interest in the game's prehistory can probably be ascribed to the
School of Nick Hornby. Thirty and 40-somethings who have persuaded
themselves that a weekly dose of grim, functional sport has meaning have
made the game intellectually respectable. This will probably be the
death of it.
Meanwhile Kicking and Screaming, with its heaving, steaming crowds and
grinning, vibrant young men (in the thirties good health itself had
social cachet) recalls another world both worse and better than ours.
People knew their place -- the maximum wage kept players in theirs --
but they knew they wanted out of it. There never was, and is never is, a
golden age.
Nice Work: Thank You and Goodbye (BBC2, Tuesday), the first of four,
told of how people learn their place in the caring nineties. It
recounted (for why bother to explain?) tales of lives destroyed by
employers who would probably value people as commodities if only they
could find a way to assess their resale value. Instead, they sack them,
mainly because it's cheaper than a bullet in the back of the head.
For some of the innocents featured here execution would probably have
been kinder. The shock, the destruction of self, the uncomprehending
pain of those who had just been liquidated, was nothing new. But the
similarity between the companies involved and the most refined
totalitarian regimes was striking.
This was Stalinism in action, arbitrary, efficiently callous,
illogical, utterly self-interested. It was one thing to ask yourself
about the people who attend courses -- and jolly affairs they seemed --
on how to sack colleagues, quite another to contemplate the goons who
run them.
You could say, of course, that this is how the working class have
always been treated so why worry if, in this age of perpetual
insecurity, the middle classes are being given a taste of their own
medicine? It's a fair point, sort of, but even nice suburbanites deserve
better than Hollyoaks (C4, Monday). Blind comatose gerbils with learning
difficulties deserve better than Hollyoaks.
If Phil Redmond's new soap is Britain's answer to Beverley Hills 90210
someone forgot the question. This is the worst, execrable in execution,
culpable in its patronising ignorance of the young folk at which it is
aimed, and not even remotely funny. Kill it now, before it destroys us
all.
Finally, while the world raves over Saint Delia's pedestrian Winter
Collection (BBC2, Wednesday), and hoots at Jilly Goolden flogging duff
plonk on Food and Drink (BBC2, Tuesday) let it be noted that neither
gets within swilling and spitting distance of Jancis Robinson's Wine
Course (BBC2, Friday).
She's cool, she's funny, and she actually is an expert. What's more
her films, even last night's shots of California's Merlot factories,
look beautiful. What more, short of drawing a cork, could you ask for?

THE Prime Minister let his anger show yesterday after being forced by
a small group of rebel right-wingers to abandon the Government's family
law reforms which would have given people living together the same
rights as married couples in cases of domestic violence.
Mr Major insisted that the Tory Party remained the party of the
family, despite what was an unexpected and embarrassing setback, which
produced a last-minute dilution of a radical piece of legislation that
had progressed through all its parliamentary stages without apparent
opposition.
On Thursday, the Government was forced to accept demands from
traditionalist Tory back benchers who opposed provisions of the Family
Homes and Domestic Violence Bill prepared by the Lord Chancellor, Lord
Mackay of Clashfern.
These would give women living with a violent man the same rights as
married women in obtaining an eviction order, even if the man owned the
house and the woman had no financial stake in it.
The MPs also demanded that the Government drop the Divorce Bill
planned for the next parliamentary session and due to be announced in
the Queen's Speech next month, because they claim it would make divorce
easier by reducing from two years to one the time needed to obtain a
''no fault'' divorce.
At least 100 MPs are said to be unhappy with the divorce changes, and
some Cabinet sources say that the Bill, which Lord Mackay predicted
might ''come a cropper'', now stands only a 50-50 chance of surviving.
However, the Cabinet agreed to postpone the third reading of the
Domestic Violence Bill for a week's consultations, while MPs will be
given a free vote on the Divorce Bill.
Although neither Bill would apply in Scotland, the Government's
climbdown emphasises the extent to which it is prepared to go in order
to mollify its right wing.
An evidently frustrated Mr Major said the Domestic Violence Bill had
passed through the Lords and the Commons without attracting controversy.
''I don't think anyone expected there to be any controversy. There
hasn't been. It has been almost through the House of Commons and the
House of Lords without any controversy being discovered,'' he said.
He rejected suggestions that Lord Mackay had failed to anticipate the
reaction of right-wing MPs. The Lord Chancellor met the group on
Thursday and was said to be shaken by the strength of their opposition.
''Well if the Lord Chancellor misjudged the mood, so did everyone else
when it went through the House of Commons and the Lords earlier. To lay
this at the door of the Lord Chancellor, who is one of the most
civilised, decent and humane men I know, is not accurate,'' Mr Major
said.
Speaking in Cumbria, he added: ''If there was a misjudgment, it wasn't
simply the Lord Chancellor. It must have been the Law Commission who
proposed the Bill, it must have been everyone who examined the Bill when
it went through the Commons and the Lords, up until the last minute.''
Mr Major said the Tories were committed to ''shoring up the
institution of marriage'' -- ''We have always been the party of the
family, always have been, always will be.''
Asked if the Government was having a complete rethink, he said: '''We
are examining the concerns, and until we have examined the concerns, we
don't know what the position will actually be on the Bill.''

A HEAD teacher who gagged a chatterbox pupil with sticky tape has been
put on ''probation'' by the General Teaching Council.
The council's disciplinary committee branded his action as
''professionally disreputable and foolish''.
However, it left the door open for 46-year-old headmaster Alex
Christie to go back to the classroom by deferring judgment for a year.
The career of the head of a primary school in the Falkirk area now
hinges on a decision by his employers, Central Regional Council.
He is expected to appear before a disciplinary hearing by the
council's education chiefs, who have been waiting for the verdict from
the GTC.
Mr Ivor Sutherland, registrar of the General Teaching Council for
Scotland, said yesterday: ''Disciplinary committee members came to the
view that what he had done was professionally disreputable and foolish
but that it did not warrant the ultimate sanction -- striking off.''
Mr Christie was fined #350 in June after pleading guilty to assault at
Falkirk Sheriff Court.     The court heard that the teacher taped a
10-year-old boy's mouth as a joke after he kept talking instead of
getting on with his school work.

<TEXT>
INSURERS yesterday rejected a #3m compensation claim from 200 Shetland
islanders who say their asbestos roofs were ruined by wind-blown oil
from the Braer tanker wreck almost three years ago.
The move makes it likely that remaining claims totalling more than
#15m will end up in court.
The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, which has already
paid out more than #46m for Europe's most expensive tanker disaster,
said there was ''no evidence'' that oil from the Braer made asbestos
sheets and slates crack and curl.
Claimants' organiser Sheila Fowlie said: ''I'm totally disgusted. It's
just so unfair to put the onus on the victims to prove they've been
affected when it's obvious what happened.
''How come roofs sprayed by the Braer oil in the south-west of
Shetland were affected but nowhere else in the islands was?'' she asked.
Local councillor Willie Tait (Dunrossness North) said: ''I'm shocked.
It should all have been settled by now. I thought the idea of a
compensation fund was that nobody would be worse off. Now there's going
to be hundreds of people worse off. The fund are just washing their
hands of the whole thing. I'll be dead by the time it's settled.''
Mr Mans Jacobson, director of the compensation fund, said last night:
''Similar damage was found on asbestos roofs elsewhere in Shetland. I
cannot explain the concentration around the Sumburgh area.''
He said the consultant engineers' research had been ''very, very
thorough'', which was why it had taken so long to respond to the claims.

MOIRA Cherrie's letter raises important questions about the nature and
work of the Church, and why it seems to be losing out today (October
18).
I believe this is because we are not fulfilling our commission as we
should, which is to preach the gospel -- to present Jesus Christ as a
person, as Saviour and Lord, and to call men and women to turn from
their sins and put their trust in him for forgiveness and salvation.
We are more concerned to solve people's problems than to lead them to
faith in Jesus.
A number of years ago I read a piece by the great Welsh preacher Dr
Martyn Lloyd James in which he contended that our Churches' commitment
even in pastoral work is first to help people to become Christians since
if a person is not a Christian we cannot give them spiritual help.
At the time I thought he was wrong. Now I believe he is right.

I AM sorry that the church in Tighnabruaich is now closed, but I do
not blame our minister, Mr Barclay (October 16).
Church architects surveyed two churches with a view to closing one of
them. They decided that Kames Church was the better building, and was
also in the centre of the largest population and it was therefore the
one to be retained.
I expect it is always the same when a church closes. I am glad to say
that there is a good attendance on Sundays but, of course, it could be
better.

DAVID McLennan writes about Glasgow District Council's proposal to
create a rubbish tip on Cathkin Braes (October 21).
Inverclyde District Council has just finished filling Craigmuschat
quarry in the centre of Gourock which is now steadily producing methane
gas and other noxious gases, which will continue for many years to come.
Hydrogen sulphate leachate (rotten eggs smell) is also produced and
has to be dealt with. The problem of smells persists in the area.
Is it not time that all rubbish be treated and processed in a
technological way rather than dumping and thus avoid these environmental
problems?
At Inverkip there is a redundant power station. This could be
converted to a refuse treatment plant, where metals, plastics, etc,
could be recovered, the remainder composted, the methane gas produced to
provide power, and the final inert compost returned to the land.
The plant could take a large proportion of the refuse generated in the
central belt of Scotland and could be transported by barge to the
existing jetty at Inverkip. Since sewage sludge will no longer be dumped
off Arran and will require to be incinerated, the plant could also deal
with this.
Recycling of waste is the only sensible method of dealing with our
refuse. We must stop burying our countryside in rubbish.
Perhaps ScottishPower can make a start at Inverkip and produce some
''brass from muck''.

I WAS horrified to read that Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow
Development Agency are contributing many thousands of pounds to fund a
business and leisure centre in Glasgow for the exclusive use of the
homosexual community -- ''the biggest and most exciting gay centre in
Britain'' (October 17).
What an achievement for the city of Glasgow whose motto is ''Let
Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word''. The second part not
often quoted and has obviously been forgotten by the city fathers.
Why should public money be used to encourage and promote a deviant
lifestyle? The Bible is clear in its attitude to those who lead such a
life. The way of life is to be condemned utterly as going against
everything that is morally correct, but there is always the chance that
these people can be rehabilitated and so perhaps the money would be
better spent towards that end, after the style of Alcoholics Anonymous.

THE report concerning the allowances (or are they salaries?) to be
paid to the three Labour Party officials on the new South Lanarkshire
Council is only one of a number of similar cases which have emerged
since the elections in May (October 23).
Why does Labour, with a majority of over 50 in a council of 74, need a
Whips' organisation in the first place? Surely, so early in the piece,
it cannot be expecting that many defections.
It may be, of course, that some of the Labour councillors are not
confirmed adherents of New Labour, so defections and disagreements are a
real possibility. This could also be part of the explanation behind the
appointment of some 48 of the Labour group to the various committees. Is
the Shadow Cabinet any bigger?
Secondly, why should the taxpayer foot the bill for such a large
Labour organisation? Surely one Whip would have been enough. It has been
suggested they are needed to ensure all councillors follow the Labour
manifesto for South Lanarkshire.
I don't remember seeing a Labour manifesto, but I may be wrong. My
impression was that Labour fought the election on the basis of its
opposition to the Conservative Government at Westminster and had little
to say about local government.
It is the third question which is most important. If this is the way
Labour behaves at local level what can we expect should it ever
establish an assembly in Edinburgh?
Ruth Wishart was right to express her fears that an assembly might
become a safe haven for former councillors. If it ever should, then an
additional 3p in the pound income tax is probably the least we can
expect.

I'M GLAD that Deirdre Campbell enjoyed her trip on the little Cromarty
Firth car-ferry (October 23), but I'm afraid this vessel is not a
turntable ferry of the type unique to Scotland and described in my
article on the history of Kyleakin crossing (October 14).
I've seen a picture of this boat (Ferries of Scotland, Ferry
Publications, 1994) and it's plainly a small two-car bow-loading craft
of similar design -- though in miniature -- to the six-car Small Island
Class ferries built by Caledonian MacBrayne in the seventies.
These six-car vessels, seven of which still sail for CalMac,
incorporate a circular deck turntable, in the plating of the fixed
car-deck, on which to birl cars round and save them reversing. (That's
the theory; they're seldom used.)
I suspect this was the facility of which Ms Campbell took advantage.
On the classic Highland turntable ferries (like the 1957 Lochalsh,
plainly illustrating my piece) the whole vehicle deck -- ramps, rails,
the works -- revolved on a bearing, allowing side-loading off a concrete
slipway.
The Glenachulish (1969) at Kylerhea is certainly the last turntable
ferry in passenger service in Scotland.
A friend recently saw one other in its original design at Lochaline, a
former Corran ferry -- probably the Lochaber (1974) apparently used in
fishfarm work.

I WISH to clarify the reasoning behind Strathclyde Regional Council's
decision to contribute funding towards the establishment of the Glasgow
Gay and Lesbian Centre (October 17).
While prompted to do so by your correspondent, Mr J P K Garthwaite, I
do not wish to address what appears to form the basis of his objection,
ie, the argument about the definition of ''deviant'' behaviour and this
council's alleged promotion of such activity.
I would emphasis that the council's Equal Opportunities Policy seeks
to enable minority groups to provide services to the communities which
reflect the specific needs of their members.
The Gay and Lesbian Centre was given a grant to promote the health and
welfare of gay men and lesbians by providing a helpline, counselling
services, and a drop-in facility. The centre will provide these services
to the members, their friends, and families within an environment of
security and confidentiality.
In this decision the council has acted in accordance with criteria
which governs standard grant allocations to a number of minority groups
which form part of our rich, and varied, Scottish culture.

I HAVE just read with incredulity of the stance of Highland Regional
Council over the proposed special area of conservation designation of
the Moray Firth to protect dolphins.
In particular the comments of the convener, Duncan McPherson, that
designation would have ''an inhibiting view of inward investment'',
reveal an outdated, blinkered view which does not allow him to see past
trying to attract the conventional and often polluting industries to the
Cromarty Firth. They also reveal a lack of understanding of the purpose
of SACs -- the designation allows for economic development, provided the
high quality of the environment is maintained.
If Councillor McPherson cannot see a way to use the immense potential
of SAC designation for attracting the right kind of businesses to the
Moray Firth, then he is no longer fit to represent the best interests of
the people of the area and should make way for someone more
positive-thinking.
Perhaps if the proposed designation had been for dinosaurs, rather
than dolphins, Councillor McPherson would have felt safe.

IN Appointments and Education (October 24) the post of principal
teacher of technical education, a relatively small department teaching
relatively small numbers of pupils, is advertised in Johnstone High at
#25,812, whereas the post of principal teacher of English, a relatively
large department teaching relatively large numbers of pupils, is
advertised in Linwood High at #23,532, a difference of well over #2000.
How come?

WHILE I agree with your review that the Dunoon Jazz Festival has
confirmed itself as a festival of serious stature, it has also become
clear to myself and other visitors that there was no warm welcome for
those dropping into the town and the festival (October 16).
Tickets were pitched as saver tickets daily and for the weekend and
only a few, a very few, gigs were cash at the door.
Thus those who perhaps combined a day and overnight trip to the town
to combine the countryside and jazz were met with very limited options
as to what they could see without paying for the day ticket, eg #18.
Indeed some ambiguity in the programme led some to the door of a gig
on Sunday believing admission was possible at #3.

<HEADLINE>MP tells of new inquiry on Venables allegation</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRADE and Industry Department officials are conducting fresh
investigations into an allegation against England football manager Terry
Venables, the Commons was told yesterday.
Labour MP Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), a former adviser to Arsenal, said
during a debate on sport that the DTI's investigation division was
looking at whether Mr Venables ''may have committed an offence contrary
to Section 47 of the Financial Services Act 1986''.
The inquiries centred on allegations that he ''may have made a
misleading, false or deceptive statement in an offer document'', she
said.
''I understand there are other things that are being looked into and
there may be some developments on that very soon.''
A DTI spokeswoman refused to confirm or deny Miss Hoey's claim.
Miss Hoey warned that allegations of ''backhanders'' in football may
have got too big for the football authorities to deal with alone.
She protested that a two-year Premier League investigation into
allegations of bribes and wrongdoing involving the transfer of Teddy
Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham in 1992 had still not
produced a report.
''We are getting to the stage where there may have to be acceptance
that this is much too big and much too cosy for football itself to
investigate.''
Miss Hoey said that Mr Venables, former Tottenham manager, had not
been cleared by the Premier League Commission's inquiry into the
Sheringham affair.
She said new evidence had come to light in the Daily Telegraph last
month which suggested ''the invoice which was involved in this transfer
might not have been the only invoice''.
Flourishing copies of the invoices involved, she said: ''Obviously
somebody somewhere was trying to launder money out of Tottenham.''
She said the new evidence was ''very serious'' and added: ''All of
those involved in this from day one have known there has been a lot more
around -- there's a lot more to come, there is more going to come.''
The Premier League Commission may have to accept they had not got the
powers to get to the bottom of the issue.
She said: ''At the same time, I understand -- and I don't think there
is a secret about this although it may not have been public knowledge
before -- at this very time the DTI investigation division is at this
very moment looking into an allegation that Terry Venables may have
committed an offence contrary to section 47 of the Financial Services
Act 1986 in that he may have made a misleading, false or deceptive
statement in an offer document.''
Miss Hoey said: ''This leaves a big question mark over who is running
football at the moment.''
In a statement issued by his solicitor Mr Nick Trainer, Mr Venables
said last night: ''Kate Hoey's persistent and cowardly use of
parliamentary privilege to rehash old and tired allegations against me
is objectionable .
''It demeans her both in its partisan nature and its lack of accuracy.
The source of her material is questionable.
''I am totally unaware of the alleged DTI investigation to which she
refers. Either it is untrue or it is yet another chapter in a sorry saga
of the DTI leaking information to the prejudice of those involved.
''I believe the invoices to which she refers have been forged in an
attempt to discredit me and Kate Hoey has naively accepted them at face
value.
''It was me who, immediately following the Telegraph article, demanded
of the Premier League inquiry that the invoices referred to should be
investigated.
''Either Kate Hoey does not realise this or has chosen to ignore it.
She has certainly never consulted me on the subject.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday announced plans to set up
a new-style Scottish Economic Council with more influence and a stronger
advisory role in the nation's affairs.
However his proposals to create the new body with ''more teeth'' to
advise Mr Forsyth and his team on all aspects of Scottish life
immediately came under fire.
Trade union and political leaders attacked the plan, which they
claimed Mr Forsyth had boasted was his secret weapon against
constitutional change.
Under Mr Forsyth's proposals, announced in Edinburgh yesterday, he
would reconstitute the Scottish Economic Council, appoint the new
members himself and make sure they meet on a more regular basis,
possibly about six times a year.
Cash will be set aside to help create a secretariat to help out the
group which is likely to include leading businessmen, local councillors,
educationists and trade union leaders.
Mr Forsyth said they would debate a wide range of subjects including
everything from the budget available for Scotland to pressures on the
fishing industry, health, the economy and the transport network.
At present 30 people are members of the SEC, 12 of whom attended its
last meeting in its present form in Edinburgh yesterday.
Included in the SEC membership list are Mr Fraser Morrision, chairman
of the Morrison Construction Group; Glasgow District Council leader Jean
McFadden; Scottish and Newcastle chief executive Brian Stewart, Mr
Campbell Christie, general secretary of the STUC, and Professor J
Maxwell Irvine, principal of Aberdeen University.
It is unclear how many of the existing group will be asked to join the
new organisation. Mr Christie, who had initially suggested that the SEC
be given more power, was on holiday in Cyprus and unavailable to
comment.
However, earlier this month he said although he would be comfortable
serving on an SEC with a broader remit he did not believe it would be a
substitute for a democratic Scottish parliament.
Mr Forsyth said he hoped the new organisation, which has yet to be
given a name, would ''make things pretty uncomfortable'' for Ministers.
He defended the fact that he will appoint all the members, and stated:
''People will be appointed by me and that was the unanimous view of the
council at yesterday's meeting and they will be appointed for what they
have got to contribute.
''I see the plan as a way of improving the government of Scotland. It
is a way of turning a body which the members feel has not been as useful
as it might have been and which has met on an irregular and ad hoc basis
into something which can help improve the quality of life in Scotland.
''It is one small step in a number of steps which we will take to
improve the government of Scotland.''
He said he hopes the new organisation would hold its first meeting in
January.
After yesterday's meeting of the SEC in Edinburgh Mr Dan Wright, chief
executive of Albion Automotive Limited of Glasgow, a member of the
present SEC, supported Mr Forsyth's plans.
Mr Wright said it gave those involved in industry and commerce a forum
to put their ideas to the Scottish Office.
However the plans last night received strong criticism from all
quarters. Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the STUC,
described the plans as a ''pretty empty vessel'' and would only be Mr
Forsyth's ''echo chamber.''
Mr Speirs added: ''If this 'new' SEC advises Mr Forsyth to scrap tolls
on the Skye bridge, end subsidies to the HCI in Clydebank hospital in
Clydebank, invest in the electrification of the East Coast line to
Aberdeen, would he take their advice? To ask the question is to answer
it.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson described the move as
offering a 'fraudulent figleaf' to the people of Scotland.''Giving
powers back to local councils and beefing up old quangos is not real
devolution. It is a con trick.''
The SNP's chief executive, Mr Mike Russell said: ''Only a few months
ago Michael Forsyth was boasting that the Scottish Economic Council was
his secret weapon in the Tories' increasingly desperate resistance to
constitutional change but these proposals are more of a damp squib.
''What Scotland needs is not a revamped quango but a real parliament
with real powers.''
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats described Mr
Forsyth's move was ''Michael's mouse.''
''The real question is whether Michael Forsyth is genuinely interested
in receiving advice on a wide range of subjects or if it is merely a
publicity gimmick.''
* SCOTTISH Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch yesterday urged 100
Lothian businessmen to think about the cost of devolution.
Speaking at a Scottish Enterprise lunch in Edinburgh, Mr Kynoch said
the business world should not leave it to the politicians to decide on
Scotland's constitutional future.
He claimed that ''tremendous years of growth'' in Scotland could be
adversely affected by devolution and so there was a need for debate in
the business community.

THE American consulate in Edinburgh, which was being considered for
closure by the US State Department, has won a stay of execution, it was
learned last night.
Mr John Burgess, press attache at the American Embassy in London, said
the US Congress had decided to defer a decision on the closure until a
foreign affairs budget -- which would show the costs involved -- was
presented at a future date.
''Congress would like to keep it open if they can but we won't know
the answer to that question for some time,'' he said.
Mr Burgess said Congress had decided to close 12 consulates in a
number of countries and Edinburgh was among four which were being kept
open meantime.
News of the decision was greeted with delight last night by
campaigners who have been pressing for the consulate to remain open.
Councillor Eric Milligan, convener of Lothian Regional Council, who
enlisted the support of former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush,
said he was pleased that ''good sense has prevailed''.
If the question of closing the consulate arose again, there would be
vigorous opposition, he said.

ONE of my most prized possessions is an old 78rpm disc made of metal.
It contains one of the most memorable broadcasts made by the Radio
Padre, Ronald Selby Wright, during the Blitz.
It concerned a boy from the Canongate, Jimmie Dalgleish, whom he had
met wearing sodden plimsoles while he was setting up a youth club during
his student days. The plight of his poverty moved Wright to what he
later called a Damascus Road experience. The vocation to the ministry he
felt at that time eventually led to his role as the Radio Padre.
During the Blitz, Jimmie Dalgleish, by now in the uniform of a
sergeant, took part in one of the Radio Padre broadcasts. As he left the
studio he waved to his mentor ''Goodnight, sir, I'll see you in the
morning!'' Minutes later he came across a burning building and while
helping the rescuers in their task was killed by a bomb.
The Radio Padre came to the microphone the next day with a heavy
heart, and quoted those words ''Goodnight, Sir, I'll see you in the
morning'' not as an epitaph but a benediction from another world.
Reading them here in print does not do justice to the moving way in
which he turned his own grief into a comfort for those listening.
One of the Padre's secrets was that he never lost his delight and
belief in the visionary potential of youth, right to the end of his life
on Tuesday. Although their politics and personalities were very
different, it was a quality he shared with Wendy Wood, the Scottish
patriot, whose funeral I had the privilege of conducting. She once told
me that her secret of longevity and vitality was summed up as ''Faith,
hope, love, and lettuce''. Faith in God, hope for independence for her
country, love of humanity -- and a green salad every day.
I often thought that Wendy was very like my Aunt Louisa who died this
week at the age of 96, still at the height of her mental powers. They
looked rather alike, shared a penchant for green salads (in Louisa's
case the elixir included codliver oil and garlic capsules), and for
patriotism. In my aunt's case she had the luxury of double patriotism --
for her native Scotland which she left in 1926 for Canada, whose
passport she carried with pride until her dying day. Both were feisty
ladies, inclined equally to being mystical or plain thrawn. Ironically,
despite their support for Home Rule for Scotland, both were born in
England.
Louisa Macneill Dewar was born on Trafalgar Day 1899 and was looked
after by my grandmother from the age of eight while her widowed mother
fulfilled the role of district nurse and midwife in the Carse of Gowrie.
The tempestuous young woman sublimated her rebellious nature in long
walks up the Kings Seat, a hill to the east of Perth, but eventually she
took off for Canada where, despite arriving without proper papers, she
bluffed her way past a friendly immigration official in Montreal. She
got a job as a nanny, but within the year she had joined the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce in the accounts office where she rose to the role of
the dragon with the heart of gold.
She never married but once sued a ''pathetic specimen'' for breach of
promise. However, she did once join the Communist Party which, in the
political turmoil of the thirties, was running the most exciting
lectures in town. When she and her pal found out that the reds were
attempting to engineer a dock strike in Montreal they realised their new
friends were not exactly nice people to know, especially while employed
at the Chamber of Commerce. But how to get their names off the red
register?
During her lunch our Louisa arrived at the Communist Party office,
showed her card, and asked to look up the list of members. When she was
handed it, she made a bolt for the door and eliminated the incriminating
evidence.
In 1960 she attempted to retire to rented rooms in Scotland but her
restless spirit was drawn back to Montreal for a further eight years
working in Catholic charities. She eventually retired in her seventies
to the same Victorian mansion in West Ferry and spent her time keeping
both tenants and landlord in line, writing airmail letters to the
various branches of the family tree she had traced back to 1745, and
snipping out cuttings from newspapers.
A free spirit in matters of religion, she nevertheless had a strong
faith which came to the fore when six weeks ago she needed surgery. Ten
years ago she had bounced back after a malignant tumour was removed from
her intestine, but this time it was not to be. As soon as she realised
this, she faced death with courage and serenity which was inspiring for
all who were around her. She was adamant that there was to be no
funeral. Her body was donated for medical research.
In losing her, I have not only lost a dear friend, but my last
tangible hold on the nineteeth century. Those of us who were born long
after the era prior to the Great War when patriotism and youth were not
strangers to one another can learn much from those who embodied its
values.
My record of the Radio Padre, my autographed autobiography of Wendy
Wood, my letters and photographs of Louisa are all grist to that mill.
But even greater is the faith which all three retained to the end of
their days, in the ability of youth to change the world for the better.
In jaded middle age, it is a timely reminder not from the past, but of
the way things ought to be.

REYKJAVIK: Flags flew at half mast all over Iceland yesterday after an
avalanche killed 20 people in the north-western fishing village of
Flateyri.
Two 60-man teams who had searched through the night found the last of
the missing -- a one-year-old girl whose family perished in Thursday's
snowslide.
This is the second time this year that the 265,000 Icelanders have
been united in shock. The nearby village of Sudavik lost 14 inhabitants
in January to an avalanche.
In a country where they joke that everyone is a relative, a friend, or
a friend of a friend to everyone else, the tragedy has become a national
catastrophe. ''We Icelanders all lack for words as we again face the
consequences of a cruel natural disaster,'' President Vigdis
Finnbogadottir said on television.--Reuter.

What appears as affectionate nibbling of the neck could be more than
an interesting overture, warns MARY BRENNAN as she finds the kind of
spirited music that enthusiasts will have no trouble getting their teeth
into.
DARKNESS laps the edges of the brightly lit building. Suddenly, it
moves. Becomes a black, cloaked figure with unnaturally white face and
full red lips. Out of the shadows a girl, in trailing crimson velvet
appears -- like some wraith out of Bram Stoker's imagination. In her
hand she holds two tickets for the concert hall . . .
Danse Macabre, Night on a Bare Mountain, The Sorcerer's Apprentice,
and other appropriately fiendish music are on the bill of the City of
Glasgow Philharmonic's Hallowe'en Concert, and the local branch of the
Vampyre Society intend being part of tomorrow night's audience. No need,
however, to secrete garlic about your person, just in case. These fans
of Dracula and all myths vampiric are thirsty for culture, not blood.
The society's connection with the orchestra lies in the number 474.
Not, perhaps, one of the all-time mystic, conjuring numbers but it
signifies that Terry Johns -- principal french horn with the Phil -- is
a card-carrying member of the Vampyre Society. Drac -- the nickname
stuck to his tall, lean frame when he was younger -- has a well-informed
passion for Stoker's story and for the films that have sometimes taken
Dracula's name in vein.
When the orchestra board -- of which he is currently a member was
mulling over ways of making concerts livelier, more inviting to the
general public, it struck them as natural to link the October date to a
Hallowe'en theme.
After which, it seemed sensible for Johns to alert the society, most
of whom are willing to slip into something suitably Gothick if the
occasion beckons.
In a way both organisations share a similar aim: the challenging of
preconceptions. You could probably add into that, the furtherance of fun
and conviviality.
Johns explains that when the Glasgow Philharmonic Orchestra looked at
the whole business of concertgoing, they reckoned that the formality of
it all was getting between people and the music. Something had to be
done to puncture the lead balloon of protocol.
One highly successful device was having conductor Iain Sutherland talk
about the pieces in the programme. Simply filling in some of the
background, colouring it with anecdotal detail, has, it's felt, helped
defuse the aura of intellectual snobbery that can hover, sniffily, over
a concert audience.
Doing away with the penguin suits, too, has been a big plus. ''It's
all to do with showing the human face of the orchestra,'' says Johns.
''Compared to other orchestras -- and I won't go into any names -- we
have a really good time playing together. And we want that to come over
to the audience. We want them to enjoy the music as much as we do. So
it's more than likely that, for the Hallowe'en concert, people will
dress up a bit, enter into the spirit of things.''
And part of that spirit lies, squarely, with the choice of music.
Whether or not the devil really does have all the best tunes, its
certain that some of the most vivid, mind-tingling music has been
inspired by demonic themes.
Much of it -- like The Sorcerer's Apprentice -- has acquired a blanket
familiarity thanks to Disney and television advertising. But more often
than not, says Johns, it's not played as it should be. People don't get
the full menace of it.
''It should be One! One! One!'' A long finger stabs the air
forcefully. ''But conductors aren't keen to be seen pointing at the
orchestra in such an ugly, aggressive way.'' He grins genially. ''So
they tend to do it in one-two-three'' -- he wafts a hand in illustration
-- ''and it softens it.'' The grin turns somewhat rueful.
Alongside the expected, better-known pieces, the programme offers a
few imaginative surprises. Like Ian Whyte's ballet suite, Donald O' The
Burthens, a Faustian tale about a Scottish piper, choreographed (so I
discovered) by none other than Leonid Massine for Sadler's Wells ballet
in 1951 but undanced for decades now.
Just running through the agenda of funeral marches and haunted airs
has Nicola Bull -- a Glasgow member of the Vampyre Society -- pouring
out praise for the Phil's initiative. ''It's really great to find a
whole programme of classical music that reflects our interests. And for
us, it's a different way of celebrating Hallowe'en. It's probably the
most cultural thing we've done.
''Other years it might be a party, or an outing -- the society is
really good at organising trips, I went to Romania with them -- but this
is something that's happening for the public that we can take part in.
And yes, we will be dressing up -- that's a big part of what the society
is about, and it's one of the reasons I joined. I just loved the
clothes, the imagery, and the fantasy of it.''
A quick glance through copies of the society's quarterly magazine, The
Velvet Vampyre confirms that for a good many members, the clothes are
crucial. As Tina Rath, the magazine's review editor, puts it: ''Sex,
death, and fancy costume'' are essential clues as to why vampirism and
vampires have such a hold on the public's imagination.
At the same time, there are members whose interest is noticeably
academic -- one issue contained a piece on The Vampyre In the Works of
Strindberg while Carole Bohanan (founder of the society and editor of
the magazine) has regularly featured in newspaper articles on the
subject, as well as taking part in serious conferences and debates.
Bohanan has so immersed himself in matters vampiric that it is both
her life and career. For others, like Nicola Bull -- currently studying
communication and mass media at Caledonian University -- and Terry
Johns, the society is a way of meeting like-minded enthusiasts.
''I doubt whether I would have gone to Romania, if it hadn't been for
the society,'' says Bull. ''It was brilliant -- you do have lots of fun,
because the people in the society are very friendly. But it was also a
serious trip, where we went to all the historical places connected with
Vlad the Impaler and with Dracula, visited museums and churches, really
looked for the history as well as the legend.''
For the Glasgow Phil and the Vampyre Society alike, the message seems
to be, don't knock it till you've tried it . . . or dare one say, in the
best possible taste of course, ''bite it and believe it''.
* The Glasgow Philharmonic Orchestra's Hallowe'en Contest takes place
at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall tomorrow night (Sun Oct 29) at 7.30pm.

THE news that all the children allegedly abused in Ayrshire are now
reunited with their parents will bring gladness but little comfort to
the mother of the Orkney ''W'' children still in care (October 19).
For this week a curator-ad-litem is visiting her to establish her
reasons for objecting to the adoption of her two youngest children.
Should these reasons be deemed insufficient, the curator has explained,
they can be ''dispensed with''.
Since the ''W'' father was jailed in 1987 no evidence of further abuse
has ever been produced, yet (as in Ayrshire) the ''W'' case rests on
suspicion, allegation, discredited medical examination, and interview
methods described by Ayrshire's Sheriff Miller as ''totally unreliable''
and by Sheriff Kelbie as ''repeated coaching''.
Key information from a sheriff proof hearing, an adoption agency, and
a psychiatrist have been withheld. As a result the adoptive
foster-parents now hold two reports recommending adoption.
Meanwhile the younger child's persistent requests to visit Orkney are
being met with the foster-parents' response, ''We can't afford it,''
despite the psychiatrist's recommendation 14 months ago that she should
do so.
The children have not seen their mother for three years, sibling
access ceased recently for five months, and no rehabilitation has ever

IT is impossible to feel anything other than mounting anxiety about
what is happening in Russia at the moment. President Boris Yeltsin's
illness is clearly serious enough to keep him out of action for at least
a month. The next in the line of command, Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, is a capable enough performer but in the case of the Prime
Minister, as with so many senior Russian figures, it is dangerously easy
to judge on western perceptions rather than those which apply inside
Russia. Capable he may be, but Mr Chernomyrdin has many enemies inside
the Russian hierarchy, not least in the armed forces and within the
ranks of Mr Yeltsin's aides, all of whom will be jockeying energetically
for position as their master lies ill. Even worse, one of Mr Yeltsin's
last confusing acts was to downgrade his own Foreign Minister, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, by announcing his intention to take more personal control of
the Foreign Ministry because of Mr Kozyrev's alleged shortcomings over
former Yugoslavia. In fact, all that Mr Kozyrev did was to fail to pay
sufficient lip-service to Russian nationalist and pro-Serb propaganda
within Russia. In the shifting power struggle at the top, in which
greater consideration must be given to the nationalists, this was
clearly a mistake. As he has no power base to speak of within the
hierarchy Mr Kozyrev was in a weak position which has been compromised
further by President Yeltsin's actions. Russia, therefore, has an ailing
President, a beleaguered Prime Minister, a lame-duck Foreign Minister
and parliamentary and presidential elections in the offing.
Taken individually these factors would be enough to affect adversely
the strongest nation. Taken together they constitute a recipe for real
trouble. The very least that can be expected from the coming weeks is a
degree of instability which is as yet unquantifiable but which may
question the ability of the Russian federation to continue as a cohesive
unit. An inevitable consequence of this will be increased activity by
hard-line nationalists and communists, as was admitted yesterday by a
senior Yeltsin aide. Nor is it at all clear whether President Yeltsin
will be able to contest the presidential election next year, thus
opening up further avenues of confusion and political conflict.
In all of this the western nations can be little other than impotent
spectators. Of course, there will be anxiety at the prospect of extreme
nationalists or communists taking over, but the former is not
immediately likely and the reforms which have already been carried out
in Russia are unlikely to be reversed by the new communists who differ
in significant respects from their predecessors. The accession to
leadership of a former military commander is a possibility and General
Alexander Lebed comes to mind. This is an alarming prospect to some, but
the United States, for instance, has been relatively fortunate in those
of her military men who have become President, and the possibility can
hardly be sneered at by a nation which is beoming more enthusiastic at
the prospect of a presidential run by General Colin Powell. Above all
the west must keep cool and demonstrate great patience in coming weeks.
The inevitable instability in Russia will generate all sorts of rumour
and alarm. These will be exaggerated, as anyone familiar with Russian
politics can confirm. Western leaders can do a good deal in the way of
quiet reassurance in the forthcoming period, no matter what the outcome
of President Yeltsin's crisis. Patience and understanding will be the
key to helping Russia and her democrats, and beyond that there is very
little else that can be done except to watch.

THE return of floods to Perth and Kilmarnock, less than a year after
their last suffering, is deeply frustrating to the victims. Kilmarnock
is especially badly affected. A sense of local outrage is entirely
understandable and not least because little or nothing seems to have
been done in Kilmarnock's case to remedy defects exposed last year. It
is not entirely clear who should be responsible for putting in hand the
works required to prevent future occurrences of a similar nature, an
uncertainty likely to be worsened with the arrival of the new unitary
authorities coexisting with the new water authorities. There is no way
of knowing how much adequate flood control systems would cost but
''guesstimates'' run into many millions of pounds which, presumably,
would most likely have to come from Strathclyde's annual water and
sewerage budget of some #90m. That total, which seems large, is simply
not enough. Either the Government is going to have to provide funds for
whatever body is deemed responsible for putting remedial works in hand,
or that body is going to have to be allowed to make additional
borrowings to finance the same outcome. There is no painless way of
preventing repeated flooding in identifiable areas, if the recently
developing climatological pattern persists and exceptionally heavy
rainfall becomes a late autumn to winter feature of such districts.
The burden can fall only on taxpayers and council-tax payers though
there is also bound to be increasing water charges for those who pay
them. Apart from borrowing, where the immediate costs are not avoided,
only deferred, it is impossible to pinpoint alternative strategies. Far
from water being free, its collection and control demand the most
sophisticated systems, with high civil engineering costs, to prevent
flooding at times of excess rainfall and ensure adequate provision in
times of drought. High costs, too, are associated with sewerage, with
hygiene, and with the provision of clean beaches for bathing. All of
these aspects of the water industry are expensive but any initial costs
are pushed steeply upwards by the very high standards prescribed by the
EU water directives, and accepted as desirable by local and national
government as well as by consumers. Being aware of all that still leaves
unanswered the question of who should be responsible for Kilmarnock's
immediate problem and who should act to solve it in the short term.
The water industry as we now know it was the creation of the
Victorians. Their capital investment was considerable but not maintained
at the same level by their successors, including the present generation.
All authorities have been relatively slow to invest in water even though
increasing standards from lavatory provision to bathing habits have
increased demand mightily. Every Scottish region has more of its water
systems obsolescent than any would want. Correcting this will take years
and much money; and that effort will have also to deal with new
phenomena, such as the pressures on relatively old urban water systems
by the additional weight imposed on the pipes by the huge rise in car
ownership and use; and, if less certainly, by changing patterns of
rainfall, and their effect on long-established rivers and even minor
waterways. The present Government recognised much of this and sought to
counter it by privatisation. That experiment quickly proved so
unattractive in England and Wales that Scottish opinion had good reason
to be utterly opposed to its implementation here. We may yet, therefore,
enjoy a better public water system than our neighbours, but these
floods, and the confusion accompanying them, show that we are not there
yet.

FORT LAUDERDALE: A man of 91 was infected with the Aids virus by a
Texas prostitute who bit him during a robbery, the first confirmed
report of the disease being transmitted by a human bite.
Although health warnings have been issued in Palm Beach County about
the potential dangers of bites, state officials said this case had been
a bloodborne transmission of HIV, rather than by saliva. The attacker
had bleeding gums and bit the man deeply in three places, ripping off

A BRITON is pitting himself against a Norwegian rival in the hope of
becoming the first person to walk alone across the Antarctic -- using a
kite.
Mr Roger Mear, a veteran of the British Antarctic Survey team, will
use the giant kite to drag him one tenth of the 1700-mile trek across
the frozen wilderness.
The journey, due to last 100 days, will see Mr Mear take on explorer
Borge Ousland, the man who beat Briton Ranulph Fiennes to the North
Pole, when he sets out next week.
Travelling without the aid of a back-up team, the solo trek is
regarded as one of the last great outdoors adventures.
Mr Mear told BBC 1's Breakfast News yesterday: ''This project is so
big, the Antarctic is so big, if I thought whether it is possible to do,
to be at the finish, it just overwhelms you.
''All I can do now is concentrate on the thing in front, hour by hour
and day by day.''
Starting at the Weddell Sea on Wednesday, travelling south across the
South Pole and ending up at Ross Island, Mr Mear will have a few days
head-start over his Norwegian rival.
The contest mirrors the tragic first race to the South Pole in 1912,
which saw the Norwegian Amundsen beat Captain Robert Scott to glory by
nearly a month.
Scott also used the technique of kiting to speed his challenge
Mr Mear was among the first people to reach the South Pole on foot in
1982 -- a feat which opened a new era in Antarctic exploration. One of
Britain's foremost climbers and explorers, he has also made attempts on
Everest and K2.
Nutrition experts have devised tiny high energy biscuits and dried
foods to provide the necessary 5800 calories a day needed to carry out
the challenge.
Mr Mear is expected to average 17 miles a day dragging his 450lb
sledge.
It will also be possible to monitor the race's progress on the
Internet via a satellite link with the rival explorers' positions
charted on a map.--PA.

Jennifer Cunningham examines the implications of the judicial ruling
in favour of two cancer suffers who were exposed to asbestos as children
FOR 100 years people have been campaigning against the insidious
effects of asbestos on people's health. When a French textile
manufacturer in Calvados switched from spinning yarn to spinning
asbestos fibres, his workforce of more than 50 people all died. That was
in 1875. In 1898 a factories inspector, Lucy Deane, referred to it as
''this pernicious dust''.
The history lesson is relevant because yesterday Mr Justice Holland
ruled at Leeds High Court that the harmful effects of asbestos were
known as early as 1933 and that J W Roberts, a subsidiary of Turner and
Newall, which was once the world's largest manufacturer of asbestos
products, should have protected people living around their factory in
Leeds from that date.
The names of June Hancock and Evelyn Margereson will now be followed
by those of thousands of cancer sufferers whose disease has been caused
by exposure to asbestos. Yesterday's ruling that the Leeds women should
receive compensation for cancer contracted from environmental exposure
to asbestos has paved the way for 40 similar claims from the Armley area
around the J W Roberts factory, but the number of people with similar
exposure, who have never been able to prove their cases because they
could not prove occupational exposure, runs into thousands.
Many of them will be from Glasgow and Clydebank where there were a
number of factories processing asbestos and where, during the peak
exposures of the 60s and 70s, one-third of the world's shipping tonnage
was built on the Clyde and insulated with asbestos.
The next stage in the long and bitter fight against T and N (formerly
Turner and Newall) begins on Monday in New York when the Chase Manhattan
bank will bring a case for compensation for the use of asbestos in its
headquarters. The New York building code requires asbestos to be removed
from major public buildings and the cost of removal has been estimated
at #130m. Chase Manhattan is also seeking #100m in punitive damages.
Limpet asbestos was sprayed on to all the girders which formed the
structure of the building in 1958.
That case is linked to the Leeds one not only through T and N but
because it will rest on proving that they were aware of the dangers of
the asbestos at the time and, like the Armley case, it is expected to
set a precedent which would result in a flood of other claims. T and N
have always argued that the full nature of the dangers were not known
before 1959.
The significance of yesterday's judgment for thousands of ordinary
people with mesothelioma, the incurable lung cancer resulting from the
inhalation of asbestos particles of a size which lodge in the lungs, is
that it found in favour of people whose cases were regarded as the
weakest category: those not directly involved in working with it.
That means that all asbestos-related cases have been strengthened,
according to Glasgow solicitor-advocate Frank Maguire, who specialises
in industrial compensation cases.
''People usually fall into one of five categories: employees who
handled it, employees working alongside others working with asbestos,
visitors to the premises where it was processed or used, spouses, and
people who don't know it is in the building but become exposed to it
when they do a bit of DIY.''
Clydeside Action on Asbestos, the pressure group which carries out
research into asbestos-related illness and campaigns on behalf of
sufferers, greeted yesterday's judgment with delight. Tam Campbell, the
organisation's researcher, believes it could lead the way to product
liability actions in which the manufacturing company could be help
responsible for the product.
''Until now, the economic argument has always won, because if everyone
affected by asbestos-related cancer was compensated, it would bankrupt
the country -- and their numbers are increasing. There are now more
people being killed by asbestos-related cancers than by road accidents.
No-one can say when it will end, because we know that not only people
using asbestos as insulation, but ancillary trades working beside them
and increasingly people renovating buildings are affected,'' he said.
Campbell believes that we are likely to see an increase in the rates
of mesothelioma as the less stringent regulations on workers off-shore
expose more workers to asbestos and the buildings of the 60s
construction boom require renovation.
His fears are borne out by the Health and Safety Executive, a body
which has never been known for scaremongering. Their latest annual
report records: ''Deaths from mesothelioma, most of which are believed
to be associated with past exposure to asbestos, are now being recorded
at more than 1000 annually . . . The number of mesothelioma deaths is
expected to go on rising very probably until 2010 and possibly up to
2025.''

Barclay McBain reports how homework is a growing feature of school
life
HAS David Blunkett done his homework on Labour's proposals to
encourage pupils to learn and study more out of class and in their own
time? Helen Liddell, who now speaks for the party on Scottish education,
certainly thinks the Shadow education secretary deserves high marks for
his speech yesterday in which he sought to give homework a central role
in schooling.
Under Labour, schools and parents in England and Wales will be
encouraged to collaborate to ensure that children over seven do at least
half an hour of homework every night, increasing to a daily minimum of
90 minutes in the secondary sector.
We shall have to wait awhile for Scottish Labour's thinking on the
role of homework in our schools since its policy document on Scottish
education is still being written. But homework will certainly feature in
it, given Mrs Liddell's endorsement of Mr Blunkett's thinking.
The Government is also keen to promote homework, but it would be wrong
to conclude that Scottish education is coming in on the back of English
schooling in this matter. The reverse is, in fact, the case, as the
experience of English parents who move to Scotland confirms. The common
reaction is one of surprise about the amount of homework given to their
children compared with out-of-school demands made on them south of the
Border.
The success of the Homework File -- a Scottish Office pack published
last year which encourages schools to develop effective homework
policies -- tells a similar story. The pack has been sent to every
Scottish school but it has sold very well in Northern Ireland -- which
is also strong on homework -- and in England, which lags behind and
where there is no similar aid to promoting homework.
The Quality in Education centre at Strathclyde University in Glasgow
was commissioned to produce the pack, which highlights good practice in
local authority schools, after Scottish Office schools' inspectors found
that although most primaries and secondaries said they had a policy on
homework there were big differences in the amount, frequency, and
quality.
The pack confirmed a big change in the status of homework. It had been
frequently viewed as an irritating, pointless chore but increasingly its
key role in raising levels of pupil achievement -- backed up by research
finding -- was being appreciated.
Professor John MacBeath, a director of the centre, welcomed Mr
Blunkett's speech as a contribution to the debate about the role of
parents in supporting children's learning, the purpose of homework, and
what children do with their own time.
''It is good that he recognises that learning out of school is one of
the key ingredients of success,'' he said. He had doubts, however, about
the benefit of setting down the time to be spent on homework.
In Professor MacBeath's experience, the most effective policies had
been agreed by the school, its pupils, and its parent body. ''I'd say
that general guidelines are useful but it's really down to individual
schools to negotiate acceptable options.''
He was also worried about limiting homework to seven-year-olds and
above. ''The absolutely critical school years are five and six, and the
best practice is found in schools which involve parents in supporting
learning at these stages through such activities as paired reading.''
Mr Blunkett attacked the role of television, the thief in the corner
which caused children to spend 12 times longer watching programmes than
they did studying at home. But Professor MacBeath pointed out that
Strathclyde region's ''Parent Prompts'' showed how TV and homework could
go hand in hand by encouraging parents to use their children's viewing
to contribute to their understanding of their classroom learning.
One of the main objections against homework has come from teachers who
argue that it should not be given at all because it discriminates
against pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds who have neither the
facilities nor the support at home.
But study support schemes which involve such pupils working under
supervision in school after hours are popular.
Professor MacBeath said: ''The attitude that kids should have their
own time for play and growing up in, leaving schools behind them, is
dying out. The practical issue in secondary schools is to co-ordinate
homework to ensure that pupils do not have one and a half hours of
English homework, two hours of maths, and so on. Teachers need to get
their act together.''

The more she insisted, as she did repeatedly, that the NHS was not for
profit, not for sale, and would continue to be true to its founding
principles, the less people believed her
Virginia! Virginia! The devil is
in ya --
Virginia, don't go too far, dear.
You're truly, unruly,
Do take things more cooly.
Virginia, think who you are!*
IMAGINE the scene. Spring 1948, and baby Virginia Hilda Brunette
Garnett's fairy godmothers have turned out in force at the font. The
first says Ginnie will grow up to be beautiful, good and as clever as
may be. The second, that she will marry a handsome, devoted husband,
have three children and live happily ever after. The third, that she
will go far in her chosen profession, outstripping many other women and
men in the process.
But then there is a kerfuffle at the chapel door. It is Carabosse who
announces with a nasty laugh that none of these blessings will amount to
a row of beans when it comes to being popular. Virginia will be
misunderstood.
It is one of the paradoxes of present-day politics that a politician
with so many pluses should be so detested, should possess such a
devastating minus, the reverse of the Midas touch, one in which
everything touched turns not to gold but lead.
Virginia grew up to marry Peter Bottomley -- her childhood sweetheart,
who also became an MP -- and to outstrip his ministerial career. He was
an under-secretary at Transport, Employment, and then Northern Ireland
where his career was terminated in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher.
Virginia made the Cabinet in 1992 as Secretary of State for Health,
after John Major bowed to pressure and brought a woman into his Cabinet
for the first time -- the job which turned her from a competent, but
nothing special, junior minister, admired more for her looks than her
policies, into a national hate figure.
Something had to be done. The NHS, if wrongly handled, is a vote
loser, and she was moved to National Heritage in the last reshuffle in
one of those musical chairs swops -- the incumbent, Stephen Dorrell,
taking her place at Health.
Whereas he had been Mr Anonymous, a misfit presiding over nothing in
particular, no sooner had Virginia turned up in the Heritage
department's office off Trafalgar Square than the most boring ministry
in the political spectrum suddenly became a centre of controversy.
The current glorious National Lottery row -- she has just turned down
the changes proposed by the Council of Churches in what she called
''truly the Dream Machine'' -- and all the criticism over Camelot's
licence to shovel money into its bank account have placed her back
centre stage, and she has even crossed swords with Richard ''a
disappointed loser'' Branson.
It was all good fun, but the interesting thing is she did not emerge
as the champion of fun and flutter, but sounded as pi as ever she did
when at Health.
Luck in politics involves having a ministry which people are
interested in -- some politicians inherit potentially sexy jobs only to
find things go dead on them -- and the ability to use any controversy to
one's own advantage. It is this which repeatedly eludes her.
A fully-qualified graduate, as somebody said, of the Shirley Williams
School for Meaningful and Compassionate Politicians, except that she has
impeccable dress sense and beautifully styled hair, Virginia Bottomley
is a wholly recognisable English type.
She is one of those leggy, athletic Home Counties girls Angela Brazil
wrote about and John Betjeman adored; a lady of the manor in the
Penelope Keith mould -- the Garnetts are terribly well connected and
posh, albeit on the left in politics -- who does good works in the
village, runs the Girl Guides, and is deeply caring, especially since it
allows her to tell people what to do for their own good.
In other words, she is a born bossyboots. But so was Mrs Thatcher, and
whereas strong men just loved taking the medicine from Nanny Margaret,
when it comes to Nurse Virginia they make a face and spit it out.
Born in Dunoon, she grew up in England, partly on the Isle of Wight,
where she and her family still holiday, and which she contested
unsuccessfully for the Tories in the 1983 General Election, and partly
in London.
She was educated at Putney High School, read sociology at Essex
University, joined the Conservative Party there, and got married, aged
19, when six months pregnant with her first child, Joshua. She had met
her future husband, Peter, when she was twelve, and he was 15, at a
children's party.
He chopped and changed jobs while seeking a political career -- he
entered the Commons in 1975 -- and she went on to do a further degree at
the London School of Economics, before starting work as a researcher
with the Child Poverty Action Group, and lecturing at an adult education
college in her spare time.
She became a psychiatric social worker in south London, a magistrate
at Lambeth Juvenile Court, and vice-chairman of the National Council of
Carers. She was in every respect the perfect Tory backbencher's wife,
combining career, family and supporting her husband in his constituency
with seeming ease.
But her ambition appears, despite this period of waiting wifelike in
the wings, to have been to get to Parliament too. Selected to fight the
Isle of Wight, with all those family links it ought to have been a
push-over. Things turned out otherwise, and she failed to ''Turn Wight
Blue'', her campaign slogan, despite strident support from Mrs Thatcher
in a hovercraft.
Although she failed to take the seat from the Liberals, she had fought
the good fight in the party's eyes and was picked the following year to
fight the Surrey South-West by-election caused by the death of Maurice
Macmillan. She is still there, having made it a rock solid safe seat,
while her husband, who has represented Greenwich and Woolwich, and now
Eltham, since 1975, is looking without success for a seat because of
boundary changes.
Within a year of being elected she was made parliamentary private
secretary to Chris Patten at the Department of Education and Science,
where she stayed for two years, and then was PPS at the Ministry for
Overseas Development from 1986-87, before being promoted to become PPS
to Sir Geoffrey Howe, then Foreign Secretary. It was an impeccable
progress up the ladder to a job.
In 1988 Mrs Thatcher, no friend to politically motivated women, gave
her one; a junior post at Environment and then a better one at Health,
which turned the Bottomleys into a unique Tory husband and wife
ministerial team. He, however, was generally regarded as less steady
than she, and Mrs Thatcher terminated his career before suffering the
same fate herself.
Virginia, however, survived and when Major became Prime Minister had
every reason to expect promotion. But in a peculiarly hamfisted piece of
Cabinet making he put no women in his first team, a mistake he remedied
after the 1992 General Election. Mrs Bottomley, then Minister of State
at Health, duly became Health Secretary, free at last to impose her will
on the nation.
She has always been regarded with some suspicion, and envy, by her
fellow MPs as somebody who is too ambitious, and too soft with her civil
servants. The nicknames have proliferated, and along the way she has
acquired the reputation of being not very nice to the people who work
under her, being said to play the part of the grande dame too much and
to find time only for people she considers might be useful.
She is said to be capable of being quite ruthless, but to be more a
department's minister than a politician's one. In other words, she will
do what she's told and do it competently, sticking closely to her Civil
Service brief. As long as she sticks to her brief she is secure. The
minute she moves beyond it the quicksands open up.
But this means she is difficult to persuade when confronted with a
political argument since she has swallowed the administrative ones
first, not an asset for any Minister. The question is whether behind the
handsome facade lies any substance.
She has not achieved all her aims. At one point last year she was
letting it be known she would like to be party chairman, a job which she
did not get and was generally thought to have presumed in asking for it.
Her period at Health was fraught with rows, particularly over her
plans for London where the ancient teaching hospitals fell victim to her
reforms, and she was accused of vandalism, and of failing to make her
own essential, human, social, clinical, medical and political judgments.
But in truth she was only carrying out the policies inherited from her
predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, a politician adept at getting moved before
the chickens come home to roost. She did so with almost religious
fervour, and it was her inability to bend, to understand how to play the
compromise card which contributed to what she was doing being so
unpopular.
She was perceived as a wrecker of the NHS. It was unfair, but there
was nothing she could do about it.
She was lucky in not having any strikes by health workers to face, and
her Shadows, Margaret Beckett and then David Blunkett, did not do all
that much damage to her. She did it to herself, sometimes inadvertently,
as the time she decided to do some shopping and got Marks and Spencer to
open up its Oxford Street store out of hours so she could make a
quasi-royal process picking out her new wardrobe. It was the kind of
elitist behaviour which could not be explained away.
The more she insisted, as she did repeatedly, that the NHS was not for
profit, not for sale, and would continue to be true to its founding
principles, the less people believed her.
Not that she made many real mistakes. She handled the issues which
arose ranging from toxic waste to Romanian babies and the poll tax for
nurses, with considerable skill. She has loads of common sense and can
apply it. But it is not doing the right thing that matters in politics;
it is being perceived to be doing the right thing.
It is this trick which has eluded her, first at Health and now at
Heritage where she has sounded one dud note after another. Her one piece
of genuinely good fortune is that her Shadow, Dr Jack Cunningham, is an
even bigger political albatross.

GONE are the tub-thumping election promises. The role of the
big-hearted, socially concerned Gaullist has been discarded. Last week,
President Jacques Chirac effected a complete turn-about in policy.
Fighting unemployment is no longer ''the priority of priorities''.
Reducing taxation, the other big electoral pledge, will have to wait at
least two years. Indeed taxes, already increased during the summer, are
to go up again, for the President has announced that policy must now
repose first and foremost on a cut in public spending. The new
priorities are to conform with the terms of the Maastricht Treaty and
prepare for a single currency by 1999.
The turn-about, announced on Thursday, has already been compared with
the historical vest turning performed by President Mitterrand in 1983,
when he abandoned his Marxist-inspired programme to join the monetarist
camp, along with virtually every other Western economy.
However President Mitterrand had been in power two years, at the head
of an inexperienced government. President Chirac has been only six
months in office with seasoned politicians. He is more unpopular now
than any other President of the Fifth Republic so soon into his mandate,
and likely to become more so.
The policy switch, which disappointed supporters across the board,
might have appeared more convincing had it been accompanied by a
government reshuffle. Instead, apparently unwilling or afraid to disavow
his old ally and Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, President Chirac is
holding on to the same team, reinforcing the image of improvisation and
lack of direction which is ridiculing this government at home and
abroad.
The need to cut public spending loomed large in France throughout the
summer, appearing quite at odds with the generous, vote-catching pledges
of President Chirac. Social measures he has taken seem to be merely
giving with one hand what he takes with the other. An emergency plan,
for example, was pushed through to help 70,000 long-term unemployed, and
the legal minimum wage was raised 4% to help spending. To pay for the
measures, however, VAT went up to 20% in August and tax on petrol was
increased.
Although further financial measures will not go before the National
Assembly until November 14, they should include a 1% increase in the
CSG, a supplementary income tax aimed at reducing the health service
overdraft. The latter, which stands at #7.5bn, has to be halved over the
next 12 months.
President Chirac said on Thursday that France's economy was in good
shape but that the country's finances were badly managed. The fight
against unemployment, still well over the three million mark, and a
lowering of France's very high interest rates, now depended, he said, on
reducing public spending. Tax cuts would have to wait at least two years
until the benefit of the most recent measures was felt.
His bullish approach to foreign policy has also been falling about his
ears. The cancellation last weekend of a meeting in New York with
Algerian President, General Liamine Zeroual, was a humiliation of a sort
which few French leaders have had to stomach.
Announced tactlessly three weeks in advance, the summit was fiercely
criticised at home because France appeared to be taking sides in the
Algerian civil war. President Chirac retorted that he simply wanted to
demand more democratic behaviour from the general, who is a candidate in
the presidential election next month. Algerian public opinion, however,
interpreted that attitude as condescension and interference from the
leader of a former colonial power. The general cancelled the meeting in
what was undoubtedly an election trick to boost his popularity at the
expense of President Chirac.
Even dyed-in-the-wool Gaullists who campaigned hard for President
Chirac are appalled by the results of the last six months.
''Mitterrand was a bastard, but a competent one. Chirac is not even
that,'' one of them confided last week.
Those, not very numerous, who still believe in the President's
ability, believe that the last six months have been an uncomfortable
period of apprenticeship. Others point out that the French leader, twice
Prime Minister and for nearly 20 years leader of the Gaullist Party, has
considerable experience of being in power, and that the presidential
election last May simply threw up the wrong man.
* BANKRUPT French tycoon Bernard Tapie, former boss of the Marseilles
football club, faces a new trial in April, charged with fraud over
alleged misuse of a luxury yacht.
Tapie, who was a Cabinet Minister in a Socialist-led government, will
be charged with using the 245ft Phocea almost exclusively for personal
trips when it was listed as a commercial venture in his business empire.
He is already under threat of a jail term for rigging a football match
in 1993.
The four-masted Phocea, the biggest yacht of its type in France with
10 double cabins, has become a symbol of Tapie's rags-to-riches-to-rags
career.
A court in northern France ended hearing Tapie's appeal on Thursday
against a one-year jail sentence, with another year suspended, imposed
by a lower court for rigging a league soccer match between Marseilles
and the Valenciennes team in 1993.
The court will give its verdict on November 28.

Monrovia
A NIGERIAN ship with more than 500 passengers and crew was on the
verge of sinking in deep waters off the Liberian port of Buchanan today.
Peacekeepers in Liberia said an SOS from the captain identified the
ship only as MV-4. Most of the passengers were West African traders with
heavy goods, including many cars, machinery, and scrap metal.
''We have received an SOS message and according to the crewmen the
problems are severe,'' one source said. Dozens of local fishing boats
were mobilising for a rescue effort.
The ship was thought to be headed for Ghana and Nigeria.
One source in the Ecomog African force policing Liberia suggested the
vessel may have been overloaded.
Panic-stricken passengers and crew were dumping cars and machinery
overboard to prevent the vessel listing.
''They have already dumped seven cars and a few tractors with other
scrap material, but the problem remains,'' he added.
Last June a Nigerian coaster, the Princess Olayinka, lost power as it
sailed from Lagos to Monrovia. It drifted precariously with more than
700 West African passengers until it was towed to safety in Togo, Lome.
Port officials said then the vessel was hardly seaworthy and had been
dangerously overloaded.--Reuter.

Milan
TWO former Italian Prime Ministers, Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani,
and the leader of the Northern League were today jailed for corruption
by a Milan court in what has been dubbed ''the mother of all corruption
trials''.
The so-called Enimont trial, which began 16 months ago, put Italy's
old political elite and their business friends in the dock. The 22
defendants, all found guilty, included the heads of Italy's old ruling
parties and League leader Umberto Bossi.
Other big names convicted included former Foreign Minister Gianni de
Michelis and former Justice Minister Claudio Martelli, both members of
Craxi's Socialist Party.
The prosecution claimed that the Ferruzzi industrial group distributed
some #59m to political parties for favours and to extricate itself from
a disastrous chemicals joint venture with the state energy concern.
Craxi, who is living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia and has already
been convicted in other corruption cases, was sentenced to four years
and eight months in jail.
Forlani, a Christian Democrat, was sentenced to two years and four
months and the League's Bossi to eight months. A number of businessmen
were also sentenced.
The verdicts and sentences are subject to appeal.--Reuter.

MOST Russians appeared indifferent to the fate of Yeltsin, saying they
were either too uninformed, too indifferent, or too busy making ends
meet to worry about his health.
Everyone thought it would at least be ''a shame'' if Yeltsin's heart
condition eventually led to his death, but many said they would not vote
for him even if he ran for another term.
''Of course it would be a shame if he died,'' said 43-year-old Grigory
Livshits, a former engineer who now makes better money as a taxi driver,
''but I won't be voting for him again anyway.''
However those with fond memories of the day when Yeltsin stood on a
tank outside the besieged White House made emotive pleas to their
president to get well soon.
''For God's sake let him live. Give him his health,'' Rita, 50, said
passionately.
Others seemed less than fascinated. ''As a human being, of course, I
want Yeltsin to get well. But to be honest I didn't even know he was
ill,'' said Tanya, a teacher who now works as a cleaner.
''I gave up watching the news after they shot up the White House. I
just try to concentrate on the happy things in life. My own life is
depressing enough,'' she added.

Washington
IAN PAISLEY went to the White House today to tell President Clinton
not to meddle in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
He did not see the president himself, but Vice-President Al Gore
dropped by while he was meeting Anthony Lake, the president's national
security adviser.
He said afterwards: ''We got assurance from both the vice president
and Mr Lake there would be no internal interference in Northern
Ireland's internal affairs, and that the president would not in any way
be saying anything that would show he was not politically neutral when
he comes to Northern Ireland.''
The vice-president's encounter with Mr Paisley was, of course, no
casual event. It had been planned. Mr Paisley is being taken seriously
because the president is visiting Northern Ireland at the end of next
month, in the course of his visit to Britain and Ireland.
Mr Clinton hopes that some progress can be made before then in
starting the peace talks. A White House spokesman said that both the
vice-president and Mr Lake assured Mr Paisley that the United States was
neutral in Irish matters, seeking only to promote peace there.
A statement said the Clinton administration saw a basis for progress
in ''twin-track'' proposals for starting peace talks on Northern Ireland
and establishing an international body on decommissioning weapons at the
same time.
Mr Paisley may not have believed the Americans. After his session
inside, he stood in the driveway of the White House and said: ''We have
one great concern and that is that there be no interference from the
White House and from the president in the internal affairs of Northern
Ireland.''
He added that ''some of the statements that have been made by the
administration have been even more than meddling, they have been
downright interference. We cannot accept that.''
He then went on to denounce the peace process, which he described as
an attempt by Britain to end the union and sell out the northern
Protestants to Dublin. He said it was futile to expect Unionist parties
to attend the peace talks before the IRA is disarmed.
The new leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble, will be here
next week, and hopes to see the president. He can be sure of at least as
formal a reception as Mr Paisley, and no doubt he will be rather less
provocative than him. He will be accompanied by Ken Maginnis and other
party officials, and will open a party bureau here, to counter the
effects of the Sinn Fein office that opened early this year.
The Unionist case has received very little attention here over the
years, partly because of the strength of the Irish Catholic lobby, but
partly because Unionists have not tried to make their views known with
anything like the enthusiasm shown by Sinn Fein.
Mr Trimble will be doing the rounds of newspaper editorial boards, the
National Press Club and CNN, and will put his case for more American
investment in Northern Ireland to gatherings of businessmen.
Another Northern Irish politician, John Alderdice, is also coming
through Washington, to offer the Alliance's views on the situation.

Montreal
IN AN emotional outpouring of patriotism, tens of thousands of
Canadians converged on Montreal today to declare their love of a united
Canada and beg Quebec voters not to vote for separation.
As if rushing to the side of a family member in grave danger,
Canadians dropped whatever they were doing and came by air, train or
road from towns across the world's second largest country. Some parents
took their children out of school and businesses and the federal
government allowed people to take a day off to go to Quebec.
A traffic jam began 20 miles outside Montreal as buses and cars made
their way to the ''Crusade for Canada'' demonstration .
Quebec's five million voters will choose in a referendum on Monday
whether the province should separate from Canada. The rally was
organised to try to stop the momentum of the Quebec independence
movement, which is leading in the polls.
The latest poll published today showed Quebec separatists ahead by 46%
to 40% among decided voters. The outcome appeared to hinge on the 14% of
voters who polls show are still undecided.
Organisers estimated more than 100,000 people thronged the Place du
Canada (Canada Square) in Montreal for the midday rally, waving Canada's
maple leaf flag and Quebec's fleur-de-lis flag and singing the national
anthem, ''O Canada''.
Montrealers said it was the biggest political rally they could
remember.
Chants of ''Non, Non, Non'' -- ''No'' to separation -- echoed through
the city centre, and signs in French and English said ''We belong
together'' and ''My Canada includes Quebec''.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who warned on Wednesday that Canada was
facing a crisis, thanked people for coming ''to lend their hand to the
survival of Canada''.
''We have built a country that is the envy of the world, this country
of generosity and sharing, this country of tolerance . . . this country
where people from across the continents would give up everything they
had to share Canadian citizenship. This is what Canada is all about,''
Chretien said.
In Washington, State Department officials said an independent Quebec
would not automatically get the benefits Canada now enjoys from its
relationship with the United States, including trading benefits.
This was the message President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher were trying to convey in recent statements on Quebec,
they said.
''We have had an enormously successful relationship with a united
Canada,'' an official told reporters.
''The secretary said last week that there is no automaticity attached
to the benefits of the US-Canadian relationship to those who might
separate themselves.''
No violence was reported at the rally, but a handful of separatists
and Canadian unity supporters jostled briefly as the crowd dispersed.
Some separatist supporters said they doubted tha the rally it would
convince committed separatists to change sides, but it might sway some
of the crucial undecided.
However one supporter, Quebec student Ian Bergeron, said: ''It would
surprise me a lot if it changed anyone's mind. It's insulting after
everything that's happened.''
Separatist leaders said the emotional outpouring for Quebec was too
little, too late.--Reuter/AP.

HOMES and businesses in the centre of Perth were also hit by foods.
One road was closed and six homes were evacuated as a high tide and
heavy rain combined to flood parts of the city.
Basements flats in Marshall Place were under two foot of water and the
South Inch was flooded after Craigie Burn burst its banks.
The basements of three businesses were flooded as heavy traffic forced
flood water into the buildings.
Firefighters pumped out water from homes and businesses. He added that
drivers had added to the problem by driving over roads which were under
ten inches of water.
''We faced the problem that there was nowhere for the water to go, the
drainage system was filled to capacity.''
Ninety-one millimetres of rain was recorded at Glenlyon in Perthshire
in two days and flood warnings were posted for the Lower Tummel and
Middle and Upper Tay. The B846 near Aberfeldy was closed and throughout
Perthshire farmers were advised to move livestock to higher ground.

THE new West of Scotland Water Authority, which will take over control
of water and sewerage services in Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway
regions next April, admitted yesterday ) that it is having ''very
considerable'' problems with its budget for 1996/97.
The authority which covers more than half the population of Scotland
has estimated that water bills are likely to increase by between 10% and
15% next year as a result of a forecast increase in expenditure of
between the same amounts in the first year alone.
This echoes the view taken earlier this week by the East of Scotland
Water Authority, which is expected to introduce rises of around 15%.
Mr John Jameson, chairman of the Government-appointed quango, said
after yesterday's meeting in Lochgilphead that the WSWA would seek to
keep water charges ''as low as possible'' but stressed that strict new
requirements mean massive amounts of capital investment are needed for
water treatment, pipe renovation, and sewage treatment facilities. This
would inevitably affect charges.
Capital expenditure is likely to total #100m for the coming year and
is expected to increase over the next five years to about #200m a year.
Mr Jameson said he was confident that efficiency savings could be made
but conceded that to prevent such increases in charges would require
''something special'' and possibly some debts being written off.
He said the planned efficiency savings would not involve compulsory
redundancies.
Mr Ernest Chambers, chief executive of the West of Scotland Water
Authority, also said the authority would have no role in flood
prevention.
''At the moment there are discretionary, not mandatory, powers for
regional councils to undertake flood prevention schemes and the basic
responsibility rests with the riparian owners, the people who own the
land on either side of the rivers.''
Mr Chambers said: ''These discretionary powers will pass to the
unitary authorities, not the water authorities, so we will have no
responsibility.''
Almost all of what was intended to be a public meeting of the
authority, at Argyll and Bute District Council's headquarters, was held
in private after disruption by protesters against the removal of water
and sewerage services from local authority control.
A group of about 25 supporters of the Hands off our Water (HOW)
campaign, led by Glasgow District Councillor Tommy Sheridan, attended
the meeting.
Mr Sheridan and others called on the 22 members present to justify
their positions on the board and detail their remuneration.
Two Argyll councillors, Billy Petrie and Robert Reid, responded to the
questions but HOW supporters were not satisfied and repeated their
questions, while also accusing members of having no mandate to control
water services because they were unelected by and unaccountable to the
public.
Mr John Jameson, chairman of the authority, struggling to make himself
heard above the protests, then told members: ''It seems to me impossible
to hold the meeting.'' He led them from the council chamber to continue
the meeting in private in an adjacent lounge.
Mr Sheridan said after the protest: ''We came to disrupt the transfer
of water services and that is what we did and will continue to do at
every meeting they hold.''
SNP Councillor Campbell Cameron, who represents Lorne and Mull on
Argyll and Bute District Council, was among the protesters.
He said later that he believed the authority members were wrong to
continue their deliberations behind closed doors.
Mr Jameson said after the meeting :''I think the protesters have
misread the situation quite badly. The authority is now established by
Parliament, by law, and therefore it seems to me that what we have got
to do is get on with it and use the system to provide the best possible
service we can for the people of the West of Scotland and that is what
we are trying to do.''

doctors to give their blessing to death with dignity but he refused to
sanction euthanasia.
At the Baptist's annual Scottish assembly in Inverness, Professor
David Short said he thought treatment for terminally ill patients should
be stopped.
His views will be put to the executive committee of Scotland's Baptist
Union on December 5. It will then formulate an official stance on behalf
of Scotland's 15,000 Baptists.
Professor Short, retired consultant physician at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, was against intentional killing but he believed doctors
should not be blamed for administering too strong a dose of painkilling
drugs, even if the practice ultimately proved fatal.
He said there was confusion between good medical care, which could
involve unintentional death, and intentional killing.
He told the last day of the assembly: ''When a doctor has a patient in
severe pain he does all he can to relieve it. But the margin of
relieving pain and a dose to kill the patient is extremely narrow.''
He said the demand for euthanasia to be legalised was from the
perception that doctors were in the business of prolonging life to the
last moment.
''People do not want to be attached to tubes and wires. They say that
when they reach the end of the road they don't want to get in that
situation and claim the answer is to press for legalisation of
euthanasia so they can be peacefully put to sleep.
''Good medical care does not require that we just go on butting our
heads against the wall to give a person a few days or hours of extra
life.''
On the question of brain death, he added: ''When the brain ceases to
be responsive to a number of tests then it is legitimate to accept that
that person is dead and all attempts at life support should be switched
off.''
Glenrothes minister Neil Allis said he had studied euthanasia in
Holland, where they were now having great difficulties: ''It has grown
out of all proportion, to a stage where there is an active progression
of killing a patient.
''More than a third of euthanasia cases are without permission of the
patient. The disabled, and schizophrenics, no longer trust the law to
protect their welfare.
''If and when euthanasia comes in here, it is the start of a slippery
slope.''
During his address, Professor Short also spoke of the ''snags'' of
living wills -- a statement of the wishes of a person wanting to avoid a
degrading end to life.
He said: ''They are superfluous, as patients do not want their life to
be prolonged in indignity. A doctor would say the same.
''I would like doctors to take the attitude of not prolonging life any
more than they would want it prolonged if it were themselves.''
He said he was not seriously against living wills, but believed people
in favour of euthanasia were using them as a stepping stone towards
euthanasia.

A WEEK after his father's mysterious death, Mr Kevin Maxwell went to
the Bank of England to discuss the group's problems with the then deputy
governor, Mr Eddie George, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
Mr Maxwell, who was accompanied by senior NatWest executive John
Melbourn and Mr George, now the bank's governor, went through a long
list of problems.
Asked by his counsel, Mr Alun Jones QC, what was the attitude of the
Bank of England, Mr Maxwell replied: ''They encouraged me, and
specifically the company, to work closely and rely on John Melbourn.
Eddie George said he had tremendous experience in handling this type of
situation and we could not have a better man to help us.''
Earlier this week, Mr Maxwell accused Mr Melbourn of ''threatening''
him and refusing to hand back shares which the bank had been holding as
a security, even after a promised amount had been repaid.
He claimed Mr Melbourn's threat was that the NatWest would not support
a standstill proposal unless he, Mr Maxwell, withdrew instructions over
the payment of a debt.
Mr Maxwell also accused Barclays Bank of demanding money -- also in
the troubled days after his father's death in November 1991 -- in
''circumstances as close to commercial blackmail as I have ever
experienced''.
He said Barclays also threatened to ''destroy'' the standstill
proposals unless they got a share of money held by MCC at NatWest.
He said he and the MCC board had agreed the payment to Barclays in the
face of the threats.
Earlier, the Maxwell Group's relationship with Barclays had been more
cordial. Barclays' lending to the Maxwell group peaked at #500m but by
1991 it had dropped to around #200m.
Mr Maxwell put down the ''explosive growth'' of the bank's lending in
the 1980s to his father's close friendship with Sir John Quinton,
Barclays' chairman
Mr Maxwell, 36, Ian Maxwell, 39, and Larry Trachtenberg, 42, a former
Maxwell financial adviser, deny conspiracy to defraud the pension funds
by misusing shares.
The trial continues.

Arrival of new rave drug raises the risk of deaths.
SUPER-ecstasy, three times stronger than the usual drug and possibly
three times more likely to kill, has been seized for the first time in
raids in Scotland.
The drug, technically known as MBDB, is from the same chemical family
as normal ecstasy, MDMA.
Police attending the annual Scottish Drugs Conference in Dunblane
yesterday were told that Strathclyde Police drugs squad had seized the
new drug in two raids in the last month.
Detective Inspector Keith Macdonald said 700 tablets were found in a
raid in the Paisley area and smaller amounts on people at a Glasgow
night club.
The white tablets are the size and shape of a Disprin and are marked
with a dollar sign.
They sell for up to #30 each, more than four times the price of
standard ecstacy.
Mr Macdonald said: ''The prevalance and availability of this drug has
still to be assessed but it appears to be two to three times stronger
than ecstasy. The ravers are raving about it.
''This drug is at the top end of the strength scale in the ecstasy
family.
''We know ecstasy kills and if this drug is two to three times
stronger it may also be two to three times more lethal.''
He also said that rave-goers had recently being using Temazepam to
mask the effects of ecstasy before going home to their parents.
He said dealers were well aware of developments in the market and were
selling ''party packs'' at raves containing amphetamine or ecstasy,
Temazepam, and sometimes cannabis for use at different stages of the
night.
More and more they were trying to cover their activities in a cloak of
respectability.
''Some of them are getting involved in charity work, or setting
themselves up as modern-day Robin Hoods, and some impressionable
youngsters are falling for it,'' he said.
''However, whether he is trading in heroin, MDMA, amphetamine,
cannabis, or cocaine, the drug dealer is clever, devious, and above all
very very greedy.
''He will be vigilant. He will be identifying new areas and gaps in
the market where he can ply his trade.
''No area, however remote, is immune from the drug dealer's
attention.''
Criminologist Mark Gilman, who has researched rave behaviour, warned
the conference of the danger to women posed by men who had taken crack
cocaine, which he called ''the most sexually predatory of all drugs''.
In one recent case, an 18-year-old in the Wirral had emerged from a
night club and got into a car with three men who had taken cocaine. They
raped her. Because she had taken ecstasy herself, she was too frightened
to report the attack.
He said a study from Manchester University showed that 76% of
teenagers had been offered illegal drugs before they were 16, and 51%
had said yes.
''Statistically speaking, it is the non drug-user who is now the
deviant,'' he said.
''Never in the history of human endeavour have so many people used so
many illegal drugs. Never have they been younger and never have they had
so many illegal drugs to chose from.''
Closer to home, prison social worker Anne McCorquodale revealed that
nearly one woman in three at Cornton Vale prison near Stirling had drug
or alcohol problems, and drugs and drink were behind a disproportionate
number of women's crimes.

THE chairman of the Local Authority Accounts Commission, Professor Ian
Percy, is to take up the #7500 a year number two position at the Water
and Sewerage Customers' Council, the Scottish Office announced
yesterday.
Professor Percy, who is a former president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland, will act as deputy to council
chairman Dick Douglas the former Labour MP, who is now a Scottish
National Party member. He will work for about six days a month.
Also appointed to the consumer watchdog is Mr John Connolly, a Central
region Labour councillor and a former Cosla water and sewerage chief.
Although Cosla refused to make any nominations to the three new water
quangos, it did put forward four names for membership of the council.
Yesterday it welcomed the appointment of three of the four, including
Councillor Connolly, by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
The others are Liberal Democrat Rhona Kemp, Grampian region's
convener, and Dumfries and Galloway depute chief executive Iain Stewart.
With expectation rising that water charges in their first year outside
council control could soar by 15% to 20%, the consumers' watchdog will
clearly be centre stage in the row which would follow such rises.
Mr Forsyth stressed yesterday that it would be independent of the
three water authorities. Its role would be to protect and represent the
interests of all customers.
The council will have to approve the charges set by the new bodies
otherwise the matter goes to the Secretary of State. It will also have
to approve the codes of practice which they are required to produce.
Seven other members have been appointed. They are Professor Tom
Anderson, retired director of sewerage for Strathclyde region, Ann
Calman, retired teacher and non-executive director in the West Glasgow
Hospitals University NHS Trust, Independent Councillor Lynn Groundwater
from Orkney, Conservative Councillor Alexander Scott from the Borders
region, Bill Howatson, agricultural editor of the Aberdeen Press and
Journal, Angus S. MacDonald, a farmer and director of various companies
from Dingwall who is also Crown Estate Commissioner, and Neil Menzies
from Edinburgh, a former ICI employee.
Council members will receive #3000 a year plus expenses for two to
three days work a month.
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said the council
would have few real powers to protect consumers against increases in
water charges and was no substitute for returning water to local
democratic control.

Who would want to live with the uncertainty that every time it rains
for a day or two the water floods in?
THE soothing words of Scottish Office minister George Kynoch had a
hollow ring for the residents of Fairyhill Road in Kilmarnock yesterday.
They were not interested in his deep concern or his insistence that
the regional council and not the Government was to blame for the second
serious flood in their street in less than a year.
Instead they wanted to know why they had been forced out of their
homes just months after they had returned from the previous deluge, why
they faced falling property prices and why they may find difficulty in
obtaining insurance cover.
Mr Kynoch made much of the fact that he had broken off a very
important meeting in Edinburgh to be with them as he arrived with his
Scottish Office minders and an entourage of local politicians of all
parties.
He talked to senior fire officers who had helped to evacuate dozens of
local people and were in charge of the mopping up operation after the
Kilmarnock water had subsided once again.
The Minister talked to local people who appeared shell shocked that
despite assurances the flood in December 1994 had been a freak they were
once again moving personal belongings and wondering what state their
homes would be in as the water receded.
Knots of people formed in the street as residents told their story and
politicians made their excuses but provided no answers to what was
causing a seemingly benign stretch of water rise and invade its
neighbours.
Mr Robin Pollock had spent the last week decorating the nursery for
the return from hospital of his wife Julie and baby son Andrew. He said:
''All the work was wasted yesterday as I watched the water rising and
spread quickly across the street and in the door.
''I only got back into the house in May after the last flood and we
thought we were getting back to normal. We were told that the last time
was a freak because of heavy rain and abnormal tides. What's the excuse
this time?
''The water was bubbling through the floorboards last night and has
ruined the carpet and the walls are now as damp as they were last time.
How can we bring a new baby into this?''
Neigbour Mrs Linda Tait has lived in the area for 50 years and has
never seen the Kilmarnock Water behave like it has twice within a year.
She said: ''In December the flooding was worse but that does not help.
It doesn't matter if you have two inches or two feet of water in your
house, the damage can be the same and the dampness can take months to
sort out.
''We are facing falling prices for our property. Who would want to
live with the uncertainty that every time it rains for a day or two the
water floods in? Worse than that people could face restrictions on
getting mortgages for the houses and may have insurance cover loaded or
refused altogether.''
Pensioners James and Mary Hannah were mopping up again and wondering
if it was worth staying in the home they have shared for decades. Mr
Hannah said: ''I am fed up hearing whose fault this is. We just want
something done. We pay our taxes and deserve a better deal than this.''
Mrs Hannah is convinced that the building of houses nearby, and a
retail park across the water, has contributed to the change in the water
course. She said: ''It has all started in the past two years since the
fields along the road were built on. The council should have looked more
closely at the possible consequences of allowing the builders to put in
their foundations and build their houses. The people in the new houses
are fine but we are the ones to suffer.''
The people of Ferryhill Road laughed as one at the suggestion that
flood prevention may be the responsbibility of the ''riparian owners''
-- those whose land borders on the river -- as suggested by a Scottish
Office official during talks with Strathclyde water services officials.
Mr Pollock said: ''That is a good one, not only are they telling us
that it is not their responsibility to stop our homes being flooded, now
they reckon it might be ours.''
The theories behind the the flooding range from building work through
silting of the river bed to changes in the tidal rivers nearby. What can
be done remains to be seen.
The discussions will go on and matters may become more complex before
they are settled. Meanwhile, the people of Fairyhill Road will live in
fear every time the rain comes on.

A ROW has erupted between Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch and
Strathclyde Regional Council over responsibility for flood prevention,
following the second crisis in ten months in Ayrshire and south Glasgow.
Mr Kynoch, minister for industry and local government, launched a
scathing attack on the region during a visit yesterday to flood victims
in Kilmarnock.
He said: ''I am most disapointed that nothing has been done in this
area to prevent a recurrence of the flooding. It is the responsibility
of the regional council and it appears they have been dragging their
heels.''
Senior councillors and officials hit back saying that their
responsibility was only a discretionary one and that the Scottish Office
had not made sufficient money available properly to address the
situation.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that the issue will become more complicated
next year when responsiblity for flood prevention will pass to the new
unitary authorities while cash for water and sewerage will go to the
water authorities.
Mr Kynoch had been invited to tour the Ferryhill Road area of
Kilmarnock, which was hit by floods on Thursday, by local MP Willie
McKelvey.
After meeting residents and traders, he promised to take the matter up
with the region but denied allegations of buck passing and insisted that
the responsibility lies with the region.
The Minister said: ''Strathclyde gets a lot of money directly from the
Scottish Office and has a large borrowing consent. It is up to the
council to identify priorities and allocate the money properly for
projects which are needed most.
''When the flooding occurred in various parts of Scotland last
December many authorities came forward with plans for flood prevention
which the Scottish Office is now considering support for by way of
grants. In the case of Kilmarnock no such scheme was put forward and I
am sure the people of this area would share my disappointment at that.
''I feel they have been let down by the regional council and I will be
making that point forcibly to the council.''
Local regional councillor John Blaney said that trying to point the
finger of blame would not help residents, adding: ''There is not enough
money in the region's coffers to carry out work of this kind.''
He joined Mr McKelvey, however, in pledging to push forward a full
survey of the problems caused by the Kilmarnock Water and the River
Irvine which it joins several miles away.
Mr McKelvey said: ''I am not pulling a rabbit out of the hat but I
have in my pocket details of a plan which would cost more than #50,000
to put through and that is only the survey of what is causing the
problem. I hope that all councils and agencies involved will chip in for
the survey.
''To put it right could cost millions and I have been told the region
does not have that kind of money available. The time has come to stop
arguing about who has responsibility and get on with easing the fears of
local people.''
Residents fear that building work on ''flood plains'' nearby may have
affected the flow of the water in recent years and have called for
better planning guidelines in such areas.
Mr Kynoch said: ''That is one aspect of this situation which I will be
asking my officials to look at closely. It may be that planning
guidelines are not strict enough.''
The Minister was accused last night of ''misrepresenting'' the
position of Strathclyde by finance chairman Councillor John Mullin. He
said: ''I wish to make it very clear that the council's existing flood
prevention powers are wholly discretionary. Because the power is not
mandatory, the Scottish Office does not reflect flood prevention in the
financial arangements for local authorities in Scotland.''
He said that the Scottish Office is empowered to pay for half of
schemes but the statutory procedures required may take several years.
Strathclyde region has only six months of life left.
Mr Mullin added: ''We would need between #100m and #200m to carry out
an effective flood prevention scheme programme and with our current
capital programme at #90m per annum we already face a #400m shortfall
over the next five years.
''That is a matter of merely meeting statutory obligations in regard
to water quality and treatment regulations. We sought more extensive
powers in 1991 and these were rejected.
''It is simply not credible to suggest that the council and its
successors could take on the extra #10m to #20m per annum needed over
the next decade to finance adequate flood prevention measures throughout
Strathclyde.''
Councillor Alex McLean, water and sewerage committte chairman, laid
the blame squarely on borrowing constraints linked with the limited life
of Strathclyde. He added: ''This council has done everything possible to
deal with the flooding problem and we have requested, without success,
the resources with which to deliver appropriate programmes.''
Mr Bill Gow, director of water services for Strathclyde, warned that
an already complicated situation will be made worse next April when the
water authorities and unitary councils swing into action.
He said: ''It is not clear what will happen but the unitary
authorities will take the notional responsibility for flood prevention
while I fear that the water authority will take all the budgets.
''I cannot see how the new authorities can be expected to cope when
the money is not there.''
Mr Gow called on the Scottish Office to make flood prevention the
responsibility of one body -- such as the Scottish Environmental
Protection Agency which will replace the river purification boards.
His call was echoed by Strathclyde East MEP Ken Collins who urged
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to ease the burden on local
authorities and to seek EU money if appropriate.

Beach photo enrages premier's wife.
Athens
ONE Greek publisher has been arrested and three others are in hiding
after their newspapers printed a picture allegedly showing the wife of
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in an intimate nude beach scene
with another woman.
All faces charges of ''unprovoked insult'' against Dimitra
Liani-Papandreou, 40. The Onoma and Avriani newspapers published the
photograph of her.
Avriani said it published the picture to force Liani-Papandreou to
withdraw from public life, while Onoma said it printed it to show it was
a fake.
Liani-Papandreou issued a statement denouncing the picture as a
fabrication and she had nothing but contempt for those involved in a
campaign against her.
''To today's outrageous fabrication, the peak of a filthy campaign of
political blackmail that a woman is going through, I can only answer
with my deepest contempt,'' she said.
''I could ask: 'Today it's me, tomorrow who else?' I hope to be the
last victim of an unrestrained campaign which is being falsely labelled
freedom of the press.''
Police arrested Makis Psomiadis, Onoma's publisher, and were searching
for three more publishers or chief editors involved in publishing the
picture.
Psomiadis was expected to go on trial tomorrow. If convicted, he could
face up to six months in jail for the misdemeanour but under Greek law
he can buy off the sentence.
Liani-Papandreou has enraged some members of Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement by appearing to be preparing the ground to enter
politics and stand for parliament.
A group of prominent socialists has complained that her ''inner
court'' has become too powerful and has effectively taken over the
running of the socialist party and the government.
Papandreou, 76, frail since heart surgery in 1988, has even been
forced to insist that he, not she, is in charge. He has also said he
would support her if she chose to run for office.
After the socialists won a big election victory in 1993, Liani became
director of his private office, organising his daily agenda and
controlling access to him.
Avriani said it wanted her to resign from her powerful post as chief
of staff to Papandreou and vowed to publish more nude pictures if she
did not.
Liani shocked many Greeks when she appeared at Papandreou's side
during the 1989 election campaign. Both of them were married to other
people at the time.
Government spokesman Tylemachos Hytiris described the picture as a
fake and part of a campaign to harm Papandreou and his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement.
Hytiris said the photograph surpassed ''every limit'' and was part of
a campaign of ''falsification, fakery, and fabrication, (and) one does
not even need to be an expert to see that''.
Liani shocked the nation when she started to appear at Papandreou's
side during the 1988 election campaign during a public adulterous
affair.
She has provoked deep rifts in the ruling socialist party since its
landslide election win in 1993 as she emerged as a political force.
Avriani's nude picture campaign sent its circulation soaring to more
than 80,000 from 10,000 and it was expected to sell more than 100,000
copies today.--Reuter.

GOVERNMENT health officials yesterday said there was ''nothing
sinister'' about the latest case of a teenager contracting the human
equivalent of mad cow disease.
However, a committee advising the Government on Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD) called for further investigation into the case of the
16-year-old schoolgirl and the death of a 19-year-old youth.
The unnamed girl is the second teenager to contract CJD in Britain in
the last two years.
Mr Stephen Churchill, 19, from Devizes, Wiltshire, died in May -- a
year after developing the illness.
The case of the schoolgirl, believed to be seriously ill but still
alive, was revealed in a letter to the Lancet medical journal by
scientists researching CJD.
Yesterday, the Department of Health said it was following the advice
of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that no
conclusions could be drawn from the cases of the teenagers.
A spokesman said: ''We don't think there is anything sinister about it
at all.''
The latest Government figures on CJD show that incidence of the
disease rose in the UK last year from 42 cases to 55.

THE sound of bagpipes which were last heard 250 years ago in the heat
of the Battle of Culloden, echoed above the lonely moor again yesterday.
The last time the instrument was played in earnest, the music was a
prelude to massacre. Cumberland's Redcoats crushed Bonnie Prince
Charlie's ill-fated Jacobites.
Yesterday, the pipes returned to the exact spot where the McGregor
piper sounded the Atholl Brigade battle charge.
Former Battlefield Band piper, Mr Dougie Pincock, was given the honour
of performing the musical event as filming began for part of a BBC TV
documentary, The Big Blaw, to be screened on St Andrew's Night.
Mr Pincock will present the one-off show, charting the development of
the bagpipe through to the present day.
Ever since they were last played by piper John McGregor, the bagpipes
have been preserved at Blair Castle.
Programme producer Jim Hunter revealed it had taken careful
negotiation with the Duke of Atholl to secure their use for filming.
Mr Hunter said: ''The pipes have been lying at the castle since 1745.
The duke was anxious to protect what is a very valuable relic.
''It is entirely a one-off event. The pipes are showing signs of wear
and tear and I understand this is the last time they will be played
publicly.
''They have not been played in public since the Battle of Culloden,
although they were re-bagged and tested privately in 1987 before an
exhibition at the castle.''
Quite different from modern bagpipes, John MacGregor's set is smaller
and has only two drones.
The bitter memory of defeat in the Battle of Culloden, the cruel
reprisals on Highland clans in the aftermath, and the infamous Highland
Clearances during the next 150 years clearly lives on among local folk.
When the film crew arrived yesterday, they found a wreath had been
laid at the spot where John McGregor had sounded his charge.
Mr Hunter added: ''It was a lovely wee touch. We have no idea who was
responsible but it shows people up here still remember those, like John,
who perished in the battle.''
Mr Pincock, said he was honoured to have been given the opportunity to
be a part of a piece of Highland history.
''To think that I had in my hands an instrument last played at the
last pitched battle on British soil was quite amazing. And the fact that
they may never be played again only added to my sense of awe.''

MORE than 100 people were evacuated from homes and shops yesterday
after chemical drums leaked from a van in Aberdeenshire.
Police and fire teams sealed off the centres of two towns as
specialist chemical units tried to contain the spillage.
The van driver realised the drums were leaking as he drove through
Inverurie. He pulled into the forecourt of the fire station and alerted
firefighters that the chemical, Phenolic, was leaking.
The area was immediately sealed off and residents and shop workers
were evacuated to the town hall for four hours.
The driver of the courier van was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary
after some of the chemical spilled on to his hands.
The centre of Turriff, 22 miles away, was closed for a short time
after it was discovered that the driver had dropped off a package,
contaminated by the chemical, at a department store.
Police said one store employee who had handled the package was taken
to hospital. He was allowed home last night.
Phenolic is related to carbolic acid, a highly corrosive chemical
which is potentially fatal through skin contact or if ingested.

A POLICE constable was fined #100 at Haddington Sheriff Court
yesterday for alarming shoe sales staff by stalking a store for four
months.
Gordon Montgomery, 39, a father of two, has been suspended by Lothian
and Borders Police since last Christmas and now faces disciplinary
action.
The former Queen's Own Highlanders bandsman was found guilty of breach
of the peace.
He was told by Sheriff Marcus Green: ''You are a man of exemplary
character. I can't understand what drove you to this conduct.''
Montgomery, of Stoneyhill Terrace, Musselburgh, looked stunned by the
verdict.
He denied on various occasions between June and November 28 last year
in Musselburgh and Fisherrow Co-operative, High Street, Musselburgh,
having conducted himself in a disorderly manner and repeatedly stared at
female staff to their alarm and apprehension.
Montgomery, who has 12 years police service, told the court that it
was a case of mistaken identity.
He said that some people thought he looked similar to another man said
to have a sexual fetish for shoes. ''I am not the man who was in the
shop,'' he claimed.

UKTV and Virgin Television, bitter losers in the battle to control
Britain's fifth terrestrial channel, may seek a judicial review
following yesterday's decision by the the Independent Television
Commission to award the franchise to Channel 5 Broadcasting, the
business consortium led by the Pearson Group.
Such a move, either by one or both of the unsuccessful bidders, would
almost certainly mean that the planned starting date for the new channel
-- January 1, 1997 -- would have to be put back.
The ITC's final choice, which surprised the broadcasting industry, was
made, not on financial considerations but on the grounds of programme
quality.
It is perhaps significant, not to mention promising, that Channel 5
Broadcasting was the only one of the four contenders specifically to
mention Scotland in its lengthy tender document to the ITC.
Although it has no immediate plans to transmit separate services to
different parts of the country, the new company has announced its
longer-term intention to produce tailor-made broadcasting for certain
regions. The first will probably be Scotland.
''We are certain that such a service, understanding and drawing upon
the distinctive character of Scotland and the Scots and reflecting its
educational, legal, and commercial differences from the rest of Britain,
will be welcomed by viewers,'' declared the document.
The commission said it had not been satisfied with the proposals
outlined by UKTV or Virgin. Channel 5 Broadcasting (C5B), whose bid was
masterminded by Mr Greg Dyke, former boss at TVAM, was the only tender
judged to be suitable.
Before yesterday's announcement, UKTV (which began as the rank
outsider in the race) was being tipped heavily to win. The Canadian-led
consortium had made by far the highest bid -- #36m -- and, on the
surface, it appeared to pass the quality threshold.
In a somewhat curious coincidence, the bids placed by Virgin and C5B
were identical to the last penny -- #22,002,000. A fourth bid of just
#2m from Rupert Murdoch's New Century Television Ltd, was always
considered to be a non-runner. Unlike the other losers, however, it did
pass the quality criteria.
Both UKTV and Virgin were seriously unhappy with yesterday's
announcement. UKTV chairman John Whitney said: ''We are extremely
disappointed.''
Mr David Asper, a director of CanWest, the principal partner in the
consortium, said: ''Considering that we were the highest bid and are
confident that we exceeded every other threshold, our group will be
meeting shortly to review the decision and consider our position.''
Virgin Television accused the ITC of opting for a format too similar
to the existing four channels. It also rejected the commission's
criticism that it had failed to show evidence of a wide enough range of
programme suppliers.
Privately, the ITC is anticipating that at least one of the
disappointed bidders will probably seek a judicial review through the
English courts. However, the ITC remains confident that it can justify
its decision.
One commission insider said that the programme proposals put forward
by both Virgin and UKTV had been ''extremely poor'' and fell a long way
short of what was expected. UKTV relied too strongly on drama serials
and entertainment and half of its output would be repeats. The only
factual programming it proposed, apart from news, was between 7pm and
8pm on a Sunday.
Virgin's problem was that it could not guarantee a sufficiently
diverse range of programming or a properly resourced news service.
C5B's successful bid promises a wide range of programmes including
news, drama, current affairs, sport, arts, and religion, with an
emphasis on leisure and learning.
The commission will issue the 10-year licence to C5B in 12 weeks but
this could be extended if the failed bidders seek recourse through the
courts.
The new station is intending to open, ahead of schedule, in the autumn
of next year. Its ''big bang'' theory is to start up in all areas at the
same time, as opposed to staggering the launch over the year. However,
the channel will be available to only about 60% to 70% of the UK. In
Scotland, around 3,037,000 viewers are expected to receive it.
Between now and the date, C5B will have to arrange the re-tuning of
video recorders in up to 15 million homes nationwide because the new
channel's frequency will interfere with reception for the recorders. The
operation will cost the new broadcasters between #50m and #150m.
It will also mean that a number of homes in Britain will be forced to
buy new aerials in order to receive Channel Five.
The success against the odds of C5B, which involves the Pearson Group,
owners of the Financial Times; MAI, which holds existing ITV franchises
for Meridian and Anglia; and Luxembourg's CLT, is largely down to one
man. Mr Greg Dyke, currently Pearson's chief executive, is one of the
leading figures in broadcasting, formerly head of LWT.
He said after yesterday's announcement: ''When the fax came in with
the news, I thought, 'I have been here before'. We read the Act very
carefully and we were without doubt diverse in our application.''
He said the new channel would endeavour to reach different audiences
at different times of the day. News would be provided by ITN and it
would have a more European bias. C5B, he admitted, would be able to
produce only a limited amount of original drama and it would have its
share of repeats (taken from the libraries of the BBC, Thames, and
Anglia). It will also feature a five-day-a-week soap opera made by
Grundy Television, which makes Neighbours.
C5B is now going ahead with its plan to spend #200m on the
establishment of the channel.
Scotland's distinct national identity -- and the prospect of a future
Scottish political assembly -- clearly makes it odds-on favourite to
benefit early from any decision to regionalise the Channel Five service.
Meantime, C5B has stressed it will be pushing for Scottish production
companies to contribute programme ideas for the new service.
''We want local film-makers to make programmes about their own areas
which will be shown right across the channel.''
Who will receive the new channel in Scotland? Well, according to the
ITC, more than three million viewers, about 62%, will be able to tune
in.
In general terms, the entire central belt will get it, as will the
Borders, the east coast, the South-west, and Inverness. Only the far
North, the North-west, and the islands will be unable to receive the
service.
Some viewers will have to invest in new aerials because of the
possibility of interference but most Scottish viewers (2.2 million) are
covered by the Blackhill transmitter, between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and
they should be able to get the new channel on their existing aerials.

SECRETARY of State Michael Forsyth will be told shortly by a statutory
transport watchdog body that some kind of ferry service should be run as
an alternative to the Skye bridge.
The Caledonian MacBrayne users consultative committee hosted a public
meeting in Kyle of Lochalsh yesterday afternoon when the message was
made clear that there was still a need for a ferry, even if the bridge
was toll free.
The first thing that chairman Mrs Helen Miller was told, however, was
that she should not be holding the meeting at that time and at that
place. It should have been in an evening on Skye where the strength of
feeling on the issue of the bridge tolls might have meant hundreds
attending.
In the end, 40 people did make it to the meeting and they made it
clear to the committee that there were serious concerns over the safety
of the bridge, particularly in high winds.
Mrs Miller advised the meeting to consider setting up a bridge users'
group to take up these and other issues with the bridge operators, Skye
Bridge Limited.
Mrs Pam Noble, secretary of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said: ''We
don't have the power of other consumers because we can't withdraw from
the bridge, because we have no alternative now.''
Mrs Miller accepted this point and made it clear that the committee
would be recommending some sort of ferry service when it exercised its
statutory right to submit recommendations to the Secretary of State.
Inevitably the meeting was dominated by the fact that the people of
Skye were having to pay the highest tolls in Europe on the bridge, at
#5.20 in the summer and #4.50 in the winter.

THE Act setting up a Scottish parliament will offer unprecedented
guarantees which will strengthen the position of local government not
diminish it, Labour's new devolution spokesman John McAllion promised
yesterday.
It will commit the parliament to maintaining a strong and effective
system of local government and will embody the principle of
subsidiarity.
This meant decisions would be taken as closely as possible to the
people they affected he said. This was a guarantee, which did not exist
at present, that a vast number would be made at local government level.
Making his first major speech since being given the the task by Labour
of promoting the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals, Mr
McAllion said a Scottish parliament would have no intention of trying to
take over the running of water and sewerage services which the
Government had handed over to three quangos.
A Labour Government would clear out the Government appointees on the
boards and put them under the control of elected councillors who could
consider the best way to run the services.
The Labour Front spokesman warned a Unison/Labour Party conference in
Edinburgh that those who opposed the parliament would do everything they
could to drive a wedge between it and local government.
Mr Mark Irvine, Unison's head of local government in Scotland, told
the conference that local government must not be complacent about its
relationship with a future Scottish parliament.
Some people might lobby to draw up powers from councils, whether over
education or social services, and the unions would have to band together
with others to ensure that did not happen.

HOSPITALS should take a much more vigorous approach to giving children
pain relief, a conference was told yesterday.
Professor Neil McIntosh, of the Department of Child Life and Health at
Edinburgh University, said: ''As recently as 10 years ago, we were
getting major operations without any pain relief at all. The thinking
was that they had laughing gas as an anaesthetic and therefore could not
feel pain.''
He said subsequent studies had demonstrated that children suffered
pain from birth and beforehand. It could be measured by increased heart
rate and hormonal changes in addition to more obvious signs like changes
in feeding and sleeping patterns and crying.
Professor McIntosh said that while children's hospitals were good at
providing pain relief, general hospitals were often worried about
offering this for very small children, often on the unwarranted
assumption that there was a risk of addiction in the use of morphine and
related drugs.
''I think pain relief should be something at the top of the list of
considerations rather than an afterthought.
''Pain has been very much under-rated in all children but particularly
in children of the neo-natal period. In fact, they may actually be
supersensitive to pain,'' he told a conference in Edinburgh, part of the
centenary celebrations for the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Dr Patricia McGrath, of the University of Western Ontario and
chairwoman of the paediatric group of the International Association for
the Study of Pain, said use of opiod drugs was only part of the weaponry
to control pain.

<TEXT>
By Our Political Reporter
CONSERVATIVE Party chairman Brian Mawhinney reinforced the
Government's pre-election shift to the right last night with a blunt
warning that Britain should accept isolation from Europe if it is in the
national interest.
His emphasis on going it alone if the rest of the European Union
continues on the path to greater European integration will be welcome by
the Tory Euro-sceptic right, which is pressing the Government to adopt a
distinctly anti-European stance.
His speech, to Conservatives in the Prime Minister's Huntingdon
constituency, also confirms the Government's intention to take on Labour
over Europe and make it a central election issue.
Dr Mawhinney said that Government policy should be based on the
interests of Britain and on ''what is right for our people''. Labour, he
said, was prepared to sacrifice the national interest in exchange for
winning favour in Brussels.
However, his distinctly uncompromising tone was yesterday contradicted
by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, who sought to undo the damage of
his harshly nationalist speech to the Tory conference two weeks ago by
denying he was anti-European.
Mr Portillo rejected suggestions that his speech, in which he invoked
the SAS to warn Brussels ''don't mess with Britain'', was at odds with
the Government over Europe. ''I expressed the Government's fervent
opposition to the creation of a European super state,'' he said.
''I stick resolutely to what I said and the Government, and this is
the important point, sticks resolutely to its commitment that Britain
will not enter a European superstate as long as there is a Conservative
government. I am certainly not anti-European -- I am half Spanish
myself. What I am is anti-federalist.''
Dr Mawhinney accused Labour leader Tony Blair of being ''prepared to
sacrifice Britain's interests for the hollow cheers of those who are
competitors as well as our partners.''
''When faced with a choice between courting popularity with our
partners and doing what is best for our people, Tony Blair will put his
wish to be liked before the interests of Britain,'' he said.
''True leadership is about facing the possibility of isolation if
ultimately that is what our national interests demands. True leadership
ocasionally requires saying no when others want to move ahead, if that
is what is right for our people.''

FIVE men, aged from 19 to 26, were arrested in the Edinburgh area
yesterday in a joint police operation in connection with the disturbance
which developed as boxer James Murray lay dying in the ring.
The arrests followed a series of dawn swoops involving officers from
Strathclyde Police assisted by officers from the Lothian and Borders
force.
The joint action came after a two-week investigation into the scenes
at the Hospitality Inn in Glasgow on Friday, October 13.
Detectives are understood to have studied press photographs and TV
film footage of the scenes at the hotel when fighting broke out among
rival spectators as James Murray lay stricken on the canvas.
The Newmains boxer died of a brain injury the Sunday after collapsing
during his challenge for the British bantamweight title.
Strathclyde Police confirmed that five men were the subject of a
report to the procurator-fiscal at Glasgow in connection with a
disturbance at the fight.
It is understood the men were detained under Section 2 of the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 and were taken to police offices in
Edinburgh, where they were charged but later released.
The Act allows police six hours to question suspects after which they
must be released or charged.
The Herald understands that further arrests are likely in connection
with the incident.
A spokesman for the procurator-fiscal's office in Glasgow said no
police report on the incident had yet been received.
The details of any report would have to be studied before a decision
was made on what action, if any, to take, making an early court
appearance for those arrested unlikely.

THE Scottish National Party attempted to bolster the economic case for
independence with a report yesterday which estimated that 11,500 jobs
could be created if Scotland became independent.
The employers' organisation, CBI Scotland, was more sceptical,
suggesting the report failed to take into account possible job losses
caused by the uncertainty during the transition from being part of the
UK to stand-alone government.
The report was commissioned from economic consultants Mackay
Consultants, who looked at the economies of similar small European
countries such as Ireland, Denmark, and Norway.
The basic premise adopted by Mackay's is that foreign embassies would
be attracted to Edinburgh once it had its own decision-making parliament
and that Government jobs at present in England would be relocated to
Scotland.
Running the parliament itself would mean about 400 jobs. Creating
departments such as Treasury, and a Foreign Office, and expanding
Energy, Industry and Agriculture departments would mean a further 1100
jobs.
Although this may seem an undue burden on the Scottish taxpayer, the
SNP insists that these jobs already are paid by the Scottish taxpayer to
be carried out in England, so the overall cost would be small.
Embassies and consulates could bring a further 350 to 400 jobs, and
the European Union probably would be prevailed to site one of its
subsidiary agencies in Scotland with a further 300 to 400 jobs.
Taking a lead from what has happened in Ireland and Norway,
broadcasting and film activity would increase bringing a further 400 to
500 jobs.
Taking a rough mid-point from the total of these estimates gives a
figure of 2600 which can be multiplied by 1.75 to give a figure of 4550
jobs. This is not just a figure plucked out of the air. Economists say
that every full-time job helps create other work.
Mackay Consultants also looked at the private sector, and here the
estimates become slightly more speculative. However if one accepts that
Scotland having its own energy department issuing licenses for oil and
gas exploration would attract more jobs from the oil companies, then it
can be argued that such Government activity, plus similar ventures in
other areas, would attract some 7000 additional jobs in the private
sector.
Politicians from other parties have argued that the disruption and
uncertainty caused by independence would actually drive jobs away. The
Mackay Consultants report states that they doubt that would happen, but
concedes: ''Much would depend on the policy and fiscal initiatives which
were pursued by a Scottish Government after independence.''
Asked for his reaction, Mr Lex Gold, director, CBI Scotland, said it
was not his place to comment on the politics of independence, but argued
that the report appeared to ignore the likely disruption.''One thing
that companies do not like is uncertainty, which could lead to a number
of companies relocating elsewhere,'' he said.

SPORT Minister Iain Sproat warned yesterday about Britain's young
people becoming a nation of ''couch potatoes''.
Mr Sproat condemned current provision for sport in some schools as
''grossly inadequate''.
During a Commons debate on sport, he said the average 14-year-old
spent only one hour a week on physical education lessons.
He contrasted this with an estimated television viewing time for some
youngsters of 25 hours a week.
''We want to get sport back at the heart of school life,'' he told
MPs.
Mr Sproat pointed to research by the British Heart Foundation which
said ''we now had the most unfit generation ever -- bringing up a
generation of couch potatoes.
''The armed forces find it extremely difficult when they get new
recruits and find they can't even march more than a couple of miles in
heavy boots because they haven't had enough exercise at school.''
Recruits to fire stations too had been found not to have sufficient
''upper body strength''.
His warning came soon soon after Shadow Education and Employment
Secretary David Blunkett said children over seven should be encouraged
to spend half-an-hour a night doing homework instead of sitting watching
TV.

<TEXT>
FORD yesterday dealt a blow to Essex Man and boy racers everywhere by
scrapping the 140mph Escort Cosworth.
The #24,000 to 28,000 model, last of the Cosworth family, has been
deemed by the EU to be too noisy.
Technology needed to make it quieter would be uneconomic to Ford.
The Cosworth will be phased out early next year, 11 years after the
first of the range was launched.
Cosworth is the engineering company which built the engine, firstly
for rally use and later for a limited edition road car.
The Sierra Cosworth was launched in 1985 and phased out around 1992.
Then there was the Sapphire Cosworth and, three years ago, the Escort
was launched.
It has since sold around 1500 but with only 250 sales so far this year
it is not worth the expense of making it quieter.
The main noise comes from the tyres, which are wider than on most
cars. Even at 50-60mph they help give the car its trademark roaring
sound.
A spokesman for Ford said: ''It was too noisy for Brussels and it did
not match exhaust emission legislation either.
''It will still exist as a rally car which it was designed for in the
first place.''
The Cosworth will be missed by the same drivers who mourned the death
of the Capri and the XR seriesbut the spokesman added: ''Ford promises
that we are not backing out of the performance cars market.''
The company expects a rush of orders for the last few Cosworths to be
produced at the Karmann plant in Germany.

A NEW Scottish council has agreed to spend #20,000 to complete the
design of a new logo for itself while it is also looking for a new coat
of arms and a crest.
That is not counting the cost of the official notepaper that Highland
Council will need . . . last year, Highland region issued six million
headed sheets.
Nor does it cover the cost of ensuring that the Inverness-based
council's ''corporate image'' is displayed on all its vehicles.
The council's offices and factory units will all be getting new signs
with the new logo . . . with Gaelic getting an assured place, although
less than one in five of the council's taxpayers speak the language.
Yesterday, Councillor Isobel Rhind, of Invergordon, reckoned that the
whole change-over exercise could cost around #100,000.
She said: ''This council is supposed to be so short of money over the
next two years that I think we surely need to be more careful before
spending this amount.''
The logo which is supposed to ''reflect the quality, culture, and
environment of the Highlands'' will be based on a heather purple. It
shows eight triangles which, according to Mr McCourt, ''emphasises the
eight areas of the council's administration in an imaginative way'',
with the title in English at the top and Gaelic at the bottom.
The design will be completed by public relations company Michael
Fraser Associates, of Ardersier, near Inverness, and they will also
undertake an audit of the places where it should be used . . . and
produce a manual of guidelines for the council's corporate identity.
Yesterday, the council's new #70,000-a-year chief executive, Mr Arthur
McCourt, told councillors in an report that ''the whole management of
the project, including liason with printers, sign-writers, etc is
complex''.
His report came as the council launched a contest for the design of a
coat of arms and a crest for itself.
These have to be registered with the Edinburgh-based Lord Lyon King of
Arms -- and that could set the council taxpayers back another #1000.
However, the coat of arms and the crest should come cheaper than the
logo.Schoolchildren and college students, and people interested in
heraldry as a hobby, will get a chance to enter the competition.
Four professional design companies were asked to come up with ideas
for the logo.
The official unveiling of the new logo, coat of arms, and the crest
will all take place in March next year -- just before the new council
officially becomes the local government for the 210,000 people in what
is currently Highland region.
After the meeting, convener Councillor Peter Peacock, of Ardersier,
said: ''This is one of the costs of local government re-organisation.
No-one asked for the changeover from the old districts and region . . .
the Government forced it on the old councils.''
He added: ''This is what reform costs if it is to be done properly.''

JACK CUNNINGHAM, the senior Labour spokesman who did not quite make it
on to the Shadow Cabinet but was given a job anyway, at least has a
sense of humour.
In the debate on the national lottery the other day, he was mocked by
Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley about, as she put it, the ups and
downs of politics.
He retorted: ''I have given a lot of thought to lotteries over the
past seven days. But as a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party and
Newcastle United I am well used to dealing with both triumph and
disaster. It is just that the disasters have been a bit too frequent
lately.''
Tasty Clydeside?
OVER to their lordships, who are taking a keen interest in the plight
of Lanarkshire farmer Humphrey Errington and his manufacture of Lanark
Blue cheese.
Lord Peston, chairman of the Lords' refreshement department, wants Mr
Errington to get in touch with him because ever since he heard of the
case he has been keen that some of the cheese should be available to
peers.
As he put it: ''I do not believe that our lives would be placed at
risk and it would be a good supportive gesture if people of our age
showed how good the cheese is and how safe it is to eat.''
Government Minister Lord Lucas admitted to having eaten the stuff, but
was pulled up by Lord (Harry) Ewing of Kirkford, for confusing Clydeside
with Clydesdale.
Lord Ewing: ''For the sake of the accuracy of the record, may I be
permitted to advise the Minister that in Clydeside we build ships, and
we could do with more orders from the Government. The cheese is made in
Clydesdale, not in Clydeside.''
Lord Lucas: ''I stand educated. I had always thought that Clydesdale
was a type of horse.''
Low spirits
IT IS that time of year again. Yes, the build-up to the Budget with
the Scotch Whisky Association firing on all cylinders about whisky tax
and so on. Hence a seminar at Parliament attended by the great and the
good from the drinks trade.
Those in attendance included Mr Hugh Morison, director-general of the
Scotch Whisky Association, Richard Maude Roxby, chairman of the
wonderfully-named Drive Down Duty Group, and Clive Wilkinson, who is
lucky enough to be director of the Gin and Vodka Association.
We learn that Keith Boyfield, author of the Adam Smith Institute's
''Too Much to Swallow,'' opened the proceedings by displaying various
spirits he had bought in Italy, all of which were between a third and a
half of the UK price. It is not recorded whether those assembled
adjourned for a drink afterwards, or whether they simply settled for
cracking open the Italian produce.
On wild cat trail
NEVER mind the Beast of Bodmin Moor. SNP leader Alex Salmond, with his
usual eye on Scotland getting its fair share of expenditure, wants to
know whether the Scottish Office will conduct an investigation into the
existence of a large wild cat in Banffshire.
What resources, he would like to know, is the Secretary of State
prepared to allocate to determine whether there is a threat to livestock
in the area?.
The Scottish Office remains aloof. Scottish Secretrary Michael Forsyth
insists that his department maintains contact with Grampian police who,
with the advice of veterinary and zoology experts, have examined
reported incidents. Sadly, the evidence found so far involves dogs and
foxes only.
SNP coup
UNEXPECTED elevation for the SNP's parliamentary leader Margaret
Ewing, the new Secretary of State for Scotland. She was sent a letter
the other day addressed to Margaret Ewing MP, The Scottish Office, Dover
House, Whitehall, London.
The city limit
PAISLEY MP Gordon McMaster is wondering whether Paisley should attain
city status. No, according to the Government. The bad news is that city
status in Scotland can only be achieved through the granting of a Royal
Burgh Charter which, confusingly, has no statutory significance in
Scotland.
According to Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, no
Royal Burgh Charter has been granted in modern times and there are no
plans to revive the practice.

''This is an example of a dream Tory railway in which Lord Sterling
travels free and the rest of us subsidise him''
SHIPPING chief Lord Sterling yesterday defended the decision to allow
him to escape a rail penalty ticket fine.
Amid fury from Labour and passenger groups, the P&amp;O chairman said he
''should never have been put in the position'' of being given a penalty
fine for boarding a train without a ticket.
Lord Sterling said that only long queues at London's Waterloo station
had prevented his buying a ticket and he had no intention of travelling
without paying.
Critics of the incident included regular rail user Peter Gardner, 39,
of St Mary's Road, Oxford.
He was given a #10 penalty ticket and failed in his appeal against it
after claiming long queues often built up at his Oxford station.
In Lord Sterling's case, he was given a penalty notice last month
after failing to show a ticket when travelling on a South West Trains
service from London to Haslemere in Surrey.
Lord Sterling explained his predicament to South West Trains managing
director Peter Field.
Lord Sterling said last night that Mr Field had written to him saying:
''I have arranged for the matter to be removed from our records and you
will not be troubled by us further.''
According to documents obtained by Labour transport spokesman Brian
Wilson, Mr Field had told the Penalty Fares Office that it was
''probably not appropriate'' to demand payment.
Mr Field's letter went on: ''I would be obliged if you could delete on
your computer and records all reference to this notice.''
In a handwritten postscript, Mr Field added: ''You may have guessed
that the person concerned would find this matter extremely
embarrassing.''
South West Trains said yesterday: ''We do not feel Lord Sterling was
singled out for special treatment.''
Mr Wilson said yesterday: ''This is an example of a dream Tory railway
in which Lord Sterling travels free and the rest of us subsidise him.''
Mr Doug Hoyle, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, said: ''So
there is one law for the privileged and one for the ordinary person, is
there?
''It is absolutely disgraceful and a scandal that the rail authorities
are taking this view.
Rail passenger watchdog body, the Central Rail Users' Consultative
Committee, said yesterday: ''There certainly have been cases where
people have been fined that shouldn't have been.
A spokesman added: ''The whole rigour of the regulations should not be
brought down on people who contravene the rules inadvertently.''
* The BR Passengers Charter says the standard for ticket office
service is that travellers should not have to wait more than five
minutes at any time.

<HEADLINE>New theory in cot deaths</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>GRAEME SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975667455</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RESEARCHERS are exploring the possibility that one cause of cot deaths
-- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome -- could be babies' defence mechanisms
going out of control and damaging rather than protecting.
This theory was discussed yesterday at a meeting in Aberdeen at which
experts funded by the Scottish Cot Death Trust presented their work to
other experts in the field.
The number of cot deaths in Scotland has dropped dramatically in the
past five years, from 130 annually to 50.
''However, that is still one apparently normal baby dying every week
in Scotland and that is a tragedy for a family when it happens,'' said
Professor Peter Helms of the department of child health at Aberdeen
University.
He said the progress was pleasing but that it was still the largest
single cause of death in babies from one month to a year old.
''The cause is still unknown despite all the work groups like the
Scottish Cot Death Trust and others have supported,'' said Prof Helms.
''We still are looking for a cause and it is likely there will be a
constellation of causes that come together to result in this tragedy for
families.''
0 It is now also undisputed that smoking is a major factor and
statistics suggest that smoking during pregnancy multiplies seven times
the risk of a baby suffering a cot death, with the risks increased even
further if both parents smoke.
''Smoking doesn't cause cot deaths but it is a contributory factor,''
Professor Helm said.
''There are people in socially deprived areas still saying, 'Yes, I
know smoking will mean a smaller baby but I want a smaller baby -- it
will be less painful'.''
The professor added that the most common time for cot deaths was
around two months so there appeared to be something about the
development of the baby at that time which made it vulnerable.
''We have some information that some babies are suffering damage in
the womb, not growing properly, possibly relating to what subsequently
appears as immature control mechanisms and there has been a suggestion
that might be linked with smoking in pregnancy.
''The deaths may be caused by the inborn factor coming up against
factors in the environment at the wrong time.
''If there are factors which cause inborn problems which we cannot do
anything about, at least we might be able to identify babies who have a
high risk and perhaps do something by more intervention, by watching
these babies more carefully, by more attention to detail, to reduce the
deaths.''
He said it might not be the infection, bacterial or viral, which
caused the problem but the way the baby responded.
''The normal defence mechanism may get slightly out of control, be
slightly exaggerated, and turn out to be damaging rather than
protective.''
Dr Angus Gibson, chairman of the Scottish Cot Death Trust, said:
''What is particularly hard for those parents who lose children through
cot deaths is that very many of them were actually following the
recommendations about sleep position.''

RATIONING health care in Scotland will continue to be the
responsibility of local health boards, the NHS management executive said
yesterday.
It said no meeting was planned or had taken place along the lines of a
secret conference organised last month by the management executive for
England and Wales.
According to a newspaper report, doctors and officials took the first
steps towards establishing a national framework for rationing National
Health Service treatments -- or ''priority setting'', as the Government
prefers to call it, leading to accusations by Labour that the Government
was determined to ''end the NHS''.
The day-long conference in September was addressed by Mr Ron Zimmer,
director of public health for Cambridge and Huntingdon health commission
-- the authority which denied treatment to 11-year-old leukemia sufferer
Jaymee Bowen.
It was initiated by the NHS Executive and held jointly with the Royal
College of Physicians and the British Medical Association.
According to a note on the conference, the broadcaster Nick Ross, who
was brought in to chair the event, says: ''There was complete agreement
that rationing is inevitable. Everyone agreed there should be a
framework and that there must be three levels of decision making:
national, local, and individual.''
However, he warned that the implications were ''explosive'' and
questioned politicians' willingness to take hard decisions. Mr Ross
asks: ''For example, there are plainly good grounds to cease providing
homeopathy via the NHS but will any Minister bite the bullet on his or
her own account?''
Labour's health spokeswoman Harriet Harman said: ''This is further
evidence of the Government's drive to privatise the NHS. The Government
wants to cut back treatments in the NHS and force people to go private.
This is not rationing, it's privatisation.
''Private health care is more expensive and available only to those
who can pay rather than those who need the treatment.
''The Government is clearly determined to end the NHS. The NHS has no
future with an increasingly right-wing Government. The question will not
be 'do you need treatment, can you benefit from treatment?' but instead
'can you pay for treatment?'.''
According to the report, the secretary of the BMA, Dr Mac Armstrong,
said priority setting was the one issue which had divided the doctors at
a recent session to review the profession's core values.
Yesterday, Dr Armstrong was attending a conference in South Africa but
a BMA spokesman said: ''We have always taken the view that, if we are
going to ration then there should be more open public discussion.
Obviously we would like to fight for more money but inevitably there
will be a limit and difficult decisions will have to be made.''
Recent developments which are forcing choices on the health service
range on the one hand from Interferon Beta, which is said to protect
some multiple sclerosis victims from relapse at a possible cost of #8000
a year, to minor cosmetic surgery operations.

Talks next Monday on future of two biggest arts spenders.
The reaction of the two companies was predictably guarded. Neither
would entertain the word 'merger'
MICHAEL Forsyth romped centre stage yesterday into the Scottish Opera
epic, bypassing his appointed mandarins, the Scottish Arts Council, and
producing a ballet company from his hat.
He asked Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet to discuss shared
facilities.
He is not hanging about. The first meeting of the two companies,
convened by Lord Lindsay, Minister for the Arts, will take place next
Monday.
The Secretary of State said that both companies were prominent among
Scotland's cultural assets. He wanted to see them flourish -- but on
present funding.
The reaction of the two companies was predictably guarded. Neither
would entertain the word ''merger''. Neither would openly discuss the
fact that, once again, if there is a sacrifice to be made, it will be an
orchestra.
In attempts over the last three years to resolve the financial crisis
of Scottish Opera, its supposedly underused orchestra has been coupled
(on paper) with almost every orchestra in the country except the Jimmy
Shand Dance Band.
This time, it could be the Scottish Ballet orchestra which faces the
axe, solving overnight the so-called problem of underuse of the opera
orchestra.
Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, was plainly
delighted at the intervention of the Secretary of State (especially
following his obvious recent frustration with the Scottish Arts Council,
which would not make the case for his company to the Scottish Office).
There was a suspicion in some quarters yesterday that one reason for
Mr Forsyth's sudden materialisation centre stage had been to administer
a smacked wrist to the arts council (the shady character from the east).
SAC certainly looked consigned to the wings without a role.
''There's a lot to talk about,'' said Mr Jarman, referring to ''areas
of affinity'' between the two companies. ''We're in similar kinds of
entertainment, we both use theatres, similar structures, costume, and
orchestras.''
He said the campaign to save Scottish Opera, which last week brought a
contribution of #100,000 to an emergency fund from the Royal Bank of
Scotland, would be put on the back burner. There was now a need for a
''swift and urgent'' resolution, he said.
Scottish Ballet, perhaps seeing a looming threat to its autonomy, was
more circumspect, pointing out that the two companies already had a
close relationship: the ballet uses the Theatre Royal (owned by Scottish
Opera) and the opera company's trucks when on tour.
''We buy in our scenery from other places,'' said a ballet
spokeswoman. ''Perhaps we could get it made in Scottish Opera's
workshops. Beyond that, nobody's sure what areas of common interest
there are.''
A representative of the ballet orchestra, which is bound to see itself
as under threat, said that though the orchestra was freelance, there was
''great loyalty'' from its players, who return regularly, and who
receive about 24 weeks of employment a year from Scottish Ballet.
The ballet company also pointed out that, in the most recent report
into collaborations, it was argued that there was not enough common
ground between the two companies to offer mutual advantage: clashes of
seasons, different operating practices and artistic requirements, all
leading to the conclusion that ''such a solution would neither deliver
sufficient opera and ballet to meet current public demand''.
The unions were a bit more forthcoming, with Equity giving a cautious
welcome to the proposed collaboration, especially if it ensured the
employment of the chorus of Scottish Opera and the 40 dancers of
Scottish Ballet.
Equity pointed to European models of combined opera and ballet
companies -- Covent Garden, Paris Opera, and the Kirov in St Petersburg
-- and suggested that a combined Scottish Opera and Ballet might be
greater than the sum of its parts.
The Musicians' Union, too, offered a guarded welcome to the proposal
but pointed out that it would be very concerned about any erosion of the
freelance pool of players.
The Federation of Entertainment Unions stated that this was the third
working party on the issue and it was ''vitally important therefore that
some form of representation from the workforce be involved as it is
their future that is constantly under threat''.

Peter Evans asks us to consider the richness of roadside verges as we
speed by
HOVERING effortlessly over roadside verges, wings outstretched, tail
extended like an oriental fan, eyes glued to the ground in search of its
next meal, the kestrel is a common sight for motorists. A member of the
falcon family, it is symbolic of the meeting between the urban and rural
environments; a small piece of nature alongside the very unnatural human
creation that facilitates the movement of goods in our economy and lets
us drive our metal boxes wherever we want to go -- the road.
The kestrel's presence is an indication of an unseen ecological
microcosm. The bird is there because its meal ticket is scurrying around
somewhere in the verge, unaware of the fate that lies in store.
These grassy roadside verges, flanked by hedgerows and ditches
throughout Britain, offer a snapshot of the past -- a retrospective
picture of the way things used to be before the post-war intensification
of agriculture, when flower-rich meadows were commonplace.
As farm productivity rose, so wildlife was squeezed to the edge of the
no man's land of the roadside verge. There are around 207,000 hectares
of roadside verge in the UK, equivalent to an area of mixed grassland,
scrub, and trees the size of Berkshire. They have been described as
Britain's largest nature reserve, and they contain a wide variety of
habitats and species -- some of them rare.
A small mammal of importance, for example, is the Orkney vole, found
on verges in the Orkney islands. As well as kestrels and owls, which
prey on this and other small mammals, birds nest in the hedgerows, there
are butterflies and moths, amphibians in the ditches, and a wide range
of wild flowers.
Since the late 1970s in Scotland, one region has led the way in the
conservation of its roadside verges and, in particular, wild flowers.
Close co-operation between Lothian Regional Council and members of the
Scottish Wildlife Trust has resulted in an innovative scheme which has
attracted interest not only from other local authorities in Scotland,
but all over Britain.
''We are making local authorities far more aware of the importance of
verges,'' says Charles Pountain, chairman of the verges committee of
SWT's Lothian branch.
The scheme itself involves a recognition that if verges are left uncut
for a critical period from April to the end of August, wild flowers will
seed and the seeds germinate to provide a verge full of colour,
attractive to insects. ''The public like to see wild flowers, and people
don't necessarily want to trudge over hills to see them,'' says
Pountain.
In 1977, a list of Lothian's ''top 50'' rural verges of special
botanical interest was identified and presented to the region's highways
department. The verges were divided into three categories:
* Those containing an outstanding variety of wild flowers, often made
up of an excellent showing of common species such as the beautiful
meadow cranesbill, and red campion;
* Those containing a rare or less common species like the sand leek or
the dusky cranesbill -- perhaps only on a short length of verge;
* A special habitat verge bordering a woodland, ditch, or moorland,
and therefore possessing the characteristics of those environments.
Bluebells and primroses might border woodland, marsh marigolds and
valerian a ditch, and tormentil a moorland.
Co-operation was sought to prevent these verges being cut so the
flowers could seed. The trust received a sympathetic and enthusiastic
response and the agreement has been in operation ever since.
The letters SWT painted in white on the road, at the beginning and end
of the relevant section of verge, enable workmen to identify the
conserved stretch and leave it uncut until later in the year. Regular
visits are made by SWT members to the protected verges so that flower
species can be recorded and problems identified, such as the dumping of
chippings or salt at the roadside.
Other agencies -- British Telecom, ScottishPower and British Gas --
also receive the list of verges to avoid a section being dug up without
warning.
Although the 1977 agreement was a significant milestone, the
conservationists recognised it covered only a small fraction of the
total length of roadside verges in the region. The rest were still being
cut back during the growing season to the detriment of both wild flowers
and wildlife.
Four years ago, the region's highways department was approached again
and a new agreement struck: that all rural verges apart from the 50
identified as a special category would be cut to a depth of just one
metre through spring and summer, leaving the rest uncut.
The initiatives have enjoyed great success and SWT has combined with
the highways department to produce a colourful leaflet -- Lothian's
Roadside Verges -- not just grass by the way. Distributed widely to
conservation trusts and other local authorities throughout the UK, it
has resulted in an increasing awareness of the importance of verge
conservation, with positive evidence of wildlife-friendly management.
Out with their notebooks to record species diversity, SWT members
often see birds like the yellowhammer and the whitethroat at the
roadside, as well as insects, voles, and mice. It's an encouraging
picture, but there's still a long way to go. A report based on a survey
of wildlife trusts across Britain, aimed at reviewing current verge
management policies and practices, concludes ''that the wildlife
potential of the UK's roadside verges is at present underdeveloped''. It
recommends a comprehensive survey of verges to establish their existing
or potential value for nature conservation, and using the information
gleaned as a basis for management decisions.

ON October 11, 1982, 15,000 goldcrests landed on the Isle of May. The
vast coniferous forests of Scandinavia send more of these tiny birds
across to us every winter than any other species. We also have almost a
million pairs of them ourselves. Yet this, the smallest Scottish bird,
is vulnerable to two things in particular: acid rain and cold. Acid rain
is killing thousands of square miles of goldcrest woods across the
continent; the cold can kill a goldcrest because it weighs only five
grams and so its surface area is huge compared to its volume.
In the winters of 1916-17, 1946-47 and 1962-63 they were almost wiped
out. But a goldcrest lays 10 eggs, one and a half times her own
bodyweight, twice in a summer. The nest is a deep cup of spiders' webs
and moss, lined with feathers and hung by tiny handles from a conifer
branch tip, and the hen pushes her legs down among the layers of eggs to
warm them all. By such ingenuity the species' numbers can explode again.
You could come face to face with a goldcrest anywhere; one once sang
at me from three feet in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden and I could
confirm one of the few accurate transliterations of a bird song:
''cedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stitch-i-pee-so.'' Investigate any coastal
sycamore or gorse patchnow and you will hear the sibilant contact calls
and see the round dark eye and the flash of black banded gold on the
crown. Fresh from unpeopled fir woods, they simply don't notice you
there. Remember that they could survive 18 hours of darkness at minus 25
degrees -- for the loss of a fifth of their bodyweight -- but it makes
more sense to fly across the North sea to our warm October shores. And
even 15,000 individual goldcrests only weigh as much as you or I.

IT HAS always been a matter of surprise to me that there is a large
number of anglers who adore fishing but not fish. These fisherfolk will
fish from dawn to dusk, and on a day of success will keep a few fish,
but never does it cross their mind to eat their catch, whether it be the
bounty of fresh or salt water. They don't like to eat fish, but they
still love their fishing.
So bang goes the theory that fishing nowadays is a manifestation of
our long-held hunting instinct . . . to provide food for our families.
Who knows, our ancestors may not particulary have enjoyed the taste of
certain foods, but survival was all and any animal or fish captured in
the hunt was eaten. I wonder. Could there perhaps have been an Inuit in
his kayak in the Artic who whispered under his breath to himself that he
would rather not eat another sliver of seal's liver? Or an ancient Scot
whose stomach churned at the thought of pine-smoked capercaillie yet
again?
The great thing is that nowadays we have the luxury denied our
forebears of of the ability to choose food that we actually enjoy
eating. Freezers, supermarkets and speciality shops mean we can enjoy
strawberries from the Southern hemisphere in January, mangetout from
Thailand and uniformly shaped tasteless tomatoes from anywhere every day
of the year.
If you like fish and seafood, you can buy hoki from New Zealand, tiger
prawns from the Pacific, and lobsters from Canada. Slabs of tuna are now
in the shops alongside swordfish, sardines and shark. But all these are
brought to us at a price . . . not just financial, but ecological. In
the autumn edition of the World Wildlife Fund's newsletter, you can find
some interestng facts.
There are more than a million large-scale fishing boats working the
world's oceans and seas and twice as many small scale ones. One fifth of
fish caught are thrown back as unwanted, 27 million tonnes, and one
third of all fish caught is turned into fertiliser, oil and animal feed.
Cod stocks are now a third of 20 years ago and there are now only 24,000
tonnes of herring compared to one million five years ago. It is believed
that in one North Sea study, 4kg of non-marketable fish was discarded
for every kilgram of saleable fish landed.
Fishing fleets are difficult to police and it is thought that in
Scotland, 40% of all fish landed are ''black'' fish . . . illegal
according to regulations . . . fish caught over set quota, for example.
One kilogra, of tasty west-coast prawns will necessitate the death of
many juvenile fish of many species, as I have witnessed myself on a
day's trawling off Skye. Yet it is difficult to blame the small-boat
fisherman. Larger forces are set at work here. You have government
trading fishing rights to protect their tenancies of power and if you
feel strongly about such matters, you can only really make your protest
at the ballot box.
And the solitary rod fishermen in Scotland can do their bit too. Let's
not be seen killing fish just for the sake of it. In days past, I've
heard local worthies suggest that they used to get 20 or 30 trout a
night off a stretch of water and give them to the old folks for their
supper. All very commendable, but then they'll tell you that the fishing
isn't so good these days, and there aren't so many fish about. I wonder
why!
What is interesting is the fact that anglers these days are more
diversified, and conscious of the conception of conservation.
And those who never enjoyed the taste of fish but loved the challenge
of fishing are now less likely to take all the fish they catch and hawk
them round the doors in the mistaken belief that they are the village
benefactors. Catch a few and keep one for the table is OK by me.

Jack Webster embarks on a cruise to northern latitudes, and oceans of
interest.
AS passengers boarded the luxury liner Royal Princess, a buzz of
excitement by the quayside at Southampton was enough to set the mood for
a stirring adventure ahead. A gentle reminder that we were in the hands
of the cruising company which starred in television's Love Boat series
would merely add an edge of romantic anticipation to whom it may
concern.
Mind you, an early glance at the age profile might suggest love for
the second or third time around. Romance apart, however, this was the
cruise which would take in some of the greatest cities of northern
Europe, from Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Helsinki to Berlin, Amsterdam,
and Paris.
But the jewel in the crown of this cruising adventure would surely be
the great Russian city of St Petersburg, restored to its old name from
the Leningrad of Communist days -- and the main attraction to those 1200
people who were now embarking on the Royal Princess at Southampton.
We had come our various ways for a 13-day cruise, 900 of the
passengers flying into London from all points of the United States. As
typical of the 250 British, I had flown from Glasgow Airport to Heathrow
to be met by a Princess Cruises representative and ushered to a coach
for Southampton, without seeing my luggage again till it was delivered
to the cabin. Nothing could have been simpler.
I had known the delights of transatlantic travel, on the Queen Mary in
the 1960s and the QE2 last year, but this was the first time I had
sampled the holiday cruise.
I boarded this gleaming white liner at Southampton, settled into the
comfort of my cabin, with its own private balcony, and embarked on that
first priority with any large ship -- finding your way about.
Mastering the geography takes time but brings surprises like the
spacious cabaret area of the International Lounge, the sophisticated
Riviera nightclub and the Princess Court, where the resident pianist
turns out to be the larger-than-life Houston Allred, whose father was
Governor of Texas from 1935 until 1939.
By the time you have sussed out the facilities, ranging from
sun-decks, swimming-pools, and Jacuzzis to library, cinema, bars,
boutique, and casino, it is time to encompass it all, mentally, over a
cocktail at the height of the Horizon Lounge -- and figure out how your
time might be divided.
The beauty of cruising is that you can do everything or nothing. The
choice is yours, depending on your reasons for being there.
Three of the 13 evenings are given to formal attire, sophisticated
occasions which remind you, in these more casual times, that there is
much to be said for dressing up and feeling a million dollars.
These formal nights coincide with the captain's cocktail parties,
cool, pre-dinner gatherings of champagne, soft music, and dancing.
The captain turns out to be the handsome David Christie,
Edinburgh-born and eligible, whose technical talents will be more than
adequate if they match his social graces.
Indeed, for all the American orientation of this adventure, the Scots
have a strongly civilising influence. The ship's safety officer is Alan
Wilson from Shandon, near Helensburgh, who is sharing this voyage with
his wife and two little daughters.
The waiter who serves my afternoon tea comes from Newton Mearns and
the young lady in the photo shop has a familiar face. Yes, she is Glenys
Turnbull from Clarkston, Glasgow, who explodes in disbelief that I am
the father of her old classmate from Williamwood School.
The Princess Cruises company, which had its origins on the American
west coast, is now owned by P&amp;O and manned by British officers. There
are currently nine Princess ships, with three more on the way, a clear
indication of how this market is expanding.
In the gathering excitement, you keep one eye on the shore excursions
which will distinguish this particular cruise from any other. The tours
are superbly organised.
After a clear day at sea, between Southampton and Copenhagen, we
sailed into the Danish capital, which is more than Shakespeare was ever
privileged to do, and joined the bus-tour to Hamlet's castle, which
conjures up the suitable atmosphere, from banquet hall to ramparts.
The tour takes in Copenhagen itself but torrential rain put a dampener
on any real appreciation of its virtues, even the Tivoli Gardens. There
was time, however, for a dry stop at the statue of Hans Christian
Andersen's Little Mermaid.
Sunbathing was not a high expectation for a northern cruise but, after
the rain of Copenhagen, the weather did indeed come good and the sun
deck and poolsides were in much demand as you lapped up the offerings of
a perfect sky, reflected from the crinkled foil of a silver Baltic.
Next call was Stockholm, where the organised tours took in everything
from the royal palace to the Vasa Museum and the old town.
But of the Scandinavian capitals, I was impressed most of all by
Helsinki, even if morning arrival in the Finnish port had scarcely been
auspicious.
Foghorns blasted a bleak overture but the vapour veils were soon
giving way to clear skies and soaring temperatures as Helsinki beckoned.
The Kauppatori outdoor market was an immediate attraction for visitors
freshly off the ship, before the impressive Senate Square opened out
with a sense of grandeur.
It was a reminder that scenes from the film Reds were shot in this
fine square, with its Government Palace on one side, the university on
the other, and the Lutheran Cathedral of St Nicholas dominating on high,
with its stark beauty more than justifying the flight of steps.
One of the wonders of Helsinki is the Temppeliaukio Church, a creation
of the 1960s in which a piece of the city's solid granite rock was
blasted hollow and covered with a copper dome, to give an exquisite
effect of sight and sound.
Back on board, the passengers begin to gel as a temporary community,
like-minded couples finding each other and dividing into groups which
heighten fellowship on the one hand and that curious sense of rivalry on
the other.
For all the appeal of the variety artists, nothing quite outdoes the
unscripted entertainment of people-watching, that compulsive pastime
which grants unlimited scope to the imagination. Fantasies run high.
No Californian lady of Sumo proportions is too large to accentuate the
preposterous by wearing the pinkest of shell-suits. She may look like a
mud-wrestler but can turn out to be a nuclear physicist. And who is the
young man with her? A nephew? A courageous toyboy?
And what about that little clique seldom away from the roulette
tables, at all other times shutting out the sunlight with dark glasses?
Couldn't they have done it all at Caesar's Palace?
Then you engage the uncomplicated people and confirm a long-held
belief that there is an interesting story in most human beings. The
charming Mr Llewellyn from Cardiff turned out to be Lord Tonypandy's
banker.
The elderly lady, furrowed with history, had left Russia at the time
of the Bolshevik Revolution and was paying her very first visit back
home. What thoughts were in her noble head?
In more recent times, two Ukrainian couples of Jewish origin had left
the Soviet Union for America, afraid of what might happen to their sons
during conscription in a Russian Army where anti-Semitism is evidently
rife. They were going back for a quiet look.
All of which would sharpen the awareness that we were now approaching
the highlight of our adventure -- St Petersburg.
No advance publicity exaggerates the stunning beauty of the former
Leningrad, now restored to its pre-communist name and opening out to
broad avenues and handsome squares, graced by buildings which catch your
breath.
Faded grandeur, bordering occasionally on dilapidation, merely
heightens the sense of what this life must have been in the heyday of
the Czars. Of course, such polarisation of rich and poor was the stuff
of revolution, which came in 1917 and dominated for seven decades before
the dictatorship fell apart and, sadly, produced the turmoil which is
Russia today.
You applaud the advent of democracy, hope that Western-style freedom
will prevail but quickly realise the dangers of human energy let loose.
The Mafia, it seems, is everywhere. The safety-net of the poor is gone
and you ponder the irony that, in their new-found freedom, the Russian
people could actually vote themselves back to the dictatorship which at
least guaranteed their survival.
On such a brief visit, you put the politics to one side and
concentrate on the physical beauty. But even there, you are back to
people like Czar Peter the Great, the creator of this amazing city, who
must himself have been possessed of a maniacal energy.
In taking in the wonder of it, you never lose the sense of a man who
could also have his son tortured in the dungeons and who insisted on
attending every surgical operation in St Petersburg -- and taking part
in it himself!
But to the Winter Palace, oldest of the buildings which make up the
famous Hermitage Museum. Can there be anything more spectacular?
One glittering room gives way to another and another -- more than a
thousand in the palace alone -- revealing an imperial treasure of art
which runs from Leonardo da Vinci and Rembrandt to Picasso.
The Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul takes you across the river to
the burial place of the Czars while a 20-mile drive out of town brings
you the country splendour of the Peterhof Palace, summer residence of
the ruling family.
In smaller scale, Peterhof is reminiscent of Versailles, with its
gardens and fountains. The palace itself was destroyed to a shell in the
Second World War by the Nazis who occupied it and forced the Russians to
fire at their own architectural treasure.
So the fabric is virtually a post-war reconstruction, a heartening
reminder that great craftsmanship still exists.
The more you see of St Petersburg the more you realise the limitation
of your time. The glory of the Catherine Palace is just one attraction
which will have to wait.
For me, a highlight of St Petersburg was that deeply moving visit to
the grave of Tchaikovsky, who lies in Tikhvin Cemetery beside Borodin
and Rimsky-Korsakov.
When I finally tore myself away from that corner of musical genius,
there was just time to visit the cruiser Aurora, the first ship to side
with the Bolsheviks in 1917 -- and still sporting the gun which fired a
blank shot towards the Winter Palace to signal the start of the October
Revolution.
The ''storming'' of the palace was in fact a myth. A handful of men
simply walked up and announced the take-over. Lenin then faked wild
scenes of revolution for the benefit of a film crew so that history
would have a dramatic record of the event, however theatrically false!
(That is not to skirt round the subsequent bloodshed, which included the
massacre of the Czar and his family.)
The grand tour of St Petersburg had cost around #75 per head, which
did not include the #6.50 I paid for a single copy of the Daily Express
at a hotel reception desk!
Back on board that night, the floor show was given over to a team of
Russian dancers, relieving the resident team of entertainers whose
mini-Broadway shows bore the hallmark of real troupers.
Masterminding all that -- and providing the most interesting talks on
each port before arrival -- was the cruise director, John Lawrence, who
has given 20 years of dedication to these Princess liners.
Now that St Petersburg was behind us, the threat of anti-climax was
averted not only by the memories now distilling but by the prospect that
Berlin, Amsterdam, and Paris were still to come.
The former East German city of Rostock was the port of disembarkation
for the day-trip to Berlin, with a choice of train or bus for the
2[3/4]-hour journey. I had not been here for 25 years, in the days of
stalking Rudolf Hess at Spandau Jail.
Now it was all so different. The Berlin Wall was gone and the
Reichstag, rising again as the seat of government, shivered the spine
with memories of its former master.
This time, however, I could walk freely through the Brandenburg Gate
and, in temperatures approaching the nineties, stroll casually down
Unter den Linden to discover that East Berlin is a building-site of
reconstruction. But, unlike the Russians, the people at least have the
example and assistance of their fellow-Germans in the West.
With many a memory, I sauntered down the fashionable Kurfurstendamm
and had afternoon tea in the famous Krantzler Cafe of pre-war days,
before being driven back to the ship.
Onwards to Amsterdam, a city whose natural charms I had almost
forgotten, blighted now only by the drug-pushers at every street corner.
Recalling another age, I took my thoughts to the hiding-place of Anne
Frank, the girl of my own generation whose urge to be a journalist,
though ending with her life at 15, brought her the immortality of the
famous diary.
At the final port of Calais, I passed up the outing to Paris, choosing
instead to relax on board and contemplate all the things I hadn't done
on this eventful cruise.
I hadn't even seen the gymnasium, which removed the pounds you gained
in the dining-room. Nor had I sampled the casino, which removed the
pounds you won the night before.
But it had all added up to a memorable experience, places seen,
friendships forged, luxury enjoyed. If I had harboured doubts about
cruising they had now disappeared. But there is a more convincing
statistic. When the captain held his special party for the Princess Club
(passengers who had travelled on this or any other ship in the group) no
fewer than 900 people turned up!
That was the measure of repeat business. And having sampled the sheer
fascination, ease and relaxation of it all, I'm not in the least
surprised.

Milan is a big, serious and, in some ways, surprisingly un-Italian
place. Julie Davidson examines its credentials as a destination for a
winter weekend.
THIRD time lucky. It's taken three visits to get a handle on Milan.
The first, many years ago, was a daft stopover on a flying fashion show
which hit five European countries in two days, and Milan by night. From
the high-rise bedroom of a central hotel I saw the Madonnina of the
cathedral, sheathed in gold leaf, floating like ectoplasm above the
dome, and left before dawn.
The second visit was also overnight, but there were enough daylight
hours to investigate the cathedral with its Gothic bristles (''an
imitation hedgehog,'' said the rude D H Lawrence) and catch a train from
Mussolini's monumental station. The city took no shape beyond an
impression of weighty buildings and severe streets; much as reported by
Henry James, who found it ''prosaic and winterish, as if on the wrong
side of the Alps''.
On the third day of the third visit I feel I've just begun to crack
the code to this secretive city, which will never have the headiness of
Rome or the singularity of Venice, but which fits just as richly into
the cultural mosaic of the Italian peninsula. Milan is the other side of
its divinely-minted coin, the sober, industrious yet introspective side;
where the Neapolitans improvise, the Milanese reflect and design.
James was right in one respect: if not a winterish city Milan is a
city for winter. Climatically, it suffers from the lack of a great river
and the proximity of one. In summer there is no robust stream to siphon
off the trapped heat, and in winter the chilling fogs of the Po Valley
creep like spies through the suburbs and into the Piazza del Duomo.
But winter is still the most comfortable season for teasing out the
subtle nature and abundant treasures of Milan. This, after all, is the
city of the dynasties of Visconti and Sforza, the city where Manzoni was
born and Verdi died and where Leonardo da Vinci spent 25 years designing
hydraulic systems for the Lombardy canals and -- for such a genius --
making the fatal error of using oil pigments on dry plaster, rather than
fresco, when he painted the Last Supper.
This, too, is the town which has long been a touchstone for Italian
style and is now its international agent, and the city which became the
post-war powerhouse of the Italian economy. The lassitude of summer
doesn't become it; Milan empties in August. There are almost daily trade
fairs in September and October (accommodation scarce, suits plentiful)
and in spring the fashion industry moves in, shoving all aside with its
sharp little elbows and bony knees.
No, it has to be November. Milan is dormant in November, commercially
calm, and there's just a chance the sun will burn off the fog to give
some of those buttery noons and plum-coloured dusks which are the late
blessings of the Italian year. Linate International Airport is almost
hushed and only the most serious shopper is in town: Elton John, hauling
bagloads of Valentino Uomo from his taxi.
My own taxi-driver has the dignity of an anti-corruption magistrate.
His grave courtesy and polished manner are, I discover, commonplace
among drivers, doormen, waiters, and others plying humble trades. Where
is the ''tribe of stupid and shrivelled slaves'' peevishly described by
Shelley in 1818?
I'm staying, such a treat, in the city centre's most privileged
redoubt: the so-called ''golden triangle'' of designer salons, classy
cafes, and furtively opulent courtyard apartments contained within the
medieval street pattern of the Vias Montenapoleone, Spiga, and
Sant'Andrea. My little street, Via Gesu, is so exclusive that none of
its commercial enterprises carries anything as vulgar as a sign. Only a
brass plate and a man in quasi-military uniform accessorise the facade
of the restored fifteenth-century monastery which is the Four Seasons
Hotel.
From the cloistered (literally) ambience and understated luxury of
this retreat I venture forth in my best kit. If I can't live up to the
neighbourhood I can at least pay it the compliment of trying.
It may not be given to everyone to sample Four Seasons hospitality (my
bed was on the house, as it were) but the tight scale of the city centre
has produced a range of hotels across the price spectrum, all within
strolling distance of everything except Milan's best-known masterpiece
(the spectral Cenacolo, fading fast in the refectory of Santa Maria
della Grazie) and its best-kept surprise (the raffish Navigli district,
where the city restores a human dimension to its chic).
Friday afternoon: wherever you stay you feel the gravitational pull of
the Piazza del Duomo and the cathedral, the third largest church in the
world and its most awesome Gothic fantasy. I rubber-neck anew at the
spires, buttresses, crenellations, gargoyles, and just a few of its 2300
statues, thinking of all the metaphors which have gone before -- ''a
sort of snow dream by an artist architect, taken asleep in a glacier!''
wrote Elizabeth Barrett Browning -- and trying to construct a new one.
Floodlit, the cliffs and towers of chiselled marble look soft and
dribbling, like melting candlewax. Will that do?
Coffee at a bar in the rival cathedral across the piazza, the Galleria
Vittorio Emanuele. This grandiose nineteenth-century shopping mall is
shaped like a crucifix and has a glass cupola 150ft high. God may have
punished the architect, Giuseppe Mengoni, for his mimicry of the great
churches; days before it opened in 1865, Mengoni climbed the scaffolding
to admire his work, missed his footing, and fell to his death.
Saturday: my morning for the Brera antiques market, which is held on
the third Saturday of each month in the vivacious network of streets
between La Scala and the Brera art gallery. Every decent city has a
bookish, music-loving, craftworking quarter like the Brera, from
Greenwich Village to the back lanes of Byres Road: a poor man's Latin
Quarter.
I come not to buy, not even to browse, but to watch top-drawer Milan
consume; or pretend to consume as they patrol the stalls in vicuna and
Versace, furs flying in the face of moral fashion, greeting its friends
with precise kisses. The Brera market has its own top-notch passeggiata,
and it's worth seeing.
An orange tram to the Porta Genova and the confluence of two channels
of water. When, in The Tempest, Shakespeare mentioned the departure of
Prospero, Duke of Milan, from his home ''port'', stay-at-home scholars
believed he had slipped up.
But Shakespeare was aware that in his day you could sail from Milan to
the Adriatic by a system of waterways which linked the towns of the Po
Valley to its navigable rivers. The city was a major inland port with
its own network of canals, most of which are now covered over. The two
that survive are Naviglio Grande and Naviglio Pavese, and their cobbled
quays and converted warehouses are on the road to becoming another poor
man's Latin Quarter; or perhaps something closer to Leith-sur-Mer.
Not all the district's restaurants are new and voguish. I lunch in the
long-established Aurora, enjoying its belle-epoque decor as much as its
antipasti, and wander through a quayside market every bit as tatty as
the Barras. What would the footsore tourist do without Italy's churches?
On the walk back to the city centre I take a pew in the ancient church
which is Milan's spiritual lodestar: the Romanesque Sant Ambrogio,
dedicated to the Roman bishop who baptised St Augustine. The skeleton of
St Ambrose, robed and mitred, lies quietly in the crypt.
Sunday: my day for the Brera Gallery, Mantegna's Dead Christ,
Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, Rubens' noble stab at the Last Supper.
The eyes of his enigmatic Judas follow me about the room, chase me into
the cautious sunshine. Sundays are for walks in the park, and parks
aren't thick on the ground in Milan. There are the Giardini Pubblici and
the leafy Parco Sempione, but the most startling open space surrounds
and invades the Castello Sforzesco, the massive red brick fortress
raised by the engaging condottiere Francesco Sforza on the ruined castle
of his Visconti predecessor. Inside one of its museums is the Rondanini
Pieta, the last work of Michelangelo -- ''a pathetic relic,'' says H V
Morton, ''a fearful revelation of the triumph of old age''.
Monday: up on the roof, on intimate terms with the cosy crowd of
statues, I feel friendship for the streets below the cathedral. A wedge
of the city, a fragment of its nature have lodged in my head and I can
now say, more authentically, I have been to Milan. There is every reason
to return, and one clamorous reason: the doomed masterpiece of Leonardo
da Vinci is meanwhile locked in the refectory of Santa Maria delle
Grazie, while the restorers struggle to preserve its ghost.
* Julie Davidson was a guest of the Four Seasons Hotel, Milan (39 27

Liz Taylor discovers the jewels among the ghouls.
THIS is the weekend when witches walk and children used to go out
dressed as ghouls to collect tribute from their neighbours. Sadly I have
not had a guiser at my door for years. Perhaps parents are too
frightened of more evil forces than fairy-story witches to let their
children roam around after dark nowadays.
Nostalgia for the days of guising was brought back to me however by an
exhibition called ''Hallowe'en Horrors'' that runs from tomorrow until
Tuesday, October 31, All Saints' Eve or Hallowe'en, at Bonhams in
London. It is a collection of Hallowe'en party accessories, most of them
from America where the festival still seems to be celebrated in more
traditional fashion than it is here.
Most of the items on display are German-made and date from the turn of
the century. There are skull lanterns, with cut-out eyes and mouths,
made of metal or papier mache -- the sort Americans make from pumpkins
and we used to carve out of turnips. There are wall decorations in the
shape of cut-out cats, spiders, or witches riding on broomsticks and
lanterns made of tissue paper that must have been terrible fire hazards.
Their unsuitability for present-day use, however, has not affected their
value because Bonhams expect the small papier mache lanterns to fetch
around #300 each and a specially grand large one, for carrying at the
head of a parade, around #1200.
The Hallowe'en display is a colourful taster for a forthcoming sale of
unusual toys which Bonhams will auction on November 23. As an extra
touch of the bizarre, I was told that they were collected by an American
called Pascal J Cantona junior, who was Jackie Kennedy's hairdresser.
Besides the Hallowe'en items he amassed almost 500 tin toys, optical
and mechanical toys, conjuring tricks, Victorian puzzle games, and
Christmas and Easter decorations and when he sent his collection to
Bonhams he requested that the sale be billed as the Lady Sylvia Harlech
Memorial Collection of Toys. I asked the reason for this prestigious
sounding title, thinking that Mr Cantona was perhaps intending to donate
the proceeds to a memorial fund for the late Lady, but I was told: ''Oh,
no, she was a friend who helped him through a bad patch in his life and
we wanted his collection to be dedicated to her.'' Fair enough.
As well as Jackie Kennedy's hairdresser, all sorts of unlikely people
buy toys and memoirs of childhood. One of the favourite areas for
collecting is comics and competition to find early copies in good
condition is always fierce.
In September the record price for a single copy of a comic was broken
when Issue Number One of the Beano, dated Tuesday, July 30, 1938, was
sold at Comic Book Postal Auctions for an astonishing #3810. The
previous record was #2300 for a first-issue copy of the Dandy.
Just how valuable a first-issue copy can be is shown by a comparison
with prices paid at the same sale for later issues of the same comics.
An issue 40 of the Beano sold for #70 and an issue 72 of December 1939
made #60. The Dandy and the Beano are still going strong. Start saving
them now. Your descendants might be able to cash in with the last one.
Another popular area for collecting -- and one where prices are not
always mad -- are prints. Anyone interested in this rather complicated
field might like to know that the Fine Art Society in London is
currently showing a fine exhibition entitled ''The Great British Print
Show'' which runs until November 10 in its Bond Street premises.
There are 100 prints on display ranging in date from a late
eighteenth-century Berwick of the Chillingham Bull to a John Piper of
the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. All the artists represented are dead so
there is no evidence in the show of current print-makers -- perhaps
there can be another exhibition of their work somewhere soon to correct
the balance?
However, at least several of the artists in the Fine Art Society show
are Scottish, notably Muirhead Bone, D Y Cameron, James McBey, Ernest
Lumsden, and James McIntosh Patrick. Everything in the exhibition is for
sale and prices range from #450 for a James McIntosh Patrick of The Pass
of Glencoe to #16,000 for a woodcut of Rotterdam by Edward Wadsworth,
who is generally regarded as one of the most important print makers.
There was a great outburst of print buying in the 1920s when prices
soared and people treated them like investments, expecting them always
to rise in price but the fall of the stock market put an end to that
speculation too and for many years prints were a despised area of the
art market, many excellent pieces of work changing hands for a few
pounds. In the last five or six years, however, according to Nick
Curnow, art expert for Phillips in Scotland, prints have been finding
their feet again.
He advises that would be collectors look for McBey prints of Venice or
America and D Y Cameron prints of Ben Ledi which are worth over #1000
each. Interestingly, Cameron's prints of Perth Bridge and Arran are only
worth around #20 each.
Mr Curnow also cautions that ''print'' is an umbrella word covering a
wide range of pictures -- aquatints, etchings, woodcuts, linotypes,
lithographs, mezzotints, drypoints, linocuts, and wood engravings. The
print buyers' bible that will help enthusiasts find a way through all
the confusion is British Print Makers by Robin Garton, published by
Guichard and costing, unfortunately, #65.
MARKET NEWS
* IN A previous column about the twentieth-century decorative arts
sale that Phillips held in Glasgow on October 6, I referred to a set of
four Morris &amp; Co linen curtains decorated with crewelwork embroidery
which carried an estimate of #1000 to #1500. Someone else liked them too
for in the sale they sold for #8235.

As the witching hour approaches, 3-D ventures into a special dimension
to conjure up some tricks and treats.
THE kitchen of Glasgow's ancient Haggs Castle has cooked up some rare
treats in its time -- but it was tricks for Hallowe'en trade that were
on the menu when Richard and Stephanie McColl (below right) ventured in.
Museum assistant Elspeth Johnston was busy at the castle with rolls of
crepe, bits of black cloth and a pair of scissors -- creating a fiendish
DIY feast of fun for the big night.
Meanwhile, a three-prong attack on Hallowe'en spooks was being made by
nearly-three-year-old jolly Jack Mavor (right) at the Birrell Collection
Nursery, Edinburgh, sporting a #2.35 red cape from Jenners, Princes
Street, and a hairy witch's hat for the spellbinding sum of 90p.
''There's no need to spend a fortune, especially with Christmas just
round the corner,'' explained Elspeth Johnston as she showed her young
visitors how to magic up their own Hallowe'en horrors.
Standing by a cast iron cauldron that might once have simmered with
toads and spiders' legs, Elspeth listed the ingredients of success:
nine-year-old Richard's tabard is made from 50p worth of crepe paper and
sports a gold star quickly made with foil from a coffee pack or
chocolate bar.
His scary mask is red cardboard, stocked by most stationers. A #1
sheet is more than enough for several masks and a pumpkin ''lantern'',
or two. The one here has a strip of yellow paper behind the mouth and
eyes, but using white tissue it can be eerily back-lit with a torch.
Five-year-old sister Stephanie's cape is a cloth off-cut -- black dye
will transform any odd lengths of material overnight. Use iron-applied
tape for easy hemming.
Her witch's hat is a cardboard cone covered in crepe paper -- use
Fablon if you really want to shine at the party. A broom can be made
with twigs lying round the park, tied to an old shank.
Total cost of Elspeth's ghoulish gear: around #2, earning her our
Witch Report Best Value award.
* AS a bathtime treat next Tuesday night, perhaps young ghouls will
enjoy a dip in Boots' slick monster sludge or glow monster lunar foam
baths (#1.99 and #1.39) guaranteed to banish all traces of vampire
juice, sticky toffee apples and black face paint, as well as other
horrors.
Adults, meantime, may enjoy the company of a 66 inch inflatable
headless skeleton, #4.99 from Pickwicks, 241 Ingram Street, Glasgow, and
10 Shandwick Place, Edinburgh, who also offer the ultimate Hallowe'en
hag -- a #49.99 evil witch in an electric rocking chair.
Other nasties to look out for this October: gory blood pens, #1.50;
horror laser masks, #10; and a one-piece slinky witch's costume complete
with green make-up, #10.99.
EYE of newt and tongue of toad are a mite scarce this year, so try
these super-natural alternatives to get into ghoulish mood:
Piping hot Hallowe'en Pumpkin Soup is an ideal aperitif for an
evening's tricking and treating. Conjure it up in minutes from New
Covent Garden Soup Co's one-pint cartons, served with a dash of cream
and fresh herbs. From Tesco, Safeway, Asda, Sainsbury's and delis
throughout Scotland until November 5. Price #1.49.
TESCO'S Book of Spells and Spice (#2.49) boasts a fiendish confection
of jelly bones, ghouls, gargoyles, bats, a giant spider and Winnie the
Witch, with a ''bubble, bubble, toil and trouble'' incantation. For a
spooky party table try their Ghost cake at #7.99 and Slime Monster cake,
#4.99.
TOFFEE refrigerator cake is Robertson's idea of a chilly reception
when kids rap on your door and pose the threateningly familiar question.
Melt 2oz butter and 5oz Toffee Treat (#1.65 a jar) in a pan, remove and
stir in 7oz crushed digestives. Cool down and add 2oz chopped chocolate
and 2oz raisins. Press into greased 7inch fluted flan ring and
refrigerate overnight, before cutting into wedges.
BRING Frankenstein's Monster to life with Green's spooky cookies mix.
The #1.05 pack makes eight cookies, with pastry cutters that also create
a ghost, witch, skull, vampire and bat.
TREACLE toffee pumpkins, jelly bats, milk chocolate witches and a
ghostly white chocolate monster lollipop are among a Hallowe'en
assortment from Thorntons that's sure to go down a treat. From 25p to
#3.89 at branches throughout Scotland.
A GHOULISH blackcurrant liquorice nightcap could have party-leavers
going broom-broom as they rev up their engines (better than being
breathalysed for spirits). Wave your wand, turn on the tap and
SodaStream's 500ml bottle of Witches Brew (99p) magically converts into
5[1/2] litres.

WANT some smart advice on office dressing? Shift straight into top
gear. For the fresh choice in careerwear for women can now be a dress.
This most feminine of garments is challenging the tailored suit for
boardroom supremacy. . . and for pole position in the wardrobes of women
with executive ambitions, pretensions or delusions.
But, of course, it must be a very particular style of dress. Nothing
frilly, floral or fussy will do. Essentially, it must be straightforward
- absolutely clean in line and free from unnecessary detailing. It
should be contoured to fit the body, but not clench it in a
stranglehold.
Above all else, the new business dress is sleeveless. For, like poor
old Venus de Milo, in the process of rediscovery it has lost its arms.
But how can a winter season garment possibly leave arms bare? Simple,
really. You forget that latter-day Miss Moneypennies strive and thrive
in temperature-controlled environments. And in that tropical oasis on
the eighteenth floor, it matters not one jot that the outside world way
down below is tortured by icy blasts or carpeted in snow. In such an
environment, trans-seasonal clothing is a must.
Of course, we don't all work in utopian conditions. And women whose
workplace is less than an air-conditioned palace might consider that
this same sleeveless dress now slides under a matching tailored jacket
to form the new business suit. Alternatively, those who really feel the
cold can consider treating their armless wonder as a pinafore, to be
worn over a sleak-fitting or ribbed sweater. Rather Honor Blackman in
New Avengers mode, perhaps?
Accessories should be kept to a minimum. No flashy jewellery, fancy
tights or artfully knotted scarves. This is a moment for minimalism. And
all a girl now needs to conquer those corridors of power is a pair of
knee-high boots, a skinny little belt and a brain in full working order.
Well, there is only so much that a computer can achieve all by itself.

Aileen Little talks to a most extraordinary herbalist.
WHEN gardening and herb fanatic Sheena Cruickshank married for the
second time in 1987, she hit a snag. The home belonging to her new
husband, retired farmer Ian Cruickshank in Johnshaven, had a
magnificent, established garden -- with no scope for Sheena to unleash
her own ideas.
But Mearns folk are true sons of the soil. Ian responded with a grand
gesture: he bought his wife her own 8.5 acre ''allotment'' three miles
into the hinterland. The fact that it comprised a 4.5 acre hayfield
surrounded by gorse and broom in the back of beyond, proved only a
temporary setback (farmers had used the land as a dump -- Sheena once
collected 200 bottles in an hour); the plot, at Damside, has taken over
the couple's lives. They have turned it into an innovative restaurant
and herb garden.
Unsuspecting drivers straying on to the narrow roads around Damside on
winter nights must wonder if they've landed on another planet. Lit up
like a lighthouse on the flat, Mearns landscape, the restaurant is
likely to be rocking in the throes of Roman Night. Or Elizabethan Night.
Or Celtic Night. Just some of the novel ways in which Sheena's lifelong
interest in herbs now manifests itself.
''We started Friday theme dinners three years ago,'' she explains.
''They are buffet-style because I think people should have a taste of
everything. I bring out all the starters and I explain, say, that the
Romans used a lot of nut and garlic which I've made into pates. We
always do a fish, meat, vegetable and poulty dish and I tell them the
herbs we've used. Every second month, we do a vegetarian night.''
Having begun tentatively, by advertising in the local press, nowadays
the Cruickshanks don't bother. Every Friday night is packed.
The autumn/winter programme so far has included a medical herbalist ,
an interior designer , a reflexologist and a trained nurse who works in
hospitals as an aromatherapist will speak on November 20. Easter crafts
and floral art are other seasonal favourites.
The Cruickshanks' ideas aren't simply about good business, though.
Sheena has a real mission to educate fellow Scots about herbs. Damside's
nursery sells 120 different varieties ranging from culinary and
medicinal to pot pourri and dye plants.
In the realm of dyes, she's keen to promote Sweet Joe Pye -- a plant
she brought back from the USA (''it gives a beautiful pale pink through
to dark red'').
Sheena's interest developed when at St Margaret's School, Edinburgh.
She frequently skipped classes, seeking instead a Rousseauesque
education at the Botanic Gardens near her home. ''The gardeners were so
used to seeing me, they'd tell me about edible plants -- I nibbled them
for snacks. My aunt in Inveraray used to serve me nettle tea and
Boneset.'' Research in the city library provided the background
knowledge which Cruickshank now imparts to coach parties.
Her dream is to escape from the kitchen long enough to organise the
herb garden into a kind of living museum. It would have an Egyptian
section and plots representing American and Alaskan Indians.
Meantime, it is natives of the north-east who are treated to culinary
exotica plundered from Apicus, a first-century cookery book. Roman Night
sees Sheena cooking up fungi farnei (mushrooms in coriander wine sauce)
and in pisce oenogarum (fish in herb sauce). Last month, Aberdeen
District Council brought visiting Americans for A Taste of Ancient
Grampian which included, among other delicacies, Damside Hairst Bree (a
Celtic dish of lamb marinated with wild thyme, mint and local
raspberries).
The irony is that, while Ian Cruickshank does sterling work
maintaining the herb garden his wife has become a victim of her own
success. Sheena is still waiting for the day she has time to potter in
her garden. But there are compensations, of course. For a start, she
says she meets ''wonderful people''.
And a recent discovery, brings added satisfaction. The regional
archaeologist has told the Cruickshanks there is evidence on Damside of
man's cultivation 6000 years ago; Ian has dug up innumerable flints to
prove it. ''Just think, early man was eating herbs right here,'' Sheena
says with obvious pleasure.
* Damside Garden Herbs lies between Stonehaven and Montrose, off the
A92 at Johnshaven. Telephone 01561 361496. Guy Fawkes night is
celebrated on November 3, with Elizabethan food.

Plants which don't pull their weight get short shrift from Joan Tait.
Fay Young talks to a woman for whom the geometric discipline of classic
garden design is secondary to intuition and spontaneity.
A SENSIBLE plant in Joan Tait's garden is one that can take care of
itself. Like the variegated ground elder spreading comfortably round the
rhododendrons or the sturdy euphorbia which produces a crop of seedlings
in the gravel path every year. She can't be doing with ''precious
things'' which demand nursing or bushes that don't pull their weight.
That new rose which needs to be tied up is obviously in the wrong place
and the unproductive cystis is being given one last chance to bloom.
Tait does not make plans. ''A friend once described me as a very
reactive person and I took that as a compliment.'' Her garden is a place
where things seem to happen almost by chance. If she likes the result
she is not afraid to repeat the effect over and over again. If it
doesn't work she simply moves the plant until it looks right -- or under
the trees in the far corner where it doesn't worry her any more. Here is
a spontaneous and intuitive gardener.
When she is not running the Dutch House china shop in Edinburgh, Tait
weeds and shifts plants around as the mood takes her. She makes mistakes
and starts again. She reads voraciously and spends Friday night glued to
the television gardening programmes. She chooses plants for their colour
and shape and often forgets what they are called. She has yet to develop
the confidence to try growing from seed but her cuttings often seem to
strike first time.
What Tait's garden shows is what I am here to discover. Ground cover
can be used simply but effectively to cover awkward spaces to soften the
view and reduce hard labour. Her achievements should encourage others,
like me, who are put off garden design by the thought of the geometry
which seems to be involved. Especially since at first sight the garden
round Holly Cottage looks so carefully laid out. Neatly trimmed hedges,
terraced borders and smooth stepped lawns do not happen by chance.
A kind of plan has been imposed by necessity. The terraced borders are
the creation of Tait's partner, Robbie, and to put it bluntly Tait is
doing her level-best to cover them up. Since they were built three years
ago she has devoted many Sundays to the task of disguising them;
''slathering'' the pre-stressed concrete with yoghurt in the hope of
cultivating moss; filling the freshly deposited top soil with plants
which are guaranteed to spread.
Landscaping was a solution to the steeply sloping grass bank which was
difficult to mow and threatened to slide into the back of the cottage.
As Tait puts it, Robbie is not only a geologist but also Mediterranean
so terracing came naturally and since he was prepared to put in the hard
work to make it happen she accepted it. She still dislikes the view in
autumn when plants die back to reveal the too-clean face of synthetic
material which has not yet yielded to the yoghurt. But she can walk up
the slope without twisting her ankles. The borders are easy to plant and
weed and the whole garden makes more sense.
''For seven years I was just puddling about,'' she says. ''I would
plant trees and bushes but I was never really satisfied with the
result.'' Before moving to her converted farm worker's cottage 10 years
ago she had a small town garden which was easy to keep, ''fiddling about
at weekends''. She chose Holly Cottage because it seemed ideal for her
imminent grandchildren and then realised it came with an awful lot of
garden.
Mature trees -- two yews, a cedar and a Australian oak -- gave
framework to seven eighths of an acre of nettles and coarse grass. Now
they have added some young trees and there is still plenty of room for
the five grandchildren who come to stay and play in the wooden summer
house on the edge of the new lawn.
Each garden says something about the person who works in it. The
recurring themes which give continuity to the spontaneous planting
reflect Tait's taste for variegated foliage, ''it's so bright and
cheerful''. There is a variegated holly hedge round the front garden.
Variegated ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria variegata) provides a
bright undercover for mature rhododenrons and successfully suppresses
weeds without straying as far as its common green relative.
She uses variegated hostas for a bright touch under dark shrubs, the
variegated figwort (scrophularia acquatica) spreads itself round the
borders, variegated hebes appear next to herbs, there is even a
variegated London Pride (urbium Aurea Punctata).
Colour is another unifying theme. On the whole pink is out because it
clashes with the orangey shades of the village buildings. Yellow is in
(''a bit too much'') so Rudbeckia spreads round the house and looks in
the front window. ''I love flowers which seem to float on air,'' says
Tait. A black iron cockerel, surrounded by yellow potentilla, will soon
be counterbalanced by an eagle on the other side of the garden.
Repetition is a practical and economic solution to the need to cover a
lot of ground as quickly and effectively as possible. That long narrow
border at the top of the terrace was filled straight away with 40
Lavender Munstead because they were a good price in Parker's catalogue.
They are punctuated symmetrically with two small yellow conifers. The
''moundy'' shapes of sage and rue recur between flowers.
A long sweep of geranium Johnson's Blue lines the boundary beech and
hawthorn edge simply because the gardener has had the patience to divide
and spread the plants every year for the past ten years. ''I have
time,'' she says. She plans to do the same with cotoneaster along an
uncovered stretch of ground round the corner. She will break off a new
shoot with a heel of old wood, dip it in rooting powder and pop it in a
pot. ''It often seems to work and if it doesn't I haven't lost
anything.''
Some of the most successful touches are not really hers at all. She
did indeed place the variegated lamium (maculatum, Beacon Silver) which
catches your eye in a crack between old stone steps leading to the lawn.
But the chocolate brown clover (Trifolium repens purpurascens) just
settled itself into a gap in the terrace path and is now spreading
nicely. The gardener's talent is knowing when to accept these ''little
gifts from God'' and leave them well alone.
Where plants won't grow she lays black polythene and covers it with
bark chippings. One yew tree is surrounded by a bed of stones picked out
of the garden or brought back from the beach and the other will soon be
the same. The aim is to reduce as much unnecessary labour as possible.
As far as Tait is concerned gardening is a pleasure which should not
dominate all her spare time.
Once a fortnight she has the help of her ''treasure'', Gerry, who cuts
grass, digs, prunes and builds the compost heap. On evenings after work
she actually enjoys weeding. ''It is relaxing to push around in the
soil.''
But she makes time for simply being in the garden: ''When the sun is
shining it is very nice to bring a cup of coffee and a cushion and sit
smelling the rosemary.''

Catherine Brown samples the best of British, but fears that a taste
revolution is not on the cards.
STROLLING across Tower Bridge, for my lunchtime date on the South
Bank, a group of people on the quayside are standing round what looks
like a very large black and white spotted pig, sniffing among the tables
and chairs of my eating destination. By the time I get down the steps
and along the quayside the pig has been herded back into his pen. He's
been invited, it turns out, to this lunch of British Food at its Best at
Butler's Wharf Chop House, as an endangered species of Saddleback pig.
While he munches on his lunch of straw, we go inside for ours which
tactfully does not include pig.
But first, a few words from Sir Terence Conran, the designer of this
gastrodome complex of new eating venues and old-style independent food
shops.
He has taken up the challenge of promoting a series of menus, which
includes British foods in danger of extinction, because he believes that
it's time to stop whingeing about the bad things in the British diet and
get on with making a better job of our rarer assets. The Chop House has
a reputation for modernising traditional British food, which means
getting the best quality produce, not from France or Italy, but from
around Britain.
Yes, of course. And we all applaud his sentiments.
But the problem, as the large multiples might put it, is that there is
just not enough of it around. It's exclusive and expensive. The
preservation of old British tastes is a campaign, not a reality -- yet.
If it is to succeed it requires an army of enthusiasts, seeking out and
buying from those still making a living from foods which were -- before
multiple retailers and unsympathetic European legislation -- as common
as fish and chips.
The campaign's recruitment of Conran, however, brings in a factor
which has already proved successful with other endangered bits of
British history, not least of which is the restaurant we are currently
sitting in.
The restaurant we are in Butler's Wharf was a derelict and decaying
warehouse in unfashionable South-east London when Conran sailed past it
one day in 1979, and had a vision.
It now has an eating space for 750 customers in a complex of three
restaurants and those experts, who said that smart city eaters would
never ''go south'' to eat, have had to eat their words.
Looking round the lunchtime guests there is no shortage of other
pioneering and inventive spirits here to support Conran's optimism.
Opposite me is the food historian, Alan Davidson, whose seminal works on
seafood and fruit have become bibles for optimistic preservers.
Next to me is Myrtle Allen, of Ballymaloe House in Ireland, who has
passed-on the kitchen, where she pioneered the preservation of
traditional Irish foods, to the next generation. She is now travelling
Europe as president of Euro-Toques, the European Community of Cooks,
whose current battle is with legislation which will close down small
abattoirs, as it has already closed down small cheese-makers who could
not afford to re-equip in stainless steel.
There is food consultant William Black who has sourced all the foods
for the meal, and Henrietta Green, author of the 1996 Food Lovers' Guide
to Britain, (BBC Books, #12.99) who is handing out details of her book
launch, where 20 of the 1000 odd ''endangered'' producers and suppliers
listed will be available with their foods.
And there is Peter King, Field Officer of the Rare Breeds Survival
Trust, who has been responsible for the main course North Ronaldsay
lamb, from a wiry herd of primitive species of seaweed-eating sheep on
the Orkney island of Linga Holm. A team of nine Trust workers visits the
island for a few weeks in August each year to check the health of the
animals.
So what did we think of the lamb? Some said the flavour was as good
as, if not better, than pre-sale ita (the highly acclaimed French
seaweed-eating sheep). Myrtle Allen said it would have been even better
if the chef had cooked it properly. Alan Davidson thought the shoulder,
which had been Scottish slow-stewed, brought out the good flavour better
than the fast-English roasted leg. The debate continued.
The meal ended with a large plateful of ripe farmhouse cheddars and
slices of five rare varieties of apples followed by an old-fashioned
sweetmeat tart and thick English cream.
Finlay Macleod, the restaurant manager (previously of the Glasgow
Buttery) offered us smart little boxes to take away our left-overs and I
made my way back over the bridge, clutching my boxes, and wishing that
the rare-taste campaigners might succeed.

IN recent times the Brewery Tap at Kelvin Hall has seen a lot of
huffin', puf
fin', tinklin' glass, hollerin' and hootin'. A whiles back the place
was awash with Buffalo Beer when Harry Barry came into town and
tarnation, if that wasn't enough, in rode that Yankee doodle dandy
Wicked Pete with a three-bottle-length yarn spun all the way from
California.
Pete Slosberg is the man behind Pete's Wicked Ales and a growing
portfolio of ''wicked'' beers. Born in Connecticut, raised in New York
and now living in California, Slosberg has the energy of a man who will
go far. However, he never drank beer, wine, or spirits until at the age
of 29 he visited a friend's house where he was introduced to home-made
wine. He was hooked on the idea of home brewing and decided to have a
go.
It wasn't until 1979 when he moved to California and into a house with
a cellar that he had the space to set up his equipment. Coincidentally,
1979 was the first year that home brewing became legal in the US. His
first effort was a Chardonnay, but alas he was unable to sample his
creation right away for he had overlooked that the wine would first have
to mature. Not being born with the patience required, Slosberg was
advised to turn his attention to beer as it could be taken within a few
weeks.
Home brewers could also make their beers tastier than those
mass-produced for the American market which is notorious for its bland
products. Slosberg continued his home-brewing hobby for some years
experimenting with different adjuncts. He was particularly keen to
re-create his favourite ale, a nut-brown beer made by Samuel Smith in
1985 for the US market.
Eventually he hit upon a recipe that provided him with his first
commercially produced ale -- Pete's Wicked Ale. Slosberg gave up his job
in the marketing department at IBM and with a partner started brewing at
a local micro-brewery. Every year for the past nine years sales have
doubled and around 100 million 12oz bottles of Wicked Ales are now
produced annually at a brewery in New Ulm, Minnesota.
Wicked Ale has a caramel richness with balanced hop bitterness. A bit
thin in body, the ale certainly benefits from a long pour. This reduces
much of the high gas content and creates an excellent hop and malt
aroma. Drink at cellar temperature, not too cold.
The Wicked Ale range doubled following a trip to the Czech Republic in
1981 with the introduction of Pete's Wicked Lager.
Slosberg admits to a limited technical knowledge and employs a
full-time brewmaster in Pat Touteaus, a native of Minnesota who has had
a formal training in Munich. His input has been to increase the wicked
range with Wicked Red, an amber ale employing Munich malt. Wicked Honey
Wheat and summer and winter brews complete the portfolio.
In the US there is tremendous growth in brewmaster dinners where
different beers are tied to certain dishes. Indeed, culinary schools are
now beginning to learn how to use beer with cooking. Slosberg spends
much time travelling around the country and addressing a public that is
still unsure about new varieties of beer.
Customers are encouraged to talk about beer and on every label is a
toll-free 0800 number. Each of Slosberg's employees has to pass a beer
test which helps them answer any of the 5000 calls the office receives
each month.
Wicked Ales are available at Oddbins, Peckhams, and many bars
including the Brewery Tap where Braveheart fever is currently sweeping
through its lusty chambers. And on November 1, for two weeks, foreign
accents will be locked away when every tap on the premises surrenders to
Scottish cask ales, all hand-gathered by its ebullient owners, Alan and
Douglas Cunningham.

Father Roland Walls, a Catholic priest, lives in Roslin, near
Edinburgh, with his brother.
* MY programme is simple and I enjoy every bit of food I eat. At
quarter past four in the morning, I get up and have a cup of real
coffee, three Rich Tea biscuits, and half an orange. I go about my
business and at 8am I come in for breakfast two which consists of two
bits of bread and jam, home-made if I can get it, with unsalted butter
followed by another cup of coffee.
I have become a vegetarian through old age because I find I can't eat
much at any one time so, as with sleep, I get snatches of food. Good and
often makes me feel light and topped up because I don't eat much at a
time. At lunch I have half an apple, a cup of tea, bread and cheese --
like Stilton -- always accompanied by a clove of raw garlic because that
keeps the circulation going and bugs at bay. From March to the end of
April I gather the wild garlic from Roslin Glen and make cheese
sandwiches with that. At half past three I emerge from a wonderfully
longish siesta with a cup of coffee; I'm not allowed more than four cups
a day so I usually try to keep it down to three.
In the evening I will have varied vegetables topped with half a tin of
good quality soup like Baxters plus spuds with their skins on. Being old
and entering a second childhood, I love semolina, tapioca, rice pudding
with a dollop of fruit in the middle, and a cup of tea. I must say my
favourite dish is a rice pudding cooked for about four hours in a very
low oven. If heaven has delights, that will be one of them . . . And I
enjoy home-brewed ale once in a while.
At about 9pm I'll have the first of those three breakfasts when I
crack up three Ryvitas, sprinkled with that lovely dark brown sugar, and
the top of a bottle of milk. It's excellent to go to bed on, very
energising for the following day. Everybody should go to bed on
something.
I'm a bit of a fuddy duddy: if you go into Sainsbury's and look around
it's obscene to see so much food. And if you eat simply, it's much
better for you than having three enormous meals.

IT'S been a good harvest of apples and pears this year.This is
peak-time for the mid-season varieties of eating apples like Spartan,
Sunset, Kids Orange Red and Laxton Superb. Unlike the ubiquitous Golden
Delicious, this English crop is not large, and in a few weeks these
varieties will be gone.
Lasting longer into the winter are the late-ripening Egremont Russet,
Blenheim Orange and Ribston Pippen. Along with Cox's Pippens, these are
the apples to eat with nuts and cheese at Christmas.

Lady Claire MacDonald warns that ignoring personal taste for Christmas
cakes can drive you nutty.
I RARELY achieve my intentions. Each year I always intend to make my
Christmas cakes (note the plural -- we seem to get through rather a lot
of Christmas cake) by the end of September, but here I am, true to form,
and running a month late. But how I love making Christmas cake -- in
spite of the many disadvantages of being supposedly adult, there are
several plus-points to being mistress of your own kitchen, and one is to
leave sufficient cake mixture in the bowl for a good licking out with a
spatula.
No cake tastes better, to me, than Christmas cake. But what you put
into your Christmas cake must depend on what you like. If you don't
like, for instance, glace cherries (and I don't, I think they are sickly
and tasteless) then substitute something else, like chopped dried
apricots. The thing you mustn't change are the basic ingredients which
give the balance to the cake, the butter and sugar, the flour and eggs.
Use more or less grated orange and lemon rind, if you like a more
pronounced citrus flavour. I used to make a cake each year for someone
who couldn't abide treacle and who could detect its presence even in
minute amounts, as in my cake recipe below, so I just left it out. The
treacle content is only there, I am sure, to give a darker colour to the
cake.
I love a spicier cake than my basic recipe below, so I always up the
amount of spices, all of them. Anyone who remembers the brilliant cook
Michael Smith, sadly now dead, may know his Christmas cake recipe which
contained chopped prunes. These give a rich and almost slightly bitter
taste to the cake. When I put prunes into the cake (I vary it a bit each
year) I soak them overnight in the brandy or whisky, which improves
their flavour considerably and seems to do away with the bitter
tendency.
The cake takes just minutes to make, but assembling the ingredients
takes a small amount of time, and the cooking takes hours. If the heat
is too great the cake will rise and crack on top. Long and slow cooking
is what a good fruit cake, such as this recipe produces, needs.
If you have an Aga or a Raeburn beware forgetting the cake. I once
went to bed forgetting the two cakes in my Aga, and providentially the
telephone rang around 1.30am. It was our eldest daughter's
boarding-school, to tell us that she had been whisked into hospital to
have her appendix removed. I'm slightly ashamed to admit that
immediately after my initial pang of concern for her, I was swept over
with relief as I remembered the cakes in the oven, by then perfectly
cooked.
To see if they are cooked, check that the cakes are just shrinking in
from the sides of the paper-lined cake tin. Stick a skewer into the
centre of the cake -- it should come out only very slightly sticky. Take
the cake out of the oven and stick the skewer into the cake all over,
and right down to the bottom of the cake in the tin. Pour brandy or
whisky over the cake, when cold, before wrapping it in foil to store in
a cool place. If anyone who might eat the cake is allergic, for whatever
reason, to alcohol, don't do this, but you should be quite safe putting
the alcohol into the cake mixture itself, because the cooking should
remove the actual alcohol content while leaving a faint glow of taste.
What space precludes me from telling you about in any depth is the
alternative Christmas cake to the traditional dark, rich fruit cake. I
am thinking of a light, blond cake, which I make using a large amount of
ground almonds, and using crystallised pineapple, and the best
crystallised citrus fruits, apricots, and plums. It doesn't keep as well
as a dark fruit cake, but it does make a most delicious cake which I
decorate with an arrangement of glace fruits on top, instead of marzipan
and white icing. More about that, perhaps, next year!
Here is the recipe I base our Christmas cakes on each year. Adjust the
contents to your own preference. This makes a cake about 10" diameter.
LADY CLAIRE'S CHRISTMAS CAKE
6oz chopped crystallised or candied peel
6oz chopped glace cherries
6oz flaked almonds, toasted
1lb sultanas
1lb raisins
12oz currants
10oz plain white flour sieved
10oz butter
10oz soft dark brown sugar, or muscovado sugar
grated rinds of two lemons and one orange
1 tablespoon black treacle
6 large eggs, beaten together
1 rounded teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1 rounded teaspoon mixed
spice, 2 rounded teaspoons powdered cinnamon
5 fl oz brandy or whisky
Butter a 10" round cake tin and line with a double thickness of baking
parchment. Tie a double thickness of brown paper around the tin, or put
it into a cardboard box. Cut two discs of baking parchment to go on top
of the cake as it cooks.
Prepare the fruit and put in a large bowl. Sieve in about a third of
the flour and, with your hands, mix all together well so the fruit is
thoroughly coated with flour -- this prevents it sinking. Beat the
butter and sugar till fluffy. Beat in grated lemon and orange rinds and
the treacle. Beating all the time, add the eggs, a small amount at a
time, adding some of the sieved flour. Mix in rest of flour, spices,
brandy or whisky, and, lastly, the fruit, mixing thoroughly. Put into
prepared tin and smooth even, then push a small hollow in the centre.
Put the cake into a moderate oven, 350F, 180 C, gas mark 4, for 20
minutes, then lower heat to 275F, 140 C, gas mark 1, and bake for three
more hours. When it is cooked, take it out of the oven and leave to cool
in tin. Skewer it and trickle in brandy or whisky if you like, when it
is cold, and wrap it in a double thickness of foil. Store in a cool
place till you are ready to marzipan it, then, two or three days later,
to ice it.

Two Glasgow businessmen have a cuisine-dream to operate 24-hour cafes,
but as Stephen Ferguson finds, the authorities don't share their vision.
SOMETIMES the city of Glasgow acts like a parent telling its children
to go to bed early, long before they feel ready to retire. The children
whine, they grumble, but reluctantly they go -- they know who's boss.
Like most British cities, Glasgow professes -- in deed rather than in
word -- to need its beauty sleep, it closes its eyes to its insomniacs
and night-shifters and late-night eccentrics and late-in-the-day lovers
and thinkers. It shuts down. Long after the bars have been laid to rest,
and after clubland has closed its doors also, at 1am when the curfew is
imposed, the streets and buildings dream on until first light.
Yet like stubborn children who read books under the covers with the
aid of torchlight, two Glasgow cafe owners are trying to sneak 24-hour
cafe-life into Glasgow's social and cultural circles. Day and night,
Glasgow will be open; wide-awake, beaming and alive -- that's their
cuisine-dream. And they seem to be getting close to realising it, slowly
though, in spite of the snoring ''zeds'' from the powers that be.
So far both proprietors -- Mark Norris of Insomnia Gallery and Gareth
McAulay of Goldmine Cafe -- are left in no doubt that the idea of a
24-hour Glasgow is seen as a Glasgow too hot to handle.
On Wednesday, Insomnia Gallery plans to open for 24-hours for the
first time, and plans to stay open 7 days a week, 365 days in the year,
having secured all the permission and licences required to stay open and
never close .
Currently the closest Glasgow can get to 24-hour status is Goldmine
cafe in Midland Street, beside The Arches -- it has a late-night
catering licence that allows it to open for 23 hours, but has to close
its doors for an hour between 4am and 5am, and cease serving customers
during this time. ''I was never given a reason why this has to happen
except that it was licensing policy, and I do lose a lot of business
during that time,'' says McAulay, the owner and manager of Goldmine.
''But because I advertise the cafe as being open for 24 hours, the
licensing board phoned me and kicked my butt over it, but after I
explained that people are still using the space during that time and so
essentially I'm still 24-hours, they seemed quite happy.'' Currently the
23-hour ''openness'' applies only to a Friday and Saturday night, but
McAulay envisages a cafe environment that never sleeps.
The cafe is like a hide-out. Coloured gold and fitted with a
totem-pole and artificial cacti, daylight seems far away and round a
corner;it feels like a cafe-space where the outside world no longer
exists -- something post-nuclear or subterranean. McAulay has turned a
former car-park into an exotic and quixotic mini-theme park that plans
to be a cabaret-space, and a world very separate and distinct from
clubland -- something ever-changing and quietly spectacular.
For Mark Norris and his Insomnia Gallery on Woodlands Road, close to
the city's West End, the feel is more laid-back and less demanding,
modelled on the relaxed American style that Norris has first-hand
experience at running. Yet the essential hurdles of licensing laws have
thrown him into a world of conflicting opinion and illogical
intransigence that fails to keep him as relaxed as Insomnia's
surroundings.
''In order to be open 24 hours I only required a late-night catering
licence between 11 at night and five in the morning, but the licensing
board has made the decision that outside of the city centre you couldn't
be open between three and five in the morning, but if you have the
licence then 11 until three is OK.
''They seemed to be objecting about noise because it's a residential
area, but it's still a residential area between 11 and three -- what is
so different about three to five is beyond me. Although now I have the
licence between 11 and 5, the board have still not said that I can stay
open for 24-hours. But that's what I'm going to do.''
To pre-empt the problem of noise to neighbouring residents from people
coming and going throughout the night Norris gained 100% favourable
permission from local residents to open for 24 hours on a three-month
trial basis, but as yet this has cut little or no ice with the licensing
board.
But the elusive six-hour licence for the late-night hours was just one
problem to overcome -- it seems that everybody has an opinion on whether
a cafe can stay open 24 hours or not.
''First of all, the Planning Department said we were within our
rights, then they said we weren't, and then they said we were.
Environmental Health have agreed to us opening for a trial period of a
year. After much deliberation, the police have no problem with us.''
Norris is determined to see daylight on the other side of Kafka's
Glasgow. He sees the obvious loopholes and contradictions within the
licensing laws as being their main downfall, and has planned several
ways to combat the rules and expose their absurdities should any new
objection be raised from whatever quarter.
Glasgow has a chequered history of late-night eating. The restaurant
Change At Jamaica keeps late-night hours but only after lodging a
petition with the licensing board from disaffected patrons. Nico's
cafe/bar on Sauchiehall Street formally opened during the night in the
premises upstairs, but its success was short-lived. Dunkin' Donuts on
Argyle Street gained a dubious reputation due to its dubious clientele,
and The Pancake Place on Union Street seems to fall into the no man's
land that lies between cafe and restaurant.
So what will be different about Goldmine and Insomnia? For a start
both proprietors believe that the 24-hour lifestyle has come of age, and
have tailored their 24-hour philosophies to expect, and tempt, a wide
cross-section of people.
''This is a different generation,'' says McAulay, who named his cafe
Goldmine because that's exactly what he hopes it will be financially.
''People don't want to go to their beds at normal times, and I think
that clubbing is on its way out. If you go anywhere in Europe then
you'll see that all-night cafes are the thing for young people now.''
But the cafes will have to be vigilant. Goldmine has a licensed
steward on its door at night and Insomnia plans to hire a security firm
for its twilight patrol. The late-night hours in Glasgow are
traditionally filled with the discontented in society: the drugged, the
drunk, the dealers, the gangsters, and poor control on the door could
quickly end the cafes' all-night vigils before they properly begin.
Norris envisages people of all ages flopping into his
cafe/gallery/deli throughout the night just as they do during the day.
At one table a man in a bow-tie can be seen looking out of the window
watching his thoughts go by like traffic, at another two silent partners
deliberate the space around each other, and in between there is an
intimate huddle of conferring adults dissecting a subject or dissecting
a soul, while before me Norris waxes on the function of the civil
servant in a democratic society.
The promise seems so civilised in itself -- a far cry from the fears
of uncivilised behaviour that the licensing bodies have, for years,
seemed so afraid of. But it remains to be seen how the promise is kept.

THIS is a tale from some years ago. It concerns a young, and rather
unworldly, Glasgow girl who was invited out on a date with a lad who
knew his way about. He took her to an intimidating Italian restaurant
where, after she ordered a starter of melon, she was asked by the waiter
if she would like some ginger.
''No,'' she replied, with as much panache as she could muster,''I
believe we're having wine.''
It wouldn't happen today, of course. Not now that a decent bottle of
wine has become as much a fixture on the table as in Italy and France;
not in a world of Jilly Gooldens, of wine clubs and, especially, of
supermarkets.
These last have played a major role in changing the tippling habits of
a generation. A bottle or two can be spotted in most trolleys along with
the organic wholemeal, and the environmentally-friendly dishwasher
powder.
However, even regular Zinfandel zealots and Chardonnay chasers can
find the brightly-lit yardage of wine shelves in supermarkets just a bit
daunting. That is where wine crusader Tom Stevenson rides to the rescue
with this latest book, which he calls a ''definitive guide'' to
supermarket drink.
Stevenson's credentials are impressive, with no fewer than 20 literary
awards for wine writing, including Wine Writer of the Year and the
authorship of the Sotheby's World Wine Encyclopedia.
But he stands out in a field noted for obfuscation and pretension with
his clear, accessible style. His guide boasts an easy-to-use medal
system which lists his best reds, whites, sparklers, fortified wines,
and beers in each supermarket and he defends the relatively small
numbers listed by pointing out that you have to pick your way through
hundreds of underperforming wines and beers to find the real bargains.
''It is my job to do that for you,'' he says.
Stevenson does not mince his words. Liebfraumilch drinkers, he
believes, should be given help to shake their habit. Italy, he declares,
must have more dirty, disgusting wines per square mile than any other
country. Muscadet, a particular bete noire, is condemned as not worth
buying at any price. His suggested alternative is lemon juice and water.
Conversely, he puts up flags for Chardonnays, despite the current
''ABC'' (Anything But Chardonnay) fashion among wine writers, and
maintained that his blind tasting of ports was ''superb, except that I
had to get the Black &amp; Decker out to clean my teeth''.
Although primarily designed as a handy guide for the drinks aisles,
Superbooze contains many fascinating nuggets. Did you know, for instance
that the ''family vineyard'' of Ernest and Julio Gallo churns out the
equivalent of one-and-a-half times the annual wine production of the
entire continent of Australia? Or how a widget works?
These wine consumers who retain the services of their own merchant to
advise them of the newest pleasures will probably not feel the need of
this book. But if you still have to push your own trolley, it could be a
rewarding companion.
* Superbooze 1996, Tom Stevenson, Faber &amp; Faber, #4.99.

Anvar Khan recalls how a quiet walk in leafy glades became the
catalyst for a disquieting obsesssion.
THE more I write about beauty, the more I think I should practise what
I preach. I lie depressed in my bed now, when I remember I got there
without cleansing my face. Not only do I think I'm letting my pores
down, but that I am entertaining hypocrisy.
It was with this weakness of mind, that I walked round Milngavie
reservoir the other day, letting the wind tint my cheeks. This season is
the prettiest, providing a carpet of reds, golds, yellows, copper,
browns, greens and Dalmatian leaves which have been infected with Dutch
Elm disease. Nature is soundly colour-co-ordinated, I mused, like an
interior decorator who's taken too many drugs. And it was then, at that
point, I thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of the
detritus and home-make a pot-pourri.
I'm not usually such a hippy. I always wear a suit to the office and I
think new age travellers should get a job. It's just that I thought I
would be making some sense of the chaos the natural environment allows.
I mean, I thought aloud, while the master of the house marched in front,
I'm recycling what will decompose. Someone made a fortune out of
scenting dried flowers and seeds and selling them by the poke, which I
wish I'd thought of. Hell, I'm saving money.
I stooped here and there, selecting acorns, horse chestnuts, mini fir
cones, and a rainbow of dead plant life. Sir is a very tolerant man, but
even he got peeved when I inadvertently added a half-hour of dawdling on
to an otherwise brisk walk. ''What the hell are you doing, you bam?'' he
shouted back from a half-mile in front, as I bent over again. He loves
me really. ''I am making an autumnal pot-pourri,'' I returned, in a
civilised tone of surprise, as if he should have heard of the practice.
I should have remembered, however, that Protestants are wary of anything
called pot-pourri. ''A whit?''
Men are similar to pets. It's not until you get home that you realise
what you've taken on. There is always the threat of an insect with a
Linford Christie sprint when you shoplift al fresco, and the subsequent
contamination of houseplants. So artistic bits of bark and twig went
straight into the bathroom sink for a rinse.
A copy of last week's paper was inconveniently located in this week's
pile, as usual, and spread on the floor outside the loo in the hall,
upon which ingredients were laid out to dry. Sir, at this point, while I
pottered about the flat, had taken to standing in alternate doorways,
eyeing me carefully.
''So what's the story, then?'' he smiled.
''I'm going to mix them up and put them in that pot mum gave me that I
don't like,'' I said, avoiding the question, mindful of the risk of
confirming that women are on a different wavelength.
Later on, through the night, he clodhopped through the whole lot
barefoot. ''Christ!'' I heard him bellow. Now I know how my pot-pourri
should smell. Heaven-scent.
* LITTLE Women is a range of AA cup lingerie and swimwear available by
mail order. While much has been made of the fact that women are getting
bigger, no-one has mentioned so far, and not surprisingly, that some
women are actually getting smaller, which is a bit of a shame. Take
Debbie Mays for example, Little Women's managing director. She claims
she ''was sick at having to buy dull, unsophisticated 'teenage' bras''
and had spent ''years searching for a genuinely attractive feminine bra
that fitted well.'' It is rather a long time to spend hunting. We've
heard all about the search for Mr Right, but finding Ms Right and Left

EVERY women gets her mother's legs and it's not fair. This is why I
favour scissors of black opaque. Boots have a new range of sheer hosiery
called Premier Collection Patterns at #5.99, for those whose parents
really were storks.
Why pay extra, however, for patterned tights, when all the signs that
you have inherited bulging veins are there. Boots have three exclusive
designs. I don't know why the company believe that come the festive
season, women want to celebrate by decorating their delicate/stumpy
cotton buds but they do.
Garter and Seam -- these tights look like stockings. They have a seam
up the back and a fake lacey border. When worn with a short skirt, Boots
say they are ''fun and flirty'', but I say they're slutty. Ideal,
however, for any woman who wants the look of stockings but not the
insecurity or sass of wearing them.
Scroll -- a bold, abstract, leafy vine on a sheer background, the only
things missing are the grapes.
Nouveau -- Boots say this design is ''a work of art'', but have
substituted the word art, as many do, for something they don't
understand. Beauty Box understands completely. We see dribbling amoebic
blobs, in the way of army camouflage, as if the legs have been lashed
with seaweed. Ideal for a date with Swamp Thing, or as cover when things
go wrong.
* The Boots Premier Collection Patterns range is available from early
November in larger Boots stores.

* THERE has been a culture change regarding diamonds. Like quondam
film star Liz Taylor, a living trailer for the stone herself, its
proponents seem to have given up on men. The Diamond Information Centre
tell us that ''over the past 15 years women are becoming braver and more
discerning about buying diamonds for themselves''. Just tell them to
start saving up as soon as they meet you. You could wait forever for him
to buy you one, after all.
There's adoration and there's adornment, and jewellery brings each
closer. For those suffering from an allergy, Boots have launched a new
range of nickel-free in matt silver and matt gold, and black enamel with
taupe, olive and cocoa-coloured beads. The range is called Solutions.
Prices range from #3.99 to #19.99.

Joe Donnelly marvels at a mechanism which will make the world a
smaller place.
SOME people want to be a big wheel, while others are content to be
cogs. This picture shows what is probably the smallest gear wheel ever
built. It's the size of a grain of pollen, smaller than the diameter of
a human hair . . . and it actually works.
The picture might look like a cartoon or computer simulation, but the
wheels are real. This microengine gear meshes with one 30 times bigger
than itself and drives it to open tiny shutters and power actual
machinery.
It's powered by the first micromotor to drive external gearing and be
built entirely by microelectronic fabrication techniques, say
researchers at Sandia National Laboratories who designed and built the
tiny motor and its gears.
In the race to make the world a smaller place -- as far as appliances
are concerned -- this takes pole position. An engine barely the size of
a pinhead could change the world.
''We believe we are the first to demonstrate a really good silicon
micromotor that can connect up with a variety of devices,'' says Jeff
Sniegowski, the scientist who led a team of engineers to build the
millimetre-square engine and its even tinier gearing.
''Our idea here was to develop a generic micromotor that has a gear
output, so people see there's a power source they can hook up an
application to,'' says Sniegowski. ''This device works, and works
well.''
In a video playback of the operation the large wheel, which has two
holes, functions as an optical shutter because a beam of light can pass
through its openings in some positions but not others. In other video
footage, the smaller gear -- smaller than the diameter of a human hair
-- turns two similarly sized wheels at the phenomenal rate of 200,000
revolutions per minute.
The Sandia team hope that within a few months they'll have a reliable
enough microengine that runs with a useful long life. So far, several
hundred million rotations have been demonstrated by the smaller gears
and the motor which develops 0.5 microwatts of power could be used to
operate appliances like tiny micromedical pumps that function as drug
delivery systems inside the body.
They could also be used to act as low-cost, high-performance
gyroscopes that could have a dramatic impact on the design of future
automobiles and military systems offering miniature and highly accurate
guidance systems. The development team built the micromotor with etching
processes and silicon materials already in use by the microelectronics
industry, so that mass production of the motor should be relatively
easy.
The device is the first micromotor to be built with three levels of
polycrystalline silicon -- a jumbled version of ordinary silicon. The
first level contains the engine, the second the gears that the engine
drives, and the third the linkages that connects everything up. The main
difficulty lies in the fact that they're 100 times thinner than a sheet
of paper. One main advantage is that its tiny mass means it can survive
impact better, making it a robust little powerhouse.
The Sandia engine and gearing take the micromotor evolution several
steps up the scale -- or downward sizewise -- and the batch process of
mass production would produce thousands of fully assembled, operational
microengines.
Tiny, robust, powerful and controlled by microchips, these little
machines could soon be working not only near you, but inside the body,
delivering drugs, or even seeking out and clearing blockages and perhaps
even taking samples of tissue without the need for intrusive surgery at
all.

* GERMAN psychologists seem to have taken on board the motto from the
crack TV series The X Files.
The Institut fur Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene in
Freiburg, Germany, have awarded a massive $250,000 grant to Virginia
researchers to study the near-death experiences of heart attack
patients.
''Unusual near-death experiences, such as a feeling of leaving the
body or seeing a bright light, are often accompanied by after-effects
that shift life's perspective after such experiences,'' said Dr Bruce
Greyson, professor of psychiatry at Virginia University.
''Patients may lose their fear of dying or have a decrease in concern
with material possessions,'' he said.
The grant is allegedly to study the after-effects on the well-being of
people who have come close to death.
Patients who have had unusual experiences during hearts attacks of
various types will be compared with others who have had heart attacks,
but no such experiences.
The third category, those not now able to communicate through normal
channels, are naturally not included.
However, the Virginia shrinks plan to use their huge grant to expand
their catchment beyond the coronary circle. They've decided to take
responses from other close encounters, and close calls, such as near
drownings, road accidents, and electrocutions.
As Mulder and Scully might say: ''The truth is out there . . . and
there's money in it.''

* HERE'S an idea that's not very hi-tech but needed the electronic age
to make it happen. It takes us back to the days when all grannies wore
rainmates to stay dry on drizzly days.
This is the Aquapac and it's a dead-cert winner for biz-o-holics who
just can't bear to be parted from their mobile phones, even if they're
under water at the time.
Aquapac is a range of plastic bags. Not your common carrier but a new
range of waterproof cases designed to protect everything from mobile
phones and cameras, to electronic games and personal stereos.
You know how it is. You're sitting there by the beach, playing third
level Sonic, listening to Blur while on the phone to your broker, when
some nerd in a Gazza haircut and fast boat gives you an early shower.
All the electronics are up in smoke at the first splash.
The Aquapac is designed to prevent all that. In fact the vendors,
Aquaman, say its the hi-tech era's answer to sand, snow, sun or rain,
allowing full use of electronic accessories without the risk of damage.
Pictures can be taken, or phone calls made without even opening the
bag.
The Aquapacs will even float with the equipment inside, freeing hands
for valuable motions like waving for help or swimming.
The mobile phone bag is guaranteed 100% waterproof down to 15 ft in
seawater.
However, if sporty children insist you scuba, you can always while the
time playing the Game Boy. The waterproof bag also allows game addicts
to use the things in the bath, which makes the #9-#12 cost seem
reasonable.
Apparently the personal stereo system case allows you to listen to
Handel's water music while annoying the rest of the folk on Loch Lomond.
The cases withstand temperatures as high as 90 degrees Celcius or as
cold as a mother-in-law's breath.
In the old days they'd have been great for keeping a working man's
pieces dry.

* NONE of us have ever watched an illegally copied video tape, so we
wouldn't know how annoying the blurry quality of the picture can be.
This is often caused by a process which lets the tapes play properly but
copy badly. Some people are prepared to watch the stuttering and
blurring however, so California company Macrovision have patented a
system that makes them even more unviewable.
The system adds electronic pulses to the synchronisation pulses in TV
signals which when copied, fills the screen with black and white lines.
For any protective technology, there's always an offensive counter
measure, but Macrovision have thought of that. Their system can be
thwarted, electronically but they have patented that system too. Anybody
selling the technology to beat the anti-copier can face legal action.
Neat.
* BUILD a better mousetrap, so the saying goes, and the world will
beat a path to your door. Change mousetrap for Aspirin, and the path
could become a motorway. It's the world's oldest painkiller, initially a
derivative of the willow tree.
Unfortunately its side effect causes irritation of the stomach lining
and can lead in some cases to ulcers. Now scientists have discovered how
the aspirin molecule blocks the activation of enzymes which activates
pain transmission. It also inhibits a similar enzyme, thus causing the
side effects. Now after thousands of years of use, there's a chance that
a new aspirin molecule can be designed to do the one job, without
causing the stomach problems.
* THE 11-year cycle of sunspots -- storms on the face of the sun which
cause radio interference -- seems to have got out of synch and started
more than a year earlier than expected. Astrophysicists identified the
first new sunspot several weeks ago. It's recognisable as part of the
new cycle because its magnetic polarity is the reverse of the previous
set. The information, from observers in California, seems to be
accurate. Sunspots also cause auroras in the night sky. Your
frontiersman had the pleasure of witnessing the northern lights as far
south as Dumbarton only days ago.
* A JAPANESE scientist has used the ancient art of origami to design
nano-bots, tiny remote controlled robots which could eventually carry
out microsurgery. The microtechnologist at Tokyo University folded
sheets of polysilicon to design tiny ants, small enough to go through
the eye of a needle. The robotic insects are controlled
electrostatically and can follow instructions. It's planned that the
next generation, too small to be seen by the naked eye, could act in
concert, connecting nerves and blood vessels inside the human body, or
even building electrical connections small enough for the next huge
advance in computer technology.

MULTI--MEDIA
* OLD staid Auntie Beeb is hauling herself into the 21st century, just
in time. The BBC is setting up the UK's first multi-media centre.
Planned to be be the focus for the future digital age, it will be
housed in a new high-tech building at television centre.
BBC news chiefs say the plunge into the news revolution will enable
people to create their own news programmes by linking with the
multi-media news centre on PC to call up headlines and stories.
''It will be like having a Martin Bell or Kate Adie (pictured left)
filing stories and background pieces for your personal news service,''
says Tony Hall, director of news and current affairs.
The service is expected to be on line by 1997 in what is described as
the world's most advanced electronic newsroom system. It will link the
Beeb's radio and TV journalists and archives in the next evolutionary
step to the Ceefax teletext which is a basic prototype of an interactive
news service.
Over the next couple of years both sound and pictures will all be
retrievable on screen at a speed high enough to allow broadcasting
companies to develop real state of the art interactive news services,
and one, according to the BBC, where the viewer can shape the running
order.
Hall claims that the next great leap for audiences will be news
tailored to what the audience wants, not what broadcasters decide,
allowing viewers to choose the news they want to hear.
Sounds like a brave new world of constant O J Simpson trials and
national lottery . . . with the bold Kate Adie on tap for the view from
the killing fields.

THE FLYING BANKER
If it's Tuesday, it must be Sanday - all part of a regular run for one
of the financial world's most adventrous travellers. Gavin Bell sees how
business is conducted in Scotland's far-flung outposts.
THE little Islander aircraft has been flying for about 15 minutes,
passing over a patchwork of low-lying green islands in a dark blue sea.
From the narrow cabin, with its full complement of eight passengers, one
can clearly see a mosaic of cultivated fields and farmyards, fishing
boats sheltering in small harbours, and seals basking in the late autumn
sunshine.
As if choosing one of the isles at random, the plane banks over a
deserted beach of white sand, and begins to lose height. It is rocking
slightly in a strong headwind, and seems to be heading directly for a
farmyard. There is no runway to be seen, because there isn't one.
Sweeping low over a herd of cows, which scatters at its approach, the
plane clears a dry-stone dyke and lands surprisingly smoothly in a grass
field. A bearded man in oilskins and woollen bunnet walks over from a
tractor, hands up a sack of mail, and complements the pilot: ''Good
flying, Miller.''
A young woman clutching a locked briefcase steps from the plane and is
greeted by the islander: ''A wee bit breezy the day, Anne.'' In fact the
wind is gusting to 40 knots, but Anne Rendall hardly notices it. As the
''flying banker'' of Orkney, serving clients of the Royal Bank of
Scotland in the sparsely-populated North Isles, she is accustomed to
being stranded by force 8 winter gales and horizontal rain.
Her predecessor, Maisie Muir, earned a place in the Guinness Book of
Records by clocking up more than 8400 flights. Anne has some way to go
to match her, having recorded a mere 1000 flights in the past six years.
On Wednesdays and Fridays she flies from her base in Kirkwall to
Westray, on Thursdays she's on Stronsay, and on Mondays once a month she
is on the world's shortest scheduled flight -- about 100 seconds --
between Westray and Papa Westray. But today is Tuesday, so this is
Sanday.
There is a stark beauty to the island, with no hills and few trees to
disturb the symmetry of its low profile between huge skies and endless
seas. Shaped like a land-crab scuttling across the North Sea, its claws
shelter the finest beaches in Orkney. It also has some of the most
fertile land, which was attracting farmers before the Egyptians got
around to building pyramids.
Farming is still the main economic activity of the population of about
500, most of whom know Anne, which makes her job easier and more
pleasant: ''I like the personal contact, it's much better than speaking
over the telephone or through a glass screen,'' she says. ''It's also
good to catch up on the latest gossip.'' News of forthcoming galas,
dances, and weddings are important because it helps her to plan how much
money to take to each island -- particularly small change for the
purveyors of liquid refreshments.
It also helps that she comes from one of the North Isles herself, Papa
Westray (population 70), where her father and her elder brother are
farmers. Having been raised in this community, she knows how it works
and how to deal with its problems. ''I think people find it easier to
discuss things with me in private, than with a stranger across a counter
in Kirkwall,'' she says.
She was always good with figures at Kirkwall Grammar School, and in
due course her teacher put her name forward for a vacancy as a bank
junior. ''In fact four of us got jobs with the bank then,'' she recalls,
''but that would never happen now. A lot of the work is computerised,
and there are less jobs. But that's a chronic problem on the islands.''
When she goes home to Papa Westray on business, her ''office'' is a
spare room in a private house whose owner also provides lunch. On
Sanday, the Royal Bank outpost is a prefabricated white cabin with three
rooms on the shore at Kettletoft, a straggle of houses that is the
closest thing on the island to a village.
From the windows, Anne looks out over a sea loch, its waters tranquil
by the shore but flecked white with wind-driven waves further out. On a
patch of grass next door, a tethered sheep is grazing beneath a fishing
boat raised on stocks. The rocky shore is littered with the rusting
debris of farm implements and fishing tackle, and the predominant sounds
are of the wind and the sea.
In her office, Anne switches on a transistor radio and Jimmy Young
burbles away quietly in a corner as she attends to the business of the
day. The first customer is an elderly man in dungarees and tweed jacket,
his weather-beaten face and rough hands testifying to a life of farming,
who has come to deposit a small amount of cash. ''Breezy the day,'' he
says in the peculiar sing-song accent of Orkney, more akin to a Welsh
lilt than a Scots burr. Anne agrees, and asks after his family.
The next customer begins to write a cheque, but can't remember the
date. ''It doesn't really matter most of the time, so I don't think
about it,'' she says. In the waiting room, half a dozen people are
exchanging news about cattle sales, and lobster fishing, and a dance
being organised by the Strathspey and Reel society. A woman says: ''When
we meet here after a week, we have a chat. It's like a wee social
club.''
There is a high proportion of English voices. One of them belongs to a
sprightly old woman from Barnsley who has joined the local fiddle club,
which meets on Saturday mornings. ''I'm having my second childhood, and
this is a brilliant playground,'' she says. A retired telephone engineer
from Essex says he could not bear to live in England again: ''The air is
so foul you can cut it with a knife, and the traffic's so bad they've
got roundabouts at the end of cul-de-sacs. It's terrible.''
Anne understands such sentiments. She enjoys travelling far afield --
she has been to Egypt and Zimbabwe on holiday -- but she is always glad
to come home. ''It's partly the wildlife, and the flowers and the sea.
The colours here are amazing, the blues and the greens. But it's mostly
because the people are so friendly. There's a real community spirit
here, the folk next door actually care about you.''
It is not all sweetness and light on these remote islands, of course,
although there is a good deal of both in the meadows in the spring and
summer. The winters are long and dark, and some incomers in particular
find it hard to cope with the gloom and the gales and the solitude. An
islander explains what happens when storms come howling out of the
Atlantic: ''It's always the lee side of the roof that comes off first,
the wind just seems to sook it off.''
Another complains about settlers who bring their baggage of urban
stresses with them: ''They come here with their hang-ups, and keep their
distance and say give me space. How much space do they need?'' He
gestures over a vista of fields in which only two houses are to be seen.
''And some of them come here just to live in a nice place and draw their
dole through the post. These ones we can do without.''
Anne agrees that the character of Orcadian communities is changing,
with young folk leaving to find work and being replaced by older people
from the British mainland -- almost half of the population of Sanday is
now believed to be of English origin. ''The Orkney dialect is beginning
to be blended out and that's a shame,'' she says. ''But it's happening
everywhere in Scotland, I suppose.''
David Miller, the pilot of the Islander, is philosophical about the
changing face of his native Kirkwall. ''You've got to have new blood,
otherwise the islands will go stale. And those who do stay become native
after a while, they become very laid back about things.''
Bill McArthur is a cheerful case in point. He is a big, shaggy man in
a big, shaggy pullover who came to Sanday from Kintyre almost 20 years
ago to be a shark fisherman. A man of many talents, he wrung the salt
water from his blood last December and replaced it with printer's ink.
The fruit of his new labours may be familiar to readers of The Herald as
the political cartoons signed ''Bill'', which he transmits
electronically from a converted barn at the north end of the island.
''I'm the biggest pocket cartoonist in Britain,'' he boasts.
It is the variety of customers like Bill, and a former leader of the
Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra now teaching the fiddle on Sanday, that
is the spice of Anne's professional life. ''Every island has its
characters, with their stories to tell,'' she says. ''There's never a
dull moment.''
Given her mode of transport, and the uncertain weather conditions,
this is possibly an understatement. She recalls watching the Islander
trying in vain to land on Westray in a fierce gale: ''It was just
hovering like a helicopter, it couldn't get down. The cars were shaking
in the wind, so we knew it was quite strong. We were amazed he came out
at all.''
On another occasion she was stranded on Stronsay by thick fog, and
chartered a fishing boat along with other passengers keen to reach
Kirkwall that day. ''Just as we left, the wind blew up from the
south-east and the sea got a bit rough. There were a few white faces
about.''
The weather is more settled today. Apart from a distant smudge of rain
on the horizon, the skies are clear and land and sea are washed with
clean, bright light. But the wind is gaining in strength, and the
Islander's arrival for the afternoon flight back to Kirkwall draws
laconic approval from a local wit at the landing field: ''Miller's a dab
hand at putting that thing down on one wheel, right enough.''
A flock of gulls rises from a field as we climb away from Sanday, but
two swans glide serenely, undisturbed, on an inland lake. The shallows
around the coast are translucent cobalt, more like the Caribbean than
the North Sea, but treacherous currents are apparent in deeper waters.
After she has done her accounts for the day, Anne intends to tidy her
flat in Kirkwall and maybe go out for a drink with friends. She enjoys
live music, and hardly misses an event at annual folk and classical
festivals, but this is a quiet week in the local entertainment calendar.
It's just as well, because she has an early start in the morning.
Tomorrow is Wednesday, so it must be Westray.

Sabbath's Theater by Philip Roth.
Cape, #15.99
ONE of the few things Mickey Sabbath turned down was an offer from Jim
Henson. More than 30 years ago, over lunch on the Upper East Side, he
was invited to join Henson's band of four or five puppeteers who were
starting Sesame Street. Had Sabbath accepted, he could have occupied Big
Bird.
Now he is trying to deal with death, with anger, bitterness and the
sense of failure that comes in its wake. Long ago, his Croatian
mistress, Drenka, shamed her parents by running off to America to
indulge her love of money and fun. She has suddenly died of ovarian
cancer, leaving Sabbath to ponder the loss of a partner whose sexual
appetite and preferences were as insatiable as his own.
Even from the grave she is enticing. Her memory, he says, makes him
feel 20 again. Which is part of Mickey Sabbath's problem; he is in
flight from reality and part of his difficulty is an inability to see
women as anything other than sexual objects. He is also incapable of
learning from his past.
He is a 64-year-old failed puppeteer with arthritic hands. Events and
time have overtaken him. Even the sexual revolution came as a mixed
blessing. What it gave with one hand it took away with the other, so
that greater sexual freedom and promiscuity was following by feminism
and political correctness.
In his younger days it was very much easier. The issues were simpler.
It was art, which had to be defended against Philistinism. It was a
cause for freedom of expression against an outdated morality. When he
was puppet master of the Indecent Theater of Manhattan, Sabbath was
arrested for manipulating his finger puppets into unbuttoning a girl's
blouse and exercising the contents of her bra. She appeared in court on
his behalf, taking the stand against censorship and oppression,
advocating self-expression and art.
In 1989, Sabbath was publicly disgraced for the gross sexual
harassment of a girl 40 years his junior. His wife became a patient in a
psychiatric institution because of the alcoholic breakdown brought on by
the scandal.
Mickey Sabbath is the latest addition to Roth's catalogue of
emotionally crippled men who can easily be dismissed in terms of their
sexual appetites and obsessions. As in the past, he is using these
things to produce a testament of his country and its times, which may be
why the American spellings have been retained, but that could also have
to do with laziness and cost. In this ruthless analysis of cause and
effect, he is comparable only to himself. Having previously covered the
ground so brilliantly, he is once more revolting and hilarious, tragic
and tedious. He is also sadly accurate.
But times have changed for Roth as for Sabbath and such a one-sided
analysis of gender behaviour became unfashionable long ago. Sabbath's
inability to come to terms with, or even to understand, his past, or his
failure to protect himself from the aspects he finds too awful to face,
does not excuse his appalling behaviour, which he cannot justify even to
himself.
He is grieving for his life, for the inevitability of old age and the
disappearance of those he loved, though there is little to suggest his
behaviour was ever reasonable.
His rage makes him even more extreme. The concluding pages move from
tenderness and loss to a rush of life, saving the pay-off for a final,
savage line.

CRIME ROUND-UP
THE HOUR OF OUR DEATH, Alison Joseph, Headline, #16.99
* THERE are strange goings-on in a London teaching hospital. An
unexplained death, dealt with rather more expeditiously than the
circumstances seemed to warrant, soon becomes just one incident out of a
number. The first-person amateur detective, to whose thoughts we are
privy throughout, is of French origin. Agnes, a nun for some 16 years,
aims to solve the mystery and liaises with a failed artist but with
greatness in him, called Tom, who has been commissioned to paint the
about-to-retire head of the hospital. Her feelings for Tom become more
and more un-nunlike and her other aides are an old girlfriend, and a
female medical student. The pace is slow but methodical -- and none the
less enjoyable for that -- with a satisfyingly believable conclusion.
BEYOND THE SILENCE, Ted Allebury, Hodder and Stoughton, #16.99
* The SIS know that Lord Carling, who started working for them after
the war, had left-wing views before and perhaps during it. Even since
his retirement, a higher proportion of his visits abroad on behalf of
the Arts Council than might perhaps be warranted have been to Eastern
Europe. Has he, as they put it, been ''playing footsie'' with the
Russians, and if so from when until when? Timothy Mathews is deputed by
the SIS to become close to Carling in order to discover the truth, the
object being to enable them to judge whether a confession would be worth
their offering complete immunity in exchange. We, the reader, not only
have the advantage of looking over Mathews's shoulder as he carries out
his task but also of reading flashbacks which confirm, refute, or expand
on his findings. The combination makes for a superb story, the real-life
third man, Philby, figuring throughout both in factual account and in
fictional surmise.
SIMEON'S BRIDE, Alison G Taylor, Hale, #16.99
* THIS opens with the discovery of a decaying corpse swinging
gruesomely from a high branch in a piece of deserted woodland, which is
situated in a district with a long history of murder by hanging. The
detectives are the members of the local police force of various ranks,
most of whom already have uncomfortable home lives to contend with. The
unravelling of the various mysteries is absorbing, the characters
well-drawn and the writing has a highly distinctive style.

PAPERBACKS
IT ALL ADDS UP: From the Dim Past to the Uncertain Future, Saul
Bellow, Penguin, #5.99.
* FIFTY years of journalism, essays, interviews, and lectures by the
noblest Chicagoan of them all, ranging over subjects from footnote
characters of the Windy City to world politics, it all adds up to a lot,
yet less than a fan of Bellow's fiction might have hoped for. The
smaller and more personal the subject, the better Bellow is; but when he
puts on his I Chose Freedom hat, he's little more than a less pompous
Solzhenitsyn -- which still leaves him plenty of room for pomposity, at
that. Unmissable, but disappointing.
THE DYLAN THOMAS OMNIBUS, Phoenix, #9.99.
* ALL the Dylan Thomas that anyone but an obsessive could want is
contained in this big selection box of poems, stories, and broadcasts
(including Under Milk Wood). His wildly uneven and sometimes fraudulent
poetry is well winnowed down, leaving only the best and the good, and
the choice of stories (his finest but most neglected work) is more
generous than in any other Thomas anthology I've seen. The roaring boyo
deserves to be rescued from his worshippers, and that's what this book
does.
THE ANATOMY LESSON, Philip Roth, Vintage, #5.99.
* PHILIP Roth's alter-ego, Nathan Zuckerman -- the voracious
philanderer, guilt-ridden secular Jew, and self-obsessed literary
intellectual whom we first met in My Life As A Man -- is at his most
exasperating, most likable, and finally most grown-up in this 1983
misadventure, the story of a long psychosomatic backache that leads him,
through the bleak comedy of sickness and treatment, to recognise that
there really are other people in the world and that many of them are
much worse off than he is. This is Roth's most moving and egalitarian
novel, sounding deep notes of common humanity while hanging on to the
wild humour of his earlier confessionals.
THE NEON BIBLE, John Kennedy Toole, Penguin, #5.99.
* REPRINTED to tie in with the release of Terence Davies's film, John
Kennedy Toole's first, teenage novel (he killed himself in 1969 at the
age of 32, depressed by finding no publisher for the second, A
Confederacy of Dunces) only goes to prove how unjustly treated the poor
devil was. If anything, this look-back-in-anguish story of growing up in
America's Bible Belt in the 1940s is an even better novel than the
brilliant A Confederacy -- it's up there with The Catcher in the Rye, or
perhaps more pertinently Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood. The cruelty and
viciousness of the narrower perversions of Christianity have never been
so poignantly anatomised, nor America's invisible class system so
pitifully exposed.
THE GUINNESS DICTIONARY OF JOKES, Nigel Rees (ed), #6.99.
* ONE of those books whose existence is more remarkable than its
quality -- like Dr Johnson's dog on two legs -- this collection of weary
quips proves conclusively that jokes are the corpse of humour. Hard to
say what's more depressing: the idea of reading it for fun, or of
someone memorising bits of it to set next day's teabreak on a roar.

BLOODSTAINED KINGS.
Tim Willocks
Jonathan Cape, #14.99
UNTIL this man put pen to paper, Raymond Chandler was probably the
only English writer with the talent, the wherewithal, and the sheer
bottle to write a convincing hard-boiled contemporary American crime
novel. And Chandler didn't count because, to all intents and purposes,
he was American. He lived there, worked there, and walked down those
mean streets.
Tim Willocks is different. For a start, he is English-based. What he
demonstrates here, however, is an abiding love and an enormous respect
for modern American fiction. His reference points, his influences, are
clearly the works of writers like Elmore Leonard, James Lee Burke, and
(perhaps most of all) Pete Dexter. If he keeps this standard up, then
pretty soon he'll be as good as any of them.
Willocks's knowledge of modern America (particularly its dark,
crime-laden underbelly) is consummate but he is not in the business of
showing off about it. He simply tells a powerful story like it is.
This is Willocks's third novel; all have been set in America's Deep
South. The first, Bad City Blues, was a superb thriller, scandalously
ignored by the critics. The second, Green River Rising, a savage
thriller set in a high-security Florida prison, provided a disturbing
insight in to the darkest side of the American male psyche (it was a
bestseller and is soon to be made into a movie).
An odious spectre haunts each page of Bloodstained Kings. The long
black shadow of lawman Clarence Jefferson, missing presumed dead, is
cast over every word, every deed, every thought. Jefferson was no
paragon of probity. He was a bad man who carried out his share of
torture and killing.
Along the way, like some evil magpie, he collected evidence of crime
and wrongdoing perpetrated by those who considered themselves to be his
intellectual and social masters. In short, he had the goods -- a corpus
delicti of fabulous proportion -- on all the major players of his
parish. The local politicians, the rich businessmen, the cops, and even
the Mob.
Now, with Jefferson apparently dead, the hunt is on for his secret
trove of damning evidence. But from the grave, the mischievious lawman
bequeaths his treasure to the last man in the world who wants it. Dr
Cicero Grimes, a psychiatrist and former adversary, is charged with the
task of taking Jefferson's testimony to the media and, thereby, bringing
the wrongdoers to their knees. Take it to the Washington Post then buy
yourself a TV and watch the fun.
Along the way the reluctant Grimes must face villainous cops, Mafia
gangsters, and (most dangerous of all) Lenna Parillaud, a beautiful yet
merciless businesswoman in search of her missing daughter. Matters
become complicated when his estranged father, a former union boss,
decides to lend a hand in an attempt to recapture a glory long lost to
him. When the old man disappears with Parillaud's missing child, Grimes
embarks upon a desperate journey across three states towards the final
confrontation with the bloodstained kings.
Willocks's striking novel is stylish and near perfectly-crafted. This
is a book which is more, much more, than a crime novel. It is a
terrifying exploration of the desperate measures which the rich and
powerful will take when faced with the dawning of a final judgment day.
Bloodstained Kings is the product of a wonderfully twisted imagination.

MILLENNIUM: A History of our Last Thousand Years.
Felipe Fernandez-Armesto
Bantam Press, #25
THE classic definition of chutzpah is the man accused of murdering his
parents who urges the court to show him mercy because he is an orphan.
Felipe Fernandez-Armesto has made an impressive attempt to trump that:
writing a history of the last thousand years in just more than 800
pages, leaving room, of course, for copious illustrations, an index, a
comprehensive notes section, and a mordant epilogue.
When reading history, first look at the historian. Fernandez-Armesto
is a member of the Modern History Faculty of Oxford University whose
previous books include Columbus and Barcelona: a Thousand Years of the
City's Past. This would indicate a Western bias but, on the contrary,
the author leans heavily on the influence of the East and particularly
Islam.
With this emphasis, some subjects are treated in cursory fashion,
notably the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Irish
Famine.
Fernandez-Armesto seems to agree with Chou-en-Lai who, when asked
about the importance of the French Revolution, replied: ''It is too
early to say''. The Irish Famine is only referred to as a cause for
emigration.
However, to dwell on these omissions would be to review a book that
has not been written. It is more rewarding to concentrate on what
Fernandez-Armesto has set out to accomplish and to marvel at the
intellectual and moral consistency which he has employed to write a book
which is informative, provocative, entertaining, and surprisingly witty.
Disagreement with many of the theses perversely adds to rather than
detracts from the enjoyment of the book.
The themes ebb and flow on the domination of oceans throughout the era
and a most persuasive case he makes for his contentions on the return to
the pre-eminence of the Pacific.
He is particularly strong on religion, describing the Crusades as a
fleabite on the hide of Islam. His views on the strength of Islam and
the schisms of Christianity are in tune with the rest of the book --
bold and well-argued. There is hardly a better sentence in the book
than: ''It was a common mistake of twentieth-century intellectuals to
suppose God was dead and religion must wither.'' Much blood has been
spilled, and continues to be spilled, proving the error of that belief.
This is no weighty tome but rather a series of pithy essays.
The book is sprinkled with arresting portraits of forgotten men. Who
could resist being introduced to Vlodomir, ruler of Kiev, who had the
reputation in German annals of being a fornicator immensus et crudelis?
Or Mansa of Mali, strong in war and wares? Or Fernando Mendes Pinto, the
Portuguese Sinbad, who survived shipwrecks, slaughters, and storms? Or
John Brown (no, not the one whose body lies a mouldering) of Providence,
Rhode Island, who in the 1770s launched a series of speculative ventures
in slaves and rum, pig iron, and whale products?
The weakest section, and the author anticipates criticism of this, is
the epilogue where he sets out his views on the future. The Russian
Minister Gromyko had the most sensible view of the futility of
theorising on what might have been. When asked by an earnest American
journalist what would have happened if 1963 if Kruschev rather than
Kennedy had been assassinated, the wily politico replied: ''Aristotle
Onassis would not have married Mrs Kruschev.''
History writing may not be the new rock and roll, but
Fernandez-Armesto has joined Simon Scharma and Paul Kennedy in proving
it can be readable, relevant and delightfully contentious.

THE BEAUTY OF THE BEASTLY.
Natalie Angier
Little Brown, #17.50
SUBTITLED ''more views on the nature of life'', and starring on its
cover a winsome green frog, this book is a collection of articles,
mostly from the New York Times, and mostly about animals, except for
those that discuss humankind in animal terms. Natalie Angier mines this
vein for a living and has won such prestigious awards as the Pulitzer
Prize.
It's good writing. She uses short sentences, telling detail, and
enjoys a light touch in humour.These are not articles; these are essays,
a form of writing almost extinct for competence, but which she does
superbly well. So we learn about cheetahs (and their chromosomes), and
we celebrate the cockroach, and we meet a thing called the aye-aye,
which is a lemur from Madagascar, and in serious danger of extinction.
Angier's thoughts on matters human, once she reaches them, are also
worth having. Her little essay on suicide ends with a typically sharp
insight into the depressive personality. Depression ''could be the
inevitable downside of a personality that offers great pay-offs when
times are good. In the case of the rhesus monkey, the same animals that
are susceptible to depression often rise to the top of the social
hierarchy because of their heightened sensory and emotional sensitivity
. . . They see and hear and smell everything. They are like taut strings
on a beautiful violin. If bowed too hard, the strings will snap.''
It is a book that will make you think, and a book worth having, even
if -- like me -- you don't entirely follow Angier in entirely equating
humanity with the animal kingdom.

Writer and actor Forbes Masson describes his latest nocturnal reading
choices to ANN DONALD.
I'VE been leading a bit of a transient lifestyle at the moment between
London and Glasgow so I suppose I should really be reading something by
Jack Kerouac. I was renting a house when I was doing The Trick Is To
Keep Breathing at The Tron recently, playing a psychiatrist and there
were conveniently a lot of self-help books there. There was one American
book by Louise L. Hay called Love Yourself, Heal Your Life.
In the first chapter it focuses on ''deservability'' and says
something along the lines of, ''Don't say that you hate your old car --
say I love my old car and I deserve a new one!'' So far my D-reg Nissan
hasn't turned into a Lotus Elan, so it's not really working.
There's one called Feel The Fear and Do It Anyway by Susan Jeffers
which I was clutching on the first night at The Tron. Basically it tells
you not to be scared of anything and just go ahead and jump. I tend to
think this is a little dangerous.
I've also been reading Alan Carr's book How To Stop Smoking for the
fifth time and I want my money back. The first time I read it I stopped
smoking for six months but then I got drunk one night and started again.
When I'm in London I read a lot more because of the travelling time on
the tube and the bus. Mind you, I do tend to pick books up and put them
down again very quickly as I've got the attention span of a goldfish
with dementia.

CRY BOSNIA.
Paul Harris.
Canongate Books, #14.95.
MORE than anything, it's about faces and expressions. The wide-eyed
tortured stare of a young mother; the vacant shock of a freshly-made
widow; the ancient eyes of an orphan, mute and motionless in his
hospital bed.
In a conflict characterised by the cold barbarity of bureaucracy, Cry
Bosnia lets the people tell the story, through their eyes and their
gestures and the thin, drawn lines of their faces.
This is not just a book. Its publication also marks the launch of a
charity of the same name which aims to re-start the printing industry in
large parts of the former Yugoslavia, and all royalties will go to
refugee projects in the region.
It's a noble effort from someone who has been transfixed by the
Balkans and few journalists have become as involved in this tragedy as
Paul Harris. He has lived in the region for more than a decade, and the
text charts his almost child-like amazement at the start of the conflict
-- ''what I was witnessing, although I didn't know it at the time, was
ethnic cleansing'' -- to the sense of deep frustration which settles on
him as the war progressed.
The job of reportage is a tricky one, however. There is a perilously
thin line between acting purely as an observer and placing yourself too
much in the frame, and Harris does cross it on several occasions. For
example, we don't need to see the large, hip-handed, camera-bedecked
image of him on the back, or the meaningless little asides which he has
sprinkled throughout the copy.
The book is at its best when he has forgotten himself and the
bureaucrats, officials, and outsiders and concentrates on the people who
matter, the people whose lives have been shaped, shortened or shattered
by this war. Here there is a real sense of honesty and accessibility
about his work. Here he delivers Bosnia as he sees it, and what he sees
is the conflict played out on a thousand faces.
Like little Alen, 4, whose parents are missing behind the lines in
part of Eastern Slavonia taken by the Serbs. He's sitting in his bed in
the children's hospital in Zagreb, staring blankly at the camera. ''The
doctors are apologetic about him,'' writes Harris. ''He is offered a
cuddly toy every day but he prefers his lifesize Kalashnikov replica and
stubbornly fights off all attempts to remove it.''
Or like Namka Hedis, a mother and wife from the village of Hadzici
near Banja Luka, who witnessed the slaughter of her husband and most of
the rest of her village.
''All the men in the village were killed. There were three thousand
men in the area and many were executed that night. Then they started to
rape the women -- mainly the younger women. But the oldest woman I saw
raped was 70 years old. The youngest was 12. Many of the women who were
raped had their throats cut afterwards. I don't know how I survived.''
It is gripping testimony and Harris rightly lets Namka tell her own
tale, commenting only on the unseeing stare of her young daughter, left
mute since the incident.
There is also room for a little humour; the Serbian students accused
of staging a protest for cash who photocopied fake Deutschmarks and
''paid'' themselves; the nun wielding the video camera; the Bosnian
soldier wandering off to war with a guitar slung across his chest.
What there is no room for is the gallery of gruesome images which must
exist, but which we rarely see. Perhaps Harris has tried to protect us
from the worst excesses of the brutality, perhaps he felt dismembered
limbs and spattered blood have become too cliched. Whatever the
reasoning, there is only one bloody shot of three corpses waiting in
line at a Croatian morgue on Christmas Eve.
Neither is there a conclusion to the book, just as there is, as yet,
no conclusion to the war. Instead, we tail off with two poems and the
last picture taken in Srebrenica in July this year. It shows an elderly
couple, the man staring blankly off into the middle distance, the woman
half-turned towards the camera, one large tear rolling down her cheek.
There is no text.
In his preface to the book, Harris quoted Martha Gellhorn, the doyenne
of reportage and witness to some 12 or more bloody conflicts. ''For all
the good our articles did,'' she wrote, ''they might have been written
in invisible ink, printed on leaves, and loosed to the wind.''
For all Cry Bosnia's empathy and its clear-sighted anger, Gellhorn
will probably be proved right. If the Balkans have taught us anything,
it is that we appear to have an extraordinary capacity to witness
suffering on a monumental scale and do absolutely nothing about it.

PARA HANDY SAILS AGAIN.
Stuart Donald
Neil Wilson Publishing, #7.99.
MY CAPTAINS.
Tom Ralston
Scottish Cultural Press, #6.99.
SUNSET ON THE CLYDE.
Duncan Graham,
Neil Wilson Publishing, #7.99
THE shipyards of the Clyde are now floral walkways. The piers where
there was fierce bidding for the catch, or where families joined the
paddle-steamer on Fair Friday, are now rotten. Though the breaker's
torch and the fishing quota have curtailed our history, boats with full
holds and crowded decks continue to sail in the Scottish psyche.
These three books are voyages of recollection, but Stuart Donald sets
himself the hardest course. As he admits: ''A man who is planning to
tamper with a national institution approaches the task with some
trepidation. In Para Handy Sails Again Donald restarts the temperamental
engine of the Vital Spark by adding new stories to the revered canon.
The essence of the Para Handy stories is the circumlocution of Captain
Peter MacFarlane. Neil Munro grew up in Inveraray, and the Gaelic
conversations he overheard between steamer crew, fishermen, and locals
we translated, with accompanying inflection, into the mouth of Para
Handy. Can someone who does not come from an unbroken Gaelic tradition
re-create this old-style dialogue? Stuart Donald makes a brave attempt.
''My Chove, Dougie,'' he said, ''we've not always been such a centre of
attraction in the past! But I've always said, the time would come when
the finer points of the shup would at last be recognised by the public
at large. I'm glad we gave the lum a fresh coat of pent at Tarbert
yesterday mornin', for she's neffer looked bonnier and plainly the news
hass got round.'' This quotation is taken from The Encounter at
Inveraray, where the Vital Spark finds itself alongside a submarine. It
is a subtle contrast, considering the sleekness of the sub-sea craft
compared to the puffer with its polluting smoke-stack and undisciplined
crew. But this story and others in the volume lack the twists of plot
(again a Gaelic characteristic) that we get in the real Munro.
This is an entertaining book, with Neil Munro himself putting in an
appearance, and with Donald showing that he understands the psychology
(sometimes devious) of the west coast mind.
He can certainly evoke the special atmosphere of the Clyde, past as
well as present.
My Captains is autobiography. Tom Ralston was born in Campbeltown and
started as a fisherman in 1950. He recalls characters such as the Foster
brothers, as eccentric and attractive as Para Handy.
''Now the Fosters were well-known to us all, having the alleged habit
of using a bicycle to ride the length of the hall, when anyone knocked
on their door. It was a matter of some honour that the caller should
protest that whichever brother answered the door was not the required
one, which resulted in this poor man having to turn the cycle around,
pedal back down the 15 feet of hallway, and then the whole hilarious
process would start all over again with the 'correct' brother!''
As well as being gripping reading through its strong narrative flow
and memorable characters, My Captains is an important contribution to
Scottish ethnology, showing the hardships (the Antares was sunk by a
submarine) as well as the humour of a fisherman's life round the
Scottish coast and beyond. It's also about environmental change. The
sail-like fins of the muldoans (basking sharks) led the boats to the
shoals of herring. Both have largely disappeared now.
Tom Ralston has led a very varied life apart from fishing:
coxswain/mechanic on the Mallaig lifeboat, a fish buyer in Mallaig, and
a JP in the Lochaber area. He can add accomplished writer to his
curriculum vitae.
Sunset on the Clyde by Duncan Graham is subtitled ''The Last Summers
on the Water''. In 1954 the distinguished educationist became a student
purser on the Prince Edward, the paddle-steamer that plied the length
and breadth of Loch Lomond. ''On good days we left Ardlui astern
perfectly, but at a remarkable rate of knots. On the others, we had
several goes at leaving the pier. On one occasion, owing to a little
misunderstanding over casting off the mooring ropes, we tried to take it
with us.''
A year later a letter ordered him to report to Gourock to serve on MC
Cowal, and there were more hilarious incidents as well as camaraderie.
I enjoyed Sunset on the Clyde enormously. With humour and insight it
seems to me to invoke the last summers of the steamer traffic ''doon the
water'' to the Clyde resorts, on boats with brass fittings and the
rhythmic pulse of paddles and turbines.
While serving on the Jeanie Deans Duncan Graham had a stroke of luck
that would have brought Para Handy to his knees. He and some shipmates
attended the local Conservative and Unionist Party dance.
''Then, as now, the Tories seemed to have been short of funds. I had
hardly entered when I was virtually compelled to buy six raffle tickets,
my protests brushed brusquely aside. Later in the evening . . . there
was a roll of drums and the draw commenced. I won all six major prizes
-- all bottles, all spirits. It transpired that the proceedings had been
rigged but that the selected tickets had fallen into the wrong hands.''
Chust sublime.

DIRT AND DEITY: A Life of Robert Burns.
Ian McIntyre.
HarperCollins, #20
IAN McINTYRE'S book has been serialised in The Herald this week. His
title quotes one Scottish poet (Byron, who found Burns a mass of
contradictions including his combination of ''dirt and deity'') and his
text is motivated by another: Hugh MacDiarmid, who, in A Drunk Man Looks
at the Thistle, damned the old familiar Burns cult and called for a new
look at the creative flame of a famous poet generally regarded as
Scotland's finest: ''Rabbie, wad'st thou were here -- the warld hath
need,/And Scotland mair sae, o' the likes o' thee!''
Many have taken Burns's name in vain but Burns took his name seriously
enough to observe: ''I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripened corn/by
driving winds the crackling flames are borne!''
Burns by nature as well as name, fiery by nature as well as name. He
was always flickering with internal, and arguably infernal, flame which
is why he thought of himself as a poet consumed by nature's fire.
In the cold climate of Scotland, a little cottage generated a fiery
genius: ''There, lanely, by the ingle-cheek,/I sat and ey'd the spewing
reek,/That fill'd, wi' hoast-provoking smeek,/The auld, clay biggin;/And
heard the restless rattons squeak/About the riggin.'' Burns Cottage is
where it all began.
Up to 100,000 visitors a year make a pilgrimage to Alloway to view the
birthplace of Burns and buy tourist trinkets like mugs featuring the
famous poet's famous face. What they see in Burns Cottage is a
whitewashed house preserved as an immaculate shrine to a national
saviour for the life, or legend, of Burns is treated with the reverence
of a religion complete with relics such as, believe it or not and
believers will believe it, the very box-bed in which the ''obscure,
nameless Bard'' -- as he called himself in the calculating preface to
the Kilmarnock Edition -- was born.
Beside Burns Cottage visitors behold a museum making an exhibition of
valuable manuscripts and more relics. Pilgrims to the cottage might be
rich and famous or may be poor folk who feel honestly enriched by the
much publicised ''honest poverty'' of the famous poet. Queen Elizabeth
came to Burns Cottage in July 1956 and visitors can see the pen she used
to sign the visitors' book by way of honouring a poet who had republican
sympathies and proclaimed ''The honest man, though e'er sae poor,/Is
king o'men for a'that'' -- a king of men who revered the House of Stuart
and ridiculed the House of Hanover as ''An idiot race, to honor lost.''
Muhammad Ali, then in the first year of his reign as heavyweight
champion of the world, came to Burns Cottage in August 1965. In the
museum, Ali sat in an oak chair made from the press on which the
Kilmarnock Edition was printed and, suitably inspired, posed a
rhetorical question in a ''poem'' of his own: ''I'd heard of a man named
Burns -- supposed to be a poet;/But, if he was, how come I didn't know
it?/ They told me his work was very, very neat./So I replied: 'But who
did he ever beat?' ''
Burns, Ali acknowledged in a fiery article, was unbeaten in his own
time as Scotland's champion Bard.
Turning, not burning, in his grave Burns also managed to beat his
biographers. Robert Heron, the first biographer of Burns (see A Memoir
of the Life of the Late Robert Burns, 1797), attacked the Bard as a
creative man who destroyed himself by destructively drinking in Dumfries
though the lyrical evidence suggests otherwise.
James Currie, who put together the first collected edition of The
Works (1800), accused Burns of being ''perpetually stimulated by
alcohol'' though the epistolary evidence suggests bout alcoholism, not
non-stop boozing. Later Burnsians attempted to restore the reputation of
Burns by turning him into a religious icon: Robert Chambers (1851)
claimed Burns ''was no lover of drink'' though Burns's greatest poem,
Tam O'Shanter, glorifies a great drunk; Sir James Crichton-Browne
(1925), writing in the Glasgow Herald, declared Burns ''did not die of
drink'' though Burns reckoned ''occasional hard drinking is the devil to
me''; Frankly Bliss Snyder (1932) asserted Burns was ''never a
drunkard'' though Burns admitted he was under the influence.
Richard Hindle Fowler (1988) rejected the romantic view of Burns as a
poor pure soul who succumbed to a sickness of the heart, believing the
Bard contracted brucellosis exacerbated by habitually drinking excessive
quantities of lead-adulterated wine though the poet's widow said Burns
drank ''chiefly rum and gin''.
McIntyre follows on from Fowler which proves nothing apart from the
fact that Fowler is a user-friendly member of one club clubbing good old
Burnsians. All about the Bard is open to interpretation.
Take the matter of Margaret Burns. McIntyre quotes a letter Burns sent
to bookseller Peter Hill in February 1790: ''how is the fate of my poor
Namesake, Mademoiselle Burns, decided? And McIntyre imagines Burns's
query ''related to a young woman called Mathews (who) had come to
Edinburgh the previous year and adopted the name Burns for professional
reasons, the profession in question being the oldest''.
Like most books on Burns, this one avoids the issue of Margaret Burns
by stating she arrived in Edinburgh in 1789 so was, therefore, nowhere
to be seen when the poet first performed in the capital as the city's
favourite poet. On the evidence of his passionate interest in prostitute
Margaret Burns, Rabbie may have satisfied himself in more ways than one
when hanging around in Edinburgh in 1787. Born Margaret Mathews in
Durham, the lady lived in Edinburgh from 1785 and supposedly changed her
surname to Burns to cash in on his celebrity.
Surely the name-change was significant, possibly commemorating a
coming together of the Bawd and the Bard? To appreciate how the Bard's
interest in the Bawd was far from academic we can flash forward to 1789
when she was banished from the city by Burns's parsimonious publisher
William Creech, acting in his capacity as a magistrate. Wrote Burns:
''Cease, ye prudes, your envious railing,/Lovely Burns has charms --
confess;/True it is, she had one failing,/Had ae woman ever less?''
Margaret Burns, with Rabbie's friend Henry Erskine as her counsel,
appealed against Creech's ban and won her case at the Court of Session
in 1789. Burns was apparently unaware of her victory when he wrote to
Hill in 1790: ''Oh Man! but for thee and thy selfish attitudes and
dishonest artifices, that beauteous form, and that once innocent and
still ingenuous mind might have shone conspicuous and lovely in the
faithful wife and the affectionate mother.''
The faithful wife and the affectionate mother: the language is
revealing. Burns must have felt more than lust for his poor namesake.
Eight days after writing the letter to Hill, Burns included a tirade
about tarts in a letter to his brother Bill: ''Whoring is a most ruinous
expensive species of dissipation; is spending a poor fellow's money with
which he ought clothe and support himself nothing? Whoring has 99
chances in 100 to bring on a man the most nauseous and excruciating
diseases to which human nature is liable; are disease and an impaired
constitution trifling considerations? All this is independent of the
criminality of it.''
This preaching pose, however, is at variance with his continuing
passion for Margaret Burns. In 1791 he anticipated her death (in 1792)
in an epitaph ''Fair Burns, for long the talk and toast/Of many a gaudy
Beau/That Beauty has forever lost/That made each bosom glow.'' Burns by
glowing nature as well as name.
Of Burns's song, Scots, Wha Hae, McIntyre simply says it is ''an ode
on liberty and independence'' but it is much more than that. It is a
triumphant defence of radical Scottish lawyer Thomas Muir who was tried
in Edinburgh in 1793 in an egregious example of Scottish injustice.
Accused of sedition -- by exciting disaffection in speeches, circulating
Thomas Paine's Rights of Man, championing the Friends of the People --
Muir conducted his own defence against a formidable opposition. Lord
Braxfield presided over the trial. Robert Dundas, Lord Advocate,
appeared for the Crown.
Every member of the jury of 15 was also a member of an association
which had struck Muir's name off its roll and offered a reward for five
guineas for the discovery of any person circulating Paine's works. In a
speech lasting three hours, Muir described himself as ''a strenuous and
active advocate for an equal representation of the people in the House
of the People''.
Braxfield told the jury Muir had gone ''among ignorant country people,
and among the lower classes of people'' and encouraged political unrest
among ''the rabble''. Only ''the landed interest'', said Braxfield, had
a right to be represented. Muir was sentenced to transportation to
Botany Bay for 14 years.
Burns was on a friendly terms with Friends of the People: Lord Daer,
celebrated in the poem Extempore Verses on Dining with Lord Daer; and
Captain William Johnston, editor of the Edinburgh Gazetteer and a man
the poet advised, in 1792, to ''Lay bare . . . that horrid mass of
corruption called Politics &amp; State-Craft!''
As an exciseman obliged to honour the Crown, Burns was in no position
openly to affirm his faith in radical reform after the sentence on Muir.
Accordingly, Burns got rid of his copies of Paine's Common Sense and
Rights of Man -- and gave them to Dumfries chum George Haugh, a
blacksmith so one of ''the rabble'' despised by Braxfield.
Some suppose Burns wrote Scots Wha Hae in the Murray Arms Hotel,
Gatehouse of Fleet, when he spent a night there on July 31, 1793. Yet
the song, entitled Robert Bruce's march to Bannockburn, first appears in
a letter dated ''about 30 August, 1793'' by Burnsian editor J De Lancey
Fergusson and that date coincides with the Muir trial.
Moreover the letter, to George Thomson, has a significant postscript
explaining how it was composed when ''the accidental recollection of
that glorious struggle for Freedom, associated with the glowing ideas of
some other struggles of the same nature, not quite so ancient, roused my
rhyming Mania''. So Scots Wha Hae uses Bannockburn as a metaphor for the
struggle of the Friends of the People.
Read in this context, Burns's song is urgent propaganda, not simply an
old tale retold: ''Now's the day, and now's the hour,'' he writes. And,
specifically thinking of Muir as a man soon to be taken to London in
irons, Burns exclaims: ''By Oppressions's woes and pains!/By your Sons
in servile chains!/We will drain our dearest veins,/But they shall be
free!''
At his trial, Muir declared: ''Gentleman, from my infancy to this
moment I have devoted myself to the cause of the people. It is a good
cause -- it shall ultimately prevail -- it shall finally triumph.''
Burns supported the sentiment by making Bruce sing a song in praise of
popular freedom fought for in the Scotland of 1793. Had Burns openly
advertised his radical sympathies he might have been treated like Muir.
Significantly, Burns agreed to the Morning Chronicle (May 8, 1794)
publishing his song but insisted: ''let them insert it as a thing they
hae met with by accident, and unknown to me''.
McIntyre's biography, missing important matters relating to Margaret
Burns and Muir, is excellently enthusiastic about the man Burns; but it
is thoughtless in concluding that the poet Burns ''does not, all that
often, make us think''. I think of Burns, as Carlyle did, as the ''most
gifted soul we had in all that century of his''.
As the planet spins towards a new century, I think of Burns as a
thoughtful man, better than any of his many biographers.

IT HAD a very inauspicious beginning, remarkably coherent with its
continuing existence. The Scottish Book Marketing Group was formed
almost by accident after a somewhat quiet and unconfident suggestion.
The scene of its birth was pretty dreary too.
The second Wednesday of February in 1985 was a typically dreich
winter's day, when the rain did not so much as fall but hung loosely
soaking everything in a misty pall. Dunblane Hydro is a massive hotel
which manages to find dark, inhospitable meeting rooms for those
organisations whose wealth does not allow for the full-blown conference
facilities. So it was for the AGM of the Scottish Branch of the
Booksellers' Association.
About 40 hardy souls gathered together to debate the iniquities of
early selling of new titles and to remark upon the burgeoning power of
the new book retailing chains. The small band of Scottish publishers had
also been invited to attend as it was considered a good opportunity for
them to meet their customers en-bloc. As it was, Bill Campbell,
Stephanie Wolfe-Murray and Richard Drew were the only ones brave enough
to face the tautness of such an exhilarating afternoon.
The talk eventually turned to how wonderful the sales of Scottish
titles had been from the indigenous industry that previous Christmas and
how could this momentum be maintained. It was then that the still small
voice dared to suggest a joint organisation. The outcome was the SBMG
which began life with no funds whatsoever but with the brief to launch a
book related week or fortnight later on in 1985. The original committee
comprised the then ubiquitous aforementioned publishers plus the
expertise of booksellers such as Ian Taylor, Pat Innes, and Robert Clow.
This motley crowd did launch the first ever Scottish Book Fortnight in
October 1985 and the central figure was Cliff Hanley who had to parade
around Queen Street and Waverley Stations dressed as a book. Cliff's
answers to the usual ribald comments from the commuting wits should have
been compiled into a dictionary of polite (well, he had to be)
put-downs.
This year sees the tenth annual Scottish Book Fortnight and the fact
that it is happening at all is a remarkable achievement considering how
little money the organisation has. Describing the budget as working on a
shoe-string is far too generous, but by calling in all the favours owed
from one year to the next, funding is squeezed from publishers,
booksellers, and from the press.
The raison d'etre of the fortnight has not altered over the 10 years,
as it has always tried to promote all the Scottish publishers,
regardless of size, equally. It has endeavoured to galvanise booksellers
and librarians into organising author evenings throughout Scotland, and
to advertise all this co-operation in a catalogue.
There is little doubt that the fortnight has helped to raise the
profile of books in Scotland and has helped to boost the sales of some
of the titles mentioned. There is also little doubt that the publishing
emananating from Scottish House has assisted the Scottish book trade
during the past few years and it is essential for all participants in
the local industry that this co-operation is maintained and improved
upon. The new world of cut-price best-sellers will exclude many Scottish
writers from the shelves of Woolworths, Asda, and maybe even from John
Menzies as these stores concentrate purely on books written by the
Jeffrey Archers of this world. Thankfully there is only one of him!
The national promotion allows many of the smaller traders to gain a
mention and a few column inches that they would never normally achieve.
If there is a complaint to be made about Scottish Book Fortnight, then
it is that its format and formula has not altered and there is the
slightest suggestion of stagnation creeping in. It is extremely
difficult to be highly inventive when the resources are threadbare and
most of the hard graft is done part-time and unpaid. Regardless of the
minor carp, the fortnight is one to enjoy, so visit your local bookshop,
library, or community centre, pick up the catalogue and settle down to a
few evenings with an entertainment content slightly different from the
norm.

THE MIDWINTER MUSIC
Edited by Marjory Greig, assisted by Marjorie Wilson
Scottish Cultural Press, #12.95
CELEBRATING Christmas in October seems premature -- but the book trade
must buck seasonal appropriateness to make, as it were, a buck. Hence
the appearance now of The Midwinter Music. The editors of this Scottish
anthology for the festive season would ravel readers in the warmth of
nostalgia and old certainties. How far they succeed may depend on
willingness to suspend disbelief and cynicism and respond to the
conditioned reflexes of childhood.
It's not the hardest of things to do. Harder, indeed, may be the need
to cope with a lot of Scottish dialect, particularly of the northern
variety.
One sometimes harbours a suspicion that the mere use of Scots instead
of English imbues the familiar, or even banal, with significance. Take
the book's opening sequence on the nativity of Christ. Does Marjory
Greig's line from Awa in a Manger -- ''The starns in the dark lift
sklentit doun whar he lay'' -- not somehow seem more poetic than the
''stars in the dark sky'' of the English version? But there is no
difference in concept.
On the other hand, the use of some Scots words may add an
unintentional element of bathos, as in Lilianne Grant Rich's Nativity:
''She gotten a bairn/in the caul howdumdied;'' (can that really be
dialect for dead-of-night?)/''He's there in the strae/Whaur the nowt
(cattle) tak their feed.''
Jamie Stuart tells the nativity story in a prose Scots that sits
easily on the Lowland reader's tongue. And Duncan Williamson melds the
homespun and the biblical engagingly in his tale of the old collie who
witnesses Christ's birth.
Appropriately for its title, The Midwinter Music, includes piano
accompaniments to some of its poems and songs. The paragraphs on Mairi
Macdonald, the Mull crofter's wife who composed that poignant Scottish
carol Child in the Manger, are followed by the spiky tune in its 9/8
time.
Reminiscence, social history, and short fictions all add their
presence to The Midwinter Music as it moves from Christmas to the New
Year (both movable feasts in the old days because of the old calendar).
Choose from Mary MacDonald's memories of Christmas in crofter country in
Morar in the 1930s; David Daiches's outsider's view of Edinburgh
celebrating December 25; Christian Miller's memories of how her English
mother brought warmth to the starkness of winter in an unnamed Scottish
castle. People's capacity for making their own enjoyment in the
pre-TV-zombified age comes across strongly.
Some of the little stories are too sentimental for even this suspended
cynic but you may find J J Bell's Wee Macgregor endearing -- or rather
the adults in his life, particularly his grandfather who tampers with
the clock to allow the sleepy youngster to think he has witnessed the
coming-in of the New Year.
Food looms large in the excerpts. And to complete this clootie
dumpling of a miscellany there are lots of recipes for Scottish fare,
including a concoction called Moonshine -- not whisky but whisked
gelatine with lemons.
A lovely wee book altogether -- and an antidote to all the seasonal
claptrap and commercialised piety that will be let loose as another
nineties Christmas looms.

PART FOUR: EL PASO COUNTY.
John Linklater achieves his long-sought goal.
FROM a ridge on the road north-east from Colorado Springs to Falcon we
could see some antelope down in the valley. Ed Colt senior pointed them
out with a nostalgic grunt. He used to hunt them as a boy on the old Orr
ranch, along with rabbits, grouse, and quail. During the Depression he
could get five 28-gauge shotgun shells for a quarter at the Falcon
store. We were 17 miles out from the city limits, and Ed senior told us
that his grandfather, Judge Orr, used to have a personal stop here on
the Rock Island Railroad branch before it joined the Santa Fe line into
Colorado Springs on the other side of his courthouse.
''They used to stop the Rock Island every morning for the judge and
he'd board it and ride it into town where he held court,'' he recounted.
''And he'd ride it back out to his ranch every afternoon. They made a
special stop just for him. He was a pretty special person.''
After I had made an appointment to meet Ed Colt junior at his
attorney's office he had arranged for me to meet his dad. Despite
himself recently applying for county judge, Ed Colt junior had never
boasted of his background as the great-grandson of Judge Orr to assist
his career, so nobody in the Colorado Springs legal fraternity would
have been able to put me on to him. People were surprised when I said
that I had located Judge Orr's direct descendant in their midst. He was
a modest man, yet proud to make his own way.
We all met up at Ed senior's restaurant, Giuseppe's, one of the
biggest in Colorado Springs, that he had developed in a converted rail
depot after starting out in business with a sandwich bar.
Born in 1927, the year before the judge died, his memories of the
ranch were being taken out there by his grandmother, the judge's widow,
and when things were really tight they all lived out there one summer in
the Depression. But its upkeep had eventually proved too much. The ranch
had been sold by the family, all 6000 acres of it for a mere $90,000,
and access rights had eventually been reneged. A lost birthright.
Ed junior had no memory of ever having been out there before. The
ranch was obviously a sore point with everyone, so I was privileged to
get this rare guided tour.
''It's not every day you meet a lost cousin,'' said Ed senior, with
remarkable generosity. They told me stories about the judge's son, Uncle
Jimmy, who had been a real character, a rebel and a playboy, who had
refused to follow his father into the law, but had started out
goldmining in Cripple Creek after they had tried to straighten him out
with military school in New Mexico. He had worked for the Office of
Price Administration in Washington, for a newspaper in Chicago, gone
into real estate development in San Francisco until he filed a lawsuit
against his partner. In the 1950s he had been racing sports cars, and I
had seen his entries in meetings at Nassau where he had shared the grid
with Stirling Moss and Graham Hill.
He had married five times, been a boozer, a brawler and a hell-raiser
well into his seventies. He had ended up in Santa Fe with his younger
artist wife, Bernique, and she remembered him affectionately when I
spoke to her over the phone. Even when he took for weeks at a time in
his mobile caravan. At 83, when he was dying of cancer, he had said:
''If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care
of myself.'' Everyone loved Uncle Jimmy. They were proud of him. He had
two daughters, one in New Jersey, one in San Francisco.
He had been the last of what I'd discovered as quite a dynasty of
James Alexander Orrs, but I was seven years too late to meet him.
I saw his 1988 grave at the Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs. He
shared it with his teetotaller father, the judge, reconciled at last.
On the road we were approaching the Orr ranch. It had been the Falling
Water Farm, one of the few spreads on this edge of the Great Plains with
ample water from five lakes on the upper pasture, and three on the
lower, for irrigation and raising stock. ''It was a gentleman rancher's
place,'' said Ed senior. ''It wasn't commercial, but he had some stock
and a milk barn. They used to cut ice from one of the lakes, store it
and sell it in the summer. The judge also had a string of racehorses.
Everyone's dead and I can't remember, but he had one that was pretty
famous in the races prior to 1927.''
He stopped the car. ''This fence here was the start of the ranch,'' he
pointed. ''It spread east from here on both sides of the road. This was
his property here that they have developed into a fly-in. You buy your
house in the Meadow Lake development here and own your own hangar as a
garage. You see this barn here? That was the old milk barn that belonged
to the judge. It used to be white. I imagine there are still some holes
on the roof there where I used to go up and shoot pigeons with my .22.
''This was all pasture and if you look down there's water down there.
To the left, there's the railroad grade where they used to stop for him.
They took the tracks out two years ago and sold them. This was the
orchard here. The judge planted all these trees that you're looking at
right here. They were planted for snowbreaks and windbreaks. Here is the
silo right here, and the main barn . . . . the judge built them.
''At the back of those trees was a very grand two-and-a-half storey
ranch-house. I guess some son-of-a-bitch tore it down.''
We drove down a track to the cottage that Judge Orr built in 1920,
apologising to tenants for the intrusion to their weekend afternoon.
They were out with a barbecue and they waved us on up the track, through
a meadow greener and lusher than the rancid doormat of the Prairie I had
come across a week before by Greyhound Bus from Kansas. We drove past
fields with Indian Paint Brushes growing wild like daubs of spreading
rust, past a small lake and on towards the ice house that Uncle Jimmy
had made his first business enterprise as a teenager. It was the first
time Ed senior had been out here for 40 years. ''I could be a cattle
baron right now if I had been left my inheritance,'' he said eventually,
but it had taken some prompting.
There was one final thing we had come out to see. It stretched from
where we were standing for as far as the eye could see, like a
freshly-ironed ribbon tapering only on the flat horizon, after which it
continued east for miles past the boundary of El Paso County. I felt it
was the road I had been travelling, looking for traces, and maybe it
stretched further to link up metaphysically with that old road below
Drumbathie Farm in Airdrie, from where I had set out, and so did the
judge.
This is where my search ended. It was an appropriate spot. We took
photographs below the green road-sign, casting its hard shadow in the
Colorado sun. The sign confirmed what the maps had said, because they
had named this road after him when they built it through his ranch. It
is Judge Orr Road.

PART THREE: COLORADO
John Linklater's search for a distant ancestor took him from Airdrie
to El Paso County. Now, at last, he is able to put a face to the name in
his researches. Here, and on the following two pages, he tells how the
pace of the hunt started to quicken
THE town of Gillett is now just a bend in a Rocky Mountain valley on
Highway 67 heading for Cripple Creek. It would be a ghost if there was
anything left to see. Some rubble in a field remains of what was once a
bank vault, appropriate enough because it was a gold town, and you can
recognise the scar of the former main street only if it is pointed out
to you. But that is about all. It is as dead as Judge Jim Orr, and not a
particularly encouraging starting point for anyone searching for traces
of him in Colorado.
It was one of the mining camps that sprang up quickly after an
old-time prospector, Bob Womack, had the kind of accident that usually
benefits only medical breakthroughs and great scientific discoveries. He
left some local ore by his campfire, and found it bubbling into gold. It
had hardly cooled before Womack had company. Camps became towns, and
there was a competition between two railroads to engineer the first
line. Gillett took its name to honour the president of the winning
company, which was as good a way as any to advertise that enterprise and
investment could bring swift rewards.
If Jim Orr needed to make his fortune quickly in 1895, he had come to
settle in the right place. The smart thing was to let other people do
the digging. There were plenty of less arduous opportunities for a
bright young lawyer. By 1897 the estimate was of $29.2m in gross
production in 400 gold mines around Cripple Creek, Victor, and Gillett.
Colorado Springs suddenly found it had 20 new millionaires among its
populace, and even Denver, 125 miles north, discovered an affluence that
remains unsquandered today.
Jim Orr had no need to get his hands dirty. Mining laws were a little
goldmine in themselves. Seam after seam of legal precedent to exhaust.
Every time a man sank the blade of a pick-axe in the mineral-rich
Rockies he needed a lawyer. And what a rich field of dispute lay up
there in that thin altitude, two miles high and heady, over stakes and
claims and rights.
That attorney Orr had a business brain was clear when Gillett staged
its celebrated bullfight over three days in August, 1895, billed as the
first in the United States. A local hotel owner and gambler, a one-eyed
opportunist called Wolfe, wanted to add a new diversion to the 14
saloons, three dance-halls, a casino, and a race-track that catered for
a population of 3500. Folks had grown tired of the predictability of
watching local prizefighters like future world champion Jack Dempsey,
the Manassa Mauler, knocking the stuffing out of tough miners who
accepted the challenge to all-comers.
What the town needed was a carload of fighting bulls from Mexico, the
man called Wolfe concluded. He brought up a couple of matadors, started
recruiting locally for anyone who could pass as a picador or fit his
banderilleros costumes, and built a 150-foot diameter ring arena in a
wooden stockade. It was to be the first Mexican bullfight in the United
States, with wild west show and fiesta thrown in, rope tricks,
equestrian skills, and La Charitta, ''the only lady bullfighter in the
world''. The only problem was the bulls. The Mexican breed had been
stopped at the border after a campaign led by the Colorado Springs
Humane Society and substituted by others from a local ranch. They
wouldn't fight.
Prodded, poked, cajoled, goaded, and humiliated with darts, they just
slumped dejectedly in the centre of the ring, until Arizona Charlie from
the wild west show blew one of them away with a rifle. In the ensuing
riot, Charlie, matadors, picadors, and El Patron Wolfe were all
arrested, thrown into jail, and fined.
What was Jim Orr's role in this fracas? There is no record of him
representing any of the plaintiffs, but he bought the log pens after the
disastrous bullfight and used the material to build log cabins which he
rented to augment his law-office earnings from his first practice in
Gillett. His wife Cora was running a kind of boarding-house. This was
another detail I uncovered in the research.
You can reach so far in libraries and in the dusty ledgers of
courthouses, turning up microfilm reels and trawling through old
newspaper cuttings. Even given reasonable documentation, my judge proved
surprisingly elusive. After Gillett, he set up an office in Colorado
Springs. I learned that he paid some employees in mineral rights, so it
can be assumed that this was one of the currencies he worked in, earning
fees in percentages of stakes, investing a share in clients' future
claims in return for professional services. He probably had some
holdings of his own. I came across an intriguing reference in one of the
papers to a gold strike near the town of Midland by a man called Harry
Weiman, ''working for Jim Orr''.
Research can give the illusion of contact as you trace your man
through the Colorado Springs directories from 1896 onwards, noting his
change of residence from 520 South Moreno Avenue to 530 South Prospect
to 2115 North Cascade Avenue, the phone number Red 561, the changing
address of his office from the Giddings Building to the Exchange Bank
Building to the Mining Exchange Building, and the different partnerships
he formed over the years, always getting his name in first -- Orr &amp;
McKesson, Orr &amp; Cunningham, Orr, Robinett and Mason, Orr &amp; Little and
finally Orr &amp; McGarry. Dry stuff, but to the researcher, each additional
little nugget acquires a disproportionial excitement and satisfaction.
Yes, he was here all right.
Then there were the disappointments. His front-page obituary in the
Colorado Springs Gazette of January 3, 1928, confirmed his election to
the bench of the County Court in 1902, and also described him as ''one
of the pioneers at bar in the region'', handling ''many celebrated
cases''. So, what were these celebrated cases? I couldn't find out. At
the County Court they couldn't tell me anything. They ran a computer
check of the database that produced nothing, and handed me a bill. In
the records section down in the basement we were able to pull his will,
but they couldn't help me further unless I could cite cases. Catch 22.
They weren't trying to be unhelpful. The American legal profession is
notoriously neglectful of its own history. Watching the interminable O J
Simpson trial, you'd be tempted to say this is because the American
legal profession is entirely self-preoccupied.
But a records clerk in the basement called Sherry repeated the name
Judge Orr as though it was familiar. ''You've heard of him?'' I queried.
''Uh, no,'' she said. ''I just remember his photograph in the Bar
Association library.'' She took me over to see it. There were several
rows of judges along the wall. He was top left. For the first time I
could see what the man I had been tracking looked like.
It was a strong face, square with a jaw nearly as wide as his
forehead, a slab of bent nose, pale eyes that you could read as
twinkling but that was up to you, and a heavy mouth that had muscled his
face just working itself open and shut, a function you sensed it would
be reluctant to perform unless there was anything that needed to be
said. He looked too classically tough to resemble anyone in my family.
Give him a fedora and he could have been a boxing promoter, or Mafia, or
both.
The surprise was how young he appeared. In his courtroom he looked
even younger. What the library lacked in documentary record on Judge Orr
they compensated in visual material, because there on another wall was a
photograph of a jury, counsel, and court officials, convened and posing
for the camera. There was no mistaking the man on the bench, in a suit
and tie, dark hair freshly barbered, gazing steadily ahead to the public
gallery. If the 1903 dating of the photograph was accurate, this was Jim
Orr at age 40 in his second year of office.
The only thing missing from the photograph was a defendant. The
historical interest for the Bar Association was that this had been the
first jury assembled in the newly opened courthouse, and within that
jury was the county's first black juror. He was identified as William
Seymour, born a slave in Kentucky and as a free man in Colorado he had
gone on to gain landholdings and a dairy. His prominent positioning
among the hand-picked jury of worthy citizens in the photograph made it
clear that Colorado Springs was keen to display its egalitarianism.
Perhaps that also applied to the Airdrie-born judge on the bench.
But he was no hanging judge. The nearest I could connect him to a
murder case was 30 years after his death when there had been a shooting
in the courthouse office he had formerly used. A janitor pumped five
bullets into the chief custodian in an argument over wages. The guilty
man got eight years' hard labour, which suggested you had to do a lot of
killing for much hanging in Colorado.
The painful truth, and I had come an awful long way to discover it,
was that the jurisdiction of a county court in the 1900s Colorado was
not very exciting. It was a total bore. The staff at the Penrose Library
in Colorado Springs, who had been absolute sweethearts in helping me
find material, were almost apologetic when they turned up the document I
needed. Translated, it defined the job of county judges as dealing with
misdemeanours, rigged elections, wills, and cheap divorces. ''When the
amount involved does not exceed 2000 dollars,'' was the deflating
phrase. Worse, county court judges were elected for a term of only three
years. ''Maybe you could just lie,'' suggested one of the Penrose
librarians.
Until the gold-mines went bust around 1914, Colorado Springs was
heaving with lawyers, and the legal profession was heaving with judges.
You kept the title after your few years of office. It looked good on the
office door when you went back into practice. At least two of Jim Orr's
legal partners were former judges, and there were eight judges as
pall-bearers at his funeral in 1928.
You couldn't swing a coffin without knocking over a couple of judges.
And they had judges who weren't judges, like the celebrated Judge
Baldwin, adventurer, vigorous Democrat, survivor of two Arapahoe
woundings and a scalping, who was never seen sober and drowned in a
shallow well at the age of 46. He got his honorary title judging sheep
at the Colorado Territory fair.
''Judge Orr would be doing petty crimes, prostitution, vagrancy, that
kind of thing,'' legal historian and attorney Scott Briggs suggested,
which was a remark that could be taken the wrong way, but at least he
didn't mean committing petty crimes, just sentencing people for them.
''Old Colorado City was a city of sin in those days, so he would have a
pretty active criminal docket. He would be giving out one-way tickets to
Kansas and sending drunks to the asylum for a cure. That's the way the
courts worked in those days.
''He made his fortune up in Cripple Creek and he could buy land down
here when it was relatively cheap. Then he moved downtown on the old
north end where if you had made it, that's where you built your house.
He would have gone on the deal with clients to get a piece of the
action. This was legitimate. If you struck it big you shared in the
success. So you were doing legal services for free, like contingent fees
on personal injuries today. That was the risk you took. The wise and
astute lawyers, and those of good fortune, made a lot of money.''
So, he had become a society lawyer. The term as judge was an ornament
to his rising career, rather than its object. That he had moved from the
rowdy gold camps to an office in the Mining Exchange Building was
altogether significant, and in a young town like Colorado Springs, the
Little London of the Rockies, it was easy to climb towards
respectability, if you had money.
In the library I found old maps that showed he possessed a big spread
of land north-east of town, around the village of Falcon in El Paso
County. My plans to get out there received an unexpected boost. I found
a guide, a man who knew the old Orr property well. He had spent some of
his boyhood there.
The connection was made through a long-shot telephone call. The
obituaries had told me that the judge had two daughters and a son, the
third James Alexander Orr. Colorado was different from Kansas and
Missouri, in that there were absolutely no Orrs to be found in the
telephone books. The judge's will had given me the married names of his
daughters: Bradman and Colt. There was an intriguing coincidence. An
Edward S Colt, attorney, was listed at 620 South Cascade Avenue,
Colorado Springs. The address was close to one of the judge's former
residences. What made it worth a try was the attorney connection, and
the fact that the man Hazel V Orr married was also Edward S Colt.
''Hazel Orr?'' Edward S Colt asked when I got through from a pay-phone
in the Penrose Library. ''Well, she was my grandmother.''

Galsgow's McLellan Galleries has played host to creative spirits of
varying hues, but rarely have its august portals seen such a candid
expression of the artistic spirit as in an exhibition opening next
month. Ruth Wishart meets the photographer who persuaded a distinguished
company to bare thier souls
IT'S TRUE. I have discovered the twin secrets of eternal youth and
successful dieting. This is the good and exciting news. The enthusiasm
is ever so slightly tempered by the fact that it apparently applies only
to gentlemen of a certain age who are also accomplished artists.
How else to explain the self-portraits of Alexander Goudie which will
adorn this year's Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts which opens
in the McLellan Galleries in a week's time? For there he is, a
positively splendid figure of a man clad in one likeness only in a
pre-Pampers loin-cloth, and in a second in nothing but the
well-proportioned, suitably be-muscled scud.
But if you should venture to another part of the gallery you will find
yet another likeness of the celebrated Scottish artist, captured this
time by photographer Eric Thorburn whose portraits of all the living
members of the RGI, some 45 artists in all, are cleverly assembled in
various poses in their places of work or residence. And here we have
Goudie pictured in the aforementioned loin cladding arrangement before
the easel on which sits his own self-portrait. And do you know, the very
business of sitting for himself seems to have taken positively years off
him, not even to mention him losing a few stray pounds as he leapt from
floor to canvas.
Thorburn forbears to comment on the contrast caught by his talented
lens.
Thorburn, throughout a convivial luncheon, forbears to make any
remotely unflattering comment at all, which is one of the reasons he
remains in much-sought-after business.
He does, however, shed some entertaining light on the task he set
himself; to celebrate the exhibition by introducing us all to the
personnel behind some of Scotland's most sought-after paintings. There
is David Donaldson, a year off 80, beaming cherubically from the
all-enveloping folds of a hooded dressing-gown which he apparently
purchased for the occasion. Donaldson is also to be seen painting in
this garment, a folly not encouraged, one suspects, by the person
charged with his laundry arrangements.
There is the serene Bet Low, lounging in typically understated style,
against a splendid example of Mackintosh stained glass; and the wondrous
Mary Armour, a sprightly 93[1/2], grinning with infectious pleasure at a
posy of flowers. All the RGIs were advised that they would be shot in
both black and white and colour. Armour was having none of it. God gave
us eyes to see in colour, she admonished Thorburn. I don't want to be a
black and white person. And so, uniquely in this collection, she isn't.
Other senior members of this most distinguished company are wearing
equally well: William Crosbie, splendidly turned out in a rakish beret,
George Wylie peering jocularly through one of his many metallic homages
to ornithology.
Husband and wife team John Houston and Elizabeth Blackadder were
photographed entirely separately, reports Thorburn, each in their own
preferred workplace.
That particular duo posed without preamble, as did many of the
subjects from the far and north east. The occidental contigent, it
seems, were more inclined to offer tea ceremonies to establish some kind
of pre-photographic rapport. Willie Rodger included Thorburn and wife
and colleague Liz in the family meal, while John Cunningham, learning
that his was the last portrait needed to complete the matched set,
offered liquid pleasures of a rather more lethal nature.
Some artists, to Thorburn's mild irritation, displayed
uncharacteristic housepride and tried to tidy up their studios before
his arrival. Happily Glen Scoullar and Barbara Rae among others were
content to be captured in typical clutter. Duncan Shanks, typically
reticent, was reluctant to let Thorburn into the workplace at all,
though it was full of the most wonderful colour, he reports. Many got a
serious attack of artist's block at the very notion of painting on while
the photographer also worked but there are fascinating insights none the
less into the creative process.
George Devlin, for instance, proving as cheery a chappie at work as he
is at play; Norman Edgar having the confidence to be captured doing what
comes naturally, relaxing with a glass of something soothing. Archie
McIntosh pictured three days before his wedding, proudly standing beside
the work of his late first wife. Jack Knox at his cottage in Arran, a
guest at the McIntosh nuptials, able to give Thorburn an action replay a
week later.
It was, says Thorburn, the kind of task which initially sounded
daunting but which proved so much fun that he could have started all
over again.
One of the bonuses of Thorburn's suggestion that his exhibition
feature all of the RGIs is that this year all of them also promised to
submit work to the main exhibition. Which means a much better than usual
influx from Edinburgh RGIs with not just the work of Houston and
Blackadder featured, but David Michie, Charles McQueen, and sculptor
Vincent Butler in addition to RSA president William Baillie who will
also speak at the RGI's annual dinner.
They are all, of course, very familiar with each other's work. But the
prize for the artist most often featured in his colleagues' homes goes
to Willie Rodger whose witty woodcuts are part of the furniture in such
diverse settings at Christine McArthur's Glasgow West End flat and
William Crosbie's rather stately Hampshire pile.
I have to confess a wee penchant for Mr Rodger's work myself. But, as
you might expect, his ''wee hangover'' was purchased on the grounds of
artistic merit rather than personal identification.
Eric Thorburn's Artists in Residence will run in tandem with the
annual exhibition of the RGI at the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow from
November 5 to December 3.

DENZEL Washington is the front-runner as America's black film-makers
move on from their turf, from the Hood. It is going to be an interesting
few months to see how audiences rate the new mood.
For Carl Franklin, director of Devil in a Blue Dress -- a film that
has hints of Chinatown and the best of Chandler -- and for Washington,
convincing that anything other than a ''black'' movie would pay at the
box office was the first of many tests. The supposed novelty of films
showing blacks blasting each other to bits over crack deals in urban
jungles has, understandably, become pedestrian on film. Black artists
don't so much want to join the mainstream but to create their own
mainstream highway.
Punctuating all this will be Spike Lee's must-see Clockers which is
the film version of Richard Price's brilliant novel. Harvey Keitel,
natch, is the white cop intent on arrest in a book/film which is black
ghetto and drugs. But Lee says this is that and vice versa: ''It was our
intention for this to be the final nail in the coffin of the 'black'
movie. It's dead. It's over. Move on! This genre is at its end now.
''It's up to Afro-American film-makers to open our vision. If you
don't expand and grow, you'll die.''
His pragmatic view is reflected by his next two films which have the
tabloid mix of sex and sport. Girl 6 is about a Hollywood actress who is
making ends meet, as it were, in the telephone sex business. The Jackie
Robinson Story speaks for itself about the life of the first black
baseball star.
Spike Lee is a proven player. And something like Clockers is a
certified cheque. But, as in roulette, the winners are not secured.
The present spin on the wheel includes White Man's Burden, ''a
dramatic fantasy'' which involves John Travolta and Harry Belafonte in
an America where blacks are the majority. It opens in America just
before Christmas. Due out then too is Waiting to Exhale which is about
four middle-class black women. This month Dead Presidents, the story of
Marines in Vietnam who then return to South Bronx, was presented to
America. The advertising posters show four men around a table piled high
with dollars and the slogan: ''The Only Colour That Counts is Green.''
Dead Presidents was produced by 22-year-old fraternal twins Albert and
Allen Hughes. Three years ago they made the critically praised Menace II
Society which, like Boyz N the Hood, would be pigeon-holed a ''black''
movie. Stacy Snider of Tri-Star Studios which made Devil in a Blue Dress
said: ''The challenge is to grab the white audience and say: 'Hey, this
is different, this is a great story, this does not just appeal to a
niche audience'.''
Samuel L Jackson, who created a sensation opposite Travolta in Pulp
Fiction, had an even bigger hit this year co-starring with Bruce Willis
in Die Hard with a Vengeance. Willis' Detective John McClane is seen
wandering through Harlem wearing a sandwich board reading: ''I hate
niggers.'' It caused heat in so politically-correct America. Willis
thought: ''The topic of racism I think needs to be talked about, needs
to be shown.''
Jackson wasn't bothered by the scene: ''The point is we live in a
society based a lot on race -- and some racial preconceptions.
''Now, with this new attitude to 'black' films I would assume studios
are accepting the fact that there's a greater diversity to our lives
than kids in the Hood, than the drugs and violence stories.''
The growing group of aspiring black movie-makers are pressing on.
Darnell Martin is about to start production of Listening to the Dead, a
psychological horror film about a racially mixed family. Leslie Harris
is doing Royalties, Rhythm and Blues, a thriller about a black female
executive in the record business. Harris admitted: ''The problem is
money and many executives you talk to still expect you to do hood
movies.''
Four years ago John Singleton's Boyz N the Hood won acclaim for its
intelligent focus on life in south-Central Los Angeles. The film cost
$6m and earned $56m.
Such dollar equations sparked a string of similar films like Jason's
Lyric, Sugar Hill and Above the Rim. They were inexpensive to make and
profitable. In America, black teenagers are the most regular
cinemagoers.
Forrest Whitaker, who directed Waiting To Exhale, has no illusions:
''With black films everything becomes a test case.''

Private baths clubs created a splash in the Victorian age. Clare
Trodden dons a little black bikini to discover how their faded elegance
survives today.
DON'T let anyone tell you that Victorian values are no good. Take that
cleanliness/godliness fetish, it wasn't all bad. It lent a cloak of
respectability to certain aquatic pleasures, allowing well-heeled
Victorians to burst out of their corsets and collars and dive into a
more free and easy style at their private baths club.
The private clubs inspired local corporations to provide public baths
for the masses -- exercise and cleanliness at a stroke -- but these were
never in the same luxurious league as the prototypes. Glasgow's
Arlington Baths, built in 1870, are Britain's oldest swimming baths. The
facade itself harks back to better days, when its architecture was
shamelessly copied by one of London's first baths clubs. Now it looks
like a rather grand old dame -- more refined than the Barbara Cartland
model but with the same air of faded glory and a bit too much powder
caked in the crevasses.
A brave facade barely admits the surrounding environmental chaos.
Dust-diggers and double parking are the least of it. The Woodlands baths
are now hemmed in by new buildings, mere whipper-snappers to this
125-year-old -- but these are looked upon with a kindlier eye than you
might imagine.
They herald the regeneration of an area which has suffered too much
dereliction and demolition. The baths' own #1m ongoing facelift not only
complements these renovations but should also see their own standing
upgraded from a B to an A Listed building by Historic Scotland.
Modern technology has advanced right up to the portals; admission is
now by electronic entry card. Once inside, though, things are much
different. Baths Master Jim Brannan will most likely greet you by name
as you pick up your towels and freshly laundered swimming costume.
This is not your standard splash-and-grab modern leisure centre. Here
there's no place for Muzak just as there is no place for a slipper room.
This is neither a restful haven nor a spanking new correction centre.
It's full of flip-flops and trainers unacquainted with Odour Eaters.
It's a place to shake off the dust and change from outdoor shoes before
entering the inner sanctum.
The place reeks of tradition, but outside the slipper room it has a
much sweeter smell. In the lavishly tiled Turkish suite wooden
deckchairs of the ocean-liner, not back-garden, variety fan out under an
ornate dome. Light from the coloured -- red, white and blue, of course
-- cut-outs in the dome plays around the room, but very little else
moves much in here. Outside in the pool, you can't ignore the thought of
strenuous activity. Particularly with rings and trapeze dangling above
the pool.
How long since some young thing did a tarzan over this pool? Is it
still allowed? Is it even possible?
Robin Ray replies with two lengths over the pool -- he is fully
clothed and didn't even get his feet wet. Coy about his age, Robin
admits to a 30-year membership at Arlington, interrupted by several
years of commitments elsewhere which indicates that he may well be the
oldest swinger in this town.
Usually his amazing trapeze feat is achieved in his swimming costume,
for regulars. ''Most people don't mind it, but there are some who won't
move from the ring lane -- mostly young men,'' he explained. They're
probably the sort who've instigated 7am opening to get in a good 50
lengths before work. Much more in keeping with the mid-morning
atmosphere are the pair doing a passable impression of Mapp and Lucia
scrutinising each other and the affairs of the day as they ease up and
down the pool.
They can do so with impunity, knowing that no hairy beast will cut
them up in the water. Segregation is practised here.
Each sex has alloted times for exclusive use of most facilities --
though there is a happy union at other times, notably at weekends when
families are welcomed, even encouraged by the recent addition of
poolside family cubicles.
The separation of the sexes has a liberating effect on the
skinny-dipping pensioners in the shower-room and those soothing their
bones of a certain age in the steam-room. They all shower the place with
affection -- ''It makes me feel young again all this delightful
freedom''.
Facing such a liberated pensioner can make you feel overdressed and
give a previously unimagined modesty to a little black bikini. It'll
also make you think again about the passions seething just beneath the
surface of those Gannex-coated exteriors in tearooms all over Glasgow.
There's a price to pay for such confidences.
There's also a price to pay for the privilege of membership. This
averages out at #300 annually per adult. It's not cheap and members
should make the most of it. ''I would tell people it's not worth their
while if they'll only come in once a week,'' says Jim Brannan.''We don't
want anyone feeling they've paid over the odds. It's all-inclusive so if
you come two or three times a week then it's worth it.
''We have a nice relaxed atmosphere here and people respond to that.''
Some people are more responsive than others. Brannan drops in a few
names -- Nureyev, Big Country, and the Taggart team -- who've enjoyed
the Arlington atmosphere. One name he refuses to drop is of the member
who was exhausted and highly emotional after sealing a #1m deal. He was
taken in, put to bed, dried out, rehydrated, and eventually set loose on
the world in a more civilised state. Fit to be seen and not a soul heard
of his indiscretion. The Victorians would approve.

As the only black actor in America's A-list, Denzel Washington is
coining in his share of the tinseltown riches. But, as he tells Phil
Penfold, what he really wants to do is make an action movie for his son.
A THOUGHT occurs to Denzel Washington. ''What I find interesting,'' he
says slowly, ''is that almost every time I've been nominated for an
Academy Award, I was up against people who were either 20 years older
than I am -- or the British. I don't think we take acting as seriously
as we should do in America.''
Denzel, now 40, is set to clean up once again this autumn in not one
but two major movies. Crimson Tide has him co-starring with Gene Hackman
in a suspense thriller on board a nuclear submarine, and Devil in a Blue
Dress pairs him with Jennifer Beals.
Washington is one of the very few bankable black stars in Hollywood,
and probably the only one in the very first rank of his profession.
''All the actors I consider to be greats -- Gene Hackman, Dustin
Hoffman, Al Pacino, De Niro, Meryl Streep, Anthony Hopkins, they're all
from the theatre. And the younger ones I consider great, Ralph Fiennes,
Daniel Day-Lewis and Kenneth Branagh -- are all British, and they're all
theatre too. An actor learns to act on stage. Actors can't learn to act
in movies because making a film offers limitless second chances to get
things right. Not so with the theatre.
''Having said that, I'm in no rush to get back to live performance at
the moment. I can't do it anymore, I get bored, it's too mechanical.''
He's talking now about what he says he doesn't really like discussing,
his job.
An oscar winner (for Best Supporting Actor in Glory) Washington is
wearing a dark T-shirt underneath a classy wool cardigan and a pair of
black slacks. Talking about Crimson Tide, he slowly tautens his frame so
that, at the end of describing one scene, he is sitting bolt upright,
ramrod straight.
He plays a cool and honourable executive officer seconded to Hackman's
boat. And, in this Hunt for Red October meets The Caine Mutiny drama,
his character mutinies when Hackman's Captain refuses to call off a
potentially catastrophic missile attack, despite the fact that the order
to launch it was garbled and incomplete.
The role requires Denzel to go from loyal deputy to man-in-charge in
one key scene, and as he explains it through, you can see his biceps
starting to knot.
''The stage is the only crucible for talent,'' he claims. But among
African Americans with that background, he admits that he is one of very
few performers to make the transition to big-grossing mainstream movies
like Philadelphia and The Pelican Brief. Ones that play in the States to
the core audiences of the urban film-goers and the mostly white suburban
multiplex audiences.
He has had some memorable moments in his better films. The recoil of
disgust when, as the homophobic lawyer, a young gay man made a pass at
him in Philadelphia, that single but proud tear of defiance in defeat in
Glory, and the furious but razor-sharp anger in Malcolm X when he speaks
from the lectern.
''I don't know if it was because of Philadelphia or The Pelican Brief,
or both,'' he says, ''but I can see a difference in my career because of
both those films. There's a lot of people who -- let's admit it -- would
never go to see Malcolm X or Cry Freedom or Soldier's Story, but they
will go to see Julia Roberts or Tom Hanks. And in doing that, they'll
also see me and I hope they say 'well, he's quite good too', and then
all of a sudden, you're there.
''Tom Cruise is another example. His image as a serious actor went up
considerably after he appeared with Paul Newman in The Color of Money
and with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Those were smart moves. Put
yourself up there with some really top guys, so that you don't have to
pull the boat by yourself. That's what I've done with Crimson Tide and,
in a sense, with some of the other films.
''Actually, I think it was more of a gamble on Philadelphia because
Tom hadn't done that type of film. He has great broad base appeal, but
could he pull that one off?
''With Julia in Pelican Brief, you had a huge hit book and an actress
that hadn't done a movie for two years, and everybody was waiting. But
that was a little scary because if it had failed, would they have said
it failed because of me?
''It didn't fail. But when I Love Trouble -- with Julia and Nick Nolte
didn't do too well I went: 'Hey, all right then, all you non-believers.'
And I'm not knocking other people.''
His next movie, Virtuosity is a virtual-reality action picture
directed by Brett Leonard, who was the guy behind Lawnmower Man. I put
it to him that this is hardly, well, ''serious'' stuff in keeping with
his career strategy, surely?
Totally deadpan, Denzel says: ''My decision to do the film had far
more to do with my son wanting me to do an action movie. I'm serious.
And I hadn't done one in a while.
''But I did, I admit, say that after the first one, Ricochet, I'd
never ever do one again. And now that I've done it again, I'll say it
again!'' And he laughs.
''I don't like them. You've got to run and jump and leap about all
over the place. You don't talk. It's not acting.''
At the moment, the intensely private and protective Washington is
''coming to terms with the whole movie-star thing. It has its benefits
and also its baggage. I'm sort of in denial about all of it. I like to
think of myself as just a regular sort of guy, ordinary Joe, just
chopping wood. I didn't get into this business to be a movie star.''
Which is why, he admits, he and his wife Pauletta Pearson and their
children took time off this summer to travel all over North Africa and
Spain. As soon as Virtuosity wrapped, they locked up their home in
Tolucca Lake and headed East.
He started off at the San Francisco Conservatory Theatre (after
studying at Fordham University) and then moved to New York to work for
the prestigious theatre company headed by Joseph Papp. He won the Obie
Award for A Soldier's Play, and repeated the role for Norman Jewison
when he made the movie, A Soldier's Story. And that in turn helped him
land the role of Dr Philip Chandler in St Elsewhere.
Now Denzel is thinking of working again, although he says that most of
the projects he has in mind ''are in the chatting stage at the moment''.
But he is set to star opposite Whitney Houston in The Bishop' Wife,
and will rejoin Ed Zwick (who directed him in Glory) for Courage Under
Fire, a story about a military investigator looking into the death of a
female Gulf War soldier. Yes, he says, a remake of A Star Is Born, also
with Houston, is a ''possibility'', and yes Spike Lee also wants him on
board in another movie. It must surely be highly gratifying to be in
such high-profile constant demand. Washington shrugs a world-weary shrug
and says: ''I don't even want to think about them. Sure, I'm gonna have
to. But I don't want to!''

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton's historic visit north of the border
to Londonderry was declared a personal triumph last night.
The Dublin premier walked the streets of the Catholic Bogside and
Creggan and met parents and children at a school in the Protestant
Fountain district, on a visit which organisers said broke new ground in
the Irish peace process.
Apart from a brief protest by loyalist councillors who also boycotted
a special Guildhall reception, his visit went off without incident.
Mr Bruton also talked to church leaders, leading businessmen, and
community representatives. SDLP leader John Hume, who accompanied him
throughout, said: ''Who would have dreamt of such a visit a year ago?''
Scores of people stepped forward to shake Mr Bruton's hand as he made
his way through the city centre into the Fountain and out towards the
Bogside and Creggan.
In the Fountain, he spoke of his hopes of a bright new future for the
two traditions and at one stage, parents, children, and staff applauded
him.
This was the first time a Prime Minister from the republic has visited
such a fiercely loyalist part of the province and he was clearly
overwhelmed by the reception.
Just before leaving the Irish premier said: ''I think this is a
tremendous breakthrough that a Taoiseach could be received this way by
people who are loyal to the union and who have their own political
opinions which haven't changed.
''The difficulties are there and are real enough but they are there
only as an expression of mistrust and if you can overcome the mistrust
as is clearly happening after what we saw today, all those other
problems about arms and who talks to whom can recede quite easily once
the trust is built on the ground.''
However, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said Republicans are refusing
to hand over their weapons because they still feel under threat of
attack.
''Fear of attack by loyalist or British forces is real,'' he said in
an article in the Belfast Telegraph. It has been part of life within a
sectarian state whose government and allies have never baulked at using
the gun.''
The Sinn Fein leader claimed his party's aim was still to see the gun
taken out of Irish politics. He wanted a process of total
demilitarisation including the disarmament of all armed groups and their
disbandment.
Security Minister Sir John Wheeler, however, said the Government was
sticking to its demand for decommissioning to begin. ''That's the
important word, a start of the process,'' he said. Speaking on BBC
Radio, Sir John said what will bring all the constitutional parties to
talk in the same room is the certainty and confidence in their minds
that the Provisional IRA have got rid of, or are in the process of
getting rid of, their arsenal.
The DUP leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, and his deputy Peter Robinson
have told the Clinton administration to adopt a ''politically neutral
role'' if they want the presidential visit to Northern Ireland next
month to be a success.
They were speaking after the 45-minute long talks in Washington with
Vice-President Al Gore. A statement issued later by the loyalist
politicians said it had been ''an affable and courteous meeting which we
found to be worthwhile''.
Meanwhile, in Belfast, Mr Tommy Kirkham, chairman of the Ulster
Democratic Party which represents the UDA, said the current stalemate in
the peace process was ''undermining loyalist confidence in desire or
ability of republicans to move towards a realistic settlement''.

A TOUGH stance on homework from Labour was endorsed yesterday by the
party's new spokeswoman on Scottish education, Mrs Helen Liddell.
However, the main teachers' union criticised the proposals put forward
by Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett, who said a Labour
Government would encourage schools and parents to collaborate on
ensuring that children aged seven and above did at least half an hour of
homework a night, rising to a daily minimum of 90 minutes for secondary
pupils.
EIS deputy general secretary Fred Forrester said last night: ''Once
again, we will have to disagree with Mr Blunkett and even with Mrs
Liddell.''
However, Mrs Liddell said she was ''very attracted'' by Mr Blunkett's
proposals, not least because she was a parent with one child at primary
and another at secondary school.
The EIS argues that individual teachers should have the right to
decide whether and how much homework should be given.
Mr Blunkett told a local government conference in Yorkshire that,
under Labour, homework would be a key to raising academic standards and
economic competitiveness.

SCOTTISH Environment Minister Lord Lindsay yesterday called on
Opposition MPs to stop ''scaremongering'' over wartime munitions
resurfacing on Scottish shores and allow the experts to get on with
their investigations.
He was speaking during a visit to Ayrshire to meet personnel involved
in the clean-up operation after almost 4000 objects were washed up in
recent weeks.
Lord Lindsay met senior police officers, coastguard officials, and
members of the Royal Navy ordnance team which disposed of the
phosphorous sticks washed up on the coasts of Ayrshire and Argyll.
Lord Lindsay said he regretted that Opposition MPs, such as Mr George
Foulkes had been ''spouting off'' in recent weeks as the situation has
developed and asked them to allow the work to continue and for the
results to be collated and analysed.
The Minister was accompanied to the shore at Stevenston by Cunninghame
North MP Brian Wilson, who said: ''I welcome the surveys but still feel
that the work being done by Premier Transco for British Gas in the area
should be suspended until it is established beyond doubt where these
objects are coming from and if the work has disturbed them.''

A PROPOSAL to build the UK's first funicular mountain railway in the
Cairngorms received a setback yesterday when the Cairngorms Partnership
board conceded that outstanding issues needed to be resolved before it
could support the project.
Objectors had called for alternative schemes which would cause less
environmental damage.
The funicular is part of a proposed #15m development of the Cairngorm
ski centre by Cairngorm Chairlift Company. A planning application is
currently lodged with Highland Regional Council but has been delayed
because of an objection by Scottish Natural Heritage.
According to the company's proposals, the funicular would carry about
1200 skiers an hour to within 500ft of the summit and would approach the
top station underground via a 250- metre tunnel.
A board spokesman said alternative schemes had not been discussed. He
said the board had sent a letter to Mr Richard Cameron, the region's
director of planning, stating that it would be ''imprudent'' for matters
to be taken forward until a number of issues were ''unequivocally and
satisfactorily resolved''.
Foremost amongst these was the necessity of ''meeting the requirements
of the situation, in a lasting way, that is acceptable to all those
involved''.
The Cairngorms Partnership set up by the Scottish Office last spring
to resolve the conflict between conservation and development in the
area, now intends to convene a consortium of its members, to agree to
commission a study of the Aviemore, Glenmore, Cairngorm, and
neighbouring areas.
The Ramblers' Association, one of the opponents of the funicular,
welcomed the board's recognition that a number of issues still had to be
considered and plans for the commission of a study.

<TEXT>
THE deadline for bids to run the first three privatised rail lines
passed yesterday with Labour condemning the landmark as ''another point
in the Government's campaign of vandalism against Britain's rail
services''.
Bids had to be in by 3pm yesterday if private companies wanted to
operate the Great Western, South West, and LTS Rail (London Tilbury and
Southend) routes.
Bidders, who include British Rail management buy-out teams, bus
companies, and shipping company Sea Containers, will now be evaluated by
Franchise Director Roger Salmon.
He is expected to announce the winners of the franchises by the end of
the year.
''Rail privatisation is the proof that the Tories have let dogma
overtake commonsense,'' said Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short.
She added: ''Already, season ticket holders on the LTS line have lost
the right to travel into Liverpool Street and the Government is claiming
the use of second-hand trains on LTS -- rejected for use on the West
Anglia lines -- is a great service improvement.''
Ms Short also said Sea Containers had threatened commuter services on
South West. She warned anyone thinking of buying the franchises that
Labour had made it clear it would not renew any franchises let by the
Tories at the end of the seven-year contracts.
''There will be no fat profits while services decline. The gravy train
will hit the buffers the minute Tony Blair enters Downing Street.''

PRISONS watchdog Judge Stephen Tumim yesterday re-ignited the
controversy over the future of prisons, warning that the Learmont report
had opened ''the road to the concentration camp'' by placing security
above humanity.
The remarks by the outgoing Chief Inspector of Prisons, who also
called for a national policy to fight hard drug abuse in jails,
immediately sparked a political row.
Judge Tumim, who steps down next week after eight years in the job,
accused Sir John Learmont of getting the balance wrong between security
and humanity in his damning report into last January's breakout from
Parkhurst prison.
The judge said: ''He wants to put security above humanity. I find that
something wholly unacceptable. It's the road to the concentration camp
if you go too far along it and it's quite wrong. It's morally wrong.
''On that issue, I'm entirely against Sir John Learmont and I hope
Ministers will not follow the path he is offering.
''If you put security above humanity, what happens if a man tries to
climb a wall? On the Learmont doctrine, what do you do, shoot him?
''It's a very dangerous doctrine to promulgate, putting security
automatically above the other factors of humanity,'' Judge Tumim said.
However, Mr Michael Stephen, vice-chairman of the Conservative
back-bench home affairs committee, was quick to criticise Judge Tumim's
strong language, accusing him of putting the interests of the criminal
first.
''There's absolutely nothing in Sir John's report which would lead to
the conclusion that we're setting up concentration camps or there's any
plan to shoot prisoners.
''For the last 30 years, people like Judge Tumim have put the
interests of the criminal first.''
Labour home affairs spokesman Alun Michael said: ''The problem is that
the balance for the Prison Service is being distorted by Home Secretary
Michael Howard's imperatives -- his own survival -- and the incompetence
with which he has approached these things.''
Following publication earlier this month of Sir John's report, Mr
Howard sacked the Prison Service director general Derek Lewis,
unleashing a furious row over the division of responsibility between the
Prisons Service management and Home Office Ministers.
Mr Lewis, who is reportedly seeking a #160,000 pay-off from the Home
Office following his sacking, agreed there was a need for balance
between security and rehabilitation which was not reflected in some
aspects of the Learmont report.
In his final annual report, published yesterday, Judge Tumim called
for a national policy to fight drug abuse by prisoners. He warned of
mounting evidence of hard- drug abuse in all kinds of prisons.
He said: ''The dominance of hard-drug taking as a sub-cultural
activity negates positive aspects of the regime and undermines the
service's strategies.''
In response, the Prison Service's acting director general, Mr Richard
Tilt, cited achievements including a significant fall in the number of
escapes; a 6% fall in the number of assaults; an increase in the hours
spent on constructive activities, with inmates spending an average of 26
hours a week on work, education, and training; an increase in the number
of prisoners unlocked for at least 12 hours a day, from 24% in April
1993 to 40% in 1994/95.

A STAFF nurse who left a helpless mental patient tied by the neck with
her apron tapes to a toilet -- with fatal consequences -- was ordered to
be struck off yesterday.
A colleague who acquiesced with her in leaving the 43-year-old woman
unattended, and then tried to cover up the facts, was severely cautioned
by the nurses' professional conduct committee.
Mrs Wendy McGuigan, 29, of North Campbell Road, Innellan, Argyll, a
former staff nurse on the Erica Ward at Stallington Hall Hospital, Stoke
on Trent, Staffordshire, had been found guilty of tying ''Miss A'' on to
the inlet pipe of a toilet with the apron tapes on May 13, 1992, while
she went for lunch.
Mrs Caroline Stockley, 30, of Uttoxeter Road, Stoke, an acting charge
nurse at the hospital, was found guilty of leaving Miss A -- an
epileptic -- unattended while she joined Mrs McGuigan for lunch.
Miss A was later found hanging by the apron tapes.
Both women had told investigators that Miss A had not been tied to the
inlet pipe of the toilet but had just been secured to the handle, in
accordance with normal practice at the time.
Following a disciplinary hearing, both women were sacked and were
subsequently prosecuted at Birmingham Crown Court for offences involving
reckless neglect of their patient but were acquitted on the direction of
the judge.
Mrs McGuigan had denied the charges by letter. Mrs Stockley, who
sobbed throughout the hearing, said she had no intention of practising
as a nurse again.

THE son of former Liberal Party leader Sir David Steel was jailed for
nine months yesterday for cultivating cannabis with a potential street
value of #30,000 at his country cottage.
Graeme Steel, 29, felt that, because of his father's high public
profile, it would have been too risky to buy the drug on the street from
dealers.
Steel admitted producing cannabis between April 1993 and October last
year at the 200-year-old cottage at Mitchelson Farm, Stow, near
Galashiels, where he lives with his girlfriend, Miss Lynne Turnbull, 28.
Miss Turnbull faced the same charge but the Crown accepted her plea of
not guilty.
Steel pretended to a local farmer that he had planted tomatoes in a
rough shelter made out of plastic sheeting but when police raided the
cottage following a tip-off, they discovered 40 cannabis plants with a
potential value of #30,000.
In the cottage, which Steel and his girlfriend had renovated, police
also found four pipes used for smoking cannabis and booklets describing
how to grow the drug.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said Steel and his girlfriend had led a
self-sufficient lifestyle, growing vegetables and breeding pedigree
dogs.
He explained that his client had grown the cannabis for his own use
and it would have provided him with a year's supply.
Steel had written articles and spoken on radio in support of the
decriminalisation of cannabis resin and had not seen himself as a danger
to society by growing the plants.
Mr Ogg added: ''He was very conscious that due to the very high public
profile his father has in politics, any attempt to buy cannabis on the
streets would be very obvious.
''It would reflect very badly on his father. He wishes to avoid the
criminality associated with the purchasing of drugs.
''He does recognise the foolishness of what he has done and is deeply
aware of the distress he has caused other members of his family.''
Mr Ogg disputed the #30,000 value for the drugs produced by the Crown.
He said this was a potential street value but there was no intention
that the drugs would be on the street. Expert evidence for the defence
put the value of the crop at between #500 and #4800.
Lord Cameron, who had deferred sentence for background reports, told
Steel at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday that he had cultivated
the drugs in full knowledge of the law.
''I would be failing in my public duty if I did not mark disapproval
of the conduct in which you engaged.''
After the hearing, Mr George More, Steel's solicitor, said: ''Graeme
has strong views in regard to the legalisation of cannabis.
''He is very disappointed to be given a prison sentence, although
grateful it was not longer, in a situation where he feels he has done
nothing which endangers the public at large through growing cannabis
plants for himself.''

LABOUR officials last night dismissed as ''exaggerated rubbish''
claims about complaints after the selection of Mr Frank Doran as
prospective parliamentary candidate in the new seat of Aberdeen Central.
Mr Doran represented Aberdeen South before being defeated by
Conservative Raymond Robertson in the 1992 General Election. He was
selected nine days ago, defeating veteran Aberdeen North MP Bob Hughes
by a single vote.
Mr Hughes will now retire from parliamentary life at the next General
Election.
Yesterday, claims emerged that a group of members within Aberdeen
Central Constituency Labour Party were unhappy with aspects of the
events which led to Mr Doran's selection.
According to a report broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland's People and
Power programme yesterday, the group say they have compiled a dossier of
complaints and plan to send it to the Scottish Labour Party's HQ in
Glasgow.
It is alleged Mr Doran's supporters managed to obtain a list of all
the members in the CLP and that visits were made to the homes of a
number of members to canvass their support. It is understood the
complainers believe both these actions breach the party's code of
conduct governing candidates.
However, Mr Jack McConnell, Scottish Labour Party general secretary,
told The Herald last night: ''There have been no complaints either
verbally or in writing to any Labour Party officer or official since the
selection meeting. The selection was final and that was accepted by
everybody present.
''Bob Hughes has said that he accepts the selection decision and that
it was a democratic and fair vote. If it is good enough for Bob Hughes
then it is good enough for me and for the Labour Party.''
Asked whether either of the alleged actions constituted a breach of
the code of conduct, Mr McConnell replied that the radio report was
''exaggerated rubbish''.
Mr Doran could not be contacted for comment last night but it is known
that he denies doing anything in contradiction of the code.

THOUSANDS of Scots who lived near asbestos factories or user
industries could be eligible for compensation for disease or bereavement
they have suffered as a result.
Clydeside in particular could produce shoals of claims in the wake of
a legal ruling against an asbestos company yesterday.
Mr Justice Holland decided at Leeds High Court that June Hancock, who
developed asbestos-related mesothelioma, a form of cancer, more than 40
years after playing near the J W Roberts asbestos factory in Armley,
Leeds, was entitled to #65,000 compensation.
Evelyn Margereson, whose 66-year-old husband Arthur died from the same
disease in 1991 after playing outside the factory in the 1930s, was
awarded #50,000.
Legal experts predict that the ruling will open the floodgates for
similar cases. Mrs Hancock's solicitor, Adrian Budgen, said: ''This has
been regarded as a test case, and it puts other manufacturers on notice.
There may be up to 500,000 deaths in Britain during the next 30 years as
a result of coming into contact with asbestos.''
Clydebank was once home to an asbestos factory, and the whole Clyde
area was prone to exposure from shipyards and locomotive works.
Solicitor-advocate Frank Maguire, who has handled many Glasgow
compensation cases, pointed out that yesterday's cases had been
relatively weak -- the fact that they had been successful strengthened
other cases.
Mrs Hancock, 59, was given two years to live in 1994 after developing
the same disease as had killed her mother. The court heard that asbestos
dust coated the streets where both she and Mr Margereson grew up. They
even played in the factory's loading bay and made ''snowballs'' out of
the dust.
Mr Justice Holland ruled that the company owed the children a duty of
care because at the time it knew that ''children were particularly
vulnerable to personal injury arising out of the inhalation of asbestos
dust.''
Shaking after the verdict was announced, Mrs Hancock, a payroll
manageress, from Bramley, Leeds, said: ''I feel totally elated and I'm
very pleased it's all over. It's been very tiring and traumatic and I
feel it proves that, however small, you are you can fight, and, however
big, you can lose.''
Multinational Turner and Newall, which owned the J W Roberts factory,
is considering an appeal against the judgment. It no longer produces
asbestos, but was once the world's largest manufacturer of the product.
The company, whose shares were hit hard after the ruling was
announced, issued a statement which said: ''T&amp;N believes the judge was
wrong to find T&amp;N liable in these cases. The factory closed almost 40
years ago.''
On Monday, the Chase Manhattan bank launches a #117m lawsuit against
T&amp;N for the asbestos contamination of its New York headquarters.
Meanwhile, the GMB union has called for all asbestos products to be
banned in the light of the ruling.

TRADE unions yesterday demanded immediate action at the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Board headquarters in Glasgow after an independent
survey revealed the premises were suffering symptoms of ''sick building
syndrome''.
The study at Tay House, conducted by Strathclyde University in May,
highlighted a number of problems, including noise, inadequate supply of
fresh air, and a lack of control over ventilation which indicates the
building, which overlooks the M8, is ''sick''.
The 300-strong workforce, which deals with claims from those who are
injured or become ill as a result of crime, moved in to the new offices,
sub-let by Property Holdings, in February.
Earlier this year, unions threatened to call in the Health and Safety
Executive after staff complained of a mystery ''illness'', which caused
headaches, nausea, and facial cold sores in extreme cases. Staff blamed
bacteria in the heating and ventilation system at the building for the
condition.
The Civil and Public Servants' Association, which commissioned the
survey, has now branded the situation ''totally unsatisfactory and
unacceptable'' and has requested an urgent meeting with management. A
copy of the study has been passed to management.
The survey also revealed 30% of staff suffer regular headaches, sore
eyes, blocked noses or stress. More than 80% said the offices were too
hot, while nearly 90% said their workplace was too stuffy.
Ms Claire Docherty of the CPSA said: ''The results of this survey are
extremely disconcerting and must give those responsible great cause for
concern. They show that, for many months, staff have been working in a
poor environment which is affecting their health and, so far,
management's attempts to rectify the problems have not been good enough.
''Sick building syndrome is a long-term problem that requires drastic
action. There has to be a proper investigation.''
She said the option of calling in the HSE could be considered at a
later stage.
Ms Docherty said management were also being pressed for the results of
a second air quality test conducted on the building in June.
No-one was available for comment on behalf of Property Holdings
yesterday.

* The High Court yesterday cleared the way for a legal consortium
based in London and Nottingham to prepare a mass action for damages on
behalf of people with smoking-related diseases.
Mr Justice Sedley said: ''Many of the claimants are chronically or
acutely ill and don't have many years of life to look forward to. Speed
is of the absolute essence.''
He rejected an application for leave to seek judicial review of the
decision brought by 61 claimants, who are among 300 smoking victims
currently represented by Ord &amp; Co, a firm of solicitors based in
Liverpool.
Later, Liz Ord, the firm's principal partner said: ''A lot of sick and
disabled clients with very little income are now being forced away from
a legal specialist firm which deals with this kind of case all the time
to firms on the other side of the country with whom they have had no
contact and have no knowledge of.''
Indicating that an appeal was being considered, she said it was the
first time the Legal Aid Board had awarded an ''all-work'' contract of
this kind.
She added: ''Today's decision means that every single smoking case in
this country will be dealt with through the consortium.''
The board awarded the contract to a consortium consisting of three law
firms: Leigh Day &amp; Co and Bindman and Partners, both based in London,
and Freeth Cartright Hunt Dickins, a firm based in Nottingham.
Mr Colin Stutt, a legal adviser of the Legal Aid Board, said: ''We
believe we have put the best contract arrangements in place to progress
these claims effectively in the interests of the clients.''

AFTER a year of intensive fund-raising, The Herald Foundation Clinic
for Women was opened officially yesterday by Baroness Smith of
Gilmorehill.
The medical suite for gynaecological and related disorders is the
first of its kind in Scotland and is situated in Glasgow's Royal
Infirmary. In welcoming and soothing surroundings, it combines an
innovative approach to care management using the most advanced
equipment.
The clinic is consultant-led and after GP referral will offer women
the kind of hi-tech treatment facility which avoids calling a patient
back repeatedly to different venues and often to different doctors.
Among its many special features is its relaxing atmosphere, achieved
by imaginative interior design and the use of pictures by notable
Scottish artists.
Touring the clinic yesterday, Lady Smith, widow of the former Labour
leader, discovered that one of the coloured etchings was by her
sister-in-law, Ann Smith, a teacher in Dunfermline, who created the
illustration of Iona in memory of her brother. Mr John Smith is buried
on the island.
Lady Smith praised the attention to detail in creating the clinic's
friendly atmosphere. ''You feel you are stepping into a different world.
The concept of total care is very impressive,'' she said.
The clinic's decor was designed by Mr Drew Plunkett, head of interior
design at Glasgow School of Art, and the pictures were assembled by The
Herald's art critic Clare Henry.
In his opening remarks, Mr George McKechnie, editor of The Herald,
said: ''It is particularly heartening to see projects that are talked
about actually happen. Thanks to the generosity of our readers, this
venture is well on its way. The Herald Clinic for women on its own won't
make an impact on the shocking Scottish health statistics but it is a
very positive and very real step in the right direction.''
If only one life is saved, Mr McKechnie said, the project has been
worthwhile. ''If it can improve the quality of life for several dozen
more, it is also worthwhile.''
Increasingly, medical research shows that humanising the institutional
nature of hospitals not only relieves tension for patients and staff
alike, it actually speeds recovery. Plants and paintings are not simply
decorative but have a real therapeutic role.
''This total concept of care creates a special ambience,'' said Lady
Smith.
The #100,000 appeal to fund the clinic was launched a year ago by the
Speaker of the House of Commons, Miss Betty Boothroyd. It has now
reached just over half that sum.
The facility is the brainchild of Dr Helen McEwan, a senior
gynaecologist at the Royal and well known for her pioneering initiatives
in women's health. It is being regarded as a prototype of advanced
investigative treatment and care for women, which will be widely
influential throughout the country.
Sister Joyce Bennett, in charge of the unit, reflects the views of
doctors, staff, and patients when she says: ''It's a delight to work in
such a soothing environment. Patients already tell us they find it
beneficial.''
A special seminar was held after the official opening yesterday to
explain to GPs exactly how the clinic will operate and how they can
refer women to it.

FRANCE last night carried out the third of its bitterly criticised
series of nuclear weapons tests in the South Pacific, the Paris defence
ministry said.
CND announced in response that it would mount a large demonstration
outside Chequers, the Prime Minister's country home, when Mr Major meets
French President Jacques Chirac tomorrow.
President Chirac looks set to face a series of protests during his
visit -- including another one planned outside the Foreign Office in
Whitehall on Monday.
Paris announced that the underground blast, equivalent to less than 60
kilotonnes of conventional explosives, was detonated at Mururoa atoll in
French Polynesia.
Mr Chirac has promised to sign a treaty banning all future tests after
the current series is completed by next May 31.

A POOLS syndicate which was cheated out of #2.3m will have to overturn
a centuries-old rule of Scots law if is to recover the cash from
Littlewoods.
The syndicate, from Stirling, lost out on the jackpot when agent
Cameron Baxter pocketed its #5 stake money instead of handing it on to
Littlewoods.
He was later jailed for 30 months after he admitted forming a
fraudulent scheme to obtain the stake money for his own use.
The syndicate had the only winning line that week and would have
collected more than #2.3m.
Following Baxter's conviction, the members of the syndicate raised
#30,000 to finance an action against Littlewoods in the Court of
Session.
In its defences to the action, the pools company is arguing that it
cannot be held liable since gaming contracts cannot be enforced under
Scots law.
According to the case of Wordsworth v Pettigrew in 1799, the basis for
refusing actions of this kind is not because they are illegal but
because they are regarded as ''sponsiones ludicrae'' -- unworthy of
occupying judicial time.
Yesterday, Mr Cameron Fyfe, who is acting for the syndicate, said: 'If
they are successful with this plea, they will have done nothing but
welch on this bet.'
Mr Fyfe said he believed the law in this area, dating back to a time
when there were no legitimate bookmakers, pools companies, and no
National Lottery, was out of date.
He added: ''What an outcry there would be if someone was unable to sue
the lottery organisers if they decided not to pay out on a winning
ticket.'
If the syndicate could persuade the court to allow the action against
Littlewoods to go ahead it would then have to show that Cameron Baxter
was in all practical respects an agent of Littlewoods, which was
therefore responsible for his actions.
''We are confident we can prove that.''
Ms Mary Ferguson, one of the syndicate, said: ''We feel that
Littlewoods have blatantly cheated us. They seem to be flying in the
face of justice.

THE National Lotteries Charity Board will be urged today to heed the
needs of less conspicuous charities when it allocates grants.
Mr Norman Dunning, director of Enable, the largest voluntary
organisation in Scotland, will tell its annual conference at North
Berwick that it has ended its financial year with an ''alarming''
deficit of nearly #90,000, partly due to people giving money to the
lottery.
Another reason, he will say, is the effect of fund-raising campaigns
by better-known charities, which can divert funds from ''less up-front
but equally necessary charitable work''.
The deficit, he says, would have been much greater if Enable had not
gained on the sale of its former head office.
Mr Dunning, although he is pleased to see the lotteries board has
recognised the contribution made by local community groups fighting
poverty in its first pay-out, will urge the board to look at the needs
of organisations such as Enable.
They are organisations that, year in and year out, ''campaign, advise,
and advocate on behalf of some of the most vulnerable members of society
but do not have huge emotional appeal to the general public''.
A spokeswoman for Enable said it recognised its campaigning and
information role had never been more necessary in a climate where
community care appeared to be faltering and local government
re-organisation was likely to disrupt services.
Communication is the theme of the conference, which continues until
tomorrow.
Enable, which has 6000 members and represents the interests of people
with learning disabilities, was formerly the Scottish Society for the
Mentally Handicapped.
* Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of Edinburgh District Council, said
on Voluntary Sector Television that the Scottish Office would cut its
funding to local authorities next year and this would make it very
difficult for the authorities to decide on their priorities and fund
organisations even to the present level.

Row after ship sails away with 50 tonnes of drugs
EXCLUSIVE
THE Government was launched into a political storm last night after it
emerged that a ship escaped from a Scottish port with nearly 50 tonnes
of cannabis on board and not the 20 tonnes claimed by official figures.
The illegal drugs from South America, worth #200m on the black market,
are nearly the equivalent of what Customs officers seized last year in
Scotland.
Last night, Opposition MPs and trade unions lined up to fire a
broadside at the Government which is planning to cut Customs officers'
ranks by 20%.
Hard-pressed Customs officers missed uncovering the cache three months
ago because of a shortage of manpower. As a team of officers was
preparing to search the 13,593-tonne Polish vessel Krakow II, which had
tied up in Invergordon, Easter Ross, some of the officers were called
away to search another suspicious vessel at Ullapool.
As a result, neither search was as comprehensive as normal and nothing
was found on either ship. However, the Customs officers were unhappy and
relayed their suspicions to their opposite numbers in Norway.
As the vessel reached Stavanger, Norwegian officers swung into action
and uncovered 20 tonnes of cannabis -- described as one of the biggest
cannabis seizures in Europe this year.
However, The Herald was alerted to the true amount of drugs recovered
by a copy of a Customs intelligence report which was sent anonymously to
the paper.
It says: ''When the vessel arrived in Norway, a full vessel search
resulted in the seizure of 21.7 tonnes of cannabis in drums from one
container. A search of another container revealed 27.7 tonnes in empty
cigarette boxes wrapped in polythene.''
The revelation comes at a time when the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants is already fighting the Government over drastic cutback
plans which will see 542 anti-smuggling staff made redundant, with the
most severe cutbacks in more remote parts of the country.
Seven Customs and Excise offices in Scotland are due to be closed,
with a further six earmarked for closure. Over the next four years,
Scotland's force of 1650 is to fall by between 300 and 350.
Last night, Labour's home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said he
would try to raise the disclosure in the Commons next week.
''This is an exceptional piece of information that The Herald has
uncovered and it has to be congratulated on it. It shows the dangers of
listening to Government rhetoric which says everything in the garden is
rosy.
''Labour is strongly opposed to the proposed Customs cutbacks. The
Customs men are a thin line between the drug barons and mayhem on the
streets. Our defences are weak enough without the Government harming
them even further.''
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the
revelation was a source of embarrassment for the Government.
''I have already expressed concerns that the reduction in manpower
would leave us vulnerable to drug smugglers and this adds to those
concerns.''
The episode underlined the fact that the Customs men were being
stretched too thinly. ''I would call on the Government to think again.''
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, SNP home affairs spokeswoman, called on the
Government to abandon any further cuts and to reinstate any that already
had been made.
The revelation that 50 tonnes of drugs were involved made the case far
more serious. Shipments like this could be missed in the future if the
Government continued with its obsessive cost cutting, she said.
Mr Bill Johnston, NUCPS branch secretary, asked why the general public
had not been told the real figure.
''Perhaps it could be that it might embarrass our management who are
trying to cut our numbers by 20%. They said the drugs were not destined
for Scotland but how can they be sure? Did they have a label stamped on
them saying 'not to be opened in Scotland'?''
''It is the biggest seizure of drugs we could have made when you
consider that 63 tonnes was seized during the whole of last year.
''We say that the cuts are all politically driven. They have nothing
to do with efficiency and effectiveness. They are more to do with having
a smaller civil service, a cut in the public sector borrowing
requirement, and a tax cut at the end of the day for the electorate.''
He said the most worrying aspect of the planned cuts was that they
would leave only Oban, Ullapool, Inverness, and Campbeltown to cover the
whole of the most remote areas of the Scottish coast.
The department had decided to concentrate its efforts against drugs on
the south coast of England, leaving drug barons to go in the back door
of Scotland.
A Customs spokesman said he believed that 20 tonnes of cannabis had
been recovered from the Krakow. When told The Herald believed it to be
nearer 50, he replied: ''There have been suggestions over the past few
weeks that it was a larger amount. My best information is that it was in
the region of 20 tonnes.''
He said Customs and Excise management considered the seizure to have
been a joint success with Norway. ''All the drugs were prevented from
getting into the network.''
They believed theirs was the right way forward. ''We have to look at
more sophisticated methods such as increasing the people in intelligence
gathering, working closely with the police, and fast-response teams.''
To help these teams, they were thinking of leasing a helicopter.
''That is the way forward,'' he said.

<TEXT>
DJ claimed to be Canadian premier.
THE Queen has been hoaxed by a disc jockey in Quebec who telephoned
her claiming to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Buckingham
Palace said last night.
Her unwitting conversationwith Pierre Brassard was about the major
controversy confronting Canada this weekend -- the possibility that
Quebec will vote for independence in a referendum on Monday.
But after part of the Queen's comments were broadcast on the DJ's
programme, Le Bleu Poudre, on Montreal radio station CKOI FM, a
Buckingham Palace spokesman dismissed the elaborate hoax as ''an
irritation''.
The call was put through to the Queen at the Palace by her private
office after careful checks had been made with Canadian Government
officials -- who did not doubt its authenticity, he said.
A series of calls were made to the palace to prepare for the eventual
telephone conversation between the ''Prime Minister'' and the Queen. M
Chretien is currently away from his office campaigning on the Quebec
separation issue.
''This was a carefully-contrived confidence trick. This person
misrepresented himself throughout.
''M Chretien is well known to the Queen and to senior Palace
officials, but the hoaxer is clearly able to mimic the Canadian Prime
Minister exactly. We are told that he has done this kind of thing
before.
''It is regrettable, particularly that someone should misrepresent
themselves as a head of government in this way.
''Hoaxers may have tried to get through to the Queen in the past, but
they didn't succeed. The fact that this person did get through is an
irritant when the Queen has more important things do do.''
The DJ is thought to have suggested to the Queen that she should make
a broadcast to the Canadian people, urging that they should recognise
the need for national unity.
The Palace was declining to give details, but it is understood the
Queen indicated that she was prepared to consider making such a
broadcast, but wanted to see the suggested text.
The Palace spokesman said the Queen clearly had to take the advice of
her Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and had every reason to believe she
was speaking to one of them on this occasion.
Careful checks had been made, as they were when any caller asked to be
put through to the Queen or tried to arrange such a call, he said.
In this case, the first calls purported to be from the office of the
Canadian Prime Minister, making the arrangements for the eventual
conversation.
Members of the Queen's private office duly telephoned the office of M
Chretien, and were told that he was away campaigning about the Quebec
separation issue.
But his staff believed it was reasonable to assume he would want to
talk to the Queen over such an important matter, and raised no doubts
about the authenticity of the planned call.
The hoax soon came to light, when Palace officials telephoned the
Canadian Prime Minister's office to ask about the suggested text for the
possible broadcast.
Pierre Brassard is reported to have made similar hoax calls to the
past, once getting through to Pope John-Paul.
Last night, the Palace spokesman said: ''Since the hoax, he has been
in touch with us making it clear that he saw it as an innocuous
practical joke.
''He said he never intended to make the person of the Queen, or the
Crown, or Great Britain, look ridiculous in any way.''
This time the DJ made no attempt to telephone, he said. ''He sent the
message by fax.''
The Canadian Government had also said it regretted the embarrassment
caused to the Queen by the incident, although there was no question of
it being M Chretien's fault, the Palace spokesman said.
The radio station claimed tonight the hoax appeared to have boosted
the Queen's popularity in Canada, even among those who did not share her
commitment to national unity.
''We have been deluged with calls from listeners,'' said spokeswoman
Cathya Attar. ''People accept her views against separation -- that's
only normal who has been Queen of Canada from the beginning.
''She said she would be extremely happy to help Canada any way she
could. She wouldn't like Canada to separate.
''But what everyone is talking about is how very approachable she is.
Considering the fact that she is a royal person, she is very simple.
''She has a great sense of humour and laughed a lot. She spoke French
during part of the conversation, and people were quite impressed with
how well she did.''
She described Brassard as a 29-year-old ''humourist'' who, with two
colleagues, had presented a successful evening ''drive-time'' programme
for nearly a decade.
With 1.4 million listeners, the station claimed to be the biggest in
Canada, and Brassard had become highly popular, she said.
''M Brassard is always impersonating famous people, leading
politicians and showbusiness personalities. He adopts not only their
voice but their mannerisms and style of speech as well.
''He has developed an idea where he does what he calls his 'coups'
where he telephones someone very famous pretending to be someone equally
famous. He got through to the Pope and Brigitte Bardot, for instance.
''This call to the Queen was perfectly timed because of the referendum
on Monday.''
When he had suggested a nationwide TV broadcast appealing for unity,
the Queen had asked him to fax her a text of what the Canadian
Government would like her to say.
She had said: ''If I can help in any way, I will be very happy to do
so.''
M Brassard had included many jokes which the Queen appeared to enjoy,
said Ms Attar.
Asked if she was doing anything for Hallowe'en, the Queen had said:
''Yes, certainly for the children,'' but said she did not have any plans
for a costume.
''Just put on a hat,'' suggested M Brassard, telling her he would send
her an extra fax filled with jokes.
Later Pierre Brassard said he enjoyed tricking his targets but did not
want to do them any harm.
''We don't want to get anyone into hot water when we call people on
the phone like that,'' he said. ''We may start talking on a political
pretext, but we move on to other things.''
