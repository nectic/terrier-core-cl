THE Government is going to have to do something about the quality of
financial advice, if its aim of rolling back the welfare state and
making us all much more responsible for our own financial well-being is
to succeed.
The evidence of abuse is now overwhelming. The Office of Fair Trading
has recently criticised the way banks and building societies have pushed
endowment mortgages. We have had the scandal of the misselling of
personal pensions. And now Which? magazine tells us that, in spite of
new rules on disclosure of commission and expenses, financial advisers
are still doling out advice which is motivated by greed rather than the
best interests of their clients.
Evidence of poor financial advice is generally anecdotal. The Which?
report offers firm proof that, even faced with relatively simple
financial problems, advisers are still getting it shockingly wrong.
Which? visited 35 advisers. Twenty firms were asked for advice from an
actor posing as a 40-year-old divorcee with two children. He was looking
for long-term savings and some additional life insurance. He was making
maximum contributions to his employer's pension and he already had a
PEP, although he wasn't contributing as much as he could. He had
building society savings of #8000 a year.
The best advice would be to increase contributions into his PEP, or
start a unit trust savings plan, and take out some term insurance.
The second actor visited 15 firms posing as a 60-year-old hoping to
retire in the next five to 15 years. He was self-employed with variable
earnings. He could expect a pension from a previous employer's scheme
but would like to add to this, although he wouldn't be able to save more
than an average of #50 a month.
The best advice for someone with a variable income would be to make a
series of single premium payments into a personal pension. Those with
regular monthly payments have higher charges and offer less flexibility.
Very few financial advisers came up with the right answers. In the
case of the divorcee, half the 20 firms recommended an inappropriate
endowment or other high charging policy. Only four suggested the correct
solution. One adviser proposed an endowment policy at the first
interview, but changed this advice on a second visit when he was being
supervised by a manager.
In the second case only three advisers recommended and explained the
single premium personal pension alternative. A further three mentioned
it as an option for topping up regular monthly payments. Nine out of 15
suggested a monthly payment personal pension.
Which? concludes that the new rules on disclosure of commission and
expenses will make it much easier for people to shop around for policies
which offer the best value for money, but says financial advisers must
be more effectively monitored.
Mortages are outside the scope of the Financial Services Act, so banks
and building societies aren't covered by the rules which require
financial advisers to give the best possible advice. However, they are
covered by the new rules on disclosure of commission and expenses when
they sell an endowment policy. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
the Office of Fair Trading wants the Act extended to mortgage advice.
A recent OFT report warned that people should no longer rely on
endowment policies to repay their mortgages. This is likely to be a
particular problem for those who have taken them out in the last five
years when worldwide investment returns have been falling.
Endowment mortgages are heavily promoted by the banks and building
societies because of the high level of commission they earn from the
life insurance companies who issue the policies. This can be as much as
#800 for recommending a policy taken out to cover a #50,000 loan. The
popularity of endowments grew throughout the eighties to the point where
some 84% of all mortgages came packaged with one. They have fallen out
of favour since, although they still account for six out of every 10
mortgages.
Anyone who has had an endowment mortgage for more than 10 years should
stick with it because they will be benefiting from the high bonus rates
which continued to be paid right up to the end of the eighties. Ask the
insurance company for a projection of the final maturity value every
couple of years, and if there is an apparent shortfall, think about
taking out some extra savings either with a Tessa or a PEP.
People who have taken out an endowment mortage over the last five
years have more difficult decisions to make. They could switch to a
repayment plan which repays the mortgage as you go along. But if they
then cash in their endowment policy, or sell it on the second-hand
market, they will get back less than they have paid into it.
If they stay with the endowment, they must accept they may have to
bump up their savings at some stage. A third option would be to opt for
a repayment mortgage and keep the endowment going. The policy could be
cashed in as soon as it acquired a decent surrender value and the money
used to repay some of the mortgage early.
These are complicated decisions. The problem is where to go for
impartial advice. On the evidence of the Which? report it is still very
hard to find.

A SHARP advance by sterling against the retreating Deutschmark
overshadowed a mixed set of industrial production figures for March.
Kenneth Clarke's ''If I judge it necessary to put up interest rates
again, I shall not hesitate to do so'' speech to the Sheffield Cutlers'
Feast on Thursday night has helped to reassure foreign exchange markets
after the damage done by the rift with the Governor of the Bank of
England.
After the uncompromising line taken by the Bank in its latest
quarterly report the betting in the City is that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer will heed the Governor's advice on the need for a tighter
monetary policy when the two men meet again on June 7.
If this turns out to be the case rates will go up with just one
month's delay. But after the unexpected outcome of the May meeting there
will be plenty of hedging of bets in the City ahead of the next
confrontation.
However, most of the pound's recovery in the last three days can be
attributed to a strong rebound by the dollar after 18 months in the
doldrums. The markets are warming to the idea that the US Federal
Reserve has achieved a soft landing for the American economy with
inflation checked without a huge increase in interest rates. Moreover
there have been hints from German monetary officials that the Bundesbank
may have one more rate cut in it yet.
So money has been flowing out of the safe-haven currencies, such as
the German mark, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, back into the
dollar and even sterling. But there is little likelihood that either the
dollar or the pound will retrieve all their losses.
Yesterday the pound was making headway all round the wicket with an
advance of 4.66 pfennigs to DM2.2706 and 1.30 cents to $1.5705. At one
point it went as high as DM2.2845, nearly 10 pfennigs above its all-time
low of DM2.1760, recorded as recently as Tuesday.
The trade-weighted index, which hit a record low of 82.7 on Tuesday,
rose 1.3 yesterday to 84.7. This is 0.3 higher than it was on Thursday
night of last week before it was torpedoed by the Chancellor's decision.
At the current level it has still lost 4.3% of its international value
this year. So the problem of sterling's fall from grace, identified by
the Bank of England, as the main justification for the need for a
tightening of the monetary screw, is still at the top of the agenda for
the June 7 meeting.
Industrial production rose by 0.9% in March, taking the year-on-year
rate of increase up from 3.6% to 5%. But in the latest three months the
trend was lacklustre with output just 0.1% higher than in the final
quarter of last year. Against the same three months a year ago growth
was 4.2%.
The March figure was boosted by a sharp upturn in North Sea oil and
gas output to a fresh record and a good recovery by the energy
industries which had been hit by weak demand in an especially mild
February.
Manufacturing, however, continues to return surprisingly weak figures.
Factory output rose by just 0.3% in March for year-on-year growth of
3.8% against 3.2% in February. In the latest three months manufacturing
output fell back by 0.1% and against the same three months a year ago
the rise was 3.4%.
The official figures showing that manufacturing has been broadly flat
since last September, and this, together with weak retail sales, has
been cited as evidence of a significant slowdown in economic activity.
Proponents of this line of thinking include the Chancellor himself.
The Bank of England takes the opposite view. It looks at the total
picture of the economy rather than the partial one presented by any
single indicator. Official figures showed gross domestic product grew by
0.8% in the first quarter, the same as in the final three months of last
year. Almost all of the growth was put down to a booming services
sector.
In addition the Bank is suspicious of the manufacturing figures which
contrast with the buoyancy of the survey evidence from the likes of the
CBI.
One particular puzzle in the latest figures is the 0.4% decline in the
output of the investment goods industries between the latest two
quarters. This is difficult to square with the belated upturn in
investment. Output of the intermediate goods industries was flat in the
first quarter and consumer goods industries posted a gain of 0.6%.
The suspicion is that there has been some under-recording of output in
manufacturing and this will result in upward revisions to the official
figures at a later stage. It has happened before and it will happen
again.
It was for this reason that the Bank's economic director, Mervyn King,
argued on Thursday that the first-quarter GDP figures, which had been
rubbished by the Chancellor, were more likely to be revised up than
down.
The figures for oil and gas extraction continue to boom. In the latest
three months North Sea output was 3.2% higher than in the final quarter
of last year and 12.3% above the first quarter of last year. Between
February and March seasonally-adjusted output jumped by 2.6%, surpassing
February's record.

New Labour has silenced the voice of true Labour. Jimmy Reid mourns
the loss of the party's principles in the pursuit of power
HUGH McILVANNEY, sports writer par excellence, told someone who was
rubbishing wordsmiths that ''words were handy if you had something to
say''. There was irony in Hugh's voice, for his assertion was gross
understatement. If you didn't have words you would have nothing to say
anyway. A poet wrote of God: ''He gave man words and words created
thought.'' This link between words and thought is fundamental.
One of my daughters made a little calligraphic poster for me. It sits
on my desk and proclaims, ''The very greatest is the alphabet for in it
lies the deepest wisdom.'' Words and their juxtaposition can convey more
than literal meanings. Your choice of words can reveal hidden or
subconscious thoughts. We even have expressions for such a phenomenon. A
Freudian slip, or in the vernacular, a dead giveway.
Ponder these following words. ''A monstrous religious icon, a graven
image.'' ''No longer do we have to worship false gods, utter prayers
that have lost all meaning.'' They could be the words of an escapee from
a nutcase religious sect in the American Midwest, or one of the Brontes
on a bad day, but they were actually penned by Jack Straw, Shadow Home
Secretary, writing about Clause 4 for the Independent.
There are dark thoughts in them there words. Strong feelings nudging
on hatred, and for something written 77 years ago to convey concepts of
common ownership and democratic control of wealth-producing resources.
Hardly an issue for heavy-metal words which also jar with the cooing
public reassurances given by Labour's leadership that the debate on
Clause 4 was concerned with archaic language, the need for an update, a
simple redefinition of principles in the language of the 1990s. Why
Brian Wilson could do it on the back of an envelope, travelling on a
train, musing about Glasgow Celtic's history, no bother at all.
Then wham -- doomsday talk, Labour in thrall to a monstrous religious
icon, and as sure as words have meaning this meant it was a cult and not
a political party. Monstrous religious icons have high priests who must
be given short shrift. This might explain why there was hatred about.
Arm twisting and threats. It wasn't nice. Tony Blair's nice guy smile is
a put on. He's ruthless.
Since he was elected leader a war of sorts has been waged to make
Labour into a social democratic party which it has been de facto for
years. Blair wants it to be a de jure social democratic party, purged of
all constitutional and linguistic vestiges of what had been party
principles.
There is a coherent argument to be made for a social democratic party
in Britain. Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins made that argument a decade
ago when they left Labour and founded the SDP, before it merged with the
Liberals. After losing the next election there's an even money chance
that the Tories will return to the centrist right politics that served
them well in the days of Macmillan and Butler.
The differences between Blair, Ashdown, and a post-Thatcherite Tory
leader will then be minuscule, guaranteeing rough times ahead, for in
some perverse way, maximum heat among human beings is generated by
minimal differences.
One group of Muslims fought another group of Muslims, with excessive
ferocity, in the Iran/Iraq war. In times past Christians took turns at
burning each other over marginally different interpretations of biblical
texts, some are still at it in what was Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
Trotskyists loathe Trotskyists with a passion that exceeds anything
they feel for those who are to be on the other side of the barricades,
come the revolution. Stalin killed more Stalinists than Hitler. Thatcher
hated Tory Wets but looked benignly on Denis Skinner. Ernest Bevin, told
that Herbert Morrison was his own worst enemy, growled ''not while I'm
alive''.
As the parties huddle ever more closely in the same camping grounds
this hatred for the nearly similar will become more manifest. They can
share everything but bonhomie. This lack of meaningful philosophical and
ideological difference has spawned a political debate which dwells on
effects but never the causes. Trivia prevails. This is also true of
inner-party debate.
Despite what has been claimed, the debate on Clause 4 was bereft of
intellectual depth. Reasoning became fraught. Jack Straw explained the
process by which he came to hate Clause 4 and to love the free market.
He was having lunch with the staff at the British Museum depot, prior to
the 1992 General Election. The staff was, ''mainly middle-class
middle-aged women -- classic swing voters. They talked politely, but
they would not look me in the eye.''
This comes as no surprise. People do tend not to look in the eye of
those inclined to talk of monstrous religious icons and graven images,
even employees of the British Museum, especially over lunch. But back to
Jack's story. ''. . . one woman said her husband was in private
industry, building, and he'd been told there would be many bankruptcies
if Labour won.''
That was all she said, absolutely nothing more. But it was enough for
Jack, his road to Damascus, blinding light and all, was at hand. With
one quantum leap he jumped to the conclusion that Clause 4 was
definitely a monstrous religious icon, graven image to boot, not
forgetting the meaningless prayers bit.
With missionary zeal he declared war on the clause. ''Many colleagues
at Westminster gave me great encouragement, above all Neil Kinnock and
Tony Blair. Neither could be too public about this because of their
close association with the late John Smith, who was less than keen on my
ideas.'' So in the beginning it was rather hush hush. A trifle
conspiratorial. Where did Jack meet Neil and Tony, in the vaults?
Alas, John Smith died. Tony Blair became party leader. The rest is
history. But if that lady's husband hadn't been told that there would be
many bankruptcies if Labour won, and she hadn't told Jack Straw over
lunch in the British Museum depot, then Clause 4 would still be in
Labour's constitution and the next Labour government would have
nationalised everything, including the Independent. Phew. A close shave.
Eh?
Note Straw's reasoning; it's absurd. His language is bizarre, a
discussion within a secular political party couched in terms appropriate
to holy war. But Straw is not just a political warrior, tilting at
socialist windmills, he is a social scientist who now rejects the
''false dichotomy between socialism and capitalism''.
In essence he argues that after thousands of years of evolutionary
development human society has reached its zenith and absolute pinnacle
in modern capitalism. History stops here. In Voltaire's mocking words,
''We are living in the best of all possible worlds.''
Apologists for slavery and feudalism sang this song. It's an old song,
music to the ears of those at the top of the pile. The beneficiaries of
a status quo fervently want the status quo to last forever. It's old
hat.
New Labour is old hat. Among those who founded the Labour Party were
Lib/Lab career politicians who despised socialism. Middle-class men with
an eye to a career in politics who knew promotion was barred to them in
the hierarchical Tory Party of those days. They were ''agin'' the
political establishment because they couldn't be part of it.
They viewed the extension of the franchise to workers as votes which
could take them to the heights of government. They found allies in some
personally ambitious proletarians and trade union leaders who believed
in the liberation of the working class, one by one, starting with
themselves.
Ramsay MacDonald was of that ilk. Born out of wedlock to a poor
Scottish serving girl, he betrayed Labour in the 1930s, and for a wee
while was the darling of all the duchesses in London. A bastard in every
sense.
Non-socialist Labour parliamentarians are extant unto this day. The
gang of four were unable to uphold the socialist principles of Labour
and left to form a new party. Blair and his gang, unable to uphold the
same principles, worked from within to ditch these principles. History
will judge David Owen to have been more honourable than Tony Blair. As a
consequence Labour is now back to where it was before 1918, a party of
the centre.
In a two-party system you can't have one party governing forever. The
British establishment needs a party, to interchange with the Tories,
that will not question its hegemony.
When Labour succeeded the Liberals as a party of government, members
of the establishment must have been excreting bricks. Labour's
constitutional commitment to fundamental social change, while mostly
ignored by Labour governments, was a potential threat to the
establishment.
Labour had to be made a party of the status quo and the then virtually
non-existent differences between the parties could be dramatised to give
the illusion of choice.
The needle between Major and Blair is real, not political but
personal. It is a clash of contending career politicians, fighting for
the same office and not to be confused with the clash of contending
philosophies.
There are different social classes in our society, in every country in
the world. To deny this is like denying the world is round. Yet we have
a Labour leader who talks as if nobody out there was being paid wages or
salaries for their labour. No-one out there paying wages or salaries to
those who sell their labour. Nobody out there paying wages is tempted by
the thought of paying less. No-one out there who is paid wages is
tempted by the thought of being paid more.
There will always be a potential conflict of interest between payers
and paid. Good industrial relations are best served by recognising this
reality and devising procedures which seek to resolve the potential for
conflict.
If this fails or isn't tried and conflict occurs Labour, founded to
support those who are paid wages, declares itself neutral. There is no
such ambiguity with the Tories. They have never supported workers in a
dispute, yet by the law of averages, the workers were bound to have been
right sometime. The Tories take this attitude because they were founded
to support the interests of those who pay wages, and they remain loyal
to their roots.
Tony Blair rarely mentions socialism, he never mentions capitalism,
which is very strange. Capitalism dominates today's world. The free
market is a fundamental part of the capitalist system. Capitalism is a
precise and legitimate word. Its non-use is inexplicable unless there is
a language difficulty. Think of capitalism and you might also think of
capital and labour and trade unions, etc, etc.
New Labour has expunged from its vocabulary all words that remind
people of Labour's history, its raison d'etre. It has abandoned its
distinctive philosophy. The cumulative effect of these factors has led
to semantic chaos. How to say nothing and make it sound something.
Bright people end up speaking gobbledegook.
In the speeches of Labour's leader, the vast complex of social
problems -- crisis in the health service and our schools, alienation,
the hopelessness and despair of millions in our inner cities and
peripheral housing schemes, drugs, lawlessness, the contrast of wealth
and poverty, urban squalor, the atmospheric pollution which sent people
flocking to hospitals where they were put on ventilators when the sun
shone in London -- have nothing to do with the prevailing socio-economic
system. It's all down to ministerial incompetence. There are no
objective factors operating, only subjective deficiencies.
The Shadow Chancellor recently spoke of how he will deliver a dynamic
market economy. Does he mean a constantly dynamic market economy not
subject to recessions? The implication is that if New Labour had been in
power during the past four years it would have steered Britain to
dynamic growth despite the recession in the global market economy. That
cannot be true.
The capitalist free market is subject to cyclical recessions which
destroy or atrophy resources, while contradictions between production
and consumption are resolved, often in the crudest of ways, by the
destruction of jobs and communities. That's not an opinion but a fact.
Governments and economists have sought to alleviate or modify this
negative phase in the productive cycle of the global free market economy
and have not yet succeeded. To judge by what it has to say on the matter
the phenomena of capitalist economic crises doesn't seem to exist for
New Labour. But then neither does capitalism.
In all of this it's difficult to discern, in terms of actually
managing the economy, what a Blair government would do that is
significantly different from what the Tories are already doing. There is
certainly no economic or philosophical critique on which a new strategy
could be based.
Within two years New Labour in government will have alienated
millions, destroyed hopes, and have split Labour as in the 1930s, only
this time there will be no world war to lead Labour back from the
wilderness.
Principles do matter. They are not highfalutin abstractions.
Philosophical ideas are important. Political parties and governments
consumed by immediacy end up with no goals beyond winning, and clinging,
to office. We need perspective.
Of course, in a democracy parties have to relate to the concerns of
people, yet they can't simply mirror existing attitudes. That's a cop
out. Parties of principle seek to change as well as reflect the minds of
the people. We hear nothing now of the battle of ideas because our
politicians have no big ideas. You can't lead a crusade on ministerial
incompetence. The function of political parties will now be to provide
career opportunities for career politicians.
New Labour has silenced the distinctive voice of true Labour which
could appeal to conscience and not just wallets. What do you stand for?
asks a voter. What do you want us to stand for? is Labour's reply. This
perception of Labour is growing, breeding a deadly cynicism. Jokes are
already current about Tony Blair. Those obsessed by the prospect of
office can end up in government, hamstrung by the concessions they made
to get there.
New Labour lives by the soundbite, the smile, the glad hand, photo
opportunities, and the superficiality that accompanies the absence of
principle. Yet we have in our grasp the productive and technological
means of creating an abundance to meet the material needs of humankind.
The elimination of poverty throughout the world is now feasible. Only
outmoded sociology stands in the way.
Market mechanisms are necessary for economic efficiency. This is a
lesson of history. The absence of market mechanisms wrought havoc with
the Soviet economy. The alternative was a price-fixing committee and the
command economy. But the acceptance of market mechanisms doesn't
necessarily mean accepting untrammelled market forces. The market has no
moral imperatives. It cannot say ''poverty is not to be tolerated'', but
we can say it. Human beings must control economics, or economics will
control us. The Labour Movement, reflecting these values, put people
centre stage. All of this has been lost. Progress has always meant hard,
down-to-earth, work. But progress is fuelled by dreams.
My Dad wept with joy when Labour won in 1945. He was dreaming of a new
Jerusalem. John Smith would have understood, but not Blair and
Mandelson. Their souls were never seared by the vision splendid.

KILMARNOCK have had the points they won on the opening day of D M Hall
Western Union Championship, when they tied with West of Scotland,
removed for including an ineligible player. The Hamilton Crescent club
have been awarded the full 25 points.
The club, whose ranks have been swelled this season by an influx of
players from Glasgow League side NKOA, had included in their ranks Imran
Idress who had played as a professional in the Central Lancashire
League. On the day he took four wickets and hit 43 runs.
Kilmarnock have as a pro this season the current vice-captain of the
Pakistan Test side, Asif Mujtaba, and their offence was to play Idress
without approaching the Western Union about his reinstatement.
The Western Union prevented Idress playing for Kilmarnock in their
defeat at Kelburne last week and he will not turn out for them at
Drumpellier today. The Western Union is awaiting confirmation from both
Crompton Cricket Club and the Central Lancashire League of his
reinstatement before deciding whether to authorise his appearance for
Kilmarnock.

With the possible exception of an old sailing ship, there are few
modes of long-distance travel more romantic than the railway train. For
mile after mile, it offers relaxed contemplation of varying countryside
from the comfort of an armchair, blissfully free of the stresses of
driving and the anxieties of flying.
There is an element of adventure in cruising along tracks laid through
wild landscapes a century before; of discovery in a kaleidoscope of
unfamiliar vistas; and of companionship among fellow travellers swapping
reminiscences of past journeys.
Robert Louis Stevenson, who considered it better to travel hopefully
than to arrive, was naturally attracted by the thrill of it. ''There are
many ways of seeing landscape, and none more vivid, in spite of canting
dilettanti, than from a railway train,'' he observed.
Stevenson was living in exile in Samoa when Victorian engineers
conceived a railroad traversing Rannoch Moor, the scene of the flight of
David Balfour and Alan Breck in Kidnapped. But one assumes he would have
enjoyed the splendid sight of two bronze-green engines pulling claret
coaches of the North British company across the moor on the ceremonial
opening of the West Highland Railway on August 11, 1894.
The line through a hundred miles of mountain and moorland from
Craigendoran to Fort William, with scarcely a village worthy of the name
in all its length, was a magnificent feat of engineering. ''It throws
open to the public,'' the Railway Herald reported, ''wide and
interesting tracts of country which have been almost as much unknown to
the ordinary tourist hitherto as Central Africa was 10 years ago to the
geographer.''
It also raised serious questions, however, about the business acumen
of the men who built it. The reporter from the Glasgow Evening News who
travelled on the inaugural train wrote: ''A paying traffic must be a
matter of slow growth, and it will test the management severely to make
ends meet long years after the present time.''
A century later, the impending demise of the Fort William-London
Sleeper and Motorail services is an unhappy measure of how British Rail
is still struggling to make ends meet on one of the world's most scenic
railways. Unless the Court of Session upholds a challenge by Highland
Regional councillors, the services will disappear from timetables on May
28.
The sleeper is, of course, the jewel in the West Highland crown. It
may once have been the preserve of kilted Lairds and their ilk, but it
is more likely today to convey tourists mingling happily with gentlefolk
and railway buffs drawn by a last chance to travel on a historic train.
The cost of doing so appears to vary according to which BR clerk one
consults. At Scotrail enquiries, the prices quoted are #84.70 single and
#98 return for standard compartments, and #133 and #266 respectively for
first-class. (The only difference being single as opposed to double
occupancy of identical compartments). At Euston Station, however, I was
presented with a first-class, one-way ticket for #79. Given such
creative accounting, it is hardly surprising that defenders of the night
train say its losses are wildly exaggerated.
The central concourse at Euston does not provide the most promising
start to a romantic journey, especially when it is awash with
dishevelled remnants of Birmingham City's 'Blue Army' celebrating a
minor cup final victory. The first tingle of anticipation comes when one
looks up at the departures board. There, amid prosaic destinations such
as Watford Junction, Milton Keynes, and Wolverhampton, is the notice for
the West Highlander (front portion) to Fort William, and the Royal
Highlander (rear portion) to Inverness. The train already has the air of
a Scottish gentleman surrounded by English ruffians.
The Class K4 steam engines Cameron of Locheil and Lord of the Isles
are long gone, but the Class 96 electric County of Cheshire appears a
sturdy enough workhorse to transport the 18 coaches drawn up behind her
in the cavern of platform 15. My compartment is a snug little room with
a surprisingly comfortable bunk bed, a wash-hand basin beneath a window,
temperature controls, and complementary packs of toiletries and
Caithness Water.
An InterCity brochure on the bed promises ''a dream of a journey''
(just close your eyes and you're there); Denise Brown, Business Manager,
says in the brochure: ''I'm sure you will agree that travelling by
Sleeper is the most civilised and relaxing way to travel long
distance.'' I do indeed, and wonder at British Rail's capacity to look
silly in its own promotional literature.
Michael Hughes-Hallett does not look silly. In his tweeds and rumpled
smile he looks what he is, a director and factor of a Highland woodland
estate by Loch Eil, commuting from his home in the Cotswolds. He is
sitting in the lounge car, ordering a jumbo bacon and tomato roll and
whisky, and lamenting the withdrawal of the service he has relied on for
20 years to convey him to his office in Fort William.
''I feel very strongly about it,'' he says. ''I think it's a terrible
blow to the local economy, and it's awfully inconvenient for me
personally. This is a jolly good train that runs very punctually, and I
shall be very sorry indeed when it is withdrawn.''
Mr Hughes-Hallett fondly recalls unforeseen adventures, such as when a
lorry tumbled down an embankment near Crianlarich a few years ago and
flooded the line with petrol. ''The railway people were frightfully
efficient. Three buses arrived within 20 minutes and we hurtled across
Scotland to Stirling, where we picked up the Inverness train and arrived
in London only a few minutes late.''
He is less enthusiastic about the ''blasted steam trains'' laid on for
tourists on the Fort William-Mallaig section in the summer, which have
an unfortunate propensity for setting his woods on fire. Since the
estate has 8,000 acres of mature woodland worth #12m, it is a serious
problem. On one day alone last year, hot cinders from the steam engines
ignited 24 fires.
It seems the worst period is between mid-March and May, when dried
winter grasses are highly flammable. Pending some kind of settlement
with the railway authorities, Mr Hughes-Hallett has instituted a novel
emergency procedure. Every time the tourist train appears (twice a day),
an estate worker in a Land Rover drives beside it for eight miles along
a forest trail, summoning fire-fighters by mobile telephone when
necessary.
All this I learn as the County of Cheshire whisks us out of the dreary
northern suburbs of London, and smoothly through the green fields of the
Home Counties in the deepening twilight. There is a spatter of rain, and
a motorway appears as a stream of headlamps slashing through the
gathering gloom; the railway carriage seems an island of sanity far
removed from the motorway madness outside the window.
There is a sense of privilege in perusing the menu lying on a white
tablecloth, and looking forward to a good night's sleep, while others
are hunched over the steering wheels of cars and weaving between
juggernauts. This is an express train, and we flash through local
stations too quickly to read the signs, like a railway equivalent of
Concorde.
The Highland Broth served in a china bowl is delicious, but the
lasagne (#3.55) is a disappointment. It emerges from a microwave as a
gelatinous mess, presented in the plastic tray in which it was packaged
by a supermarket supplier. Another passenger finds the chicken tikka
masala and rice (#3.99) equally unappetising. The half-bottle of
Chardonnay (Domaine de Rivoyre 93, #6.25) is not chilled, but Khaled,
the chief steward, assures me he has ''plenty ice'', and duly provides
it.
Far from being a ghost train facing exorcism from BR timetables, the
West Highlander is bustling with life. Khaled tells me all 12
first-class compartments are occupied, as are 40 of the 48 standard
compartments. After dinner, conversation flows between strangers in the
wood-panelled lounge car over nightcaps of malt whisky.
Doris Cox, a retired civil servant from Edinburgh now resident in
London, is travelling to Rhum to visit a schoolteacher she encountered
in the pages of The Scots Magazine. ''It all began when she appealed in
the magazine for old photos of the island and the ferries that used to
service it,'' she says. ''It so happens I've always been a keen amateur
photographer, and I was able to send her some pictures of a ferry that I
took 30 years ago. So now I'm going to visit her, and travelling on this
train is part of the fun.''
Mrs Cox likes trains. She recalls the days when the Golden Arrow was
shipped aboard channel ferries on its way to Paris and Brussels, and
regrets she has been on the West Highlander only a few times. ''I can't
say I've done my bit for the train, so to speak, but it's lovely knowing
it's there,'' she says.
People retire early, and by 9pm there are only a few of us left in the
lounge car. Two boys returning to public schools in Scotland tell us a
ghost story, of mysterious lights in a ruined castle reputed to have
been a refuge of Bonnie Prince Charlie. The boys swear the story is
true, because they have seen the lights.
I return to my compartment and slide gratefully between crisp white
sheets, beneath a tartan blanket, snug as a bug in a travelling rug. It
is reassuring to know that my bed will not fall out of the sky during
the night, or be dismembered in a motorway pile-up. I drift off to
sleep, musing on burning forests, old island ferries, and haunted
castles.
Things go bump in the night, but I am barely aware of them and awake
refreshed when a steward calls at 6.30am with tea and a croissant. I
lift the window blind with a sense of anticipation. What will I see? An
anonymous Lowland landscape, a derelict Glasgow housing estate? Not a
bit of it. The window fills dramatically with the massive bulk of a dark
mountain streaked with snow, rising from wild brown moorland. Beneath a
grey sky, not a sign of human life or habitation is to be seen. The
impression is not so much of distance travelled, as ages passed; it is
as if the West Highlander has whisked us back in time to the heartland
of the Jacobite clans. As we climb from Bridge of Orchy, I half-expect
to see a troop of Redcoats scrambling over Rannoch Moor in pursuit of
Alan Breck.
This is the highlight of the journey, meandering through spectacular
scenery miles from the nearest road and wondering at the tenacity of the
engineers and navvies who brought the railroad through these lonely
mountains. (The West Highland line was completed in five years, at a
cost of #403,638 4s 2d). In the lounge car over breakfast, an English
voice is heard saying: ''We should be grateful they had the vision to do
it, to bequeath it to future generations...''
As we trundle along the eastern shore of Loch Treig, a bank of mist
descends and swirls around crags above the dark waters, eliciting a
chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' from passengers. Margaret Charles, a widow
from Hampshire visiting friends in Scotland, is enchanted. ''It's so
beautiful,'' she says. ''I just wish I had known about this train
before.'' Mrs Charles thinks it is a great pity the service is to end,
and blames BR for not publicising it. ''It's like a lot of things, like
small village shops, when they close people regret it but it's too
late.''
During the night we parted company with the Royal Highlander, which
went careering off to Inverness while we snoozed off towards Lochaber.
The English interloper County of Cheshire has gone, and we are now being
drawn more appropriately by the Class 37 diesel-electric Ben Cruachan,
resplendent in her green livery and red enamel emblem of a West Highland
terrier. We pick up speed on the long descent from Spean Bridge, and
arrive beneath the towering hulk of Ben Nevis on time, 12 and a half
hours after leaving Euston.
Fort William is cold, there is a threat of sleet in the air, and gulls
are wheeling and crying in a blustery wind over Loch Linnhe. In
McTavish's Kitchen, Alan Kirk, restaurateur and head of the local
tourist board, is in a sombre mood.
''The loss of the sleeper and motorail from London will be a big blow
to Lochaber,'' he says. ''Already a lot of our members are getting
cancellations for the summer. It seems absolutely crazy to scrap it just
at the start of the busy tourist season. It's been an important train
for us, and it will be sadly missed here.''
If the West Highlander night train is to pass into the history books,
it deserves at least an epitaph on the departures board at Euston:
''Lochaber No More.''

RANGERS' transfer target Paul Gascoigne has broken his silence on the
Ibrox club's interest and revealed: ''The talks with Rangers' manager
Walter Smith went very well. Now, I realise just how big a club Rangers
are.''
The Gascoigne interview will be shown on Channel 4's Gazzetta Football
Italia this morning at 11am. In it the player reveals that he has talked
about his future with England manager Terry Venables, and that other
clubs are also interested in bringing him back to Britain.
But, clearly, Rangers are in first and have impressed him.
Said Gascoigne: ''It has been difficult for me at Lazio over the past
10 days since the club decided that they were going to sell me.
''That is why they gave me three days off last weekend and didn't ask
me to play against Juventus. It is possible I may not play for them
again because everyone now knows that I'm leaving and we all have to
look to the future.
''It might have been a consideration for me to stay on in Italy with
another club but I don't think Lazio would allow that.
''I have talked to Rangers and I have to say the talks were good. They
were positive. Everything went well.
''But there are other clubs who are interested and I will talk to them
if Lazio agree to that.
''I want to go to a club where the quality of football will be good
and where there is a big stage -- Rangers are very obviously in that
category.
''I have now spoken to Terry Venables and he has always been someone
who has been up front with me. He has assured me that he is not against
my going to Rangers if that is the move I decide to make. All he wants
is to see me happy and settled before the European Championship finals
are played in England next summer. That is very important for Terry and
for me.''
Gascoigne then gave an even bigger hint that Rangers could be the club
he will join.
He pointed out: ''I want to go somewhere I can win medals. I have now
been playing for 10 years as a professional and have nothing to show for
these years.
''I know injuries have kept me out of games but it is still a
disappointment that I don't have league medals or cup medals to show for
these years.
''I want to have them before I stop playing. That has been a miss for
me.''
Gazza could get all the medals he wants at Ibrox if Rangers continue
their domination of the Scottish game. He only has to ask Mark Hateley,
who arrived at Ibrox with an Italian Cup runners-up medal and now has a
fistful to display.
Aston Villa have moved into the frame just as they are fighting
relegation.
I understand they have made a bid and may have matched the one made by
Rangers. However, Villa, with their problems, cannot match Rangers with
their potential to take titles and cups to match Gazza's ambitions.
And, Rangers are already in the European Cup next season.
I understand Smith could have talks with Gascoigne's advisers over the
weekend. Rangers would like to see the deal fixed over the next few
days.
But Gascoigne warns in the interview: ''If there are other clubs to
talk to it may be two weeks before I decide.''

THERE will be much shaking of heads and pleading to the Gods as fans
of three of the bigger clubs in Scotland wake up this morning to the
reality that their beloved team might be close to falling down the
lift-shaft by the time they head back home this evening.
In fact, one of them, Hearts, cannot go down whatever happens, but
they could be destined for the play-off which will be between the team
that finishes second bottom and the side that ends up second-top of the
first division.
That is one of the few certainties that can be cited about the
three-way contest to stay among the elite of the game in this country,
which also involves those two stalwarts of the north-east, Aberdeen and
Dundee United.
Another is that, unlike the other two, Dundee United, cannot avoid at
least a play-off role and even to achieve that they must beat Celtic at
Tannadice and hope that Aberdeen lose to Falkirk at Brockville.
Hearts, who take on Motherwell at home, are best placed in that a
victory guarantees them safety but, as they have lost seven of their
past eight games (the eighth was a fortuitous win over Celtic) they do
not look home and hosed quite yet.
Aberdeen's recent run of good form has taken them from what seemed
certain relegation to a position where, by their own efforts, they can
even escape altogether. A win for them would need a draw or defeat for
Hearts to complete their joy but Falkirk at Brockville, whatever the
cirumstances, are formidable opponents.
In as simple terms as someone whose grasp of these intricacies is as
impressive as his fluency in Serbo-Croat can muster, Hearts will be okay
if they win, Aberdeen will get a second chance, in the play-off, if they
succeed, and Dundee United will need to win first and then wait and see.
Their manager, Billy Kirkwood, has not had the easiest of starts to
his new career but maybe it will get better as from today. He knows
there will be no favours from Celtic with cup final places looming in
the background but adds: ''There is more than that at stake for us and
we have to show it by giving our all. If we get a result and then find
out it hasn't worked for us elsewhere then we will have to accept that
the damage has been done over the season. But we will face that if and
when it happens. Our main concern must be to get a victory.''
United are without suspended key players Billy McKinlay, Gordan
Petric, Brian Welsh, and Dave Bowman. Jerren Nixon and Paddy Connolly
are brought into the pool.
Kirkwood has every sympathy from his peer at Parkhead, Tommy Burns,
who recalled his own feelings as player-manager on the final day last
season when Kilmarnock had to fight to save their skins. He not only
picked the team but played that afternoon and remembers enjoying it. ''I
think these big games, for whatever reason, are times when players need
to take responsibility. What you don't want is to let it pass you by
without doing as well as you know you can.''
He will apply that to the Celtic players this afternoon, even although
they are not by any means as desperate for the points as United. This
afternoon he will expect his team to match the will of the Tannadice
side.
Willie Falconer is suspended, Andy Walker is injured, and Brian O'Neil
is doubtful with a back strain. Simon Donnelly is just about ready to
return after his slight hamstring problem, while John Collins is fit
again after a chest infection.
If Kirkwood at least can be sure that he will be able to try to sort
things out, however things turn out today, his opposite number at
Pittodrie, Roy Aitken, will need to wait until later to discover if his
position will be confirmed.
Should his team win at Brockville, that would surely prove his ability
to motivate a team at its lowest ebb. Aberdeen's plight was so serious
that even the bookies had stopped betting on them being relegated for
the first time in their 92-year history, but Aitken refused to accept
that the fight was futile. He has won admiration from players and
supporters for inspiring a revival that could yet succeed.
He anticipates a tough afternoon at Falkirk, a ''cup-tie'' atmosphere,
but is confident his team will win through. He has to make three changes
because of injuries and suspensions which have ruled out Eoin Jess,
Billy Dodds, Paul Kane, and Peter Hetherston. Former Nottingham Forest
midfield player Ray McKinnon will be recalled.
There will be 7000 Aberdeen fans at Brockville for the finale none of
them expected or even feared.
Much the same could be said of the Hearts fans who will turn up for
their final game against Motherwell at Tynecastle where the added irony
of their manager, Tommy McLean, facing up to his previous team, provides
another of football's many quirks.

* PROMOTER Frank Warren last night said that the possibility of Frank
Bruno fighting for the world heavyweight title in Glasgow is a step
closer.
After last night's big fight weigh-in at the City Chambers where Bruno
scaled 17st 10lb against Mike Evans' 19st 4[1/2]lb, Warren revealed that
he had been invited to Ibrox this afternoon to have lunch with Rangers
chairman David Murray and that he would be raising the subject of a
promotion at the stadium later this year.
Bruno has been promised a shot at WBC champion Oliver McCall if he
overcomes the challenge from Mike Evans tonight and Warren said: ''If
Frank does a decent job on Evans I will be flying out to America on
Monday for talks with McCall's promoter Don King.
''There's a big push to have the world title fight involving Frank
staged in London but Ibrox is an excellent venue and is a frontrunner
with September the probable date.
''On the same bill I would also hope to stage Nigel Benn's next
defence of the WBC super-middleweight championship.''

FRANK Bruno will tonight make his first appearance in a Scottish ring
when he takes on American Mike Evans at the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow, and,
despite all the protestations from promoter Frank Warren that Evans is a
good and worthy opponent, it is most unlikely he will succeed where
other middle-of-the-road opponents have so far failed.
It is a simple fact that Bruno is too strong and too powerful a
puncher for all but the very best in this most testing of sports. The
leading contenders duck out of his way and that leaves the promoter with
a difficult job of trying to fix up suitable opponents.
Bruno's last two victims, Jesse Ferguson and Rodolfo Marin, who lasted
a total of just three minutes and 27 seconds, looked worthy opponents on
paper, but both turned out to be so different on canvas, proving to be
slightly less aggressive than Peter Pan's Tinkerbell. But it is hardly
the fault of a promoter if a fighter decides to fall over.
Evans assures us that he has never lay down for anyone and he won't do
it for Bruno. I believe him, and, having watched a video of him in
action, he looks a pretty useful type. But he will go the same way as so
many before him, although he may last slightly longer.
A Bruno victory would, of course, clinch a fourth world-title fight
for him, against World Boxing Council champion Oliver McCall, and one
man who has no doubts that the Londoner will go all the way this time is
American Linwood Jones, who has been Bruno's main sparring partner at a
Leicestershire training camp.
''Evans is a sturdy fighter who has been looking for the opportunity
to break on to the world scene,'' he said. ''He will be looking to
hustle Frank, but I think Frank will be too strong and force a stoppage
in the middle rounds.'' Other fights on tonight's bill are:
Heavyweight: Scott Welch (Great Yarmouth) v Eduardo Antonio Carranza
(Argentina). Cruiser: Dennis Andries (London) v Terry Dunstan (London).
Middle: Chris Pyatt (Islington) v Anthony Ivory (USA), Cornelius Carr
(Middlesbrough) v Sven Hamer (Margate). Welter: Gordon Blair (Glasgow) v
Kevin McKenzie (Hartlepool). Light-welter: Paul Ryan (Hackney) v Jorge
Ramirez Aqiuno (Dominican Republic). Light: Dave Anderson (Glasgow) v G
G Goddard (Alfreton), Tanveer Ahmed (Glasgow) v John O'Johnson
(Nottingham), Peter Till (Walsall) v Ray Newby (Leicester). Bantam:
James Murray (Cleland) v Danny Ruegg (Bournemouth). Feather: Brian Carr
(Moodiesburn) v Paul Wynn (Gateshead).

THERE'S no doubt about it.
As far as Scottish rugby is concerned, they are The Herald prize guys.
And let's face it, there has been an amazing season in which (mention it
reasonably quietly) England won the Grand Slam at Scotland's expense --
despite the heroic efforts of all of our national squad -- and Stirling
County achieved the league championship after having risen rapidly
through all seven divisions in recent years.
The four recipients of The Herald Rugby Awards last night were (left
to right) Bill Gibson, president of Stirling County (McEwan's 70/- Team
of the Year), Eric Peters (Highland Spring Try of the Year), Gavin
Hastings (Herald Player of the Year), and Graham Dall (Royal Bank Most
Promising Young Player of the Year).
The presentations were made at a ceremony in Edinburgh's Sheraton
Hotel.

THE date is unfortunate for a start, never mind a finish. May 13. And
as far as the title and promotion race are concerned -- and don't
forget, this year, it is in two parts -- the guarantee is that it will
be unlucky for some as the last game approaches.
Three sets of wise men from the East are in contention -- one for
definite premier division football, the others to battle, like the
Aussie soap, home and away. The Fifers from Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline,
and Taysiders, Dundee, who live just down the road from another mob who,
one way and another, might be united in the same league next season, are
the principal players.
A case of dreams of glory, or nightmares in the remaining league
encounter of the season. As in every complicated scenario, that old
''one at a time'' cliche suddenly comes into its own. So we begin with
the men at the top.
Raith Rovers -- three points ahead, the Coca-Cola Cup holders who had
the cheek to penalise Celtic, and thus are now in Europe. Do fairy tales
go on for ever?
Let's go past the midnight hour, and face up to the fact that they
travel to the Maryhill home of the great unpredictables, where now also
are housed Hamilton Accies, safe in the middle of the league, and their
opponents for today.
Accies manager, Iain Munro, is one of those principled characters who
even is willing to miss his team's promised trip to Tenerife, which
begins on Sunday, to appeal against a #200 SFA fine the following day
after he had been reported as having criticised the referee in a match
against Stranraer.
Like his Partick Thistle hosts, Munro admits that Hamilton have had an
up and down season. ''But we've won our last three games, and want to
make it four in a row for the first time this term.''
But Raith have got the psyche. Nine away wins in a row, a night at
Hamilton races to relax on Thursday, followed by preparations at an
Erskine hotel they used before that Ibrox win in the league cup.
Shaun Dennis and player-manager Jimmy Nicholl are available again, and
striker Steve Crawford should recover in time from injury.
Nicholl was candid enough to admit: ''Defeat is unthinkable.'' He has
a point. If Dunfermline and Dundee had to win in that situation, there
would be a wake in the streets of Raith as there team would finish
third.
And so to Dunfermline, superior in goal difference, taking on
Clydebank -- also relaxed at being out of the relegation struggle, and
unpredictable enough to show their undoubted skills under the
circumstances.
On paper, a Dunfermline victory can give them at least a shot at the
second-bottom club in the premier division -- a much better scenario
than the bitter memories of last year when, despite a record year in
points and goals scored, they finished second with only Falkirk
promoted.
Assistant manager Dick Campbell says the same as Nicholl, but adds:
''After the victory we need, we will look to see what has happened
elsewhere.''
And so to Dundee, and player-manager Jim Duffy. Like the other
promotion candidates involved, he has tasted life at the top of the
division this season. A bad set of results recently, not helped by
injuries and suspensions -- although he would be the last to use that as
an excuse -- sees his men travelling the length of the country to face
the already doomed Stranraer.
Goals scored would help Dundee's cause. The statistic state that if
Dundee score eight and Dunfermline only one, then Dens Park would be a
scene of partial delight, and then amazement if they have to play off
against street rivals United. Great fun, isn't it.
Duffy probably summed up the feeling of weary, first-division leaders
when he said: ''All I'm looking for is one goal more than Stranraer.
After that, we'll see what happens.''
A wee added bit of spice is that Stephen McAnespie, son of Stranraer
leader, Alex, plays for Raith Rovers.
In case anyone forgets in the tension, Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie
have a tough trip to face a St Johnstone side who are playing for their
own pride as well as that of manager Paul Sturrock. And Simon Stainrod's
Ayr United go to Paisley to meet Jimmy Bone's St Mirren. There could be
a few future jobs for players on the line at both games.

KENNY Dalglish claims that because he cannot win the English title on
Blackburn's home gound, Anfield will do nicely as a substitute.
Rovers go into the final game of the season with Liverpool this
afternoon knowing victory will give the club their first championship in
81 years. They hold a two-point lead over Manchester United, going to
the last hurdle.
United travel to West Ham with a better goal difference.
The Anfield match will be a poignant one for Blackburn manager
Dalglish, who is still revered in that corner of Merseyside after so
much success, as a manager and player.
''Liverpool have been the role model for 30 years,'' he said. ''If I
had a choice of not winning the title at Blackburn, I would have to
choose Anfield. I lean towards Liverpool for what they did for me and my
family. The fans know how to celebrate, but they also appreciate teams
that play good football.''
Blackburn were only eight minutes away from winning the title on
Wednesday when Denis Irwin scored with a penalty for United against
Southampton. The town's pubs and clubs were packed with fans watching
the drama unfold but Dalglish said: ''I never saw the game.''
He is only too aware, however, that one of the few moments of football
misery he suffered at Anfield came in another head-to-head on the final
day of the 1988-89 season. Michael Thomas gave Arsenal a last-gasp
victory with a strike that stunned the Kop and took the title to
Highbury.
''That was really disappointing,'' said Dalglish, ''although losing to
Wimbledon the year before in the cup final was just as bad. We had 41
games before the Arsenal match to score an extra goal. It was an
achievement to get that close.''
Blackburn are expected to name the side that beat Newcastle on Monday
to keep the pressure on United. Meantime, Andrei Kanchelskis and Roy
Keane have given Manchester United a double boost on the eve of their
biggest week of the season.
Kanchelskis has confirmed he is staying with the club next season,
though he will miss the FA Cup final. But Keane is back for the Wembley
clash with Everton, the Irish midfielder having recovered from injury.
At the other end of the table, Alan Smith remains defiant with his
Crystal Palace side facing a ''mission impossible'' at Newcastle. The
Selhurst Park manager refused to throw in the relegation towel although
a win will be the only result good enough to save Palace -- on a ground
where Newcastle have suffered only one Premiership defeat in 16 months.
Smith still feels he can lead Palace to a great escape in possibly his
final Premiership match in charge.
''We will all go into the Newcastle game believing we can stay up,''
insisted Smith. ''Its going to be a desperate struggle but we don't
accept it's all over.''
Palace, Aston Villa, and Sheffield Wednesday go into today's final
league programme under a Premiership death sentence. A point at home
against relegated Ipswich would be enough for Wednesday, but Palace
could condemn Villa if they won at St Jame's Park and the midlanders
were beaten at Norwich.
Wednesday and Villa could both lose and still survive -- if Palace
fail to win.

THE full gamut of emotions will be felt in Division 2 today, with home
sides experiencing different feelings on this last Saturday of the
season.
The tension among Stirling Albion players and fans will be shared by
their visitors, Dumbarton, as the teams fight it out for the one
promotion place behind Morton. Stirling's victory over Clyde last week
means that the home side need only a draw.
The jubilation of the home lot at Greenock as they acclaim Morton as
champions will be in contrast to the gloom of Jim Leishman's Meadowbank,
who now know that they will move to Livingston as a third-division team.
There will be a sense of relief at Dumfries now that Queen of the
South have guaranteed their survival. However, it is just as well that
Clyde are out of the running for promotion as it would have been too
much for the home support to bear if once again the locals were simply
supplying the opposition for a visiting team to clinch promotion -- as
Montrose did in 1991 and Clyde themselves two years ago.
The disappointment of Stenhousemuir after a season which once held
promise will be felt as they ring down the curtain at home to East Fife
-- and shared by Berwick, as they play a hosts to Brechin.
Division 3 has no issues left unresolved but it will be interesting to
see whether Scotland's top scorer, Mark Yardley, can add to his tally of
five goals against Arbroath already this season when they visit
Cowdenbeath.
An impressive total of 80 points is the incentive for champions Forfar
to beat Alloa, while East Stirlingshire and Ross County may reflect that
their clash at Firs Park could well have been for promtion.
The team that did make it, Montrose, should be too strong at home for
Albion Rovers, whose manager, Jimmy Crease, knows only too well that
money is badly needed for new players.
Assuming that Arbroath fail to win at Cowdenbeath, Queen's Park can
finish in second place if they beat Caley Thistle by two goals at
Inverness, where they won spectacularly on the second Saturday of the
season.

MAYBE it is as well that Rangers go into the last game of a long
season without needing any points, other than as fillip to take away for
the hols. They have now reached the stage where the players may have to
book in advance if they want places in the treatment room.
Their manager, Walter Smith, said yesterday that, of the 51 on the
playing staff, 31 were out of action with various injuries which, even
utilising flawed arithmetic powers, means he has only six players above
what is required for duty in the premier-division game with Partick
Thistle.
As a fair number of them, if not all, do not take much time to shave
in the morning, it means those who can stand up straight will be asked
to finish the season in style. Fortunately, he is able to name an eleven
which contains only one of the younger brigade, although all the
substitutes will be from the youth squad.
The odd one out at the start will be full back Neil Caldwell, a
Rangers Boys' Club recruit, but he is in the unique position of knowing
in advance that he is making his one and only appearance for the first
team. The 19-year-old has been at Ibrox for almost three years. He will
not forget the last day of the '94-95 season, whoever else does.
Twenty-year-old Neil Inglis, will be the substitute goalie, and will
also be allowed to leave the club. But the two other replacements will
be chosen from a trio of younger lads, 18-year-old Ian Nicholson,
18-year-old Paul McKnight, and 17-year-old Paul McShane.
''The youth team won the Youth Cup so we will want to give one or two
of these lads the chance at some stage to show what they can do,'' said
Smith.
It may have taken until the last day of the season, but that makes it
no less an event to be able to announce an Ibrox side (or any other, for
that matter) before the team sheets appear on the day of the game. The
numbers may vary, but the line-up is: Maxwell, Caldwell, McLaren, Moore,
Cleland, Durie, Steven, Durrant, Mikhailichenko, Hateley, and Laudrup.
''We have had to overcome injuries all season,'' said the manager,
''but I think you could say it is now chaotic.''
Smith is not inclined to get involved in the series of Gazza stories
now taking on soap opera status, leaving the matter to rest where it was
when he last spoke -- that the player, his representatives, and Rangers
will get together again when the time comes for more talking to be done.
Partick Thistle will make the short trip across the city in relaxed
mood after having secured their premier future for another season last
week.
Their manager, John Lambie, shows that he already has an eye to next
term by leaving out Steve Pittman and Derek McWilliams, both in line for
suspension if they suffer another booking. ''I don't want to be starting
next season the same way as we had to last year,'' said the manager, who
also decided to drop, and free, another player who could have picked up
a booking and early suspension.
Lambie and the inimitable, but trouble-prone Chic Charnley will part
company again -- on good terms, according to the Thistle chief.
Nothing much will change, whatever the result at Ibrox, but the
Rangers fans will at least be able to indulge in their familiar
celebration ditties again as the League trophy is presented after the
game by Lord Fraser.
There will be no lack of good humour at Rugby Park, either, where
Kilmarnock fans will be delighted to mark the end of a fine season in
which their new manager and new stadium have proved a good match. They
will have a determined Hibs to take on, of course, as the Easter Road
team still like the idea of finishing third in the table, although their
UEFA Cup hopes have disappeared.
Hibs welome back Darren Jackson after suspension but Gordon Hunter
begins his enforced absence, while four players are due fitness tests --
Keith Wright, Mickey Weir, Kevin Harper, and Michael O'Neill.
Two of the Easter Road men have signed new two-year contracts, Gareth
Evans and Jim Leighton. The keeper thus completes a remarkable return to
the forefront, having re-established himself as a Scottish
intenationalist.
* RANGERS continuing injury problems mean that the Old Firm Premier
Reserve League match today against Celtic has been postponed.
After Celtic last night agreed, the Scottish league gave the go-ahead
for the game to be held over until Monday, the final day of the reserve
league season.
The game will be at Cliftonhill, Coatbridge, with a 1.0 kick-off.
Meanwhile, Celtic yesterday were presented with the Youth League
championship trophy before a 1-1 draw with Rangers.
ST MIRREN yesterday handed five players free transfers, including
David Byrne, a recent signing from Partick Thistle.
The others are Jim Gardner and Kenny Gillies, who have both played
regularly in the first team, Scott Harvie and Martin Hick.
And Saints may lose another five first team men, because they are out
of contract. Captain Norrie McWhirter, under-21 cap Jamie Fullarton,
Barry McLaughlin, Alex Bone and goalkeeper Alan Combe have all been
retained, but manager Jimmy Bone admitted: ''I don't have the finance to
offer them a re-signing fee.''

HIGHLAND SPRING
THE Highland Spring Try of the Year Award goes to the Bath and
Scotland No.8 Eric Peters for his barnstorming touchdown against Wales
at Murrayfield. The Peters try, a classic counter-attacking affair, came
top from a short-leet of six screened by BBC Scotland Sportscene Rugby
Special.
It faced stiff competition from the spectacular ''Toonie Flip'' try
scored by Gavin Hastings at Parc des Princes -- a try which assisted
Scotland to their first win in France since 1969 -- but, technically,
with the ball passing through four pairs of hands before Peters appeared
like the 7th Cavalry to perform the coup de grace, the Murrayfield
effort justifiably topped the Rugby Special viewers' poll.
The try was conceived in the deep as the Welsh returned a Craig
Chalmers kick from inside the Scotland half. Rob Wainwright gathered the
ball and handed on to Hastings. The Scottish captain, eschewing the
temptation to kick for touch, had the vision to turn what seemed like
base metal into sparkling gold.
He began the run from the Scottish twenty-two. Doddie Weir was next in
line and the big Melrose man set Kenny Logan off on a scalding foray
which capitalised on Welsh defensive disarray.
Logan, who is one of those favoured few players who set the crowd
buzzing with anticipation whenever he touches the ball, scythed through
Welsh ranks before Peters, who had anticipated the situation to
perfection, and appeared at the Stirling County winger's elbow to set
the seal of perfection on one of the most spectacular tries ever scored
on the Murrayfield stage.
The other tries in the Rugby Special compilation were: Kenny Logan for
Stirling County against Melrose; Fergus Wallace for Scotland A against
South Africa; Derek Stark for Boroughmuir against Watsonians; Chris
Dalgleish for Gala against Melrose; and Gavin Hastings for Scotland
against France.

THE top athletics' coach, Frank Dick, employs a neat phrase to
highlight the gulf which separates sporting winners and losers.
Achievers, he says, are mountain people and those who never quite make
it are to be found down there in the valleys.
Andrew Gavin Hastings, this season's winner of The Herald Player of
the Year Award, can survey the sport which he has graced at
international level for nine years from the highest peak in the land.
Hastings, twice a British Lion, holder of the Scottish record for both
caps and points, and this season an inspirational captain who has led by
example to drag the Scottish side from the dark days of nine games
without a win, has won the hearts and minds of a rugby nation which saw
the national side bounce back from the Wooden Spoon to challenge England
for the Grand Slam.
The bare statistics of 57 caps and 563 points in full internationals
provide just a taste of the Hastings story. The real tale is told out
there on the pitch where Hastings has never given less than his all.
So outrageous has the story often been that this season, in the
aftermath of the victory in Paris where the Scots won for the first time
in 26 years and the captain scored that storybook try, his team-mates
christened him Roy of the Rovers.
With the Rugby World Cup set fair on the horizon -- the Scottish squad
leaves for South Africa on Tuesday -- Hastings is loth to reminisce on a
Scotland career which began against France in 1986, a game in which he
kicked all the points in an 18-17 win.
It matters not that he will retire from the international stage once
the World Cup adventure is over.
''I have been asked what the high-point in my career has been but,
hopefully, that high-point is still to come,'' says Hastings.
''At the moment I'm more interested in looking forward to the World
Cup. This is going to be the most exciting tournament that I have been
involved in.
''I have fond memories of the World Cup at Murrayfield in 1991 and the
1990 Grand Slam leading on to the New Zealand tour. That was the finest
spell of rugby that we have played until this season.
''But this season is still so fresh that it's difficult to concentrate
on what has gone before. Paris this year has to be one of the great
highlights. As a one-off it was fantastic.
''Maybe it won't have the longevity of winning the Grand Slam, but 26
years was a notable achievement. If we can continue from that then the
World Cup can be equally momentous.''
Hastings believes that the current Scottish side is as good as any he
has played with. ''As a set of individuals we are clearly not as good,
but the synergy when we come together as a team, and the blend that we
have achieved, and with the confidence that has built up over the last
few games, we are capable of everything and more than the great teams of
the past have achieved.
On the subject of captaincy, he declares there are no written rules,
no guidebooks to follow. ''Nobody ever sits down and says this is what
makes a good captain. Everything that I have ever done in the captaincy
sense has come from me, from the heart. Everything I do is just me. You
have to be 100% natural.
''I would never ask my team to do anything that I wasn't prepared to
do as well, and when you have relative success, as we have had this
year, you get extra pleasure because you know how hard everybody has
worked for it.''
The pleasure which this season's international campaign has brought is
heightened by the miserable memory of those nine games without a win.
''It is difficult to keep a smile on your face and keep positive when
the team isn't going well,'' he says. ''But records are just records and
I wasn't playing in Argentina and neither were seven or eight other
guys. I'm convinced that if we had been then we would have won both
Tests in Argentina.
''We lost the game against England last season due to a refereeing
decision that I will never agree with in my life. I don't want to make a
big issue of it but I will go to my grave convinced that it cost us the
game.
''We drew with Ireland and lost to France playing poorly and to Wales
playing abominably. I am not making excuses, but I felt that we were not
as bad as our record suggested. All we needed was the rub of the green
and a turnaround would materialise.''
Hastings came in for severe personal criticism during this dark
period. Did he ever contemplate retirement? ''The hardest point was
after the South Africa game. We had performed poorly and I wasn't at my
best, but I still had it in my mind that I wanted to go through to the
World Cup.''
At Murrayfield in 1994, TV viewers across the globe caught a glimpse
of just what it means for Hastings to play for Scotland. Just a couple
of minutes after ''that'' refereeing decision had cost Scotland the
match the captain appeared live on camera and broke down in tears.
''It was just one of these things that happen. I got letters from
people all over the world. I still have them and I replied to them all.
It brought it home to a lot of people, some of whom might have thought
that we didn't care that much, just what playing for Scotland means to
me.
''It was a completely emotional thing. I sat down and I was fine. Then
the questions started coming. You are two minutes out of a game of that
magnitude and you just lose control but I am not embarrassed by it in
any way.''
Hastings has been a rugby superstar for almost a decade -- three World
Cups, two Lions tours, one as captain, as well as a talismanic influence
on his native heath.

SPONSORED BY THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND
GRAHAM Dall, the Heriot's FP and Scotland under-21 flanker, is the
Royal Bank of Scotland Most Promising Young Player of the Year.
Dall, 19, who continues his rugby education as a member of the
Scotland Development Squad tour to Zimbabwe later this month, captained
the under-21 side throughout the season and led the Scottish youngsters
to victory over Wales at Inverleith to record the first Scottish win at
this level since 1986.
A product of George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, Dall also captained
Scottish Schools to a momentous victory over their Australian
counterparts at the North Oval, Sydney, in 1993. However, it is not for
his inspirational captaincy that Dall receives the award which has
previously gone to Gregor Townsend and Craig Joiner, both of whom have
gone on to make their mark on the international stage.
Dall, at 6ft 2ins and 15st, is a dynamic open-side wing-forward who
made his senior debut with Heriot's FP soon after leaving school and who
has made the breakthrough this season to the senior Edinburgh District
side.
A medical student in Edinburgh, he has combined successfully the
competing interests of an onerous study programme with the demands now
made of those who wish to play serious representative rugby.
His talent was spotted at an early age when he played for Scotland
under-15s and, through the ranks of Scottish Schools, under-19s and,
now, with the under-21s -- a category for which he is eligible for
another year -- Dall has led a core of players each with the drive and
ambition to make the senior international side.
''My aims for next year are to remain in the Edinburgh District side
and to play for the Scotland U21s. I've played six times for Edinburgh
this season. I've learned a lot from playing alongside and against guys
like Graham Drummond, Stuart Reid, and Bruce Ward,'' says Dall.
He is delighted to have been included in the Zimbabwe tour party:
''It's a good mix. There are some old heads and young guys like me, Ian
Elliot, and Hugh Gilmour, who, although he has played for Scotland A,
hasn't quite broken through yet.
''It's not a full A side, but the SRU are giving guys like me the
opportunity to play with better players at a higher level. It's an
excellent opportunity and a great step forward by the SRU.''
Dall, whose father Fraser is a former Scotland B cap and director of
coaching at Goldenacre, and whose brother, Andrew, plays in the back row
for Scottish Schools, is not the first player -- and he certainly won't
be the last -- to recognise that rep rugby makes huge demands on time
and commitment. He says: ''I do enough at university to pass, and not a
lot more to be honest, and, similarly with rugby at the moment, I find
that I'm struggling for time.''
International back rows these days are inhabited by skyscraper types
who, not so long ago, would have found berths at lock, but Dall does not
believe his 6ft 2ins should be a deterrent to him pursuing an open-side
slot at the highest level. ''Iain Morrison is about my size and Ian
Smith is actually smaller. I've never actually played against Morrison
but he is a very clever player. I don't think that size is a problem.
I'm athletic enough to get away with it, I think. Also, I believe that
open-side flanker is being regarded, in Scotland at least, more as a
specialist position.''

SCOTTISH rowing's domestic summer season finally gets under way this
weekend with the Aberdeen clubs hosting the North Eastern Regatta on the
River Dee.
With almost 100 races scheduled for each day this weekend the regatta
has attracted its biggest entry for some years. This will be the first
opportunity for many of the Scottish clubs and rowers to see and
appreciate Aberdeen Boat Club's new extended clubhouse -- formally
opened last month by Peter Haining, Scotland's world sculling champion
-- and which will act as headquarters for this weekend's event.
The big entry follows the largest ever Strathclyde International
Regatta held at Strathclyde Park last month but is in sharp contrast to
the cancellation of last weekend's event due to lack of entries -- the
normally popular Castle Semple Regatta.

MICHAEL Schumacher's troubled defence of his Formula One world
championship crown continued yesterday with another simple error.
Trying to snatch provisional pole position for tomorrow's Spanish
Grand Prix in Barcelona with a late surge in his Benetton, the German
spun -- just a day after Britain's Damon Hill remarked that his rival
was feeling the pressure.
Schumacher's error brought back memories of his double mistake at
Imola, where he spun in qualifying and then crashed during the race.
The 26-year-old had to settle for fourth place yesterday as Ferrari
continued their re-emergence.
Frenchman Jean Alesi captured provisional pole with a fastest lap of
1min 23.104sec, 0.354sec quicker than his team-mate, Gerhard Berger.
Scotland's David Coulthard was third fastest -- just behind Berger --
with Hill in fifth place, more than a second adrift of Alesi.
Johnny Herbert was seventh in the other Benetton and Eddie Irvine
eighth in the Jordan-Peugeot, but Nigel Mansell continued to find the
McLaren Mercedes uncompetitive. He was a lowly twelfth.
Martin Brundle has increased the British contingent in Barcelona to
six with his return after a three-race absence, but he could only come
home fifteenth in the Ligier.
Irvine, believing the Circuit de Catalunya is where Jordan can finally
show their potential, briefly held the fastest lap in the early stages
of the session before being overtaken by Herbert.
But the duo were overshadowed once the leading drivers had decided to
enter the fray with the early morning drizzle having made way for warm
sunshine.
Coulthard, having shrugged off the electrical problems that had
affected his practice session, looked on course for the quickest time in
the Williams Renault. ''I thought I was going to get it, but something
happened on the last lap,'' said the 24-year-old Scot.
Team-mate Hill, disappointed with his fifth place, said: ''I am not
very happy with the car. I couldn't find the balance -- all the laps
were very messy. We have a lot of work to do.''

PAUL Radisich set the fastest time in yesterday's official TOCA test
at Silverstone in preparation for tomorrow's seventh and eighth rounds
of the Auto Trader RAC British Touring Car Championship.
The Kiwi star, who has yet to win a BTCC in 1995, ended six hours of
testing just 17 thousandths of a second faster than Rickard Rydell in
leading Volvo 850 and signals a return to form for the Ford team.
Underlining the Mondeo's improvement, Kelvin Burt set the third fastest
time.
Current series leader Alain Menu in the Williams prepared Renault
Laguna, finished the day in seventh spot.
It was poor day for a couple of the former Grand Prix drivers now
contesting Britain's premier championship. Derek Warwick could manage no
better than eighteenth in his Alfa Romeo and David Brabham's day was cut
short by an accident. He was uninjured, but his BMW was badly damaged.
With the first 18 cars all lapping within one second of pace setter
Radisich the scene is set for two more titanic BTCC battles tomorrow. As
the cars are so evenly matched, today's two official qualifying sessions
will be make or break for many of the championship contenders. Official

WHILE almost all around him struggled for a score or just survival
over a rigorous examination in testing conditions, Peter O'Malley
yesterday equalled the St Mellion course record of 65, seven under par,
in the second round of the Benson and Hedges International Open -- at
which point the 29-year-old Australian, on 133, held an eight-stroke
lead.
But Colin Montgomerie and Mark James, playing in the same group,
helped one another along to the extent that with their scores of 71 and
68 for aggregates of 138 and 139 they reduced O'Malley's advantage over
them to five and six strokes respectively and with two more rounds over
the 7054 potentially penal yards he can certainly be overtaken.
O'Malley, in Montgomerie's view, is not afraid of a really low score
-- and he should know, after the sandbagging the Australian gave him in
the 1992 Scottish Open.
That golf is no respecter of achievements is reflected in the careers
of O'Malley and Montgomerie since that epic climax over the King's
Course. The stocky Australian finished 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, -- eagle, birdie,
birdie, birdie, eagle -- to come from five behind and beat the Saltire
Cross-sweatered Scot by two strokes with a 62, still his lowest score.
Subsequently Montgomerie won the next two European Orders of Merit and
five tournaments. O'Malley, on the other hand, ''rather lived off my
Gleneagles victory. I expected too much from it and stayed on in Europe
instead of trying for the US Tour. Until I had three first-10 placings
in Australia last winter I had no more real chances.''
In five previous appearances here he had made the cut only once, his
lowest score was 71, and he failed to break 80 three times. But in a
blustery and biting wind and in halves of 32-33 O'Malley made nine
birdies, just reward for keeping the ball in play from the tee and
backing up that essential with accurate iron play and solid holing out.
Montgomerie was eight strokes adrift of O'Malley after only five
holes, three of which he bogeyed, but he was to drop only one more
stroke, at the fifteenth where his approach plugged in a bunker. Having
birdied the long second he also plundered the three other par-5s and the
short fourteenth for his other gains was particularly firm.
By recovering from a bunker to eight feet at the long sixteenth and
rescuing par from four feet at the next and from 12 feet past the home
hole, Montgomerie gained three strokes on James who missed the last two
greens in regulation and then, with the long-handled putter he is using
for the sixth tournament, saving putts of four and eight feet.
Sam Torrance made six birdies but still had a struggle for his 73 and
despite scores of 77 Sandy Lyle and Gordon Brand Jr survived by a stroke
along with Adam Hunter, Andrew Coltart, whose 73 was an improvement, and
Stephen McAllister. But the two amateurs, Stephen Gallacher and Gordon
Sherry, failed, as did Mike Miller, Gary Orr, Brian Barnes, Dean
Robertson, and Paul Lawrie.

ERNIE Els returned a nine-under-par 61, the equal lowest score of his
career, to take a share of the lead after in the second round at the
Byron Nelson Classic in Dallas, Texas, yesterday.
Els had nine birdies in ideal conditions over the Cottonwood Valley
course to post a 10-under, 130, halfway total. He was tied with American
Robin Freeman, who had his second successive 65.
Nick Faldo led the European challenge, six strokes behind after 14
holes on the Las Colinas TPC course, the tougher of the two layouts used
for the event.
Els made three birdies on the outward half before storming home with
six more, finishing in style by sinking a 35-footer at the last.
Faldo, meanwhile, was producing a typically steady performance as he
gathered two birdies and two bogeys in 14 holes.
The three-time Open and two-time Masters champion, as with Els, also
has just finished a three-week rest. Leading scores (US unless stated):
130 -- R Freeman 65, 65; E Els (S Africa) 69, 61.
131 -- K Perry 65, 66; D Martin 65, 66.
133 -- M Heinen 67, 66; T Sills 67, 66.
Other scores included:

144 -- S Keppler (England) 73, 71.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE openers Tony Wright and Dean Hodgson went on a
run-rampage at Bristol yesterday to shatter a county record that has
stood for 27 years.
Wright hit a career-best 193 and Hodgson 148 in an opening stand of
361 -- passing Gloucester's previous best Britannic Assurance County
Championship first-wicket partnership by 46 runs -- to make up time on
the second day of the clash with Nottinghamshire. The first day had been
a washout.
Hodgson was first out after hitting fifteen 4s while former captain
Wright hammered four 6s and seventeen 4s as Gloucestershire finished on
388 for three.
Umpires Roy Palmer and Peter Wight refused to condemn the Chesterfield
wicket as batsmen continued to bite the dust in the encounter between
Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Bad weather ended the second day 20 minutes
after lunch, with Yorkshire's second innings on 90 for eight -- a lead
of just 127 runs. That means 26 wickets have already fallen in the
match.
A calf strain failed to stop Neil Fairbrother racing to the the
thirty-second century of his career as Lancashire moved into a
commanding position against champions Warwickshire at Old Trafford. The
31-year-old left hander hit eighteen 4s in his 129, but was forced to
use three runners after injury struck with his score on 26.
Fairbrother, dropped by Neil Smith after scoring just five, teamed up
with new Lancashire skipper Mike Watkinson (91) for a fifth-wicket stand
worth 136 as the home side closed on 352 for seven -- a lead of 90.
Alec Stewart was dropped twice on his way to an unbeaten 147 that
steered Surrey into a commanding position against Durham at The Oval.
They closed on 288 for one -- a lead of 17. Mark Butcher is 89 not out.
South African Test captain Hansie Cronje hit his first championship
century to give Leicestershire hope of saving their match against Kent
at Canterbury. He hit an unbeaten 120 as Leicestershire, needing 426 to
avoid the follow-on in reply to Kent's mammoth 575, reached 227 for four
off 55 overs.
At Northampton, Marcus Trescothick hit fourteen 4s in a fluent
unbeaten 83 as Somerset built up a 68-run lead over the home county.

VALERIE Michaud moved a stroke clear of the pack after the second
round of the Costa Azul Open in Portugal.
The French golfer, a former British amateur champion, shot a second
consecutive round of 69 over the Montado course where today's final
round will be played.
This left Michaud at six under par on 138, just in front of
Marie-Laure de Lorenzi, who shares second place with Australian Corinne
Dibnah.
But it was a disappointing day for Scotland's Kathryn Marshall. An
opening round of 69 promised much but yesterday she never caught alight.
She slipped back with a round of 76, dropping four strokes in her last
11 holes.
Michaud won a pro-am in Geneva last week and a pro tournament in
France the previous week. ''It was a good start to the season and I feel
that I am in good form.'' she explained.
138 -- V Michaud (France) 69, 69.
139 -- C Dibnah (Australia) 67, 72; M-L de Lorenzi (France) 72, 67.
140 -- L Fairclough 73, 67; E Orley (Switzerland) 68, 72.

THE European Tour will break more new ground next year -- by going to
Australia. It has been announced that the Heineken Classic in Perth
will, on a three-year trial basis, become part of the Australasian and
European circuits in 1996.
Already this year Europe's golfers have been to Dubai in the Middle
East, the Philippines, and South Africa for tournaments which have
counted towards the Ryder Cup.
The Heineken Classic will follow on from the Johnnie Walker Classic in
Singapore at the start of next season, and Brian Allen, executive
director of the Australasian PGA Tour, said: ''They are close together
physically and it made sense to have shared events.''

THE Belgium women's hockey team must be sick of the sight of Scotland.
The teams met for the third time in the space of seven days in Cardiff
yesterday, and the Scots again took the honours.
They maintained their maximum record by registering a 5-0 victory to
go immediately to the top of the Four Nations table, ahead of Wales and
Ireland who surprisingly drew 1-1.
Susan MacDonald, the Western striker, again was the star of Scotland's
triumph, scoring three of her side's goals to bring her tally for her
last three internationals to six.
With marksmanship of this calibre, it was little wonder the Belgians
were swept away in the first half with MacDonald netting a hat trick in
the space of just 16 minutes, starting in the thirteenth.
MacDonald, who is renowned for her poaching qualities, also hit the
target this time from setpieces, converting both a penalty and a corner.
Belgium, to their credit, worked tirelessly to produce a meaningful
contest, but they had neither the experience nor the expertise to
disrupt the pattern of the game and in the second half Scotland put a
true reflection on the scoreline with two further goals.
The first in 52 minutes proved a first for Susan Gilmour in her eighth
senior international. Then a corner conversion by Susan Fraser put the
finishing touches to a superb Scottish performance.
Today in the second series of games Scotland play Ireland.

US Open champion Ernie Els shot a flawless nine-under-par 61,
equalling the lowest score of his career, to tie for the lead after the
second round at the $1.3m Byron Nelson Classic in Dallas, Texas,
yesterday.
Els compiled nine birdies in ideal morning conditions for a course
record at Cottonwood Valley, the easier of the two courses used for the
event. He is tied with American Robin Freeman, who shot 65 at Cottonwood
Valley, one ahead of two other Americans, Kenny Perry and Doug Martin.
John Daly is three behind after a 65, while Nick Faldo trails by seven
-- he had three bogeys in four holes from the fourteenth at the Las
Colinas TPC course, before a birdie at the last for a 71.
Els matched the 61 he shot on his way to victory at last year's Dubai
Desert Classic. The laid-back, long-hitting 25-year-old said: ''I felt
good about my swing and the hole looked like a bucket.''
The cut was made at one-under 139. Leading scores (Americans unless
stated):
130 -- Robin Freeman 65, 65; Ernie Els (S Africa) 69, 61.
131 -- Kenny Perry 65, 66; Doug Martin 65, 66.

67, 66.
European scores: 134 -- Jesper Parnevik (Sweden) 68, 66. 137 -- Nick

MAYBE deep in the recesses of their minds, the parents of Pierre van
Hooydonk envisaged an international, European career for their
first-born, otherwise they may have chosen a different Christian name.
In a sense they have been proved right, although it may have been more
appropriate to have gone for a Celtic moniker, something like Hamish,
even if Hamish van Hooydonk does not quite have the same ring.
According to the man himself, they just liked the name but he does
admit if he had landed in France, rather than Scotland, it might have
been a touch embarrassing if the locals had assumed he was au fait with
le francais.
He is not too bad at le English and is getting better. He will need to
keep improving because he does confess that the dressing-room wags leave
him mystified when they move into top speed. He had to have explained
the nickname that has been bestowed upon him by the Parkhead players. He
is known as ''Huggy'' after the streetwise informer from Starsky and
Hutch.
He seems quite happy with it but knows, like all footballers, that
when they saddle you with an alias your are stuck with it.
All of which might indicate that this amiable big lad has settled into
the Scottish way of life smoothly enough.
He does seem to have inherited his father's Europeanism. Dad runs a
haulage business in Holland which goes well beyond the borders of his
own country.
Pierre, who is not at all shy, has a pragmatism which dictates that
you go where you need to go to achieve your aims.
''I had no worries about coming to Scotland,'' he said. ''All that was
said was that the weather is not good. But it has not been so bad,
although they tell me we have had our summer.''
The reason he had no hesitation in saying yes to Celtic when they made
their move to bring him here in January was simple enough. Van Hooydonk
had made a clear decision in his own mind before the Parkhead club
appeared on the scene.
''I had made up my mind that whichever big team came in for me I was
going there. Fortunately, it was Celtic and I have no regrets at all
about agreeing to come.''
Pierre's ambition to join what he calls a big club was driving him as
powerfully as the original ambition to become a professionbal
footballer. In each case there were moments when he thought he would not
succeed.
As a youngster growing up in Steenbergen, he did little else but
practice football . . . ''I was not a natural talent, I had to work hard
at it'' . . . but his dream of becoming a professional seemed to be
dashed when he returned home a somewhat disillusioned 15-year-old after
three years with the youth team of NAC Breda, based 45 kilometres from
his home.
He thought then: ''That's it. It is finished now.''
He returned to play for amateur side Steenbergen, eventually reaching
first-team status and becoming their top scorer. A few scouts from RVC
Rosendaal saw him a few times and he was not slow to agree to move.
''I was 18 and knew you didn't often get a second chance to become a
player with a professional club,'' he said.
He is honest enough to admit that he had a hard time in the beginning.
''I was not strong enough. There's a big difference between the amateur
league and the first division. I had to work many hours in the gym. It
was necessary.''
He spent two years with Rosendaal, winning his regular first-team
place in his second season when he scored 27 goals. Then Breda, who had
let him go home some years earlier, paid #70,000 for him, although two
other clubs were also keen to sign him.
He was three-and-a-half seasons with Breda when the next stage of his
game-plan was reached. There had been regular rumours about clubs
wanting to take him from Breda but after hearing of Celtic's interest he
did not hesitate when the talks developed.
''I enjoyed Breda. I scored 29 goals in my last season in the Premier
League but after I heard of Celtic's interest, I scored 10 league goals
and three cup goals before I was transferred.''
He knew all about Celtic and their past, being an avid reader and TV
football watcher, and was aware of the reputation the current game in
Scotland has. He has not been surprised at what he has discovered,
therefore, and has his own theory about the game as it is played in this
country.
''The first difference, I think, is that you can go much closer to the
borderline between a foul and a fair tackle here.
''The referees in Holland would blow the whistle and stop many of the
tackles that are allowed here. The result is that the game is faster
here because there are fewer stoppages.
''You have to change to play the same way but not go over the line.
''I have talked a lot with people here about the different ways the
game is played, especially the two contrasts in Holland and Scotland.
People here want it changed a little bit, to more European style but you
can't change it 180 degrees. That is impossible.
''Everybody likes the way Brian Laudrup is playing for Rangers which
says enough about what they like.'' Van Hooydonk accepts that fans here
expected to see a tall man with his strength in the air when he came to
Celtic but he insists he has always been better on the ground. ''The
game is played on the ground, otherwise the ball would have wings.''
He has not been entirely satisfied with his play for Celtic but
believes that has much to do with his not quite achieving the level of
fitness he thinks is required.
''I have done a lot of travelling between here and Holland and I have
had an injury as well. For sure, I will be a better player for next
season.'' The cup final on May 27 beckons to him like a major milestone
in his career but first of all, he maintains, the task is to win a
trophy for Celtic. ''For the fans it is a big thing to win after six
years without a trophy. That is most important but for me personally it
would be special, too.
''I came here on January 12 and was part of the cup run from the first
minute to the last so, if we win the cup, I can say I was part of the
team to win a trophy for the first time in six years.''
He has no doubts about the final being his biggest footballing
occasion to date. He does not forget his two international caps but
points out that one was a friendly and in the other he came on as a
substitute against Luxembourg.
''That was important for me but this is very big day.'' He has been
happy with the way the Parkhead fans have taken to him. ''It is always
nice to hear if supporters respect the way you play.''
He has settled happily in Scotland and hopes to move to a new house
soon. Pierre had a girlfriend of short duration before he came to this
country but is no longer attached even to that degree.
His English improves by the minute and he hopes one day to be the
''big mouth'' he claims he was in Holland, both in the dressing-room and
at school.
''I would say black was white at school. I talk all the time. At
Celtic, I would give the prize to Granty.''
His own football hero, not surprisingly, was Ruud Gullit, whom he met
twice, once as a 14-year-old when he posed with the great man for a
picture in a sports shop as a prize for buying the tracksuit he
favoured. He still has the picture. The other time was when he was with
the Dutch under-21 side and Gullit played against them in a practice
match.
He expects his family to be present at Hampden on May 27, including
younger brother Johan, who plays for a pub team (''They are called that
in Holland'') and many friends.
It is no surprise to hear that ''Huggy'' has made a few more in his
short time in Scotland.

THE Scottish Claymores have another chance to bid for a place in the
World Bowl when their dreadful World League 1-4 standing is wiped clean
this weekend.
The second half of the Claymores' season kicks off in Dusseldorf today
when the Scots take on Rhein Fire, the team which beat them 19-17 at
Murrayfield in week No.1.
Amsterdam's Admirals have already clinched a World Bowl berth by
winning the first half of the season with a 5-0 record, which included a
31-0 drubbing of the Claymores three weeks ago.
The team with the best record after the next five games will face the
Admirals in the European championship final, to be held during the third
weekend in June.
The World League has still to reach a decision on the venue for the
World Bowl, which was scheduled to take place at the stadium of the
first-half winners, because the Admirals, who play in Amsterdam's
Olympic Stadium, have a scheduling difficulty, the dates clashing with
an athletics meeting.
Regardless of the venue, the Claymores face an uphill struggle if they
hope to meet the Admirals in the Bowl game. The Scots will have to win
all five of their games to stand a realistic chance of getting to the
final, due to the fact that if two or more teams have the same record at
the end of the second half, the overall standing will be taken into
account and the best the Claymores can hope for in that eventuality is a
6-4 standing.
The Scots also will have to overcome injury and personnel problems
which have plagued the side since the defeat by Rhein Fire.
Jim Criner, the head coach, has had to battle against a shortage of
replacement offensive linemen due to problems with the immigration
authorities. Red tape has meant any new players the coach wants to ship
out from the United States to replace injured men have to wait up to a
month before they are granted work permits.
That situation was worsened when tackle, Andre Hewitt, who came in to
alleviate the shortfall, was himself injured in the loss to Amsterdam.
It is a crucial match for the Claymores, who need to win to restore
their confidence and get the ball rolling for a shot at the World Bowl,
but they will have to stop a Rhein Fire team much improved from week
No.1 but also looking for a win after a disappointing loss to the
Admirals last week.
The Scots will have to stop the Germans high-powered offence, ranked
third in the World League. Fire's attack is led by quarterback Gino
Torretta, but running-back Shambe Wright-Fair, is as much a threat
catching the ball, with 27 receptions this season, as he is running it.
Wright-Fair combined both skills to gain a total of 378 yards on
offence in the first half of the season, making him one of the league's
most potent offensive weapons.
The Claymores offence will have to start firing. They have the
league's bottom-rated attack, due mainly to their ineffective passing
game, which will have to start working through quarterbacks Matt Blundin
and Lee Williamson and receivers Tim Barnett and Allen DeGraffenreid if
the Claymores are to have any hope. World League Standings:

THE old guard of Scottish sprinting may be hard pressed to defend
their reputations this weekend at the district athletics championships.
The retirement of Elliot Bunnney, Scotland's leading 100 metres runner
of the past decade with a record six senior outdoor titles, seemed to
clear the way for fellow former European junior champion Jamie Henderson
to don his mantle.
Instead, the 26-year-old Henderson, reigning national 100m champion,
has two young pretenders snapping at his heels. Doug Walker and Ian
Mackie broke through to Commonwealth status last year, and have built on
that.
Walker, who has already clocked a lifetime best of 20.53, in winning
the British Student 200m title last weekend, is down to race the 100m
today against Henderson in the East championships at Grangemouth. Walker
faces Mackie, Britain's leading junior last year, over 200m tomorrow.
In the West championships at Wishaw, seven-times Scottish champion
Brian Whittle faces the prodigious 17-year-old Ross Baillie, who already
has the Scottish under-20 hurdles record to his credit.
Whittle, recently returned from warm weather training, is due to
contest both the 100 and 200m, but dare not ease up.
The presence of Aileen McGillivary and Sinead Dudgeon in the East
sprints makes for keen rivalry. McGillvary, who contested the World
indoor event during the winter, has recovered from a hamstring injury,
but confined herself to just relays at last weekend's UK league match.
Glen Stewart, reigning West 800 and 1500m champion, may confine
himself to the longer event today. He is hoping for some opposition to
push him, already having clocked 3-48 this summer. The West 5000m has
been switched to today, in order to give competitors the option of
running in tomorrow's Scottish 10,000m road race championships at
Cumbernauld (1.0pm).
Dave Allan, the international hammer thrower from Inverness, has made
his best start ever to a season, and hopes to break the 60m barrier
tomorrow in the North championships at Inverness where fellow
internationalists Dave Barnetson and Mel Fowler look certain to add to
their catalogue of titles.

SPONSORED BY McEWAN'S 70/-
IT was the stuff that dreams are made of. They said it could never
happen but it did and more than that, big Stewart Hamilton was lost for
words.
On a February afternoon Stirling County, the wee club which began at
the bottom of the leagues, had reached the pinnacle and were crowned
champions of Scotland. When the genial captain was asked for his
reaction by the man from the telly, his reaction was a classic: ''I
can't say anything, I'll give you a phone tomorrow.''
Last night the accolades continued as County joined the most
prestigious names in the game as they were named McEwan's 70/- Team of
the Year at The Herald rugby awards dinner in Edinburgh.
The huge smile was still on the face of Hamilton last night and there
is a feeling it will be a permanent fixture.
Ascaptainheisduealargeshareofthecreditforthechampionshipseason,butasusualheisful
lofpraiseofother people who have played a part
in the Bridgehaugh club's annus mirabilis.
He also is frank about just how much of a surprise the whole thing has
been to a team which began last season with one aim --
to secure its place in the top flight of the revamped league system.
Hamilton says: ''When we met for the early training last summer the best
we were hoping for was a better show than the
mid-table showing of the previous season. We had suffered like GHK did this
season with a great start then a slump, and we were
worried about a repeat of that.
''When we struggled a bit up at Dundee in the second game, we thought it
was going to be hard season but just kept plugging
away and worked a bit harder at training. Things began to get better.''
After that break came Stirling's only defeat of the season -- against
Hawick at Mansfield Park -- and the spectre of a slump
again appeared. The captain adds: ''We knew that the work-rate had to be
stepped up and we worked on fitness. Everyone responded
and the commitment was tremendous.''
''Hammy'' is delighted with their success but, as you would expect, no
great respecter of reputations. He says: ''These guys
have brought a tremendous amount back to the club from the international
squad sessions and the like. No-one has come on more
than Kenny Logan. He used to be Stirling's answer to Forrest Gump, but what
a change in a guy in a couple of years.''
The skipper, with a fortieth birthday on the horizon but remaining
something of a secret, intends to carry on for as long as
he can.
He is unstinting in his praise for the coaching team of Brian Edwards and
Muff Scobie, but reserves a special mention for
Scotland coach Richie Dixon who, whisper it, still makes the occasional
visit to Bridgehaugh on training nights.
''The training has been great and we were lucky enough to get the
facilities at Stirling University and help from athletics
coach Drew Hyslop for indoor work when the weather turned bad in the middle
of the winter. That helped everyone in their fitness
and I even got my time for the 100 metres below 12 for the first time,'' he
says. The big man would not be drawn on whether that
figure refers to seconds or minutes.
From promotion to Division Six in 1977, the rise continued with Division
Five status in 1978, a further step-up the following
year and Division Three in 1980. Re-organisation put County in the new
Division Two in 1984 then the final step to the top
flight in 1989.
The rest, as they say, is history.

THE British Chambers of Commerce discovered last week what most of us
already knew: anyone who books a leading politician as the star turn at
a conference dinner is more than likely to end up disappointed.
The BCC had asked Michael Heseltine to be the guest speaker on the
first night of its three-day annual conference, held this year in
Aberdeen. He pulled out to go on a trade mission to China.
Michael Portillo agreed to take his place, but also cancelled -- on
the very day -- because of that evening's crucial Commons vote on London
hospitals. ''It find it inconceivable that the debate in the House is
more important than being here tonight,'' said a frustrated BCC
president, Robin Geldard.
Well, Mr Geldard has learned the hard way that votes are considerably
more important to politicians than the business community. Over the
years conference organisers have come to appreciate that if you invite a
Cabinet Minister to address your event, there is a very strong chance of
being dumped in favour of something really important.
The only exception to that rule is if you hold your dinner on a Friday
night, when Ministers are free to fan out across the country, ready and
willing to deliver the good words churned out by their speech writers.
The really unforgivable thing about political let-downs is that they
always come on the day, and often the very afternoon, via a hurried
phone call from a harassed private secretary -- far too late to find a
replacement.
I have attended numerous dinners over the years where the main speaker
was supposed to be the Secretary of State for Scotland, only it wasn't.
In place of Malcolm Rifkind or Ian Lang stood some hapless underling
such as Allan Stewart, Lord Fraser or Peter Mackay, parachuted in to
read their master's words.
Frankly, I fail to understand why organisations persist in inviting
politicians to speak at their important events. Quite apart from
inherent unreliability the breed tends to score low on quality and
originality. I have heard the last two Prime Ministers and any number of
Cabinet Ministers droning on at quite important dinners, oblivious of
whether they were in Glasgow or Gloucester. They invariably arrive late
and leave early. It is unprofessional and unnecessary.
Business conferences are a growth market and consequently the
competition for bums on paid seats is strong. A genuine star attraction
is essential to boost a lacklustre programme and assist ticket sales. It
also helps if the star actually turns up.
For my money the only relevant speakers at a business conference are
those who can, in the current jargon, ''add value'' for their audience.
They must have a track record of achievement, preferably in building
successful companies, and be able to command respect from senior people.
Unless delegates depart with new knowledge, insights or contacts, they
have wasted their money and, more important, their time.
In part this accounts for the astonishing growth of the management
guru and the even more astonishing fees these people are able to charge.
Whether it is John Harvey-Jones at #12,000, ''Maverick'' Riccardo Semler
for #35,000 or Tom Peters for #50,000 (that's right, these are their
daily rates), professionals such as these have a reputation and a
delivery calculated to lift and motivate the listener.
I do wonder whether such gurus will be with us in another 10 years.
Increasingly, I suspect that company directors and managers want to hear
from those who have actually done it (build a successful business, that
is) rather than those who have merely written and lectured about it.
But the man who is the unchallenged representative of enterprise in
the UK, and who could name his own price were he to go on the speaking
circuit, is the last person likely to do so -- Richard Branson. Our best
role model by a mile, he staunchly refuses to accept the multitude of
speaking engagements he is offered.
''I'm terribly afraid that if I did agree then something would come up
and I would have to let you down,'' he once explained to me in a
charming letter that has probably gone to thousands of other worshippers
at the Branson court.
All I will say is that a particularly determined approach is currently
being made to Mr B to speak at a forthcoming event for Scottish
entrepreneurs. If he turns us down then we'll probably just have to go
for Michael Portillo.

CHAMPION jump jockey Richard Dunwoody yesterday successful appealed
against a two-day suspension imposed at Haydock last Saturday.
The rider had been banned for using his whip with unreasonable
frequency on Moving Out, winner of a handicap hurdle.
In overturning the ban the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee
considered evidence from Dunwoody and from a steward of the meeting.
The committee found Dunwoody not guilty. ''This was an exceptional

CONFUSION reigned at Carlisle yesterday when the judge announced the
wrong result and failed to spot his mistake until it was too late to
change it for betting purposes.
After a photo-finish to the Irving Limited Stakes, judge Alistair
Stewart announced that Followmegirls had finished third with Christian
Flight a short head back in fourth.
However, after the weigh-in Stewart noticed he had made an error and
informed the stewards who revised the placings.
The stewards were notified within the time limit laid down under the
rules and confirmed the revised placings.
But bets are settled when the weighed-in signal is given so each-way
bets on Christian Flight are losers.
Stewart said: ''It was an error and was pointed out to me after the
weigh-in was announced.''
Christian Flight's trainer Steve Gollings said: ''I'm pleased she's
got third as she ran a cracking race.''

WHEN the people from Suntory suggested I visit a Japanese distillery,
I realised that, despite years of pottering around the edges of the
Scotch whisky industry, recording its economic ups and downs, sampling
its varied product, I had no real sense of what to expect from a
distillery on the other side of the world.
In the early eighties, when rows about the bulk export of Scotch malt
to Japan were at their height, the critics' core case was simple. We
were selling our birthright by exporting Scotch in bulk. Japanese whisky
was so inferior they depended on those bulk supplies to make it
drinkable. If they wanted our national drink they should be made to buy
it in the bottle.
The case against bulk exports was, I recall, summed up in a hostile
report from the Scottish Council, which had our own distillers, or
rather those covertly participating in the trade, on the run for a
while. Behind the numbers and the dire warnings was a complacent
rhetoric which, like dismissive British attitudes to the first imported
Japanese cars, suggested they would never be able to make whisky (or
cars) the way we could.
We now know better about cars. No-one calls them rust buckets any
more. So what would I find 15 years later at our chosen destination,
Hakushu Distillery, nestling some 150 miles from central Tokyo in what
the Japanese call their Southern Alps?
In slanting rain we headed west on the expressway, leaving the
metropolitan buzz of Tokyo behind. Hakushu lies in mountain foothills in
Yamanashi prefecture, one of only two landlocked administrative regions
of Japan.
We entered Yamanashi through the five kilometre Sasago Tunnel. In a
country where most of the 125 million people are crammed on to 20% of
the land mass, entering Yamanashi, with a total population of 800,000,
is like leaving Perth behind, heading north on the A9. This is Japan's
main grape growing area. As we sped on the landscape was increasingly
dotted with peach tree plantations in glorious bloom.
In written characters, my interpreter told me, Yamanashi is expressed
by two symbols. One means mountains. The other represents those peach
trees. But the character for peach tree is very similar to that for the
word no. ''So people joke about Yamanashi being the 'no mountain'
prefecture,'' she confided.
We left the motorway and travelled down a twisting hillside road into
a mountain-locked valley studded with agricultural hamlets. Grapes,
peaches, pears, chestnuts, bitter Japanese plums, persimmons. All these
and more are cultivated here.
Within minutes the car was at Hakushu. In the same way that many
Scotch whisky distilleries manage to marry their productive function
harmoniously with the environment in which they are set, Hakushu turned
out, for me, to be another little bit of paradise. Seen from the air,
the 33 warehouses stud the wooded landscape. But from ground-level their
screened presence is muted.
The main reception room looks out on to uninterrupted forest which is
home to some 70 species of birds. For anyone interested in birds and
whisky, paradise indeed. No wonder the distillery and the on-site whisky
museum attract some 180,000 visitors a year.
We were shown round by Dr Masaharu Minabe, the production and quality
control manager. He spent nearly three years in Scotland, studying for
his doctorate at Heriot-Watt's International Centre for Brewing and
Distilling. In his time here he visited some 70 Scotch distilleries. His
is, self-confessedly, a love affair with both Scotch and Japanese
whisky.
The distillery he proudly showed us is, in fact, two sharing a single
site. The first was opened in 1973, then doubled in capacity in 1976.
The second was added in 1981. Total capacity is awesome -- some 30
million litres of alcohol. ''Possibly the largest distilling capacity
anywhere in the world,'' announced our host.
The Hakushu site was chosen, primarily, for its water source. And for
the fact that the area is never likely to be developed for residential
purposes. Suntory's other distillery, Yamazaki, was built in 1923 and is
today hemmed in by suburban development between Kyoto and Osaka.
There are 36 stills at Hakushu, 24 in the original distillery, 12 in
Hakashu Higashi (Hakushu East). Many were fabricated by McMillan, the
East Lothian coppersmith. That's only the beginning of the Scottish
connection. Minabe told me Hakushu sources peat from north of Inverness
and buys grain from Scotland too.
''Recently we've been trying to purchase yeast from overseas,
including Britain. Everything is so outrageously expensive in Japan
these days,'' he continued. The point is not to produce a counterfeit
Scotch 6000 miles from Speyside. ''We don't have any regulation or
definition of what Japanese whisky should be. So our president has laid
down that the way we make our whisky should fulfil the same high
standards Scotch meets in your country,'' he explained.
Suntory's Scottish links go right back to the early decades of this
century. The founder of what is still a family controlled business,
Shinjiro Torii, consulted experts at Glasgow University about distilling
techniques when Yamazaki was first opened in the twenties.
And, of course, today Suntory -- with 1994 sales of 733bn yen (#5500m)
from spirits, beer, wine, non-alcoholic beverages, food, pharmaceuticals
and a range of leisure, sports and entertainment interests -- is now the
outright owner of Morrison Bowmore, the Glasgow-based Scotch whisky
distiller which owns the Bowmore, Auchentoshan and Glengarioch
distilleries. It also holds a significant minority stake in Macallan.
I asked Minabe about those old disputes over bulk malt exports to
Japan. ''There are perhaps 10 malt and grain distilleries in the whole
of Japan owned by four different companies,'' he replied. ''And there is
no tradition here of collaborating with your rivals, swapping fillings.
So we had to import to improve the range of whiskies we could use in a
blend.''
By far the bigger issue now, for Japanese whisky and imported Scotch,
is the shrinking market for both drinks in Japan. Hakushu is currently
producing at around 10% of capacity. Hakushu may have 800,000 casks of
whisky in various stages of maturation in vast computer controlled
warehouses, where robot handling devices move the product, but the
marketing challenge (like that facing the Scotch whisky industry) is
encouraging future generations to acquire a taste for the stuff.
''Our baby boomer generation are the main consumers of whisky in
Japan,'' said Minabe. ''But our baby boomers' children are now in their
twenties and they don't drink whisky at all. They mainly drink shochu,
which is a kind of vodka. Shochu producers claim it's not like vodka,
but that's a lie. You can't tell shochu from vodka. Our younger
generation mainly drink it mixed with lemon squash or oolong tea.''
Now shochu -- and the favourable tax treatment accorded it by the
Japanese government -- is a prime target for the Scotch Whisky
Association. The European Union is limbering up for a fresh challenge on
the issue to the World Trade Organisation. Since both Japanese and
Scotch whisky suffer equally from the current tax regime, Suntory
executives are right behind that pressure. But they are also trying to
do creative marketing things to woo younger drinkers from shochu to
whiskies, whether Japanese or Scotch.
Back in Tokyo we sampled a series of Suntory-owned or franchised
outlets which are trying to crack current Japanese drinking trends.
There was the cheap and cheerful bar in Asakasa, with minimal decor,
simple food and drink at affordable prices. Then there was a
thirties-style bar, echoing a Japanese Art Deco style. Again cheap food
and drink on the menu.
From there we moved to a so-called two-crop establishment. During the
day it sells coffee and pastries. In the evening the emphasis shifts to
alcohol and cafe-style food. Lastly we dropped into a more elegant bar
aimed at a middle ranking business clientele. An adult atmosphere. Good
whiskies on the gantry. And reasonally-priced food on the menu.
In each format, whisky is winning a respectable share of bar orders.
When Suntory develops a successful format, it will grow the number of
outlets to spread the impact. Such marketing initiatives are every bit
as important as pressure for tax harmonisation in maintaining whisky's
appeal.
Back at Hakushu, Minabe pressed a small bottle into my hand. ''My
sweat and blood. Everything I know about whisky has gone into that,'' he
smiled. It won't smell of peach blossom, I'm sure. But when I finally
pull the cork, I don't expect to be disappointed by the taste inside.

FARMERS may currently be enjoying higher incomes supported by European
aid schemes but in real terms they are probably working at record low
prices, a member of the Ayr executive of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland claimed at their May meeting.
William Caldwell suggested that the effects of devaluation of the
pound, which increasing the value of cash payments to farmers under the
various support schemes, masked the true situation. ''Are we not in
danger of becoming complacent?'' he asked.
Beef specialist Alan Parker suggested that if farmers looked at their
businesses with support prices taken out of the equation they would be
troubled. ''We may be lulled into a false sense of well-being,'' he
said.
If support levels were diminished and farmers had to depend more on
the prices paid for their products they would not be very happy about
it.
John Scott, president of the area executive, reassured members that
there was no suggestion that support levels were to be diminished in the
foreseeable future.
Others were less optimistic, suggesting that in the post-1996
situation support could diminish rapidly.
Rob Livesey, Glenapp Estates, Girvan, suggested farmers should be
cautious about how they used their money at a time of profitability.
''They should not be going out and paying stupid prices for land,'' he
said.
Farmers are stupid when they bid against each other for land and end
up over-borrowed -- which is what happened in the 1980s''
The area's milk convener, Ian Kerr, pointed out that among the
European Union member states it appeared that the British Government was
the only one expressing serious concerns about the Common Agricultural
Policy. ''We have to keep lobbying them about the benefits the consumer
gets from it.''
Former vice-convener of the union's milk committee Tom Reid said the
public failed to realise that the benefits they were getting in cheaper
food, in one way, had to be paid for in another way -- through taxes.
Mr Caldwell, who first raised the issue said that one of the biggest
tasks facing the union was to demonstrate to the public how their food
bill was made up. ''Never before in history has the average household
spent a smaller proportion of its income on food,'' he said.
''The message seems to be lost that food prices are at a low level.
They do not seem to understand that a piece of string is only so long.
We have to get the money from somewhere to produce food.''
Reservations about the new farm-assurance scheme for beef and lamb
were expressed by Alan Parker. Standards for beef had been omitted,
making it less attractive for store producers to join the scheme, he
said. It appeared that requirements had been reduced to the lowest
common denominator.
Peter Brown, who administers the new scheme, said yesterday that there
was no dilution of the scheme but under the new provisions there was no
separate sector covering suckler beef. Scottish beef in general had a
good image, he said, but there was no demand from the supermarkets for
separate identification of suckler beef as against beef that came as a
by-product from the dairy herd.

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH hill farmer who made a genuine mistake in filling out a
claim form for European subsidies is now several thousand pounds worse
off after having his claim disallowed.
His plight, among others, has been taken up by officials of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland who travelled to Brussels to
complain that the imposition of penalty rules was being taken to
ridiculous extremes.
The farmer concerned, who has not been named by the NFUS, lost all of
his livestock payments because of an error which over-stated the size of
his holding. In all other respects he qualified for assistance. Even at
the reduced size his farm was not overstocked.
John Ross, president of the NFUS, said that in their meeting with
European Commission officials they had demanded that commonsense be
applied in the policing of rules which were designed to combat fraud.
''In this case there was not the remotest prospect of fraud being the
motive,'' said Mr Ross. ''The mistake made no difference to the claim,
which met all the stocking density conditions of the livestock scheme.
''The NFU does not condone fraud and positively supports the
application of penalties to deter abuse of the support systems but it is
not impossible to frame the rules in a way which avoids serious hardship
to individual farmers when it is clear to all that an honest mistake has
been made.''
The case concerns a tenant hill farmer on land bordering the A9. When
he took over the tenancy a few years ago the holding was said to cover
307 hectares. All his subsequent integrated administration and control
system claims, and returns to the Scottish Office Agriculture
Department, were made on that basis -- the figure contained in the
tenancy agreement.
When he decided to join the environmentally-sensitive area
arrangements his land was measured up by Department of Agriculture
inspectors and was found to be only 233 hectares. Some land had been
lost from the farm at one point for the building of the upgraded A9.
As a result of the discrepancy all of his 1994 claims for Suckler Cow
Premium, Extensification Premium and Hill Land Compensatory Allowances
were declared ineligible.

FARMERS and their advisers may have to rewrite the rule book to meet
consumer demands on food and the environment and so remain profitable,
according to the latest trials on integrgated farming systems.
These trials, conducted as a joint venture by three major agricultural
companies are designed to find greener systems of producing quality food
in a responsible and profitable way as a middle course between
conventional and organic systems.
Although full costings are not yet available, representatives of the
companies involved -- Hydro Agri UK, the CWS, and Proforma -- told a
London news conference the results were sufficiently encouraging for
them to continue the trials.
''Perhaps we are on the verge of a new technological breakthrough
aided by such things as satellite analysis technology, but we are not
sure yet. There is a clear need for more work,'' said Tony Robinson,
Hydro's managing director.
Key to the system is the selection of the correct rotation for the
site. ''Rotation is the wheel which drives the system,'' said project
manager Alastair Leake. ''Our approach here is not an attempt to
reinvent this wheel -- more to take it and give it precise balancing and
tracking.''
It is not designed as a low input system. In fact, seed rates used for
winter wheat production are slightly higher than for conventional
systems. This is designed to offset losses and to provide greater
competition against weeds.
However, applications of fertilisers and chemicals are more closely
targeted to real needs, taking into account such variables as leaching
and soil mineral nitrogen levels using computer prediction systems and
even a chlorophyll meter.
''We are attempting to use a range of strategies to increase the
precision in which fertiliser is used and trying to prevent the loss of
nitrate from the system as a whole,'' said Mr Leake. This was
parallelled in systems for chemical application.
He admitted that high crop prices as a result of green pound
devaluations since Britain left the ERM might make growers sceptical
about the aims of the scheme. ''We are, however,learning how to use
inouts with greater precision and the information obtained will prove
invaluable in improving margins when crop prices deteriorate.''

* WINSOME, dew-fresh melodies propelling songs of heartbreak and
yearning. Timeless pure pop with jingling echoes of all the most
affecting tunesmiths: Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson, Gram Parsons, the
Lefte Bank, Roger McGuinn, Carole King. Listen to what the Bandits sing
and know they tell the truth: ''Hello again and welcome to my heart.
You've been here before, but it's time for a brand new start.'' Made in
Scotland from sparkly wee hurry-home drops, and speaking directly of
babies, love, and pain.
Atlantic Grooves: The Funk'n'Jazz Experience Volume 1, various
(Atlantic)
* EIGHTEEN steaming slabs of low-down soulful feelings. Shake your
booty in a breathless Rock Steady fashion with Aretha Franklin! Get
woozy with Eddie Harris's Drunk Man! Seize the moment with Otis Redding
and indulge in some Groovin' Time! But heed the words of Doctor John!
When yuh truly feelin' funkuh, yuh sometimes Can't Git Enuff!
21 Karat Fatback, the Fatback Band (Ace)
* A propulsive sampling of the sweetly soulful disco-funk furrow
ploughed by the Fatbacks during the most successful spell -- 1974-83 --
of their 17-year career. Jump to your funky feet and cry 'Yes indeed,
Lordy, Lordy!' when the Fatbacks ask if you're ready to do the Bus Stop,
the Double Dutch, and/or the Spanish Hustle.
DAVID BELCHER
Under the Wire, Jerry Douglas (Sugar Hill)
* THE poet of the dobro (acoustic guitar with metal resonators)
invites some heavyweight chums in for a play on tunes ranging from a
stark guitar/banjo duet to Fairport Convention-like jigging to jazz/rock
fusion to solid, crunching blues. The Nashville gloss occasionally
flirts with Muzak but Bela Fleck's superbly ironic banjo playing, Mark
O'Connor's keening, inventive fiddling, and Douglas's inimitable slide
guitar work have the edge.
Courage, Love and Grace, Pete Morton (Harbourtown)
* THE mystifyingly underappreciated Morton's fourth album finds the
aggressive young man of earlier times more relaxed and reflective but
still a hugely compelling singer, harnessing the energy into a weighty
whisper that sounds at times like a rustic but less studied Peter
Gabriel. The songs are incisive and compassionate and the arrangements
chiselled to a nicety, with Sally Barker's dispassionate vocals lending
an extraordinary presence.
ROB ADAMS
Blue Skies, Harry Allen Quartet (John Marks Records)
* CURRENTLY heir most apparent to the tenor sax throne, Allen is on
top form on this superb selection which also spotlights the talents of
pianist John Bunch (formerly of Scott Hamilton's band). Allen's ear for
the unusual melody and the unexpected harmony is obvious throughout;
particularly on the near-perfect Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year,
with its sudden searing emotional ending. But the absolute standout is
the achingly romantic How Insensitive -- a real samba to smooch to.
Nothing But the Blues, Herb Ellis (Verve)
* BILLIE Holiday said that there were two kinds of blues: happy and
sad. This CD -- a reissue of the 1957 album -- proves that there are
plenty of other moods in between. Like the dirty, mean, and lowdown
style of Pap's Blues and the excellent Tin Roof Blues on which Ellis's
laid-back strumming is beautifully complemented by Stan Getz's Lester
Young-sounding (ie: Presidential) sax and Roy Eldridge's cool muted
trumpet. All three front-liners also get their teeth into the brilliant
Blues For Janet. Finger-snappingly good stuff.

* KEEPING tabs on plants can be quite a problem for many gardeners.
The latest idea is: try a thin sheet of copper.
The Verdigris people suggest that copper Tee labels, plant tags, and
plant markers, at varying prices, are the answer to wooden tags that rot
away, or plastic ones that disintegrate.
Engrave the name, with a ballpoint pen, and do it firmly to give a
clear, and hopefully everlasting, result.

Can bamboo grow and sell in Scotland? Sue Clapham provides the answer
Picture: SUE CLAPHAM
* BAMBOO may not seem the most obvious choice for gardens in Scotland
but Anne and John Lenting of the Scottish Bamboo Nursery near Alford in
Aberdeenshire are all set to demonstrate what this versatile and
attractive plant has to offer.
From a possible 1500 or so varieties they have collected 50, chosen
for their ability to withstand the Scottish climate. Many grown
naturally in the Himalayas and Siberia and are extremely hard,
withstanding temperatures as now as -26[DEG]C.
The surprising diversity of bamboo also means that there is a plant
for nearly every situation be it screening or hedging, the rockery or as
ground cover.
''Bamboo is particularly good for hedging as it grows so quickly,''
Anne explains.
The leaves, some of which can be variegated, range from short and
narrow to as broad and long as palms.
And the canes differ not only in colours which include red, gold,
black, and green but also in shapes -- round, square, zig-zag and
knotted.
John, a former airline pilot, and Anne who works from British Airways,
have had plenty of opportunity to see bamboo in its more unusual setting
but it was seeing it thrive in various outdoor locations in Scotland --
such as in the grounds of Fyvie Castle near Turriff -- that inspired
them to set up the business.
While other nurseries may supply imported plants, Anne and John
believe they are unique in growing and propagating the bamboo
themselves. Although they only started last year, they are already
building a third polytunnel in which to bring on the young plants.
And to illustrate what can be achieved, the Lentings are establishing
their own Bamboo Garden, complete with water course and appropriate
trees to enhance the scene.
''We're about 900 feet up here,'' John points out, ''and all but one
of the 100 plants we had outside survived the winter.''
The bamboo is sold in five-litre pots to make sure it leaves the
nursery with a strong root system.
''They can be trimmed or cut back according to requirements but
require little other maintenance,'' Anne says. ''Generally they are
disease free and the fallen leaves which are full of silica, provide
nourishment for the plant. They're also easy to split and propogate.''
On their travels Anne and John have seen the way bamboo is used in the
making of furniture, flooring and paper, not to mention musical
instruments. This has encouraged them to offer bamboo products to
complement the plant side of the business.
''We can supply bamboo flooring through the auspices of a friend who
is a bamboo expert and has a nursery in Holland,'' says John. ''Not only
is the flooring attractive and hard wearing but it comes from a
genuinely sustainable resource.''
The Lentings will also be supplying high-quality, decorative fencing
panels -- the only original Japanese panels of their kind in Europe --
and, for that final exotic touch, hand crafted pottery from Malaysia.
Anne and John are hoping to attend one or two shows this year,
including Scotbloom in Aberdeen from June 2-4 and the Plant Sale held at
the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh on June 11. They are producing a
detailed catalogue and are always happy to welcome visitors to th
nursery.
But every business has its down side. During the summer they will have
to tear themslves away to attend the Fourth World Bamboo Congress,
Festival and International Bamboo Workshop -- in Bali.

* FOR my sins, I have recently been involved in demonstrating hanging
basket filling in several garden centres in England and nearer home.
These baskets come in all shapes and sizes. You can still get the
old-fashioned wire ones, which are popular despite their problems of
high water demand.
I have tried plastic self-watering types, which are reasonably
efficient but don't look as attractive, especially as you can only plant
on the tops of the baskets.
Some gardeners stick faithfully to sphagnum moss as a liner, but you
can get fibre and plastic, not forgetting a new material which is simply
waste wool.
There are few places you can't have hanging baskets. Some people like
them at the front door, others at the side of the house, and adjacent to
the patio is very popular.
They are being edged out a bit by containers, but I don't see why. The
two complement each other beautifully.
Wherever you put them, remember they will need watering regularly.
This means having access unless you have one of the plastic bottle-type
waterers with a long-hooked extension.
You need to be careful about securing the baskets. Apart from the mess
if they clattered down, they could cause damage and injury. Bear in mind
that a rocking basket could loosen its bracket.
As for compost, there is now a special material which differs from
ordinary potting compost by being finer in texture, which means it holds
water better.
Gels are available which act like mini-sponges in the compost. As for
plant selection, let your artistic temperament run wild.
There is a lot to be said for never-fail plants such as geraniums,
fuchsias, trailing lobelia, petunias, Busy Lizzies and begonias, which
are ideal for summer baskets.
Now for the nitty gritty of filling the baskets. Hold the basket on
top of a large pot while you fill it. If it is a solid one, place a few
crocks in the bottom above any drainage system. Omit crocks with a
self-watering system.
Select your liner for a wire basket and put it into position. Many
gardeners put a saucer in the bottom to hold water. Whether you put thin
plastic over the liner is a matter of choice.
Half-fill the basket with moist compost and make slits in the side,
through which young trailing plants are pushed. Trailing lobelia is
ideal.
Finish filling the basket and plant the top with upright plants in the
centre and trailing plants round the edge.
End with the compost level about an inch or so below the top of the
basket. Give the basket a good watering and keep it in the greenhouse
for two or three weeks before putting it outdoors.
In our climate, this is best done in the second or third week in May.
An excellent new book from Dr D G Hessayon on containers gives a lot
more detail for #4.99.
* WHAT'S the organic answer to pests and diseases? It could be a
partnership of active ingredients like fatty acids and sulphur,
according to Levington.
Its latest product -- Nature's Answer Fungicide and Insect Killer --
is claimed to give control of pests like greenfly, blackfly, whitefly,
red spider mite, mealy bugs, and thrips, as well as the powdery mildew
disease.
It comes in a handy spray form, convenient for the smaller garden, or
indeed the gardener concerned at mixing and measuring liquid
concentrates.

* FEW features in the garden make as much impact as a tree, yet many
people are afraid to plant what they feel could become an unruly giant,
writes KENNEDY WILSON.
The most important consideration is the tree's ultimate size, not its
size when bought. Garden centres should supply details of likely height
and spread at maturity, and this should be your guide. Ash, sycamore and
chestnut trees should be avoided for most small and medium-sized
gardens. There are more compact and attractive varieties of tree
available.
The ever-popular flowering Japanese Cherry makes a beautiful sight for
a few weeks in spring with its heavy blossom, and the narrow form
Amanogawa is suitable for even the smallest garden. However, cherry
trees are rather dull for the rest of the year, and where there is only
room for one tree, probably the best choice is a variety of Sorbus. The
Rowan grows higher up Scottish hillsides than any other tree and only
grows to medium size. It produces bright red berries and good autumn
colour. One special variety to look out for is Joseph Rock with deep
autumn colour and bright yellow berries.
The Japanese Maple has small, elegantly-lobed leaves and grows slowly
into a small tree. Most have soft green summer leaves and bright autumn
colours, though Atropurpureum has muddy purple foliage. The finest
variety is probably Ozakazuki, whose intense scarlet autumn colour makes
it look like it's on fire.
For gardens where space is not a problem the graceful Silver Birch is
a favourite and casts little shade. The clear white bark of the mature
tree is a beautiful sight, especially against the background of dark
conifers. Birch should ideally be planted to the north of the house so
that the bark catches the sunlight.
The Norway Maple is also an excellent all-round choice where room
allows. It produces small yellow flowers in spring, followed by bright,
attractive leaves and good yellow autumn colour. The Red Maple from
North America is another fairly large growing tree which derives its
name from the tiny red flowers it produces in spring. The Red Maple
usually shows glorious red and yellow autumn colours. Only one type of
ash is worth planting in the garden. The Caucasian variety Raywood has
delicate narrow leaflets that turn an unusual smoky purple in autumn.
For sheer speed of growth few trees can compete with Eucalyptus
Gunnii, which will quickly romp away and produce a handsome crown of
feathery blue-green leaves that remain on the tree all year round. One
of the most attractive trees from the Orient has become increasingly
popular. Cercidiphyllum Japonicum has dainty heart-shaped leaves which
emerge shrimp-pink and turn green. In autumn the foliage turns varying
shades of pink, yellow and red. The buds also produce a substance that
smells deliciously like toffee apples.
* NOTES: Dig a hole only a little larger than the root spread. Stake
trees over six feet. If using a stake, put it in before the tree. Secure
to the tree with a rubber tie. Work a handful of bone meal into the
soil. Tread in firmly.

It pays to take your time when planting half-hardy bedding plants,
asserts a patient IAN WALLS
* WHEN it is safe to plant out half-hardy bedding plants? The question
prompts never-ending arguments. You can be sure they will be on sale any
time now. While there used to be qualms about risking sales too early,
some establishments are so keen to boost turnover that ethics tend to be
forgotten.
There is nothing wrong in buying half-hardy bedding plants a bit
earlier than usual. This is fine provided you can keep them under cover
for a week or two. You could be taking a big risk in planting them too
early. A night's frost could take a deadly toll.
A lot depends, of course, on where you happen to live. Some areas are
notorious for late spring frosts. It can happen right into June. You may
live in the lofty heights of places such as Kilmacolm, or you could
enjoy a very balmy climate beside the sea where late spring frosts are a
rarity.
Parks departments up and down the country tend to play safe. Many will
not bed out until the end of May or early June. Another reason is to get
the best out of spring bedding before that is removed. This applies to
many gardens too.
I often wonder why there is all this rush to get bedding plants in so
soon anyway. I have a neighbour who raises her own plants and it is
often well through June before she gets anything planted out. She has a
magnificent show.
Lots of gardeners raising their own bedding plants tend to find
themselves in this situation. This is so particularly this year, due to
cold damp weather in March and April.
Another incentive to buy early is getting the pick of the bunch. It is
true that some popular lines sell out, but there are plenty of plants
for sale this year. There may even be a surplus Take time to have a look
around. Look for sturdy, dark green plants, as opposed to those which
are light green and a bit lanky.
Prices are bound to vary, as you will find if you shop around. A
tenner can go quite a way to supplying your needs. Buy carefully.
* BEDDING plants on the whole are not generally too greedy when it
comes to food. Put into too rich a soil, some will tend to produce a lot
of leaf, to the detriment of flowers.
Petunias come into this category. Take time to cultivate the soil
thoroughly. What bedding plants love is well-decayed organic matter.
Be wary of using improperly composted garden refuse. This can often be
a tremendous source of weeds, and an intolerable nuisance.
I am using a mixture of composted hen manure, sawdust and other waste
industrial organic materials This is being produced on an experimental
basis. Its analysis is turning out very similar to well-known brands of
potting compost.
It will not be on sale for some time yet. What would be a very good
idea is to use good potting compost, in little planting pockets which
will get your plants off to a flying start.
I would not have suggested this a year or so back but prices are
highly competitive this season In any case, you won't use massive
amounts if you stick to the pocket technique.
It is worth checking whether your borders are sweet or sour, using a
pH test kit. Alternatively have your soil laboratory-analysed. If you
spend money on plants, it is worth spending a bit more to get things
really right.
* SPACING for bedding plants can vary enormously. It can be 6in apart
for lobelia and alyssum, and 9-12in for taller items. You won't go far
wrong if you calculate on the basis of a dozen or so plants in a square
yard with a mix of items.
To be really methodical, you should measure up and plant with a
straight edge -- a piece of wood about two yards long, marked off every
six inches.
This is what I used in the Botanic Gardens many years ago. They liked
to get their displays very precise and in line.
* THERE are lots of exciting new bedding plants around this year. Many
gardeners prefer to stick to old faithfuls. The favourite used to be
antirrhinum for the centre, with lobelia and alyssum for edging, and
there is a lot to be said for this.
It tends to be a bit monotonous. Creeping in fast are massed beds of
begonia semperflorens, with a wonderful range of colours, and busy
Lizzies. Ornamental cabbages are very popular.
Also useful for mass display where you want a bit of height are
seedling dahlias. I never fail to grow these and they give a magnificent
show with plenty of cut blooms.
Fuchsias are becoming big business and give a super display. You can
vary things by having one or two standard fuchsias in the middle.
We have a bit of conflict in our household. I like geraniums and my
wife doesn't. In practical terms, geraniums or pelargoniums are ideal
bedders. I saw a bed last year where they had been interplanted with
gladioli. It was magnificent.
Talking of interplanting reminds me that kochia or burning bush will
break up the monotony of a bed beautifully. Don't forget marigolds,
particularly the new strains of what are called American types. Remember
the old faithfuls, French marigolds, for edging. And remember that they
are very susceptible to frost. So are tagetes.
What about nemesia? It gives a marvellous display for edging. They
tend to fade a bit. Tobacco plants called nicotiana have some lovely
dwarf types. Make sure you do get dwarf varieties, otherwise they tend
to get very tall.
As you shop around, there will be names that you may not know. Try
something new, but it takes a lot to beat the old favourites. In any
case, you will find it is the popular lines which tend to be stocked.

IT is certainly all work and no play in the garden at this time of
year, writes IAN WALLS. It can be difficult to know where to start. The
pattern of work does, of course, vary from garden to garden. But I
reckon my place is pretty average, with a bit of just about everything,
so here's what has been keeping me busy:
Lawns: Regular cutting from one to three times a week is a top
priority. A feature of lawns at this time is the prolific seeding of
annual meadowgrass which blows in from everywhere. Regular cutting keeps
up appearances, as does regular feeding.
Fruits: Things are looking pretty good here. I do notice some die-back
of buds, due to spur blight, caused no doubt by a wet winter and
possibly over-feeding with quick-acting fertilisers.
Spraying with a fungicide may help. I feel there are sufficient
unaffected buds to produce a good yield. With gooseberries, it is time
to keep a close watch for saw fly. Little green caterpillars can devour
everything, almost overnight.
Spraying with a good insecticide will help. You can use derris or
malathion. Repeated sprays may be be needed to catch emerging
caterpillars.
With blackcurrants, the bane of many gardeners' lives is big bud mite.
I notice I have one or two swollen buds. These are best picked off and
burned.
While Benlate has been recommended in the past, used when leaves are
about the size of a 10p piece, there is some question of its use on
environmental grounds.
Technically speaking, big-bud-infested bushes should be removed, as
they serve as a source of infestation. This applies in your own and
neighbours' gardens.
My strawberries look reasonably healthy. For the whole fruit garden, a
round to control weeds linked with application of an environmental
weedkiller such as Weedmaster is very much on the cards.
Vegetables: In this section, it is a question of waiting for
germination of all the seeds sown in the last few weeks. The recent hot
sunny weather has dried out the ground, perhaps too quickly.
In general, weeding by hoeing is a must. There may also have to be
some hand-weeding between peas and beans, where hoeing is impracticable.
In the shrub and rose section, hoeing, forking and general titivation
is the order of the day. Note any casualties which have occurred over
winter.
Greenhouse: Hardening off self-raised bedding plants is tricky,
especially as night frost can still occur. You have to use judgment.
Have a good look at a clear sky in the evening. Listen to the weather
forecast.
Once benches are clear, you can go ahead with pot plants, cucumbers,
or even tomatoes, which you can handle in growing bags. It may mean
restricted height for development but a lot can be done by training
plants under the ridge.
With the main crop on the ground, in the border or in growing bags or
boxes, to keep night temperatures not less than around 55deg F. should
be the aim. Plus regular watering.
Once tomatoes get under way, they grow at a tremendous rate. Support
will be needed at an early stage, with canes and wire paper ties, or
strings looped around lower leaves, on to strong wires overhead.
Do not underestimate the watering demands of tomatoes. They are
considerable. Without an irrigation system, daily watering may be
needed.

REMARKABLE, isn't it, how the sun has the power to slow the pace of
life, bringing on an overwhelming temptation to enjoy the garden -- not
by working in it but by relaxing in it.
But how to sit, relax and unwind? Recent real warmth has brought
hordes of sunworshippers flocking to garden centres and other retail
outlets in search of the answer -- comfortable and attractive seating
for gardens and conservatories.
There's a terrific variety of conservatory and outdoor furniture
available now, dedicated to enjoying the better weather. The styles you
choose will depend on the type of house and garden you have. If space is
at a premium, clearly it's unwise to buy large and bulky pieces which
will be impossible to store. Instead, look at the many folding designs
in upright chairs or loungers which take up minimal space.
If you're lucky enough not to have to worry about such details, there
are some wonderful examples of garden furniture which evoke memories of
more glamorous, leisurely eras. It shouldn't be hard to choose well,
whatever your taste or purse, but don't forget the golden rule: before
parting with your cash, sit or lie on the furniture to make sure it's
really comfortable for you.

* THE adjective-cum-noun ''antique'' is fine, although going up in
price daily, but what about the verb ''to antique''? I don't think it is
a real verb at all, although it's now enshrined in Chamber's. I think it
is a bad-taste verb, sick transitive inglorious, designed to give
spurious legitimacy to an act of sheer vandalism.
(Here I pause to gulp some fizzy mineral water. My lecture students at
the University of Camelon, where I occupy the Disneyland Chair of Bad
Taste, watch me uncomprehendingly with their beady eyes, damn them. I
wish I'd been an engine driver, which was my first choice: I could be
taking it easy now on my redundo. I burp and continue.)
Recently I read about Richard, who is doing up a bijou double-house in
a London mews, and doesn't appear to shave every day. Richard
''antiqued'' his dresser. ''There is a standard pine dresser in the
dining room,'' I read, ''which Richard aged by rubbing it with a block
of wet lime then varnishing it. 'I hate new pine, but I love old wood,
so this is a good way of treating it'.'' Now the question I'd like you
students to consider today is this: If Richard hates new pine, but loves
old wood, then why did he buy a new pine dresser? Yes -- you at the
back.
(Small voice: ''Because he couldn't afford an old pine dresser.'')
OK, that's a possibility, although I doubt it very much. People who
pose for their picture in glossy magazines wearing jeans and having not
shaved can generally buy and sell the rest of us twice over, to say
nothing of an old pine dresser. I noticed also that Richard had
''antiqued'' his jeans, and quite possibly his shirt too. What does this
tell us? Yes -- you at the front.
(Another small voice: ''That Richard is interested in textures, the
warmth and patina of old things.'')
Well of course he is. Aren't we all? But we know that genuine old
things are very, very expensive -- not necessarily because they're worth
having but because we want them. So this is the philosophical question
I'm asking. Are people who ''antique'' their modern pine dressers, and
use dragged paint effects on their doors -- which, incidentally, makes
the door look as if it was decorated by an alcoholic -- trying to make a
cash-statement which has nothing to do with textures, warmth and patina?
I'd also like you to place yourself in the position of a modern pine
dresser craftsman, invited to Richard's bijou pad, who finds that
Richard has been defacing his handiwork with a block of wet lime. I'd
like you to speculate, in 1000 words, how the conversation went at
dinner.
(That was the end of another lecture, thank God. I clearly heard one
of the students, whom I'd rather fancied unfortunately, saying ''Silly
old berk'' as she flounced out. Not a good day.)

SYLVIA von Hartmann's picturesque cottage buzzes with creative energy,
writes AILEEN LITTLE. The German artist, whose work is found in public
and private collections -- including the Queen's -- has no television.
Instead, she uses her leisure to produce the unique furnishings which
decorate her home.
The house's exterior is treat enough. Tucked inside the Royal Mile's
historic White Horse Close, it has a fairy-tale quality behind a jumble
of overflowing plant tubs.
Inside, the award-winning artist comes into her own. She has made
every cushion cover, tablecloth and napkin. She has painted her
''trademark'' German folk motifs on tables, cupboards and chairs. When
she needed a fireplace, she rolled out clay, stamped out shapes with a
biscuit-cutter, and produced some glorious tiles. And every lampshade of
white calico, like the table linen and cushion covers, is edged with
charming, child-like potato-cut prints.
Even the pale blue stairs are painted in German script with lines from
Goethe and Schiller. The kitchen floor is home-made too. ''The
terracotta tiles are rejects from the Balmoral Hotel -- they were lying
outside in a heap,'' she says. ''I have made mosaics of the initials of
people who mean something in my life.''
Upstairs, the glass panels of bedroom doors have been sandblasted into
the pretty, natural forms which pervade this artist's work. No
flowerpot, no shoe box or bedspread has been left unadorned by leaf
shapes or trails of nasturtiums.
Stylised birds and animals, straight from a Victorian sampler, make
another theme. It sounds over the top, yet in the hands of a painter
trained in illustration and printmaking, the effect is skilfully judged
and co-ordinated. Yet she insists that anyone -- if so minded -- can be
similarly creative. ''You can do it! You can!'' she cries infectiously.
At this point, she leaps from the table, returning with a basket
overflowing with eggshells she has blown. The end-products are
exquisitely painted eggs displayed in an antique birdcage.
Is she content in the charming little world she has created? ''Yes,
give me a mousehole and I'm happy. I work away with little leaves and
cones -- I don't need gold and silver. I love every room here so much,
sometimes I just sit on the stairs and absorb it.''
* Sylvia von Hartmann's paintings form part of a Scottish exhibition
in the Adam Gallery, Bath, from May 20-June 17. Her work can also be
seen in the Loomshop Gallery, Lower Largo, during the Festival.

ARE you sitting comfortably? asks KENNEDY WILSON. Chances are you're
settled into a chair with a nice pile of cushions and the last thing on
your mind is their artistic merit.
But a selling exhibition scheduled for next month will prove that
cushions can comfort the eye too. It has commissioned a range of artiss
to produce designs in a range of fabrics and materials -- some as
outlandish as latex rubber and PVC.
So can a cushion really be a work of art? ''Absolutely!'' says Lesley
Dignon, owner of Dignon Collective Gallery in Edinburgh whose Designer
Cushions exhibition will put paid to the idea that cushions are just
cushions. She calls them ''the dulcet art form''.
The show contains traditional as well as avant garde designs -- the
work of established national and international designers such as Tessuti
and Mairi Brown -- along with work from design and art students from all
over the country.
In terms of interior design, cushions represent a relatively cheap way
to introduce colour, as well as comfort, to a room and they are
adaptable and easy to change. They can jazz up an old piece of furniture
or give your sofa or chairs a fresh new summer look. But it's often
difficult to get interesting and original designs.
Work by the London duo Hampshire and Dillon includes attractive
bolsters and scatter cushions with side lacings that give an informal,
nautical feel. They have also produced a range of printed covers with
crenellated edges and tassels. The prints include suns and shells and
six-legged beetles.
The exhibition also shows that cushions don't have to be square --
round and bolster shapes are popular and you can even have heart-shaped.
''We have one design that's 40 inches long by 12 inches wide,'' says
Lesley. ''There are lots of lush velvets in the show and traditional
Tudor-styled brocade with tassels as well as more plain materials like
jute and calico.''
One method of decorating fabric that is currently very popular is
heat-sealing images on to fabric. Architectural patterns are also
fashionable, as are Aran-style knitted cushions.
Lesley Dignon, who has some of her own cushions in the show, has some
emblazoned with images from the paintings by Lautrec and Van Gogh. And
if that doesn't prove that cushions can be art . . .
* Designer Cushions is at the Dignon Collective Gallery, 46 Dundas
Street, Edinburgh (0131 5561820) from June 3-30. Prices range from #12
to over #100.

It was an exciting challenge from Marley Building Materials to
imaginative architects -- conceive the ideal Scottish home for the
future. CALA Homes agreed to build the winner and The Herald agreed to
'adopt' it and follow its progress, which has now begun in Cumbernauld.
Here, Beverley Brown looks at the first stages of the flexible,
spacious, energy-efficient Herald Home for Today
EXACTLY two years ago this month, a competition was launched for
registered architects with the brief ''to design a house for the future
using existing technology and traditional materials''.
Two years down the line, work has begun on the foundations, and the
prototype house of the future is about to become a reality at Dullatur
in Cumbernauld.
Marley Building Materials, which had originally conceived the
competition, approached the Royal Incorporation of Architects in
Scotland -- which suggested that Marley should take the idea one stage
further and actually have the winning design built.
CALA Homes stepped forward -- and became joint sponsor of the project,
which became known as The Herald Home for Today.
''The competition brief specified the use of existing technology and
materials with building in mind,'' says John Curtis, CALA's design
director. ''We wanted a forward-looking design, but not so far forward
that the materials wouldn't be available for construction.''
More than 70 designs were submitted and judged by a panel of
architects, and sponsors Alan Downie of CALA Homes and David Trapnell of
Marley Building Materials. The winning design -- by Bristol architect
Andrew Kenyon -- was announced at the Interbuild exhibition in
Birmingham in October 1993.
Kenyon, whose prize was #6000, then worked up his design drawings to
building drawings.
Meanwhile, the plot didn't thicken, it merely changed. CALA had
originally earmarked a site in Edinburgh, but when it realised that the
winning design was to be a single-storey building, it switched to an
existing site of one and two-storey homes at Dullatur.
''Once we saw the design we realised that it would fit in better at
Cumbernauld, which is also a more central location,'' says Curtis. At
this stage CALA applied for and received, at the beginning of 1994,
planning consent and building warrants.
With CALA aiming for a September completion, what will the home of the
future be like? According to Curtis it will be flexible, spacious, full
of light, and very energy efficient.
Kenyon has taken the conservatory away from its usual position at the
back of the house and made it the focal point of his design. It is right
in the middle of the home. All the other rooms lead off this area but
the conservatory can also be shut off, while still allowing access
between the remaining rooms.
In total, the Dullatur home will have three bedrooms, one with
en-suite bathroom, a second bathroom, large living room with feature
wood burning stove, kitchen and separate utility room.
Solar energy from the conservatory's glass roof, plus the very latest
technology in boilers, will keep fuel bills to a minimum. Insulation
will also be taken to new levels; cavity wall construction normally
allows 260mm thickness, but this design is almost double this, with
walls 440mm thick.
In addition to being largely self-sufficient in energy terms, the
design is also environment-friendly, using timber from managed
woodlands, even down to the pond in the garden which will fill with
rainwater from the roof.
Internal finishes will be kept simple to enhance the feeling of space,
and the garage can be easily converted to a study or additional lounge.
The only thing missing is the price. ''Since we started to lay the
foundations, we have been going through the exercise of making sure we
had the rest of the materials,'' Curtis explains. ''These are now on
order, and so far all we have is a vague building cost, but no fixed
selling price yet.
''Despite the lack of a price ticket, a great deal of interest has
been generated so far, although most inquirers say they will reserve
judgment until they can see the finished home,'' he says.
For now it's a case of waiting and watching what may be the prototype
of a solar-powered lifestyle for homeowners of the future. One buyer
will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the ubiquitous
Joneses will be out of the running.
KEY TO PLAN: 1, Retaining wall; 2, single-glazed conservatory; 3,
bedroom; 4, Bedroom; 5, Bathroom; 6, Bathroom; 7, Bedroom; 8, Living
room; 9, Gas-condensing room heater in snug; 10, Kitchen; 11,

There are several punk numbers which speedway star David Walsh takes
out for a spin now and again, finds Keith Moore
PICTURE this: a man on a motorbike, tearing around a racetrack. With
the roar of the engines and the yells of the crowd, you can almost smell
the dirt and the oil. What would the soundtrack be? Something by The
Byrds from Easy Rider perhaps? The Doors' On The Storm? David Essex's
seminal Silver Dream Racer? Wrong, on all counts, especially if the
rider was David Walsh, captain of the hotshoein' Glasgow Tigers Speedway
team.
Halifax-born and now in his third season with The Tigers, a team
which, under his supremacy has discovered dizzying heights of success,
such as it has not enjoyed for many a season. Indeed, Walsh has become
something of an adopted hero. The facts are plain: The Tigers have won
the league and cup double over the last two years, and personally he
holds the team's record for most number of points scored in one season.
Meanwhile on the turntable stakes, he has an eclectic taste, with a
predilection for guitar-based American bands.
His first album, he reckons, was Penetration's Moving Targets. This
four-piece combo, led by Pauline Murray, was at the forefront of punk
right back at the very start, but unlike many other bands of the time,
were actually able to play and write good tunes. Before that purchase,
like many other impressionable lads, he listened to his elder brother's
record collection, which was pretty standard 70s fare by the sounds of
it: Jethro Tull, The Who etc, etc, long guitar solos, etc.
Like most of us, he is a careful record buyer. Having had his fingers
burned on numerous occasions in bouts of impulse-buying, he now prefers
to buy either on the recommendations of magazine reviews, or preferably
of friends.
He admits that some of his earlier records were sold in the late 1970s
''to finance bits for the bikes''. Of these, he now regrets selling some
classic albums by The Beatles; Revolver and Rubber Soul, and some Bowie
albums. By his own admission, his record collection is ''fractured'',
not only in terms of content, but in geographical location. ''Some of my
collection is at home in Halifax, so what you see here are my all-time
favourites.'' These include albums by Nick Cave, , Big Black, Sonic
Youth, and Morphine. The Fidelity Inspector doesn't particularly enjoy
edited highlights, but as records are like pocketfuls of memories, I
decided to delve a little into his past.
As a teenager, growing up on the cusp of punk, much of his early life
was spent listening to loud, raucous noise. But strangely, given his
birthplace, Northern Soul passed him by. ''There were two clubs in our
area, one punk and one Northern Soul. I spent most of my time at the
punk club. Just think, my life could have been much different.''
Before that however, and to prove the power music has to capture the
essence of the moment, he remembers his first snog at a school
end-of-term disco. The song: Chicago's If You Leave Me Now. The girl: he
wouldn't tell.
Although not having a favourite album of all time, he has albums which
mean different things to different times in his life: The Jam's All Mod
Cons, Second Hand Daylight by Magazine and The Smiths' debut album. .
Posing a hypothetical question, I asked: ''If you were allowed a
personal stereo while riding your bike, what would be on the tape?''
''Strangely enough, music plays a large part in my work, both on and
off the track. I carry songs in my head to race meetings, and in 1990
while riding for Berwick I got to the semi-final of the British
championships. There was a song in my head that day; I Want To Kill
Somebody by a band called Smash -- it's venomously anti-Tory. Anyway, I
rode like a loony and won a place in the finals. Similar things have
happened in Glasgow with songs by The Pixies.
''I spend a lot of time travelling up and down the country in the van.
I've constantly got music on. In fact it is probably the main quality
time I have to listen to new music. The radio is so banal, so I make up
compilations or tape my latest purchases. Music is necessity to me. It's
like the food of life, and I'd go mad without it.''
There are songs which remind him of speedway. ''I remember back in the
mid-70s, I was a bit of an Abba fan (weren't we all?) and Leicester
speedway circuit will forever remind me of Dancing Queen as they played
it constantly over the Tannoys. In my mind the two are inextricably
linked. While racing for Berwick, they used to play Speedway Star by The
Pastels each time I won a race. It kind of became my soundtrack.''
Speedway Star indeed, and if any of you music dudes, jaded by the
football terraces, are looking for a new sport to follow, make your way
to Shawfield where each Sunday you'll find David Walsh racing to the
sounds of grind-core (albeit in his head) and winning.

LADDER OF YEARS
Anne Tyler
Chatto &amp; Windus, #14.99
WHEN Delia left her family, her absence was unnoticed for four hours.
Neither her husband nor their three adult children know the colour of
her eyes, nor can they agree on what she was wearing.
For years she has been taken for granted, to the extent that she
welcomes insignificance and believes her position in the family is
unimportant. Since she was 17, Delia's life has been centred on her
husband, Dr Sam Grinstead. She has not so much as glanced at another man
since meeting Sam. Even in her daydreams, she is the not the type to be
unfaithful.
Her two sisters think she is weak and slightly silly. They left home
when they married, but Delia has always lived in the house where she was
born. She has become used to retiring into herself, to melting into the
background. She married a man like her father, though she has lately
come to wonder if Sam married her to inherit her father's medical
practice.
Everyone thinks he is a good doctor and he is valued in their
community. Delia ponders her discovery while waiting downstairs as Sam
attends a patient in the middle of the night. Delia is simply doing what
she has always done, first for her father and now for Sam.
It's difficult to ascribe motivation; it's more an accumulation of
circumstances, rather than a decisive moment, but Delia simply wanders
off. There has been Adrian, who showed some attention, a little
affection and promised illicit pleasure she has never known.
They met in a supermarket. He had been hovering and spoke when he saw
his wife and her lover. She had recently left him, abandoning all her
possessions, but when he tells Delia she is ''little, dainty and
delicate'' she enjoys his implications. When his mother-in-law accuses
Delia of ruining Adrian's marriage, her family consider it ridiculous.
Anne Tyler seems to insinuate her characters and information. It is
difficult to imagine a writer so prodigiously gifted; her work appears
to be effortless. She is one of the most accomplished and impressive
novelists of her generation, one of the very few contemporary writers
one reads with a real sense of discovery.
She establishes an intimacy, which is wholly captivating, as though we
were sharing secrets, or overhearing private conversations. The skill is
most obvious in the delicate way she sketches her main characters so
that we come to anticipate their movements, to foresee their reactions
because we know them so well.
But even her minor characters arrive fully formed. Shallow people are
a speciality, but they are never stereotypes. She tells us that Adrian's
former wife, Rosemary, ''carried nothing but a purse the size of a
sandwich, on a glittering golden chain''. Earlier, she had come as close
as she gets to generalisation: ''Women like Rosemary never purchase
their groceries by the cartload.'' Given that these observations are
made against the background of their meeting on the aisles of a
supermarket, what else do we need to know?
The real pleasure of this new book is savoured after it's been read.
Each of the characters are with us and we wonder how they are.
Delia's bid for freedom, her attempt to re-invent herself in a new
town -- renting a room, taking a job, getting involved in the intimacy
of small-town living -- does not prove as attractive as she thought.
Real life threatens.
By understanding Delia, Anne Tyler not only forces us to acknowledge
and reassess the role of such women, she also makes shelves of political
tracts and argument redundant.

Artist Ken Currie tells Ann Donald what features on his nocturnal
reading list
I USED to do an hour's reading every night. That was like seven days a
week, 52 weeks of the year, and I got through a lot of material. But
it's been really difficult to find the time and to concentrate on a book
since the little one arrived.
The last book I read was Crowds and Power by Elias Cannetti. It's
about the psychology of crowds in history, the power of the crowd, how
they formed and what motivates them.
Cannetti goes into it in anthropological detail, talking about African
and Southern American tribes and how their ancient rituals manifest in
crowds today. It's a fascinating book that's more poetry than science.
The book before that was a really strange book by Klaus Theweleit
called Male Fantasies Volume 1. It's part of a two-volume study of the
writings of a group called the Freikorps Officers in the twenties. They
were a voluntary army composed of First World War veterans who wandered
around Germany taking part in acts of repression against workers. In
fact, they were the nucleus of the Nazi army.
The book focuses on some of the romantic novels that a few of their
key officers wrote, and what Theweleit is trying to do is decode the
Nazi ideology through these romantic ideas. It's a totally horrifying
book.
The essence of what they're really scared of is femininity --
womanhood. It's an academic book with a lot of very powerful
illustrations that underline the text.
Central to the book is this theme of repressed homosexuality. It's not
the kind of thing to talk about, because it appears to be a smear on the
gay movement, but that's definitely not the intention.
The Freikorps were a class of German officer brought up in a strict
Prussian boarding-school tradition, and they had all these repressed
homoerotic feelings. Fundamental to their outlook on the world was a
hatred of women, whom they saw as capable of softening them up and
threatening their morality.
The other book I'm trying to read a few pages of each night is Eric
Hobsbaum's Age of Extremes. It's a brilliant history of the twentieth
century. These kind of books are important to me. They help in my
understanding of the world, what's shaped it, the forces that work in
the world both in the past and the present.
It helps me to build up a picture of the world I'm living in, and
helps me respond to that and channel any reflections that I have myself,
into my work.

There's still an awful lot of people out there who want to escape . .
. but it's no longer into the realm of spies or cowboys, it's into a
whole new world altogether. Boldly sharpening his ears and splitting his
infinitives, Joe Donnelly explores the strange world of the fantasy
shops
THERE are aliens out there, no kidding. I've seen dragons and
unicorns, not a drink taken. Dropped into a black hole and come up
smiling; boldly split an infinitive and explored strange new places and
met some pretty strange people.
To the aliens, add Vulcans, Venusians, flying saucers and little green
men, big black creatures with yards of spiky teeth, odd folk who
actually think logically.
They've invaded Planet Earth, and we've welcomed them like brothers.
This in a country where Pape won't walk in step with Prod; where Tory
and Trot would swing for each other; where UFO is shorthand for
something cooler than the warmest welcome.
We've discovered Xeno-PHILIA, a deep and abiding love of the outsider.
Strange is now super, alien is adorable. Different is now a downright
delight. We might still hate each other down at ground level, but if the
next visitor is from outer space, or the outer reaches of the
imagination, he's the berries.
We are talking Anorak Country, and not the icy wastes of the Far North
where the Inuit invented the garment. This is Planet Sad, the
never-never land where grown-ups go when they realise they've made a big
mistake and want to go back.
This writer admits to being SAD. Spellbound, Astonished, Dumfounded.
It's a Spatially Affected Disorder. There may be no cure. There are a
lot of us about, and that's why there are more and more odd little
places, imagination safe-havens, to cater to our needs. After Dickens,
these are New Curiosity Shops, and they are where people go to forget
the present, imagine an exciting future populated with brothers from Out
There, and get some feel-good factor of their own.
Frank Griffin is such a pedlar of dreams. He stopped the world and
stepped off-planet when he sold the family pub near the King's Theatre
in Glasgow and opened up Starchasers in Great Western Road. That's where
the Black Hole is, the only one of its kind in this sector, or within
parsecs, depending on one's navigational co-ordinates.
This is where you can see a real, old-fashioned futuristic lava lamp,
the kind that impressed those of us of that certain age when we saw
Patrick McGoohan as The Prisoner first time round. Some of us got them
in wedding presents and slung them out at the first opportunity when the
novelty wore off. If we wanted to see floating globules of oil, sure,
we'd go down to the English Channel and watch the Torrey Canyon breaking
apart.
Now the novelty has returned. Our past is now our future, because lava
lamps are just part of the sci-fi fantasy myth, and Frank Griffin's shop
is just one of the many places to go for a myth-fit.
''Walt Disney said there's a child buried deep within all of us, and
it's true,'' Frank says. Born in Edinburgh, moved to New York and back
again, he now has a mid-Atlantic accent and he loves to talk. He'll chat
about fantasy, science fiction, science fact, the paranormal. He'll
demonstrate kaleidoscopes and stereographs, crystal spheres and
holograms.
''People are just fed up with today,'' he says. ''They want something
more than the humdrum existence that has become the norm. There's not
much fun out there and naturally people want a bit of adventure, even if
it's only in their imagination.''
In Starchasers you can buy a model of the USS Enterprise flight deck.
You can buy a dragon hatching from an egg, a magic, shimmering crystal,
a laser-etched hologram of a dinosaur or a perpetual motion toy. If you
want, you can buy a little gismo that lets you see the world the way a
bug-eyed monster sees it. There's a darkened room, known as the Black
Hole, one of only two in Scotland -- for Frank, his sister Moira and
fiancee Alison have branched out to new premises in the Sauchiehall
Centre. In the Black Hole, you can see lava lamps in action, or
fibre-optics like exotic anemone creatures, luminous ghosts and all
kinds of optical effects straight out of science fiction.
''You can always spot people who have been here before, because they
always drag the newcomer into the Black Hole and everybody comes out
smiling in amazement. This isn't work. It's getting to play all day,
with the kind of things I've been interested in and collected all my
life.
''It's coming up to the year 2000. We have Star Trek and Star Wars and
all these discovery channels. People are interested in space and the
future in a way they have never been since the sixties. The kind of
people who come to the shop still have a bit of the child in them and
they are not afraid to show it.
''People need some basic magic in their lives, some fantasy. They are
not ashamed to believe in UFOs or aliens, or life on other planets. They
actually want to believe in them.
''It's maybe because the feel-good factor is missing. People want
peace and harmony. They want an end to the bad-attitude society, and
they believe the future must be better and brighter than it is today.''
A modern version of cargo worship, waiting for the big shiny space
ship to bring home the goodies.
Such is the attraction of the fantastic or the futuristic that
Starchasers even has a Christmas Club to enable addicts to buy their
more expensive collectors' items on something like the never-never in
reverse.
For the upsurge of interest in the weird and wonderful, we can blame
Verne, Wells, Arthur Clark, and Bradbury for the sci-fi, and more
recently, Lucas, Spielberg, and Roddenberry. We can also blame Tolkien
for the fantasy, along with Homer, the Greek mythmakers, and the Nordic
saga-tellers.
Here there be dragons, creatures of legend. People want to own one,
even if just to put it on a mantelpiece for luck.
''We've got plenty of dragons, and lots of wizards,'' says Andrew
Maloney in Aberdeen. ''We've got aliens, predators, orcs, and hobbits,
the lot; plus all things Trekky.''
The loons have gone loopy for the lunar and even the quines have
turned quirky. Plan Nine, a fantasy shop on Rosemount Viaduct, is where
you go if you have an overwhelming compulsion to own pointed Vulcan
ears, or if Klingon paraphernalia is your thing.
Andrew has been running Plan Nine since he was 16, having borrowed the
blast-off money from his mum. The shop is named after a particularly bad
movie starring Bela Lugosi, who died during filming. Andrew says they
completed the film with a completely different actor, but such is the
suspension of disbelief required in a fantasy world, who cares?
''We do lots of Star Trek stuff, T-shirts, posters, replica uniforms
and Spock ears,'' Andrew proffers. ''We can get you a phaser if you want
one. There's a big demand. People come from all over the north of
Scotland just to see what we've got. Families even travel down from
Shetland. They love it here.''
Plan Nine sells US comics Superman, Batman, Fantastic Four, plus some
home-grown glossies including AD 2000, a popular future-shock mag
featuring Judge Joe Dredd, an interestingly dour lawman soon to make the
transition to the silver screen.
''It's all escapism,'' Andrew explains. ''People today don't want to
escape into spy novels any more. They want to get right out of this
world. They want to believe in creatures from space, in dungeons and
dragons, in ghosts and the paranormal. Shops like ours give people a
little bit of the escapism they need.
''Here they can be themselves, and they can keep a hold of their
dreams.''
Sammy Cooper of 23 Enigma (the odder the name the more acceptable to
us escapists, who should have been christened Skywalker or Ben Kenobi)
says her shop's title is based on the historically mystic Law of Twenty
Three. Fair enough.
She's 25 and has recently opened doors in Glasgow's High Street. Here
one can buy audio tapes in conversational Klingon, mugs in the shape of
Leonard Nimoy's head, scary masks of Ridley Scott's Alien creature.
Sammy, from Aberdeen, says: ''The Trek is big. The Next Generation is
huge. And the X-Files are coming up fast, thanks to a lot of hype and
the release of the book. Babylon 5 is just too cheesy.''
Not Klingon, just the in-speak for what's high on the Galactic scale
at the moment. Kirk and Spock just can't fail.
''We are selling to the little boy,'' says Sammy, ''no matter what age
he is, or even what sex. We have old women come in to buy
glow-in-the-dark T-shirts or Trek phasers. All the space stuff spans the
generations. Everybody, it seems, has an imagination and they're not
afraid to let people know it.
''They want some magic in their lives, and when you look at the world
today, who can blame them? It's such a dismal and dull place, and people
need fun and adventure. They can get some here, just a little maybe, but
they can come in and imagine and lose themselves for a while.
''There's no harm in believing in all this. It's the least harmful
religion in the world.''
Alistair Boyd, manager of Forbidden Planet in Buchanan Street, one of
several stores in the company chain, will sell you a 5ft by 6ft replica
of the Starship Enterprise for those who really want to boldly go.
''It costs #2000, but we have had a number of serious inquiries,'' he
said. ''People take their Star Trek seriously. The power of imagination
is stronger than some people might believe.''
Alistair says that the superheroes of yore are still very big
sales-wise, including Spidey, Superman, Batman, the X-men.
''They're all going strong, still alive and well since the fifties.
People still believe in the old heroes the way they believe in James T
Kirk and his crew. We sell books and magazines, science fiction,
fantasy, tales of mystery and imagination and there's always a demand.''
A reflection of the drab dullness of society maybe. A lot of Sad
Anoraks perhaps.
Yet in an age where the veneer of true civilisation seems at times to
be alarmingly thin, and when the veneer of innocence is rubbed off at an
ever earlier age, it is perhaps no bad thing to wish for a new age of
innocence and hark for tales of adventure and derring-do where moral
might is always right.
When big business and banks, the once unfailing pillars of our
society, seem to be crumbling at the edges, these curiosity shops which
deal in dreams and fantasia are proliferating. It is a message that
something must be out of kilter when people really want to believe in
dragons and monsters; when they would prefer green men from outer space.
What they are really saying is: ''Beam me up, Scottie.''
And when you look around, who can blame us?

LIFE is hectic for Kenneth Sandford, Deacon Convener of the Trades of
Glasgow, and the city's third citizen.
He started on Thursday by opening the Trades House first annual
student craft competition and exhibition in the Trades Hall in Glassford
Street.
Immediately after the opening ceremony Sandford, who is chairman of
Cambusnethan Confectionery, hot footed it down the motorway, watching
his speed he tells me, to Sheffield where he was representing the
Glasgow Trades at the Cutlers' Feast, organised by the Master Cutlers of
Sheffield. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was the main
speaker.
Yesterday morning he was up and on his way back up the motorway by 7am
to represent the Trades at a reception for the Flag Officer for
Scotland.
After that he returned to Trades Hall to present the first Trades
House craft gold medal to student Marian Kane and host a reception for
200 guests.
Today, he has the pleasant task of presenting a #19,000 cheque to
Action Research at a reception in the City Chambers.
Anyone whose diary is not so full may like to pop into Trades House
today to see the craft work produced by Cardonald College students. The
exhibition is being supported by Glasgow Development Agency, and several
companies including ScottishPower, The Howden Group and CR Smith have
sponsored different categories.
The exhibition closes today and many of the items on display are for
sale.
Tricky figures of speech
THE Scottish Stock Exchange had its annual conference in the Sheraton
Hotel in Edinburgh earlier this week at which Tony Vine-Lott of Barclays
Stockbrokers handed over the chairmanship to Bernard Solomons, chairman
of Allied Provincial Securities, who will hold the position for two
years.
Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,
attended the conference and dinner in the evening along with Collette
Bowe, chief executive of the PIA.
It seems some brokers attending the conference were getting rather
tongue tied, with utterances such as ''the dog wagging the tail'' and
''a silver lining at the end of the tunnel'' being heard. Just as well
that settlements are now done electronically and not verbally on the
floor otherwise there might be some strange deals completed.
Going for broke in Glasgow
STILL on the subject of stockbrokers, the Association of Private
Client Investment Managers is holding its annual conference at the
Glasgow Hilton next Saturday.
More than 400 brokers from throughout the UK are expected to attend
and Labour MP Alistair Darling will be addressing the assembled throng,
as will Jack Shaw, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Scotland. The brokers
will also be attending a civic reception at the Burrell Collection
during their short stay in the city.
Careless first impression
THE South-east of England company First Impressions certainly made an
impression with Made in Scotland when it sent correspondence addressed
to Made in England.
The postie in Beauly where Made in Scotland is based certainly has a
sense of humour as he marked on the envelope: ''Not quite right''.
Kathleen Hardie, managing director of Made in Scotland which is the
promotion and marketing organisation for the craft and gift industry,
said: ''They certainly made an impression on us as we have been called
many things in the past, but no-one has gone this far before.''
Angels flock to Stirling
ON Tuesday evening two companies will be faced with around 30 business
angels and will have the unenviable task of trying to convince them that
they should put their hands in their pockets, take out their cheque
books and invest some money.
The meeting has been arranged by LINC Scotland in the Business
Management Centre of Stirling University, and LINC director David
Grahame is hoping by the end of the evening to have succeeded in
bringing together business ideas and people with cash to invest in them.
In the past year LINC has succeeded in introducing 17 business angels
to companies, leading to the investment of #1.6m, creating more than 200
new jobs and safeguarding another 200. David Grahame told Business Diary
that the money invested by business angels had also unlocked a further
#6m from other sources.
Dreaming of a better future
SLEEPING on the job is normally a sackable offence, but chartered
psychologist Ben Williams will be out to convince around 30 businessmen
and women that there are benefits to be gained from ''practical''
dreaming.
He will be delivering the lecture at a Business Ventures seminar at
its Octagon headquarters in Baird Street, Glasgow. The psychologist
assured Business Diary that practical dreaming was an ''extremely
powerful mind tool, when coupled with self belief''.
George Hammersley, chief executive of Business Ventures, was equally
convincing, saying: ''Business executives who develop greater
self-knowledge are better businessmen and women. In business, as in
anything else, mental attitude is extremely important.'' By this point I
was convinced of the merits of the case . . . zzzzz.
Motorbikes are the business
PETE Fletcher, owner of Portfolio Design, and his friend Jimmy
Stewart, boss of Print 2000, are heading off next week to see Fletcher's
daughter Holly graduate from Ithaca University.
Their arrival at the American seat of learning should certainly make
some heads turn as the Scottish businessmen will roll up on Harley
Davidson motorbikes. Fletcher is the proud owner of a Harley Davidson
Dyna Low Rider, which set him back a cool #10,000, but he is not taking
it over. Instead, the pair will be hiring bikes to ride the 500 miles
through the Catskill mountains to Ithaca.
After the graduation ceremony he reckons they will mosey up to Niagara
Falls before returing to Boston for their flight home to Glasgow.
Shop around for free advice
GLASGOW Chamber of Commerce now has a direct line dedicated to
Business Shop enquiries which is open to everyone whether or not they
are members of the chamber.
The number is 0141 204 8300 and enquiries are free. The chamber is one
of the managing partners in the Glasgow Business Shop along with Glasgow
City Council, Strathclyde Region and the Glasgow Development Agency.
The shop's aim is to improve the quality and range of information
available to businesses and to co-ordinate the various services,
including a database on grants and loans, which are available.
Guess who isn't coming to dinner
PROFESSOR Ross Harper's heart gave a little flutter when he was
invited, as president of the International Bar Association, to address a
joint dinner with the American Bar Association to celebrate the United
Nations' 50th anniversary.
He spotted that Bill Clinton was the association's honorary chairman,
and for a moment he thought he would be sharing the top table with
America's president.
''Before I was able to brag too much about keeping such distinguished
company, I discovered that in America the words honorary chairman really
means absentee chairman. President Clinton will be with us in spirit,
but unhappily not in person.''
Accountants opt to go Dutch
THE president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland,
Nial Lothian, and chief executive Peter Johnston are in Amsterdam this
weekend taking part in the centenary celebrations of the Dutch Institute
of Chartered Accountants.
The Dutch institute decided to mark its centenary by establishing a
school in Albania for under-privileged children, and as a birthday
present ICAS has decided to make a sizeable donation.
Bird's eye view of wildlife
IF you fancy going along to Edinburgh District Council's Festival of
the Environment event at the Assembly Rooms on Thursday at 7.30pm, give
the Tods Murray environmental lecture ticketline a call on 0131 529
3113.
Ex-Goodie Bill Oddie is the guest speaker at the lecture which the
firm is sponsoring and tickets are free. The comedian turned bird
watcher and conservationist will give a ''bird's eye'' view of the
world's diverse wildlife.

IN less than six months since it started, the National Lottery has
already found itself with a staggering #17m in unclaimed prizes. And it
is not the only organisation sitting on cash which has been neglected by
its rightful owners. Many financial institutions from investment trust
companies to building societies have money waiting to be paid out to
investors or languishing in obsolete accounts.
Most of the unclaimed lottery prizes are the small #10 wins you get
when you match three of the numbers in the weekly draw. It seems many
people have focused on winning the jackpot and are unaware that anything
less than all six numbers qualifies them for a prize. The largest
outstanding prize of over #300,000 was won on Christmas Eve by someone
who got five and the bonus number correct.
The problem is that no lottery prize can be claimed unless you have
the original receipt. So if you don't happen to have kept your old ones
lying around, you can't go to your local shop owner and ask him or her
to swipe them through the computer to check if you have won anything in
the past. After six months all unclaimed Lottery prizes will go into the
charity fund for distribution to deserving causes.
Fortunately, with most other sorts of unclaimed or neglected cash you
have longer to do something about it. Even if the relevant documentation
has been lost or destroyed you may still be able to prove your rightful
ownership or make a claim if an elderly relative has died without
sorting out their affairs.
Many investors are losing out though, due to simple apathy. Those
using building societies are some of the worst culprits. Many have left
their money in ''closed'' accounts which pay abysmally low rates of
interest. The Consumers' Association has estimated that 20 million
building society savers are losing #800m in interest a year because they
have failed to switch their savings from obsolete to new accounts.
Societies have made a practice of opening ''improved'' accounts in
recent years to attract new savers. Existing ones are closed and the
rates paid gradually drift down. Differentials of 2% or more have opened
up between old and new accounts even when the terms are very similar.
Recent research shows that among the larger societies the Halifax has
10 closed accounts, the Woolwich 14, Bradford and Bingley 20, with
Northern Rock outstripping the lot with a tally of more than 30.
Holders of matured National Savings Certificates are also letting
money slip through their fingers. Over #1500m is currently earning the
general extension rate of 3.51% or less, when the going rate for new
certificates is 5.85%. This also includes holders of index-linked
certificates, which are typically only earning inflation returns after
they run their five-year term, and not the 3% annual bonus being given
on the current index-linked issue.
Also sitting in National Savings coffers is some #12m in unclaimed
premium bond prizes. According to the department, missing claimants have
usually moved house and failed to keep the bond office informed of their
whereabouts.
Insurance companies have similar problems when life policies come to
maturity. David Atkinson of Scottish Amicable, which has #20m of
insurance payouts looking for a home, says: ''The main reason we haven't
been able to pay out this money is because policyholders have moved and
left no forwarding address.''
The latest issue of Investment Trust magazine also looks into the
subject of unclaimed investment trust dividends, which it suggests
amount to more than #2m in total across the industry. This seems to be a
conservative estimate, though -- Glasgow-based manager Murray Johnstone
alone revealed that it had over #300,000 in unclaimed dividends.
Though not as fast to find other uses for your money as the National
Lottery, investment trusts do not have to sit on such unclaimed
dividends forever. While individual trusts have different provisions,
the general position under The Companies Act is that they can take back
unclaimed dividends after 12 years. Meanwhile, the money is kept on ice
and does not earn any interest.
The moral of this story for investors is that they should be sure to
carry out periodic checks on their investments. Ensure your bank and
building society savings are earning the best possible returns in the
most up-to-date accounts, and if you have moved home in the past, check
that you have informed all the relevant institutions. Encourage elderly
relatives to do the same.
If you have lost policy documents or other written proof of ownership,
or have good reason to believe a relative had certain savings or
insurance policies but cannot find the evidence, you should write to the
institutions concerned giving as much detail as you can. Ask if they
have unclaimed funds on their books in that name.
An increasing problem in future will be tracking down old pensions if
you have worked for a number of different employers and failed to keep
in touch. However, in this case there is a central registry that could
provide you with information.
In the meantime, why not go through your pockets or handbag to see if
you have any old lottery slips. If you have, take them along to your
local dealer -- you may find you have a few pounds of winnings to
collect.

FLORA MACDONALD:
The Jacobite heroine in Scotland
and North America
Ruaridh H Macleod
Shepheard-Walwyn, #9.95 pbk
FLORA Macdonald is still a household name. Even in the quiz shows and
comedy sketches of popular culture, her name is cited in confident
expectation that everyone will know she was the woman who aided Bonnie
Prince Charlie's escape after Culloden by disguising him as her Irish
maid ''Betty Burke''. A good scholarly biography was overdue, and this
Ruaridh Macleod has provided. He adds to our knowledge with careful
research done in archives in Scotland and North America.
The North American aspect of the Flora MacDonald story is the least
known. In 1750 she married Allan MacDonald of Kingsburgh -- yet another
of those ambitious entrepreneurs whose dreams outran his acumen and
talents. Forced to emigrate to America after the failure of his
cattle-dealing business, Allan and Flora settled in North Carolina in
1774, but a year later were sucked into the vortex of the American War
of Independence.
Once again Flora was on the losing side, since Allan remained loyal to
King George and raised a regiment of Highlanders. Alas, Allan was no
better as soldier than as businessman, and was defeated and imprisoned.
Released in 1777, he took Flora to New York and Nova Scotia as part of
his itinerant and increasingly aimless career as an adventurer. Finally,
the seriously ill Flora returned to Skye, where she died in 1790.
Cynics claim that Flora MacDonald was a nonentity, neither pretty nor
intelligent, who achieved fame simply by ''being there''. But the more
generous will agree with Dr Johnson that hers was ''a name that will be
mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned
with honour''.

I am being made redundant this summer with a pension estimated at
#13,400 a year and a lump sum of about #45,000. I still have a mortgage
of #53,000, which is not due to be paid off until 2002 when my endowment
policies mature. Fortunately, I inherited a substantial sum from my
mother in 1986 and this has now grown to #170,000. It is invested in
shares and investment trusts, but the income from it is only #3000 after
tax.
I now need to rearrange my finances to take account of my reduced
financial circumstances. My wife makes nearly #80 a week from her
part-time job, but my chances of picking up fresh employment are
limited. Your advice on ways in which I can use my lump sum and
investments to generate extra income would be appreciated along with
guidance on advisers I should consult.
* Your mortgage is costing you more than #300 a month, and the most
obvious course of action is to use your lump sum to pay off the bulk of
this so it is no longer a drain on your finances. At the very least you
should reduce your mortgage to #30,000, the ceiling for tax relief, but
as this is of diminishing benefit there is a strong case for paying off
as much as possible.
Your share portfolio could be rearranged to produce a much higher
income. It is yielding just 2.2% gross, exceptionally low in the
circumstances and little more than half the market average.
You should consult a good stockbroker to advise you on the changes
that you need to make in your investments. You would benefit from
allocating a significant proportion of your funds to gilts, currently
yielding more than 8%, and introducing a spread of higher yielding
equities to your portfolio. There should be no great difficulty in more
than doubling the income you receive.
There may well be substantial unrealised capital gains in your
portfolio. To avoid having to pay tax on these it may be necessary to
spread the planned changes over a period. It will be much easier to get
round such a problem if your investments are held jointly with your wife
since you each enjoy an annual capital gains tax exemption limit.
The situation would also have been helped if you had been switching
funds into PEPs. Together you and your wife could shelter #18,000 a year
from taxes on capital gains and dividend income by taking maximum
advantage of general and single company PEPs, and this should now become
an important part of your investment strategy.
If you repay your mortgage in full you will have to decide whether you
wish to continue paying your endowment policy premiums until maturity,
when you would receive a substantial sum to add to your investments. If
you would rather not make this outlay, your best course would probably
be to leave the policies paid up until maturity when, of course, the
return would be much less.
If you do not have a stockbroker you can obtain a list from the Stock
Exchange in Glasgow from which you can select. The advice of an
independent financial intermediary should be sought on your endowment
policies.

She may not act like the queen bee but Linda La Plante's home is
always a hive of activity. She just has to keep on working and producing
her hard-hitting and insightful dramas. Otherwise, as she explains to
Julia Langdon, she'd be horribly bored
SOMETHING has to be done about the bees, says Lynda La Plante as she
arrives, and it has to be done today. She hands her assistant a letter
about pest control and mutters about more people being stung, she can't
stand it any longer, it must be organised. ''Where does one get a queen
bee?'' she asks me, looking extremely puzzled.
Lynda La Plante is one of those people to whom things always happen.
Today it is bees. In fact, if she is to be believed she has had a swarm
of bees in her chimney for five years. Once she came into a room to find
the carpet moving with bees, but apparently they are a protected
species, or something, and one is not allowed to kill them. She has had
enough, but so far everything that has been tried to move them has been
unsuccessful. Her house has been swarming with bee-keepers. Now an
artificial hive is to be constructed, a queen bee introduced into it and
thus the swarm moved. That is the idea, anyway. It is going to cost
hundreds of pounds.
It would be an exaggeration to say that she makes a drama out of this,
but she makes it interesting and funny. I burst out laughing when I see
that she is wearing golden bee earrings. She hoots with mirth in reply
and describes the day when her husband walked into the room, found her
with her hands full of insecticide sprays, and presented her with them.
Perhaps it is not that she is someone to whom things happen, but,
rather, someone who makes everything that happens more entertaining than
it would otherwise be.
We are here, in her company offices in the middle of London, as part
of the agreed publicity exercise for her forthcoming new drama series
The Governor. But before we get anywhere near discussing that we have
done adoption, infertility, child care, the Oklahoma bombing -- why
there were so many little babies in the building? -- and her own longing
for a child.
She relates, hilariously, the circumstances in which she learned, at
31, that she would never have a baby of her own. Although it is tragic,
not funny at all, she has an extraordinary gift for making light of an
immensely serious issue while at the same time extracting and
emphasising the dramatic and tragic points of the episode. This must
have something to do with the skills of a dramatist. ''You don't want to
write about this,'' she says. She has always been open about the subject
and thus it has been fully aired. But the way she tells this story is
very indicative of the woman.
She had been undergoing fertility treatment (here a diversion for an
uproarious account of other patients, notably the woman whose problems
came down to having a husband on nights who didn't ''do it''). She had
also been having problems at home with her central heating over-heating,
despite protestations from experts that the plumbing was all working
properly. Then came an appointment with a consultant who told her she
was too late. (''Too late! You mean you can't see me now? Why not, I'm
here?'') Too late, he says, because she has already started the
menopause, apparently as a side-effect of heavy fertility treatments. So
that was why it was always so hot at home. That was the problem with the
plumbing.
She went off home, relieved that her own hot flushes had solved the
mystery, and it was only halfway there that the full implication hit
her. She turned round and went back. She demanded to see him again. She
got her way. She discovered that the condition could not be reversed.
And she told that consultant that he was never ever, not ever, to tell
another woman in similar circumstances that piece of news in the same
casual, callous way. Let us hope that he heeded her.
All this was years ago. Her writing career took off at about that
point with her series Widows and there were always a lot of other things
to do. ''Quite truthfully'' -- she says this a lot, quite relevantly
because she is very keen on truth and reality -- she is not sure that
she could have managed both. Everyone always goes on about how
productive she is, and she acknowledges that she works the most
extraordinary hours, ''but what else have I got to be productive
about?'' she asks. This is not a question posed in a way that is
remotely pathetic and, in any case, she is still planning to try for
adoption in the United States.
Her assistant has already told me that her faxes are often timed 3am.
She has an astonishing schedule. Up at 6am, walk the dogs, writing by
8am, first coffee break to assess overnight faxes from the States at
9am. A break for lunch and sometimes a swim and a break for dinner at
8pm. If her husband is away she won't bother about the dinner break but
a bottle (preferably of red wine) will be opened about that time. We
never got round to when she stops; the impression is that she doesn't.
This then is how she has arrived at her current celebrity and the
incredible list of work in progress. She has just had a series on
television called She's Out. The new one, The Governor, starring Janet
McAteer, starts tomorrow and is the first production of her own company,
La Plante Productions. She has written it, but for the first time she
has also produced it herself. Her last novel, Cold Shoulder, is about to
appear in paperback and she has written TV tie-in books for She's Out
and The Governor. The new TV series of Prime Suspect, with which people
still identify her name, is no longer anything to do with her. She sold
the name and characters to Granada -- but she is still writing a film of
it for Hollywood.
She is also writing another film, for MGM, about nuclear supercrooks
in Moscow -- although with some difficulty, one gathers, because of
Hollywood methods. Too many people, too many conferences, too little
progress. She has the germ of an idea about something on computer fraud
and theft.
She is also writing a mini-series for CBS in the US based on her novel
Bella Mafia, and she is writing a new novel Cold Shoulder II. I look at
her questioningly to see if that is really the title. She grins
disarmingly: ''No need to beat about the bush.'' Another new series,
Supply and Demand, about drug-dealing goes into production later this
year and she is also researching a film for Channel Four -- Manchester
Blue, based on a novel by Eddy Shah.
''I like to move from one project into another,'' she says. Sometimes
she is bored with one, or doesn't feel like it, so she does something
else. She has plenty from which to choose. She is gradually turning down
commissions of other people's work because it remains theirs: she feels
very strongly about how writers are used and abused in film production
and that is why she has started her own production company. It is not
power or megalomania; it is a desire to nurture her own work.
I wondered how she was happiest. ''Truthfully? Lying on a sunbed doing
bugger-all.'' She throws back her head and shouts with laughter, but she
doesn't really mean it: a minute later she admits that she would get
horribly bored with nothing to do. As it is she reads avidly, watches
videos and tapes everything new on the telly. Goodness only knows when.
What drives her? Is it money? It seems not. It doesn't really matter
to her, she says. The day she will say she is wealthy is when she has
paid off her mortgage. She is putting her money into running her office,
a full-time editor, a full-time researcher, a P A and manager -- all
women ''and all very tall''. She has endowed a scholarship for young
writers at Liverpool University -- in her home city -- and a bursary for
women writers among a group of ex-prisoners.
There is a lot of laughter and merriment in this discussion but this
could be misleading. In fact, as she says herself, she takes things very
very seriously. She has a profound sense of morality which she wishes to
convey -- when she killed off her character Dolly Rawlins in She's Out,
a woman who was something of an icon for other working-class women, it
was because she had pulled an armed robbery, using shotguns, putting
other people's lives at risk. ''Therefore she must take the
responsibility for a criminal act.''
Lynda La Plante does not, however, extract a political message. She
may work in prisons -- for example, with The Governor for which she was
given the full co-operation of the prisons system -- but that does not
give her the right to pronounce on the system, she says. The new series
is a hard, violent drama but it shows both sides: there is nothing in it
that has not happened in a British prison -- including an audacious
helicopter escape.
It will not do anything to improve the image of the system. She ticks
off the facts: there are 55,000 men in prison now; there will be
70,000-80,000 within two years. Children of 12 are being accused of
manslaughter, armed robbery, drug-dealing. Prison takes criminals off
the streets but does not rehabilitate them; it has something of the
opposite effect.
''It isn't working, is it?'' she says shrugging. ''But I have no
answer. I'm not giving any form of political message. It's my voice but
I'm using everything I saw and heard, everything is put down.'' She
compares herself to a competitor in one of those game shows who sees 57
different objects and then has to look away and remember as many of them
as possible. She is very serious about this: if one was being flippant
one could say that she had a bee under her bonnet, but we are passed all
that levity.
''If you had said to me when I was 25 and an actress that I would be
writing a drama series about prisons, I would have laughed at you. Me
write? I'm dyslexic -- despite which I'd always written since I was
five. But I'd never have expected the rage. I never expected such black
causes and anger and injustice and how appallingly the victims of crime
are treated . . . '' Our time is up. Someone else is waiting. Oddly, she
stops in mid-sentence, raises her hand and slips from the room.
She doesn't even say goodbye.

* I have almost finished my first year at Glasgow University and am
looking ahead to summer employment. Friends have advised me that I will
be exempt from income tax, but I know that other students have paid tax
on summer earnings and have had to reclaim this from the tax office. Is
there a correct procedure which should be followed so that this can be
avoided?
* The question of whether you are liable to tax will depend on the
level of your earnings plus any other income you may have. You are
entitled to the personal tax allowance which for 1995/96 is #3525. If
your total taxable income for the year including earnings, unemployment
benefit claimed and investment income is less than the tax allowance you
can ask your employer for a P38(S) form which you should complete, sign
and hand back to him or her. Your earnings should then be paid without
tax being deducted.
If, however, your total income will exceed the tax allowance you will
be liable to pay tax on the excess and you should not complete the
P38(S). In these circumstances you should advise the tax office at the
end of the year of your total income and tax deductions so that any
adjustment required can be made.
There is further information available to students in the Inland
Revenue leaflet number IR60.
* I am now aged 76 and over the years have managed to accumulate about
#20,000 invested in building society accounts and a portfolio of shares
which produce dividend income. Taking those into account and my old age
pension, my total gross income is just over #8000 a year and usually I
receive a rebate of tax at the end of the year. This being the case, is
it possible to register my building society deposits as non-taxable so
that I can avoid the need to make an annual tax claim?
* You receive a tax repayment as the higher age allowance to which you
are entitled exceeds your retirement pension which is your only source
of untaxed income. The excess allowances and reduced rate income tax
band are utilised against your investment income which has been taxed at
the basic rate and part of this tax is repaid to you.
Your allowances, however, are not sufficient to reduce your tax
liability to nil and you are still, therefore, a taxpayer. Because of
this it is not possible to register any of your building society
accounts to receive gross interest and you must continue to make a
repayment claim. This can be done as soon as the final amount of
investment income for the year is received and you can declare to the
Inspector that no further income will be received in the tax year.
* You have regularly mentioned in answers about inheritance tax that
everyone has an annual entitlement to an exemption of #3000. But is it
not the case that there is a restriction which limits the amount gifted
to each person to #250 a year, after which inheritance tax applies?
* In addition to the annual inheritance tax exemption of #3000 there
is also a separate small gifts exemption of #250. This allows #250 to be
given to any number of individuals each year with no liability to IHT
and without eating into the annual exemption of #3000.
The small gifts exemption cannot, however, be used against part of a
larger gift. For example, a present of #3250 could not be covered by the
annual and small gifts exemptions together. The idea behind the
exemption is really one of administrative convenience and is intended to
remove from taxation birthday, Christmas and similar types of gifts.
* I took voluntary redundancy almost two years ago and made the
following investments on the advice of an independent financial adviser
hired by my employer: #6000 PEP (Gartmore High Income), #6000 PEP
(Newton Income), #20,000 Sun Alliance distribution bond and #31,000 in a
building society postal account. One PEP and the distribution bond are
in my wife's name.
We do not need income from the PEPs and since I am now employed have
no need of income from the distribution bond or postal account. As
neither the PEPs nor the distribution bond are exactly over-performing I
would like to know which is the best course of action.
Should we leave the income from the bond where it is or take it and
invest it in the postal account? What happens to the income from the
bond if we do not take it as income?
* It would be worth your while re-shaping your portfolio to suit your
current circumstances better. Assuming you are still some way off
retirement, you should invest more for capital growth for when that day
comes. The existing PEPs can be left in place as they are reasonable
performers, though the income they produce will have to be reinvested
elsewhere.
You and your wife should put #6000 each into another PEP, for example
that belonging to the Alliance Trust, which, after the first #1500 in
Alliance itself, allows the investor to choose from a wide range of
investment trusts and there are no PEP charges. More could be placed in
investment trusts outside PEPs. A stockbroker will be able to advise on
the best ones to suit your needs.
The Sun Alliance bond has not been a bad performer in its class, but
you may prefer to shift at least part of it into more capital growth
oriented investments, depending on how far off retirement you are. The
income from the bond can always be reinvested for the time being if you
prefer.

THE 1995 Finance Act (all 380 pages of it) received Royal Assent last
week. It contains a number of bright spots for the individal that are
worth considering.
Reinvestment relief
This is available where a capital gain is realised on the disposal of
any asset and reinvestment made in an unquoted trading company.
Providing you reinvest some or all of the chargeable gain element of the
proceeds in a qualifying company, you can deduct the gain from the cost
of the shares, effectively deferring payment of capital gains tax until
you dispose of them.
There are some restrictions on the companies qualifying for
reinvestment relief purposes and up to November 29 1994 not more than
half the company's own assets could be invested in land. Certain trades
are also ineligible. However, from that date farming and property
development companies become eligible.
The original restrictive legislation meant qualifying trading
companies would have been inherently risky investments. However, the
relaxation of the legislation permitting the inclusion of
property-backed ventures should improve the position.
Enterprise investment
Reinvestment relief has also been extended to sales of assets on or
after November 29 1994 where the chargeable gain element of the proceeds
is wholly or partly invested in a company which qualifies under the
Enterprise Investment scheme. This is an addition to the existing income
tax relief of 20% currently available for investments under the scheme,
making a possible tax deduction of up to 60%.
Investment in the scheme is still restricted to #100,000 a year, but
the benefit of reinvestment relief can be maximised by investing in non
EIS companies.
The Act has also withdrawn the restriction on the proportion of the
EIS company's assets invested in land (broadly 50%) again making it more
attractive.
Venture capital trusts
These trusts were heralded in the 1994 Act and some further proposals
were included this time round. Sponsors are now able to bring them to
the market. The intention of these trusts is to generate investment in
the unquoted trading sector.
Individuals will in this way be able to subscribe to a spread of
unquoted companies. The limit for any individual will be #100,000 in any
tax year. Those who subscribe for new Ordinary shares in a venture
capital trust will be entitled to income tax relief at 20% provided they
are held for at least five years.
As with the rules for Enterprise Investment schemes, investors will be
able to defer capital gains tax on the disposal of any assets where the
gain is reinvested by subscription to a venture capital trust. Where
both reliefs apply, an investor may qualify for total initial tax relief
of up to 60%.
Follow up Tessas
Tessa accounts are offered by most banks and building societies and
interest earned is tax-free provided the capital is not drawn for the
five-year term. Only one Tessa per person is allowed and investors must
be over 18. The maximum investment over the five years is #9000. The
first of them mature in January.
The new Act enables those with maturing Tessas to roll over the whole
capital (but not interest) to a new one. Investors who want to do this
will need to open their second Tessa within six months of the maturity
of their original one.
Personal pensions
Before the new Act an annuity had to be purchased by a personal
pension fund when any benefit was taken from the fund.
Now personal pension scheme members can choose to defer purchase
(until not later than age 75) and will be able to make income
withdrawals in the deferral period equivalent to a minimum of 35% and a
maximum of 100% of the annuity which their fund could have provided.
Income withdrawal levels will be reviewed every three years to ensure
the fund is not too rapidly depleted. The balance will continue to build
up tax free during the deferral period. This is a useful option if you
expect annuity rates to improve. There is, however, a sting in the tail.
If you die before drawing the deferred element of your pension, any lump
sum refunded to your estate will suffer a 35% tax charge.
Income tax
Don't forget that the majority of income tax allowances have been
increased for the first time since 1992/93. The personal allowance is
now #3525 (an increase of 2.3%).
The rate bands have also been increased with the first #3200 of income
being taxed at 20%, the next #21,100 at 25% and the balance at 40%. The
effect of the increased allowances and rates will have been visible in
April salaries. The increase in take home pay, although small, is better
than nothing.
Self-assessment
Finally, as we move even closer to self-assessment more regulations to
catch the unwary have been introduced. The time to seek professional
advice is fast approaching.

THE exotic smaller markets of the Far East and Latin America emerged
into the consciousness of Western investors in a big way a year or two
ago. Professionals had, of course, been aware of them and dabbling in
them for years. But it was not until comparatively recently that, with
the sweet smell of past successes hanging round them, they were packaged
for the smaller investors by the fund management industry and presented
with all the tempting artistry of a nouvelle cuisine chef.
The story was a convincing one. The Latin American countries had, well
most of them had, mended their ways at last, abandoned the rule of
dictatorship, got to grips with inflation and generally started to run
their affairs in a more encouraging way.
And in the Far East it was all go. The hard-working Asians were
abandoning the paddy-field image and making all sorts of things from
ships to cars and computers. Their fast growing economies had reached
the stage where they were no longer totally dependent on a prosperous
West for a market for their goods, but were trading between each other
and creating their own prosperity. For a while it looked as though they
would be able to withstand any gravitational pull which might come from
Western wobbles.
We all knew that these markets were liable to have some sharp downs as
well as ups, and it was recognised that they had and extra element of
risk in them. Most people saw these risks as being the possibility of
revolutions, political or financial scandals and so on. Last year,
however, we saw that rising interest rates and currency problems in the
major countries, plus a big problem in one of the markets classified as
emerging -- Mexico, for example -- can also have their knock-on effects
and pull prices down.
How do things look now? Mark White, investment director at Flemings
and Save &amp; Prosper, says: ''Emerging markets are calming down. There is
a much better tone in them now. Latin America has settled down. And the
tone in South-east Asia and eastern Europe has become much better.''
What has not settled down is the currency market where the yen, mark
and dollar are all in the spotlight. Sterling has been ''caught in the
crossfire and is much weaker than it ought to be -- because of its
historic association with the dollar''.
So should investors now be thinking again about emerging markets? Mr
White comments: ''It is always a good time when things are quiet and
relatively cheap. We are quite comfortable with emerging markets. We
like Asia and think India is tremendously interesting. We are hoping
that we can do more in India for UK investors.''
Flemings already has an investment trust specialising in India,
although this is still standing at below the price at which it was
launched just over a year ago. Despite that he says: ''We see tremendous
opportunites there.''
One problem for the investor in India has been settlement and the
clogging up of paperwork. That, says Mr White, is now getting better.
There are growing volumes on the screen-based national stock exchange,
and Bombay, still the most important market in India, is improving
although company registrars do not always act as quickly as the
international investor would like. Storage for the huge amount of
paperwork required was one difficulty encountered in the early days, but
''it is getting better, and anyway we have a bigger vault now''.
He would like to launch a unit trust for UK investors to take a stake
in India, but while investment trusts seem to have overcome the
technical difficulties of the taxation system this is less easy for a
unit trust.
Dr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer at Foreign &amp; Colonial's
Emerging Markets investment trust, whose main interests are in Latin
America and South-east Asia, comments that emerging markets have always
been fashionable, ''it is just the countries that have changed''.
Back in 1960, for instance, Japan was an emerging market. In the
eighties South-east Asian countries such as Taiwan, Korea and Thailand
made great strides. ''Now it is the Latin American countries that are in
the spotlight. Next it will be China and Russia,'' he says.
Russia, where Flemings was again an early arrival, opening up in 1991,
has not been a totally happy experience for the international investor.
The Fleming Russia Securities Fund, a closed-end investment company
listed in Dublin and launched last July, has fallen in value. But Mr
White, impressed with Russia's potential, believes there will be a
recovery. ''We are seriously considering portfolio investment in
Russia,'' he says.
Flemings has been successful with its wider-ranging Luxembourg-based
flagship east European venture. It has a small Russian content, perhaps
2%, but its price has risen 15% since its launch. Poland is Mr White's
favourite east European country and the fund has 43% of its investments
there. Next come the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Looking at the larger, developed markets he notes cautiously that the
US is already very high (some observers feel it could go higher still,
but a lot of fund managers worry that it might go in the wrong
direction), Japan has the problem of the strong yen and Germany a
similar difficulty with the mark.
On that basis he considers the UK market is currently the most
attractive of the larger ones. Looking around at home he feels
''reasonably positive without being euphoric''. The manufacturing sector
is doing well and he believes inflation will not be allowed to run away.
The market also seems to be discounting a Labour government, he notes,
although he adds that people, particularly those in the government
securities market where the Exchequer does a lot of its borrowing, will
be wanting to know how the party's policies will be paid for.
Investors seem spoilt for choice -- there is the prospect of solid
reliability at home, at least for a while, and the renewal of more
exciting but riskier temptations in far away places.

THE POETRY OF SCOTLAND: GAELIC, SCOTS AND ENGLISH 1380-1980
Roderick Watson, editor
Edinburgh University Press, #19.95
REMARKABLY few Scottish poets have made an impact outside Scotland.
Gavin Douglas impressed Ezra Pound who wrote: ''The texture of Gavin's
verse is stronger, the resilience greater than Chaucer's.'' James
Thomson became a literary man for all seasons in England. James
Macpherson entertained Europe with his Ossianic improvisations.
Burns became a world figure, ditto Byron and Scott. John Davidson
impressed Pound's pal T S Eliot who wrote: ''In everything that Davidson
wrote I recognise a real man, to be treated not only with respect but
with homage.'' MacDiarmid was admired by such major poets as Yeats and
Robert Lowell.
We can all be proud of particular Scottish poets but what are we to
make of Scottish poetry in general? What has the verbally ostentatious
Dunbar in common with the stylistically subdued Douglas Dunn? What has
the great sixteenth-century Alexander Scott in common with the late
Alexander Scott to whom this book is dedicated? All Scots come from one
country, all are Jock Tamson's bairns, so critics look for a cultural
continuity that unites all Scottish poets in a common cause.
The late Alex Scott, a combative scholar and good companion, was
always on about ''the cause'', by which he meant standing up for Jock
Tamson's bairns uplifted by poetic abilities. Scott conceived this
anthology but, tragically, died in 1989 when the project was still at
the planning stage. Roderick Watson completed the work ''in memory of a
man whom I was proud to know as a friend''. All for the good old cause.
In his brief introduction to his big anthology, Watson argues that
what distinguishes Scottish poetry is the tension between its demotic
and metaphysical strains. John Barbour, the first poet to make an
appearance in the anthology, used Scots as a language of freedom for the
common folk. Tom Leonard, the penultimate poet in the anthology, uses
Glasgow street speech to assert spiritual values: ''right inuff / ma
language is disgraceful / ma maw tellt mi / ma teacher tellt mi / thi
doactir tellt mi / thi priest tellt me . . . ach well / all livin
language is sacred.''
Leonard makes an important point about what Scotish poets have in
common -- a quest for the creative life of language. Whether they write
in Scots or English or Gaelic, Jock Tamson's bairns attempt to put new
life in old languages of their choice or chance. Burns renewed his
native language -- his ''Lallan tongue'' -- in the Kilmarnock Edition.
Stevenson, in an effort to emulate Burns, appealed to posterity to
accept Scots: ''I wrote in Lallan, / Dear to my heart as the peat-reek,
/ Auld as Tantallon.''
MacDiarmid, always after ''a language that can serve our purposes'',
revived Scots to hammer the English and his enemy Edwin Muir advanced
the English to hammer the Scots of MacDiarmid. Scottish poets have often
been uneasy with English. Greenock-born W S Graham, more of a Muir than
a MacDiarmid, wrote as an Anglo but asked: ''What is the language using
us for?'' MacDiarmid's metaphysical mate MacCaig curses English
conceits: ''you must learn there are words / with no meaning, words like
consolation, / words like goodbye.'' Scottish poets of all linguistic
denominations look for the language that means most to Scotland.
Some say that language is Gaelic. MacDiarmid often said so, lamenting
that he did not have enough Gaelic to compose his poems in that
language. He created versions of Gaelic verse -- by Alexander MacDonald
and Duncan Ban MacIntyre -- with more than a little help from his friend
Sorley MacLean. MacDiarmid wrote to MacLean in 1977: ''There is, I
think, no doubt about you and I being the two best poets in Scotland
today.'' There, MacDiarmid was being unusually modest. MacDiarmid and
MacLean can stand comparison with major Scottish poets of any period.
One of the most moving poems in this anthology is MacLean's ''The
National Museum of Ireland'' -- a tribute to James Connolly, ''the hero
/ who is dearest to me of them all''. Even in English translation
MacLean's emotional power shines through as he writes of a man who moved
from Scottish poverty to Irish patriotism: ''The great hero is still /
sitting on the chair / fighting the battle in the Post Office / and
cleaning streets in Edinburgh.''
Connolly, of course, was executed for his part in the Easter Rising of
1916: wounded outside the Post Office, then, too crippled to stand,
stretchered to the yard of a Dublin jail where he was strapped to a
chair and shot. Annotating MacLean's poem, Watson claims Connolly was
''born in Ulster'' which is news to those of us who believe Connolly was
born in Edinburgh. However, nobody gets it right all of the time.
Watson gets it right most of the time. He is right to give so much
space to Gaelic poetry, right to feature forgotten Scots poets like Hugh
Barclay (''God if ye knew the stait that I am in'') and Lewis Spence
(''Luve has maist years that has a murning face''), right to include
such familiar old songs as ''The Road to Dundee''.
Watson, however, fails to pay attention to poets who should be
admitted to any Scottish anthology: William Falconer, author of The
Shipwreck which Burns described as ''that glorious poem''; Janet Little,
a domestic servant who asserted herself in Burnsian style; John Barlas,
a revolutionary poet whose work enchanted Oscar Wilde.
Watson implies there is a paucity of Scottish poetry after the birth
of Douglas Dunn in 1942; yet Dunn himself proves otherwise, in his Faber
Book of Twentieth-Century Scottish Poetry. The cause continues.
Still, I strongly recommend this book to everyone interested in
Scottish poetry. It may cause quarrels among those who follow the cause
-- but that's what Scotlit is all about.

TARMAC has now agreed a price for the sale of its brick business to
Ibstock, the facing brick specialist.The #65m cash deal will make
Ibstock number two in the industry behind Hanson which takes in London
Brick and Butterley. The two groups have been in talks for some weeks
and the price represents a discount to the #88m asset value.
Tarmac uses about half the division's 300 million bricks a year output
in its housing activities and the group only increased the size of its
brick side in 1993 when it swapped its clay roof tiles operation for
Marley's brick business.
However, it is not a core activity and Tarmac thinks it can get a
better return elsewhere. Last year the division made just #1.2m on sales
of #42m.
''The UK brick industry is continuing to face a period of
rationalisation and consolidation,'' noted Tarmac chief operating
officer John Lovering.
''We have worked to add value to our business over the last two years
and believe that the agreement represents a satisfactory outcome for
Tarmac shareholders.''
Tarmac is keen to expand in Europe, where it already has a budding
empire employing 1800, in order to reduce dependence on depressed UK
construction markets. It is also aiming to expand in the eastern states
of the US where it is well established already, and in the Far East.
Ibstock will partly finance the purchase through a share placing to
raise #20m.

FRED Goodwin, who assumed the role of deputy chief executive of
Clydesdale Bank a few weeks ago, is set to succeed Frank Cicutto in the
top job around the end of next year.
Mr Goodwin, who has an accountancy background, is widely tipped to
become chief executive of the bank at the age of 38 if, as expected, Mr
Cicutto moves back to Clydesdale's National Australia Bank parent.
Mr Cicutto was speedily recruited from Australia to run Clydesdale in
January last year, following the sudden death of his predecessor,
Charles Love. At the time, Mr Cicutto, 44, was only expected to stay in
Scotland for about three years.
After 27 years with National Australia Bank, Mr Cicutto is widely
expected to take a further step up the ladder back home after his stint
in Scotland.
Mr Goodwin would be a remarkably young chief executive in the banking
sector but he appears to have the necessary credentials. The deputy
chief executive post was created specially for him.
Immediately prior to his move from accountancy firm Touche Ross to
Clydesdale Bank, Mr Goodwin was chief operating officer of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International liquidation.
He became a partner of Touche Ross at the age of 29. A year later, in
1989, he was appointed by the Government as an executive director of
Belfast-based aerospace and defence company Short Brothers in the run-up
to its privatisation.
As a result of the creation of the deputy chief executive job, the
general manager of banking post, held by Douglas Corner for several
years, is being scrapped.
Mr Corner, who feels he should not stand in the way of progress, will
leave the bank in the next few weeks after more than 25 years' service.
The new management structure, which became effective two weeks ago,
has produced a string of key appointments.
Ian MacDonald, who formerly supervised banking operations, became head
of retail services. He is responsible for branch support functions,
insurance, personal banking and financial services.
Bob Brice, previously in charge of business markets, assumes wider

<HEADLINE>English banks to reduce collective holdings in 3i</HEADLINE>

THE Bank of England and three English clearing banks say they intend
selling a total of about 20% of the 3i venture capital group which will
raise about #400m.
At present, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has 6.6%, Lloyds 9%,
Barclays 8.2% and Midland 7.9%, together totalling about 31.7% out of
the overall 51.9% held by UK banks.
It is planned to reduce this to around 12% after 3i announces its
preliminary results on June 8.
The Royal Bank of Scotland sold out completely its 7.3% investment at
the time of flotaion last July when 262 million shares or 44.9% of the
equity was offered at 272p, worth #710m, with 65.4 million shares being
allocated to the public. That was just oversubscribed as it coincided
with a large number of other flotations against the background of a
turbulent equity market.
3i shares went into retreat, dropping 9p to 346p.
The Bank of Scotland with 2.5% and National Westminster with 17.8%
have said that they are retaining their holdings. On the Mound, the view
is that the bank is still very satisfied with its stake which has
appreciated by 27% in value since the flotation.
It is believed that the Bank of England will sell out completely
because in addition to banks not being natural holders of equity, it
faces a conflict of interest between being a regulator and an investor.
At the time of flotation, banks overall controlled 96.8% of the stock.
When the shares were sold, one condition was that there was a moratorium
on further disposals until after the preliminary figures next month.
The announcement has been made partly to head-off speculation that
shares could be dribbled out afterwards and also to allow joint brokers
de Zoete &amp; Bevan, James Capel and NatWest Securities to build an orderly
institutional book ahead of the sale.
The public will be able to apply for stock through financial
intermediaries.
3i was enthusiastically underlining its investment performance
yesterday. It pointed out that over the 10 years to March 1994, the
compound annual return including reinvesting dividends was 16.1%. That
compares with the Smaller Company Investment Trusts' 11.9% and the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index 15.4% although both of these are ahead of
the Venture Capital Investment Trusts' 10%.
Net asset value is currently estimated by analysts at between 350p and
360p.

BUSINESS is seen as being all about greed and short-termism, the
Princess Royal said yesterday.
She told delegates at the British Chambers of Commerce annual
conference in Aberdeen that it was not always easy for commerce and
industry to attract the right people.
''It's not easy because the image of business is all about quick
profit, what you can get out of it, short-termism, a perceived level of
greed,'' she said.
''That may not be accurate, but it is a definite danger with images
that business needs to attract the right people.''
Robin Geldard, president of the BCC, commented that the Princess's
comments about greed might have referred to the row over excessive
boardroom pay.
She said Chambers of Commerce had an important role to play in selling
the right image, one of long-term investment and looking after customers
and employees.
Short-termism was one of the greatest dangers for all enterprises, she
added. ''There's nothing wrong with taking a profit. It's necessary. You
can argue about the scale of it and how it is used,'' she said.
The Princess said the conference had given delegates the opportunity
to discuss their own betes noir, one of which she expected everyone
would like to have a go at -- the Treasury.
But she added: ''I'm not allowed to do this so I shall pass on.''

THE Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday announced the sale of Chelsea's
Stamford Bridge stadium, one of the bank's highest-profile assets, to a
director of the football club for #16.5m.
Three years ago, Royal Bank acquired the company which owns the
freehold of the ground. The purchase was part of a rescue deal which
allowed Chelsea to remain at Stamford Bridge following the collapse of
the stadium's previous owners.
The ground's new owner is Matthew Harding, a lifelong fan of the west
London club and chairman of The Benfield Group reinsurance company.
Mr Harding has already committed #5m to the construction of a north
stand, which has transformed Stamford Bridge. He has also provided #2.5m
to fund player purchases.
The 1992 rescue deal, which ended years of uncertainty and legal
battles, gave Chelsea a new 20-year lease and the right to buy the
stadium within this period. The club retains the right to purchase
Stamford Bridge from Mr Harding.
Royal Bank said its discussions with the director had been based on
safeguarding the future of Chelsea and its ground.
Dr George Mathewson, chief executive of the Edinburgh-based bank,
said: ''We are particularly proud of the role we at the bank have played
in enabling Chelsea to consolidate their position and go on playing at
Stamford Bridge into the future.''

LADY CLAIRE'S KITCHEN
For the coming summer months the price of asparagus
will come down from its winter heights. But for
Lady Claire Macdonald it is still one of life's luxuries
ASPARAGUS used to be available for a very brief time, and it used to
be a real luxury food item. We could only buy it for about three weeks
during its all-too-short season, and great was my envy of all clever
enough to grow it beyond the few straggly stalks which were all that we
managed to produce -- Godfrey and I are not renowned for our ability as
gardeners!
But you will notice my use of the past tense, because these are
changed days for all who love to eat asparagus. Over the past few years
we've been able to buy asparagus pretty well all year round. I don't
really approve of this, but I do love being able to have access to
asparagus over a period of two or three months rather than the inside of
a month, as it used to be.
Asparagus is like strawberries, from my point of view. I just can't
bring myself to buy them in the winter months when they are so far
removed from their natural season to this country.
You will see neatly packaged asparagus for sale on the shelves of all
good supermarkets. Depending on the time of year, it will vary from
being very expensive to being far less costly in the next couple of
months. You will pay far more dearly for the packages containing just
the asparagus tips, but these can be useful for a salad, or as a garnish
for a chopped egg mousse.
As with all things vegetable (and, regrettably, for most meat and
game) there is a current vogue for undercooking asparagus. Whereas
overcooked asparagus, like most green vegetables, is really unpleasant,
for my taste the flavour of undercooked asparagus is pretty nasty, too.
It needs to be cooked till you can stick the prongs of a fork into the
thickest stem with ease. Much of the asparagus for sale is very
thin-stemmed, and takes a very short time to cook to this tender stage.
I prefer steaming asparagus to any other form of cooking. There are
thin, tall asparagus-cooking saucepans on the market, to enable us to
cook a tied bunch of asparagus standing up, with the tips uppermost --
they need the least cooking -- but I find my steamer cooks asparagus
perfectly.
If I intend to serve it cold, I run cold water through it for a few
seconds, once it's cooked, to refresh its colour.
Asparagus can form the main part of a salad, which, served with good
bread and a lemon (or lime) mayonnaise, is delicious.
Asparagus soup is one of the best, provided (as ever) that you have
good stock -- I use chicken stock, but for non-meat eaters a good
vegetable stock -- for the liquid content.
For soup, I chop off the asparagus tips and steam them, slicing them,
once steamed, into small bits. I chop the rest of the stalks and cook
them, with chopped onion, in a butter and sunflower oil combination for
several minutes, before adding the stock.
ONCE the pieces of stalk are tender, I liquidise the soup and then
sieve it -- this is really necessary, much as I loathe washing up
sieves, because you invariably get a stringy bit of stalk and the aim is
for a velvety smooth textured soup.
If you like, you can stir single cream through the soup and the sliced
cooked asparagus tips, season the soup with a grating of nutmeg and salt
and pepper to your taste, and serve it chilled.
If you intend serving it hot, reheat it, with the sliced tips, but
swirl double cream, or put a dollop of creme fraiche on each serving,
rather than reheating it with cream in it. Season it with nutmeg, salt,
and pepper as for the chilled soup.
Asparagus combines deliciously well with fish, shellfish, and
well-sauted mushrooms. Steamed, chopped, and stirred into a creamy white
sauce (again, seasoned with nutmeg as well as salt and pepper), this is
very good with pasta, or as a filling for crepes. Just sprinkled with
grated cheese and served with warm granary bread, it makes an ideal
light lunch or supper dish.
Here is a recipe for a very easy and convenient first course. Its only
slight drawback is that I think it is necessary to sieve the pureed
asparagus before mixing it with the eggs and cream, but then that's just
me being lazy, once again, about washing up!
Anything which is turned out, as these timbales are, and served with a
sauce, tends to look rather more effortful in their making than these
are. The sauce I recommend serving is the Hollandaise, which I would eat
with anything -- I've even been known to eat it on bread, and rather
more often than once . . .
ASPARAGUS TIMBALES with HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
(serves 8)
butter, 8 large ramekins
1lb asparagus
[1/2] pint single cream
4 large eggs, beaten
salt, black pepper
freshly grated nutmeg.
* STEAM the asparagus till it is barely tender, then whiz it to a
puree in a food processor. Sieve the puree. Rinse out the processor and
put the puree back in the processor. Whiz, adding the eggs, one by one,
then the cream. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg -- two or three
gratings. Spoon this mixture into the buttered ramekins, and put them in
a roasting tin with hot water coming halfway up their sides.
Bake in a moderate oven -- 350F, gas mark 4, 180C -- for 25 minutes,
or till the mixture feels quite firm to the touch. Take them out of the
oven, and carefully lift the ramekins out of the water. Let them sit for
10 minutes before running a knife around the inside of each ramekin and
turning them out on to warmed plates. Serve with Hollandaise sauce.
HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
4 tablespoons white wine vinegar
about 6 black peppercorns
a bayleaf, a slice of raw onion
4oz butter, cut in pieces
2 large egg yolks, a pinch of salt
* PUT the wine vinegar, peppercorns, bayleaf, and slice of onion into
a small saucepan and boil fast till the liquid has reduced to about two
tablespoons. Strain this into a heatproof bowl and add a small piece of
butter. Mix well -- I use a flat wire whisk for this -- then beat in the
yolks. Put the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and beat in the
butter, a piece at a time. Season with a pinch of salt. If at any time
the sauce looks as though it is about to curdle, take the bowl off the
pan, and beat like mad with a tablespoon or two of hot water from the
pan. Serve the sauce as soon as you can once you have added all the
butter and it is thick, but it does keep warm successfully on a very low
heat.
An alternative way to make Hollandaise is to melt the butter in a pan,
whiz the yolks in a processor, and add the hot butter in a thin, steady
trickle. Whiz in the strained, reduced vinegar last.

THE electricity industry watchdog Offer has extended its deadline for
the submission of a report on pricing by Scottish Hydro-Electric until
the end of May to allow time for it to be written up.
The report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) was
originally due to have been submitted to the Office of Electricity
Regulation (Offer) by this weekend.
The MMC opened an inquiry into Scottish Hydro's distribution pricing
policy after the Perth-based power company rejected the recommendations
of a price review by the industry regulator last summer.
Scottish Hydro argued that the price structure proposed would give it
a rate of return of less than 2%, compared to about 7% for
ScottishPower, taking into account the need for extensive refurbishment
of ageing power lines in the north of Scotland.
''We are typically spending #40m a year on refurbishment, but we need
to spend about double that,'' said Scottish Hydro spokesman Mike
Keohane.
An Offer spokesman said the MMC report would not be published until
mid-June at the earliest.

* MEANWHILE, still in Aberdeen, shareholders of GRT Bus Group
yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of the company's proposed
merger with Badgerline Group to form FirstBus.
Overall, the plan received 96% approval, with about three-in-four
employee votes cast in favour.
Speaking after the shareholders' meeting, GRT chairman Moir Lockhead
said: ''Today we received the approval of major institutional
shareholders and private individuals alike.
''The positive feedback received from our employees over the last few
weeks is clearly reflected in the figures.''
The #265m merger will create the second-largest UK bus company to
Perth-based giant Stagecoach, with FirstBus running a 5600-strong fleet.
Shareholders of Badgerline, whose stronghold is southern England,
backed the deal at a meeting in Bath on Thursday.
Assuming the scheme is approved by the Scottish and English courts,
dealings in FirstBus shares will commence on June 16.
GRT shareholders, who will own 36.4% of the merged group, will receive
about 1.9 FirstBus shares for every one currently held. Badgerline
investors, who will own the remaining 63.6%, will be allocated shares in
the new company on a one-for-one basis.
Shares in GRT were unchanged at 271p.

<HEADLINE>Murdoch bids to relieve Berlusconi of his TV Offer pitched at $2800m</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978419876</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MEDIA tycoon Rupert Murdoch is reported to have offered to buy former
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's television stations for
$2800m.
The Milan-based financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore said in a report
datelined New York, that the proposed deal with Murdoch's News
Corporation would also include the television advertising agency
operated by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest.
Fininvest confirmed it was ''evaluating'' an offer for its three
national television stations from News Corporation. Mr Murdoch's
Milan-based attorneys confirmed the reported price is ''substantially
correct'', Italian media reported.
Il Sole said Fininvest, which is 100% owned by Berlusconi, was
expected to reply by the weekend.
Mr Berlusconi, who was Italy's Prime Minister for seven months until
losing power last December, has repeatedly said he would be willing to
sell his television stations at the right price to end controversy over
the conflict of interest with his political activities.
The media magnate is leader of the centre-right Freedom Alliance which
hopes to return to power when elections are held, possibly in October.
According to Il Sole, which gave no source for its report, Mr Murdoch
was offering to buy 51% outright at an agreed price, with the value of
the remaining stake to be set after a June 11 referendum on television
ownership.
In the referendum, backed by Mr Berlusconi's political opponents,
Italians will be asked to limit the number of national television
stations owned by one private-sector company or individual to one.
When Berlusconi entered politics last year, he promised to sever ties
with the media and retail holdings but never followed through. His
eight-month-old conservative government collapsed in December.
Fininvest has three channels which share almost equally the national
viewing audience with the three stations of state broadcaster RAI.
There has been reports in recent weeks -- unconfirmed by Fininvest --
that the company was in negotiations with Time-Warne, Germany's Kirch
Gruppe, a Saudi prince and a group of institutional investors.

RIVER PHOENIX: THE BIOGRAPHY
John Glatt
Piatkus Books, #9.99 (pbk)
RIVER Phoenix was the wistful child star who made his name in such
films as Stand By Me and The Mosquito Coast. He grew into an intense
young man, whose portrayal of rent-boy Mike Scott in My Own Private
Idaho (1991) showed promise of a very great actor. River Phoenix was a
passionate, vegan, save-the-planet freak who preached ''clean, pure
living''; he refused to wear a scrap of leather, and scolded friends for
drinking Pepsi.
''Just say no,'' advised Phoenix in Nancy Reagan's anti-drug drive.
One October 31, 1993, the star collapsed and died outside the Viper Room
nightclub in Los Angeles. The autopsy found him pumped with heroin,
cocaine, marijuana, Valium, and a soporific cold medication. He was only
23 years old.
A James Dean of our time? Perhaps, if you like the iconic photographs
in this book and weep over Phoenix's wasted life. It's a well-written
tale which tells it, more or less, like it was -- the appalling hippie
parents, the sex abuse little River endured in the evil cult to which
they belonged, and at length how they used him not only to peddle their
addled philosophy but to bankroll them, the entire Phoenix clan, and a
swelling host of disreputable hangers-on.
At times Glatt, a youthful fame-and-tears muckraker, is too prone to
the Kitty Kelly tactic of hints rather than specifics. He implies, for
example, that My Own Private Idaho not only tempted Phoenix to serious
drug use but to experiments in gay sex. In fact, though politically
correct to the point of ennui, Phoenix's physicality was perfectly
wholesome.
Glatt argues -- a view shared by Phoenix's father -- that the
Hollywood system destroyed a young star. And if at times you cringe at
precious River in conversation, or deplore the PR hypocrisy of his last
years on earth, you cannot but be moved by the saga of his final misery,
or the many little acts of practical kindness he did for those he loved.
It wasn't the system that killed him; it was his oh-so-right-on
parents, who stole his childhood and refused to lift their claws from
his life. Phoenix pere has been reduced to alcoholism. One must likewise
hope that Providence silences River's ghastly mother.

GO into a supermarket or one of the major multiple specialists such as
Victoria Wine or Threshers and you are confronted by a bewildering range
of beer brands.
Last year about 80 new products were launched into the market to cater
for the take-home trade which saw volumes rise by 6%, worth #2029m.
However, many of the introductions brought nothing new, compounded by
their being offered in four-packs and 12-packs to confuse the customer
further.
The Whitbread Beer Company in its Take-Home Beer Market Report 1994
argues that there is a real need for the trade to devote less space to
''me-too'' brands and instead create more room for those that offer the
consumer something really different.
Although many brewers are fighting rearguard actions by offering
bigger discounts to the retailers to maintain their products on the
shelves, it is evident that this will inevitably fail in time as the
multiples concentrate their selling on the fast-growing brands.
Significantly, there are now over 40 in-can system or widget bitter
beers available. But most of the new arrivals are simply creating
confusion as they offer nothing much in particular. So they are being
sold at below premium prices and damaging customer perception of the
widget beers deserving a price premium.
The Scottish beer market is the fastest growing, rising by 10% in both
volume and value in 1994 to 952,000 barrels or about 275 million pints
worth #258m.
It is dominated by Tennent's standard lager with a 16% market share,
four times higher than McEwan's although the number two is growing about
six times faster than Tennent's improvement in 1994.
Altogether, standard, commodity, premium and superstrength lager
accounts for 69% of Scottish beer consumption by volume and value
compared with 65% in England and Wales.
Gold brands, such as Tennent's Gold and S&amp;N's Coors Extra Gold, are
losing popularity in premium lagers to the heavily promoted Beck's and
Budweiser.
Bitter, which until recently was firmly rejected by the Scottish
drinker to drink at home, perhaps because of its quality, now has a 5%
share with Boddington's Draught widget beer up 17%. The market has been
led by the Belhaven Best in the on-trade in 1991 which created a bright
beer and is less gassy with a rich creamy head.
These introductions, including the S&amp;N Classic Ales -- McEwans 80/-
and 90/- and Younger's No 3 -- have brought more interest to the bottled
sector.
S&amp;N seems to be losing out with its 2% rise in value to #196m last
year for a 10% share puts it in just fifth place among the six major
brewers. In contrast, Whitbread is seeing growth of 9% and Courage by
17% -- although the mooted acquisition of Courage from Foster's may help
resolve that problem.
The overall trend is for the consumer to move away from the standard
product towards premium beers in the take-home sector which accounts for
26% of sales at present and is forecast to rise to 34% by 2000. That
contrasts with 75% in America, 71% in Australia, arguably the most
apposite comparison, and well over 60% in France, Holland and Germany.
But the fastest-growing drink is cider which saw a 13% volume advance
last year and by 9% in value.
Scotland leads the field by a conspicuous margin. According to
Britain's biggest cider-maker, HP Bulmer, there was a 21% leap in the
cider take-home trade last year.
The overall market is over 6.5 million gallons and Scottish pubs have
the highest penetration of premium-packaged ciders while the country
overall accounts for 14% of the premium end of the market.

NOT having been to one in years, I was under the impression that zoos
were to family entertainment what the shell suit is to power dressing.
If that's true, then nobody had told the vast crowds queueing to get in
to Edinburgh Zoo last Mayday holiday. Believing the myth, we turned up
at midday expecting to stroll right in and begin our tour of the zoo.
Instead we found queues snaking (to coin a phrase) right round the
block. After half an hour we finally entered.
At Edinburgh, the first exhibit you see is a huge plastic elephant
with a sign explaining why they don't have any live elephants on show.
Not because they're too mean, you understand, just that to live in
comfort, elephants need to live in a huge expanse of space with a large
group of other elephants. Even large empty areas such as the terracing
at Firhill would only allow the equivalent of battery elephant farming,
so zoos are not the best places to keep them. I went on feeling that the
zoo at least had the animals' interests at heart. This happy start set
the tone for the afternoon.
The zoos I remember from childhood were, in contrast, very sad places.
Seeing depressed, bored, and agitated animals when you are an adolescent
is too much like looking into a mirror. Like many teenagers, I was often
unhappy without really knowing why, but at least I wasn't as badly
affected by adolescent angst as some.
You only have to hear Morrissey to know how maudlin teenagers become.
The most intractably sad morose weirdos become Joy Division fans,
usually developing an obsession with suicide. The problem with these
poseurs is that they can't distinguish sensitivity from self-indulgence.
Thankfully this dire moroseness is a temporary condition which, unlike
the desire to own a Scalectrix, fades with time.
As far as our kids were concerned, the main aim of the journey was to
see, and if possible chat to, every creature that featured in The Lion
King. For your ''run of the mill'' zoo animals that's fine, but have you
ever tried to explain to a four-year-old that (a) you don't know if
there is a meerkat in Edinburgh Zoo, and (b) what the hell is a meerkat
anyway, son, get a life? The problem with letting young kids watch
Disney films is that they perpetuate a myth that all animals, even in
the wild, possess an inate talent for singing and dancing. This is not
the worst untruth they've peddled, as someone must have told Dick Van
Dyke that his cockney accent in Mary Poppins was quite accurate.
The animals liked the hot weather almost as much as the zoo visitors
did. The lions were sunning themselves, as complacent as only a couple
with a meal ticket for life can be. The Government's policy of care in
the community has assured them of more fresh meat than ever, which
explains why they're so smug. The rest of the big cats' enclosure
reinforced my doubts about evolution. Most big cats seem to have a
penchant for being invisible in any semi-natural environment, a talent
they were desperate to display last Monday. I actually enjoyed watching
large crowds of people arriving eagerly, staring at the cage, then
leaving after a few minutes with the kind of puzzled and disappointed
expression that I use when hearing that my lottery numbers have not come
up.
In the wild, camouflage is undoubtedly a good thing. It's not the most
desirable attribute if you want to spend the rest of your life as a zoo
exhibit. If the whole point of being there is to be seen by an endless
stream of toddlers, then the last thing you want to be is invisible. If
you want to be in a zoo, the least that evolution could do is provide
you with a talent for doing something interesting; perhaps an ability to
work puppets, or sing large sections of the Disney back catalogue.
We all want to see giraffes with their long neck, rhinos with their
huge horn, zebras with their stripes, and what have leopards got? They
can hide. Brilliant. In these economically-inclined times, these cats
have got to get their act together and realise that no-one's going to
pay a fortune to feed you if you can't even entertain the visitors.
What's the point in helping these creatures to breed if no-one can see
the results?
That's where elephants have got it wrong, you see. If it could just
wise up, settle down, put up with a bit less legroom and a few less
chums, it could have had a meal ticket for life. No more dodging the
ivory hunters, just plenty of time to have a stroll (not too far,
admittedly) and eat buns.
Anyone who ever doubted the fascination kids hold for animals should
see the penguin parade. Penguins are Edinburgh's big attraction, and
they've got this huge complex (in the physical, rather than the
''everybody really hates me'' sense). At two o'clock we were waiting
anxiously, along with the entire paying public, around the penguin
complex for the Penguin Parade. It was a sweltering afternoon and most
of the kids were getting a big crabby. The sound of children squawking
surrounded us, and was matched only by the sound of adults bickering. I
did find myself wondering why I was waiting for this, I mean the penguin
parade would just be lots of penguins, sort of, well . . . parading. I'd
seen a penguin waddle before, so what was the big deal? I soon saw.
As the penguins emerged for their daily stroll, a wave of silence
swept through the crowd faster than a rumour round a football terracing.
Toddlers were quiet for the first time since lunch. Adults eagerly leant
over to see the penguins waddle past, everyone watching the small birds
saunter past. Penguins must have a very high street value because they
had several minders, whose job it was to part the crowd and prevent any
penguin nappers from going about their business. It was like Madonna on
tour, except with better tunes. After they had gone, all that was left
was the sound of excited chatter. No whining, no grumping, just
excitement. Magic. The kids enjoyed it too.
Zoos are important places. They allow you to see exotic animals
without the cost involved in travelling to Africa, buying 20 rolls of
film with which to bore all your friends, and treating a chronic bowel
infection. They help keep rare animals alive, sometimes breeding them to
help prevent extinction, and they'll happily sell you an ice cream when
it's hot.
Most importantly they give children an appreciation of animals that
you just can't get from even the best Attenborough videos. Mainly that
they smell so badly. Say what you like about animals, some may be
smarter than others, but none of them has learned how to wash under its
arms or have a regular bath. It even put our lot off the idea of keeping
a meerkat at home.

A Motherwell success story, Ian Skelly, is back home and in business.
Jack Webster meets the car salesman supreme
AS Ian Skelly casts an eye over the landscape of his childhood, he
expresses himself well satisfied to be back on the home ground of
Motherwell. It is a mixture of business instinct and family sentiment
that has focused his attention once more on the Steel Town of Scotland,
which threatened to become a ghost town as that industry went into
terminal decline.
Now the sight of a distinguished native, king of the car trade, as he
returns with meaningful millions -- and a burning optimism in the future
of his native heath -- must surely rank as the finest of omens for that
corner of Scotland.
In practical terms, what has happened is that Ian Skelly, who went to
the top as a giant of the European motor trade before selling out, has
come back to start a modestly-sized dealership in the town where his
late father opened a little back-street garage in 1924.
William G Skelly built a substantial local business before being
joined by his three ambitious sons in the 1950s. The story of son Ian
since then must rank as a major business romance, turning him into a
multi-millionaire with a mansion at Carluke and a town house in London.
In personal terms, however, all the comfort of the Concorde life has
changed him not a whit. At 61, he talks the same language, keeps the
same standards, and sees the same friends of 30 years ago.
''I was very close to my father and remember such happy times with him
here in Motherwell,'' says Ian Skelly, as he forks out #3 million on a
prestigious new car complex at Shields Road.
By the terms of selling the Audi/Volkswagen agency of the Ian Skelly
Centre of Glasgow in 1989, he is prevented from using the name with
which he was christened. The happy solution, however, has been to
reintroduce the name with which his father established himself --
Skelly's of Motherwell.
This time he has gone with Nissan, who are manufacturing their cars
within the convenient distance of Washington, Tyneside.
One of the reasons he sold the Ian Skelly Centre -- it was bought by
Appleyard for #18.3 million -- was the absence of a successor. His only
daughter, Sara, is a fine-art designer in Paris but, even if not
planning to run a car business, she has come back to lend her artistic
hand to the planning of the new building in Motherwell. Her father is
delighted.
Now, as he takes on his first 50 employees, he reflects on the chance
to do something for his own area and to build a substantial local
business, in the manner of his father, without any ambition to spread
into a massive group, as happened the first time round.
''Lanarkshire was too dependent on heavy industry,'' he observes.
''But I believe it will come back strongly in the next 10 years. There
are signs that things are picking up, and now there is a chance to do
something else. I feel it is up to people like me to set an example.''
People like Ian Skelly, with a sure business sense and a track record
to prove it, are invaluable assets to any community which attracts their
devotion.
''With the closure of Ravenscraig, companies like Clyde Alloy went
with them and that was the site I bought. The land was just lying there
derelict, so I took over a chunk of it and have turned it into the scene
of my new business.''
Thus life comes full circle for the man who became one of the most
significant figures in the motor trade of the United Kingdom.
From that family start in Motherwell, sons Billy, Ian and Sherwood
harnessed their father's success and produced a second-generation
dimension by expanding it to Glasgow, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock and
Liverpool, establishing themselves as main Ford dealers by the 1960s. It
was a dynamic family team, in which Ian was the marketing front-man --
the best-known face. But an apparently rock-solid unity burst apart with
a family rift in 1974.
The outcome was that Ian Skelly went his own way, gaining an
Audi-Volkswagen agency and starting in a very modest manner at
Dalmarnock Road, Glasgow, in 1976. Customers followed his personal
magnetism and within four years the embryo business had become the
biggest Audi/VW agency in the United Kingdom.
It spread to Wishaw, Liverpool and Manchester, and became the biggest
in Europe, outside Germany itself.
Steeped in the motor trade for 38 years, often for seven days a week
-- but without a successor -- Ian Skelly felt the business had gone
beyond the personal touch, which had been the secret of his success. ''I
had two possible routes -- I could go public or just sell out,'' he
explained. He chose the latter and decided it was also time to relax and
see a bit of the world.
With #18m's worth of consolation, he didn't sever the business links
altogether. A couple of million went into the Colindale Centre, another
automotive venture in north London, but he has since sold that business,
while retaining the property as part of a #5 million retail portfolio in
that part of the metropolis.
A fashionable house in Lowndes Square became part of the broader
lifestyle as Skelly and his wife Rita toured the world, spending four
consecutive winters in Australia.
''But after four or five years of travelling I've seen everything I
want to see and, although I'm very fond of Australia, I still prefer
Scotland to anywhere,'' he says. ''I've also discovered I'm not a
retirement animal. This is the business I love, and I cannot get away
from it.''
His time out of business also marked some health problems, with a
couple of major operations. But all in all, he knew that he thrived on
activity.
In 1992 he finally accepted the pressing invitation of David Murray to
join the board of Rangers Football Club, where his business acumen has
been playing a significant part in the commercial success at Ibrox. But
Ian Skelly has always managed to maintain good relations across the
sporting divide, including a friendship with the late Jock Stein, whose
Manager of the Year award for the Lisbon Lions' season of 1967 is among
his prized possessions.
Through all the success, the main home has never been anywhere but the
mansion at Carluke, complete with swimming pool and floodlit tennis
courts. It is within easy reach of Motherwell, upon which the Skelly
skills will now be concentrated. After the furnaces of steel dimmed, the
fates have turned up for that brave Lanarkshire town -- a spark of hope
which will surely herald a brighter way ahead.

WHAT happens if you go on a Club 18-25 holiday and don't get laid? Do
you sue under the Trade Descriptions Act? Or does the company rely on
humiliation subverting any notion of complaint?
I ask only because the Advertising Standards Authority this week came
over all tough to warn that misleading commercials which lead overweight
people to believe they can shed fat by, say, slurping slime green
Chinese tea or slathering gunge on the thighs before tucking into a
deep-fried steak pie supper could be banned.
It might be a breakthrough. For surely the diet industry has the
perfect product. It doesn't work, but the consumers blame themselves not
the product. Like those who creep home from Ibiza with their condoms
intact.
There is a precedent for complaints about diet products that don't
work. Dr Jane Dunkeld, in her commonsensible overview of diets, *The
Good Diet Guide, notes that complaints to the ASA about a pair of German
shoe insoles advertised as part of a weight-loss programme were upheld.
Whether people found them indigestible or merely useless in honing
hamster-cheeks is not explained.
The trouble is that while we may attack the diet industry, accuse it
of promoting an unnatural ideal, yak on about the obsession with images
of women as stick insects that oppress people's lives, we still nip out
at lunchtime for the product that promises to shed our weight for us
while we indulge our overwhelming need for five Cadbury's chocolate
rolls.
Dr Dunkeld, an Edinburgh-based psychologist, holds to the view that if
we're going to fool ourselves we might as well do it from the basis of
some knowledge.
Of course we know that we might as well call out a witch doctor as
consult a diet guru. Yes, yes, we're well aware that there's no sound
way of losing weight other than by consuming less food or taking more
exercise. It doesn't matter. One visit to a communal changing room,
where a skelf with big hair prinks in front of the mirror asking her
obligatory obese friend whether the wisp of a frock makes her look fat,
and we're back in Boots scouring the shelves for a miracle before you
can say mini Mars bar please.
Anyway, whoever came up with the idea that commercials have to be
honest and truthful? It's absurd. It's oxymoronic. Or maybe just
moronic. I mean do you know anyone who admits to talcuming their
carpets? Somebody must. Sales of a product promoted by a delirious woman
frenziedly Hoovering with one hand while deoderising a rug with the
other created a whole new market in guilt-ridden consumers
surrepticiously sniffing their Axminsters. Contemplate life inside the
mind that dreamt it up.
Sex and guilt sell. Who would argue? Certainly not the persuaders who
can come up with images to convince us to swap soap powder and thus
prevent bobbling. What the hell is bobbling? If you wash your clothes a
lot they look older. Now you can use Ariel to keep them looking new
longer. Cheaper and quicker all round, don't you agree, is not to wash
them at all.
I've yet to hear complaints about the current spate of commercials for
motors. For cars, you would think to watch television at the moment, are
bought solely to open women's legs. There's the smug wimp who takes his
boss's girlfriend home via the beach. It's evidently the Citroen she
fancies because she'll flirt with whoever's driving it. Even a man in a
bri-nylon shirt. Very likely.
There's Papa and Nicole still getting up to hanky-panky if they so
much as glimpse their Clio. And the latest Peugeot ad takes the entire
contents of the biscuit barrel. No innuendo on this one. Marvin Gaye's
erotic anthem Sexual Healing used to sell a tinny wee number that would
barely arouse more than a titter in a motorway encounter.
The images seem incredibly crass. All you do is buy this car and wait
for leggy models to appear in your local multi-storey. Alternatively,
women need merely pull into the car park for a Liam Neeson-lookalike to
shimmy up the concrete rampart, when we know it's going to be an anorak
with a halitosis habit skulking around trying to look up skirts.
This not only seems rather witless now that women also buy cars, but
confused. Maybe it shows a touching concern with moral standards, the
advertising adaptation of the old rule of always keeping one leg on the
floor, but the bit on the side always turns out to have been the wife or
fiancee all the time.
The twist is that the Demi Moore fantasy turns out to be the wife,
although she never looks like any mother of two small children I've ever
met.
Robinson, #6.99.

Introducing a new series in conjunction with the National Galleries of
Scotland, Dr Duncan Thomson assesses the work of Sir Henry Raeburn.
FEW painters have fixed so clearly in our minds the people of a past
society as Sir Henry Raeburn. It is in the direct, honest, and
sympathetic portraits that were his life's work that we see those who
graced the social and intellectual life of Scotland in the later years
of the enlightenment.
He was born in 1756 in the village of Stockbridge, just beyond the
fields where the New Town of Edinburgh would rise in the next few
decades. An orphan by 1763, his brother William, who had seen to his
upbringing, apprenticed him to a jeweller called James Gilliland. It was
probably in that trade that he developed his wonderful skills for fine
detail that so often complement the broadly-brushed canvases of his
maturity.
The steps that led to a career in painting are not clear. He must have
worked with miniatures in the jeweller's shop and his earliest known
work is a miniature of the engraver David Deuchar. Deuchar may well have
encouraged him and he may have had help from the painter David Martin
who had once worked for Allan Ramsay, but he seems to have been largely
self-taught.
In the spring of 1784 he set off on a journey to Rome where he stayed
until 1786. By this time he was married to a wealthy widow, Anne Edgar,
while in Rome he painted what may well be his earliest full-scale
portrait, of a young man called Patrick Moir. It is accomplished, but
its smooth forms are quite unlike his later work which would have a
painterly freedom that led to accusations of a lack of ''finish'' from
his more conservative clients.
Back in Edinburgh, he quickly set up a highly successful practice and
before long had the field to himself. The influence of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, whom he may have met in London, soon vanished and he developed
his own distinctive style based on direct observation, with little
pre-planning and no underdrawing.
In the 1790s he became particularly interested in effects of strong
light behind silhouetted shapes. These paintings included the
wonderfully sensitive double portrait of Sir John and Lady Clerk in
front of a Midlothian landscape. About the same time he painted what is
now his best-known picture, the Revd Robert Walker Skating on
Duddingston Loch -- indeed it has become one of the most famous
paintings in the world, although it was virtually unknown before 1949
when it was bought by the National Gallery of Scotland.
In the early years of the nineteenth century he painted the great
series of full-length portraits which are almost equally famous -- such
as those of Sir John Sinclair of Ulster and Colonel Alastair MacDonell
of Glengarry, both in exotic Highland garb. From his rapid brush also
flowed a whole series of less spectacular but equally perceptive
portraits of establishment figures and the less well-known, such as the
judge Lord Newton and the obscure merchant James Cruickshank and his
wife Margaret Gerard (both now in the Frick Collection in New York).
In his later years he tried on occasion to ape London styles,
especially that of Sir Thomas Lawrence. This resulted in work that is a
little mannered, such as the sensual protrait of Mrs Scott Moncrieff,
but his best work retained a rare directness and simplicity. In 1810 he
had actually contemplated moving to London, but decided against. If he
had done so, it would have been an incalculable loss to Scotland and to
its knowledge of itself.
Raeburn died in the summer of 1823, shortly after a holiday excursion
into Fife with a number of friends, including Sir Walter Scott, whose
portrait he had just completed. He had been knighted the previous year
by George IV and given the title of ''King's Limner in Scotland''.
* A series of 21 booklets issued in conjunction with this series of
articles about the Scottish Masters is available from the National
Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, and Kelvin Art Gallery, Glasgow. Each
volume, price #2.95, contains an illustrated essay on the artist and
their time, 12 full-page reproductions of their work, and a selected
bibliography.

SO who said that television drama was dying on its feet? This week the
networks confound their critics with three major new series, featuring a
host of top actors, and with production values which any self-respecting
film maker would die for.
Count them. BBC1 launches a prestigious historical serial, The Hanging
Gale, starring the entire McGann clan. ITV chips in with The Governor, a
contemporary prison drama from the pen of Lynda La Plante. And then
there is The Politician's Wife, the new three-parter from Channel 4 with
Juliet Stevenson and Trevor Eve. Worth noting, mind you, that all three
are independent productions, commissioned by the major channels.
Add to this the third and, for the moment final, Prime Suspect, and a
one-off BBC2 film, The Absence of War, with John Thaw, and you get the
distinct impression that everything in the television drama garden is
rosy, for the time being at least.
If you're still not convinced, bear in mind that two more big
mainstream dramas will wind their way to your screens over the next two
weeks -- Bramwell, Lucy (Peak Practice and Soldier Soldier) Gannon's
period medical drama for ITV and Out of The Blue, a promising six-part
cop show from BBC1. Someone is shaking the drama tree.
Sunday is definitely a night to set the video recorder as the Beeb and
ITV clash head on with two of the aforementioned serials. BBC1 might
just have the edge with The Hanging Gale (9pm), an epic saga about an
Irish family struggling to save their farm from a wicked English
landowner following the ravages of the potato famine in 1846.
Mrs McGann must be fair proud of her four boys. There's Joe (Charlie
in the ITV sitcom The Upper Hand), Paul (The Monocled Mutineer and
Withnail and I), Mark (who's had movie roles in No Surrender and Let Him
Have It), and Stephen (with extensive theatrical work to his credit and
who co-starred with Brian Cox in last year's Grushko). The Beatles, it
seems, were not the only fab four to emerge from Liverpool.
In The Hanging Gale, the McGann siblings star as the Phelan brothers,
struggling to avoid starvation and maintain their smallholding when
their greedy landlord keeps raising the rent. It's the first time the
brothers have appeared together for 12 years. Indeed, they've tried very
hard to avoid each other, in acting terms, since they all lined up on
the West End stage in 1983 for the rock and roll musical Yakety Yak.
The new serial, the biggest drama project ever commissioned by BBC
Northern Ireland, was the brainchild of Stephen and Joe. The idea came
to them while they were researching their family tree (the McGanns come
from a strict Catholic background in Toxteth) in Kerry.
It suddenly struck them that the potato famine, the event which more
than any other led to the great Irish emigration through the nineteenth
century, had never before been tackled in a dramatic sense.
They approached the independent production company, Little Bird, who
commissioned writer Allan Cubbit to devise and script an original story.
Stephen McGann said: ''The Famine was a mass disaster and you couldn't
possibly dramatise that. In approaching the project we realised it
needed a central dramatic core. That of one family's history.
''I think Allan (Cubbit) has been very clever. It was very difficult
for him to accommodate four different story lines and four different
brothers evenly. The only way he could do that was to highlight the
differences between us -- no easy task. He's done an exceptional job.''
Joe, at 36 the oldest of the McGanns, plays Sean, the eldest Phelan
son. Describing The Hanging Gale as ''drama with teeth'', he said: ''I
hope it provokes thought and causes people to look further into what
actually happened.''
Being an Irish Catholic family, naturally, one of the Phelans turns
out to be a priest. The role is left to Paul. As Father Liam, he tends
to the starving and the dead and tries to prevent the brutal evictions
of the tenants who can't pay their rent. Opposed to any violence, he
finds his faith tested as he becomes caught up in events which lead to a
final and inevitable tragedy.
He said of his character: ''It's harder to relate to his problems.
What the script tells us is that there are no heroes and it is this that
gives the drama its plausibility.''
The Hanging Gale also features Michael Kitchen as Townsend, a
well-intentioned land agent who tries hard to be fair to his tenants but
is overtaken by events. The character, explains Kitchen, stands out as a
loner.
''He is a very contained person, removed from the rest of the drama.
He arrives in Donegal assuming this is just a job. I don't think he had
any idea what he was getting into,'' he said.
Starting on ITV at precisely the same moment as The Hanging Gale is
The Governor, a feature-length opening episode to Lynda La Plante's new
six-parter. It stars Janet McTeer as Helen Hewitt, at 33 the youngest
woman ever to be placed in charge of a high security, all-male prison.
La Plante came up with the concept after she was invited to give a
talk to the inmates of Devizes Prison. After her lecture she met the
governor -- 33-year-old Alison Gomme -- which prompted her to ask the
classic writer's question ''What if . . . ?''
The storylines for the series (there is a running story through it but
each episode can be viewed as a self-contained drama) are fictionalised
accounts of true-life stories involving prisoners from all categories.
La Plante went into the project expecting to take the side of the
prisoners. However, she found herself with increasing respect for the
prison authorities.
''On the whole they are nice people doing a hard job. What they're
trying to do is a thankless and superhuman task, and I want to make the
public aware of this,'' she said.
In Sunday night's opening episode, Hewitt arrives to take over the
fictional Barfield Prison, recently torn apart by an explosive riot. She
sets about earning the respect of her (mostly male) prison officers and
also proving to the prisoners that she's not afraid to take control.
When she investigates the death of a prisoner she uncovers a layer of
deceit. Hostility and intimidation make her strive to get to the truth
-- and the truth is a deeply shocking revelation that could threaten her
position as governor.
The third of this week's new dramas -- and perhaps the best -- is The
Politician's Wife (Channel 4, Tuesday) starring Trevor Eve as a ruthless
Tory minister whose career is threatened by a sex scandal and Juliet
Stevenson as his revenge-seeking wife.
There's political fiction again on Thursday as John Thaw makes a
welcome return to our screens, recreating his acclaimed stage role as
the Rt Hon George Jones, MP, leader of the Labour Party, in an
adaptation of David Hare's The Absence Of War (BBC2). With Richard Eyre,
who directed the play at the National Theatre, again at the helm, and
with the same supporting cast, Hare has cut 45 minutes from the script.
Thaw, who could play a doorhandle in a movie and still make it
compulsive viewing, is utterly convincing as the decent socialist
politician who reunites his party after a bitter internecine war. But
then, when he finds himself in the middle of a General Election battle,
he finds it increasingly difficult to maintain his honesty and
integrity. Unmissable.
* IT'S boots-and-saddles time as Channel 4 launches a stunning
six-part documentary series on the old West this week. The Wild West
(parts one and two will be shown on Sunday and Monday respectively)
charts the history of the American frontier, concentrating on the tragic
clash of cultures which occurred as Native Americans struggled for
survival in the face of invasion and domination by migrant whites from
the East.
The series was written and directed by Ric Burns (who made the
similarly remarkable documentary The American Civil War, shown on BBC2
over Christmas) and it is a beautifully constructed piece of work which
combines archival photographs, period paintings, early motion picture
footage and contributions from historians and writers.
Part one, Westward Ho, opens in 1845 when less than 20,000 whites
lived west of the Mississippi. The land beyond the ''permanent Indian
frontier'' was deemed a foreign and untameable wilderness to which
Americans in the east had no legal claim.
Then they discovered gold in California and all bets were cancelled.
Fifty years later the buffalo had gone, the Indian wars had all but
destroyed the native race, and the whites were turning the whole
inglorious period into fantasy and myth.
Burns gives not only life but a stark reality to the legendary figures
of the period -- Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, Custer, Sherman,
and Cody. This was where the American dream started . . . and finished
in a nightmare barely half-a-century later. A brilliant, breathtaking
series.
* A WARTS-AND-ALL profile of Britain's pop industry is provided in a
new documentary series, The Music Biz (BBC2, Monday). Part one, The
Deal, examines the way artists' lives are dominated by contracts,
contrasting the mega-deals struck by acts like Madonna and Prince with
the reality behind the fine print which lies in wait for the new kids on
the block.
The series suggests that many top bands end up in, well, dire straits
as the cost of recording and making promo videos are recouped from their
royalties by the huge record companies. The series features candid
contributions from, among others, George Michael, Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce
Springsteen and Billy Joel.
The latter comments: ''I doubt if there is any artist that has any
kind of longevity in the business who got away without being burned.''
* THE good news is that this week sees the final episode of the
current series of Peak Practice. The bad news is that it's coming back
next year. There will, however, be some radical surgery performed on
this medi-drama before it returns to our screens.
Amanda Burton (Dr Beth ''It's-being-so-cheery-that-keeps-me-going''
Burton) and Kevin Whately (Dr Jack ''I-wish-I'd-stayed-with-Morse''
Kerruish) have left the show, apparently because they were worried that
it was going to be turned into a twice-a-week soap. They'll be replaced
by, among others, Larry Lamb, and Simon Shephard (Dr Will Preston) will
play a more leading role.
* THERE is a golden rule among us television previewers that you
should always try to avoid mentioning repeats and feature films. Still,
what's the point of rules if you can't break them now and again. Thanks
to the fact that the BBC are a wee bit strapped for cash these days,
they've decided to rerun the entire 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers (BBC1,
Sunday). It's something called style, Sybil.
Having mentioned a repeat, I might as well get hung for a sheep as a
lamb and mention a film. The thoroughly enchanting Field of Dreams (ITV,
Wednesday), in which Iowa farmer Kevin Costner builds a baseball park in
his cornfield (''If you build it they will come'') is well up there in
this writer's top 10 movies of all time.

ABANDONING his regular daytime garb -- spats, trilby, Old Harrovian
tie -- comic seer Phil Kay slipped into a speedway racer's one-piece
leathers, hopped aboard a snarling dirt-track bike, and brandished a
street-hockey stick at our intrepid photographer, writes DAVID BELCHER.
Why?
''Because I wish everyone intending to come to my shows at the Tramway
on Sunday and Monday night to bring some sports-related item with them.
Parallel bars; a snooker table; the Hampden roar. Anything of that
nature.'' Why?
Because Phil will be plucking such objects out of the audience and
then improvising fresh and funny webs of sports-related mirth around
them. He has done likewise before, his previous audience-donated themes
having been Water and France And All Things French.
Fifty Pound Notes would be good things to be inspired by, I told Phil,
suggesting that he insist his audiences throw them on to the stage. Phil
glared at me. Plainly, I was not being a good sport.

ALISON KERR in celebration of Lorenz Hart, whose centenary is
commemorated this weekend
PERHAPS ''Poet of Broadway'' would be a bit of a fanciful description
for many of the song-a-day writers working in the music factory of Tin
Pan Alley, but there couldn't be a more accurate job title for Lorenz
Hart, whose centenary is commemorated by Radio 2 tomorrow night.
As one half of the most innovative songwriting teams of the 1930s,
Hart wrote lyrics which have been performed by everyone from Maurice
Chevalier to Frank Sinatra; from Doris Day to Chet Baker. With his
career-long writing partner, the composer Richard Rodgers, he created
masterpieces which quickly transcended the often forgettable shows for
which they were originally penned.
His lyrics were all endowed with an honesty of emotion (Unrequited
love's a bore and I've got it pretty bad/ But for someone you adore,
it's a pleasure to be sad) and a clever use of the venacular (I'm a
sentimental sap that's all/ What's the use of trying not to fall?) -- a
combination which made them both accessible and instantly memorable.
Hart was born in New York and began writing poetry and prose in his
teens. At Columbia University, he studied journalism and soon had a
reputation as a versifier of considerable wit. This skill was developed
during the summers he spent as an entertainer at a boys' camp. He met
Rodgers -- who was 10 years his junior -- in 1918. The early years of
their collaboration saw them serving a bizarre apprenticeship: between
1919 and 1924 they were commissioned to provide scores for such diverse
organisations as the Free Scholarship Fund of the New York Child Labour
Committee and the Park Avenue Synagogue.
The first Rodgers and Hart song to be published was Any Old Place With
You, and its typically original lyrics brought them some attention. In
1922, still waiting for their Broadway break, they started work on an
uncommissioned musical called Winkle Town.
Of the 16 songs, many eventually wound up in subsequent shows, and one
in particular catapulted them into demand on Broadway. That song,
Manhattan, was co-opted from Winkle Town into a small revue scheduled to
play for one weekend at the Garrick Theatre in 1925. The resulting revue
-- The Garrick Gaieties -- in fact ran for over 200 performances.
Thereafter, the commissions didn't stop coming. The late 1920s produced
songs like Thou Swell and Mountain Greenery, but it was the 1930s when
the team really hit their stride.
In 1931, the pair switched their attention to Hollywood, where the
full-scale musical genre was in its formative stages. Rodgers and Hart's
first film score was for the now-forgotten Hot Heiress, in which
construction worker Ben Lyon sang: A girl can love an actor, a lawyer or
contractor, but nobody loves a riveter but his mother.
The following year they produced what became their most celebrated
Hollywood score -- for the Jeanette MacDonald-Maurice Chevalier romance
Love Me Tonight. Decades before Rex Harrison talked his way through
songs in My Fair Lady, Rodgers and Hart invented what they termed
''rhythmic dialogue'': rhymed passages were delivered as speech in time
to the music.
Involvement in nine more films followed before 1935, but none of them
was such an all-round success as Love Me Tonight; the highlights and
most enduring aspects of them being the songs. You Are Too Beautiful,
Easy to Remember and Blue Moon all came from this period.
The return to Broadway in 1935 was clearly the change that Rodgers and
Hart needed. It heralded the peak of their joint career. Every show --
and they worked on one a year until 1940 -- brought some kind of
innovation to the musical comedy, and every score was peppered with
tunes which are still played today. Jumbo, Billy Rose's circus story
which required the removal of all the seats from the theatre, spawned
the wistful Little Girl Blue and the utterly poetic My Romance; while
Babes in Arms, in 1937, introduced My Funny Valentine, Where Or When and
The Lady Is A Tramp.
Little has been documented about Hart's personal life (although he was
played by Mickey Rooney in the MGM biopic of the pair -- Words and Music
-- in 1948). He was of a nervous disposition, and was notoriously and
constantly disorganised -- the popular image of the songwriter
scribbling lyrics on stamps and such was certainly accurate in his case.
Alcoholism seems to have dominated his later life, which was ridden
with worries about his latent homsexuality. In 1940 he and Rodgers wrote
perhaps their best-loved show -- Pal Joey (featuring Bewitched and I
Could Write a Book), based on John O'Hara's stories.
During the run of Pal Joey, Hart kept disappearing -- no-one, and
especially not Rodgers, knew where. He also found himself unable to work
in concentrated spells. The couple's last show, By Jupiter (which became
their greatest success), was really only completed because Rodgers hired
a Steinway and installed it and himself in a guest room in the hospital
where Hart was drying out. He died, at the age of 48, in 1943.

THE other week when tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton played a Glasgow
concert he revealed that he had been honing his skills for this current
European tour by locking horns with his hero Flip Phillips.
Hamilton had been in Florida for Phillips's 80th birthday party and
told me with some wonderment: ''He was amazing. Actually, the two oldest
guys there, Flip and Milt Hinton, were the guys cracking the whip. All
of us had to try to keep up to their pace . . . ''
Hinton, once the bass player with Cab Calloway and one of the first
black musicians to break down the segregation in the New York radio and
television studios back in the fifties, will be 86 years old next month
and is still playing superbly.
But, naturally, it was Phillips who featured most in the conversation
with Scott Hamilton. Joseph Filipelli, Joe Flip, The Claw or just Flip
Phillips, the name which has gone down in jazz history, though as Scott
pointed out not always for the right reasons.
Flip's famous tenor battles with Illinois Jacquet in the Jazz at the
Philharmonic tours brought both men notoriety as crowd pleasers or,
even, rabble rousers.
But Phillips always had much more to offer. He is a ballad player of
great sensitivity and Hamilton says: ''There should be some kind of
critical re-evaluation for him and Illinois. Back about 10 years ago,
when we made an album together I was really so nervous because he had
worked out all those things for us to play including some originals. I
practised for 16 hours for that date.
''Then I went ito the studio and Flip called one of his own numbers --
he calls it The Claw -- and I couldn't play it. I was seriously
embarrassed.
''It took about half-a-dozen takes before I got it right. Geez, he
makes you work . . . ''
It is that professionalism which has kept Phillips at the peak of his
powers for half a century now.
There was a strange hiatus in his career, a decade of obscurity when
he seemed to walk away from the spotlight, take a day job in Florida,
and leave New York behind.
From dates with Benny Goodman, along with his former Woody Herman pal
trombonist Bill Harris, in 1959 at Basin Street East in New York until
he surfaced at some jazz parties in the seventies there was silence. But
how he came back.
Perhaps a little tentatively at first with releases from Dick Gibson's
Colorado Party when he was with Clark Terry and others and another from
the l970 Pasadena Party when he was superbly lyrical on a song which is
a trademark item for him, Sweet and Lovely.
There was an album on the Choice label next after he had appeared at
Michael's Pub in New York and Mickey Crane (piano), Milt Hinton, and
drummer Mousey Alexander made that one memorable.
That was in 1975 and the re-discovery was under way. Sometime in the
late seventies he came to London. I went down twice to a short-lived
club, The Canteen in Covent Garden, to hear him. He provided an object
lesson in ballad playing and as well as a bunch of London tenor players
Al Cohn came in one night to stand at the bar and pay his own homage to
the Godfather of New York saxophonists.
Now people are realising how great Flip has been. A recent album with
strings, arranged by Dick Hyman, lets him loose on a whole bunch of
ballads, the ''pretty songs'' he likes. The title track is superb but
every number is handled with Phillips's inimitable taste.
As another tenor player, Frank Tiberi once commented: ''Flip made me
pay attention to the lyrics as well as the melody. He has always done
that, hey, you know what, all that feeling, he's like an opera singer .
. . ''
Flip must have liked that compliment. Perhaps even more he would like
to have his proper place in jazz history. The way he has been playing
for these last 20 years that is the least the man deserves.

A veteran of the battle of lyrics that is the Eurovision Song Contest,
Bob Flynn recommends tuning in, and even a flutter -- just don't put
your shirt on Britain's entry
CONFESSION -- I have attended two Eurovisions, actually sat tuxdoed
and boxed in by roaring viking-helmeted Norwegians, frantic Spaniards,
and Union Jack-waving Brits, in Norway and Dublin. It had to come out
some time, like an AA meeting, the first step is to admit it.
My baptism of Euro-glitz was as a fledgling post-punk reporter in
Norway, their nul-point record having been smashed the year before when
they won with something best forgotten (La Det Swinge performed by
Bobbysocks, if you must know), and they said there had been dancing in
the streets of Oslo and Bergen. But I had my best cynical sneer primed
and ready from the moment I entered Bergen's Greig Hall press reception
area and was handed a press pack which included a large rectangular
polystyrene container which could only be carried, like a violin, under
the arm.
Trying to retain my crumbling cool in the face of hundreds of
appallingly elegant delegates and the organisational enormity of it all,
I asked what was in the box. I was told by a stunning, smiling, Nordic
blonde that it was a whole Norwegian salmon; everyone got one, very good
with squeezed lemon. You can't fight it, not with a salmon under your
arm; you get swept up in the nonsense, the ludicrous glitzy buzz, the
anxious happiness and feeling that you are in a blend of a European
summit and Disneyland.
Not long afterwards, in Dublin, I did it again. But I had the perfect
excuse of interviewing the latest, and reasonably hip, Irish
chart-breakers, Hot House Flowers, whose video for their new single was
mysteriously part of 1988's Eurovision programme. But just before three
hours of live cringing began, The Wogan walked amongst us, so close I
could have touched the hem of his tan, the high priest of Eurovision in
full broadcasting black tie. And He will be there again this year, for
his 15th year of snide yet comfy TV quips, his 24th if you count his
radio coverage.
Back in his homeland for the third successive year, where Eurovision
seems to have taken root after another Irish win, The Wogan, TV gold on
legs, will stride the Euro Village, stepping over miles of cabling from
almost every country you can think of outside the USA; ironic in that
Eurovision could have been created for and by the Americans, the
outrageous costumes and the gleaming smiles right up their competitive,
award-conscious street.
Ireland began serious Eurovisioning in 1970, when the 18-year-old Dana
beat the equally winsome Mary Hopkins into second place and a smoothie
Spaniard called Julio Inglesias into fourth. Julio, I should add, forgot
the words to his own song halfway through; if only he would have
forgotten the words to all his later songs the world would have been a
better place.
But the Irish winning repetition is all Johnny Logan's fault, the
Irish Euro-star who is the only person to have won three Eurovisions.
Even when he stopped singing for his country, he kept composing the
perfect Euro-vehicle, his last being Why Me? -- exactly -- sung by the
unforgettable Linda Martin. Who?
But it was the Irish who injected hi-tech production values and
quality interval acts like Hot House Flowers and last year's incredibly
successful dance/music concoction, Riverdance (coming your way soon as a
full-blown theatre experience) and transformed the spangly dinosaur into
something that is acceptably camp and horribly fascinating. The irony is
that this year's Irish entry, Dreaming, sung by Eddie Friel from
Belfast, has a cloud of litigation hanging over it, a local songwriter
publicly denouncing it as a near copy of one of his early-seventies
compositions. He has threatened to sue, but only if it wins. The world
is agog.
Okay, it's an easy target, distilled light entertainment, but like it
or not this is the biggest TV event of the year with a predicted
audience of 700 million Euro-wide and beyond. In a world of seriously
fragmenting television and European disharmony this is one of the few
remaining communal viewing experiences, barring World Cups and Olympics.
In the old days Eurovision was one of the first techno-marvels of TV
communication, smiling people from a baffling evening-dressed European
world called Luxembourg, ruled over by Katie Boyle, came crackling over
lines of static to deliver scores for pop songs. A stranger concept it
would be hard to conjure but it has outlived an avalanche of continuous
scorn and grown ever-bigger with more countries lining up to enter.
Only by being there can you appreciate just how enormous this thing
is; the armies of press and delegates only equalled, in my experience,
by the hordes of the Cannes film festival. And there is genuine
excitement -- honest -- generated in the auditorium by representatives
of countries where it is taken very seriously indeed. Occasionally
symbolic stances are taken and there is more to the appearance of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia than sequins and songs.
Meanwhile, the week of intensive rehearsing and partying, the build-up
to Saturday's event, includes, for the first time, a special train
journey in Ulster, a ''peace train'' filled with Eurovisionaries. You
laugh, I know, but a much more sobering thought is that the Bosnian
singer, Davor Popovic, one-time leader of ''Sarajevo's Beatles'',
Indexi, and his composers have made it out of the besieged Sarajevo to
sing for Europe. To consider the froth of Eurovision an arena for
anything remotely political is naively misguided, but at least they are
there, smiling and waving rather than drowning in front of the
televisual eyes of the world.
But this is honest show-biz, entirely positive, populated by shiny,
happy people for over three hours on a Saturday night. Most of Britain
gave up on it as a serious consideration long before Bucks Fizz danced
into the spotlight in 1981, coincidentally in Dublin. Britain, still
referred to as ''Grande'', is fielding a soft-focus, candy-rap thing by
Love City Groove, following the extraordinary series of TOTP-style
contender heats featuring everything from Oasis mimics to 70s
revivalists and Sam Fox in a last-ditch attempt to rescue an ailing
career.
We don't stand a chance, we'll lose outright. Who cares? It's the
innocence we are after. Eurovision has survived because it has always
been bright, high-octane show-biz, signifying nothing apart from
throwing up, excuse the expression, the occasional ongoing mega-act such
as Abba, in 1974, and the most recent, Celine Dion, in 88. The rest are
out in the bargain bins of Why Me?-land. Filled with laundered music, it
has a comforting cross-nation feel of friendly rivalry and you may find
yourself sneaking back from the pub to see the last tear-stained
minutes, or even the whole thing. If so, consider this; the opening
sequence is directed by a hot young documentarist, Alan Gilsenan, who
tells me it will be a journey across Ireland, mixing myth, documentary
footage and sampled music from the likes of U2 and The Cranberries and
sounds more Zoo TV than Eurovision. But no matter what starry filmic
heights he may achieve in the future, he will most probably never reach
a bigger audience than in the introductory two minutes to Eurovision 95
. . . the horror, the horror.
Betting tip: The word is that Norway, oh yes, are the favourites (my
own hopes lie with Russia's Lullaby For Volcano) possibly due to the
fact that the band, Secret Garden, are a Norwegian-Irish combo formed
after Rolf Lovland met Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry at last year's
contests. Now where did I put that salmon?

I'M very interested in reunions, wrote about one once, and then
somehow felt absolved from ever trying the real thing. But the reunion
which was the subject of Ribbons and Revelations (R4) sounded so
extraordinary I wanted to have been there because it came across as a
historical tableau vivant of American Women's lives across the century.
Imagine 2000 alumnae arriving for one weekend at Smith College, the
prestigious and largest women's university in the States: women from
their twenties to their nineties swapping notes. (The banners tried to
suggest the span ''From kitchen slaves to microwaves'' ''From eclairs to
affairs.'') The Class of Nancy Reagan and the Class of Sylvia Plath. How
bizarre. Robert Altman could have done one of his great conversation
panning movies of this gala . . .
Women from the Class of 44 talking of their beaux, of how reading
Galsworthy and the Forsyte Saga fuelled their randiness, which meant
their husband-seeking. ''We all got married to have sex.''
The women of the Class of 69 -- the ''cusp'' class shifting from
''straight'' to revolutionary in the twinkling of a term.
The Class of 74 of feminism -- Betty Freidan of Feminine Mystique,
Gloria Sondheim of Ms Magazine.
With hilarious and painful honestly the conversations were of cringing
comparisons and how one-upmanship was left on the whole to male
reunions. Obviously there must have been boasters and braggers around
but Julia Mackenzie concentrated on the interesting ones. (A woman
defining how well she was doing: ''My house burned down. My 16 year old
can't read.'')
Neil Biswas' Hardly Touching (R4) was a moving and sure-footed play
which told the story of a young British Asian couple whose recent
arranged marriage was having problems. Indra, the husband, is critical
of what he sees as the inability of his parents' generation to allow
their children their own explorations and adjustments. He appears, in
his insistent questioning of Angelica, his wife, to harbour doubts as to
the very validity of arranged marriages. So far so simple, thinks the
listener. The more westernised husband having done the traditional thing
is niggled by the memory of past freedoms, while the woman never having
dated at college and culturally passive is confused by his distance and
physical coldness.
It is difficult, even with liberal empathy, for those outside this
world not to view an arranged marriage with horror. The arguments for
the practice as being more children-protective than arbitrary datings
with strangers I understand intellectually but resist emotionally and
morally.
When interrogated by Indra of what she was feeling during the
preliminary meetings and coffee sessions she talks simply of her
preference for him above the others, but later and engagingly she talks
of her ''little girl's dream'' of growing gradually, with delicacy, to
love someone, as opposed to what she makes sound like the grabby
immediacy of fancying someone.
But the tension between the couple is not a simplistic dramatised
debate of western versus traditional tendencies. The further
complication is that the ''deal'' behind the marriage, behind Indra's
acceptance is that his father, a respected priest figure in the
community who has been physically abusing his wife and children for
years, should finally end their torture in return for Indra's sacrifice.
(It's not all as melodramatic as it sounds,: the play is very funny
too.) When the beatings continue, Indra publicly denounces him and the
reverberations through the family and community are deftly shown.
Loyalty was also the subject of a neat short story by Dina Mehta,
Absolution (R4). Her prose is wry but simple seeming. This was a kind of
Roald Dahl revenge story with the nastiness replaced literally with
flowers; a constantly cheated-on wife has for years understood that
after an unfaithful night there will be flowers on the breakfast table.
One morning the dutiful Sita reciprocated the gift . . .

SARA-KATE Templeton writes on the difficulties involved in attracting
British students to participate in the Erasmus exchange programme with
Europe (April 25).
The University of Strathclyde has considerable experience in this
field. We are one of the most significant UK participants in Erasmus
with 1061 of our students involved in a variety of European exchange
programmes over the last three years.
In addition, some of Strathclyde's most successful degrees depend on
the student spending part of the course in Europe.
In the case of this institution, the statement in the article that
''British students cannot be persuaded to study abroad'' is erroneous.
Our capacity to encourage greater outward mobility than seems to be the
case elsewhere is probably related to two key factors: first, the
university itself provides focused and integrated development of
language skills for undergraduates; secondly, the Scottish system of
broad-based secondary education allows for science/technology/language
combinations to a greater extent than the more narrowly-based A-level
curriculum south of the Border.
It should also be emphasised that greater emphasis on language alone
by the British Government will not necessarily produce increased student
mobility to Europe.
A recent survey of some of our students who have decided not to study
abroad for part of their course suggests that a major constraint is the
increased cost of studying in Europe. As in so many other areas of
student life in the 1990s, the financial factor is crucial.

IAN McCONNELL is correct in reporting my concern about the effects a
change of government may have on public interest considerations for the
accountancy profession (Ernst and Young wants independent regulator, May
9). However, he misunderstands me in reporting that I have a particular
concern with utilities.
As I have said on more than one occasion, all organisations with a
public interest dimension, in whatever sector, must be constantly
vigilant to the changing expectations in corporate governance.
My own institute fully supports the main thrust of the Auditing
Practices Board's The Audit Agenda and its proposals, inter alia, to
sharpen the processes by which public interest entities appoint
auditors, how audit fees are set, and how decisions are taken to ward
non-audit services.

AS the producer and director of the Lockerbie film, The Maltese Double
Cross, I am writing in response to the very serious smears from Michael
O'Brien (May 12) and to make some observations.
First, as I have repeatedly made clear, the film was not, as O'Brien
claims, financed by Libya. It was initially funded by Lonrho and
latterly by Tiny Rowland.
It is a matter of public record that Lonrho and Rowland have financial
ties to Libya. Having worked at the Observer when owned by Lonrho I was
well aware of this fact. For this reason, when agreeing to make the
film, it was particularly important to set the condition that I always
set, that I should have absolute independence to pursue the
investigation.
My track record in making similar films speaks for itself. It is worth
noting that the US authorities have previously accused me of being
funded by the KGB . There was never any attempt tp interfere with the
investigation and Mr Rowland did not see the film until it was
completed.
Secondly, the people that Mr O'Brien characterises as ''primary
'expert' sources'' were nothing of the kind. I have stated many times
that everything in the film is independently sourced and that the three
people O'Brien chooses to attack are not key witnesses.
We have both documentation and other witnesses, who did not appear in
the film, to back up what they say. Moreover, we have a filmed interview
with a relative of one of the members of the Jafaar family, who confirms
that his relative, Khalid Jafaar, was duped into taking the bomb on the
plane.
Why does O'Brien choose to ignore this? The reason is that he has no
answer to it. Instead he chooses to smear people in order to divert
attention away from the shocking truth that US Government agencies
colluded in the murder of 270 people at Lockerbie.
To deal with the smears in turn. The claim that Juval Aviv lied about
having been in a Mossad hit squad and that he was only ever a junior
security officer for Pan Am in completely undermined by FBI documents
obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act. These show that in the
1980s the FBI believed Aviv was still an active Israeli agent.
Furthermore, correspondence just released by Aviv shows that he was a
confidential informant for the FBI for about 10 years from 1982 onwards.
What would be the point of the FBI paying him for information if he was
only ever a junior security officer?
Lester Coleman was not a ''low-level informant'' of the US Drugs
Enforcement Administration and the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was a
full-time employee, and has ample evidence to prove it.
As for bragging to a journalist that he invented the story that Khalid
Jafaar was a drug courier (something independently confirmed by the
Jafaar family in Lebanon), this claim was only ever made by one
''journalist''.
In fact this person is not really a journalist at all. He is a
self-styled survival expert and in the eighties was a hanger-on of
Oliver North's gung-ho Georgia Mafia. The last place he cropped up was
supplying camouflage suits to the Michigan Militia.
As for Oswald Lewinter, he was never convicted for impersonating a
Marine Corps officer. He was a first lieutenant in the Marines and on
one occasion, after a particularly traumatic spell in the Korean war,
which incidentally won him a medal for gallantry, he got a free flight
on a military plane while not travelling under orders. He admitted the
technical violation of military regulations, but in the event was
pardoned.
It is true that Lewinter was arrested in London for extortion in 1971.
At the time he was on a covert CIA mission to undermine Freddie Laker's
airline operation. If he was guilty, why was he not convicted? O'Brien
does not give a reason. In fact it was due to the intervention of the
intelligence services.
The fake credentials which he had on him at the time were supplied by
the CIA, which again explains why he was not convicted for fraudulently
possessing them. He still has the Knights of Malta papers and other
CIA-supplied fake passports, including ones for the Vatican and Burundi.
On the matter of October Surprise, once again O'Brien is economical
with the truth. As we explained in a briefing paper about Lewinter, that
was distributed when the film was first shown at the House of Commons in
November, Lewinter was paid by supporters of George Bush's 1988
presidential election campaign to spread lies about October Surprise in
order to undermine the credibility of stories that were surfacing in the
media about the scandal.
Lewinter told the congressional investigators that he had made up
everything about October Surprise because he had been told that the
Democratic Party had made a back-room deal with the Republicans to bury
the issue.
In fact he has documentary evidence to show that October Surprise did
take place and he has made a further statement to a German journalist
which explains why he gave an inaccurate testimony to Congress.
There is also a lot more to Lewinter's 1985 drug conviction than
O'Brien reveals. As we show in the full-length version of The Maltese
Double Cross, Lewinter set up the drug shipping operation under
instruction, in order to raise money for Oliver North's clandestine
activities. The money was provided through the military banking system
in Germany.
At the same time he created a paper trail which made it appear that
the drugs were being imported by the Libyan Government. Lewinter managed
to obtain his case file from the German authorities.
We have copies of the documents, which bear the stamp of the Federal
police in Baden Wurtemburg. We also have a copy of a 9mm pistol permit
which bears the stamp of the provost marshal of a US military base.
The street value of the drugs that he imported to the US was massive
-- around $350m -- so is it not strange that he served less than two
years when his co-defendants got anything between 12 and 27 years?
The reason is that the judge received a classified letter from the
prosecutor, Rudy Gulianni, in which Gulianni explicitly states that
Lewinter was running a top-secret operation on behalf of the US
Government and should therefore be given a lenient sentence. We have
seen the letter.
O'Brien also conspicuously avoids mentioning that Lewinter was used by
a BBC series on the CIA, which was made with the agency's blessing. On
that occasion he was put in touch with the series's producers by the
German Secret Service.
O'Brien mentions that both Aviv and Coleman have been indicted. In the
case of Coleman's passport charge we have documentary proof that the FBI
has fabricated evidence. The other charges, in both cases, relate to
alleged offences dating back to 1991.
Is it not strange that Coleman's perjury indictment was not brought
until four days before his book about Lockerbie, The Trail of the
Octopus, was published in September, 1993? Is it not also strange that
Juval Aviv was not indicted for patently trumped-up fraud charges until
the week before The Maltese Double Cross was due to be screened?
Fabricated charges and Government-sponsored smears; the campaign to
keep the lid on the awful truth about Lockerbie is reminiscent of those
terrible East European dictatorships that we heard so uch about until
the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The fact that the Scottish Crown Office chose to ape the smears, in a
carbon-copy statement issued about the film on Wednesday, should be of
grave concern to all Scots who care about truth and democracy.

BRUCE SANDISON ought to realise that the only way in which the
management of salmon and migratory trout can be carried out with the
power of statute is by means of a district salmon fishery board (April
27).
However well angling clubs are run, and many are very well run, they
do not have the legal status of a district board, and in many places
their interests do not extend to the whole catchment.
In terms of the Salmon Act, 1986, a board has responsibility for the
protection or improvement of fisheries in order to increase the stock of
salmon in its district.
Some boards may not have done this as well as they should in the past
but there is a new attitude developing in Scotland on the wide subject
of fishery management which Bruce Sandison ought to know about,
exemplified by the work of a number of very able fishery biologists and
supported by the efforts of progressive boards.
The work of the research scientists is being converted into practical
steps which fishery managers can take, and carefully prioritised
objectives are now a regular part of plans for the future well-being of
many of our rivers.
He should recognise that landowners, who have established baronial
rights to salmon fishings, lost the value of that asset when society
chose to pollute the rivers and build impassable dams. The return of
salmon to their fishings will not lead to a ''useful financial addition
to their private property'', but rather a reinstatement of the value of
their assets which was taken from them.
There is provision in the Salmon Act, 1986, for representatives of
salmon anglers within a district to become members of the board. Bruce
Sandison may not know that there are such representatives on many boards
and if a board is formed for the Southern Lower Clyde then the
opportunity for angling representatives will be there, as laid out in
the Act.
Finally, it is a pity that Bruce Sandison should adopt such a negative
approach to his subject which contrasts with the positive effort being
made to improve our salmon rivers by able managers who are bringing an
objective approach to the enhancement of stocks.
There is no reason why a similar objective approach should not be
adopted by the proposed Southern Lower Clyde District Salmon Fishery
Board.

THE quality image of Scotch Beef has been called into question by
supermarket chief Sir Alistair Grant as being a somewhat out-dated and
historic concept (May 8). This is not surprising as the conditions for
all the factors that govern meat quality have changed during the last 30
years.
Beef quality, including taste and flavour, is governed by three
factors -- breed, feed,, and post-slaughter treatment.
Fast maturing cattle such as the native Aberdeen-Angus and Beef
Shorthorn have been replaced by lean ''exotics'' from Europe, while the
dairy industry, from which a substantial proportion of our beef is
derived, is now dependent on the hard, lean Holstein for its main dairy
breed.
Traditional rations based on roughage, swedes, and a little
concentrates have now changed to high-cereal-based feeds.
The hanging and tenderising of carcasses for a substantial period
after slaughter was given up in the interest of quick profit, though
this is beginning to change again.
If beef consumption is on the decline, then the emphasis should be on
quality rather than quantity as a means of halting that decline. The
Government should consider radical measures, for example subsidising
dairy farmers to use a dual-purpose breed such as the Red Poll which
even on its own, without crossing, provides quality beef. Its longevity
and hard-wearing qualities are legendary.
Further top-crossing with the Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford should
ensure the provision of top quality beef without recourse to high cereal
feeding. In a world where population is rapidly increasing, cereals will
have priority with human beings instead.

FOR Duncan Bryson's edification (Language of Robert the Bruce, May 5),
the Bruce was a sixth or seventh generation Scot. His claim to the
throne of Scotland (and that of Balliol) was based on his descent from
the Celtic line into which his forebears had married.
The myth is that the Normans were French. They were not. Originally
they were Norsemen whose native tongue was one of the Scandinavian
languages.

ALLAN Francovich's The Maltese Double Cross (Channel 4, Thursday) was
a long haul, but that's no reproach. In the matter of the Lockerbie
massacre only the truth, every particle of it, can give a semblance of
meaning to an act that beggared belief.
Does Francovich have the truth? The orchestrated attempts to discredit
his work over the past fortnight could be interpreted as a kind of
negative validation. He says Britain and America have much to hide; they
say neither his witnesses nor his sponsors can be trusted. It is a mad
version of the Cretan syllogism: all Cretans are liars; I am Cretan;
therefore . . .
Here they were all Cretans, denying they had lied.
The tone of the documentary admitted to few doubts, however, perhaps
reflecting the pressures put on its maker even before he set to work.
One plain fact -- a rarity in this affair -- is that the governments of
the UK and the US simply did not want this film to be made. Francovich's
response, reflected in the commentary, was a kind of bravado, a
self-righteousness under siege.
His certainty was troubling. This, the piece seemed to say at every
turn, was why they tried to stop us -- and this, and this, and this . .
. It was as though official resistance to his thesis had itself proved
his arguments.
But that attitude, as we know, is a vice of conspiracy theorists the
world over.
Yet it is easy to say why ''They'' might have wanted the documentary
stopped, and why they want it to be discredited now. If even some of
Francovich's charges are true -- foreknowledge of the bomb threat being
chief among them -- senior politicians and their officials were guilty
of complicity in capital crimes.
For a viewer coming fresh to the scene, the story must have been
baffling. Iran, Libya, Syria, Lebanon; a cast of spooks, terrorists,
drug-dealers, arms-dealers, policemen, and scientists; dozens of dates
and dozens of places. Even with some knowledge of the myriad claims and
counter-claims, you were obliged to concentrate. How many did, one
wonders? So does Francovich have the truth? Is Libya being pilloried for
geo-political reasons; were the Lockerbie victims allowed to die; has
there been a cover-up? His film had an internal logic that made its
claims seem undeniable.
All the pieces fitted, each of the motives were identified. In its own
terms, not least when set beside official refusals to take any of its
claims seriously, this was a powerful and plausible film.
But coherence of itself is never enough. Good plays have logic, good
novels make sense, and all good TV thrillers name the villains in the
end.
That does not prevent them from being fiction.
This reviewer suggests only that Francovich's story is more plausible
than the official version. Until his opponents in government emerge from
behind the cover of legal process and rebut it point by point The
Maltese Double Cross will continue to grow in credibility. Three cheers
for Channel 4, in the meantime, for having the guts to screen it.
The meaning of death was a feature of the week, needless to say, and
for the most part television handled the VE Day anniversary ceremonials
with grace and dignity. As always, one could have done without Cliff
Richard, but the truly offensive moment was no fault of the
programme-makers.
Monochrome was the signal we were going back in time. Flags and
bunting and quaint costumes said we were in 1945. A mournful mother and
child sat together on a step while others celebrated and a voice-over
spoke of sadness in their eyes. Yet all was well, of course it was;
daddy marched home, and many people were briefly reminded of their own
experiences.
A charity appeal? The trailer for a documentary? Actually a revolting
advert, shameless in its vacuous opportunism and its absolute lack of
taste, for BT, reminding us that ''it's good to talk''.
Terry Waite, a man who once talked too much to the wrong people, and
who doesn't like to talk about that now, sidled on to drag in news of
Ireland, South Africa, and the Middle East (more ''talking'', you see).
Here was the patriotic struggle to keep Sir Iain Vallance in the salary
to which he has become accustomed. If evidence were needed of how much
Britain has changed for the worse, this was it.
In contrast, as gold is to base metal, was the Network First
production Last Letters Home (ITV, Tuesday), a piece that involved
nothing more than people talking. That many of them spoke from beyond
the grave in the shape of old, cherished letters was the only point of
Tamasin Day Lewis's film. It needed no other.
These survivals of war, the last messages from those who knew they
would not survive, had a spellbinding eloquence. The words, language won
from native reticence, were imbued with the extraordinary luminescence
that time and memory gives to pain and love. In most cases these were
the thoughts of men about to die, of men talking of little things
realised for the last time, of children, mothers, lovers, pride, and
hope. They did the species more honour than it deserves.
''I've never spoke of these feelings before,'' said one young man who
had thought, before the truth of fascism dawned, of becoming a
conscientious objector, ''and hope never to speak of them again''. She,
bereft for decades, said simply: ''Yes, I expected it. I knew he would
think that way. And it meant a great deal to me.''
There was almost more dignity in these simple exchanges, and in the
faces of those who lived on, than this reviewer could easily bear,
irrelevant though that is. Husbands to wives, brothers to sisters,
fathers to daughters: in these were the true meaning of that war. Last
Letters Home was the anniversary programme of the week.
Bidding, finally, for Not the Programme of the Week, was the
absolutely final episode of Absolutely Fabulous (BBC1, Thursday). Oh
dear. A mess, darlings, absolutely, with the plot-lines for three or
four good episodes stuffed into one, none related to the other, and a
worrying sense that Jennifer Saunders, having auctioned her ''format''
to the Americans, just wanted to get the whole sticky business off her
hands.
Put it this way: in the handbook of comedy cliches it states quite
clearly that any series concluding with a scene ''25 years later'' has
confused a sight gag with an ending. AbFab's splendid monsters deserved
better, as did we.

THE two little King Charles spaniels tumble and play in the sunshine,
oblivious to their imposing surroundings. Only their names -- Ella (as
in Fitzgerald) and Clementina (as in Sobieska) -- suggest owners with a
difference. The spaniels are the pets, respectively, of Catherine and
Flora Maxwell Stuart of Traquair House, Pebblesshire.
It's a fairytale place. A limewashed mansion of asymmetrical design,
it shows its antiquity with its steeply pitched roof, irregular windows,
and inset turrets. There has been a building on the site for 1000 years.
Set in lush wooded country by the Tweed near Innerleithen, Traquair
has all the mystique proper to a spot that has been visited by 27 kings,
and, famously, a queen -- Mary Stuart. Time scales seem different here.
The main gates to the estate have remained closed for 250 years since
the '45 Jacobite uprising.
Steeped thus in history and romance, Traquair could simply be a
mausoleum. Nothing is further from the case. It is very much the centre
of present-day activities, recreational, cultural, and commercial. Flora
Maxwell Stuart and her daughter Catherine preside over its modern
functions without compromising the house's ancient dignity.
It is looking its best just now. The long grass avenue leading to the
locked Bear Gates (snarling stone beasts provide the name) is showing
the first signs of blueing with speedwell. Ranks of tall sycamores are
coming into leaf. Late white daffodils surround the courtyard gates. The
bleating of distant lambs mingles with the squawks of Traquair's restive
peacocks.
Stuarts have owned the house since 1491 (a year before Columbus
discovered the New World) and have left behind both artefacts and
legends. Mary Queen of Scots stayed there in 1566 with her husband
Darnley shortly after the murder of Rizzio.
Flora Maxwell Stuart tells the story of the pair's only recorded
disagreement. ''One night at supper Mary said she didn't want to go
hunting the next day as she thought she might be pregnant. Darnley
turned to her and said, 'What, ought we not to work a mare when she is
in foal?''' Mary's host, Sir John Stuart, rebuked the young husband for
his coarseness.
In the upper floor of the house there is the bed in which the
ill-matched couple slept. The museum room has a shoe of Mary's -- high
heeled, skittish, and remarkably small -- as well as her jewelled
crucifix and rosary.
That other legendary Stuart, the Bonnie Prince, may also have visited
Traquair. Again, Flora Maxwell Stuart explains the background. The
Traquair Stuarts were ''a great Jacobite family''. The Fifth Earl was
very keen to see Charles Edward return to the country and joined a
society which had talks with him in France between 1743 and 1745.
However, when he realised the prince would not have the expected French
support, he didn't want him to come.
Bonnie Prince Charlie did, of course, land in Scotland, And, when he
was based in Edinburgh in the heady days of his campaign, is said to
have visited all his known supporters. The Fifth Earl is supposed to
have walked up the avenue at Traquair with the prince and closed the
gates, saying they would stay shut until a Stuart was king again. ''He
thought that would be in a few months time!''
The last earl died last century and the title was lost as there were
no male heirs. Flora's husband Peter was the twentieth Laird of Traquair
and on his death in 1990 the ownership of the house and estate passed to
her. Flora is currently setting up a maintenance fund to secure the
future of the house and the estate for Catherine and future generations.
Thirty-year-old Catherine -- who marries London design consultant John
Grey this summer -- is in charge of the annual fair at Traquair at the
beginning of August. She explains: ''Basically it encompasses music,
theatre, crafts, complementary medicine, and lots of children's
entertainments.'' Last year it attracted some 6000 people over the
weekend.
Music includes folk and blues and traditional Scottish. And, adds
Catherine, ''mother started a classical garden last year'' -- a trio
from the Scottish Chamber Orchestra playing among the roses. Another
event is a King Charles spaniel tea party.
Yet another staple of the Traquair diary is the annual beer festival
-- which takes place at the end of this month. It may reflect the fact
that there is a flourishing brewery at Traquair. This was started in the
1960s, Catherine explains. The old brewhouse still existed, but was used
as a ''family repository for junk''. When her father cleared it, he
found equipment, dating back to the 1700s.
Her father ''had a background in distilleries'' and started brewing
again. ''To begin with it wasn't very successful,'' Catherine says.
''Nobody had heard of real ale then; the lager revolution had just
started.'' Then with the Campaign for Real Ale, it took off in the
1970s. Traquair House ale is now exported as far afield as Japan and the
United States. Any profits go to maintain the house.
Peter Maxwell Stuart also started the tradition of producing brews for
special occasions, including his own 25th wedding anniversary. There was
a brew for the Stuart anniversary year of 1991. Yet another new brew is
in the pipeline -- Jacobite Ale for the 250th anniversary of the '45.
''We looked at quite a lot of old recipes,'' says Catherine. The result,
spiced with coriander, will be launched at the beer festival on May 27.
Other outdoor activities at Traquair include a sheep and wool day on
the last Sunday in July. This year as the sheep dogs arrive more than
100 classic Indian motorcyles will be leaving as a three-day rally is
being wound up.
A project obviously dear to Flora Maxwell Stuart is the new art
gallery on the top floor of the house. This shows contemporary art.
''You can begin to think that it is only old things that are
important,'' she says. ''It's good to show that new work is still
happening.'' The present show, by Dundee-trained Alison Murdoch, is
uncompromisingly modern with its great orange discs which may be suns,
heads, or circles. This exhibition comes from the Gruzelier gallery in
Hammersmith with whom Flora Maxwell Stuart has a co-operative
arrangement. Last year Traquair showed Norwegian work and sculpture in
the courtyard.
This year ''a very exciting project'' is in the making with Richard
Demarco, who introduced the Maxwell Stuarts to the artist Deryck Healey.
He and two young artists are going to create ''a path of landmark
artwork'' with objects, all based on some design in the house, made from
natural materials. For example, the design on a trunk will be recreated
in the tennis court in fir cones. These ''scultures'' will be yet
another August attraction.
Meanwhile, Traquair has no shortage of things to fascinate visitors,
from its general shop (nursery plants available) and antiques shop to
its lovely little restaurant, adapted from an old cottage and offering
home baking and posies of spring flowers on the tables.
But it is the house itself and its contents that are the star
attraction. Clambering up its chilly stone staircases, you have an
instant sense of the past. Even the drawing room, with its harpsichord
and portrait of Dryden, reveals an older self in the sixteenth-century
painted beams that are exposed at some points of the ceiling.
Curious objects are to be found not only in the museum but scattered
round the house. They range from Napier's Bones (a forerunner of
logarithms) to a primitive painting of Bonnie Prince Charlie wearing
unauthentic tartan and silk hose. ''Very elegant legs,'' says Flora
Maxwell Stuart.

ALTHOUGH by popular, critical, and Oscarly acclaim the two best films
of the past 12 months, the only thing that Quentin Tarantino's
springheeled gangster comedy Pulp Fiction and the all-American simpleton
fable Forrest Gump had in common was that no-one liked them: one so
callously, cheerfully violent, the other so winsomely nice.
No-one, that is, except Couch Potato, whose tastes are so catholic
they make Pius V look like the Grand Master of the Orange Order. Pulp
Fiction (rental, cert 18) and Forrest Gump (rental, cert 12) have since
their recent video releases been such constant rivals for the monopoly
of the Spud Towers video system that they're beginning to merge in our
mind into a single (wheep! wheep! . . . Fancy Critical Vocabulary
Alert!) meta-narrative that wraps the two together like The Brave Little
Toaster with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
On this synthesis we have based a scenario, guaranteed to unite all
temperaments of movie fans at the box office, that Couch Potato is going
to direct, script, and produce as soon as we can save up for the ticket
to Hollywood and get a job at a video store like Uncle Quentin. After a
failed first draft called Pulp Forest (Tom Hanks stars as the holy-fool
leader of an Earth First ecology group trying to save the woodlands of
Oregon, with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson as hitmen hired by the
big bad logging interests), we came up with Gump Fiction, a yarn that
combines all the paint-the-room-red action of Pulp with the feel-good
factor of Gump.
Here ([CPYR] Couch Potato 1995) are some episodes we've roughed out in
narrative.
One: Forrest Gump has become a college football star, despite not
being very bright, because he can run like gangbusters. The mob in Los
Angeles bribes him to lose the next match so that they can make a
killing on the betting, but Forrest plays them false, escapes from the
stadium afterwards, wastes a couple of smalltown sexual sadists with a
pump-action shotgun, steals a motorbike, and persuades hired killers
Vincent Vega and Jules to join him in a shrimp-fishing enterprise.
Pay-off line: ''Hey! Check the big brain on Forrest!''
Two: Forrest pretends to be a gangster and gets to take the Big Boss's
girlfriend, Uma Thurman, out on a date to a rock'n'roll theme restaurant
where they win a prize for freestyle hippie dancing to Scott McKenzie's
If You Go To San Francisco. Uma takes a near-fatal overdose of
strawberry milkshakes and falls in love with Forrest because he still
respects her even after she's honked all over the Cadillac, and calls up
Harvey Keitel to get the mess cleaned off the upholstery. Then Uma
Thurman dies of Aids from some guy she met before Forrest. Pay-off line
(at the funeral): ''Girls are like a box o' choklits . . . you never
know what one's gonna git left in the box.''
Three: Bonnie-and-Clyde kids Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are holding up a
diner at gunpoint when Forrest walks in and persuades them to join him
in a friendly game of table-tennis, then blows them away in a three-way
Mexican standoff provoked by a disagreement about the French words for a
quarter-pound hamburger with cheese. Pay-off line: ''Ezekiel 27,15: And
ye shall know that I am Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee . . . and
who won more Oscars anyway, bitch?''
If you recognise all Couch Potato's allusions, congratulations. If
not, get down to the video store toot sweet and get acquainted with our
sources. At least one of them is a really great movie: which one is up
to you.

HOW do you like living in Glasgow? I was asked recently when I
revealed that I had now lived there for 10 years. I hesitated. The
question in itself convicted me of being an outsider, an East Coaster.
Implicit was the suggestion that I would require to adjust in some way,
and this was of course correct. Yet my hesitation was enough to plant
suspicion in my questioner's mind that I was not sufficiently
wholehearted and immediate in my reply. True Glaswegians require to know
quickly and definitely that you are not one of these Edinbro folk who
looks down his nose at all things Glaswegian.
Of that sin, at least, I am innocent. However, the hesitation was not
accidental. To me, Glasgow embraces the best and the worst of being
Scottish. It is a city of extremes. Not of poverty and riches (albeit
that there are contrasting stardards of living, they are nothing to the
dichotomy between rich and poor in countless cities in Europe and
throughout the world). Glasgow's high and low for me lies in its
aggression and its friendliness.
The latter is legendary. Indeed one might say that it has attained the
status of a myth (largely by being repeated by Glaswegians until they
believe it is the whole story). It has been a great part of the story of
my life here. I don't think there is another city with as high a
proportion of generous, hospitable people, and during my 10 years I have
benefited enormously from that and made friends who are virtually now
like family to me.
There is certainly a grain of truth in the old joke that Glaswegians
invite the unexpected visitor to have tea, whereas in Edinburgh they say
''You'll have had your tea?'' But there are everyday incidents in
Glasgow which show its less agreeable side and are not nearly so common
in the East. The worst area is in serving the public both in the public
and private sectors. Last week I had experience of the best and the
worst of Glasgow in this regard.
The week started with yet another holiday for all the people who work
in the registry office at Martha Street. I don't grudge them their
holiday, but do they all need to take it on the same day? Death is a 365
day per year business, but the dead cannot be buried or cremated until
legal formalities are performed. This means that the registration staff
play a key role in processing arrangements as public servants. Yet at
Christmas and New Year the process grinds to a halt because they will
not work rotas or stagger holidays. We are not dealing here with people
waiting for spare parts for their car, but grieving families who deserve
better from a public service.
Having dealt with bereaved families who have had to put up with
aggression and unhelpfulness from individuals in Martha Street, I cite
this as an example of the less acceptable face of Glasgow, the uncivil
service.
It is not the only one. A couple of years ago a Glasgow restaurateur
wrote an article in this newspaper about the problems the public caused
his staff. It was not the incidents of rudeness by customers which
disturbed me -- these are inexcusable and his staff merited sympathy --
but his own underlying attitude which came over, and this earned him a
few brickbats from Herald readers at the time.
My third example of the best and worst in Glasgow concerns the library
service. Last week I went in search of a book at three South Side
libraries. Staff at one were indifferent, unhelpful, and required many
questions before help was forthcoming. At Pollokshaws it was a world of
difference, and a female member of staff was so helpful that I wondered
if I had been taken up to heaven among the angels. Yet this young woman
was doing the same job, for the same money, under the same conditions as
her colleagues in the other library.
The same is true of the registration offices, I am sure, and there are
many who work in this service and are devoted to helping the public in
any way they can.
I could go on and on, comparing and contrasting one grunting
telephonist with another who has been to charm school. A nippy sweety
receptionist here and a courteous one there. A shop assistant who adds
to the value of the goods he or she sells, with another who doesn't
bother even to look up when a customer enters the shop. I have just
spent a considerable sum upgrading my computer capability and was
treated like someone who had demanded to pay in threepenny pieces.
Why is there superb service in some places in Glasgow and not in
others? The answer lies partly in the different attitudes among those
concerned. But I believe there is another element that prolongs bad
service in Glasgow. It is that Scottish trait which sees service as a
regrettable task rather than an opportunity to benefit others. That is a
very fundamental dichotomy and one which divides the sheep from the
goats, that is, those who believe in meekness towards clients and those
who use head-butting.
The trouble in Glasgow is that the latter approach is not cracked down
upon. Good manners are not insisted upon by supervisors and managers in
some organisations. The truculent and the lazy are not weeded out and
the courteous and diligent rewarded.
This carrot and stick approach may be primitive, but it works. The
trouble is it puts some people out of work and this is a great taboo.
But I would rather live in Glasgow with higher unemployment in which the
Jobshops were manned by people who wanted to help, than one in which
they couldn't care less.

BRITISH business leaders are displaying touches of schizophrenia on
the subject of Mr Tony Blair and the new Labour Party. It is not so much
that they cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality (as in all the
classical descriptions of that distressing mental disorder) but that
they are uncertain as to which category Mr Blair should properly
inhabit. To say this is not to insult business leaders, and specifically
not those from the British Chambers of Commerce who have been holding
their annual convention in Aberdeen in recent days. Rather it is an
acknowledgement that their perceptions of Labour, for so long closed or
at the very least narrowed, have widened sufficiently to admit new
perceptions together with equally new confusions. Businessmen are
traditionally suspicious of politics and politicians. At the beginning
of the conference they had plenty of reason for disgruntlement as Mr
Michael Heseltine had cancelled his promised appearance, to be followed
by cancellations from Mr David Hunt and Mr Michael Portillo, both of
whom had agreed to replace the President of the Board of Trade. This
infuriated the businessmen who saw it as a sign of governmental
disinterest in business. That was unfair, as all three had been detained
in London by the hospitals debate in the Commons.
Whether influenced by Tory defections or not, the convention laid out
a nice red carpet for the Labour leader in the shape of a poll which
showed that some 43% of the delegates believed that a Labour government
would help their businesses, while only 31% believed Labour would damage
their enterprises. BCC officials seemed puzzled by this information from
their own members, acknowledging at first that there was a general
feeling that change would be a good thing, but muttering darkly that
businesses might change their opinions when they had all the details of
Labour's proposed policies. Somewhat incredibly, and in confirmation of
the schizophrenia theme, the BCC chairman insisted that the present
administration had provided stability. Quite how this squares with the
various evidences of fragmentation across the country, from transport
and rail (of vital importance to businessmen) to economic policy (a boon
to exporters, but not every businessman is an exporter), is hard to see.
Retail sales are certainly stable, but not at a level which anybody
likes.
Nevertheless, delegates were in confident mood, as was Mr Blair. His
speech touched several sensitive points with the businessmen, though
much of it dealt in generalisations. It is all very well to set out
seven areas in which a new relationship between party and business can
be developed, but any relationship which goes no deeper than initial
attraction will go nowhere. A BCC official commented that the seven
points were in line with the agenda of British industry, but so is three
meals a day and a good sleep at night. All of them needed more flesh,
and none more so than the endlessly repeated encouragement to investment
and longer-term thinking. How will Mr Blair encourage it where all else
has failed? On the question of the development of a modern
infrastructure Mr Blair proceeded with considerable cunning. Businessmen
have generally not responded well to government exhortations to put
their money into sectors which have previously been financed by
government. Labour's plan is to use public money to lever in private
finance. That is a clever idea, if obvious in retrospect, but we do not
know how it will work. In summation, a future Labour government and the
business community would need each other; both realise this, but the
next task must be to build on the new relationship.

MR CLARKE has turned out to be a far more prudent Chancellor than
might have been expected given his combative personality and rumbustious
style. He has, too, the self-confidence to alter policy decisions after
re-assessing them in the light of new evidence. His running discussions
with the Governor of the Bank of England give him the opportunity and
the flexibility to do so. His decision not to raise interest rates after
their last discussion has been widely criticised, but he can easily come
to a different decision after the next meeting. That decision was a
finely balanced one and both that balance and his perception of it may
change. He is, after all, the person who saddled himself (and presumably
his successors) with the need to consult the Governor regularly, and to
publish the minutes of their discussion within a few weeks of it having
taken place. Mr Lamont, his predecessor, said yesterday that this
regular publication was a mistake since it was bound to focus public
criticism whenever the two men were in disagreement. It was, however, a
welcome step towards open monetary management. It is naive to assume
that those leading great political departments will always agree with
their professional advisers. What matters is the degree of disagreement.
If the assumption is that wherever disagreement exists the will of the
Governor should always prevail a new, and extremely important,
constitutional innovation will have taken place. The Bank of England,
and not Parliament, will have acquired independent responsibility for
monetary policy.
Some people do want such a change, and they include Mr Clarke's two
immediate predecessors. The Opposition is considering the idea, with
some sign of favour, and it does have some attractions. It would, for
example, remove from politicians the temptation to abandon monetary
restraint for electoral convenience. The trouble with that point in a
British context is that it is hard to demonstrate occasions when
Chancellors have deliberately and consciously made such cynical
judgments. Error rather than calculation has been the enemy of British
economic and monetary management since 1945 and it would be a bold man
indeed who would insist that central bankers could always (and uniquely)
avoid all the traps. It is true that the example of the German
Bundesbank is quite inspiring in this area (though even it has been
over-ruled by the Government on occasion), but it operates in a very
different society, and economy, from the UK. Its success may not be too
easily transplanted. Parallels with the American Federal Reserve are not
exact, and that institution's quasi-independent role has not eliminated
American inflation (or prevented the dollar from abrupt declines in
value, especially of late).
The debate about this possible change will not go away, but to the
extent that it involves Parliament in surrendering more power to
unelected officials, it will be resented by a wide range of MPs of all
views and in all parties (except possibly the Liberal Democrats). It is
hardly an issue with much electoral appeal, for it is highly technical;
but it might be the sort of change implemented most easily after a
General Election which also changed the party in Government. If Mr
Clarke's own efforts do not swing things for the Tories in the next two
years -- and there is precious little evidence yet -- that could be a
decision for Labour's Gordon Brown. Would a new and reforming Chancellor
make such a sacrifice of his own powers, and would the Prime Minister
let him?

Christopher Sims considers whether it is time for the discipline of an
independent central bank
WITH the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke apparently facing
his first real disagreement with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, over interest rates, it is time to ask whether Britain would be
better off with a fully independent central bank.
The independence of the Bundesbank from political meddling is often
cited as a key factor behind Germany's economic success. So should we go
the whole hog and leave the control of inflation solely to the Bank of
England?
The trend is towards independence for central banks, and the evidence
points to this being the way to tame the beast of inflation. However, it
is not quite as simple as this.
Germany has a particular obsession with inflation as a result of the
disastrous inflationary bubble of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s. This
resulted in a barrowload of notes being required for a simple purchase.
It wiped out people's hard-won savings and paved the way for the rise of
fascism.
So the Bundesbank is only preaching to the converted when it imposes
tight monetary discipline.
From Britain's perspective, it may appear that this discipline is just
what we need. But without the cultural commitment it would not
necessarily deliver as satisfactory a result. Everybody may decry
inflation as an evil to be stamped out, but in practice home owners have
not fared badly out of inflation as house prices have historically gone
up faster than inflation.
Indeed, it could be argued that a little uptick in inflation is
exactly what is required now to restore the feel-good factor by getting
the housing market moving again and help the 1,500,000 people whose
mortgage exceeds the value of their home. Rising wages often precede the
higher inflation which inevitably follows, so the process can give an
impression of greater prosperity for a time. It is a seductive picture.
Inflation is undoubtedly an economic evil, and yet a little dose would
be naughty but nice, for some.
However, independence does not just mean independence from Government.
It also requires independence from the banking and financial system in
which the Bank of England, at any rate, is firmly embedded. It is the
primary regulator for the City of London, and its top people hob-nob
with the great and the good in financial circles. So an independent bank
may be susceptible to pressure for an easier stance in monetary policy
if the financial sector was under pressure.
All this adds up to the belief that an independent central bank can
only fully deliver the goods if it is embedded in an anti-inflation
culture, and it is far from clear that this is the case in the UK.
Of course, one way of developing the culture is to have an independent
Bank of England showing the way. But if the example of France is
anything to go by, this means accepting a permanent feel-bad factor. The
Bank of France has only recently been given its freedom, but a firm
monetary policy has been followed for nearly a decade now, and for as
many years ordinary people have talked of la crise in the economy.
The Bank of England now enjoys much more freedom, indeed to an extent
undreamed of even five years ago. We now know exactly, albeit in
arrears, what passes between the Chancellor and the governor when they
meet to discuss monetary policy and the bank issues a quarterly progress
report on inflation which is not subject to Treasury vetting.
So doesn't this give all the advantages of an independent Bank of
England without all the constitutional bother of having the bank outside
parliamentary control? After all, no Chancellor can have a blazing row
with the governor without provoking a hysterical reaction in financial
markets.
But the governor does not hold all the aces. He equally cannot afford
to fall out with his Chancellor because of the effect on the markets. So
when push comes to shove he might be more accommodating than he wanted
to be. If Mr George was independent he could push on regardless.
Discipline might hurt at times -- no, would hurt at times -- but it
has been made clear time and again that discipline is what the UK
economy needs and that politicians are incapable of delivering it.

Keats and Buchan, Scott
and Sayers all knew the
rugged charms of Bonnie
Galloway. Andy Murray
and photographer
Edward Jones follow in their footsteps
Nobody ever mentions that
Dumfries and Galloway
is the first Scottish
region not to pump raw
sewage into the sea
FAR too few tourists have sufficient gumption these days to visit
''the land of the stranger-Gaels'' instead of dodging skin cancer in the
shadow of concrete costa condominiums; yet, before the mass predilection
for getting basted on Continental beaches, generations of travellers
were content enough to bask in the penetrating Solway Firth breezes.
Dandering along leafy lanes and clifftops enthralled them more than
any taverna would. Bonnie Galloway, now an underrated swathe of southern
Scotland, magnetised them all.
Galloway is all things to all men. The region's raw charms reminded
the nineteenth-century travel writer Richard Ayton of ''the wild
beauties of Caernarvonshire''; and when he stayed at Auchencairn, John
Keats recorded: ''Kirkcudbright county is very beautiful, very wild,
with craggy hills somewhat in the Westmorland fashion. The country is
very rich - very fine - and with a little of Devon.''
The poet was captivated by the rocky headlands of the Colvend coast,
the sandbanks, the mudflats, the cliffs and the shady coves where
smugglers hid their contraband from the Excisemen, thereby providing
source material for Sir Walter Scott.
I once met a Cornishman who had settled in Galloway, but who felt at
home. ''It's Cornwall minus the Wimpys,'' he confided. The
late-Victorian Glasgow Boys, who established an artists' colony around
Kirkcudbright, called the coastal part of Galloway the Scottish Riviera.
Old guidebooks, the ones which admittedly got the use of superlatives
down to a super-fine art, referred to Galloway as the Southern
Trossachs: so mild was its climate; so brilliant its midsummer light; so
wild and grand its long and stabbing littoral; so formidable those
cairn-strewn Corbetts which inspired Buchan's The Thirty-nine Steps.
When Dorothy Leigh Sayers based one of her detective stories, The Five
Red Herrings, around the towns of Gatehouse of Fleet and Kirkcudbright,
most of Galloway fished or painted, or combined the two. In the
intervening 70 years, fishing has almost disappeared as an industry,
although artists still abound. Sayers' lonely by-ways, moreover, have
been modernised by the likes of the A75 ''Euroroute'' to Ireland.
Not everything has changed, though. Joe Dignam, ''kindliest of
landlords'', to whom the author dedicated her book, is long gone, but
you still get a hearty welcome in most of the pubs in Gatehouse (Sir
Walter Scott's Kippletringan), a picturesquely situated former
mill-town, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year.
Some pockets of Galloway are Little Englands; therefore, you could
transport Campbell, the fictional landscape painter, straight into
Scottish Watch; and Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey would not look out of
place in Gatehouse, since it is a tweedy sort of a place, which would
fit into the Lake District, although it is no less inviting for that.
If I drive west on the A75, the wooded ruins of Cardoness Castle
perched on a twisted knoll, never fail to beckon me to indicate right.
Cliche or no cliche: the visitor from the north who turns off the A75
a bit further west, at Newton Stewart, and heads for the sea, motors
into a bygone age. Look at your map and the Machars are shaped much like
India. Yet there is no Calcuttan melee: the Machars are as sparsely
populated as areas of the Highlands, and as green as Ireland.
''In green places there are angels,'' the commendably idealistic Rev
Andrew Patterson informed me as we strolled along one of the many
narrow, twisting tracks which pass for roads in this pristine
hinterland.
Many species of wild flower beautified the verges, where you would
expect cow parsley and rosebay willowherb. We stood at the top of the
brae and held our breath as the prominent humps of the Galloway hills
struggled out of the haar in the distance.
These hills, none of them big enough to rub shoulders with a Munro,
made ideal beacon-points during the warring times: Criffel, Bengairn,
Cairnsmore of Fleet and Knock of Luce, all had fires lit on their tops
to warn of dangers ahead. Together with Merrick, the Rhinns of Kells,
Corserine, The Dungeon and the Range of the Awful Hand, they constitute
good limbering-up country for Munro-baggers before they head north
again.
But the mini-Alpine grandeur of the Galloway Corbetts would have to
wait. The peninsula we were exploring is as flat as a girdle-scone, but
for the drumlin bumps deposited by the Ice Age: the low-lying land of St
Ninian, the first Scottish saint, who converted the southern Picts from
Whithorn - long before St Columba reached the shores of Iona. Ninian's
Candida Casa, at Whithorn, was Scotland's first Christian church.
''You can see five kingdoms from here: Scotland, where we're standing,
England over there, the Isle of Man, Ireland -- and the Kingdom of
Heaven up there,'' Patterson said with a smile.
As we watched the distant shape of the Isle of Man emerging from the
fog during our walk in the vicinity of Cruggleton Castle, he also took a
delight in revealing that Edward Woodward had been burned on the
headland here in the film The Wicker Man.
Many monarchs, including Robert the Bruce, Mary Queen of Scots and
James IV, visited the shrine of St Ninian. Now thousands of day-trippers
visit the Whithorn Trust. Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board's top
tourist attraction last year, Whithorn is one of the largest excavation
sites in Europe. Be prepared for real skeletons, though.
Andrew Patterson has spent seven years, first as parish minister of
Mochrum and latterly as a pulpit supply man and author of guidebooks,
trying to open Whithorn up to those of us who prefer shanks's pony to
sitting in tin boxes.
''Walking and cycling on quiet roads, farm tracks and coastal paths
can be a deeply healing and enjoyable experience,'' he beams over a pint
of 80 shilling in the Steam Packet Hotel on the Isle of Whithorn.
The Whithorn Pilgrim Way will eventually run down the western side of
the triangular peninsula - from Glenluce Abbey to Whithorn, the
so-called ''cradle of Scottish Christianity''. It will thread its way
north again to Wigtown and the Southern Upland Way.
Patterson first dreamt of a long-distance walk for latter-day pilgrims
in 1987, when the Church of Scotland urged presbyteries to think up
job-creation projects. Part of the route was eventually waymarked in
1993, the same year in which Patterson received an encouraging letter
from the Pope.
In 1997, the minister hopes to pull off a publicity coup for the Way
to Whithorn. That year marks the 1400th anniversary of the death of St
Columba of Iona, and the 1600th anniversary of the landing of St Ninian
at Whithorn.
A mass pilgrimage to Whithorn is a possibility, but Patterson is
looking for plenty spondulicks under the European Objective scheme for
hard-up rural areas, along with cash from the Millennium Fund.
''The Whithorn Trust, and whatever form of local government evolves
out of the reorganisation process, could liaise with Canterbury, Rome,
Iona and the Isle of Man to facilitate the celebrations of 1997,''
Patterson told me.
He knows what he is talking about. Last year he puttered along the
Celtic fringe on a motorbike whose engine was cannibalised from a
lawnmower. He took in Ireland, Cornwall, Britanny and Compostela.
Now that he is back, he points out that European money has helped to
construct thousands of miles of footpaths in Germany, France and Spain.
Why not Whithorn, he asks? It has the largest rural unemployment rate in
Scotland.
For those wary of walking through Scottish smir on a dankish day,
Patterson offers: ''The sabre-toothed midge of the Highland glens is
unknown in the Machars of Galloway.''
Billy Marshall occupies as prominent a place on the Gallovidian
pantheon as Ninian. At Marshall's funeral, the November wind mottled the
weatherbeaten mourners and whistled through dykes sabotaged 60 years
beforehand by the man in the coffin.
The Earl of Selkirk is said to have been chief mourner of ''the king
of the Galloway gypsies''. They say he had his senses about him to his
final hour, and had been walking the hills the day before his death,
despite his love of whisky.
''Billy, ye should watch how you treat that stuff. It's been the ruin
of many a fine man,'' a well-wisher had told Marshall on his last
Hogmanay.
''It maun be damned slow, then. For I ha'e drunk it for a hunner
years, an' I'm livin' yet,'' was the rejoinder.
A year later, Billy Marshall's headstone in St Cuthbert's churchyard
near Kirkcudbright would read:
The Remains of WILLIAM MARSHALL Tinker, who died
28th November 1792 at the advanced aged of 120 years
Some say Marshall was the last of the Pictish kings. Records show that
he fought at the Battle of the Boyne, and that he was married 17 times,
famously to Flora Maxwell, the prototype of Sir Walter Scott's Meg
Merrilees.
Legend has it that Marshall ruled the whole of Galloway, ''from the
braes of Glenapp to the brig-en' of Dumfries''. He was as happy
waylaying travellers as he was sitting smoking, drinking and cracking
with the infamous Dutch smuggler, Captain Yawkins.
They would sit for hours in Dirk Hatteraick's cave (Scott used Yawkins
as the prototype of Matteraick, another character of Guy Mannering).
When Marshall was not breaking the law, he would be crafting spoons
and other trinkets, some of which are on display at Kirkcudbright
museum. (While you are in Kirkcudbright, you should visit Broughton
House - once the home of the artist Edward Hornel, now the location of
the largest private collection of Burnsiana).
The coast east of Kirkcudbright is notched with caves. Unfortunately,
a good slice of the coastline here is off-limits, thanks to the presence
of the MoD base at Dundrennan. Ironically, Port Mary stands on the
fringe of the danger zone; for the romantics, it was here that Mary
Queen of Scots spent her last night on Scottish soil before sailing into
exile.
One man who knows the treacherous tides of the Solway is 79-year-old
Eddie Parker, who has leased a little island off this coast for 35
years. Heston, which Samuel Rutherford Crockett enlarged into Rathan in
his book The Raiders, is accessible by foot during low tide.
Eddie, the lighthouse-keeper, keeps salmon nets on the islet, so he is
often to be seen making his way over the sands on foot, on tractor or on
a boat. One of the chaps who kept the lighthouse when Eddie was a boy
earned #25 for his troubles. He paid #24 rent for the island and
supplemented the #1 disposable income by keeping sheep.
There are still sheep. Every spring there is a sight to behold: the
procession of the island's resident lambs as they head to the market
over the Solway. Sue Gilroy of Auchencairn keeps the lambs. She also
keeps wild boar on the mainland.
Yes, Galloway does have its eccentricities. Take the Scottish
alternative games at Parton, on the road to Dalry, whose events include
snail-racing and the world gird 'n' cleek championships.
Then there are the world flounder-tramping championships at Palnackie,
on the Urr estuary. Scaremongering about radioactive mud fails to deter
hundreds of participants homing in on the coastal village on the
appointed day every year.
Sandyhills Bay on the true Riviera stretch of the Colvend coast,
sports one of Scotland's top beaches, and is highly recommended. With
the para-Wagnerian backdrop of Galloway peaks and forests, the sweeping
bay and its rocky headlands form one of the most magnificently
picturesque scenes west of Sorrento.
Enter Frank Gourlay, regional councillor, chairman of the steering
group for the new area tourist board, and proprietor of award-winning
chalet complexes at Sandyhills and Kippford.
''Galloway gives people a sense of getting away from it all: I know it
sounds corny and brochure-speak, but it really is Scotland in miniature.
Years and years ago I took my architect all over Galloway and he told
me: 'It's got a little bit of everything.'
''It is good and green and, although more middle-aged people come here
than young people, it is versatile. Nobody ever mentions that Dumfries
and Galloway is the first Scottish region not to pump raw sewage into
the sea.''
And finally to the Rhinns of Galloway, that elongated chunk of land
west of Stranraer, which would have been an island but for the isthmus
between Loch Ryan and Luce Bay.
When I visited the Rhinns I resolved to move there as soon as I had
the right six numbers on Saturday night. But for the odd telephone line,
it is a peninsula, unspoilt in the pre-brochure sense of the word; a
peninsula where two cars constitute a traffic jam.
Portpatrick, that characterful little yachting village, is worth
pottering around, and most folk drive south to Drummore and thence to
the Mull of Galloway, Scotland's Land's End. For me, though, the
northern route to Corsewall Point, where Robert Louis Stevenson's
grandfather built a lighthouse, gladdens the heart that wee bit more.
IT must be said that I caught Scotland's surprising south-west on a
good day, full of sunshine and colour. That morning, however, the sun
had been slow in waking. Haar had clung to the fields and the gnarled
headland, and the fog-horn of one of the ferries to Northern Ireland had
dispelled any hopes of our picking out the Irish coast way out west.
The secluded Knocknassie Hotel was shut, too - which was a pity, since
I had gone there to see some of the fittings. The hotel managed to
procure the shower-room, admiral's cloakrooms and other pieces of the
Ark Royal, scrapped at Cairnryan after a distinguished career.
As the drone of another horn drowned out the tranquillising tunes of
the seagulls, I spared a thought for the 133 ill-fated passengers of the
Princess Victoria, which had sunk in the loch during a ferocious storm
en route to Larne in 1953.
If the fog is not on your side, maybe it is time to drive down to the
Mull, which shares a latitude with Hartlepool, but lacks the kudos of
Scotland's other pole, John o' Groats. The Mull has seen its tragedies -
and not just shipwrecks.
According to an ancient ballad, a noted brewer by the name of Trost of
the Long Knife threw himself and his son off the cliffs there rather
than surrender his recipe to aggressive rivals.

Profile / City of Perth by Jack Webster
IN a festival of remembrance and colourful celebration, the Fair City
of Perth will today mark Victory in Europe with the biggest parade the
nation has seen outside London.
In the home of the Black Watch -- and rounding off this week of VE-Day
ceremonies -- the massed pipes and drums will summon war veterans from
all across the country to join in a commemoration which will reach a
fitting climax with the unveiling of a memorial to the famous 51st
Highland Division.
That life-size bronze of a Scottish soldier, receiving a posy from a
grateful Dutch girl, will not only pay due tribute to those men who
fought and died but will symbolise the part they played in the
liberation of that little girl's homeland in the Second World War.
During a day of mixed emotion, another nation's bravery will not be
forgotten. For it was here in Perthshire that men like General Sikorski
and the Polish Division prepared for the battlefields of Europe.
And it was to this same picturesque haven in the heart of Scotland
that their wounded were brought back -- a special corner of the town's
Wellshill Cemetery was dedicated to the many who died.
To a choral background this morning, local children will lay their
posies on more than 200 Polish war graves, watched over by people like
Janina Jarmulska, who took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, was cast
into a German prisoner-of-war camp and finally liberated, appropriately
by Polish troops, at the end of the war.
Since 1947 she and her husband Jan, a former Polish Army officer, have
lived in Perth, where they ran a market-garden business.
The fact that the reflective mood of Victory in Europe should be
expressed so tellingly in Perth gives hint of another victory which this
same city is achieving on its own behalf.
It is a measure of the general confidence of the place that this
initiative should have been taken by Provost Jean McCormack and her
council colleagues of Perth and Kinross District.
The past few years have seen one of those curious transformations
which can bring the spotlight on a community before there is time to
analyse what actually happened.
In that time, Perth has emerged from its traditional image of the
douce county town to become the flavour of the age among Scottish towns
and cities, dynamic and progressive. Is it all a coincidence? A
chemistry wrought by fate? Or the outcome of shrewd and deliberate
policy?
The deputy director of tourism, Patrick Laughlin, has an interesting
theory, pinpointing the origins to a study report of 1987-88 which
damned Perth with faint praise, describing it as a city of shabby
gentility.
''That got the collective dander up,'' Laughlin said. ''Around 1990 a
vast series of major projects came on stream -- shopping streets
pedestrianised, a new leisure centre, new ice-rink, new football stadium
for St Johnstone to match the best in the land.
''Everybody was sparked into action and a new civic pride arose. By
1991 an independent survey about the quality of life in this country
came up with the view that Perth was the best place in Britain to
live.''
By 1993 it was literally blossoming into further prominence as the
winner of the Britain in Bloom contest, also coming third in the
European version.
Inward investment began to flow and unemployment was below average.
Perth was already blessed with the fact that it was not only home to
whiskies like Bells, Dewar's and The Famous Grouse but was the world
headquarters of the huge General Accident insurance company.
One thing leads to another, with the highly prestigious Caithness
Glass adding its own sparkle to the local economy, to be followed by
perhaps the most sensational business story of them all.
When a local woman Ann Gloag started a small bus company with her
brother she could hardly have guessed that, within a few years, it would
grow into a world-wide operation.
Today the Stagecoach bus company operates as far afield as Hong Kong,
New Zealand and Kenya, runs 7000 vehicles, employs 22,000 people and has
a turnover of more than #400m.
Ann Gloag, who has become Scotland's richest woman in the process,
said yesterday: ''Perth is an ideal place to live, so well placed
geographically. It is the headquarters of our company -- and this is
where it will stay.''
As you saunter by the banks of the Tay, Scotland's longest river,
yielding salmon and pearls and carrying more water than the Thames and
Severn combined, it would be hard to disagree with Ann Gloag's idyllic
picture.
In the heart of the town you come upon the impressive kirk of St
John's, with its cathedral-like rafters which once shook to that
historic sermon of John Knox, delivered this very week of 1559, which is
widely credited with having sparked the Reformation.
When a priest followed Knox's tirade against idolatry by saying Mass
at the altar, he was challenged by a boy whose ear he is said to have
clipped. The crowd was so incensed that rioting broke out.
The present incumbent and well-known Scottish author, the Rev David
Ogston, puts history aside and confirms the new confidence he has seen
developing in Perth.
''It faced a choice between change and the genteel resignation of
fading into a nonentity of a place,'' is how he puts it. ''Thankfully,
successive councils and provosts showed initiative, bravado, imagination
and energy and took up the attitude of 'Let's do it!' Now there is a new
feeling of self-awareness and a general buoyancy.''
Ogston cites the successful Perth Festival of the Arts and the
Fergusson Gallery conversion as cultural events which underpin the
growing confidence.
Outby, the air is beginning to thicken with political talk. For it is
here in 12 days that local people will vote in the by-election created
by the death of the inimitable Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
Ogston, who conducted the former MP's funeral service at St John's,
smiles warmly at the memory of the flamboyant Sir Nicky and says: ''For
years I had written angry letters saying how I disagreed with him. But
the more you disagreed with him the more he liked you. And he ended up
by designing me the most splendid ministerial robes. That was Nicky!''
The electorate seems unlikely to transfer such warm sentiments to his
Conservative successor, John Godfrey, who is widely expected to lose out
to the Scottish Nationalists.
Labour leader Tony Blair was in town this week but the general feeling
is that the Nationalists can only lose it. Their candidate, Roseanna
Cunningham, would no doubt fare even better if shorn of her republican
sympathies, since Perth folk value their neighbourhood link with the
Queen Mother, whose family home was at Glamis.
Politics apart, you wander through the neat streets of this prosperous
town and absorb more than a hint of what is currently called the
feel-good factor. Alongside the modern temples of consumer worship there
are, happily, still shops which look as if they have served the
community for a long time and with quality and service.
Sadly, there is one such shop displaying a notice that it will close
for good today. It is the old Meal Shop in King Edward Street, still
with its wooden walls from the turn of the century and the bins from
which the oatmeal and related commodities were dispensed to the people
of Perth.
In more modern times it has been a food shop for pets as well as their
owners, but still with its fine old smell of the land. Alex Sneddon has
lived comfortably from his Meal Shop for the past 25 years but the lease
is running out and he retires tonight.
It has long been Salvation Army property and, whatever the future
plans, it seems that Perth is losing a valuable link with its own
history.
So you put the past aside and walk towards the North Inch, taking in
the announcement of another farewell. Those brilliant satirical
entertainers, the Aberdeen-based Scotland The What?, reached Perth in
their final tour this week and give a last performance tonight.
Everything is now geared for today's VE parade -- and the Royal George
Hotel is offering a special ''high tea'' for the occasion, a welcome
reassurance that Scotland can still produce its own fare as an
alternative to stir-fries and tandooris.
So you reach the North Inch -- and the memorial to the 51st, neatly
landscaped by the river and just a short distance from the main road
leading on to the old bridge over the Tay.
Provost Jean McCormack explains how it all came about: ''Over six
months ago I was invited to Holland with a pilgrimage of veterans for
the unveiling of a memorial to the 51st Division. It struck me that we
should have something similar and, when I came back, I put the
suggestion to Perth and Kinross District Council. The members agreed
that we should finance such a memorial.''
With the co-operation of people like General Sir Derek Lang and
Brigadier Melville Jameson, Commander of the 51st Brigade, Provost
McCormack chaired a committee which focused its attention on the Victory
in Europe anniversary.
Edinburgh-based sculptor Alan Herriot was commissioned to create the
life-size bronze and the site was chosen on the edge of that picturesque
sweep by the River Tay.
Meanwhile, in the local election for the new unitary authority, the
Conservative Provost McCormack lost her seat to the now-ruling
Nationalists. But she remains as provost till next year and will take
her place at today's march past and drumhead service.
She will be joined by civic heads from other parts of the old Highland
Division area, like Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness -- and by their
counterparts from Holland and France.
For many, there will be a special poignancy in the presence of the
Mayor of St Valery. For it was at that historic town in 1940 that so
many of our Highland soldiers found themselves trapped by the German
troops, coming face to face with Rommel himself.
They were marched off to prison camps throughout Germany, to serve the
next five years in captivity. Their survival from that ordeal, mixed
with memories of colleagues who did not come back, will be uppermost in
the minds of so many old soldiers this afternoon -- as they cast their
gaze upon that bronze memorial by the banks of the silvery Tay.

Reported birds of prey killings have doubled in recent years prompting
a bid to snare offenders and save our wildlife as Elizabeth Buie reports
IN the Highland Clearances, according to contemporary accounts, there
were as many as three pairs of golden eagles in a glen. People would
climb to the eyries and take rabbits out to feed themselves.
At the last count, in 1992, there were only 425 pairs of golden eagles
in Scotland, and of these, very few in Southern Scotland. There should
be far more of them. That there are not is in large part due to man's
persecution of these birds.
Today, for the first time, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds, has published statistics on illegal persecution of birds of prey
in Scotland. The report analyses 170 reported incidents, ranging from
nest destruction, shooting, poisoning, and trap baiting.
Hen harriers, buzzards and peregrines are the species most frequently
persecuted, but golden eagles and goshawks are also affected. Incidents
were reported throughout mainland Scotland, apart from the far North and
West where land is less likely to be keepered. The highest incidence was
in the Borders, eastern parts of the country, and the Monadhliath
Mountains, where most grouse moors are to be found.
Only two incidents, both from 1993, however, led to prosecution in
1994. Both were of gamekeepers and both resulted in guilty verdicts. One
1994 poisoning incident may result in court proceedings.
Such offences, by their very nature, take place in remote areas
without witnesses. The problem facing the RSPB, police, or agriculture
and fisheries officials involved in investigations, is whether the 170
reported incidents are the tip of a huge iceberg, or an accurate
representation of illegal activity. The former is more likely to be the
case.
Now, with reported incidents of the destruction of birds twice as high
as five years ago, the RSPB is left wondering whether the apparent
increase is actual, or simply a reflection of greater public awareness
and better reporting.
What does hearten conservationists is the evidence that poisoning has
declined considerably in recent years.
David Dick, the RSPB's investigations officer in Scotland, attributes
this to the Government's high-profile anti-poisoning publicity campaign,
and a growing social rejection of the practice.
''People feel embarrassed in front of their children, colleagues and
neighbours if they are involved in poisoning. This is partly because
poisoning has had such bad effects on non-target species -- such as
people's cats and dogs in some areas,'' he said.
''But every time a golden eagle has been killed, it has had a dripping
tap effect. It is such an awful thing to do,'' Dick said.
In the majority of reported shooting or baiting incidents, informants
gave the name of the suspected perpetrator -- 86 of the alleged
offenders were gamekeepers, six were members of shooting syndicates, and
four were pigeon-fanciers. The most common methods of persecution were
nest destruction -- either the removal of eggs or killing the young,
and/or the physical removal of the nest -- shooting, the use of spring
traps (on poles or on the ground with a bait) and the use of cage traps
with either live or dead bait.
Hen harriers, conspicuous and found close to grouse moors, are the
most commonly persecuted species. They make easy targets during the
nesting season when they are unwilling to leave their young.
Buzzards, despite being the second most persecuted species last year,
are showing signs of re-expansion to their former range. Peregrines,
too, are recovering from their previous decline and are now being
reported in places where they had not been seen in 100 years.
The RSPB is careful not to be too accusatory, but clearly feels that
landowning interests concerned about the uncertain economics of grouse
moor management are behind much of the illegal persecution.
To date, not enough is known about the exact interaction between
predators and their prey, and without more research it will be difficult
for either side to win the argument convincingly. One study, being
carried out by the RSPB, the Game Conservancy Council, and the Institute
of Terrestrial Ecology, is under way at Langholm, on the Duke of
Buccleuch's estates. The research will continue for five years, and its
participants refuse even to hint about initial findings.
In simplistic terms, conservationist organisations such as the RSPB
argue that a healthy grouse moor will provide a healthy population of
prey which in turn will support a higher level of predators. The
landowners' representative organisation, the Scottish Landowners'
Federation, feels that if the grouse population reaches a particularly
low level, recovery will be virtually impossible in the face of what it
calls ''uncontrolled predation'' as the levels of some species grow.
The SLF is unequivocal in condemning illegal killing, particularly
through poisoning. Nevertheless, as its director Simon Fraser said, it
feels the time has come to seek changes in the Wildlife and Countryside
Act, which it sees as being implemented too rigidly.
''We just feel it is time to start thinking about what to do when we
have got that kind of situation (uncontrolled predation in areas of low
levels of grouse). Until recently no-one was willing to talk about the
problem, partly because of the illegal practices,'' Fraser said.
Two weeks ago, however, the possibility of introducing a limited
licensing system permitting authorised shooting of Schedule One
protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act was raised at a
meeting held under the auspices of the Department of Environment. It
seems likely that a working party will be set up to look at that and
other raptor issues, although landowners accept that it will be some
time before a solution is found to such a difficult question.
For the RSPB, senior spokesman David Minns said: ''It is disappointing
that people are proposing to reduce the level of legal protection for
some of our most special birds. It is really rather extraordinary that
this should be happening in the 1990s when, if anything, protection is
steadily increasing, as in the EU's Habitats Directive which safeguards
most important areas.
''It would be really rather strange for us if at the same time as
trying to do that we were also trying to reduce the legal protection of
some of our most special species.''
If anything, the RSPB would like to see the Wildlife and Countryside
Act strengthened, providing power to arrest and, preferably, jail,
anyone caught shooting a golden eagle -- as can now happen to anyone
caught shooting a deer on an estate. Nevertheless, fines for persecution
of birds of prey can reach as high as #5000.
Ultimately, public awareness and public condemnation are the
conservationists' strongest weapons.
''I am pleased that when members of the public see a dead bird of prey
they realise that all may not be well and that the bird has not died of
a heart attack. It is a sad thing, but it helps in the long run that
people are less innocent about what they see in the countryside, and
that their knowledge of the countryside has increased greatly,'' Dick
said.

The Dead Sea may be the lowest place on Earth, but Kirsty Scott finds
Israel and Jordan very much alive to its tourist-pulling potential
* In Jordan investors are looking to build a miniature Disney theme
park in a proposed recreation zone on the shores of the Dead Sea.
Mohammed Abdel-Kader, head of development projects in the state-run
Jordan Valley Authority, said 110 local and foreign companies have
proposed projects in the zone. Among them is a ''Disneyland-style
area''. He said some investors were in contact with the Disney
Corporation in the United States, but declined to elaborate. The other
proposals from firms in the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Jordan involve direct investment in
commercial ventures within the zone, with the Jordanian Government
providing infrastructure services.
The Dead Sea, at 400m (1312ft) below sea level, is the lowest point on
the earth's surface. It is shared by Jordan and Israel, which signed a
peace treaty in October. Development of the Jordan Rift Valley, which
encompasses the Dead Sea and runs along the border of the two countries,
is the centrepiece of Jordanian-Israeli economic co-operation.
The two countries have drawn up a massive development programme for
the valley under American auspices. On the western shore of the Dead
Sea, Israel is planning to build what it calls a ''Lowest Place on Earth
Park''. That facility will include nature reserves, health clinics, a
mineral park, hotels and other related tourism infrastructure, and will
be linked across the Dead Sea with the Jordanian side.
Hundreds of thousands of tourists flock to biblical and archaeological
sites in Jordan and Israel every year, and many go to the Dead Sea to
benefit from the therapeutic powers of its mud and waters. The proposed
recreational area will also have a health spa for skin diseases and a
cable-car link between the Dead Sea and the (hot) springs at Ma'in. The
Ma'in spa, about 60km (36 miles) south-west of Amman, offers specialised
treatment for skin diseases. It is located on the side of a high hill
overlooking the Dead Sea.
Israel and Jordan have also agreed to launch joint tourism projects
and expand an airport at Aqaba, 350km (210 miles) south of Amman, to
serve an expected increase in visitors to both countries.
BELGIAN airline Sabena is continuing its campaign to woo more Scottish
travellers. Late last month it launched new Business Bonus fares from
Glasgow and Edinburgh to more than 30 destinations beyond Brussels, with
savings of up to 36% on normal full business-class fares.
The initiative is the third unveiled by Sabena in recent weeks. The
first was the launch of the Business Budget fares from Glasgow and
Edinburgh which knocked #53 off the regular rates. The second step was
to increase flights between Brussels and Glasgow and Edinburgh and the
start of dedicated, non-stop services twice a day on weekdays.
Speaking in Glasgow recently, Sabena's general manager for the UK and
Ireland, Etienne de Nil, said they were committed to their campaign to
try to win more traffic from Scotland. ''The improved schedules between
Brussels and Scotland we hope will also bring increased interest and
investment from the Continent to Scotland,'' he said. ''We already bring
in many hundreds of tourists, particularly from Italy and Germany, and,
of course, Belgium.''
* IN Hong Kong, the Hilton Hotel, which opened during the
water-rationed 1960s and watched the colony transformed into an economic
powerhouse, closed on May 1 -- a victim of the city's prosperity.
The hotel's prime location among the headquarters of the colony's
three note-printing banks, the Bank of China, the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank, and the Standard Chartered Bank, was considered too valuable to
waste, even on a luxury hotel.
Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, will tear down the 26-storey
building and put up a more profitable office skyscraper. Tenants in the
colony, which will be handed back to China in 1997, pay some of the
highest rents in the world to have an office on the edge of huge
potential markets in China and the rest of fast-growing Asia.
''When the hotel opened it was the centre of social activity on Hong
Kong island,'' said Phillipa Yule, public relations manager for Hilton
International. At the time Hong Kong was struggling with a severe water
shortage -- guests had to wash in a bucket -- and offered few venues for
socialites to gather.
Hilton had 20 years to run on its Hong Kong contract. Li paid Hilton
#84m to tear up its contract two years after the hotel had a #10m
facelift.
* A LAS VEGAS company has opened the first gambling casino on a sleepy
island in the Northern Marianas, best known as the launching spot for
the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in 1945.
The Mayor of Tinian, Herman Manglona, said he expected the casino,
opened over the weekend, to bring prosperity to the island, adding that
people were willing to pay the price that goes with an economy spurred
by gambling.
''For every development you have to pay a certain price,'' the mayor
said. ''But if you weigh the negative impact versus the good impact, I
believe that with this casino on Tinian, we are able to upgrade our
living standards.''
The atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 were
dropped by US planes based on Tinian, 2400km (1500 miles) east of
Manila. The island municipality projects $12m in revenue each year from
the casino, operated by the Lone Star Casino Corporation of Nevada.
Lone Star's primary target is the tourist market, said Roger Cope,
Lone Star president and chief operating officer.
The casino, in a two-storey, temporary building in San Jose Village,
has 65 slot machines and 14 crap, baccarat, roulette, mini-baccarat, and
blackjack tables.
But Tinian has only 40 hotel rooms and its limited infrastructure is a
problem for handling large numbers of tourists. Lone Star plan to solve
that by leasing three 30-seat Shorts-360 aircraft to transport gamblers
on day trips from Guam and Saipan, islands popular with Japanese
tourists.
Pacific Island Aviation will operate four other 30-seat planes to
Tinian, Lone Star executives said. Tinian is the only island in the
Northern Marianas where casinos are allowed. Gambling has long been
debated in the islands but efforts to set up casinos in the 1970s were
overturned by a referendum backed by the Roman Catholic Church.
Tinian, though scenic, cannot compete with Saipan and Rota in natural
beauty. The 2000 residents approved casinos in a 1990 vote to boost
tourism.

EUROVISION'S ghastliest manifestation will tonight be brought back to
life on the TV screens of an unsuspecting nation. More awful than Abba
singing Waterloo! Eeek! More horrific than Cliff Richard doing the
drowning haddock dance to the strains of Congratulations! Boak!
It's the Brotherhood Of Man! Arrggh! Re-running the full-frontal
assault on taste and decency that was Save All Your Kisses For Me!
Yecccch . . .
But fear not, it's not the real Brotherhood Of Man, and it's all in a
good cause. A pretend Brotherhood Of Man has been assembled to appear on
BBC1's National Lottery Draw programme at 7.50pm, utilising two of the
cast from Music Theatre Lab's Marry Me A Little and two of the cast from
Theatre of the Golden Age's off-Broadway musical, Closer Than Ever.
Both productions are on view in Glasgow's West End this weekend, at
the Cottier Theatre, the lively venue which is barely a mile from the
site of this week's live National Lottery draw, Kelvingrove Art Gallery.
And as the self-same Cottier has just been granted #9500 from lottery
funds for its new lighting rig, who better to accept the cheque on
Eurofission kristallnacht than some of the Cottier's performers singing
Save All Your Scratchcards For Us?
But hey, don't stay in for the TV lottery draw. Instead, video it and
get down to the Cottier at 7.30pm for Opera On A Shoestring's version of
La Traviata. And then hang about in the Cottier's funky bar until 11pm
when it's time for Music Theatre Lab's concluding performance of Marry
Me A Little.
And if you're wondering what to do at 8pm tomorrow, direct your feet
to the Cottier again for Theatre of the Golden Age's opening
performance. OK?
But what else will you be able to see tonight? Mary-Chapin Carpenter
at the Royal Concert Hall, but only if you can beg, borrow, or steal a
ticket. Ditto her show there tomorrow.
Or you might care to rhumba and cha-cha-cha your way to the Shed in
Clydebrae Street for an evening of ballroom flamboyance with sequinned
lovelies Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather, global monarchs of the
Latin dance scene.
Whatever else you might be planning to do tomorrow, forget about going
to see Apache Indian at the Plaza. Cancelled. Try a 12.30pm lunchtime
classical concert instead, featuring the RSNO Allender Ensemble. Where?

not out of a chocolate box, suggests Elizabeth Clark
OPERA which is precise, positive, accessible, entertaining and direct
-- just a few of the adjectives to be found in the mission statement of
Crystal Clear Opera, who visit Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on Wednesday
with their touring production of Peter Brook's stage spectacular The
Tragedy of Carmen.
Under the artistic direction of Martin McEvoy, Crystal Clear has built
up a reputation as one of the finest tourist companies in the country.
McEvoy, a former professional singer, found himself at a bit of a
crossroads on the dissolution of the new Sadler's Wells Opera.
As a result, he set to work establishing a production company
initially working in theatre. Having had a taste of promoting the arts,
McEvoy made the decision to return to his first love of opera.
''I realised that opera was becoming more and more popular, and as a
result lots of people were starting up small companies. Although their
hearts were in the right place, they were producing many bad
performances. There is nothing worse than bad opera.''
McEvoy's passion and commitment in achieving his ambition cannot be
understated. ''I eventually plucked up the courage to tell my wife that
I'd remortgaged the house, and set off on a debut tour.'' The tour
proved to be most successful and the rest, as they say, is history.
On their new production of The Tragedy of Carmen, McEvoy explained the
appeal of this particular piece. ''I wanted to say something new. It's
not what I'd call a chocolate box opera, all thrills and sweetness --
it's earthy and to the point. After all, Carmen herself was a gypsy, a
prostitute, and a witch. Tragedy crystalises the story to bring out the
true drama of the piece.''
The Tragedy of Carmen falls under the keen eye of dynamic young
director Karen Howard. A staff producer with Scottish Opera, Howard
realised that the Crystal Clear experience was an opportunity not to be
missed.
''I was attracted by the intimate nature of their environment -- it's
nearer to studio opera really. It's not a stepping stone to full-scale
opera but rather something quite different, with everyone working
towards an ultimate aim of accessibility.''
Howard's approach to The Tragedy of Carmen is a fresh one. ''Not
having seen Peter Brook's adaptation live, I came to the score with no
comparisons, so I can only hope to put across the truth, the spectacle,
and of course the original intentions of the composer.''
To set the record straight, what is the difference between this Carmen
and Bizet's original? ''The Tragedy of Carmen takes out the unnecessary
glitz and chorus, preferring to concentrate on the strong, stark story
which depicts the tragedy of everyone in the plot.
The characters can be exposed in a way not possible in full-scale
opera. I actually prefer this version. Saying that, if someone asked me
to do a Carmen then I'm hardly going to turn it down. I'll be all the
better prepared now, having done the groundwork with Tragedy.''
Concentrating heavily on Merimee's original novella, and retaining
much of Bizet's original score, this red-blooded adaptation focuses on
the personal plights and sexual desires of the central characters.
Embracing the full range of human emotions from love and hate, passion
and conflict, madness and insolence, the drama climaxes with the
inevitable murder of Carmen.
Sung in English with modern vocabulary by some of this country's
finest soloists, Crystal Clear's The Tragedy of Carmen is capable of
making a tremendous theatrical impact. Accompanied by their committed
orchestra, musical standards are maintained at a very high level, and
though perhaps lacking in numbers with an orchestra of only 13, they are
never found to be lacking in passion.
Artistic director McEvoy is proud of his company's achievements.
''Arts Council funding provides only #15,000 a year. We're a commercial
company that happens to put on opera. It just so happens that we work
very hard and have a huge turnover -- over 110 performances this year.
It's a case of have opera, will travel.''
Crystal Clear travels to Edinburgh's Festival Theatre with The Tragedy
of Carmen next Wednesday, 7.15pm.

THE crucial thing is that everyone was talking about it at the end. I
mean really debating it. And the fact the discussion rages on -- and
will rage on in bars and cars after every performance of the Royal
Lyceum's three-week run -- means that, regardless of the playwright's
intentions, there's no point in labelling Oleanna as propaganda.
Everyone who sees it will watch with a critical eye. No-one is going to
be duped.
In case you've been asleep for the past three years, David Mamet's
play is about a female student and her male professor -- he
intellectually and physically overbearing; she, vulnerable and
frustrated, is over-zealous to cry rape.
Sorry. Perhaps it's not zeal. Perhaps she does have genuine reason to
believe that a sympathetic touch here and a smutty story there really do
constitute sexual violation. Perhaps.
Because one of the weaknesses of Mamet's play, brilliantly constructed
though its dialogue and its turn-arounds are, is that the student's side
of the argument is too obviously the least convincing. Sure, Mamet has a
fair bash at letting her have her say (and in Kenny Ireland's compelling
production, Fiona Bell is a tough adversary for Tom Mannion), but the
odds are stacked against her.
But worse than that, just as Mamet's argument is that the student is
at fault for representing a codified mindset of ''political
correctness'' instead of her real experience, so Mamet is at fault for
trying to pass off a specific situation as a universal experience. Just
as all men are not rapists, the student is not all women.
But to misquote the professor, ''That's Mamet's job, to provoke us.''
And here I am debating it. Like breakfasting theatregoers all over
Lyceum-land.

MAYFEST'S answer to Glyndebourne, eh? Bet they don't get to wander
into the new Glyndebourne opera house slugging pints of lager? Scottish
Opera went into the vernacular last night to launch its new season.
Instead of the formal press conference we had bleeding chunks,
introduced by Blythe Duff, and delivered to a crowd of 2000 from an
amplified Scottish Opera orchestra, chorus and soloists from the coming
season.
And, in the spirit of the occasion, of Mayfest, and of the
extraordinary Harland and Wolff Shed -- last night resonating like an
industrial cathedral -- we had them all in plain clothes. No tuxedos, no
costumes . . . looked natural, looked good. And music director Richard
Armstrong got to wear his shirt of many colours, upstaging the lot of
them.
So what are we going to get next season? Seven productions -- rather
meagre fare, what? Five new productions, and two of these first
performances in the company. Dvorak's comic opera, The Jacobin, which
will open during the Edinburgh Festival, is an unknown quantity, but to
judge from the extracts last night, looks very promising indeed.
A lush orchestral opening launched into a typically Slavonic chorus
(bit of sight reading going on here?). Then the love duet, with Richard
Coxon and Claire Rutter, a stormer of a piece that opens with pastoral
innocence and builds to an ardent bit of Romanticism.
Offenbach's La Belle Helene (extracts from Anne Howells and Coxon) is
going to be a fine piece of froth. Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel will
charm them into the theatre. Don Giovanni returns (Lisa Milne and
Stephen Gadd sang the extracts) with an interesting debut -- artist
Peter Howson dips his toe into operatic waters to design the Mozart
masterpiece. And Gluck's Alceste makes a welcome appearance, in
collaboration with Opera de Nice. Isabelle Vernet sang stunningly last
night.
Nuria Espert's production of La Traviata will be revived, but the
heavy-duty romanticism is reserved for Puccini's Turandot -- the Welsh
National Opera production, from which tenor Deng last night sang (rather
heavily) Nessun Dorma. More of all this anon, no doubt.

TOM RUSSELL is a gift to a reviewer. Just when you're wondering how
you're going to describe that voice this time, he announces the ''Johnny
Cash after three thousand rough nights version'' of an old favourite.
Such self-effacement is admirable but there's more music, more
elasticity in his voice than that.
Then there's the songs. Thirty years of writing have produced an
embarrassment of riches that shows no signs of drying up. The tried and
trusted short-stories-with-chord-changes, Angel of Lyons and Evangeline
Hotel, were followed by the brand new Out to California.
This declaration that gone doesn't equal forgotten, sung to a train
rhythm of considerable momentum, had echoes of Russell's mentor, Merle
Haggard, to whom rich tribute was paid later with the sincere, hurting
Tulare Dust/Tearing the Labour Camps Down medley. It was also one of
many opportunities for Russell's sidekick, guitarist Andrew Hardin, to
rip into the tune with a zest and concision that left many a head
shaking in awe.
Another new song, What Do You Want From Me?, showed a wry sense of
humour with a brilliantly timed pay off begging his partner not to force
a choice ''between this guitar and you'' before Hardin stepped forward
for a blistering sortie into Ernest Tubbs's Driving Nails Into My
Coffin.
And the hits just kept on coming. At least they would be hits if there
was any justice. But, with his assertion that Oklahoma and California
produce the best country music and his New York realism, Russell remains
adrift from the mainstream, a well-kept secret but one well worth
knowing.

TEEN ROCK ain't what it used to be. There are no screaming girls and
only two stage diving boys among Shed Seven's youthful audience at a
packed Garage. In fact, the crowd is too knowing, too cool, and
ultimately too restrained to make the most of their heroes' post-Top of
the Pops euphoria.
From eight million viewers one night to The Garage the next may make
for a certain anti-climax, but the crowd seem merely to have modest
expectations of mediocre idols.
The band's musical immaturity lessens the impact of their occasionally
bright pop moments, as the undistinguished song-writing blends one song
of designer 90s pop into another, the influences of the Smiths and the
Jam, and the general English pop lineage never far from the surface.
Lyrical cliche means the outcome is something resembling Oasis without
songs, the Stone Roses without a guitar hero, and the Smiths without a
wordsmith, redeemed only by a kind of infectious, youth club made
good-type enthusiasm. Rick Witter is an uninspiring frontman, while the
songs from their new album, perhaps hindered by their unfamiliarity,
gave little indication of progress from those on Change Giver.
However, just as Shed Seven seemed confined to the status of
also-rans, they pulled out all their best shots at the end of the show,
their current single Where Have You Been Tonight, with its big
chant-along chorus, and the encores of Dirty Soul, Ocean Pie and Dolphin
hinted at something greater, a potential largely missing in the insipid
competence of that which had proceeded it.
''Oo-ah, Shed Sev-en'' chanted the audience. Shed Seven, we mumbled
unconvinced.

Conrad Wilson visits a small Italian opera house whose guidebook seems
to say, 'Whaur's your Scala noo?'
PEOPLE speeding from Milan to Bologna on Italy's smooth new Pendolino
train are usually aware of Piacenza, if at all, as a passing blur. Who
would want to stop there? Dickens deemed it ''stern'' and Jonathan
Keates, in a more recent book of Italian journeys, called it one of the
most ''insidiously creepy'' places he had ever set foot in.
It does, indeed, have a quietly sinister air, the sombre, narrow
streets of the old town possessing many a hidden door way in which,
stiletto in hand, a local Sparafucile could lurk. Yet its quietness is
one of its pleasures. Saved from tourists and sightseers, its 102,000
inhabitants can be simply themselves. Its opera house presents singers
from Milan at considerably less than Scala prices. Its restaurants serve
robust local dishes. Its fizzy red wine from the nearby vineyards of
Oltrepo Pavese is poured into white china hand-bowls, in which you can
swirl it and examine it before drinking it. A town of character, in
fact, and reachable in 45 minutes by the slow train from Milan.
Most people who have the good luck to discover Piacenza usually do so
through private contacts -- an aspect, no doubt, of its air of secrecy.
Yet it has a fine history, a medieval town centre, an idiosyncratic
mixture of buildings, and a handsome square with a pair of prancing
seventeenth-century equestrian statues (one of them recently removed for
what appears to be long-term renovation). Poised at the end of the Via
Emilia, it is one of the long-established stopping points on the pilgrim
route to Rome. I am not sure why I like it so much, but one reason is
that I have friends there who are proud of it, who have shown me round,
and who know how to communicate their enthusiasm.
Another reason is that I like small opera houses, and Piacenza's
Teatro Municipale, with a mere thousand seats, is a nice size. Its
unromantic name -- another quiet Piacenza deception -- may seem to
promise nothing much, but in fact, with its horseshoe auditorium, and
its five tiers of pillared boxes, it looks like a miniature Scala.
Indeed, when I was there in January, the exquisite Daniela Dessi was
singing Alice in Verdi's Falstaff just before appearing in the same role
at the Scala itself. Renato Bruson, another Scala stalwart, sang the
title role. With only four or five productions per season, interwoven
with concerts and plays, it's all a bit reminiscent of Scottish Opera in
its early days, when every performance was a triumph of local
achievement, yet standards were of international calibre.
In the past, many operas reached Piacenza within a year or so of their
premieres elsewhere in Italy, and the theatre proudly lists them --
Bellini's Norma, Donizetti's Elisir d'Amore, Mascagni's Cavalleria
Rusticana, Verdi's Otello -- in its little guidebook, as if to say
''Whaur's your Scala or San Carlo noo?'' Puccini's Manon Lescaut and La
Boheme travelled even quicker. To have lived in Piacenza between 1818,
when Rossini's Barber of Seville was staged there, and 1900, when Tosca
arrived within months of its premiere in Rome, would have been to be on
the main thoroughfare of new Italian opera.
Verdi himself was born only 20 miles away, in the village of Roncole,
near Parma. Luigi Illica, Puccini's best librettist, was a Piacentino,
as the inhabitants call themselves. Berlioz, with Benvenuto Cellini
already forming in his mind, passed through in 1832 -- though it was not
in Piacenza but in Florence that he morbidly followed a funeral
procession to the morgue and held the hand of the corpse, a young woman
who had died in childbirth.
Today, like many others in Italy, Piacenza's is an opera house content
to stage the standard repertoire. Falstaff this season came between
Tosca and Carmen. Rossini's Il Turco in Italia -- which in 1816 rapidly
moved south from Milan to Piacenza -- returns on April 12 for a series
of performances.
The town's geographical position remains an asset, not merely for
pilgrims. Zubinmehta calls there with the Orchestra of Maggio Musicale
from Florence. The Arturo Toscanini Orchestra of Emilia Romagna comes
regularly from Parma, the conductor's birthplace. The avant-garde
Percussions de Strasbourg dropped in this season. The audacious Ute
Lemper is giving her latest programme, provocatively entitled Immense et
Rouge, though more sedate music-lovers may prefer the spring festival of
sacred and profane vocal music, featuring Bologna's Accademia de'
Floridi.
Concert seats cost about #15 downwards, opera seats about double that.
The theatre box-office is open morning and evening on the day of a
performance, and on the morning of the day before. The phone number is
0523 492251 if you are dialling from inside Italy, or 01039 523 492251
from here in Britain, but don't necessarily expect English to be spoken
-- Piacenza, I repeat, is not on the tourist route.
Like other historic towns of the Emilian plain, Piacenza was once
confined within its walls. Today it sprawls beyond them, and most of its
modern hotels are in the suburbs, handy for the Autostrada del Sole,
less so for exploring the centre. The smartest new hotel, the Albergo
Ouest, stands opposite a cement works, but at least it is on a daytime
bus route into town. At about #60 for a double room including breakfast,
it is a bargain -- and extremely comfortable. If you are touring by car,
this (or the similarly priced Albergo Nazionale not far away) would be
the obvious place to stay.
But for about #70 the Grande Albergo Roma has the advantage, for
pedestrians, of a central location (and a good restaurant) amid the maze
of narrow streets just off the main square. Two other hotels, the Milano
and the Florida, are more basic. Even if your stay is a short one, take
time to eat. Being so close to Bologna -- which is not nicknamed
''Italy's stomach'' for nothing -- Piacenza possesses several
restaurants worth lingering in.
For utterly authentic local cooking, the Agnello da Renato -- just off
the main square at Via Calzolai 1 -- is the place. Don't be daunted by
the little pot of garlicky lard the waiter immediately puts in front of
you. It is an appetiser, the spicy Piacenza equivalent perhaps of bread
and dripping, to be savoured while surveying a menu that lists horse,
donkey stew, pigeon risotto, tripe, and much other offal, but also roast
lamb, roast veal, and osso buco. The locally-named ''pisareie faso'' is
a sort of bean hotpot, pasta comes with sausages, the antipasto is a
grand array of cold meats (this is no place for vegetarians), and the
red wine is a sparkling Gutturnio from the other side of the River Po.
The Agnello, it is said, serves the food a well-bred Piacenza family
might have eaten a century ago. Families still eat in these somewhat
spartan but cheerful and knowledgeable surroundings. In contrast, the
plusher Antica Osteria del Teatro, a few steps from the opera house at
Via Verdi 15, serves creative modern cooking, without neglecting local
produce and traditions. Shellfish and tiny vegetables in pastry, duck
with peaches, lamb with foie gras and spinach, rabbit with Ligurian
olive oil have all been praised. The wines match the food, but eating
and drinking in the beautiful fifteenth-century surroundings (star-rated
by Michelin) does not come cheap.
Gastronomically less challenging than the Agnello, and less expensive
than the Antica Osteria, is Peppino's at Via Roma 183. It's a bit of a
walk along an endless canyon of a street that might well lead to Rome,
but it's a cosy, comforting place, serving good fish and meat. The
Gotico, nearer the main square at Piazza Gioia 3, is also good value.
Before leaving Piacenza, see if the market is in progress in the shadow
of the cathedral. If it's not, there are nevertheless food shops nearby,
one of them selling local hams, another supplying basil and rocket
seeds, worth taking home.
Piacenza is one of the
long-established
stopping points on the
pilgrim route to Rome

EDINBURGH's Festival Theatre seemed a large (and largely empty) space
in which to present Stephen Oliver's triptych of one-act operas -- each
of them a tiny razor-sharp sketch for one, two, or three characters --
last night. But this, as it turned out, was the sort of music that could
expand to fill its surroundings, and make an impact even stronger than
it might have done in the studio theatre for which it could have been
designed.
Unified by the witty title of Passion Killers, by the sloping
terracotta walls of Ana Jebens's decor, by the singing of Richard
Halton, Stephen Rooke, and Ingrid Attrot, and by the Italian (sometimes
E M Forsterish) subject matter, the three pieces in fact looked as good
as they sounded. A writer who has revealed his private relationship with
a close friend in his latest book, a beautiful widow whose perhaps
sinister privacy is invaded in her garden by a stranger, and a gloss on
a pair of Puccini characters, provide the piquant subjects.
The effect was witty, pointed, and poignant, with accompaniments pared
down to the strains of string quartet and harpsichord, and words (by
Oliver himself) mostly clear, even if the fine detail of the speculative
confrontation between Puccini's Cavaradossi and Marcello did not wholly
come across.
The fine detail of the music, however, was always precise and true
under Anne Manson's conductorship, and the transparent textures of the
music -- whether in the mock waltz that underlined the writer's
monologue or the ravishing shimmer of the widow in her garden -- were
beautifully judged.

<HEADLINE>Cash crisis for Highland tourist group</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A TOURISM group set up to sell the Highlands throughout the world is
facing a cash crisis -- and its new chairman has hit out at the Scottish
Office for playing ''political games''.
Inverness hotelier and former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade
Association, Mr Nicol Manson, yesterday said he had been forced to ''put
the begging bowl'' round various local authorities to meet a funding
shortfall.
He said he had known that it was doomed to failure but had to go
through the motions to prove to the Scottish Office and the Scottish
Tourist Board that if they did not come up with the cash needed, the
whole project would founder.
The new organisation -- the Highlands of Scotland and Skye Tourist
Board -- takes over from seven local tourist authorities in April, 1996.
Its task is to market the entire mainland area and Skye.
However, the new board's steering group has been having a rough ride,
with criticism growing from district councils who are unhappy about its
name and choice of headquarters in the Easter Ross village of
Strathpeffer.
It is estimated that #200,000 is needed for transitional costs but the
Scottish Office has told the Scottish Tourist Board that it can
contribute only #100,000.
In order to meet the shortfall, Mr Manson went to all the district
councils in his membership area, seeking #6000 from each.
He also asked local enterprise companies and Highland Regional Council
for financial help. So far, six district councils have turned down the
request. Two others, Skye and Lochalsh and Ross and Cromarty have still
to decide.
Only Highland has agreed to make a contribution.
Mr Manson said:
''I feel that having had to go through this exercise to produce
documentary evidence to the Scottish Office that we can't meet the
shortfall, shows the steering group in a poor light. We have been placed
in a most unfortunate 'piggy in the middle' situation.
''If the money is not forthcoming from other sources, I cannot believe
the Scottish Office and the Scottish Tourist Board will let it fail for
lack of cash.''
Mr Manson said of the new board's critics: ''It is the nature of the
beast in the Highlands to criticise something before it gets off the
ground. The criticisms about the name and location of the headquarters
are, in my opinion, very minor.
''The question of its title can be resolved by contacting the Scottish
Office through the statutory consultation process. What is important is
that we get up and running and achieve what we have to do and that is
play a leading role in the economic development of the Highlands.''
Like most other authorities, Sutherland District Council is unhappy
with the specific inclusion of Skye in the title and have given their
unhappiness over the title as their reason for refusing to contribute.
They are writing to the Scottish Office to object and ask for the name
to be changed.
Inverness District Council don't like the choice of Strathpeffer for
the headquarters, believing the new board is wasting money setting up
new offices in the village.

Ex-SAS man Harry McCallion is swapping anti-terrorist firefights for
battles in the courtroom. Ian Bruce reports
HARRY McCALLION used to kill people for a living. For more than 20
years, he lived out his most violent fantasies as a member of the
Parachute Regiment, the SAS, South African special forces, and the Royal
Ulster Constabulary.
As one of Britain's shadow warriors, he helped instil fear into the
IRA in the bandit country of South Armagh. It was a clandestine campaign
waged with ruthless professionalism, and it broke the power of the
terrorists inside their own heartland at the height of the Troubles in
the mid-1970s.
Now he has emerged, albeit warily, from those same shadows to tell a
remarkable tale of life lived on the ultimate edge. It is a story which
will be frowned upon in official circles. It will certainly earn him no
friends in the SAS headquarters at Hereford. The memoirs of former
members of that elite outfit are not received with enthusiasm. Mystique
can be maintained only if nobody discloses the inside track.
For a Gorbals boy who was a self-confessed thug from the age of five,
leaving school at 16 with no qualifications other than a natural ability
for street-fighting, McCallion has made several quantum leaps on the
learning curve.
For the next two months his time will be occupied sitting law exams.
Instead of tackling terrorists, he will grapple with the intricacies of
jurisprudence as a prelude to a year's ''pupillage'' -- a legal
apprenticeship -- with a leading London law firm. He hopes to become a
criminal barrister.
With several lifetimes-worth of adventure behind him, he has
discovered a passion for the precision of the legal process, and a
burning desire to be part of the cut-and-thrust of courtroom debate
rather than its counterpart in close-quarter battle.
''I've killed people,'' he admits. ''More people than I care to
remember. But I've no regrets about that. Anyone I had to take out was
hardly a sweet and kindly soul. It's something I don't dwell on. I
always accepted the forces' basic philosophy that if you can't take a
joke, then you shouldn't join.''
While serving with the SAS-style South African ''recces'', he recalls
helping leave grisly calling-cards to dent Frelimo terrorist morale.
After ambushes, he and his comrades would decapitate enemy dead and set
booby-traps under the severed heads.
These were usually fragmentation grenades or anti-personnel mines set
to explode when pressure on them was released. If any other Frelimo
guerrillas decided to give their former buddies a decent burial, the
weapons would explode.
His book, Killing Zone, pulls no punches. But it also tries to make a
few solid points and debunk a few myths. One is the oft-repeated claim
that the British Army's special forces, in collusion with the RUC and
Protestant paramilitaries, carried out a ''shoot-to-kill'' policy in
Northern Ireland.
''That's just pure nonsense. If there had been any such policy, there
would be a lot fewer Republican hardliners in Armagh, Tyrone, and
Belfast right now. Sinn Fein and their fellow-travellers used the claim
as propaganda, but it was just not true.
''In fact the SAS did not take Ulster seriously at first. We learned a
few hard lessons before we came to grips with the problems, particularly
in the border areas.
''But we were always on a leash. Like any other unit serving there, we
had to adhere to the 'Yellow Card' rules of engagement. This basically
states that you can't open fire unless the opposition guy has a weapon
in his hands and is about to use it. It's a crazy way to make war.
''In six years we took out perhaps 30 hardcore terrorists. It was
truly frustrating. We knew who the main IRA players were. We just
couldn't touch them unless we caught them red-handed. It wasn't my idea
of the best use of special forces.''
The SAS portion of McCallion's time in the province followed adventure
elsewhere. After six tours with the Parachute Regiment, he had had
enough of the cat-and-mouse lifestyle of service in Northern Ireland.
Frustration took him next to South Africa, then fighting a hit-and-run
campaign against communist-trained insurgents from frontline black
African states. His next three years were spent killing guerrillas in
Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, and Rhodesia. ''We were holding the line
against the communists at a time when the West refused to believe, or
perhaps chose not to, that South Africa was in danger of being
overrun,'' he says.
''Everyone there, including some of the most diehard Boers I ever met,
realised that things had to change. The day of ultimate white supremacy
was at an end. But the transition had to be orderly, and the regime
which finally displaced what had gone before had to be democratic.
''That's why I was fighting there. I'm no racist, although I'm
intensely proud to be a Scot. I take people as I find them. There's no
other way. It's a lesson it's taken me a long time to learn.''
McCallion's family, who still live in Glasgow, are Catholic by
religion and Republican by outlook. He has had little contact with them
over the years. It remains a source of regret to him. ''They could not
accept publicly my attitude to the IRA. It's made us strangers. But I'm
proud of what I did in Northern Ireland.
''Like many Republican supporters, my family didn't have to see the
results of IRA bomb atrocities, or the murders they carried out in the
name of The Cause. Ethnic background doesn't matter when one is dealing
with killers and terrorists who will happily plant a bomb in a public
place, regardless of the risks to innocent victims.''
His desire to see justice done took him to the RUC after two tours
with the SAS. It also kindled the spark of his next career in law. Then
a near-fatal car crash ended his active participation in operations.
After a long and painful recovery from his injuries, he decided he
must take a new track. It must be something civilian, with enough
intellectual excitement to satisfy an inquiring mind. The alternative
would have been the start of a downward spiral.
''A lot of ex-SAS hands get themselves locked into what is known as
'the circuit'. They're taken on by the kind of security firms who
provide bodyguards for VIPs and training for would-be bodyguards.
''A good bloke can earn #30,000 to #40,000 a year, but it's a bloody
boring existence. Many find themselves chasing the next war, signing up
as mercenaries for anyone who'll get them into a fight.
''That's a course which usually buys a one-way ticket. There's
precious little money in the mercenary game these days. The genuine guys
are going for the adrenalin rush of a return to combat. Some might even
fancy the cause. But it's a dicey game for old soldiers.''
Before our interview in Glasgow, the last time McCallion and I met was
in a commandeered house in Port Stanley two days after the Argentinians
surrendered in the Falklands. We got very drunk. I was relieved that it
was over and I was still alive. He was in despair because a kamikaze
operation to land his entire SAS squadron on an Argie mainland airfield
had been cancelled at the last minute.
It is the measure of the man that the wilder side of his existence --
''if you don't care about your own life, you won't care about ending
someone else's'' -- is a phase which seems to have passed.
At 42, on the brink of yet another career, he is a thoughtful,
entertaining man filled with hope for the future. In 18 months' time he
will try to find the time for another book, charting the story of
special forces operations in Ulster through 25 years of conflict.

Flash specs can suggest the wearer is much more exciting than he
really is. Anvar Khan, UK Feature Writer of the Year, describes what
gives sunspecs their star appeal
THE popularity of sunspecs is comparable to the cult of the
personality tie. Personality ties come in various splashy designs. The
trashy, Mondrian take-off, the neon strip of US stars and stripes, the
still life of sunflowers and pansies and grapes, all apologies for
dressing with character. Such ties are mostly worn by advertising
executives, off-duty professional footballers, newsreaders, critics, and
commentators, any job which demands a colourful performance.
The maxim that empty vessels make the most noise here, though, can't
be applied. The bolder, bigger, and brighter the pattern of a tie,
chances are, there's a shy, fairly quiet, domestic pussycat underneath.
In this way, the personality tie provides a good service. It suggests
that the wearer is much more exciting than he really is. Flash specs can
do this too.
Dark glasses are unisex, all seeing, without giving anything away.
They are a blindfold, but it's the rest of the world which is darkened
and held in reserve. This is what gives sunspecs their star quality.
Their complete contempt. Lack of eye contact is quite rightly regarded
as shifty. Hiding the most expressive part of the face is all-out
intimidation. Dark glasses, however, do not always have an agenda.
Yes, the accessory is pretentious and protective of the wearer. It is,
however, possible to wear a set for practical reasons, such as fending
off harmful UV rays. But let's not bore ourselves with them. Here is The
Herald's definitive buyers' guide as to what shapes and styles are
currently available and at what economic and social cost.

<TEXT>
THE Fayed brothers -- the Egyptian-born owners of Harrods -- won
permission yesterday to bring a High Court challenge against Home Office
refusals to grant them British citizenship.
Despite opposition from Home Secretary Michael Howard, a judge ruled
that Mohamed Al Fayed, 62, chairman of Harrods Ltd, and Ali Fayed, 51,
were entitled to argue that the procedures which led to the refusals in
February, without reasons being given, were a ''blatant'' denial of
natural justice.
Mr Justice Popplewell said it was ''an arguable point'' which raised
matters ''of some considerable constitutional importance'', and gave the
brothers leave to seek a judicial review.
Mr Michael Beloff, QC, appearing for the Fayeds, told the court there
were concerns that the applications were blocked for improper
''political'' motives.
He said: ''It is common ground that at no time either before, in, or
after the decisions, has either brother been told the reason for the
adverse decision, and it follows that at no time has either brother had
any fair opportunity of disabusing the Secretary of State of what
apparently concerned him in respect of the applicants.''
Mr Beloff said it was difficult to see what could be more unfair than
to take a decision ''of such sensitivity so as to leave the victim in
the dark as to his possible fate and deny him the opportunity to avoid
it''.
Later, in the food hall at Harrods, Mr Al Fayed said through a
spokesman: ''I'm very pleased by today's result. It's now up to the
courts. I am totally committed to Britain and now the real reasons for
the Home Office's decision can come out.''

A BANK robber who was caught when he stopped his getaway car at a red
light was admonished yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Derek McFadden, 31, admitted taking #2475 from the Clydesdale Bank in
Fenwick Road, Giffnock, on February 17 last year.
The judge, Lord Abernethy, was told that McFadden, an office manager,
of Bankhead Road, Rutherglen, had entered the bank about 2.35pm and
demanded a teller fill a carrier bag with cash. He shouted: ''I have got
a gun.''
He was carrying a toy pistol in the waistband of his trousers. As
McFadden ran from the bank, two witnesses alerted a police car, which
pursued his getaway car.
McFadden was detained soon afterwards when he stopped his car at red
traffic lights and he later confessed to the robbery.
The judge was told that the accused had accumulated heavy gambling
debts, and his depressed and anxious state had led to the breakdown of
his relationship with his girlfriend.
On the day of the robbery, he had driven around pondering two options
-- whether to commit suicide or try to get some money to start afresh.
After calling for psychiatric reports last year, Lord Abernethy
deferred sentence for a year for McFadden to be of good behaviour.
He told McFadden that, normally, an offence of this kind would attract
a lengthy prison sentence but he took into account the considerable
remorse shown by the accused and did not think he was a continuing
danger to the public.

ROSEMARY West pleaded not guilty yesterday to 10 counts of murder.
The mother-of-seven lived at 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester with
husband Frederick, 53, who was found hanging in his cell in Birmingham
prison on New Year's Day. Twelve murder charges against him have been
formally dropped.
Yesterday, Mrs West, 41, appeared at Winchester Crown Court and also
pleaded not guilty to four further counts alleging rape and indecent
assaults against two girls.
She spoke only to identify herself formally and to give pleas to an
indictment of 14 charges. To each charge she answered ''not guilty'' in
a firm, clear voice.
The formal pleas were taken before Mr Justice Mantell at a hearing in
the packed No. 3 court.
The hearing lasted more than 20 minutes in public but, following the
plea taking, the court continued in private to discuss legal matters.
It was the first time Mrs West had answered publicly the allegations
of murder arising from the Cromwell Street inquiry.
The judge made a court order underlining the limited reporting
provisions.
He also ordered that nothing should be published which could lead to
the identification of the alleged child victims in the rape accusations.
The charges arise from the discovery of nine sets of human remains in
the house and garden at 25 Cromwell Street in February and March of last
year and one set of remains found at her former home at 25 Midland Road,
Gloucester.
The murder charges cover a 16-year period to June 1987.
Before going into private session, the judge indicated that Mrs West's
trial would start on October 3 and could last at least six weeks.
After the hearing, Mrs West was driven from the court in a darkened
police van, escorted by two outriders.

SPLITTING
Fay Weldon
Flamingo, #14.99
BEFORE Fay Weldon, the fictional women of Britain were good at heart
or, if not good, merely disagreeable. When, in real life, you met an
utter sleaze queen, you had to turn right back to Becky Sharp for any
sort of help from literature.
Fay Weldon changed that. Thankful cries of recognition were as loud as
the critical acclaim for her early novels, and her lasting gift to women
has been the articulation of the concept of sisterly behaviour, or
rather its converse, unsisterly behaviour: the collusion of unscrupulous
woman with bastard man.
Whenever a predatory House of Commons researcher causes an unhappy
Junior Minister's wife to be photographed on her doorstep looking
plucky, Weldonian unsisterliness is the charge that comes to mind. So we
can forgive her, can we not, for novels whose nutritional equivalent is
something like boil-in-the-bag llama kidneys -- sustaining in an
outlandish sort of way but a mite familiar as they hit the plate.
Splitting, in fact, has a plump central section subtitled ''Ajax's Aga
Saga'' which ambles along very pleasantly, informing and fleshing out
characters as is the wont of more conforming writers. This Ajax is the
male (therefore simplest) component of the split personality of one Lady
Angelica Rice, rejected and about to be divorced by her husband Edwin so
that he may marry his cousin Anthea.
The wretched but dignified Lady R hides out in a room in the Cavendish
Hotel, charged to her unwitting husband's estate, while her separate
selves splinter off and, squabbling over the use of the physical body,
set about finding their own solutions.
Angelica, the premarital self, a one-hit pop star with Kinky Virgin,
does a lot of harking back. Jelly, the capable self, takes a job as
secretary to Brian Moss, Edwin's solicitor, in order to manipulate the
divorce settlement. Angel, the slag, hangs out in the Cavendish bar in
mini-skirt and thigh boots, or grapples with Ram, the chauffeur, in the
back seat of the limo.
Single-minded and self-righteous though they are, the selves are not
above conniving two or three against one when it suits them. Their
dialogue becomes tedious and over-extended, mainly because Weldon is
trying to retain credibility in a naturalistic reading of the story -- a
jarring insistence on the mechanics of the split and its outward
appearance. She is better when she slots in evidence from the life --
the child bride Angelica, for instance, intact in her grunge gear,
contained something of the embryonic tart Angel, though Lady Rice
prefers to forget that. All recall is suspect. Complex aspects of the
female self share the blame for the marriage breakdown with
straightforward aspects of maleness. Chance plays a part. Fate is blind.
Edwin is better off with Anthea anyway.
There is just one essentially culpable figure, and so that she will
slip softly into the picture as does her archetype in real life, she is
introduced in the Aga Saga. She is that hangover from the sixties, the
predatory sweet woman who gathers husbands like wild flowers and always
has her behaviour condoned as guileless.
She is Susan and she is American and a potter ''with her bubbling
enthusiasms, her fair shiny hair, her attractive naivety . . . for ever
bearing gifts''. She it is who subverts every husband in the little
arty-crafty social group around Rice Court, sundering families,
disturbing children and ultimately bringing about the collapse of
Angelica's marriage. In the remorseless Weldon format, where neither
heroes nor villains are sustainable, it is pleasant to come upon an
object of pure spite.
The men -- Edwin, Brian Moss, a few husbands -- are minor, fixed
characters: they have the money and the power, they don't need to be
interesting. It is the essential powerlessness of the women that gives
them complexity and force. This is, of course, as much to be expected in
a Weldon work as the knife-like prose, but the split selves make the
point with an unusual intensity. The emotions of rejection --
self-justification and self-blame -- have seldom had such an airing.
In a side-plot, a very ancient -- and, in their worn-out domesticity,
happy -- pair, Wendy and Congo, live and die in squalor in the crumbling
Lodestar House, defying Wendy's granddaughter's attempts to reclaim it.
She, Sarah, is a rather unattractive person. Less so, though, than the
nature of her birth -- her mother, Una, seduced her stepfather, Wendy's
second husband. The consequences of sin fall upon the innocent, and the
old and unattractive have to take the place of heroes.
In an inventively squalid ending, Una and her team of gender-benders
take over Lodestar House for a party where every guest takes on the
identity of his or her choice, and joins the ghosts in orgiastic union.
Nothing that pertains to glamour or desire, Weldon seems to be saying,
is nice or constant. Brian Moss's stolid wife, fuming on a bench in the
hall, explaining the ghosts as ''secondary smoking'' is ordinariness in
all its sober incorruptibility.
As always, Weldon reflects the mood of the times absolutely. The new
puritanism that marks the final swing away from the ill-thought-out
sexual revolution of the sixties will find the whole exercise pointed
and vindicating.

LABOUR'S Scottish Home Affairs spokesman has launched a scathing
attack on the Government's failure to tackle law and order after new
figures reveal a soaring crime rate in Scotland's three major cities.
Statistics released by the Scottish Office yesterday show that crime
in Glasgow is running at 74% above the Scottish average, while criminal
activity in Dundee and Edinburgh follows a similar trend.
A detailed statistical profile of Scotland's new single-tier
authorities -- including figures on academic qualification, economic
activity, and home and car ownership -- has been compiled to help the
the new ''shadow'' councils plan for the assumption of full local
government powers on April 1.
While crime rates per head of the population vary considerably from
council to council, the City of Glasgow in 1993 had the highest number
of recorded crimes per head of population.
At 1845, crimes per 10,000 persons, it was 74% above the Scottish
average of 1061 per 10,000.
Glasgow was followed by the City of Dundee at 65% above the national
average while the City of Edinburgh had 32% above the mean.
Of the non-city authorities, four council areas had crime rates above
the Scottish average: Renfrewshire (26% above); Dumbarton and Clydebank
(7% above); North Ayrshire (7% above); and South Lanarkshire (2% above).
Last night, Mr John McFall MP, Labour's Scottish Home Affairs
spokesman said the figures made grim reading and ''gave a lie'' to
Government assertions that crime rates were decreasing.
''Most worrying is that in certain categories -- particularly crimes
against the person -- crime rates are going up,'' he said.
''People are becoming more and more insecure in big city centres and
this is bound to affect public confidence in the police and the
Government.
''Where urban aid schemes have been introduced they have got the crime
rate down but these are now coming to an end.
''The hiatus between the Government, the police and local authorities
is becoming too big to deny. The Government is not taking the rise in
crime seriously enough and not giving local authorities the necessary
resources to tackle the problem.''
However, Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said it was
now up to the new single- tier local authorities to target funds at
areas which required action.
''The reform of local government in Scotland gives new councils a
golden opportunity to strengthen local government and develop services
more closely in tune with local needs,'' he added.
''Some #8 billion is spent each year by local authorities and it is
vital this money is targeted on the services and areas where it will be
most effective.''
In 1991, Aberdeenshire had the most cars available per household with
an average of 1.1. The City of Glasgow had the least with, on average,
0.4 cars per household.

SCOTLAND'S HISTORY, APPROACHES AND REFLECTIONS
Gordon Donaldson
Scottish Academic Press, #15
PROFESSOR Gordon Donaldson, the late historiographer-royal of
Scotland, was an interesting man whose life and thinking reflected many
of the complexities of the nation as a whole. He was, first and
foremost, an outstanding scholar capable also of arousing the devotion
of his students, among them James Kirk, the editor of this posthumous
collection of lectures and essays. His intellectual liberality did not
preclude the crustiness we might expect in an academic of the old
school. But then, his profound knowledge of Scottish historical records
surely entitled him to a certain degree of pedantry.
This did not always make him popular outside his own circle. It may be
a pity, because we otherwise miss some of the flavour of the man, that
none of his reviews are included in this volume. His favourite way of
assessing other people's publications was to go through them and count
the errors of fact, a method neither calculated to endear him to authors
nor in every case to give a good idea of their real merits, since it is
impossible to write long books without making mistakes. Donaldson indeed
tots up some of his own in one of the pieces here. Without doubt,
though, such rigid and exact scholarship did have the virtue of pricking
facile opinions and occasionally of opening up freesh fresh vistas over
well-ploughed ground.
The frequent obverse of dryness is wit, and of this too Donaldson had
more than his need. From these pages it is often almost possible to hear
his authentic voice, to sense the unexpected pause before the
devastating punch-line. In fact there is cause to wonder how the texts
were prepared: did Donaldson really write down somewhere all these
little digressions and asides? That he did, if he did, says a great deal
about his unwillingness to leave anything to chance.
Learned and entertaining though he comes out, it must be said that
Donaldson was no Lord Acton. He could be imaginative about subjects
close to his heart, such as the Shetland Isles from which his family
hailed. At the same time he did, perhaps inevitably in such a large and
wide-ranging output, sometimes write things which were rather slight.
The approaches to Scottish history which the collection is meant to
illustrate do not seem to me to add up in the end to anything much more
startling than that the scholar should be master of his sources. As for
reflections, Donaldson sets out in one essay how Scotland's history has
been more closely connected with Europe's, and so less insular, than
England's. In another he stresses that Scotland should not be compared
at every turn with an England still over-impressed with her own
historical myths. In a third he points out that, nevertheless, the
anglicisation of Scotland has been going on for a very long time, indeed
almost from the outset of anything we can call Scottish history.
These things are all worth saying, yet they are nowadays pretty much
common coin in the highly interesting but undervalued Scottish debate on
historiography, on the way we write history, as opposed to the facts
actually recounted. The debate has reached a level of sophistication at
which barbed witticisms no longer really do justice to it. In the
biography which Kirk is planning, he would do well to place Donaldson in
that debate, or as a precursor of it, more systematically.

A FRIEND once opened his freezer to show me the bag of a shooting
weekend. Wrapped in clingfilm was a little pile of fist-sized plucked
bodies, the edible remains of woodcock. The woodcock is a secretive
victim. It is so physiologically adapted to being hunted that it has
binocular vision behind its head as well as in front. This is vital when
your bill is up to the hilt in a damp field at night, feeling out
earthworms. So much evolution to so little avail, for the bodies in the
freezer.
In your headlights, only the regularity of its chestnut and black
plumage defines a sitting woodcock against its background of leaf mould
and litter. In winter they leave their thickets from eight minutes after
sunset and return up to 19 minutes before sunrise from the fields. If
you stumble across one by day it swerves through the trees and dives
quickly for cover -- a difficult shot.
Every persecuted group has its hour. For woodcock this is at dusk in
spring, when the males follow the direct, rocking display flight known
as ''roding'' along wood edges. In the long Highland twilight you hear
the deep approaching croak and as the silhouette passes over you can
pick up the risping call with which it is regularly alternated. If the
moon is up you can see why ''some thought to northern coasts their
flight they tend, or to the moon in midnight hour ascend'' (John Gay,
1714).
In October continental woodcock fly into eastern coasts and a later
folk tale says they are piloted by goldcrests. They tumble off the North
Sea into the first patch of golf course furze, already alive with
goldcrests. The old explanations may be false, but the observation is
always true.

Lesley Duncan marvels at the corsetry-inspired furniture of Precious
McBane and, in contrast, the gothic-style tables and chairs of a Glasgow
cafe
WHAT constitutes good design? The question continues to exercise
aesthetic theorists. As Drew Plunkett, head of interior design at
Glasgow School of Art, comments in the catalogue to a new exhibition,
Designers' Habitats, at Glasgow's Collins Gallery, ''The excesses of
popular taste and the cliches of elitist taste are equally demoralising
. . . ''
Good design has, one supposes, to be apt for its function. It should
also stimulate with its wit or aesthetic appeal; raise the spirits, even
if the user or viewer is not consciously analysing the ''feel-good
factor'' generated. There is plenty to stimulate at the Collins
exhibition whose 22 subjects range from the Cafe Gandolfi in Glasgow to
the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London; from
schools and libraries to shops, hairdressers', and surgeries.
For Glasgow's Merchant City habitues the Gandolfi corner is a familiar
setting. The characteristic heavy wooden furniture -- with its relish
for natural forms and somewhat gothic air -- is represented by various
pieces. The cafe, created in 1979, is the earliest ''habitat'' in the
show and represents the collaboration of patron Iain Mackenzie and
craftsman Tim Stead.
How Mackenzie pursued ''a hopelessly idealistic and romantic notion''
to transform the derelict red-sandstone cheese-market offices into a
cafe is one of the city's happier modern occurrences. For Stead, the
enjoyment came from ''the opportunity of creating an environment which
did not consist of regimented tables and chairs''. His pleasure in the
individuality of his furniture communicates itself to the public.
John Clark's stained-glass windows -- entitled A Flock of Fish
(whatever happened to shoals?) -- add to the cafe's colourful atmosphere
as well as reflecting a Victorian decorative tradition in Glasgow. All
this without even eating!
An altogether more challenging assignment faced the designers involved
in the Great Ormond Street hospital project -- an ambitious undertaking
funded by the Government and the Wishing Well Appeal to create an
interior design covering five floors. ''The atmosphere was to be relaxed
and friendly but colours, shapes, and textures had to be carefully
selected on the basis of their psychological impact upon sick children.
Imagery was to be interesting yet calm.''
Much of the work involved repeating some 18 metres of original artwork
to cover 260 metres of wall, using a silkscreen process baked on
laminate. The results are highly engaging. Elephants, giraffes, and
lions browse, while birds fly in a blue band overhead, in one
composition both cheerful and tranquil. Another design has butterflies,
sheep, hares, and foxes -- a rural idyll to soothe young patients. A
cutlery corner is guarded by a very unalarming (though with an alarm
clock in its jaws) crocodile. Shades of Peter Pan.
Humour is a bit more robust -- or just busty? -- in the design for
Boisvert Lingerie of Neal Street, London. The American owner of this
little underwear boutique wanted an interior to reflect her stock. She
commissioned the design team Precious McBane to create original
furnishings.
Precious McBane (the literary joke is noted) are three Scottish
''designer-makers'', Evlynn Smith, Meriel Scott, and Lynn Campbell
Miller. Their witty items include a chair tricked out as a lilac corset,
laced tightly up the back, and little footstools wearing frilly satin
knickers.
Designers please themselves as well as reacting to commissions. Some
of the most covetable exhibits in the show are by the furniture designer
and maker N M McCance, who trained as a cabinetmaker but became
disillusioned with ''veneered junk''. Born in Glasgow and now based in
Fife, McCance has worked in both Italy and Los Angeles. He is an
advocate of ''technorganic'' design, combining forms seen in nature with
modern construction techniques. He works almost exclusively in hard
woods.
Imagination combined with fine material lends special charm to his
little tables -- at once functional and works of art. One is supported
by what is almost a Mobius band in wood. Another is propped up by a
group of what may be craning birds (shags or guillemots?), though
McCance says his starting point was seaweed. There are also ingenious
cabinets with pseudo-knots or bevelled fronts -- much too splendid for
the household gargle and paracetamol -- and elongated heads in layered
wood. No wonder Alison Stewart of Glenrothes was delighted with
McCance's furnishings for her hairdressing salon or that McCance's
quirky designs for Rod McLellan's salon in Markinch draw admiring
visitors.
Individual inspiration wins the day.

ABOUT 4000 demonstrators, including several Labour MPs, marched past
the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow yesterday shortly before the Prime
Minister addressed the Tory Party faithful.
The purpose of the demonstration, which was organised by the Scottish
TUC, was to ''give people in Scotland the opportunity to demand of the
Government the right to decide how the country is governed and to call
upon the Prime Minister to hold a General Election immediately''.
The marchers, led by the GMB union pipe band, included a broad
spectrum of people who claim to be ''disillusioned'' by the Government's
policies.
There were nurses, teachers, rail and Post Office workers, employees
from Rolls-Royce and Scottish Nuclear, as well as representatives of the
unemployed and pensioners' groups.
There was a heavy police presence as the demonstrators, many holding
up red cards and blowing whistles, marched past the concert hall, with
some demanding: ''Major, Major -- out, out, out.''
Labour MPs John McFall, Maria Fyfe, Dennis Canavan, and Adam Ingram
were assisted by STUC depute general secretary, Mr Bill Speirs, in
helping to carry the main banner which demanded an immediate General
Election.
The marchers rallied in George Square, where they heard addresses from
several speakers including Mr McFall, depute Shadow Scottish Secretary,
and SNP leader Alex Salmond.
Mr McFall told the rally: ''The Tories have a contempt for the
unemployed, a callousness towards the old, and an eagerness to take
every shred of dignity and security from the workers.
''Whether we talk about rail, health, education, or any other
Government policies, they have all been roundly and robustly opposed by
the majority of the population.
''It is difficult to think of a name for John Major -- but one that
comes to mind is General Custer, because this is indeed his last
stand.''
Mr Salmond said: ''John Major is telling delegates in the concert hall
that he is fizzing with ideas. Scotland is fizzing with John Major and
the Tories.
''His time is coming to an end and he knows it.''
The SNP leader went on: ''Ian Lang once said Scotland was a burden on
the Tory party. The truth is, the Tory party is a burden on Scotland.''
Mr Salmond urged Mr Major to pay heed to the warning from Oliver
Cromwell to the Rump Parliament and adapted by Leopold Amery to Neville
Chamberlain in May 1940: ''You have sat here too long for any good you
are doing. In the name of God, go, and go now.''
Earlier, staff from Scottish Nuclear staged a lunchtime lobby of
delegates attending the Tory conference.
Staff carried placards declaring ''no to privatisation'' and ''nuclear
must stay public''.
A joint trades union spokesman, representing Scottish Nuclear
employees, yesterday said that the campaign opposing the Government's
plans for the industry would be stepped up next week.
He said the Government's White Paper on nuclear industry privatisation
would be debated in the House of Commons next Wednesday evening.
He added that Mr Major and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had declined
invitations to meet joint trade union representatives.
However, Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch has agreed to meet
representatives at the Scottish Office next Thursday.
Union representatives will also meet their counterparts from Nuclear
Electric in either London or Gloucester on the same day.
The spokesman claimed the workers' campaign had been effectively
''gagged'' because of restrictions laid down by the Financial Services
Act.
The Act precludes employees from doing anything which may affect the
company's profits in the coming year.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday called for a new understanding
between British business and his party.
His call was made to delegates to the British Chambers of Commerce
annual conference in Aberdeen.
Mr Blair said that for far too long, his party's relations with
business had been merely about reassurance.
''I want more than that. I want a proper constructive dialogue, a new
understanding between a party serious about governing Britain well and a
business community prepared to look to the future.
''If we are to govern, then I want that Government to be successful. I
want it to be remembered as a Government which promoted British business
and industry, did it well and created not only a fair society with
greater opportunity for people but a more dynamic and more stable
economy,'' he said.
Mr Blair said he supported the Social Charter and made it clear that
he believed a minimum wage would help eliminate inefficiency as well as
injustice in the Britain his party envisages.
He said there was some good news within the British economy but there
were fundamental weaknesses.
''The public rift in the past 48 hours between the Bank of England and
the Chancellor was damaging in itself.
''Damaging too is the clear doubt in the Bank's view whether
Government policy is now driven by short-term political factors. But
most worrying is that we are having to even contemplate raising interest
rates to slow down economic activity when for many families, homeowners,
and businesses we are barely out of the last recession.''
The two long-term weaknesses were the boom and bust economic roller
coaster of recent years and the decline of Britain's competitiveness in
comparison with others.
''We are jostling for space in an increasingly crowded world market
place and this new economic map is a challenge to Britain but also an
opportunity.
''We must shake away the complacency of too many people in Government,
business, and the unions who are willing to accept second best and sweep
away any old-fashioned approaches and attitudes which hold us back,'' he
said. The aim of a new industrial or economic policy should therefore be
to identify the key objectives which business and Government share and
then work in partnership to achieve them, the Labour leader added.
Mr Blair also said he saw education and training as top of his list of
economic priorities, while new technology had to be harnessed and
spread.
Investment and longer-term thinking had to be encouraged and endemic
unemployment tackled.
Labour, he said, planned to open up markets around the world for
British business and remove barriers to fair competition within the EU
and negotiate the removal of unfair practices in Japan.
* John Major and Tony Blair are running neck-and-neck as the best
politicians to lead Britain into the next century, a survey of
businessmen at the conference showed. Both attracted 31% of votes from
delegates.
Mr Blair has closed the gap on the Prime Minister, who was two
percentage points ahead of him in a similar survey at last year's
conference in Birmingham. Nearly 75% believe the ditching of Clause 4,
which committed Labour to wholesale nationalisation, has made Labour
more electable.
Delegates were equally divided on whether the Tory Party has a better
chance of being re-elected with Mr Major as leader.
Other findings of the survey show that 59% support a single European
currency and do not want a referendum on Europe; 69% are against
devolution; 79% do not think legislation is needed to limit executive
pay, although 35% believe measures are necessary to curb excesses in
privatised industries; the three most important factors influencing
delegates' businesses are low inflation, low interest rates, and
increased investment in education and training.

* NEL, the East Kilbride-based engineering technology services
organisation, in conjunction with St George's Hospital in London, has
developed a 3-D facial imaging system that could provide surgeons with a
faster, safer method of carrying out reconstructive and plastic surgery.
The outcome of a seven-year R&amp;D programme, the OrthoForm system provides
a non-contact, non-invasive method of capturing large amounts of data
prior to the commencement of surgical procedures. Derek Lee, sales and
marketing director of NEL, said: ''The development of this system opens
up a whole host of applications including facial recognition for
security applications, the digitisation of design models, prototypes and
fine art objects for computerised archival and reproduction, computer
animation and virtual reality.'' Details from NEL on 013552 20222.
* MICROBES, Bugs and Wonder Drugs, the first book in the Making Sense

purchases.
There is a proliferation of models on the market to choose from, but
three new products from Fujitsu ICL, which are due in the shops later
this month, have been designed with the home user in mind.
The Indiana range comes complete with software that provides the user
with clear assistance, and a simple Windows-style tutorial is
incorporated for novice users. The basic model, the Indiana Standard,
costs #799 while the Indiana Multimedia and Power Multimedia models, at
#1999 and #1599, are both fitted with a double speed CD-ROM drive, a
SoundBlaster, an FM synthesiser, and an interface that allows external
instruments, such as an electronic keyboard, to be connected.

Yvonne Wightman forecasts fewer deaths on the mountains, and improved
health service efficiency
SINCE 1977 there has been an automatic weather station at the 1245m
summit of Cairngorm recording data in one of the UK's most severe
climates, but a recent new addition to the station may help to reduce
the number of accidents and deaths in the Scottish mountains by
providing better weather information to mountaineers, skiers, and
walkers.
Heriot Watt University and VVL, part of Edinburgh-based Vision Group
plc, have combined their expertise and technology to install an imputer
smart camera with on-board processing capability at the weather station
and this will allow the view from the top of Cairngorm to be scanned for
three minutes every half hour, 48 observations per day, with the images
sent by radio link to the Met Office, to Ceefax, and to the nearby ski
area for display as an aid to public awareness of mountain weather
conditions.
Professor Des Smith of the department of physics at Heriot Watt, who
has been in charge of the university project team, said: ''Traditionally
there has been limited good-quality mountain weather data. Development
of forecasting techniques has had to rely on widely variable general
observations over large areas, rather than site-specific conditions.''
The teams involved, which include the Met Office and the ski centres,
are keen to progress the project further. ''We hope Cairngorm is just
the start,'' continued Professor Smith. ''There is no doubt that
observation data adds a critical new level to the information we have
and enables both better forecasting and higher public awareness. I would
like to see similar installations across the UK providing accurate
weather information to the many users of our mountains.''
A sample of the new information is already on the World Wide Web and
can be accessed on: http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/cairngorm/cgpic.html.
* WE'VE ALL heard the apocryphal doctor-to-patient stories along the
lines of, ''Do you want the good news or the bad news?'' However, the
days of wrong leg, wrong kidney, wrong body may be a thing of the past
thanks to a new patient tracker system developed by Professor Malcolm
Atkinson of Glasgow University.
The result of five year's work, the new computerised system allows
patients' medical records to follow them through every visit to
hospital, whether to ward or theatre or day clinic and doctors,
pharmacists, administrators or statisticians can access information
without having to refer to different databases or bundles of paper
records.
The Health Management System, which uses intuitively usable interfaces
(this means that wards on the screen look like real wards and patient
records are laid out in a familiar manner) allows a nurse to sit at a
single terminal that displays the layout of the ward, with patients in
place, different colours indicate gender, doctors, and other relevant
information.
Data is input via a simple point-and-click method and can be updated
or retrieved instantaneously.
''The system is incredibly labour-saving and reduces errors,'' said
Professor Atkinson. ''Records even follow the patient to the operating
theatre, where the surgeon can access the latest information from, say,
pathology or haematology and it also means that the moment a bed is free
this information is immediately available.''
The system is already in use at St Thomas's and Guy's Hospital in
London and is being installed by Glasgow's Southern General Hospital
Trust. In time it is hoped to extend the facility to GP surgeries so
that records would be instantly available wherever the patient happened
to be.
* A WHILE back, I watched one of those investigative diet-scare TV
programmes on the subject of what actually goes into our food. The
programme was on the subject of hydrogenated vegetable oils and the
screen was filled with vats full with great globs of yellow gunk that
looked like mayonnaise past its fridge-by-date.
Scientists have confirmed that this hydrogenated gunge-making process
actually creates a new type of fat not found in nature, called
trans-isomeric fatty acids, otherwise known as trans-fats. There has
long been social and medical pressure to reduce the consumption of
dietary fat, associated with a variety of health problems in the West,
but scientists have now discovered that these trans-fats, which are new
to the food chain and can account for as much as 12% of our total fat
intake, could be responsible for thousands of heart deaths.
Dr Dino Rotondo, of the department of immunology at Strathclyde
University, is investigating the role of both naturally occurring
long-chain and trans-fatty acids in normal physiological immune cell
regulation and the effects of fatty acid ingestion.
Dr Rotondo hopes his research will give a better understanding of the
effects of fatty acids and in the long term there will be a clearer view
of the range of fats which should be included, or excluded, from the
diet. Meantime, keep checking those labels.

* SINCE announcing the invention of ''Supercrete'', a superstrong
version of concrete that has the potential to revolutionise the heavy
end of the construction industry, Dundee University has been inundated
with calls from around the world seeking more information on the new
product which has three or four times the compressive strength of
ordinary concrete.
''Nothing can touch this material,'' said Dr Rod Jones of the
university's department of civil engineering. ''But if Supercrete
fulfils its early promise and can be fully harnessed, it could have a
radical effect on the construction industry.''

A LIKELY English legal challenge to Labour over its all-women
shortlists could threaten the party's selection process in Scottish
marginal seats, it was revealed last night.
Part-time law lecturer Mr Peter Jepson yesterday said he would claim
sexual discrimination after being prevented from putting himself forward
for the new London seat of Regent's Park and Kensington North after
coming up against a women-only shortlist.
Two months ago, the Ayr constituency Labour Party spearheaded the
drive to increase the representation of women in Parliament, when it
announced it would be insisting on a female-only shortlist in selecting
its candidate to fight the seat in any forthcoming election.
The association became the first in Scotland to volunteer to restrict
its selection on the basis of gender, going along with a conference
decision to insist on women candidates in 50% of seats assessed as
''winnable''.
A month later, the Stirling constituency Labour Party voted 28-3 in
favour of adopting a similar policy.
There is also the possibility of an all-woman short-leet in at least
one of the following four marginals: Tory-held Aberdeen South, the new
Aberdeen Central seat, the Inverness, Nairn, and Lochaber seat, a
Liberal-Democrat marginal, where Sir Russell Johnston is stepping down;
and Motherwell South, where Labour's Dr Jeremy Bray is retiring.
Last night, English party officials were said to be ''relaxed'' at the
prospect of the Regent's Park case going to an industrial tribunal.
A spokesman said the local constituency party had voted overwhelmingly
in favour of an all-women shortlist. The two women on the list both came
from the constituency -- unlike Mr Jepson, who lived elsewhere in
London.
He added that the party's policy that 50% of marginal seats should be
contested by women had the backing of the Equal Opportunities
Commission.
A leading Glasgow lawyer told The Herald that if the challenge was
successful, it could set a precedent in Scots Law for similar challenges
to be made over Labour's selection procedure in Ayr and Stirling.
* A Labour Government would ''swiftly'' implement plans for a Welsh
assembly, Shadow Welsh Secretary Ron Davies pledged yesterday.
Unveiling Labour's detailed proposals for Welsh devolution, Mr Davies
said an assembly would be the focus for a new Welsh sense of identity.
As expected, the planned assembly would have considerably weaker
powers than those proposed by Labour for a devolved Scottish parliament.
It would not be able to raise taxes or pass primary legislation and
there would be no reduction in the number of Welsh MPs at Westminster.

THE Prime Minister's failure to attend the Perth and Kinross
by-election campaign in support of the Conservative candidate was
attacked yesterday by Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who claimed
it was a clear indication that the Tories have privately conceded they
will lose the seat.
Mr Major addressed the Scottish Conservative party conference in
Glasgow last night but did not visit Perth and Kinross, where the Tories
are facing defeat by the SNP on May 25.
Mr Ashdown, who, after SNP leader Alex Salmond and Labour leader Tony
Blair, was the third main party leader to visit the constituency during
the campaign, claimed it was possible that Tory candidate John Godfrey
would poll fewer votes than all of his three main rivals.
This followed the first by-election opinion poll yesterday, which
placed the Tories behind both the SNP and Labour.
He added: ''You need know nothing more about the Tories' perceptions
of their own chances than that Mr Major is prepared to come to Scotland
to speak to a few of his dwindling band of supporters in Glasgow but he
is not prepared to come to the streets of Perth to support the poor man
that he has put up in the firing line to represent his party.''
Mr Ashdown's attack was rejected by a local Tory spokesman, who said
it was standard practice for Prime Ministers not to attend by-election
campaigns.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said he was visiting the
constituency as a volunteer and not a conscript, earlier launched
another bitter attack on the Nationalists, fuelling counter-allegations
by the SNP that the Tories' by-election campaign was among the
''nastiest and tawdriest'' it had ever experienced.
Mr Hurd, who had read local Tory election leaflets linking the SNP to
Nazism, said he would not equate the Nationalists with ''ethnic
cleansing or massacres'' but claimed: ''If the Union was destroyed, all
parts of the Union -- England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland --
would be weakened, and the idea that an independent Scotland . . . would
actually bring advantages to Scotland, compared to the present position,
is just wrong.''
He failed to explain how the rest of the UK would suffer from Scottish
independence, other than to repeat that ''we would all lose because the
Union is greater than the sum of its parts''.
Also during the Tory news conference, the first of four daily
briefings by the main parties contesting the seat, Mr Godfrey said he
did not think a rogue Scottish Conservatory and Unionist candidate in
Perth and Kinross would have any significant impact on the Tories' vote.
''A great number of the electorate would rather have me in their
gardens,'' he joked.
The Foreign Secretary's comments were relayed to the SNP at the second
news conference, at which SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham was asked to
respond to his failure to substantiate the claim that the rest of
Britain would suffer from Scottish independence.
Quoting a recent gaffe by English Conservative MP Richard Ottaway, she
suggested with irony that the rest of the UK would lose ''the most
prosperous region of England''.
Labour, buoyed by the opinion poll, claimed the Tories were no longer
in the race, and that the by-election was now a head-to-head battle
between it and the SNP.
Shadow Social Security Minister Donald Dewar, lending support to
Douglas Alexander, said the SNP had in the past attracted an anti-Tory
vote but claimed that electors could now vote ''as instinct and
principle dictates'', because Labour has a realistic chance of winning,
while the Tories do not.
In the final news conference of the day, Mr Ashdown, who was
supporting Liberal Democrat candidate Veronica Linklater, cautioned
people in Scotland from trusting Labour on the key issue of devolution,
and said that ''on the great issue of constitutional reform, Labour has
all the firmness and consistency of a drunken sailor''.

POLICE in East Lothian are hunting thieves who have stolen a section
of dry ski slope, worth more than #7000.
The theft of a 71sq m section of the nursery slope at the Meadowmill
sports complex, near Tranent, was discovered earlier this week.
The slope, used by about 50 beginners a week, has been lopped by about
a fifth, said Mr Peter Hunt, contract manager for Sport Plus, East
Lothian District Council's leisure management arm.
''Lessons have not been affected as it has been the top section of the
slope that has been taken away. It is not as high as it was but we are
still able to use it.
''I'm not entirely sure who would want to take it away,'' he said.
The section of slope, made up of six-inch hexagonal shapes, described
as grey and white with a metal base, is thought to have been taken
between Sunday and Tuesday afternoon.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said the culprits were
likely to have needed transport to take away the stolen section.
Appealing for witnesses to the theft, the spokesman added: ''It is
difficult to know what alternative use the sections could be put to but
anyone who becomes aware of them or saw anyone behaving unusually on the
slope is asked to contact police.''

<RECORDNO>978419939</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FOUR men who died in the British Trent oil tanker disaster were
unlawfully killed, a coroner ruled yesterday.
They were killed -- along with five other seamen from the tanker -- as
the Korean crude bulk carrier Western Winner collided with their ship
after committing ''virtually every navigational sin in the book'', the
inquest in Poole, Dorset, was told.
A huge hole was gouged in the side of the British Trent, rupturing its
tanks and sending up a fireball of blazing gasoline in the disaster off
the Belgian port of Ostend on June 3, 1993.
East Dorset coroner Nigel Neville-Jones said: ''In my opinion, a
collision between the Western Winner and the British Trent was a
collision which should never have happened had the fundamental rules
regulating the navigation of ships at sea -- particularly in a confined
and busy shipping lane -- been observed.
''As a result, nine innocent crewmen aboard the British Trent lost
their lives.''
Captain Peter Dalby, of the Marine Accident Investigation Board, told
the hearing that the Panamanian-registered Western Winner flouted
numerous marine regulations and was guilty of negligent navigation.
He added: ''I would say that the Western Winner seems to have
committed virtually every navigational sin in the book.''
Captain Dalby, who complained he had no assistance from the Western
Winner's crew during the investigation, said he believed that actions
before the accident amounted to gross negligence.
The inquest was into the deaths of four of the victims: Mr Matthew
Clements, 23, of Bournemouth, Dorset; Mr John Gray, 53, of Sunderland;
Mr Robert Bold, 53, of York; and Mr Adrian Hirst, 25, of Jarrow, Tyne
and Wear.
They all died after inhaling poisonous fumes after they became trapped
in a deadly cloud of gas. The five others killed were from the Irish
Republic.
The coroner, recording his verdict of unlawful killing, said the lack
of action from the Vessel Tracking System -- a body responsible for
keeping track of ships and warning of hazards in the area -- had been
''inexcusable''.
He said: ''The video tape that we watched clearly shows that the
Western Winner was travelling on a collision course.
''Despite this, the VTS did not warn either ship of the exceedingly
dangerous situation that was developing.''
He added that the Western Winner had breached several rules, failing
to keep a lookout despite the foggy conditions and travelling too fast.
He condemned the Belgian authorities and the crew of the Western
Winner for their lack of help in the investigation after the accident.
''I must mention the bravery of the members of the British Trent's
crew,'' he went on. ''They did everything possible to save the ship and
the lives of all aboard.''
A recording of radio messages between the Belgian shipping authorities
and the two ships just minutes before the catastrophe was played at the
inquest.
One was a frantic warning to the Western Winner as it continued on its
collision course, urging its captain: ''You are on the wrong line up, on
the wrong line up.''
However, the captain seemed confused as to his position,
misinterpreted radar signals, and failed to realise that the British
Trent had stopped ahead of him for a pilot to disembark.
''He thought he was three miles from the pilot, when in fact he was
only one mile,'' said Capt Dalby.
When the Western Winner was warned by radio how close it really was
''there was no conversation, only cries of surprise'', he added.

THE Royal British Legion in Scotland is in good heart but must attract
younger members to secure its future, delegates to its annual conference
in Oban were told yesterday.
The legion has 300 branches and around 75,000 members in Scotland but
70% of them are over 55.
National chairman, Mr George Miller of Jedburgh, told nearly 600
delegates in Oban's Corran Halls that a particular worry among smaller
branches was who would take over from the current office bearers once
they had to retire.
''This is a most difficult issue for us to resolve, because the
younger ex-servicemen and women are not there, or not as yet interested
enough to join our ranks,'' he said.
The legion in England had re-vamped and relaunched its image, and the
legion in Scotland was adopting a higher profile through initiatives
such as a mobile promotions unit.
Mr Miller said more had to be done, however, especially to tell the
public about the legion's welfare, pensions, and benefits role.
''Get out there and beat the drum,'' he told delegates: ''Let them
know we are here.''
A spokesman said later that, in the past year, the legion had helped
ex-servicemen and women and their dependants gain around #2m in pensions
and benefits.
Meanwhile, thousands of war veterans will gather in Perth today for
the unveiling of a memorial to the 51st Highland Division, on the North
Inch, by Lieutenant-General Sir Derek Lang.
The memorial, a life-size bronze of a Highland piper being presented
with a posy by a young girl, was sculpted by Mr Alan Herriot of
Edinburgh.
A special plaque bearing a map of Scotland together with the cap
badges of the division have been incorporated alongside the motto, La a
bhlair's math na cairdean -- Friends are good on the day of battle.
The memorial is a replica of one unveiled on October 22, 1994, in the
village of Veghel, Holland, by the British Ambassador to the Hague.
The original pre-war 51st was part of the ill-fated British
Expeditionary Force to France in 1940. Most of its troops were forced to
surrender to the Nazis at St Valery.
The survivors joined the 9th Highland Infantry Division which was
later that year redesignated the 51st Highland.
Commonly known as ''The Highway Decorators'' the 51st HD went on to
fight at El Alamein, North Africa, in Sicily, and on the march to the
Rhine after the D-Day landings.

THREE major business groups have been short-listed to design, build,
and manage the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
The consortia fighting for the lucrative contract, believed to be
worth around #140m, are Consort Healthcare, Laing, and Pentland
Healthcare. Thirty-five groups initially expressed interest in the
contract.
The long-awaited replacement for the Royal Infirmary is scheduled to
open in the year 2000. Work is due to start on the new hospital site at
Little France, on the outskirts of the capital, sometime next year.
Each of the consortia is being allowed to include in its proposals any
plans it may have to take over the old ERI site, which is on prime
development land just off the Meadows.
The project manager of the new ERI, Mr Alan Ezzi, said the consortia
would ''not get any favours'' when it came to the price of taking over
the former ERI site. He made it clear a decision ''further down the
line'' would be made on whether one of the consortia or an outside group
would be allowed to take over the old ERI site.
Despite that assurance, Edinburgh District Council leader Lesley Hinds
said she was concerned over the decision.
The district council had its own plan, to take over the old ERI site
and re-develop it along the lines of a village community scheme, blocked
by health minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie.
Councillor Hinds said: ''We must look at what is happening very
closely. I have not been told officially about the project but it does
initially give us cause for concern.
''We had plans to keep the present Royal Infirmary site in public
ownership. The fact that consortia seem to be allowed to bid for it is
worrying, whether they are allowed to take it over or not.''
The three consortia will work with the trust over the summer on the
design brief for the hospital.
The Laing consortium is made up of John Laing Construction Limited,
The Miller Group, and The British Linen Bank.
Pentland Healthcare is made up of Wimpey Construction Limited, Serco
Services Limited, Impregilo SpA, and the Morrison Construction Group
Limited.
The final bid from Consort Healthcare links up the Royal Bank of
Scotland, BICC plc, and BET plc. BET plc is one of the world's largest
international support service companies and its bid is through its
subsidiary Initial Healthcare Services. BICC's input is through its
construction subsidiary Balfour Beatty.
ERI trust chairman, Professor Cairns Aitken, said: ''This is an
important step in the process of selecting a consortium to allow the
Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS trust to develop a leading teaching
hospital which is in keeping with the long history of medical excellence
in Edinburgh.''

THE nurses' pay dispute escalated last night as the full extent of the
strings attached to offers by Scottish trusts was revealed.
Unions claimed many of the deals meant cuts in holiday, night-shift
and unsocial-hours' allowances, longer working hours, regrading, and
acceptance of local pay bargaining.
The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said the dispute had now gone well
beyond the question of pay to unprecedented attacks on working
conditions and hours.
Mrs Patricia Purton, Scottish director of the RCM said: ''I am afraid
it has become much more serious. I think we could see a great explosion
of anger from our members when they become fully aware of what they are
being asked to concede over the next year.
''Even some of the so-called 'offers without strings' contain changes
which are totally unacceptable or unworkable. It seems as though all the
trusts are working to the same script, with some minor variations.''
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer for Unison, said: ''We have
been inundated with calls from our members, who are absolutely
outraged.''
The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said only two trusts (Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary and North Ayrshire) had made 3% offers without any
strings. It is due to vote on industrial action at its congress in
Harrogate next week.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish RCN secretary, said: ''We are really
disappointed. I would be surprised if there is not an overwhelming rush
of emotion at Harrogate, once nurses have had time to take all this
in.''
One week ago, only a handful of Scottish trusts had made any offer,
compared to more than 100 in England and Wales giving the full 3%
without strings.
On Tuesday, the Scottish NHS chief executive, Mr Geoff Scaife, ordered
all 47 trusts to make offers within 48 hours. Some trust managers argued
against such a hurried response but, by last night, 40 had complied.
The Herald understands the rush to submit offers in Scotland may have
been triggered by Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley in an effort to
avert calls for industrial action at the RCN congress. It is also
believed to have led to some friction between Ministers in London and
Edinburgh.
Repeated requests by The Herald to interview Mr Scaife were turned
down yesterday. The Scottish Office also refused to answer a list of
specific questions on the handling of the dispute, preferring to issue a
general statement instead.
''The level of offers in Scotland has been very much in line with that
in the rest of the UK. Local pay bargaining is Government policy in line
with trust freedoms and the recommendations of the review body. It will
give trusts a measure of control over the largest single element --
about 70% -- of their expenditure,'' it said.

SHERIFF Charles Palmer, who is to try to cycle from Land's End to John
O'Groats to raise cash for the British Heart Foundation, yesterday hit
out at the lack of interest from large firms.
He has already raised more than #15,000 of his #50,000 target before
he starts his trip tomorrow.
However, Sheriff Palmer, 49, who had a triple heart bypass after two
heart attacks in 1991 and 1992 and wants to give something back for his
treatment by the NHS, said: ''I am disappointed with large companies and
the Scottish banks who seem to have very rigid policies in their
approach to individual enterprise in comparison with the response from
individuals.''
The Dunfermline sheriff has already received #2000 from other sheriffs
in Scotland. He is asking every Scots solicitor to donate #5, which
would bring in #45,000 alone, and he is now asking for sponsorship from
judges in England.
''As an example of how individuals respond as opposed to large
companies, apart from my brother sheriffs, Lord Forte has donated #1000
from his personal charitable trust and Richard Branson has put up 2
Virgin Airline tickets from London to New York which will be the star
prize in a raffle the British Heart Foundation will be running after the
cycle run,'' he said.
Sheriff Palmer says he is the only Scots judge ''daft enough'' to
attempt the 1000-mile trip and he has been training on 60-mile plus runs
most weekends.
Several national personalities will be lending their support.
One of them is football legend Graeme Souness, who himself had a
triple heart bypass. He will join Sheriff Palmer with his cycle at
Hawick on May 25.

<HEADLINE>Funding plea for rural rail lines Fears grow for future of Wick/Thurso route</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAVID ROSS, HIGHLAND CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978419944</RECORDNO>

THE Government must be prepared to fund loss-making rural rail lines
if it wants them to stay open, the chairman of the British Railways
Board, Mr John Welsby, said yesterday as concern grew that the route
between Inverness and Wick/Thurso faced an uncertain future.
Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce conference in Aberdeen, he
said: ''Gone is the time when the railways could discharge their social
obligations through cross-subsidisation from commercial activities.''
In business terms, the railways had every incentive to concentrate on
freight where it had great strength.
Railways were also good for commuting in and out of major urban areas
and for fast inter-city journeys. They had roles in providing rural and
cross-country services but these could be sustained only on the basis of
wider economic, social, and political criteria.
''If the judgment of the public authorities is that such services are
required, then the railways will be only too delighted to provide
them,'' he said.
''But the proviso has to be that the authorities also recognise the
extra costs involved and are prepared to fund what cannot be recovered
through the fare-box.''
ScotRail has already indicated it could be looking for other rural
economies in addition to the Fort William sleeper and Motorail service.
The fourth daily service between Wick/Thurso and Inverness, normally
added for the summer, will not come into operation this year. However,
what is causing most anger is that the last train from Inverness has
been brought forward from 6pm to 4.45pm, missing connections from
Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh.
The convener of Caithness District Council, Mr John Young, said:
''People are worried. Lines will survive in the current climate only if
they have sufficient passengers, and they won't get the passengers if
the trains are not at the right times.''
He has asked for a meeting with ScotRail director Mr John Ellis to
discuss the matter.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said last night: ''We have had to make
economies to meet our targets, but everything we are doing is designed
to ensure the continued viability of the line.''
Meanwhile, Mr Walter MacLellan, convener of Cosla's roads and
transportation committee, told a Cosla seminar in Glasgow the effects of
closing the sleeper service on the West Highland Line would spread like
a ''disease'' through the network.
Transport Minister John Watts said in Aberdeen that the Government was
''moving rapidly'' towards privatising the railways.
There was ''considerable interest'' from the private sector, with more
than 160 applications from companies interested in the first eight
franchises.

THE Crown Office in Scotland was yesterday on the receiving end of a
broadside from Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, over its backing for
the American Government's attacks on the Lockerbie film, the Maltese
Double Cross.
Mr Dalyell was scathing in his condemnation, saying: ''Parroting is
the correct word to describe their repetition of these American attacks.
The Crown Office should hang its head in shame.''
The film, shown earlier this week on Channel 4, offers an Iran-Syria
version of the Lockerbie bombing and alleges American complicity and
cover-up. The Crown here and the Americans have indicted two Libyan
agents for the 270 murders.
Mr Dalyell has discussed with Professor Robert Black, the eminent
professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University, the question of what he
alleges amounts to the Crown Office blackening the name of potential
defence witnesses.
''Over the years, they have lectured us on the need to avoid
prejudicing trials. What on earth do they themselves think they are
doing? They are blackening the names of people who might emerge as
defence witnesses. There is an obligation in Scots Law to investigate
and uncover all evidence, including that which might exculpate the
accused. They plainly have not examined the claims put forward in the
film. Instead they have reverted to parroting the Americans' line.''
Mr Dalyell added: ''I am afraid that the Crown Office in Scotland is
doing what Whitehall asks and Whitehall is simply doing what the
Americans ask.''

VETERAN stage and screen star Moira Lister was swindled out of #82,000
by a former solicitor who lavished most of it on his daughter's wedding,
a court heard yesterday.
John Hillman spent #11,000 hiring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for
the reception, and spent most of the rest on a world honeymoon cruise
for the happy couple.
The actress thought she had been backing a legitimate business venture
to buy and refurbish a Scunthorpe snooker hall.
However, Hillman transferred the money into his own account. When Miss
Lister became suspicious and asked for her money back, all she got was a
handful of post-dated cheques which later bounced, Southwark Crown Court
was told.
Hillman, 64, of Sway Road, Lymington, Hampshire, pleaded guilty to
obtaining property by deception. He was given a two-year jail sentence,
suspended for two years.
Judge Geffrey Rivlin, QC, told him his ''carefully organised''
dishonesty deserved a two-year custodial sentence.
The former West End lawyer had not told Miss Lister he had been
suspended from practising as a solicitor for a #10,000 will fraud for
which he was later jailed for nine months.
However, said the judge, the case was ''quite exceptional'' -- the
offence occurred more than nine years ago, Hillman's health was very
poor, and his victim had waited more than six years before complaining
to police.
In those circumstances, ''the proper and just'' course was to suspend
the jail term. Because Hillman was a bankrupt, there was no point in
making a compensation order, the judge added.
Outside court, Miss Lister, star of TV's The Very Merry Widow and Life
Begins at 40 -- who said she was on the ''right side of 70'' -- was
disappointed with the result.
''I would have liked to have seen him put away, although I am
delighted that this nightmare is now over,'' said the actress, from
Eaton Square, Belgravia, central London.
She saw no chance of getting back any of the #82,000.
She explained she had not gone to police before because solicitors
advised her to seek civil redress. However, she had to call off the High
Court action after her money ran out.

LABOUR called yesterday for an investigation into allegations that
high street banks are willing to allow fascists, drug dealers, and
pornographic magazine and chemical weapons producers to open accounts
with them.
Shadow consumer spokesman Nigel Griffiths said the Banking Ombudsman
should look into claims in the latest issue of Maxim magazine.
In an attempt to test banks' ethics, Maxim invented four bogus
companies -- a racist political party, a pornographic magazine, a
magazine for drug dealers, and a chemical weapons manufacturer -- and
asked the four big banks if they would be willing to open accounts.
Maxim claims Nat West had ''no ethical worries'' about accepting cash
from The White British Party -- which had a clenched fist symbol on its
notepaper. Barclays took a ''similarly libertarian'' approach, says
Maxim.
A Nat West adviser was ''charm itself'' once he realised that there
was nothing illegal about Young &amp; Shaven magazine. Barclays also said
there would be ''no problem'' and offered a free advice pack on setting
up a company.
Lloyds was ''incredibly effusive and helpful'' about ''Pipe + Rocks''
-- ''a magazine for the hard-core drug dealer''. Midland was amused --
but agreed to take a deposit. Nat West again said it had ''no ethical
objections''.
Barclays raised ''not a murmur'' about accepting money from
''NapalmInc''. Nat West again had ''no problem'' and Lloyds was
concerned only about the ''Inc'' part of the name because it was an
American shortform, added a report in Maxim.
Mr Griffiths said the report was disturbing.
''It raises questions about the kind of organisations these banks are
already dealing with,'' he said.
''I and many others are horrified by banks' treatment of many
thousands of small legitimate businesses in this country, who are
struggling to keep their heads above water in spite of the pressure they
are under from banks.
''In the light of that, it's distressing to read that banks appear to
be willing to deal with such organisations as racist parties.''
He added: ''The Banking Ombudsman should investigate the report and,
if it proves to be true, lay down some firm guidelines.''
The Midland said it had opened no accounts and had no record that any
discussions ever took place.
A spokesman said all new accounts were subject to ''rigorous checks''
and the bank would not knowingly conduct business with an organisation
involved in illegal activity.
Lloyds said it would not have allowed any of the groups to open
accounts.
A spokeswoman said staff were encouraged to be ''welcoming'' to all
customers and not to make snap judgments.
She said Maxim would not tell the bank which branches its reporters
had approached.
Barclays also stressed it was unlikely that any of the accounts would
have been passed -- and added that Maxim refused to give details of
branches.
A spokesman said that, in principle, the bank would not differentiate
between any political party.
However, any suggestions of illegal activity would be investigated
very quickly.
Nat West said it had no evidence of the discussions taking place.
A spokesman said the bank would never knowingly collude with illegal
activity. It had a code of conduct to which staff should adhere.

THE British-born American Ambassador to France, Mrs Pamela Harriman,
has sold three Impressionist paintings at Christie's in New York for a
total of #11.7m, rivalling the sum made by her son, Mr Winston Churchill
MP, from the sale of the Churchill papers. Picasso's Mere et Enfant of
1922 made #7.5m, Renoir's Portrait de Mademoiselle Demarsy made #3.5m,
and Le Chapeau Bleu by Matisse, painted in 1944, went for #711,000.

A BABY with a serious strain of meningitis has been admitted to
Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary, the hospital's NHS trust said last
night. The 18-month-old boy, Grant Leadbetter, is doing well and doctors
said there was no cause for concern.
People who have been in close contact with Grant are being screened. A
statement said that the boy's parents, who live in Slamannan, had
reported their son was responding to treatment.

A MEDICAL ward at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has been closed to
admissions after five patients were found to be carrying a strain of the
bacterium Klebsiella, which is resistant to many antibiotics.
The main symptom is an upset stomach and the patients affected are
said to have minimal symptoms and do not require treatment.
A hospital spokesman said: ''Many people carry strains of Klebsiella
in their bodies all the time without any harmful effects. However, if
Klebsiella, and in particular antibiotic-resistant strains, are
transmitted to susceptible patients such as those with underlying
disease and whose defences against infection are impaired, the organism
could cause serious illness.
''Given these considerations, as a precautionary measure to prevent
the spread of this strain of Klebsiella, it has been decided to close
the affected ward to new admissions until the problem has been resolved.
Strict hygiene procedures are in force.''
A Grampian Health Board spokesman said there was no public health
risk.

THE eyes of 10 Italian former prisoners of war welled with tears
yesterday as they stepped through the door of the chapel which is known
as the Miracle of Camp 60.
At the end of the Second World War, they had left Orkney and the tiny
church they built out of two Nissen huts, little thinking that it would
survive for half a century.
They were overcome with emotion as they saw that the chapel is still
lovingly cared for as a symbol of a faith that had flourished in
adversity.
Ten former PoWs once held captive at Camp 60 had made a return journey
to the islands to mark the 50th anniversary of the completion of another
remarkable construction project.
Around 1000 Italians were involved in the building of the Churchill
Barriers, causeways linking four isles to Orkney's main island,
Mainland.
They were built to seal the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow on the
direct orders of Winston Churchill, after a German U-boat crept into the
great natural harbour and sank HMS Royal Oak with the loss of 833 men as
she lay at anchor.
The job took the construction company Balfour Beatty four years and
involved a workforce drawn from Orkney and the rest of Britain as well
as the PoWs.
Mr Gino Caprara, now 75, said yesterday he and his fellow PoWs had
been reluctant at first to work on a military project.
However, he was delighted that the barriers have brought great
civilian benefits to Orkney, serving as a roadway linking five islands.
Mr Caprara was deeply moved as he surveyed the carefully-preserved
interior of the chapel, constructed out of the most basic of raw
materials but regarded as an artistic masterpiece.
''We felt such a strong need for somewhere to worship,'' he said.
''We never thought that the chapel would survive for long after we
went home to Italy.
''Fifty years is a long time and today, as I walked in through the
door, I felt a shiver run down my spine.
''So many memories come flooding back. Most of all, I remember all the
missing friends who can't be here today.''

SYDNEY: Australia's Trade Practice's Commission yesterday approved a
route-sharing agreement between Quantas and British Airways on the
condition that they limit the air fare price rises for three years. The
commission's clearance of the agreement was regarded as one key to a
successful float of Qantas in the middle of this year, because of the
cost efficiencies it represents.

OK, escape to a desert island sounds nice, but if it's anonymity
you're after, forget it. The smaller the island, the more timeworn and
couthy the islanders and strange their traditions, the greater the
interest the world takes in your affairs. It has been very much like
that on Papa Westray of late.
In the past few months the Songs of Praise TV team, skippered by Pam
Rhodes, were traipsing around the place. We've featured on Radio
Scotland's The Slice, when Maggie o' Midhouse's vintage tractor clanked
to stardom. And on a local radio travelogue, Alastair o' Cott talked a
lot of sense about the problems of keeping young people from drifting
away from the island.
Should you happen to have ''journo/dropped out'' stamped across yer
broo, then a contemplative retreat from the cares of the world is merely
a fancy: you become a source of wonderment, on a par with the
disappearing cornflakes or, as I remember Jimmie Macgregor putting it:
''And now we meet Glasgow journalist Jim Hewitson actually living
here.''
And I'm certain that it was my decision to dwell on Papa Westray which
led to my -- so far less than sparkling -- career in broadcasting. Over
the next few weeks, a BBC Radio Orkney extravanganza will be winding
down for the summer. The fact that I'm still part of the team is, to say
the least, surprising.
You see, in an early contribution to the Bruck programme, a sort of
swap-shop of the airwaves where everything from tractor gearboxes to
hydro poles change hands, I used a four-letter word.
My telephone presence on this rather splendid improvised show in which
almost anything goes from poaching salmon on the production desk to
rubbing down the station's female presenter with exotic oils, is to
justify the woolly title of Sage of Papay.
I'm called on to produce snippets -- bizarre yet relevant -- from
world history (a lot of scope there) and to make sensisble comment on
everything from witch-pricking to the efficacy of emu oil. Simple enough
concept, I suppose, if lateral thinking is your bag.
Why, oh why, then did I decide to overdo it and include a limerick of
a rather doubtful flavour, just to emphasise a point. At the time, I
believed it had been done in the best possible taste, was appropriate,
agricultural, and inoffensive.
Presenters Dave ''Metallic'' Gray and John ''I'm the Boss'' Fergusson,
senior producer and tea boy, had organised another outlandish theme for
the early evening programme.
They wanted to find the best ham roll in Kirkwall and had dragooned
the senior domestic science teacher and the chairman of the Chamber of
Commerce, no less, to make a roll-by-roll assessment, taking specimens
from five different establishments, dissecting them and evaluating the
contents -- tomatoes for juiciness, butter for thickness, meat for
tenderness. Didn't I tell you . . . weird.
Anyway, forewarned and anxious to be as topical as possible, I dug out
a few pieces of obscure info indexed and cross-referred under
Scots/swine/ham rolls from my dusty library (did you know that Glasgow
used to be Britain's ham-curing capital?) and sat by the phone, awaiting
my live contribution.
''Now up with the satellite disc and over to paradise isle where once
again Jim Hewitson waits to astonish us!'' announces John. Isn't
showbusiness exciting? There is really no point skipping around this, it
was out before I knew it, as the lassie said to the sojer. The limerick
which I'd unearthed and which, I hope you'll agree was right in concept,
runs as follows:
I'm glad pigs can't fly, said young Sellers
(He's one of those worrying fellers).
For if they could fly,
They'd shit in the sky,
And we'd all have to carry umbrellas.
This show is live, free-form, play-it-as-you-go radio, but three
stunned, speechless seconds can sound like a wee eternity. ''I think we
should maybe move on to some music while I look out my P45,'' says John,
solemnly. Unabashed, I finished my piece and signed off, pretty sure
that by the week's end the red card, the jotters, would be arriving in
the post from the Beeb. Instead, the first communication contained the
usual modest cheque.
The four-letter word controversy was a bit of a talking point on the
island for days afterwards. Papay listening figures the following week,
according to normally reliable sources, doubled from five to 10.
However, I've been tipped the wink, shown the yellow card as it were,
and shall not transgress again.
Mind you . . . discussing European connections with our Orcadian
saints a week or two later, I casually made mention of the enterprise of
some German burghers. An innocent mistake. Honest.

WAYS AND MEANS
Bruce Sandison is reminded that while walking may be the most natural
of all leisure activities, it can become an urgent necessity
HILL WALKING is a serious business. Multi-million pound serious. A
glance in the window of any outfitter will confirm this. We are talking
mega-bucks here; a world-wide industry engaging the expertise of
thousands of people -- bankers, scientists, medics, dieticians,
technocrats, cartographers, marketing specialists, public relations
wizards, outdoor gurus, the men who cobble the boots and stud their
soles.
And yet walking is one of the most natural and necessary of all human
activities: the need to travel from point A to point B by putting one
foot in front of the other to reach the desired objective -- without
getting lost. I was reminded of this simple fact while watching a recent
Network First television programme: Escape from Tibet.
The programme followed a small group of Tibetans, from Lhasa, the
capital of Tibet, as they escaped to freedom from Chinese oppression
over some of the most unforgiving country on planet Earth. The youngest
was 11 years old and the party tramped across Himalayan snowfields and a
19,000ft pass attired as though out for a Sunday stroll down Sauchiehall
Street.
I swear one was wearing jeans and trainers. Of Gore-Tex, crampons,
ice-axe, compass and map, torch and whistle, there was none. At least,
none that I could see. Nor could I see the crew which ''sneaked in'' to
record their 1600-mile journey. That galled me: human beings fighting
for survival displayed for armchair-snug viewer pleasure. The group
should have been airlifted to safety -- but then, of course, there would
have been no programme, no drama.
''Objective'' is the key word. The Tibetans walked because they had no
alternative. Their journey was a compelling, urgent passage. We walk
because it gives us pleasure -- and because we can afford Western
hi-tech luxuries which make our expeditions more bearable. We are
ambulatory dilettantes. They are a hill-hardened race where walking is
the way of life.
People forget how to walk. I spent two seasons in Chilean Patagonia
largely in the company of ultra-rich Americans, most of whom were
over-loud, overweight and over-confident. A 10-minute walk across a flat
meadow gave them problems. They would stop at fallen tree trunks,
concern creasing their faces, before gingerly crossing, stubby arms held
sideways for balance.
One pair who claimed hill walking experience had completed a 10-day
trek in New Zealand the previous summer: three morning miles, lunch in a
good restaurant, three afternoon miles, then five-star overnight
accommodation in a suitable hotel. ''Hey, Bruce, have a look. This is
the medal and certificate I got for finishing the course. That was some
damned hike, I can tell you.''
But there are people in Scotland for whom walking is still second
nature, and I was reminded of this on the lower slopes of Carn Ghluasaid
(3140ft) above Loch Cluanie in the Ceannacroc Forest between Glen Shiel
and Glen Moriston. Two shepherds and four dogs were working sheep down
the hill. Men and animals in perfect harmony, with each other and with
their environment.
Our objective that morning was Sgurr nan Conbhairean (3642ft) and its
attendant peak, Sail Chaorainn (3287ft). The day was full of white mist
and driving rain and the trudge to the cairn overlooking the sheer north
face of Carn Ghluasaid was a long, tiresome, wet slog. Once there, Ann
and I huddled in the shelter of the stones wondering whether to go on or
abort.
We decided to take it stage by stage: Creag a' Chaorainn (3278ft),
Glas Bealach, Sgurr nan Conbhairean, Sail Chaorainn, depending upon the
weather. We mist-leap-frogged west. There are few problems provided you
keep back from the north face and the precipitous drop into Allt Coire
Sgreumh glen. Safe rather than sorry, we tumbled into the welcome
protection of the fine summit shelter on Sgurr na Conbhairean.
The return journey, by the ridge above Gorm Lochan and down to Meall
Bfeac (2133ft), was completed in warm sunlight surrounded by a vista of
jagged peaks clad with bright green slopes. We drank from the clear
water of Coire Lair and tramped in good order along General Wade's old
Military Road to the car at Lundie -- with, thankfully, not a single
Chinese oppressor in sight.

The end, Joe Donnelly warns fellow scribes, is nigh as machines
prepare to take the words out of our mouths and the thinking out of our
skills basket
THIS may come as something of a shock to all those of us who have
earned a crust by the skilful use of a keyboard. Fingers are facing
redundancy. Journalists, secretaries, playwrights, authors, a whole
segment of society who have evolved to let our fingers do the talking,
are set to see a skill extinguished.
In the space of a brief century, a mere blink of an eye on the
evolutionary clock, since the invention of the first mechanical writing
device and with the introduction of the odd, incomprehensibly arranged
QWERTY keymap lexicon, our likes have come and are now going. Our
services rendered, we are facing extinction.
We may not have been geniuses; our literary abilities might have been
limited, but we made up for our lack by impressive and dextrous
prestidigitation.
We could type like the clappers.
It made us consequently garrulous and wordy, running off at the
fingers, so to speak. Some of us could write faster than we could think,
especially sportswriters, most of the time. The more words, the more pay
and the clatter of typewriters, to our ears, sounded uncannily like the
press that printed the fivers at the Royal Mint.
Computers came along and we coped with the change, though we cricked
our necks trying to see what was on the screen while our fingers
chattered. The keyboard was still the same, if oddly silent and made of
plastic, but QWERTY lived on and we could handle it.
Until now.
Recently, upon the desk, landed an invitation to a new technology
seminar and this writer recognises the death knell, the beginning of the
end, a slow slide to oblivion. Strathclyde University was hosting an
event at which IBM demonstrated its latest threat to us typing types . .
. Voice Type Dictation.
This is a speech recognition system that is set to kill off the need
to finger a keyboard at all. For the moment, Strathclyde's recent
seminar was aimed at lawyers. IBM's Voice Type Dictation, it is claimed,
will enable the legal fraternity to produce high-quality finished
reports minutes after the legal eagle has finished dictation. This,
scribes, is clearly the beginning of the end.
The system analyses spoken words and turns them into script on the
screen. It will even distinguish between homophones like too, to, and
two too.
As in ''That's the 2.02 choo choo to Rhu, too.''
Our lawyer, having sacked his now useless secretary, will be able to
sit at the screen, spitting words out like a hair-triggered Uzi with
hardly a pause for breath. The machine will take care of all the
difficult terms, like avizandum and interlocutor, and heretofore and
thereafter.
It will make sense of, as no laymen can possibly do, those parties of
the first part and the parts relating, inter alia, to other parties
altogether. All the lawyer will have to do is sign his name just below
the really important part . . . where the thinking machine has made its
threats of damages or its claim for compensation.
The computer, using voice recognition and understanding the most basic
principles of the law -- get the money first -- will automatically
charge the client 50 notes while the junior partner of Leeglade,
Snatchitt and Billem, charges his way to yet another nice little earner.
That's just one of the nightmare options that a decade or so back
would have been described as a 1984 scenario. Remember the good old days
of 1984!
Secretaries will be the first to go. Brothers and sisters, scribblers
all, it's us next. For where will it stop? Can it stop? Today it's the
typing fraternity. Tomorrow it's the wordsmiths.
As technology relentlessly advances, the thinking machines will do
more than take the words from our mouths. They will take the bread too,
when they start to create their own words.
Give them a thesaurus and they'll never split an infinitive or end a
sentence with a preposition. Like us, they will make it up as they go
along, but tirelessly, and for less. And then things will develop to the
stage when they no longer have to listen to us, but will tune in only to
each other, cutting out the middle man forever, and then it's curtains
for us.
The above was where this writer's head slumped, in despair, on the
keyboard. The vision of the future was so oppressive it caw'd the feet
for a dizzy moment.
Imagine a machine-age chip-driven Kelman (or do we have one already)
where the processor decides to cut down on repetition and reduces How
Flamin' Late it Bleedin' Was How Damned Late to its expletive deleted
basic. Imagine a logic-oriented Lochhead deciding gender was pointless.
See people? See persons?
Imagine a motherboard switching to diatribe/rant mode with a side-bar
of nationalist flavour and an added intolerance weighting. Could get a
regular slot in The Herald, I shouldn't wonder, as Apple Mac-Loud.
Or RAM Shields (is that a pun or what?) Diary, where the fun is all in
the binary digits?
Curtains indeed for us writing types. The machines would earn #500,000
advances for incomprehensible novels and they would never need to visit
a dentist. They will produce works of literary genius, tales of
parliamentary intrigue, and never seek a seat in the House of Lords or
the chairmanship of the Conservative Party, or need to discuss share
prices. They would have no prophets to blaspheme and therefore no Fatwa
to risk.
Their novels, flashed through the Internet, would bear titles like
High Density; The Fall of ROM, Terminal II.
As they overtake us, and take the thinking out of our skills basket,
we could find ourselves relegated to huddling around the campfires at
the mouths of caves watching the lights in the distance where the
machines whirr and click and talk among themselves.
We would be once more relegated to passing on tales, by word of mouth,
of the golden days of legend when men were as Gods.
''In the beginning was the Word,'' our children might say. ''And it
was processed.''
Secretaries will be the first to go. Brothers and sisters, scribblers
all, it's us next. For where will it stop?

SCOTTISH secondary school teachers are suffering at the hands of a
growing number of obstructive and abusive parents, it was claimed
yesterday.
Parental disdain was making it much more difficult for teachers to
tackle unauthorised absence from school and pupil indiscipline, the
president of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association told the
union's annual conference in Aviemore yesterday.
Ms Marie Allan, who is also assistant principal teacher of English at
Holy Rood High in Edinburgh, said she was ''fed up'' with parental
attitudes which ranged from apathy to a ''downright obstructionist and
abusive response''.
In a powerful speech about the challenges facing teachers seeking to
secure support from the home, Ms Allan emphasised that the vast majority
of parents were deeply committed to their children's education, and gave
schools their full co-operation.
However, nor were teachers blameless. Just like parents, a small
minority of teachers were failing in their duties, said Ms Allan,
confirming that she was not espousing the ''blinkered, protectionist
philosophy'' championed by those who categorised people not in the
teaching profession as ''inevitably 'agin' it''.
However, she went on: ''Over the last few years, I have become
increasingly concerned about how much more difficult my job has been
made on occasions, occasions which are now more frequent, by parental
attitudes to myself and my colleagues.''
There were many instances of parental disdain. Some parents refused to
provide absence notes because they believed it was enough for their
child to say he or she was ill.
Others colluded in condoned absence for such trivial matters as
helping to choose a wedding outfit, said Ms Allan, echoing in both
instances recent Scottish Office concerns about high levels of
unauthorised absence in the secondary sector.
She wondered how many of her colleagues had seen the uncomprehending
looks from parents advised by schools that during term was not the best
time to take their children off school for two weeks' holiday -- even if
they were not sitting exams -- and no matter how cheap their deal was.
There were also parents who teachers would hesitate to contact because
their only response to complaints from the school about their child's
bad behaviour, would be to hit him or her.
Action by schools could also be counter-productive because parents
refused to co-operate with sanctions imposed for indiscipline or,
indeed, impose their own rules.
Ms Allan asked if teachers were to blame because they had failed those
parents when they were at school.
But that was not the answer, even though it seemed that teachers were
now supposed to teach on all aspects of living, from sex, drugs, and
Aids, to smoking, equal opportunities, contraception, and parenting.
Taking a caustic swipe at the notion that all these issues and more
were in the teachers' domain, she declared: ''I sometimes think it would
be better to scrap the curriculum as we know it and just go for personal
and social development, including parenting skills, and then we might
satisfy the ever-growing demands and solve the problem of parental
co-operation.
''We would at least be able to show that going for the easy option of
giving in to a child's every demand, exhibiting a materialistic, selfish
approach, respecting no-one, are not the best ways for society to
function.''

IT was time to pack away the swimsuits and get the winter woollies out
again yesterday as blizzards swept across Scotland just days after the
country had sweltered in the sunshine.
The early-morning snowfall made driving conditions difficult and there
were many minor accidents. The most sought after motoring accessory
suddenly became a set of snow tyres instead of a sunroof.
Just a few days ago, parts of Scotland were enjoying temperatures in
the 70s F. But the sun worshippers who rashly decided that summer had
arrived were yesterday given cause to reflect on the wisdom of the old
saying: Ne'er cast a cloot 'til may is oot.
If they had not been so busy shivering, they might have reflected long
enough to realise that, strictly speaking, the phrase refers not to the
month but to may-blossom, the hawthorn flower. However, it was too cold
for such hair-splitting.
The maximum temperature in some places yesterday was as low as 48 F.
Heavy falls of snow early in the morning caused chaos for drivers in
many areas.
Mrs Elaine Berry, the Automobile Association's roadwatch co-ordinator
for Scotland, said: ''A combination of usual rush-hour traffic and
blizzard conditions caused problems throughout Scotland.
''Worst affected areas were Strathclyde, West Lothian, and Grampian.
As the spate of minor accidents shows, drivers must slow down to deal
with Scotland's rapidly changing weather conditions.''
With wet roads and frost forecast overnight, she advised drivers to
allow extra time for their journeys, keep their speed down, and keep a
safe distance from the car in front.
In Strathclyde, the regional council's roads department had 11
snow-clearing vehicles out tackling routes which had as much as three
inches of snow in places like Harthill.
A spokesman said: ''The snowfall was very sudden but it had been
forecast and our crews were standing by.''
The gritters and snowploughs were also out in Lothian and in Grampian.
Roads badly affected in the morning included: the M8 at Harthill; all
roads in West Lothian, especially around Blackburn, West Calder, and
Livingston; the M74 at Lesmahagow and Douglas; the M73 at Baillieston;
the A72 through Lanark; and all roads north of Aberdeen, particularly
around Keith and Fochabers.
The bad news is that the cold weather is expected to continue for a
couple of days, with snow and sleet on higher ground. The only
consolation is that the snowfalls will not be as heavy as yesterday.
The really good news is that midsummer is less than six weeks away.
You never know, by then it might only be raining . . .

A LEADING private Roman Catholic school is to merge with Glasgow's
only private primary school in an attempt to meet the growing demand for
independent Catholic education in Scotland.
St Aloysius College in the centre of Glasgow, will merge with St
Francis primary on the South Side of the city at the start of the next
school term. The college is to expand its curriculum and hopes to
attract more fee-paying pupils from around Scotland.
The college's headteacher, Father James Hanvey, yesterday said the
move would consolidate the Catholic presence in the independent sector
and meet a growing demand for private education from Catholic families.
There are 75 independent schools in Scotland but only a handful of
Catholic secondary schools. Fort Augustus Abbey School closed last year.
After the merger, St Aloysius will be able to offer a Catholic
education from kindergarten to age 18. All of St Francis's 80
kindergarten and primary one to three pupils will automatically move to
the college without having to take an entrance exam.
Father Hanvey said the merger had been in the pipeline for a number of
years but had been been finalised only at the beginning of this year. He
added that both schools shared the same ethos, mission, and academic
record.
''The merger with St Francis gives children the unique opportunity of
experiencing this social, spiritual, and intellectual tradition from an
early age,'' he said.
St Francis, in Newlands, has been one of St Aloysius's feeder schools.
Its headteacher Josephine McGreal said her small staff and parents were
delighted with the amalgamation. She said it was hoped that the move
would attract more pupils and added that St Francis's fees, currently
#2684 a year, would not increase significantly as a result of the
amalgamation.
''The merger enables us to expand the curriculum to include science, a
modern language, and music.''
The move comes at a time when the number of pupils attending Glasgow's
100 Catholic primary schools has been falling in line with a general
demographic decrease in Scotland.
However, the increase in the demand for private Catholic education
reflects a broader nation-wide trend. According to Rose Bell, director
of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools, there has been a
relative rise in the number of parents keen to enrol children in the
independent school sector over the past decade.
Father Hanvey said that although Cardinal Thomas Winning had in the
past expressed reservation about independent education, St Aloysius had
always enjoyed his support with the school teaching its pupils high
moral values.

Craft-bakers are producing speciality products to combat the price
war, as Catherine Brown reports
THE cheapest wrapped white loaf in my local supermarket has just hit a
price-saver 24 pence. If I shop around, so I'm told, I can get one for a
rock-bottom 19p. Tempting prices. But also a battlefield which has seen
the almost total destruction of craft bakers. Out of the total baking
industry, craft-bakers now amount to just 8% while plant bakers take an
80% share and in-store supermarkets 12%.
The highly mechanised bakeries which make plant bread have just
increased the recommended price to retailers of their 800g white loaf
from 75p to 79p, but it has made little difference in the price-cutting
bread war which has been raging since discount stores took the price
down to about 20p.
According to Jim McPhie, president of the Scottish Association of
Master Bakers, most craft bakers have more or less given up on the 800g
loaf. He is delighted, however, with consumers' current enthusiasm for
speciality breads.
''This is the kind of bread which the craft-baking sector does well,''
he says. ''To get bread with flavour requires long, slow fermentation,
which releases flavours into the dough. It also requires high-protein
wheat, preferably Canadian, which is more expensive than low-protein
British wheat used by plant bakers.''
The craft bakers start their bread-making process with flour, yeast,
and water, fermenting what they call a ''sponge'' dough for a day before
the bread is made. Then some of the sponge is mixed with the dough
ingredients using about 5kg of flour per batch. It is then mixed with
water and kneaded in a spiral mixer, allowed to rest, shaped, and proved
for about an hour before baking.
It is a labour-intensive operation on a small scale with an end
product which tastes and smells of yeast baking. Yet the craft bakers
who make this bread have never really made much effort to promote it as
traditional fermented bread worth a premium price.
Some distinction ought to be made between this bread and the in-store
supermarket bread, which may look as though it is a traditionally
fermented loaf -- charged at a premium price -- but which is actually
made with the plant method, and tastes accordingly.
The 800g plant loaf has been perfected over the years using a method
described as the Chorleywood Baking Process (CBP), says Ewan Bennet,
production executive for British Bakeries.
To make a plant loaf, about 200kg of flour is mixed with 10kg
''improver'' (including ascorbic acid and yeast foods), plus baker's
yeast, salt, and water. Everything is mixed vigorously at high speed to
replace the process of kneading and fermenting the dough.
The bread is then left to rise for about 50 minutes and baked for
20-25 minutes at 260-290 degrees Celcius. When it comes hot out of the
tin, it goes into an air-conditioned cooler for about two hours to
maximise the water absorption before it is sliced and wrapped.
The result is a loaf with a moisture content of about 40% which has a
soft, springy, even crumb, and a shelf life of about four days. A French
stick has a water content of 30% and lasts less than 24 hours. Though
made in America, no other country in Europe makes this high-water,
low-taste loaf with a soft crumb.
The other bread production system is in-store supermarket bakeries.
But enticing baking smells may not always mean that the loaf has been
started in the ''bakery'' from scratch.
Fermented craft-baked bread is not synonymous with supermarkets, and
plant bakery employees will admit, off the record, that it is often the
cheaper, plant-type dough which has been frozen or three-quarters baked
which supermarkets use in their bakeries. A method using plant bread
dough described as Cool-Core is being experimented with at the moment.
At Safeway there are 300 in-store bakeries where the CBP was
originally used with high-speed mixers, says Ray Jenkins, head of Bakery
Retail. Now the bakeries are moving over to what he describes as an
Activated Dough Development (ADD) method which still uses the improvers
and emulsifiers for volume and shelf life, but instead of high-speed
mixers it uses the traditional spiral-mixer, mixing for about nine
minutes instead of three for the CBP.
''Going back to the more traditional method,'' he says, ''produces a
better flavoured and a better textured loaf, and we are now replacing
high-speed mixers with spiral mixers in all new stores. We do not
bake-off any pre-prepared plant bread.''
Tesco admits to making its in-store bread with all three methods: the
ADD method, the CBP, and also with a traditionally fermented dough.
Sainsbury, on the other hand, did not want to discuss its methods of
in-store baking, regarding it as commercially sensitive information.

I ARRIVED just at the wrong moment in Apulia, in the town of San
Severo, a centre of wine-making in that region's hill-girt plain. As we
drove down the road from Foggia, we heard on the radio about a case that
had come before the commissars of Brussels. For once, they got things
right, and condemned an Italian producer whose wine turned out to have
no contact with the grape at all but to be a concoction of alcohol and
blackcurrant juice, or something, and it had come from Apulia.
Most Italians guffawed, but it was hardly a joke for the local
vintners, who could see their markets vanishing. Truly this was no time
to be visiting them, and my attempts at quips about a little Euro-mishap
were very frostily received.
That probably marked the nadir of Italian wine's reputation,
threatening to tar the whole lot with the brush of unreliable plonk. But
that was back in the spring of 1986, and a good deal has happened since.
Of course, many native growers and drinkers carry on as they always have
done, making and guzzling the stuff in blissful ignorance of, or in
sublime indifferent to, whatever may be thought by those unfortunate
enough not to have been born Italian. ''Bianco o rosso?'' they ask the
pale northerner, and expect him to be as easily satisfied as they are.
Some foreigners, notably Australians, have moved in to take advantage
of the indifference, to buy up traditional vineyards and apply their own
techniques to the production. The result is much as you would expect;
Australian wine from Italian soil. But other Italians have pulled up
their socks, or rather have become still more exacting in their previous
high standards, and even found the Euro-measures of quality helpful in
defining the difference between their own and lesser wines.
So I was interested when Ian Cumming at Whighams of Ayr invited me to
taste a few examples of this new wine from what I might otherwise have
dismissed as bottles far too old and ordinary. ''Valpolicella, not for
the cellar'', says the adage, but that was hardly true of the 1992 he
offered me from Roccolo di Mizzole, to the north of Verona, made by
Cecilia Beretta. For the price, #6.93, this was an exceptionally rich
and deep wine, in its colour, in its fruity nose, and in its taste, with
the year it had spent in oaken casks well in evidence and with slight
fungal touches besides. It is fine now, but will also keep. To prove the
point about longevity, and to show that in this case the quality was
nothing recent, I was also allowed to sample a 1985 Amarone, darker and
fuller yet, but still maturing all the same, and well worth its price of
#13.51.
Turning to Signora Beretta's whites, we tried a 1993 Soave Classico,
grown on the same range of hill but further to the east, at Terre di
Brognoligo. At #6.29, this was an excellent example of the genre,
tingling dry and clean, but again full of fruit, of almonds with a hint
of gooseberry. A Pinot Grigio 1994 was developing much of the same
style, and at #5.76 represented even more of a bargain.
It was time to venture away from these earnest, hard-working
northerners and try our luck in the south. The further in that direction
you go in Italy, the greater the scams are likely to be. But you are
safe enough to linger in Tuscany, where Whighams has long bought from
the exacting Principessa Pignatelli, who personally supervises every
stage of her wine-making at Castell 'in Villa. She produces Chianti
Classico, another wine which has not altogether benefited from its
familiarity, nor from its association with wickerwork baskets and
candles.
Here you could understand what an injustice has been done to some of
these good old-time Italian vintners. We tasted a Reserva from 1983,
priced at #9.99, still rather restrained and dignified wine, yet with a
good deal of vitality underneath. We went on to a 1987, considerably
cheaper at #7.15, which can certainly be drunk now but which is also
likely to improve. A 1991 at #8.15 was a little young for my taste,
though evidently gathering its forces to develop into a powerful wine.
Considering how exuberant the Sangiovese grape can be, this series was a
tribute to its versatility.

Professor Jim Hewit of Dundee University's Department of Applied
Physics, Electronics and Mechanical Engineering, reports on robotronics
UNTIL a few years ago, industrial robots (as distinct from Daleks and
other sci-fi creations) would be found doing only the most boring and
repetitive jobs such as pick-and-place, spot-welding, and
paint-spraying.
Now, with advances in the technology of sensing and the availability
of cheap powerful microcomputers, robots can be given enough
intelligence to work in much more interesting and challenging jobs.
In Australia, for example, there are sheep-shearing robots able to
remove fleece faster than even the best human shearer, and the sheep
like it better since there is less chance of losing an ear!
Several countries, including the UK, are designing robots for milking
cows. The most difficult part is to recognise where the teats are on the
udder, but if that can be solved then cows can be milked when they want
rather than having to wait for the farmer.
Japan has introduced the robot guide dog for the blind. This machine
can take its master around an unfamiliar route using signals beamed out
from a network of transmitters like the ones used in mobile phones.
Here at Dundee University we are designing robot systems to assist
surgeons when they perform operations. Ninewells Hospital is the home of
some of the world's best endoscopic, or ''keyhole'', surgeons, but when
a surgeon is doing a keyhole operation, a second surgeon is needed to
hold and move the endoscope -- the long thin telescopic camera that is
poked through into the patient's body to send back the pictures so that
the first surgeon can see what he is doing. We are aiming to replace the
second surgeon by a robot, with the operating surgeon telling the robot
how to move the camera by means of voice commands.
Designing a robot for this application is quite a problem since the
first concern must be for the patient's safety and the system must be
completely fail-safe. It must be able to recognise the surgeon's voice
and not respond to words spoken by other people in the theatre, and it
must be intelligent enough to recognise if it is being asked to do
something dangerous and query the surgeon about it.
That is a far cry from welding bits of cars together.

Brussels
A DRIVING licence designed like a credit card and recognised in all 15
European Union member states was proposed yesterday by the European
Commission.
The idea will cause controversy in Britain, where there is a debate
inside the Conservative Party about making identity cards compulsory.
However, the Commission, emphasising that the ''credit card'' licence
would not infringe civil liberties, insisted that the card would be
optional and should not be seen as an official identity card.
Prototype designs show each member state's initial in a blue rectangle
encircled by yellow stars -- the EU's logo -- with space for a picture
of the licence holder.
The licence would be available from July next year and would give
standardised information about the category of vehicle the holder was
permitted to drive, along with details already required by licensing
authorities.
The information would appear in any of the EU's 11 official languages
or in bi-lingual form, which means that Scottish drivers could have
their licences in English and Gaelic or another minority language.
The Commission said that in future it could be possible to incorporate
a microchip to make the licence a so-called ''smart card'' on which
various kinds of information could be stored.
''However, there is no question of incorporating such advances in
information technology without drafting new community legislation in
which not only technical aspects but also protection of individual
privacy would need to be addressed,'' the Commission added.
''There is no infringement, potential or otherwise, of civil
liberties. The new driving licences are entirely optional and may not
replace or double up as an official identity card. It is up to any
person and/or organisation to decide if they want to consider the
licence as a source of information for personal identification.''
It is now almost 10 years since a Community model paper driving
licence was designed. Four years ago, it was adapted to take account of
harmonising vehicle categories and to carry a photograph of the holder,
a move initiated by Britain.
National licences issued from July next year must comply with this
revised model. Existing licences will be valid until they expire.
If a proposed directive is adopted with British approval, it would
allow Britain to move directly from paper to a credit card-type model if
the Government so wished. It would remain valid for 10 years.

Hill walking is growing in popularity, bringing much pleasure and
better health. That's the upside. The downside is that there is a price,
and it is being paid by the landscape. Peter Evans looks at the efforts
being made to halt erosion
COIRE LAGAN, at the heart of Skye's magnificent Cuillin ridge, is a
special place. Stand at the portals to this great corrie and the scene
is one of Wagnerian splendour: a glinting lochan cradled by a cirque of
jagged peaks, whose serrated outline pierces the sky.
It's a place that attracts hundreds of walkers and climbers like a
magnet, but their feet have done grave damage on the approach to the
corrie, pounding the ground to a pulp in places. Countryside and
recreation consultant Dr Robert Aitken describes it as ''one of the
worst damaged paths in Britain''.
Left alone, it would simply get worse, but help is at hand. A footpath
repair team began work last month to bring the erosion under control,
create a well-surfaced path through the quagmire and boulders, and start
the process of regenerating vegetation.
The Coire Lagan scenario is one mirrored by dozens more, with varying
degrees of severity, across Scotland. Fuelled by a plethora of
guidebooks, TV programmes like The Munro Show, better incomes for the
majority of the population, an expansion of car ownership and good
roads, providing ease of access to the mountains, hill walking has
become increasingly popular, especially in the past 20 years or so.
The health benefits and the enormous pleasure people gain from walking
in some of the most rugged and beautiful scenery in Britain are obvious.
But there is a price to be paid -- and it has been paid by the
landscape.
Footpaths on our most frequented hills have suffered serious erosion,
creating ugly scars and making walking on steep ground potentially
dangerous. The most common cause of accidents in the hills is a simple
slip or stumble, so erosion can contribute to injury, even death.
Anyone who has traversed Glen Coe's exhilarating Aonach Eagach ridge
and descended to the glen by the steep path alongside Clachaig Gully,
will know just how bad it can be. Many other examples exist where the
pressure has taken its toll: Ben Lawers, Ben Lomond, Cairn Gorm, where a
ski-lift makes access even easier, Lochnagar, Stac Pollaidh -- the list
is long and worrying.
Fortunately it's not all depressing news, and strenuous efforts have
been made to tackle the problems and bring the worst excesses of erosion
under control.
Bob Aitken has been at the centre of the drive to repair the damage
and restore some dignity to our beleaguered hills from the outset. Back
in 1982, he was contracted by the Countryside Commission for Scotland to
carry out a survey of Scottish mountain paths, to assess their condition
and the degree of change that had taken place since the war. Using a
combination of field study on the ground and examination of aerial
photographs, the survey confirmed what many had suspected.
''It gave solidity to the feeling everybody had that paths on the
popular hills were falling apart, and that something needed to be
done,'' said Aitken. ''Where there was easy access to high hills, things
had changed pretty radically.''
Following the survey, a Footpath Management Project got under way at
the end of 1983. Aitken's remit was to undertake repair trials using new
materials and techniques and to improve practice in path management
which, until then, had relied on a rudimentary volunteer approach.
''Some of the sites we were looking at were just horrific,'' says
Aitken. He remembers surveying the well-used Coire nam Beith path in
Glen Coe and wondering ''What on earth can we do with this?''
The path very quickly exceeds the 15-degree steepness recognised as
critical for remedial work -- posing difficult challenges for repairers.
But it is a testament to the worth of taking action that the path is now
regarded as a great success story.
It became evident almost immediately that the volunteer approach was
inadequate. Though enthusiastic and hardy, volunteers often lacked skill
and strength, but the most serious shortcoming of their involvement was
its transience. They were typically called in for a 10-day task on a
site and then went away again.
Aitken formed the view that a professional approach was needed, using
workers who could develop skill and expertise in repair techniques over
a long-term period.
This led to the formation of a more permanent team, later to evolve
into an independent company, Pathcraft, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Scottish Conservation Projects Trust, based in Stirling. Pathcraft is
currently one of two specialist footpath contractors operating in
Scotland -- the other being Conserve, based in Grantown-on-Spey.
The continuity in terms of both time and human resources made a huge
difference to the work that could be undertaken. ''We could actually
take sites apart and put them back together in a way we couldn't do
before, and that was a real breakthrough,'' says Aitken.
Experiments were conducted with plastic membranes of the kind used in
road engineering to ''float'' paths across the ground. An example of a
path where the technique was employed to dramatic effect is in Glen
Rosa, on Arran.
Keith Wilson, operations director for Pathcraft, described the work as
''very, very satisfying''. Peat 4-6ft deep in places has a durable, firm
path crossing it which has stood the test of time. After seven years it
is still in good condition.
The key factor here, as elsewhere when specialist repairers have done
the work, is that the path fits naturally into its surroundings. It is
environmentally friendly, and damaged ground adjacent to the path line
has regenerated. ''One of the important achievements of this company has
been proving that this kind of work can be done in an aesthetically
acceptable manner,'' says Wilson.
Aitken reinforces the point. ''It has become increasingly important to
get the landscaping right, to get the style right,'' he says. ''We are
not working on paths to make them easy to walk on. We want to make sure
that we don't get overworked paths. We should try to heal the landscape,
but we must not end up with great highways on to the hills.''
A significant feature of path repair work is that it can provide local
employment opportunities in remote areas of the Highlands where jobs are
scarce. When Pathcraft was launched in 1990 as a stand-alone business,
the workforce numbered 15, employed all year round. Last winter, the
company was employing between 40 and 44 people: seven teams of five
workers on the ground, plus administrative and supervisory staff.
By its very nature the work is hard, physical labour, with people
frequently out thousands of feet up hills in weather many walkers would
be reluctant to brave their Gore-Tex jackets. The pay is low and labour
turnover tends to be high.
One of the biggest problems faced by the specialist path-repair
companies, highlighted by both Wilson and Aitken, is the funding
structure they are forced to operate with, one Aitken says is peculiar
to Scotland.
Based on a competitive-tendering system, it means that the continuity
of work is never guaranteed. ''Each year it's harder to cope with the
fluctuations,'' says Wilson. Whereas Pathcraft's teams were working
flat-out through the winter, and the company had to turn work down, he
was faced with the prospect of laying people off at the beginning of the
new financial year in April.
''We are not looking for an easy ride,'' he says. ''If we were, we
wouldn't be in this business. What we wish to do is to achieve value for
money and, at the same time, demonstrate that there are sustainable,
decent job opportunities for the people living in rural areas of this
country.''
He points out that where lowest cost is treated as value for money,
the quality of work on the ground can suffer, with potentially
disastrous consequences for the landscape if non-specialist workers are
involved.
''That's not how it's done anywhere else in Britain, or even in the
world, as far as I know,'' says Aitken. The problem is essentially bound
up with land ownership, which is more complex and diverse in Scotland.
In the Lake District, a designated national park, much of the land is
owned by the National Trust, and funds have been readily available over
a number of years for footpath repair, with workers employed full-time
and on a continuous basis.
Repairing footpaths is labour-intensive work, costing from #20-#30 a
metre on average. Despite the somewhat ad-hoc position in Scotland, the
encouraging thing is that significant achievements have been made.
''I think footpath management has been one of the success stories in
countryside management in Scotland in the past 10 years,'' says Bob
Aitken. ''More work than ever before is being done on paths. In 1982-83,
when I was doing the reconnaissance review, the total amount the
Countryside Commission for Scotland paid for upland footpath work was
around #2000 a year. Scottish Natural Heritage (the body which succeeded
the CCS) is now paying out around #200,000.''
The walking revolution is unstoppable, and no-one can pretend
otherwise. The need for footpath work and maintenance is likely to
increase. The challenge facing countryside managers, land owners,
funding agencies, repairers, and walkers themselves in the next decade
is how to deal with it in the best way.

LABOUR and Conservative education spokesmen yesterday accused each
other of stealing their party's policy ideas.
Schools Minister Mr Eric Forth told Labour education spokesman Mr
David Blunkett that Labour was guilty of ''political impudence'' in
claiming to be leading the debate on how to deal with failing schools.
Mr Blunkett said the Tories had been stung into action over education
by their ''trouncing'' in the local elections.
The heat on education standards was turned up by a claim by Professor
Michael Barber of Keele University, that one in eight schools is selling
children short. He advised Labour on its Fresh Start policy for schools.
Speaking after a conference in London, Mr Forth said: ''It is
astonishing the speed with which Labour is now accepting nearly every
element of education policy which they argued against in the House of
Commons.
''It is bizarre for them now to suggest that they are leading in this
debate. It is a piece of political impudence and, frankly, a bit of a
try-on.''
Mr Blunkett hit back, saying: ''Obviously, Education Ministers are
upset at their trouncing in the local elections, which were fought with
education as a key issue.''

With the cult of the garden
growing fast, outdoor
furniture is in demand --
by collectors and, reports
Liz Taylor, by thieves
A SURE way of finding out if you have antiques that are rising in
value is to watch what thieves are stealing. In recent years there has
been an epidemic of thefts from gardens, with sundials, statuary urns,
fountains, and Victorian garden chairs being spirited away overnight.
Thieves know that one of the fastest growing areas in collecting is in
garden furniture and architectural items, and over the past 15 years
prices have escalated.
Take Victorian Coalbrookdale iron chairs, for example. They are the
pretty, cast iron seats and benches with backs made of overlaid fern
fronds. Heavy and usually painted white, a pair of chairs in good
condition could have been picked up 15 years ago for around #80. Ten
years later the price had escalated to #800 a pair. Now they have soared
to between #1500 and #2000.
People with such chairs in their gardens are advised to guard them
jealously because they are prime objects of desire for roving felons.
With the cult of the garden growing fast among home-owners, however,
there is a huge demand for attractive and unusual garden furniture and a
saleroom that has made a speciality of such items is Sotheby's at
Billingshurst in Sussex, where, on Tuesday and Wednesday, May 23 and 24,
a big sale is being held with treasures in it to incite the avarice of
garden lovers everywhere.
If the space you have to fill is large, there are fountains, huge
urns, statues of gods and goddesses, busts of Roman emperors, and
life-size models of naked ladies (all in the best possible taste, of
course), sphinxes, sportive putti, resting dogs, and a carved red
sandstone figure of Lord Nelson.
Nelson has an interesting history because he was carved by a Scotsman
called Robert Forrest, who lived between 1790 and 1852 and began life as
a stonemason working in a quarry at Lesmahagow where he carved figures
of animals for his own amusement. In 1817 his work was seen by a Colonel
Gordon who was out shooting and he commissioned the young man to make
him a figure of Bacchus. With Gordon's recommendation, Forrest's career
took off and, working from a quarry near Lanark, he carved many figures,
including another of Nelson for Falcon Hall, Edinburgh, and one for
Henry Dundas on the top of the column in the middle of St Andrews
Square, Edinburgh.
His model of Nelson in the Billingshurst sale is estimated to make
around #18,000.
For the smaller garden there is a selection of Italian carved stone
animals including a frog, dogs, pheasants, pigs, and a group of
squirrels. They range in price from around #80 for a pair of frogs to
#500 for a couple of pigs.
In spite of the curiosity value which they would have, there is as yet
no sign of any Major Ball plaster gnomes making their appearance in the
saleroom, where they would find it hard to compete with such delights as
a terracotta fountain group of a couple of children sheltering under a
bronze umbrella (estimate between #2500 and #4000) or a lead figure of
Punch standing with his hands on his hips and a truculent expression on
his face (expected to make around #5000).
Not all of the lots in the sale are exceptionally old because both the
Punch and the fountain group are twentieth century and there is a
striking Carrara marble statue of a Scottish halfbreed lamb by a
sculptress called Jill Watson who carved it in 1980. Its expected price
is between #3000 and #4000.
Also twentieth century is a little wooden boat in the shape of a swan
with hinged wings and just big enough to hold two people. It was
originally made to be towed behind a pleasure steamer called The Swan
that operated on the River Exe in Devon. Sotheby's expect it to sell for
about #2500.
At the end of the sale there is a section devoted to architectural
items, which are also snapped up today by discerning house renovators.
On offer are nineteenth-century chimneypieces, fireplace insets,
balusters, staircase uprights, stone pillars and columns, lamp bases,
wrought-iron window-box surrounds, weathervanes, lamp standards, and a
Gothic pine pulpit.
IT IS, of course, not necessary to go as far as Billingshurst to find
treasure of this nature, because all over the country architectural
salvage yards have been opening at a rapid rate. A far cry from the
Steptoe and Son junk yard, they specialise in everything from brass
doorhandles to Victorian bathtubs, fireplaces to garden statuary.
In Glasgow there is the Glasgow Architectural Salvage Company at
Colvend Street, run by Neil and Lizzie Barras (tel: 0141 556 7772), who
also have a similar place in Edinburgh; and Adam Hill's ''Retrocurious''
(tel: 0141 334 0086) is also Glasgow-based.
Just south of Berwick-on-Tweed there is a large salvage yard called
Woodside Reclamations, run by Keith Allen and Lynn Gray (tel: 01289
331221), and one of the best is Shiners in Jesmond Road, Newcastle, run
by Barry and Ann Lawson (tel: 0191 281 6474).
Anyone who wants to find the location of all the architectural salvage
yards in Scotland should contact ''Salvo'', set up by Hazel Matravers
and Thornton Kay. For #5.75 they send out an information pack with lists
of salvage yards and one of their monthly newsletters, for which it is
possible to subscribe, for 10 issues, of their newsletter at a cost of
#20 a year.
Hazel Matravers said that they are very conscious of the problem of
theft and so their newsletters always include lists and photographs of
items that have been stolen -- ''and it's amazing how often people get
them back,'' she said. They also ask owners of salvage yards listed by
them to sign a code of practice which should prevent them buying goods
from thieves.
Miss Matravers says that anyone who owns a valuable piece of garden
furniture or statuary should photograph it in case it is ever stolen.
''Written descriptions are never good enough.''

A PILOT accused of flying a seaplane recklessly was found not guilty
yesterday.
Captain Bob Swainston, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, was on trial at
Dumbarton Sheriff Court after an incident in Rhu Narrows, Helensburgh,
last May.
He was alleged to have put lives at risk by taking off too close to
another vessel.
Outside the court, Mr Swainston, a 43-year-old commercial pilot, said:
''I'm delighted with the outcome. I've said all along that I was
innocent and this proves it.''
The court had heard Mr Swainston's Cessna 206 passed within ''30ft''
of a 28ft cabin cruiser and that the vessel, driven by Mr Robert
McKenzie, of Wemyss Bay, had been forced to take avoiding action.
Both Mr McKenzie and his passenger, Mr Paul Edgar, of Gourock, claimed
the plane and the cruiser were on collision course.
However, defence witness, Mr Frank Bradford, insisted that ''the
aircraft was nowhere near the boat''. Mr Bradford, a press photographer,
had just been dropped off by Captain Swainston. He watched the sea-plane
take off from the shore at Silvers Marine Yard.
Mr Paul Bonnet, a security officer at the yard, testified: ''I had a
clear view of what went on. The plane was about 150ft above the boat.''
Sheriff Douglas ruled that the distances given by witnesses could not
be taken as reliable evidence and found Mr Swainston not guilty.
However, he added that the pilot should have taken account of other
vessels. He said: ''I take the view that the accused acted in a way
which was inappropriate, but not reckless. He should have taken into
account the manner in which his sea-plane would be regarded by others on
the Gairloch that evening.
''It wasn't sufficient just to be clear in his own mind that there was
no danger. That was a gross error.''

AN attendant, on duty when a 10-year-old girl drowned, told a fatal
accident inquiry yesterday that glare reflected from windows could
obscure the bottom of the swimming pool.
Mr Christopher McFarlane, 25, was giving evidence at the third day of
the inquiry into the death of Kerry Clark, a non-swimmer, of Criffel
Court, Lincluden, on July 5 last year at the council-owned Dumfries
Swimming Pool.
Earlier, witnesses told how the girl had gone to the pool with 21
other children from a summer playscheme, accompanied by three adults.
Other children said they saw the 10-year-old fall from an inflatable
island at the deep end, where her body was later discovered.
The attendant said he had no difficulty with visibility if the sun was
behind him. However, if it was shining through the windows opposite the
attendant's high chair, it caused a problem.
He said that during training, a child-size dummy had been placed at
the bottom of the pool near the side and he had failed to see it because
of the glare on the surface of the water.
He said: ''We were aware of the difficulty and recognised it as a
problem.''
Mr McFarlane, who holds lifesaving and first-aid certificates, said he
was on duty in the high chair at 11.15am on the day of the accident when
a woman jumped out of the water and told him: ''There's someone at the
bottom of the pool.''
He then heard an alarm go off and saw two attendants, Mr John
Churchill and Mr William Nichol dive in to the pool.
Mr McFarlane, then an attendant for more than two years, said the girl
was retrieved and placed on the side of the pool where staff tried to
revive her. He had fetched resuscitation equipment from the first-aid
room.
The inquiry continues.

DEATHS from one of the most common cancers affecting men could become
preventable as the result of a discovery announced yesterday by
researchers in America.
They have found a gene which appears to suppress the spread of tumour
cells from prostate cancer, which kills about 750 men in Scotland every
year.
This is equivalent to more than half of the cases diagnosed annually
but many more elderly men are known to have prostate cancer without it
doing them any harm.
The problem arises when metastasis takes place and the cancer spreads
to the bones and other parts of the body. This process often begins
before symptoms appear and the cancer is discovered.
Prostate cancer can be detected by raised levels in the blood of a
protein called prostate surface antigen, but this does not distinguish
the 20% who need remedial action and the other 80% for whom aggressive
treatment might do more harm than good.
Researchers led by Carl Barrett at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina and John Isaacs of Johns
Hopkins University have discovered a gene, which they have christened
KAII, which in laboratory tests suppresses the process of metastasis.

A MAJOR backer of the late Roy Castle's crusade against lung cancer
was under fire yesterday for its part in a ''sordid'' promotion to sell
cigarettes.
The Littlewood's Organisation raised #1m for the campaign the
entertainer began last year before he died from lung cancer; now its
Index chain of catalogue shops is helping to promote the sale of Benson
and Hedges cigarettes in a gift scheme.
A non-smoker himself, Castle blamed his disease on the years he spent
breathing in other people's cigarette smoke as he played the trumpet in
night-clubs.
The British Medical Association is calling on the Government to act
over the joint promotion, in which smokers are encouraged to save
coupons to obtain gifts from Index stores, catalogued separately under
the name Gratis.
Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of policy at the BMA, was particularly
angered that children's goods, including cots, were among the gifts on
offer; only this week it emerged that cot deaths in Scotland have
started to climb after a five-year decline, and parental smoking has
been found to increase the risk up to nine-fold.
She claimed the promotion not only breached the voluntary agreement on
tobacco advertising between the Government and the industry -- aimed at
preventing campaigns encouraging smokers to increase cigarette
consumption -- but was a ''blatant attempt'' to persuade parents or
parents-to-be to smoke more.
She went on: ''I could not believe that any tobacco company would be
so gratuitously offensive as to offer child cots as a reward for smoking
more and more cigarettes. In fact, any parent wishing to claim a cot
would have to smoke 13,700 cigarettes between now and October next year
when the offer closes.''
Professor John Moxham of the British Thoracic Society predicted the
offer would lead to a rise in smoking-related deaths.
''This crude incentive to smoke more can only increase the number of
people I will see on my ward rounds dying of smoking-related diseases,''
he said.
The Littlewoods organisation pointed out that last year they raised
well over #1m for the Roy Castle Cause for Hope Appeal, a major
contribution to the building of the world's first research centre into
lung cancer, and based in Liverpool.
''Littlewoods has even more ambitious plans this year, when they will
once again sponsor the Tour of Hope in July,'' said a spokesman.
''We are firmly committed to providing the resources that scientists
need in their search for the causes of lung cancer. However, we also
acknowledge that people should have the freedom to choose whether they
should smoke or not, especially since every packet now clearly spells
out the risk they take in so doing.
''We are not encouraging people to smoke and that is certainly not the
purpose of our promotion. All we aim to do is offer a benefit to those
who already smoke if they buy one particular brand.''
A spokesman for Gallaher's, the makers of Benson and Hedges, said:
''We don't believe the Gratis promotion breaches the voluntary code.''
''The cot is one of a whole range of gifts. I can't comment on the
link between smoking and cot deaths.''

SCOTTISH COUNTRY HOUSES 1600-1914
Edited by Ian Gow and Alistair Rowan
Edinburgh University Press, #35.00
THIS book of essays serves two different but closely connected
purposes. The first is to add to our knowledge of the history of
domestic architecture in Scotland; the second is to honour Catherine
Cruft. In 1991 Kitty Cruft retired as Curator of the National Monuments
Record of Scotland. She had then been associated with that institution's
development for 40 years of its 50-year history and had played a major
role in building it up into the vital and comprehensive archive it now
is. Furthermore, Kitty Cruft felt it was her duty and pleasure to share
the riches of the collection with others. When I visited the Record's
former home in Melville Street in Edinburgh, a little anxious as a
foreigner at trespassing into the preserves of Scottish architectural
historians, Kitty, bustling and ebullient, made me feel at home and
could not have been more helpful.
So she thoroughly deserves this festschrift, as I fear this collection
must be called, for all the distinguished authors are in debt to Kitty.
Inevitably, the book suffers from the usual problems associated with
this kind of enterprise, for the coverage of its stated theme is not
comprehensive and many of the authors have provided snippets of
left-over research dug out of their filing cabinets. Perhaps that does
not matter; several are charmingly idiosyncratic and all are genuine
contributions to knowledge although the most useful have a wider range
and concentrate on the whole Scottish domestic practice of architects
such as Robert Smirke, William Leiper, and the great J J Burnet.
The most stimulating essays, however, are concerned with even broader
themes, which is why this book is of value. Compared with the vast
literature on the history and nature of the English country house, that
on Scottish domestic architecture is exiguous. In some ways that is no
bad thing, as so much of the English writing is as much informed by
snobbery and sentimentality as by a genuine interest in this particular
building type. Such an approach is, of course, not unknown in Scotland.
Even so, there has long been a tendency to interpret the Scottish
country house in English terms, which has led to a concentration of
Palladianism and the eighteenth century and the underrating of the
peculiarly Scottish buildings of earlier centuries.
In this context, Charles McKean's initial polemic on ''Some
'Castle-wise' Country Houses of Early Renaissance Scotland'' is of
particular value. McKean has long been concerned with demonstrating the
Scottishness of Scottish architecture and in this exploration of the
great houses of the sixteenth century -- a subject rendered so sadly
hypothetical in many cases owing to ruination or alteration -- he shows
how those tall, turreted and castellated houses have been
misinterpreted. Far from being archaic survivals of fortified
architecture, they were extravagances in a distinct castle-like style
quite different from anything contemporary in England but with close
links with France -- as might be expected from the history of that
century; not castles, in other words, but Scottish Renaissance palaces.
Aonghus Mackechnie's essay on Post-Reformation Scots Houses again
explores an area which has been comparatively neglected, although
understanding of his conclusions is frustrated by the tiresome paucity
of illustrations in this chapter in particular. In view of the price of
this book -- let alone Kitty Cruft's role in building up what is
primarily a visual archive -- this shortcoming must seem especially
perverse.

A POLICEMAN was accidentally shot in the chest yesterday by a fellow
officer during an operation to foil a raid on a security guard.
He escaped with just bruising -- thanks to body armour.
Armed officers opened fire when a Securicor guard came under attack
from a man with an axe after delivering to the Midland Bank in Stamford
Hill, north London.
The escape of the unnamed officer, who reeled from his colleague's
shot, came just two days after the announcement that body armour is to
be issued to all Metropolitan Police officers.
The near-tragedy was seen as likely to increase already strong support
among policemen and women for the decision of Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Sir Paul Condon.
A witness told how other policemen quickly surrounded the man who had
been hit, propping him against a wall as it became clear he was not
seriously hurt.
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: ''During the operation, an armed
police officer was struck in the chest by a bullet, but as he was
wearing body armour he did not sustain any serious injury.''
The officer was discharged from hospital after checks.
The backing for body armour, expected to be approved by the Yard's
policy board on May 24, was announced after mounting pressure for all
police to carry guns routinely.
Yesterday's shooting came after Flying Squad officers waited to ambush
the attacker, who made his move when the guard came out of the bank,
said the Yard spokeswoman.
''A suspect came out of an alleyway wielding an axe, he struck the
guard with the axe, believed to be three times, causing slash injuries.
The armed officers challenged the suspect and shots were fired,'' she
added.
The raider was uninjured and arrested. An axe was recovered from the
scene and a Scotland Yard said a man was in custody in Golders Green
police station.
The guard was discharged after treatment in Homerton Hospital, said
the Yard spokeswoman.
The Midland Bank said the guard had made a delivery and was leaving
when he was attacked. He had no money on him.
One police bullet was fired into the window frame of a travel agents.
Manageress Tina Ashton, 21, said: ''We heard the shot and ran to the
window.
''There seemed to be police everywhere. I heard them say 'armed police
-- do not move'. There was a policeman in plainclothes who had been
shot.''
She added: ''He was being propped up against a wall by other
policemen. A man carrying an axe was lying in the road.
''He was quickly surrounded by police who were aiming guns at him.
They took the axe and handcuffed him,'' she said.

FOOTBALL hooligans are being recruited by an extreme right-wing group
planning to disrupt next summer's European Championships in England, it
was claimed yesterday.
Combat 18 is urging rival soccer groups to put aside their differences
and work together, the editor of Searchlight, the anti-Fascist magazine,
told a European Parliament hearing into soccer violence.
Mr Gerry Gable told the hearing in London: ''We know that Combat 18
have already started staging their bid for what's going to happen. They
have already started working those areas where matches will be played
quite hard.
''The thing that is frightening is that, in one area where a number of
local clubs have been rivals, they are actively working together this
season in preparation for next year.''
Mr Gable's comment followed a report from Searchlight researcher Nick
Lowles on how Combat 18 has been targeting football hooligans for
political ends.
''Unlike the British National Party and the National Front, the main
far-right groups in Britain in the 80s, Combat 18 didn't have to juggle
respectability with football violence. Combat 18 was out and out
violence. It thrived on the publicity and thuggery element.''
The group took a gang of 25 to Norway for the World Cup qualifying
match in 1993, he said.
''They kicked off trouble in Oslo, they ended up leading a group of
almost 300 people.''
Combat 18 had also linked up with German far-right groups to plan an
attack on a Turkish human rights demonstration the day before the
''Hitler's birthday'' match between Germany and England in Berlin, which
was eventually called off and the plan dropped, he said.
This year, they had been targeting Chelsea, so that Combat 18 groups
from around the country had turned up at Chelsea away games in Bruges
and Zaragoza.
The analysis came as German Green MEP Claudia Roth took evidence for a
report she is compiling on soccer violence in Europe.
She expects to complete it for the European Parliament's civil
liberties and internal affairs committee by the autumn.
After the hearing, she said she was worried by what she had heard
about next year's championships.
''I am concerned that these warnings are often neglected,'' she said.
She said she was ''disappointed'' that the football unit of the
National Criminal Intelligence Service did not take up an invitation to
attend.
''I do not know why they could not participate. I think it would have
been very helpful to have sat together and for me to have heard their
ideas.''
The Home Office plans to make a written submission to her, as does the
Football Association.
The Professional Footballers' Association also declined an offer to
attend.
Academic John Williams, of Leicester University, said supporters of
the national team often looked like ''an army of young men''.
It would be better if they could include black British people, women,
and families, he said.
Mr Rick Parry, chief executive of the FA Premier League, told how he
accompanied Newcastle to play in Antwerp this season, and saw fans who
were banned from St James' Park buying tickets on the day of the match.
He summed up the dilemma, saying: ''On the one hand, you've got
innocent supporters being treated in a draconian way, and on the other
hand troublemakers not being spotted at all. How you strike a balance is
the crucial question.''

A CHARGE against a 14-year-old boy of repeatedly raping a schoolgirl
of twelve during a walk in the woods, was found not proven at the High
Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
The girl had told the court she and the accused had earlier been part
of a group of 25 youngsters who regularly met at weekends outside a
Glenrothes school and an underpass to drink cider, smoke, and ''kiss and
cuddle''.
She said she had been drinking cider from a bottle with her friends
and, when the boy had said he wanted to show her something, had gone
into nearby woods with him.
She said she had not objected when the 14-year-old boy kissed her on
the mouth. But he then ordered her to strip. He indecently assaulted her
and forced her to have sex with him on the ground.
She told the court she was a virgin until the incident, and said she
had done as the boy told her because she was scared.
The boy, who denied assault and repeated rape, claimed that the girl
was willing to have sex with him.
After the jury's unanimous verdict, Judge Lord MacLean told him: ''You
appreciate from the jury's verdict that you have been acquitted of a
very serious charge. That means you are free to go.''
The boy's mother, who had been in court throughout the trial, wept as
her son left the dock.
The girl was not in court to hear the verdict.

FORMER Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan is to marry Miss Jemima
Goldsmith, 21-year-old daughter of millionaire Sir James Goldsmith.
The announcement was made last night in a brief statement from a
public relations company acting for Sir James.
Only three months ago, amid reports that he had put his night-clubbing
days behind him as he took more interest in politics, 42-year-old Mr
Khan was talking about marriage -- and saying ''it would help'' if his
bride was Muslim.
He added: ''At my age, it's about finding the right sort of woman with
the same ambitions.
''She doesn't have to be the same race but it would help if she was
Muslim. I have been with some very beautiful women and admit that I had
a reputation as a playboy.
''But my efforts are being concentrated here in Pakistan.''
Last night's statement said: ''Sir James and Lady Annabel are pleased
to announce the marriage of their daughter to Imran Khan. It will take
place at the end of June.''
The spokesman was unable to say where the wedding would be held, or
give any further details.
''I am afraid there is absolutely nothing more I can add at this
stage,'' he said. ''The family is not prepared to add to this statement
in any way.''
Mr Khan, embroiled in years of controversy over allegations of
tampering with cricket balls, also earned himself a reputation as a sex
symbol.

SIX Algerian immigrants, currently in Greenock Prison awaiting

They are seeking asylum from their native country, which is in the
midst of a civil war, estimated to have claimed 40,000 lives in the past
three years. A week ago today Alan Wilson, from Edinburgh, was murdered
along with four other foreign workers.
The six were detained for a variety of alleged breaches of immigration
regulations and are being held in a prison wing with convicted and
remand prisoners.
The news of their hunger strike coincides with the release of an
Amnesty International study which claims that the policy of detaining
asylum-seekers is wasting millions of pounds every year.
As the hunger strikers prepared to go into the sixth day, one of them,
Rached, 31, told The Herald that it would continue as long as necessary
to force immigration authorities to reconsider their cases.
He said he was prepared to die in jail rather than return to Algeria.
He added that he had been behind bars for four weeks but some of the
others had been locked up for six months without trial.
Rached, who spoke on the condition that we did not use his full name,
said: ''We started the hunger strike to express our anger. We are being
treated as prisoners but we have done nothing other than try to escape
the bloodshed in our own country.''
Rached, a Muslim from the capital Algiers who studied computing in
London, said he was an innocent victim of the struggle between the
Algerian military government forces and Islamic fundamentalists.
He said: ''My family begged me not to come back after the war started.
My brother has been in a desert prison since 1992. He is not involved in
any politics but he is against the military government.
''It's a brutal war, and if I went back anything could happen.''
Rached first applied for asylum when war broke out and he was living
in the UK. It was rejected and he made plans to go to Canada. However,
when he tried to leave he was detained at Glasgow airport.
He said: ''The record hunger strike is 65 days and I would be prepared
to do that -- I've got nothing to lose.''
Glasgow lawyer Mr Dilip Deb represented Rached when he was seeking
interim liberation order. Mr Deb said the courts were increasingly
demanding that suspected illegal immigrants pay cash sureties of up to
#20,000 for their freedom pending an investigation.
He said: ''Prison is not the right environment for detainees. Cases
should not be
subject to financial considerations, they should be based individual
circumstances.''
He said the only legal challenge now open to Rached was a judicial
review in the Court of Session.
Greenock prison is the main holding centre used by immigration
authorities in Scotland. Governor Mr Daniel Gunn said there were
currently 19 ''persons awaiting deportation''. He confirmed that the six
were refusing prison meals and their medical condition was being
monitored, with no current cause for concern.
Mr Gunn said: ''We are making every effort to persuade them this is
not the most effective way of drawing attention to their cause.
''We are trying to meet their needs as best we can by providing
religious requirements, cultural contacts and dietary requests -- we
offer the best regime possible.''
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said the department could not
comment on individual cases.
The Amnesty International study released yesterday showed that about
32,000 people applied for asylum last year. An estimated 1500 were
detained. Many would eventually be granted asylum.
By avoiding such detentions, the Home Office could save almost #9m of
the estimated #20m annual bill for detaining asylum seekers, it was
estimated.
Amnesty International's refugee officer Richard Dunstan called for a
change in the way asylum seekers were detained.
At present, it was at the discretion of low-ranking officers at the
immigration service, not senior officials at the Home Office; they were
held indefinitely; were not informed of the reasons for the detention;
and could not challenge the decision in courts. Their average length of
detention was five months, but some were held for more than 18 months.
A spokesman for Amnesty said the number of Algerian refugees had been
high in recent years. He said: ''The situation in Algeria is of great
concern to us -- many innocent people are getting caught up in the
crossfire.''

GAVIN Hastings, the inspiration behind the resurgence of Scottish
rugby fortunes this season, is the winner of this year's Herald Player
of the Year award.
The Scotland captain, holder of the Scottish cap and points' scoring
records, received the trophy, and a cheque for #1000, last night at a
ceremony in the Sheraton Hotel, Edinburgh, from the chairman of
Caledonian Newspapers, Mr Liam Kane.
Hastings, who will retire from the international stage after the World
Cup in South Africa, was the runaway winner in The Herald readers' poll.
This season, as the Scottish side emerged from the dark days of nine
games without a win, Hastings has provided a sterling lead for a young
side which finished runners-up in the Five Nations' tournament and laid
to rest the grim statistic of 26 years without a win in Paris.
That Parc des Princes game, in which Hastings scored a spectacular
try, was his personal highlight of a season which saw the Scots confound
the critics and challenge England for the Grand Slam at Twickenham.
The Herald Rugby Awards, which were recorded by BBC Scotland for
screening tonight in a Sportscene Rugby Special programme, are now in
their third year and have become a glittering finale to the Scottish
season.
The ceremony was chaired by TV presenter Dougie Donnelly. Each winner
received a handsomely-crafted trophy and a cash award which goes either
to his club or to the Scotland squad trust fund.
The winner of the McEwan's 70/- Team of the Year category was Stirling
County. The Bridgehaugh club, which has performed the unique achievement
of climbing through the ranks from Division VII to become Scotland's top
side, was the unanimous choice of the judging panel which comprised
Herald rugby writers and representatives from co-sponsor companies.
The award, and a cheque for #1000, was presented last night to
Stirling County president Bill Gibson by Mr Collin Wood, managing
director Scottish Brewers.
The judging panel felt, also, that Garnock RFC, which won Division VII
with a 100% playing record, and Division VI winners Annan RFC deserved
special commendation.
In the Royal Bank of Scotland Most Promising Young Player of the Year
category, the judging panel decided that the award should go to the
Scotland under-21 flanker and captain Graham Dall of Heriot's FP.
Dall, 19, follows in the footsteps of previous winners Gregor Townsend
and Craig Joiner, both of whom went on to make their mark in the full
international arena. He has represented Scotland at all age-group levels
from under-15 upwards -- leading Scottish Schools to a historic Sydney
win over Australia in 1993 -- and later this month he will be a member
of the Scotland Development squad which is touring Zimbabwe.
The young Herioter received the award, and the accompanying cheque for
#1000, from Royal Bank chief executive Dr George Mathewson. The judges
chose Dall in the face of stiff competition from, among others, the
Heriot's FP wing-threequarter Hugh Gilmour, the Watsonian Duncan Hodge,
Gordon Bulloch of West of Scotland, Matt McGrandles of Stirling County,
and the promising St Aloysius College and Scottish Schools
wing-threequarter James Craig.
The Highland Spring Try of the Year category was won by Eric Peters
for his touchdown for Scotland against Wales at Murrayfield in March.
The winning try, a classic which was born deep within Scotland's half,
was chosen by viewers of the BBC Scotland Rugby Special programme.
Last night the trophy, and the #1000 cheque, were presented to the
Bath and Scotland No.8 by Highland Spring chief executive, Mr Joe
Beeston.
The principal toast of the evening, to Sport and the Scottish Rugby
Union, was proposed by Minister for Sport Mr Iain Sproat.
Mr Sproat sang the praises of Gavin Hastings and his men this season.
''Although ultimately ending in defeat at Twickenham, the Scottish team
has left us with many wonderful memories from the 1995 international
season,'' he said.
''To name but two, the sight of the Scotland captain rampaging through
the beleaguered French back division in Paris and the try by Eric Peters
at Murrayfield, surely the finest of the Five Nations championship. With
performances like these, the Scottish side deserves every success at the
World Cup in South Africa.''
He said: ''My department is working on a major sports policy paper to
be published in early summer. It will focus on strengthening sport in
schools and building links between schools and clubs. At every level I
want to ensure that talented competitors have the support and
opportunity to exploit their abilities to the full. I hope that the
future stars of Scottish rugby will emerge from our new initiatives.''
The toast to Guests, Sponsors, and Supporters was proposed by Scottish
Rugby Union president Mr Ken Smith who said that the game currently
enjoyed a higher than ever profile. This was due not only to the
marketing efforts of the SRU but also to the column inches devoted to
the game by The Herald and its competitors and all of those who backed
Scottish rugby.
He said: ''Our international players have done a superb job of putting
Scottish rugby back on the map and I would also like to record our
appreciation of the wonderful support that the SRU patron, the Princess
Royal, has provided once again this season when she attended six out of
seven Scotland matches.''
Mr Smith paid tribute to the lead given by Gavin Hastings and thanked,
too, manager Duncan Paterson and his management team. ''Looking forward
to next season with the exciting new league structure, there may be
fine-tuning required but you would all agree with me that it must be
made to work.''
Other speakers included Mr Fred Cogley, RTE head of sport, who
proposed the toast to Friendship and the game of Rugby, and the governor
of HM Institute Corntonvale, Mr Robbie Glen, who proposed a toast
entitled The Outside View.

A CHAMBERMAID was last night fighting for her life after being stabbed
in the heart as she cleaned a room at a hotel in the centre of
Edinburgh. It was the second stabbing attack on a woman within 24 hours.
Mrs Kay Harper, 28, a mother-of-two from Leith, was found behind a
bedroom door at the Osbourne Hotel in York Place around 11am.
Mr David Harper was last night at his wife's hospital bedside. He told
friends he was not going to leave until doctors assure him that she will
win her fight for life.
Surgeons worked for eight hours to attempt to close two stab wounds in
Mrs Harper's heart.
The couple's children, Paul, eight, and Ian, four were being cared for
by neighbours.
Mr John Dinnie, a close friend of the couple, said Mrs Harper was a
kind woman who never had a cross word for anyone.
He said: ''You couldn't meet a nicer woman. She is the shy, quiet type
who just loves her family. She has no enemies and we just can't
understand why anyone would want to do this to her.
''What ever kind of man did this to Kay deserves to be hanged. Any man
who attacks a woman is scum, but the type of assault Kay has suffered is
the work of an animal.
''This man needs to be caught -- and quickly. Someone must know who
did this to Kay, and they must come forward and tell the police.''
He said this could prevent another woman being attacked by the man.
He added: ''Kay's husband is sitting up at the hospital in pieces. He
is putting on a brave face, but you can see the anger and hurt in his
eyes.
''We haven't had the heart to tell the two boys how bad their mum is.
They know she is hospital but just think she took a turn at work. How
can we tell them what has really happened?''
Nineteen hours earlier, bride-to-be Jill Barclay, 25, from Livingston
was stabbed five times as she worked in a shop in Armadale, West
Lothian. She is seriously ill in hospital.
Police chiefs said they had no reason to link the attacks but said
they were treating both as attempted murder.
Detective Chief Inspector Ronald Turnbull said the attack on Mrs
Harper was ''vicious, brutal, and seemingly unprovoked''. Police want to
interview a man seen leaving the hotel and heading towards the bus
station just after the incident.
He is aged between 26 and 30, around 5ft 8in, with broad shoulders,
and short, light brown, blondish hair. He was wearing a zipped-up
leather jacket, dark jeans, and carrying a black bag.
The 52-bedroom hotel was closed yesterday as forensic teams scoured
the scene for clues.
Workers at the hotel near St James Centre last night were trying to
come to terms with what happened to their colleague who underwent eight
hours of surgery in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Her condition was
described as critical.
Ms Jackie Robertson, 32, a barmaid in the hotel said: ''I just can't
believe it. This is a nice, respectable hotel with a good clientele.
''I came in to get my wages and wasn't allowed into the hotel because
of what happened. I'm shocked. It was a frightening thing.''
Friends near Mrs Harper's home said she was pleasant woman who kept
herself to herself.

<HEADLINE>Rifkind splits with Major on devolution Rifkind at odds over devolution Tory fightback in disarray</HEADLINE>

MR JOHN Major's political fightback was thrown into disarray last
night as his Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, declared he had ''no
problems'' with the principle of Scottish devolution.
Mr Rifkind's intervention came barely two hours after Mr Major had
warned Scottish Tories that a devolved Scottish parliament would be a
''stepping stone'' towards an independent Scotland.
It threatened to undermine Mr Major's carefully-laid strategy to
revitalise the Government's fortunes with a massive exercise to consult
party members and an attack on Labour's devolution plans.
Mr Rikfind, a former Scottish Secretary, told Channel 4 News: ''I have
no problems about the principle of devolution or of constitutional
change if there are proposals which can apply throughout the United
Kingdom and create a stable constitutional structure.
''The vast majority of Scots would like to have Scottish parliaments
or assemblies or whatever, if opinion polls are to be believed, but they
also want to remain part of the United Kingdom and it is how you
reconcile both these aspirations. That is when it starts getting
difficult.''
He attacked Labour's proposals for devolution as ''absurd'' because
they failed to deal with the question of how constitutional change would
be extended to England.
Nevertheless, his comments are likely to infuriate Mr Major, who sets
great store by the Union and who has consistently set his face against
any form of devolution.
Last night, the Scottish National Party was quick to exploit what they
claim is a major gaffe by Mr Rifkind.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's parliamentary candidate in Perth and
Kinross said: ''While John Major behaves like a waiter on the Titanic,
asking passengers what they want as the Tory ship goes down, Malcolm
Rifkind seeks a lifeboat -- no matter how leaky -- but his party will
not let him have one.''
Labour deputy leader John Prescott seized on Mr Rifkind's comments as
another example of Government disarray.
''Malcolm Rifkind let out his real views and so exposed for what it is
the sham of the Tories' assault on Labour's devolution plans. Yet again
they are in a complete shambles,'' he said.
Mr Jack McConnell, the general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party
said: ''It is clear that the Prime Minister and his Cabinet cannot agree
even on his flagship policy. Mr Rifkind's comments have struck absolute
chaos and confusion at the heart of the Government.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond commented: ''No sooner has Major dug his last
ditch against constitutional change than his Defence Secretary is
sounding the evacuation.
''In breaking ranks at this critical moment, Rifkind is placing a bomb
under his Prime Minister.''
Mrs Veronica Linklater, the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Perth
and Kinross by-election, commented: ''This is a clear endorsement of the
Liberal Democrats' plans for a federal United Kingdom.
''The Conservative candidate's credibility in this by-election has
been shot to pieces. He has been fighting a single issue campaign and
now a senior Cabinet Minister says that he is wrong and we are right on
that issue.''
In his speech to the Scottish Conservative Conference in Glasgow, Mr
Major strongly attacked the idea of a devolved parliament and called for
''shock troops'' in the defence of the Union.
Only a ''very tiny number'' of Scots Tories wanted devolution, he
believed. He pledged: ''As long as I have heart and voice, I will defend
the Union against all who would weaken it.''
He told about 900 of them at the Glasgow rally that he wants them to
become ''evangelists'' in this cause.
Mr Major appeared to lift the morale of the Scottish Tories who had
been issued with Union Jacks to wave during his five-minute ovation. He
dismissed Labour as ''tartan taxers'' and the Nationalists as tartan
socialists. The Prime Minister seems to be taking to his soap box again.
Mr Major pitched his bid for revival and unity on a massive manifesto
consultation over the next 12 months. He aims to build a ''people's
policy to bridge the gap between the doorsteps of Britain and the
corridors of power.''
He acknowledged that the local election defeats were ''none of your
doing'' and he hopes to put the Government back in touch with its
hard-pressed supporters. ''It is right for us now to discuss with you,
the bedrock of our party, what you want to see in the next manifesto,''
he said.
''I will be the first leader in our party's history to give every
member in every constituency an historic opportunity -- an invitation to
help shape the policies of the future.''
He called it ''an unprecedented exercise in consultation.''
Ministerial-led policy on more than 30 policy areas are to report to
him next month. ''From this summer to next spring, there will be a
series of discussions across the party and across the country.'' Themes:
economic prosperity, choice, law and order, public services, and
national pride. Conferences will follow in Scotland, England and Wales.
He intends to supervise it himself: ''I am going to be out and about,
to meet you, to talk to you and to listen to you.
''And when we've reached a policy conclusion, I'm going to ask the
nation for a majority sufficient to put it into operation. I believe
that the commonsense of Conservatives up and down the land is the best
guarantee that we will enter the twenty-first century with the right
policies for our nation's future.''
Mr Major made it clear to his Scottish conference yesterday that the
democratisation of the manifesto did not mean that all policies would be
popular. ''If we're really determined to build security and prosperity
for all then we must continue to build an enterprise economy. And to do
that we must take the tough decisions to create it.
''Sometimes they'll be unpopular. Because it means resisting the
clamour of every interest group for higher spending. It means clamping
down on inflation, however loud the protests. And it means cutting state
borrowing, whatever the moans.''
The rewards, he said, are to be found in a Scotland that is in the
forefront of new technologies and attracting inward investment from
across the globe. A competitive Britain is now in trade surplus with
Japan.
Mr Major anticipates from his manifesto consultation exercise strong
views on law and order and maintaining Britain's national integrity in
Europe: ''We should put the rights of the public first and the rights of
the criminal second. If people break the law, they should not be
excused. They should not be pampered. They should be punished. That is
what our policies will deliver.
''The European Community provides us with the biggest home market in
the world and it has contributed to maintaining peace.
''So I want Europe to succeed. But not at any price. And not at the
expense of the nation-state. I will not deliver Britain to a federalist
future.''
After 16 years in power, his party is still ''fizzing'' with ideas.
Before the summer, he plans to announce a bold expansion of nursery
education and housing proposals.
Labour could reverse the economic transformation in one term of
government, he claimed. Changing Clause 4 does not make them a modern
party. Labour opposes rail and nuclear privatisation, compulsory
competitive tendering and threatens controls on privatised companies.
The Social Chapter of the Maastricht treaty and a minimum wage would
devastate jobs. Labour voted against tougher action against criminals,
rioters, prisoners, and terrorists.
He described Labour's devolution plans as a ''shambles'', unclear
about the cost, the future of the Scottish Office, and Scottish
representation in a British Parliament: ''Labour's approach to
devolution is as elusive as the Loch Ness Monster but a good deal more
dangerous. Nessie brings jobs to Scotland. Devolution would drive them
away.''
He described Labour's plans as ''the most cynical policy of modern
times'', devised to lure votes from the Nationalists.
His attack on the SNP, heading up the opinion polls on the Perth and
Kinross by-election, was withering: ''The SNP aren't Tartan heroes. They
should be seen for what they are. They are socialists. They are
unilateralists. And they are politically extreme.
''They thrive on negative resentment, the culture of criticism. They
kick traditional institutions just to feel good. It's a dangerous game
to play. The SNP's approach boils down to one phrase: socialism in one
country. It can never work. Our task is to make sure that it is never
tried.''

EXCLUSIVE
NURSES at Glasgow's Sick Children's Hospital are ready to resign in
protest at the Government's 3% pay deal which they claim will result in
dramatic cuts in their income.
The pay dispute escalated last night as the full extent of the strings
attached to offers by Scottish trusts was revealed.
Unions claimed many of the deals meant cuts in holiday, night-shift
and unsocial hours' allowances, longer working hours, regrading, and
acceptance of local pay bargaining.
The Royal College of Midwives said the dispute had now gone well
beyond the question of pay and had developed into unprecedented attacks
on working conditions and hours.
A junior doctor at Glasgow's Sick Children's Hospital -- who asked to
remain anonymous to protect his job -- last night told The Herald that a
group of at least six specialist paediatric nurses are ready to resign
in protest at the 3% deal imposed by the Scottish Office on Tuesday.
He said the conditions attached to the deal offered by the Royal
Hospital Sick Children's Trust -- which also includes the maternity unit
-- meant that many nurses would experience a pay cut.
''It's a Catch 22,'' he said. ''If they accept a 1% pay rise, they are
basically okay. But the 3% deal has all manner of strings needed to fund
the deal.
''First is the removal of five public holidays which receive enhanced
payments to be replaced by five ordinary days' holiday. And night staff
will also lose two 60-minute unsocial hours payments on each shift they
work.''
Mr Gerry Marr, chief executive of the trust, defended the offer as
''reasonable''. He added: ''The nurses will make money out of this deal
and strings don't come into effect until next year. We have time to sit
down sensibly with our nurses over the next nine months to discuss the
issue.''
The Royal College of Nursing said only two trusts -- Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary and North Ayrshire -- had made 3% offers without any strings.
The college is due to vote on industrial action at its congress in
Harrogate next week.
Its Scottish Secretary, Ms June Andrews, said: ''We are really
disappointed. I would be surprised if there is not an overwhelming rush
of emotion at Harrogate.''
One week ago, only a handful of Scottish trusts had made any offer,
compared to more than 100 in England and Wales giving the full 3%
without strings.
On Tuesday, the Scottish NHS chief executive, Mr Geoff Scaife, ordered
all 47 trusts to make offers within 48 hours. Some trust managers argued
against such a hurried response but, by last night, 40 had complied.
The Herald understands the rush to submit offers in Scotland may have
been triggered by Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley in an effort to
avert calls for industrial action at the Royal College of Nurses
congress.

A SEARCH and rescue off the Caithness coast was underway early this
morning after a woman's body was found on the cliffs at Holburn Head
near Thurso.
An RAF helicopter and lifeboat was still trying to locate a second
woman -- believed to have been washed out to sea -- following reports
that two people were missing.
The Pentland coastguard said the search and rescue operation would
continue through the night.
It is understood the two women, both in their thirties, had been
walking along the cliff top.
