GLASGOW'S latest concert venue houses a multiplicity of activities.
Yet another refurbished church, Adelaide's Baptist Church in Bath
Street, while sustaining its religious function, also doubles as a
concert hall, and houses a creche, a guest house, and a restaurant.
Yesterday the venue launched a new strand to its operation: a series
of fortnightly lunchtime concerts, which look to be a sort of corollary
to the Thursday venture in the Merchant's Hall, at the other end of
town.
The tone of the new series, established in the first concert
yesterday, is one of informality and relaxation -- and there is an
audience, whether shoppers or older patrons, who like just that. For the
price of a ticket (#4) you also get something to eat and drink.
Mezzo soprano Alison Barton and clarinettist Lawrence Gill, both
accompanied by pianist Julia Lynch, further established the tone with a
programme of generally lightish classics, introduced by the performers
themselves.
Love songs, buoyant and dark, from Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and
Rachmaninov, were performed by Alison Barton, who has a rich lower
register, while Lawrence Gill played lilting, gentle music by Pierne and
Saint-Saens, bringing a note of rollicking high jinks into the
proceedings with the riotous last movement of Poulenc's Clarinet Sonata.
Julia Lynch gave another portrait of Poulenc -- as parodist -- in an
affectionate performance of his Novelettes.
Nice, civilised idea, this series, with tables provided round the
perimeter of the performing arena.
Classic menu: Alison Barton who sang at the first of a new series of
fortnightly lunchtime concerts at Adelaide's Baptist Church.

WHENEVER a television playwright mourns the death of the single play
-- generally while invoking the Blessed Dennis Potter -- I begin to
wonder who is kidding whom. True, much of what is today passed off as TV
drama amounts to little more than pre-shrunk genre thrillers, a dreary
spin cycle of doctors, police, firemen, vets, and lawyers. This doesn't
mean that true scribblers everywhere are as eager to say what they have
to say in 60 minutes as they like to claim.
So much seems clear from the opening episode of Alan Bleasdale's
generously-hyped Jake's Progress (Channel Four, Thursday). The first of
six, this consumed over an hour and a half of airtime, implying that we
are in for nine hours of unhappy families, childhood dysfunction, and
purest trauma in the weeks ahead.
Does the heart soar? Not a lot. Bleasdale is superb with raw emotion,
with the bleeding wounds of love and hate. He revels -- for he is a real
dramatist after all -- in the unmerciful logic of conflict and the
incoherent delirium of pain. But nine hours, each of them spent in the
certain knowledge of what lies ahead? How much pre-ordained suffering do
we want or need?
Pacing himself with a snail, Bleasdale unfolded the opening episode
with leisurely, delicate care. Here was Robert Lindsay as the ostensibly
chirpy, unemployed house-husband who has adjusted in every respect save
those that matter to the treadmill of domestic trivia. Here was Julie
Walters, his tight-lipped wife, a hard-working nursing sister who earns
the bread and the guilt for being away from her son. Here was Dorothy
Tutin as the granny from hell. And here, wonderfully played by little
Barclay Wright, was Jake, the child with problems.
It was as though Bleasdale was drawing the viewer a diagram of what
the shrinks call family dynamics. He made it all seem so predictable
(who couldn't have guessed Walters was to fall pregnant again?) that you
began to wonder if he was setting himself a test. With all these hours
yet to fill, how was he going to surprise us? As it turned out we got
hints of the supernatural, which is rarely a welcome development. Nic
Roeg did all that 20 years ago, to most people's satisfaction and
distress, in the truly disturbing Don't Look Now. In a setting such as
Bleasdale's, the device looks like a gimmick, an attempt to enliven
proceedings which otherwise might bog down in the trenches of family
warfare. Let's hope these first impressions are mistaken.
Unmistakably, for this reviewer's money, the only thing that separated
Bliss (ITV, Wednesday) from a turkey was the absence of cranberry sauce.
A concatenation of science-fiction cliches, it had about as much life to
it as the corpses which kept turning up drained, like the dialogue, of
their life's blood.
The sub-text was a purported cure for ageing, and as we watched Simon
Shepherd go through his paces as the handsome Cambridge scientist the
minutes did indeed seem to lengthen. In fact, the piece was half
complete before the various premises, such as they were, were
established. The only real fun was someone's decision to run an ad for
something called Revitalift, an anti-ageing cream, during one of the
breaks. It was already too late.
On Sunday, meanwhile, the people at Timewatch (BBC2) were trying to
prove that it's never too late to mend, at least if you happen to go by
the name of Eric Bloodaxe, Sven Throatripper, Ingmar Legchopper or the
like.
Evidence of Vikings set out to examine the claim that the norsemen
were just a bunch of lads who've had a bad press, not least from the
Christian churches. Certainly they ripped out of the odd lung but, hey,
if you're saddled with a moniker like Ivar the Boneless, these things
happen.
The real purpose of the piece, amid some fun with the sort of loons
who like to dress up and re-enact battles because, as one hero admitted,
they ''just like fighting, really'', was to establish whether the
Vikings were uniquely vicious. Which is to say, did their rapid reaction
forces ignore the accepted rules of engagement of their day?
To the layman, it seemed an argument between romantics, who like their
norsemen traditional, which is to say mean, and a newer wave who seem to
have the evidence on their side but who here managed to make the Oslo
awkward squad sound prosaic, not to say plain dull. Otherwise we
learned, once again, that, no, they didn't wear horns on their hats. But
who would?
In some circles Gore Vidal is treated as the next best thing to a
horned beast, a mischievous old devil who has spent his career
undermining his country while promoting unnatural acts, teasing the
Christians, and suggesting that democracy wouldn't be a bad idea one of
these days. This column regards him as the best and funniest prose
stylist America has produced since the war, so if I say that Omnibus:
Gore Vidal's Gore Vidal (BBC1, Monday) was a shade pedestrian, you can
imagine how disappointed I feel.
This was the first of two, ostensibly to mark the old smoothie's 70th
birthday, in reality to plug the volume of memoirs he said he would
never write. It related the events of the first half of Vidal's life
well enough but it, like him, seemed both weary and wintry, as though a
spark had gone out. The contrast with the memoirs themselves, a book
both civilised and civilising, was startling.
Vidal affects to believe that his story is America's story, but that
isn't really true. Watching him, plainly out of place, at a family
gathering of staunchly redneck Gores was to realise how much his country
has changed while he has remained the same.
Bewildered that so many of his tribe, intelligent, professional people
among them, had succumbed to revivalist religion, he was obliged to turn
to the southern novelist Eudora Welty for guidance. Once upon a time,
that would never have happened. Otherwise this was biography more
conventional than its subject has ever been.
Finally, an idle question. What has gone wrong with The People's
Century (BBC1, Wednesday)? After four superb installments suddenly we
were exposed to an examination of sport's emergence as mass
entertainment, political weapon, and big business.
It is a legitimate subject for study, of course, and vastly more
important than is usually imagined. But couldn't the makers have
squeezed in Modernism, the movies, Einstein, or the rise of fascism
before concentrating on Joe Louis knocking lumps out of the Aryan hero
Max Schmelling? Just a thought.

MAYBE it has something to do with the unpretentiousness of the Celtic
race, not to mention the Celtic team, but footballers who arrive in
Scotland from places that were beyond what was once the Iron Curtain
seem to settle comfortably into the western players' lifestyle.
Like many of his predecessors at Parkhead, Andreas Thom is managing to
cope rather well with his new environment, but he did have the advantage
of moving into West German society from his East German career, and
knows the difference from first hand experience.
However, while Andreas may have gained considerably, and in financial
terms greatly, from leaving Dinamo Berlin when the Wall and its
political apologists were removed, if you seek to hear him condemn his
homeland, you might have to wait along time.
Speaking a little in English and also through an interpreter this
week, the forward, who has made an immediate and exciting impact on the
Scottish game, refused to denigrate the lifestyle from which he had
emerged, but was quick to point out that footballers in the old East
Germany were better off than the ordinary working men. ''There was no
professionalism, of course, but we had the status of a professional. We
didn't get that kind of money, though.
''A quality player could earn more than other workers but that is
still the same after unification.'' Thom was spotted by the Boys' Club
associated with Dinamo, and when he was only nine, travelled by bus and
train from his home town, Hertsfelde, a 90-minute journey, and back two
and three times a week for training.
Encouraged by his parents and brother, Thom progressed until he was
taken into the Dinamo senior side, where he played in the first team
from 1983 until 1990.
''I had a tremendous time with Dinamo and it was very difficult for me
when I made the move to Bayer Leverkusen, leaving all the friends I had
behind.
''Everybody in Scotland has been very kind to me, but I had already
made many friends in Leverkusen, too. I hope the same thing will happen
here.'' Andreas, predictably shortened to ''Andy' at Parkhead as it was
in Germany, is unquestionably diplomat material. He has no wish to play
one side of the ideological fence against the other and, more
understandably perhaps, is anxious not to give the impression that he
disowns his East German upbringing.
He will allow that there were times after he went to Leverkusen that
he wishes he had done so earlier. ''East Berlin was also very nice, you
know, but there are some goods you can get in the West that we could not
get easily.
''For example, the only cars were the ones made in the East, but since
the unification, there have been hard things that I have not had to
suffer. There were little problems for me and my wife moving to the
West, but for the ordinary East German men and women, it was much worse
trying to cope with all the things that happened after unification. Many
people lost jobs there, for instance, and especially those over 50.
''I am happy that my mother and father, who are over 50, are still
doing their same jobs. So is my brother.'' One of the tough aspects of
moving to Scotland has been the separation from his roots in Germany,
but at least his mum and dad did get over to see him when he played his
first game for Celtic, and he hopes they'll be back at Christmas.
''I owe so much to my parents. In fact if they had not been so
supportive, I would not be sitting here talking to you now.''
Thom had just completed a training session, had been busy discussing
his new furniture with a company rep., and looked forward to moving into
the new house he has just bought. ''I have been given a very good
welcome and people are friendly, but it will be much better when we can
live in our home, not a hotel.''
He was not entirely ignorant of Celtic and their reputation when it
was first mooted that they were interested in taking him to Glasgow. ''I
knew they were a big club, and once I knew they were interested in me, I
made enquiries and read a lot about them. I would not have signed if I
had not been satisfied.''
He admits it is strange to come to a different country after spending
his career to date in the same country (or at least two halves of the
same country) but he has been shrewd enough to work out that if he does
his bit on the field, he gets all the friendlier treatment off it.
He also concedes that the Celtic fans' expectations make life tough.
''It is not possible to score every time I get the ball. Everything I
had been told about the way the fans love their football here has been
true.
''I am grateful for the welcome they have given me.'' The diplomacy
rushes to the fore again when he talks about the different styles of
football between here and Germany. ''It is very fast here, much quicker
than in Germany, but I had been told to expect kick and rush football,
but it is not like that.
''It is difficult to play at this speed, but there has been good
combination play as well.''
If he appears to have fitted in with some ease to the Parkhead side,
he would tell you that he has no idea why that should be. ''I have only
played for two other teams, Dinamo Berlin and Leverkusen, and I had no
problems there.
''I think it is important to settle in quickly for my sake and for the
team and well.''
Thom, who has been capped more than 50 times for East Germany, and is
one of the few from there since unification to have been capped by
Germany, still harbours hopes of returning to the national side, but he
believes first of all he will have to prove himself with Celtic, and
then see if he can get into a team that is in good form as always.
The prospect of European football was one of the main attractions that
brought him to Parkhead, and he would like to think the team will still
be involved in the Cup-winners' Cup after they take on Paris St Germain.
''I think Paris must be favourites for both legs but that means we can
go into the game with nothing to lose. I don't see why we cannot win.''
He reckons Raith Rovers have a much stiffer task, although he
recognises that they are not a bad team at all. ''Munich seem good
favourites,'' he adds, and considering that he keeps up with the
Bundesliga standard via satellite TV, he is in a position to judge.
His own ambitions are straightforward enough. ''I would like to do as
well as possible for Celtic, to do well in the league and cup, and see
what happens.''
First things first. He and his wife Kristina want to set up home for
their two children, Janine (7) and Sasha Rene (10 months). ''That will
make a big difference to our lives.''

HAMMY McMillan's Stranraer team had the best possible start yesterday
at the Lockerbie Invitation, the main curling event to be held in
Scotland this weekend.
In his opening game against Greenacres' Philip Wilson, McMillan won
4-2, and he followed that up with a more convincing 7-2 victory over
Robbie Dick, one of the home teams competing this weekend.
Tom Brewster, also from Lockerbie and reigning world junior champion,
had better fortune than Wilson, winning his opener 3-2, over Kenny
Murray's team.
Other winners from the first draw were John Muir, of Hamilton, Robin
Gray, of Forest Hills, and Grant McPherson, from Kilmarnock.
Later in the afternoon, former Scottish champion Colin Hamilton went
down 4-2 to Crawford Copstick, from Glasgow, to move down on to the 'B'
road, while Robin Gray recorded his second victory with a 6-2 win over
Jim Naismith, thereby setting himself up to face McMillan in his third
game.

THE routine will sound familiar to many housewives and mothers: finish
work; collect daughter from the nursery; home -- make evening meal; do
the dishes; put wean to bed; read the mandatory story -- The Lion King
for the twenty-third time; demolish a mountain of ironing. Then, at
last, lie down in front of the TV.
Blessed release.
Shirley McIntosh does all that. But when she lies down in front of the
telly of an evening, it is on the floor, cradling a gun. Just to the
left of the screen is a blank page of white paper, ripped from a
notebook, fixed with adhesive to the lounge wall of the family's
comfortable flat in Edinburgh's Goldenacre.
In the middle is a black spot, about the width of a pinkie nail -- 10
millimetres for the statistically inclined.
Nestling between the eternal silence of a graveyard, on one side, and
the grunt and thud of the Heriot's rugby pack, training on the other,
the only sound in the McIntosh household is the click of the firing pin.
Scotland's most deadly shot is also training. The only release is of the
trigger finger as Shirley attempts to become even more deadly.
Mrs McIntosh, a chartered accountant with Coopers and Lybrand during
the daytime, has metamorphosed, having shed the smart suit. The petite
29-year-old blonde's eyes narrow. Concentration is absolute.
Click.
There is no explosion, for there is no cartridge in the chamber of the
smallbore rifle. This dry firing, as it is called, seems a pointless
exercise to the uninitiated.
A world-class shot does not have to examine the target. More
practically, at #400 for 5000 rounds, it saves money going up in smoke.
And Shirley is certainly world class. She returned from last year's
Commonwealth Games in Victoria as the most successful competitor in the
whole Scotland team -- gold in the individual smallbore prone, silver
from the pairs prone, and only just missing bronze in the three-position
pairs event.
Last weekend, having switched to air weapons, shooting's winter
discipline, she claimed the Scottish women's open and confined air rifle
titles, and with her husband, Donald, took the club pairs.
They met at Edinburgh University, where Shirley began shooting --
apart from a handful of rounds she had fired while in the cadet corps at
Dollar Academy.
At the 1986 Commonwealth Games, just months into the sport, she was
escorting the Edinburgh medallists to the rostrum. ''I looked at these
women, and knew I could beat them,'' she said. Eight years later she was
on the top step herself.
Despite that, she will not pursue an Olympic place next year ''for
family reasons.'' Her company is generous with time off, and allows mums
to work part-time, but with a four-year-old daughter she says it is time
for her husband, Donald, a softwear engineer, to have the chance to
pursue his shooting aspirations.
''He eased off to let me concentrate on the Games,'' adds Shirley.
''We realised I had more chance of achieving something. Now it's his
turn.''
Come the next Commonwealth Games however, in Kuala Lumpur, when both
hope to be in the team, both sets of grandparents will be asked to help,
as they have done regularly in the past.
Shooting is a more demanding discipline than many would imagine.
Shirley's gun weighs just over 12lbs, with competitions lasting anything
from one and a half to two and a half hours. Try supporting five
one-kilo bags of sugar along the length of your arms for a fraction of
that time.
Hers is one of the few sports where men and women meet. Shirley
regularly competes against men, and if one can claim scalps in shooting,
then she has plenty male ones.
''I've had a few disgruntled grumps, though mostly it is good-natured.
The men wind each other up: 'See you got beaten by a woman.'''
What really amuses Shirley is that women may not use the same weapon
as men, the so-called free rifle, in closed competition. Men are allowed
many little devices which aid accuracy, and this has the ultimate effect
of keeping men's scores higher than those of women.
''Nobody has ever satisfactorily explained why these rules exist. The
doctor in charge of the international board has the absurd notion that
women are not physically capable of shooting the same weapon as men. But
I think it's because men are frightened that women will start beating
them.''
Surley not, Shirley?
Targets, however, are identical. At 50 metres, smallbore's 4[1/4]-inch
black target appears as small as that pinkie nail, which is the size of
the actual bull. In air rifle, shot from 10 metres, the bull's actual
size is one millimetre -- the same as the full stop at the end of this
sentence.
The pursuit of precision in the face of such fine margins persuades
many fullbore marksmen to manufacture their own ammunition, in the
belief that their quality control is superior to that of arms factories.
Though cost may have something to do with it. Shirley's bill for 10,000
rounds (an average year) is around #800. But a fullbore shot, like her
husband, can blow #400 on shells for one contest and its immediate
preparation.
The German national team is full time, salaried, with keep, equipment
and ammunition paid. Employers are reimbursed for a worker's absence in
the squad, for up to three years, with even pension contributions being
made up.
In Britain, Shirley cannot even get support for a new gun -- around
#1600. She has had the same one for 10 years. Its barrel is ''in a dire
state'' with no prospect of any assistance.

TITLE hopeful Colin McRae's chances of lifting the Asia-Pacific crown
will rest on fellow-Scot Richard Burns when the demanding 555 Hong
Kong-Beijing Rally gets under way today.
McRae is missing the world's toughest rally because it clashes with
the penultimate round of the world championship but he could still lift
the crown if Burns denies rival Kenneth Eriksson victory.
The Swedish driver will clinch the championship if he wins the
2300-mile rally when it finishes in China next Friday. Second place or
lower will set up a December showdown in Thailand with McRae.
''Last year we finished second behind Possum Bourne -- we had
instructions not to beat him,'' said Burns of his fellow Subaru driver,
who will be out for a second successive win.
''This year our only orders are to make sure that Colin goes to
Thailand with a chance of winning the Asia-Pacific title. We're happy to
oblige.
''The 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Rally is the most demanding event I have
ever contested. It combines long distances and punishing schedules with
high speed special stages which demand intense concentration.''
Burns, with co-driver Robert Reid, will be one of 49 teams in the
event which is expected to come down to a duel between Japanese giants
Subaru and the Mitubishi contingent of Eriksson and Ari Vatanen.
The rally, including 26 special stages, will take in some of the
remotest parts of the world before the finish in Tiananmen Square.

Antoni Burakowski from designers Antoni and Alison
* IN 1983 when I was still at college, Alison and I went to an auction
at Sotheby's for sixties gentleman's clothing.
The lot I wanted was a beautiful collection of gentlemen's jackets.
However, somehow I missed it and I went for the next lot which I hadn't
seen.
It ended up being a lot of ripped up belt buckles, a snotty hanky and
shredded ties that were awful and totally useless. I wanted to leave
them on the bus going home but they went straight into the bin anyway.

BOLTON have agreed a #1m deal to bring Yugoslav internationalist
midfielder Sasa Curcic to Burnden Park.
The 23-year-old Partisan Belgrade player must await a work permit, and
all being well, will make his debut in the home clash with Arsenal on
October 30.
Bolton have no new injury problems for today's home meeting against
Everton, with striker John McGinlay reporting fit after his outing for
Scotland against Sweden in midweek.
Another striker, former Dundee United man Mixu Paatelainen, out since
the start of the season with a hernia problem, scored on his comeback in
the reserves on Thursday night but is unlikely to figure today.
Chelsea also fixed up a leading foreign player yesterday when they
signed Sheffield Wednesday's Romanian internationalist Dan Petrescu for
#2.3m, with manager Glenn Hoddle finally landing the man he has been
tracking since the summer.
It has cost the Stamford Bridge club #1m more than former Wednesday
manager Trevor Francis paid Italian outfit Genoa for Petrescu a month
after his impressive performances for Romania in last year's World Cup
finals in America.
He cannot play for Chelsea until the Department of Employment grants
him a new work permit -- expected to take at least two weeks.
* REPUBLIC of Ireland striker Niall Quinn retains his place in
Manchester City's starting line-up for the local derby with Manchester
United at Old Trafford this afternoon.
Former Celt Gerry Creaney, who played up front for Scotland B in
midweek, is on the substitutes' bench as he has a slight hamstring
strain.
Eric Cantona and Roy Keane are both major doubts for United. Cantona
is having treatment for a knee injury, picked up in the reserve match
against Leeds last Saturday, while Keane is set to see a specialist
about a hernia problem.

Gerard Love from Teenage Fanclub
* I'VE been buying a lot of good music at the moment, but one of the
best is Stereolab's Refried Ectoplasm -- Switched On Vol 2. It's a
compiliation of outakes and B-sides which is surprisingly good though I
think that you've got to be a bit of a fan to like this. A lot of these
kinds of compilations can be pretty bad. We did one once and it was
rubbish. I'm not a massive fan having only seen them once but I
appreciate what they do. I felt that I had to buy this as I didn't buy
any of the singles when they first came out. It's kind of like space
music -- music of the future.

UNDER THE HAMMER
Liz Taylor finds exotic art and acrimony among artists in fascinating
sales with an Oriental flavour
THIS week we are making two forays into the East in search of romance.
Firstly, what was more romantic and glamorous than the Mughal Empire in
the seventeenth century? A portrait of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, who
reigned from 1605 till 1627, is currently causing a great deal of
excitement at Sotheby's who are due to put it up for auction in London
on October 18.
It is unusual in several respects, firstly because it is life size and
is the largest known Mughal painting on record. It measures one metre
square whereas portraits of other emperors that normally come onto the
market are small and precise, rather like manuscript illustrations.
Secondly, it is painted on cotton using a water-based medium and gold.
Mughal artists frequently painted on cotton during the preceding century
but by the time of Jahangir, this method had become comparatively rare.
Thirdly, it is a pioneering picture in that it seems to have been
influenced by European pictures which were then being introduced into
the Indian sub-continent. Jesuit missionaries first took paintings of
Christ and his saints, showing their divinity by the haloes painted
around their heads. This was copied by the Mughal artist Abdul Hasan,
Nadir al-Zaman, who painted Jahangir in 1617. Around the Emperor's head
there is a magnificent sunburst style halo.
The second type of European picture which influenced Indian artists at
that time were ''publicity'' portraits of royalty or very important
people which ambassadors presented to the Mughal court. Jahangir wanted
himself painted in this allegorical portrait tradition in order to give
some impression of his power and grandeur.
He certainly succeeded and in his portrait are various symbols
representing his glory. Apart from the halo; he is painted holding out
the globe to his successor, and is dressed in a costume which was
forbidden to anyone else in his court, specifically a sleeveless coat
called a nadiri, a Tus shawl, and a silken waistband woven with gold and
silver threads. His jewellery too is magnificent, ranging from a
necklace of pearls, rubies and emeralds, gold finger rings and golden,
jewelled braclets.
The furniture shown in the painting indicates trade with foreign
countries because the chair is Portuguese, the glass and wine bottle
Venetian and the table Chinese.
The portrait has been in the possession of a European noble family
since the mid-nineteenth century but is thought to have arrived in
Europe at least a century before that. Because of its beauty, grandeur
and rarity Sotheby's have placed an estimate on it of between #300,000
and #500,000. A princely price for a princely portrait.
The second foray into the East is with an up-till-now lesser known
artist called Mortimer Menpes. He was an Australian, born in Adelaide in
1860, who came to London to study art and struck up a friendship with
Whistler. Like many of Whistler's friendships, it was doomed to end in
acrimony.
Whistler taught Menpes the art of etching, an art which he practised
with great skill. While Whistler made his name by producing prints in
the Japanese style, he never visited Japan. Menpes however went there --
and to China, India, Damascus, Jerusalem, Beirut and Venice, producing
drawings of all his ports of call. When the artistic world began to take
notice of Menpes, Whistler reacted with peevish resentment and called
his ex-friend ''a kangaroo born with a pocket to put everything into
it''.
By 1880 Menpes had made his name, exhibited regularly at the Royal
Academy and was famous as an etcher and a portrait painter. However he
had a very bad drink problem which proved to be his downfall and he
ended his life in a mental asylum in Surrey in 1938.
On October 25, Sotheby's are selling a collection of 4000 prints by
Menpes which were bought as a huge lot by the grandfather of the present
vendor. It took the granddaughter five years to sort through all the
etchings which were stored in large packing cases in a room of her
house.
Most of the prints on offer are views of foreign places and they range
in price from around #200 to #1200. At those prices they represent very
good investments.
* MARKET NEWS: Early television and HMV re-entrant gramophones are
fetching rapidly rising prices in salerooms. Recently Phillips reported
#2300 paid for an HMV model 905 which comprised a seven-inch screen
television with a three band radio.
As far as gramophones are concerned, these are particularly popular in
the Far East, especially Korea. At the same sale as the television,
Phillips got a bid of #9500 for a HMV 202 re-entrant gramophone in an
elegant wooden case with a fretwork front.

IAN Rush, the Welsh and Liverpool striker, yesterday spoke for the
first time about the speculation surrounding his footballing future and
about his name being linked with Celtic, the club who provided the
opposition in his testimonial match.
Rush missed out on Wales' European Championship match with Germany in
Cardiff on Wednesday night because of a back injury, but he is fit again
and, despite suggestions that Stan Collymore will replace him against
Coventry at Anfield today, expects to play.
If, however, Collymore is preferred to the Welshman it will again
spark off talk that his days as a Liverpool player may be over.
Said Rush: ''Speculation, especially being linked with big clubs like
Celtic, is very flattering, and if Liverpool say I can go then they are
one of the clubs I would be interested in going to.
''I'm not unhappy at Liverpool and I've always said I didn't want to
leave, but if the club don't want me and decide I can go, then I would
certainly listen to anything Celtic had to say.
''I want to play for as long as I can, but I have not spoken to anyone
about the future. All I can do is make myself available for the match
against Coventry tomorrow.''
Liverpool manager Roy Evans has stated, quite clearly, that he is not
forcing Rush out of the door, but he also says that there may come a
time during the course of the season when the player decides himself
that he wants to move.
Said Evans: ''We are grateful to have Rush's experience at this time,
but, obviously, he has to fight for his place at Anfield like everyone
else.''
If Rush, however, loses his place to Collymore, signed during the
summer from Nottingham Forest, then, to get his wish of playing at the
top level for as long as he can, he could be on the move, and he hasn't
ruled out signing on at Parkhead.
* DERBY are set to recoup a large chunk of their #1.5m outlay on
Croatia captain Igor Stimac after agreeing to sell American
internationalist John Harkes for #500,000 to the United States Soccer
Federation.
Harkes, who cost Derby #800,000 from Sheffield Wednesday two years
ago, will play in the new American league next season.

All You Can Eat, k.d. lang (Warner Brothers)
* IT'S pretty easy to say what this album ain't. It ain't
Garth-Brooks-talks-through-his-hat country-pancake music, nosirree. It's
much harder to say exactly what it is -- other than quite gorgeous, of
course. It's an exercise in insinuation. It's cool and floaty, with
downbeat swoony moments that take your breath away. It's achy-breaky,
easy-oasy, fabby-dabby, dazzlingly k.d., and more than anyone can take
in at one sitting. Tuck in.
The Bloomsbury Theatre 12:3:95, Tindersticks (This Way Up)
* YOU were there when the night was ablaze with languor, elbow-length
black silk gloves, poetry, sexual potency, and soaring violins, weren't
you? Tindersticks at the Old Athenaeum, in Glasgow. Backed by a 27-piece
orchestra. March 10. I know it was you . . . I saw you, I'm sure. You
were in the front row, in a curiously-tailored outfit comprised of a
cape and green Donegal tweed plus-fours. You were sweating profusely and
mumbling to yourself as the intensity of the performance swept over you
with the inevitability of a lava-flow. As the music unfolded, drama
rippled through every bulky curve of your rather raddled body. During
the playing of Tiny Tears, your jowls pulsed with a palpable anguish
which was shared by the whole theatre. Your companion wore an ancient
brown leather all-in-one motorcycling suit, belted tightly at the waist
and complete with massive goggles which he or she never removed. Sobbing
copiously and holding hands all night, the pair of you were an
inspiration in gig-going, frankly. And so I will cherish this
unspeakably awesome live recording of the same concert programme two
nights later in London for many reasons, not the least of which is you,
you refulgent diamond of a human being, you! Tindersticks: file under
peculiarly brilliant.
Friendly Fire, Shara Nelson (Cooltempo)
* HER Supreme Hurting Voxfulness unleashes her long-awaited follow-up
to the sublime What Silence Knows. The big news is that she's gone a bit
more obviously melodic. Thus you're not kept on tenterhooks throughout
each song, wondering whether or not Shara's voice is going to reach
beyond its physical limitations and arrive at its intended destination,
ie. the ''right'' note. Everything is smoother, creamier, more
fully-rounded, more mellow. In consequence, more is lost than is gained
-- especially in the quality of the songs -- but this is still a
soul-fired throbber of an album.
Jesus Wept, P.M. Dawn (Gee Street)
* A BORN-AGAIN construction of thoroughly post-post-modern gospel-pop,
cleverly deploying a range of informed borrowings. While one song is
underpinned by the baroque punkiness of Deep Purple's Hush, others quote
from sources as disparate as Joni Mitchell, 808 State, Cal Tjader, the
Brian Auger Trinity and Three Dog Night. Rounding things off is an
eight-minute suite which melds Prince's 1999 with Talking Heads' Once In
A Lifetime. Add healthy dollops of wackoid freak-out guitar and you've
an album which will make you cry out with a joyous certainty: Holy
Guacamole, P.M. Dawn are righteous!
In Dub, Tappa Zukie (Blood and Fire)
* REVERBERANT ghostings from the summer of 1976. One of the essential
reggae re-issues of this, or indeed any other year.
Tower of Song: the Songs of Leonard Cohen, various (A&amp;M)
* YEAH, Glum Ol' Croaky-Gizzard he done some songs all right. Lots of
folk take them too seriously, though. Like novelist Tom Robbins whose
sleeve notes ooze silliness: ''Nobody can say the word 'naked' as
nakedly as Cohen.'' Bare-faced twaddle. ''He makes us see the markings
where the pantyhose have been.'' Eh? Likewise, most of the big names on
this tribute album perform Laffing Len's ouevre with po-faced reverence.
Thumbs down to Tori Almost . . . sorry, Amos; Elton John; Bono; Peter
Gabriel, and Billy Joel. Thumbs aloft to Suzanne Vega (for Story Of
Isaac) and especially Willie Nelson (Bird On The Wire), of whom it can
most truthfully be said that no-one says anything with the authenticity
that Willie Nelson can say it.

RANGERS' personal appeal to UEFA yesterday paid off with the reduction
of Alan McLaren's suspension from the original four games to three, a
decision that means the player will be free to take part in the home
meeting with Steaua Bucharest in the Champions' League next month.
The Ibrox club had sent McLaren and vice-chairman Donald Findlay to
Geneva to put the Rangers case after the Scottish international defender
had already served one of his four-game suspension after his automatic
absence following his ordering off against the Bulgarian team in
Bucharest.
They did a good job because, according to manager Walter Smith, the
most they had hoped for was what they achieved. McLaren had to sit out
the Borussia Dortmund match at Ibrox, but the Rangers case was that UEFA
were being excessive in adding a further three games to the ban.
They not only succeeded in that argument, no doubt due to some extent
to the eloquence of QC Findlay, but also have been told that a booking
against McLaren during the preliminary round against Anorthosis of
Cyprus was not now registered against his name. That would mean that the
player can relax a little when he does reappear, as under UEFA rules two
cautions mean an automatic suspension.
The former Hearts player would have been a valuable asset in the two
matches against Juventus, who are favourites to win the group,
especially as he has demonstrated on a number of international occasions
that he is adept at marking the opposition's No.1 danger man. Rangers
travel to Italy next week for the first of their two meetings with the
Italian champions.
Rangers will wait to see if another key man, Paul Gasgoigne, who has
gone down with flu to add discomfort to the injury that ruled him out of
England's game with Norway during the week, can be considered for a
return to the country where he last played.
McLaren, who played for Scotland in Sweden, will be in the Rangers
side against Partick Thistle at Firhill this afternoon.

<HEADLINE>Elkington once again is a match for Montgomerie</HEADLINE>

TRISKAIDEKAPHOBES, as everyone knows, are people who are afraid of the
number 13, and since yesterday also was a Friday, the risk of fear was
presumably compounded for those affected by the wilder irrationalities
of superstition. They did not include the four survivors in the Toyota
World Matchplay Golf Championship.
In glorious autumn sunshine at Wentworth, Steve Elkington was again
the Nemesis of Colin Montgomerie, whom he defeated by 2 and 1,
comparable to the first hole play-off victory the Australian gained over
the Scot for the US PGA Championship title two months ago, and he will
face Italy's Costantino Rocca, who by 3 and 2 tasted victory over the US
Masters champion, Ben Crenshaw, for the second time in three weeks.
In the upper half of the draw, the South African holder Ernie Els came
through by 4 and 3 over Lee Janzen, another former US Open champion, and
in the first semi-final he will meet Germany's Bernhard Langer, who by
one hole defeated another previous beaten finalist, Nick Price, in a war
of attrition in character with their golf.
Unaccustomed as professionals are to man-to-man combat, there was some
evidence of the condition in cricket known as the Nervous Nineties. Just
like a batsman trembling with bravery in sight of his century so Els,
six up after 20 holes, and Rocca, eight up at the same stage, were both
taken further than they would have preferred.
Elkington was over par just once in 35 holes to be 10 under, and
Montgomerie, eight under himself, simply had as he later said: ''Met the
wrong man at the wrong time. It's difficult to beat someone playing that
well.''
There were two key passages in their match. Montgomerie missed from
six feet to birdie the sixteenth in the morning and lead, then lost the
last two holes to birdie 4s to lunch two down. Although Montgomerie
squared over the next four holes, Elkington, in control of his
impressively fluent and rhythmical swing, had regained his two-hole
advantage by the turn. Montgomerie then covered the next four holes in
three under, but since Elkington also did, no advance was made.
When Elkington hit his tee-shot dead at the short tenth Montgomerie
responded to three feet to halve. Montgomerie birdied the next to win,
both did so at the long twelfth, and with Montgomerie safely home in two
at the next, Elkington chipped in from 45 feet for a winning birdie.
Never one to hold back on the shorter putts, Montgomerie lost the
fifteenth, where both were bunkered. But whereas Elkington came out to
two feet Montgomerie recovered to six feet and his putt for the half
completed the circumference of the hole back to him.
Having hit ''too many rims'' in the match Montgomerie's last, but too
late, throw of the dice was, ironically, a putt of 30 feet at the
sixteenth.
The Rocca of two years ago might have crumbled completely at the
steady erosion of such a substantial lead. But victories and consistency
have enhanced experience.
Rocca was round in 67 to 74 in the morning to be seven up, eliciting
the wry comment from Crenshaw's fellow Texan and television commentator,
Dave Marr: ''After you're done I want to read your book on the art of
matchplay.'' Aided by some poor shots of Rocca's and birdies of his own
Crenshaw ''at least made a game of it.''
Just as Elkington began to take a grip of his game at the end of the
first round, so the tide began to turn towards Langer at that stage. He,
too, won the last two holes in birdie 4s from Price, in his case to
square and go into lunch in a more positive frame of mind.
That was confirmed when Langer, painstaking as always, took the lead
for the first time by winning the first afternoon hole in par, and
although he took three putts to lose the long fourth, putts of 12 and 20
feet for birdie 3s at the seventh and ninth gave him a two-hole lead to
take into the last nine holes.
That he was hunted by Price to the end was only to be expected.
Els's game showed not the slightest sign of rustiness after he had
played only one tournament in five weeks. He went round in 64, eight
under, as he did last year in the first round against Seve Ballesteros,
although he was only two up on the Spaniard, not five up as on this
occasion. Indeed, in 33 holes Els strayed over par only once.
So dominated was Janzen that he took only six holes -- and half of
these in a flurry of exchanges over the last half-dozen holes of the
match. Suddenly the putters of both players sprang to life, but the
American's two long-range efforts and a No.5-iron shot to five feet for
an eagle 3 at the 483-yard twelfth were too late to affect the ultimate
result. Results:
E Els (S Africa) beat L Janzen (USA), 4 and 3; B Langer (Germany) beat
N Price (Zimbabwe), 1 hole; S Elkington (Australia) beat C Montgomerie
(Scotland), 2 and 1; C Rocca (Italy) beat B Crenshaw (USA), 3 and 2.
TODAY'S TEE-OFF TIMES
8.30 and 1.0 -- E Els v B Langer; 8.45 and 1.15 -- S Elkington v C
Rocca.

Music for Loving -- Ben Webster With Strings (Verve)
* VERVE is currently hosting the jazz sale of the century with its
Take 2 series of double CDs. This double contains reissues of not two
albums, but three: Music with Feeling and Music For Loving -- both with
tenor saxophonist Ben Webster -- and Harry Carney With Strings. Webster
was the perfect choice to record with strings: his status as one of
jazz's greatest balladeers is confirmed by every one of his (30) tracks,
and his insistence that he know all the lyrics to the ballads he played
clearly paid off. This is real late-night listening for lovers -- a gem
of a collection. Who could resist the charms of the silky smooth Love Is
Here To Stay; the dreamy Prelude to a Kiss or the sublime Under a
Blanket of Blue (with Teddy Wilson on piano). The Carney tracks are
fitting companion pieces. In all, a sumptuous selection and a must for
anyone who loves romance.

DREW Docherty and Jim Murray put on one of the greatest fights seen in
Glasgow in modern times last night, with Docherty from Condorrat
retaining his British bantamweight championship with a dramatic knockout
after 2min 26sec of the twelfth and final round.
But hundreds in the Hospitality Inn, and millions more watching on Sky
TV, were sickened and stunned by the events which followed. As Murray
lay on the canvas covered in blood and in obvious distress following a
right hand to the head from the champion, a section of his supporters
sparked off a riot and caused utter mayhem.
With paramedics and doctors attending the injured fighter, a hail of
bottles, glasses, and chairs were thrown towards the ringside. Fights
broke out at the back of the hall and other fans fled in terror. Despite
calls from MC Mike Goodall for order, the riot continued, with security
men and then police eventually moving in to restore some kind of order.
Murray, from Newmains, was taken to hospital and Docherty, who had
made his third successful defence of the title, was led out of a side
door past weeping women and was later given a police escort along with
his handlers away from the venue.
Said his manager Tommy Gilmour: ''What a shocking night for boxing,
and it was shocking that there were no police in the hall during the
fight.''
Docherty sat slumped in his hotel room and said: ''What can I say?
What a way for it all to end. It was bad for boxing. We had put on a
great fight and we only hope that Jim is all right.''
It certainly was not the way for any fan who claims to love the sport
to treat two of the bravest little men in the business. Both had given
it everything, and then a bit more, with the fight going one way and
then the other.
The challenger took all the early honours, looking confident and
pumped up for the job. Murray floored the champion for a count of three
in the first round with a straight right and dominated the opening
rounds with sheer aggression.
Docherty, however, showed just how good a champion he is. He pulled
himself together and opened up a cut at the side of Murray's eye in the
third. In the sixth Murray sustained another bad gash, this time on the
bridge of his nose, but he still kept coming forward, trying to make his
power tell.
The champion also was bleeding around the nose and the action was
non-stop.
Docherty went down again from a left hand at the start of the seventh
but he got to his feet, settled himself, and eventually made his
superior boxing tell, relying on a razor-sharp left jab and continually
reopening the cuts around the challenger's nose and eyes.
Murray, so brave, was reduced to almost walking pace in the final two
rounds but just when it looked as though the referee, John Keene, would
have to score the fight, Docherty suddenly exploded a right to the
challenger's head and he went down as if pole-axed. It was the first
time Murray had been dropped in his career, but he never looked like
beating the count.
Now Docherty will concentrate on challenging England's Johnny Armour
for the European and Commonwealth titles. He was the winner last night
but the only loser was Scottish boxing. After such horrific scenes, who
would want to come and perform here?
Brian Carr, the former ABA featherweight champion from Moodiesburn,
survived blatant head butts in the first two rounds of his contest to go
on and maintained his unbeaten record against Muhammed Shaffique, of
Huddersfield, with a comprehensive points win over six bloody rounds.
The young Scot was cut on the bridge of the mose and over his left eye
in those opening rounds but came storming back to outpower his opponent,
causing serious damage to the nose which at times threatened to cause an
early stoppage. Referee Len Mullen was spot-on in judging Carr the
winner of every round.
Renfrew lightweight Alan McDowell, whose only previous defeat as a
professional was against Walsall's Peter Till, gained sweet revenge when
he stopped the same man after 2min 13sec of the fifth round, although
Till complained that referee Al Hutcheon had halted the fight
prematurely.
McDowell threw punches from all angles and hurt the Englishman with
body shots before dropping him for a count of seven early in the fifth.
When Till got to his feet, the Scot stormed in again, throwing punches
to the body, and when Till was trapped on the ropes, the referee stopped
the contest.
Scott Dixon, the 18-year-old featherweight from Hamilton, made a
successful professional debut with a snappy and confident four-rounds
points win over Andrew Smith, of Nuneaton, who just couldn't find a way
inside the gangling Scot's left jab.

Jack Murray laments the loss of the living fire and its magic glow on
a cold winter's night
THEY look good but don't feel good, not the way a real coal fire does.
Imitation fires don't have a lum. They are alive as a dead chicken. They
are without sound or spark and they make lousy toast. There's nothing
like a nice piece of coal-fired toast.
Their imitation mahogany, or real marble surrounds adorned with
high-relief Grecian urns, do not a fire make. There is no feel-good
factor. The living flame beloved by gas consumers gets a little closer.
No more. Even the real coal fire behind its special glass doors doesn't
carry the dominating authority or luxury of a real open coal fire.
If you are lucky enough to have one you'll know coal fires are magic.
With the enthusiasm of a child it welcomes you home, and gives you a
warm sensuous feeling of comfort and peace.
The low hum of rotor blades spinning above the glow-bulbs of the
two-bar electric fire, snug in its imitation surrounds and with its
imitation coal, fools nobody. There's no lum. No magic, and they don't
make memories.
The coal fire was very important in our house with us kids. In the
morning we jumped from our warm beds to shiver on the uncompromising
cold linoleum. The grate, filled with the bleak grey ashes of yesterday,
encouraged our shivers.
If the coal bunker had only a little dross left from the last bag of
coal it meant a search through cupboards for discarded shoes and other
burnable material. The fire was started with yesterday's papers, quickly
collected and wrung into long paper sticks by my sister. The worn-out
shoes were piled high on top of the paper sticks. It didn't take long
before a fire of sorts was burning, its white flames cool but welcome.
The thick black smoke from the rubber shoes billowed up the chimney
and, luckily, the putrid smell followed it.
The fine flakes of soot hidden in the smoke poured from the rooftop
chimney to pollute the air. There was no Clean Air Act then. We shivered
a few times more before a little glow of warmth was felt from the
flickering flames.
There were some great fires in this little grate on the days we had
coal. It was then that we spent hours on cold winter days eating toast
made with a long, three-pronged wire fork. Plain-loaf bread soaked in
butter made the best toast.
To save coal we bought briquettes from ''Wee Dobbie'', a miniature man
forever grey-faced beneath his too large bunnet, his greyness the
trademark of his one-man business: chimney sweep and briquette seller.
His worn leather moneybag, filled with gleaming silver halfcrowns,
shillings, and sixpences, hung heavy over his shoulder. The briquettes,
still hot, steamed in their neat rows on his cart. The little brown pony
silent, head down, contemplative, waiting for the liquid ''click!
click!'' from its master. The sign to move on.
''Bree---- kets Ohee, Bree---- kets,'' he called to the faithful in
their rows of tenements. His briquettes helped coat the chimneys with
soot that he later cleaned, a kind of self-perpetuating living.
The Dobbies have all but gone. The demise of the open coal fire and
the Clean Air Act helped to give us a better environment and certainly
got rid of the great winter smog. But, alas, a little of the magic has
gone too.
But all is not lost. Some brave souls out there are prepared to suffer
the daily clean-out of dusty ashes from smokeless fuel to keep their
open coal fires. They suffer this inconvenience and forgo the pleasure
of instant heat from gas or electricity for the sake of that magic glow
that only a coal fire can give when it welcomes you home on a cold
winter's night. My fate is to live in a modern house. They didn't build
a lum.

MY LAST GOOD BUY
Fish -- rock singer
* WE were over in Istanbul doing an open air concert so I thought that
I'd go and buy a carpet in one of those 600-year-old bazaars. Next thing
I knew I was three floors up and all these guys started to haggle and
bring out cups of tea.After two hours I ended up buying this humungous
carpet and my legs were shaking. This was because of the amount of money
I'd spent, and I didn't even know if this carpet would fit in our room
at home or if I'd have to build an extension. When it did arrive two
months later I had to leave it lying in the porch for a few hours
because I was so scared. However, it's beautiful and it's the best thing
that I've bought in a very long time.

MARI STEVEN -- Chartbite presenter
* THIS was when I went snowboarding to Lake Tahoe in California. It
was a really cheap fly-drive holiday that entailed stopping off in San
Francisco for a few days where we visited all those places in The Tales
Of The City books. I had taken a few snowboarding lessons in Scotland
before I went there but I had to spend one full day throwing myself
non-stop down a mountain to really get the hang of it. It was just so
exhilarating and you don't even hurt yourself when you fall because the
snow is so powdery. They put a lot of money into their ski runs; they
were like something out of a James Bond movie.

If it's a case of bed and bore 3-D, with its extra dimension on
living, offers some exciting new ideas to sleep on this winter.
Singleberths
* JUST a hint of the traditional can be found in Habitat's otherwise
clean-lined Charleston single bed.
In tubular steel, with anthracite finish, it costs #349.
Available from branches at 140/160 Bothwell Street, Glasgow; and 32
Shandwick Place, Edinburgh.
* QUEEN Victoria slept here? Perhaps not, but this restored cast-iron
and brass bedstead is contemporaneous. Measuring 3ft x 6ft 3in, it costs
#481 at Huckleberry, 4 Stafford Street, Edinburgh. (Base #110 extra.)
Larger Victorian originals also available.
* HI-TECH meets high price in super-luxurious Royal Auping Dutch
custom-made beds, ranging from #1500 to #5600. Multi-stage heating and
climate control will ensure you never have sleepless nights worrying
about the cost of the top range Komfortabel model.
At the touch of a button motors adjust to a myriad of positions.
The bed of your dreams can be seen at the SECC Modern Homes
Exhibition, Glasgow until October 22.
Suite with
a secret
* THE aristocratic five foot Le Chateau is every inch a lit bateau,
rather than your common or garden bed.
Fashioned from cherry wood in distressed Champagne, Armagnac or Cognac
hand-waxed finish, it costs #2500 from And So To Bed, at Linens Fine, 22
Howe Street, Edinburgh.
To complete the bedroom suite, matching two-drawer chest is #1500 and
bedside cabinet #550, both with secret drawer.
Swinging
slumber
* PUT unexpected guests UP for the night -- literally -- with this
hammock from Bangladesh. Let them laze about the lounge-room, or on warm
nights out under the trees and the stars.
Proceeds from the #27.95 benefit the women's co-operative who weave it
from jute.
Doubles as an outdoor eyrie for swinging summers. From One World Shop,
St John's Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh.

FIRST DIVISION
IT'S the perfect partnership to give Dundee United the goals they need
-- ex-Ranger Gary McSwegan and yesterday's #400,000 signing from Bolton,
Owen Coyle. The Tannadice side's biggest problem as they try to climb
back up to the premier division in one season has been hitting the back
of the net.
Manager Billy Kirkwood will field his new strike-force against St
Johnstone -- ironically, they have been struggling in the goals for
department as well -- at Tannadice today.
It has been a long chase for Kirkwood since he took over at United. He
admitted: ''I have wanted Owen Coyle here since Day One. In April, when
I first asked, I was told he was not available. He then became a vital
member of Bolton's squad when they won the play-offs to reach the
Premiership, and that again ruled out a deal.
''Owen has proved himself at every level he has played, and the first
job here is for him to form a partnership with Gary McSwegan. I am sure
they will bring us the goals to get us back into the premier division.
Coyle insisted: ''I have been able to score goals wherever I have
played. I feel I am a far better player after my spell in England.''
United immediately spent another #35,000 -- a Highland League record
-- on Fraserburgh striker Marino Keith as one for the future.
Meanwhile, the top two in the first division square up at East End
Park. Dunfermline and Dundee each have hit the net 17 times in eight
games in the league so far this season and it prompted the Fifers'
manager, Bert Paton, to insist: ''There will be goals in this match.''
He was not predicting who would score more. The cynics would say that is
the perfect recipe for a 0-0 result.
One boost for Dunfermline is that striker Hamish French came through a
tough reserve match against Dundee United at the beginning of the week
and is, as the saying goes, ''feeling no pain.''
He will beef up the front line against a side still missing the
influential Dusan Vrto. Dundee manager Jim Duffy remarked: ''It goes
without saying that most first division supporters will want us to win
to try to peg back the eight-point gap Dunfermline already have opened
up. We want a consistent run of victories. Raith Rovers proved last
season that it could be done, and look where they are now.''
Elsewhere, Airdrie entertain a lively Clydebank side which has the
so-called veteran striker Ken Eadie back and hungry for more goals.
Airdrie have Jimmy Sandison and Sean Sweeney suspended, but bring in
Stephen Tait, Tom McIntyre, Marvin Wilson, and Gordon Connelly.
St Mirren have not had the best of weeks -- being turned over by
Morton last Saturday and then the Barry Lavety situation. Manager Jimmy
Bone has been trying to conduct business as normal, signing centre back
Paul Fenwick from Dunfermline for ''a nominal fee.'' The added factor of
having around a dozen players injured means that, as usual, the Paisley
young brigade will have to do the business against viitors Dumbarton.
Morton, who lost at Clydebank last week, face a Hamilton side who had
to concede to Dunfermline. Morton have the confidence, but if Hamilton
manager Iain Munro can lift his side, there could be fun at Cappielow
today.
In this first division, anything is possible.

HAMMY McMillan's Stranraer team had the best possible start yesterday
at the Lockerbie Invitation, the main curling event to be held in
Scotland this weekend.
In his opening game against Greenacres' Philip Wilson, McMillan won
4-2, and he followed that up with a more convincing 7-2 victory over
Robbie Dick, one of the home teams competing this weekend.
Tom Brewster, also from Lockerbie and reigning world junior champion,
had better fortune than Wilson, winning his opener 3-2, over Kenny
Murray's team.
Other winners from the first draw were John Muir, of Hamilton, Robin
Gray, of Forest Hills, and Grant McPherson, from Kilmarnock.
Later in the afternoon, former Scottish champion Colin Hamilton went
down 4-2 to Crawford Copstick, from Glasgow, to move down on to the 'B'
road, while Robin Gray recorded his second victory with a 6-2 win over
Jim Naismith, thereby setting himself up to face McMillan in his third
game.

SECOND DIVISIONS
CARETAKER manager Gordon Dalziel, still seeking to take charge of Ayr
United on a permanent basis, seems to be succeeding in his priority task
of tightening up the defence.
It is a change of emphasis for the veteran striker, whose reputation
has been established by scoring goals for Rangers and Raith Rovers. Ayr
have shut out the opposition in their past three matches but with only
one goal scored in that time there is plenty of work to be done before
they can expect to gather the points three at a time for victories.
The restless fans of Somerset Park are desperate to see a first home
win this season but it will not be easy today against Stenhousemuir, for
whom defender Graeme Armstrong will be reaching the milestone of 750
league appearances.
Steve Archibald's East Fife are leaders by five points and have an
eight-point cushion over the third-placed sides. The Fifers have maximum
points at Methil, and Alex Smith's Clyde, although unbeaten away from
home, will not want to lose ground today. Second-placed Berwick will
expect to collect three points away to winless Montrose and the
Borderers would then be three wins ahead of Clyde if the Cumbernauld
team return pointless from Fife.
Kevin Drinkell wants his Stirling Albion players to show that last
week's six-goal romp at Forfar was no fluke. Albion entertain lowly
Queen of the South, while Tommy Campbell's Forfar have a hard job to get
back on the rails as they have to visit Stranraer, who now share third
place with them.

DISPATCH FROM THE FRONT
Michael Fry sees the FRench court sit up and take notice of Charles's
success - and start to hatch plans to enter the fray on his side
PARIS, October 14 -- Louis XV, King of France, yesterday entered into
formal alliance with Prince Charles Edward Stuart, recognising him as
''Regent of the Kingdom of Scotland'' and promising him military aid. A
treaty between them was signed at the palace of Fontainebleau, 50 miles
south of the French capital, where the king is in residence for the
hunting season. The signatories were his Foreign Minister, the Marquis
de Voyer d'Argenson, and Colonel Denis O'Brien, representative in France
of the Stuart pretender, James VIII.
This is a vote of confidence in Charles, a swift pay-off for victory
at Prestonpans and a proof of French good faith which will be of use to
him against doubters in his own camp. At the start of his rising, the
Government in Paris took the official line that this was a personal
initiative of his own, which would have let it ditch him in case of
failure. The move to open support for the Jacobites marks an important
change of policy.
It had seemed in the offing when France started sending supplies to
Charles earlier this month. Four frigates sailed from Dunkirk to
Montrose bringing volunteers and arms. One of them also carried
Alexandre de Boyer, Marquis d'Eguilles, as envoy to Holyrood. He had
orders not to commit France to anything, however, but to make an
on-the-spot assessment of the rising's prospects of success.
Before he had time to file his first report, the news of Prestonpans
was brought to Paris this week by the prince's own envoy, George Kelly.
It caused elation at the king's court. In changing policy as a result,
Louis XV's ministers may be guilty not so much of deviousness as of
uncertainty. Used to the leisurely pace of continental warfare, they
have probably been wrongfooted by the prince's boldness and the
unexpected success of his lightning tactics.
At any rate they now feel they are winning the war against Britain and
her allies, which has gone on for two years without decisive advantage
to either side. Sources at the court say that Louis XV sees the chance
of snatching quick victory by an invasion of England. It could be headed
by the pretender's second son, Prince Henry, reported to be on his way
from Rome to Paris. The king's plan divides his ministers, who recall
that an attack by 15,000 troops under the Marshal de Saxe had to be
called off in the spring of 1744 because of bad weather.
But Britain has meanwhile been put on the defensive, and a serious
threat to the George II's crown, even to the whole Hanoverian dynasty,
cannot be ruled out. The king hurried back from organising military
operations in his German territories at the end of August, but so far
nothing has gone his way. The war, though sparked off by the disputed
succession to the throne of Austria, has mainly been fought in Flanders.
From there much of the British army has had to be withdrawn, leaving the
province at French mercy. An assault on Brussels seems imminent.
With control of Scotland lost too, war looms on two fronts. Prince
Charles is likely to cross the Border as soon as he recruits the 5000
men he needs to do so. General George Wade is marching from London up to
the east coast with a hastily mustered force to attack Scotland, which
he knows well from having built the military roads in the Highlands. The
Duke of Cumberland is also about to leave Flanders, to take command of a
second army covering the western side of England.
The Treaty of Fontainebleau will therefore be eagerly scanned at
Westminster for what it reveals of French intentions. Analysts here
point out that it leaves some important questions in the air.
It promises friendship, good neighbourliness and alliance between the
French Crown and ''the states which have accepted or will accept the
Regency of the Royal Prince Charles Edward Stewart''. On the military
side, it undertakes ''to assist him to this end in all possible ways''.
It spells out that, for the time being, this means sending the Irish
Brigade of the French army to Scotland to be placed under the prince's
orders. The brigade is about 6000 strong and so, if successfully landed,
would more than double the size of the forces which he hopes to raise
locally. Also at Louis XV's disposal is the newly formed Royal Scots
Regiment, a unit of 1000 mercenaries under Jacobite officers, commanded
by Lord John Drummond, brother of the Duke of Perth.
But the treaty does not make clear how far the prince's conquest of
the whole British Isles is to be supported. It could be read as applying
just to Scotland. Louis XV's real purpose may be to restore James VIII
only as King of Scots, so breaking the Union of 1707 and leaving England
weakened. This would conflict with the declared aim of Prince Charles to
reconquer not only Scotland but also England and Ireland for his father.
The ambiguous impression is reinforced by an article binding the two
parties ''to work together and in harmony for the restoration of peace
on a basis which can be of reciprocal advantage to the two nations''. It
adds that, after the end of the war, a commercial treaty between them is
to be concluded. But this would hardly be swallowed by the powerful
commercial interests of London, which have been beating French
competitors in global markets and want to keep their business at home
and overseas to themselves.
The treaty makes no mention of colonial concessions, though these
would certainly be demanded in the event of French victory in the war.
* Another dispatch next week.

LIVINGSTON, the only team unbeaten in the league, are in danger today
when the leaders play host to Brechin. Jim Leishman's men have a 100%
home record but second-placed City have a similar boast in away matches.
Ross County generally get the better of Alloa, who today have home
advantage but Kenny Hannah is missing through suspension. Cowdenbeath
have defender Brian Malloy banned for the visit to Caley Thistle, who
are beginning to get their act together with 12 goals in their past
three games.
Queen's Park will make their fifth attempt to collect an away point

Albion Rovers are seeking a hat trick of wins as they entertain East
Stirlingshire. Rovers' John Gallagher sits out after a red card last

AT that good food haven and rural retreat The Country Club,
Strathblane, October 20 promises to be a Friday night to remember. A
five-course gourmet dinner plus coffee and petits fours, including
dancing to the traditional jazz sounds of Rive Gauche, is on special
offer at #25. To ensure enjoyment of the premier league quality of both
meal and music telephone 01360 770491 for reservations.
The Country Club Hotel, in its idyllic woodland setting -- floodlit by
night -- is easily accessible by road from the centre of Glasgow and is
only a few minutes away from Milngavie ScotRail station by taxi.
A late Victorian mansion with parkland grounds, designed for a Glasgow
industrialist The Country Club affords magnificent views of the Campsies
and the rolling Stirlingshire countryside. The impressive dining room
with its period prints, art nouveau dado and crisp napery and fresh
flowers on every table is an aesthetic experience not to be missed.
Parking presents no problem; special weekend room rates are available on
request.
Up and coming Austrian chef Adi Schmid, already well known in the west
of Scotland, has created a mouth-watering menu for the occasion. Boned
and roast quail on a bed of autumn leaves with orange and juniper berry
dressing with celeriac chips is a very tempting starter. Medallion of
roast codling wrapped in smoked ham, served on spinach and garlic
noodles with creamed leeks and fillet of lamb baked in a herb crust with
wild mushrooms and a barley risotto in red wine sauce and thyme jus are
intriguing main courses. A trio of chocolate desserts and orange ice
cream complete the carte.
On The Country Club's new wine list there are some noteworthy, well
chosen bottles. Ace Australian winemaker James Herrick has produced a
stunning Chardonnay in southern France. His Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc
is a beaut. Chilean ''White Wine of the Year'' Casa Blanca Sauvignon
Blanc can be recommended unreservedly and California's Fetzer Fume blanc
should go down well with organic wine buffs. Among the reds, reliable
Guigal Cotes du Rhone is well worth a try and Genus Pinotage 1993 from
South Africa is full bodied value for money. Cuvee Napa Brut from
California's happy valley is a sparkler of finesse.
The prix fixe dinner nightly is #20 well spent. Sunday lunch at
#13.50, is a bargain. With Christmas just around the corner and Hogmanay
not far behind The Country Club is taking bookings for Christmas lunch,
Christmas dinner and the festive Christmas party menu for groups of 10
and over. Starting on December 11 they cost #12.50, #15.50 and #23 per
person. There are two sittings for Christmas Day dinner at #42 and the
Hogmanay dinner dance is #47 per reveller.

SCOTLAND captain Gary McAllister, injured in Scotland's defeat by
Sweden in Stockholm on Wednesday night, has convinced Leeds United
manager Howard Wilkinson that he has an outside chance of making today's
Premiership clash with Arsenal at Elland Road.
McAllister was a late addition to the squad yesterday after initial
fears that the ankle injury would keep him out for up to six weeks.
Leeds were furious when McAllister was carried off in the second half
of the friendly international after Scotland manager Craig Brown had
promised to play him in the first half only.
Wilkinson must now decide whether to risk McAllister before Tuesday's
UEFA Cup second round, first-leg tie against PSV Eindhoven.
Goalkeeper John Lukic clocks up his 400th Leeds appearance against his
old club today, while Tony Dorigo (thigh), John Pemberton (hamstring),
and Noel Whelan (shoulder) have all recovered from injuries.
* PREMIERSHIP champions Blackburn Rovers yesterday afternoon completed
the signings of Scotland internationalist Billy McKinlay and Norwegian
World Cup star Lars Bohinen.
Both McKinlay, a #1.75m capture from Dundee United, and Bohinen, a
#750,000 arrival from Nottingham Forest, will be included in Blackburn's
squad for the Premiership home date with Southampton at Ewood Park
today.
The signings end a hectic couple of weeks for under-pressure Rovers
manager Ray Harford, who has made nationwide moves to strengthen a
Blackburn squad that has made a disappointing start to the Premiership
title defence.
Whether Harford chooses to give both new players a debut today remains
to be seen, but the arrival of two international midfield men casts a
doubt over the places of skipper Tim Sherwood and England ace David
Batty.

VIDEO
LITTLE ODESSA (rental, cert 18).
* ALTHOUGH few actors can wave an automatic pistol around with more
authority than Tim Roth, anyone renting this downbeat, minor-key
thriller in hopes of finding the same kind of excitement as in Reservoir
Dogs and Pulp Fiction is in for heavy-calibre disappointment.
Roth gives his usual strong-to-psychopathic performance as
gangster-hitman Joshua, and the unusual (for a modern gangster movie)
setting and storyline allow him to broaden his range and do the
sensitivity thing, but in the end the setting and the story seem to work
much better than the film as a whole.
Roth is the black sheep of a respectable, hard-working Russian-Jewish
(hence the title) family in New York's Brighton Beach district, exiled
by his father (a great performance from Maximilian Schell) but still
loved by his dying mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and kid brother (Edward
Furlong). Forced back on to their turf by a strictly-business murder
assignment for a Russian Mafia gang, he finds it impossible to keep them
out of his business and has to protect them as well as himself from
being murdered by rival hoods.
The expected mayhem comes along as advertised, but the second half of
the film never makes the most of its set-up, and things fizzle out
confusingly in a straggle of abandoned sub-plots and who-killed-whom
uncertainties. Couch Potato gets the feeling that a little more time,
money, and experience could have made Little Odessa a much bigger film.
SFW (rental, cert 18).
* MUCH compared, mostly to its advantage, with Oliver Stone's Natural
Born Killers, Jefery (sic) Levy's grungy, Slacker-generation black
comedy (the S stands for So and the W stands for What?) pulls a cute
trick by simultaneously spoofing the earlier film and being a better
film on the same theme -- ie. the nature of fame and the American
media's values-free greed for personalities.
Our foul-mouthed and generally unlovable lunkhead hero Cliff Spab
(Stephen Dorff) comes to national adulation by being a 36-day hostage in
a convenience store held up by terrorists who record the siege on video.
But when he finally gets out, he discovers that the embrace of the media
is a whole lot less fun than being holed up with four nutcases in a
Seven-Eleven. Cliff soon discovers that once you're a hero, nothing you
can do or say can stop you being one. SFW won't be everyone's cup of
tea, but at heart it's a humane and righteously satirical piece of work.
DUMB AND DUMBER (rental, cert 12).
* COUCH POTATO -- with great misgivings, having seen the trailers --
checked out this Jim Carrey/Jeff Daniels comedy on the basis that
umpty-million ticket-buyers and critics can't be wrong. They can.
This 90-minute onslaught of sub-puerile jokes about bodily functions
and stupidity is the most witless, charmless, brainless, heartless, and
depressing film we ever saw in our life -- and that's out of about 5000.
The certificate ought to specify 12 as the maximum age of viewer rather
than the minimum.; and Couch Potato apologises in advance to all the
under-12s who may be offended by the suggestion that they'd like it.

TWO of the most admired players in the country, Ally McCoist of
Rangers and Paul McStay of Celtic, will be the subject of decisions by
their respective managers today which could determine whether or not
they are on the park next midweek helping the Old Firm cause in one of
the most important European weeks for many years.
McStay has been absent for the past couple of games after having
returned following two operations during the summer, but he is just
about ready to take his place again.
McCoist, who had to be omitted from the league game against Aberdeen
last week, is also fit and rarin' to get back into the fold and, like
McStay, loves the prospect of the big-time European scene.
Managers Tommy Burns and Walter Smith have to give a lot of thought to
each of their star turns, for similar reasons. Neither wants to spoil
the recovery process by rushing his man into the serious fray when a
little longer on the sidelines would be the better course, but against
that, the benefit of a game today would be considerable in each case if
they were to turn out against European opposition next midweek.
McStay has been in full training for the last couple of days, and was
very close to being selected last week against Partick Thistle, but the
Parkhead management admits to having pushed him a little too quickly
when he returned from a long absence last month. The result of a hectic
spell of five matches in 10 days was a groin strain and neither Burns
nor his assistant, Billy Stark, wants to risk further damage.
However, the Celtic captain is a quick healer, and also a hard man to
keep back when he is eager to get going, and it is likely he will be in
the side to meet Hibernian at Parkhead.
Said Stark: ''He is feeling better in himself and we will have a check
on him in the morning.''
Stark pointed out that, on the whole, their six games (including two
cup-ies) against Hibs last season were not only close, but entertaining,
and he anticipates something similar.
''Having gone to Ibrox and won, they will feel confident that they can
do the same here.''
Stark would settle for the performance level of the side this term
with the bonus of taking more of the chances created, but he is not the
only manager who would go for that option. Stark, along with David Hay,
will be heading for France tonight to see Paris St Germain in action at
Lyons to fill in the last space in the dossier compiled by Celtic on
their Cup-winners' Cup opponents, but insists that today's game is far
more important in the current situation.
''Everything in Europe is a bonus for us as we are in the middle of a
rebuilding programme, and we know that St Germain have to be favourites
after their record in appearing in three successive European
semi-finals, UEFA, Cup-winners' Cup, and Champions' Cup.''
Rangers manager Walter Smith is particularly anxious not to
over-stretch McCoist too quickly. ''I don't want a repetition of what
happened before when he was injured again because he pushed himself too
soon.''
Oleg Salenko has a hamstring injury suffered in training, and is out
of the squad for Firhill, but will be available for Italy. Smith would
like to think his men will give the same commitment and energy to
beating Thistle as they have in overcoming, in successive matches, three
of their strongest challengers in the championship race -- Celtic,
Motherwell, and Aberdeen.
Hibs, whose only depressing show this term was at Stark's Park where
they lost 3-0 to Raith Rovers, will wait for a check on striker Keith
Wright, who has a back injury, before their team for Parkhead is
settled, while Partick Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod adds Stephen
Docherty and Stuart Aitken to the squad and will ask the team to compete
seriously with the league champions and see where that takes them.
And with Hearts' manager Jim Jefferies last night completing a hectic
piece of business with MacLeod which saw agreement with Partick Thistle
to take striker Rod McDonald to Tynecastle in exchange for Scott Leitch
and Colin Miller, there could be a couple of new faces on view
Both clubs were hoping the deal could be completed to allow the
players to turn out for their new clubs today, but the agreement could
hit a stumbling block if the players feel the move is not right for
them.
If Jefferies is successful, it could mean that the team to face Raith
Rovers will look a bit different, but at least we can be sure that John
Robertson and Alan Lawrence will be involved somewhere up front.
Aberdeen are confident that they can repeat their Coca Cola Cup win at
Motherwell while Falkirk and Kilmarnock could fight out a memorable
contest at Brockville.

JAZZ
TROMBONIST George Masso and tenor saxophonist Harry Allen will kick
off the winter programme for Glasgow's Jazz Co-Op at the Moir Theatre on
Friday and the choice of these two American musicians underlines the
high standards the group are setting for themselves.
During the past two decades, Masso has established himself as one of
the major jazz voices on his horn although for around a quarter of a
century he buried himself in various New England teaching jobs before
eventually returning to the jazz scene only at the constant urgings of
cornettist Bobby Hackett.
That was in l973 and within months Masso was playing with the Benny
Goodman Sextet and keeping remarkably good company on live dates and in
the recording studios.
He remembers now: ''Bobby was always at me to come out and start
scuffling with the rest of the musicians. He knew that my family was
grown, and he knew that I was tempted by the thought of playing full
time again.
''I had had a spell with Jimmy Dorsey just after the war and the taste
was still there. So, after listening to him for quite some time, I took
the plunge and went to New York and, luckily things happened for me
there . . .''
Things didn't just happen, of course, Masso's immense talents made
things happen. After a year or more with Goodman, the trombonist joined
the World's Greatest Jazz Band of Yank Lawson and Bob Haggart, one of a
roster of illustrious trombone talents which graced that group during
the years of its existence. It was on one of that band's British tours
that I first became aware of Masso.
On that occasion he was partnered by a stalwart of the New York
studios, Sonny Russo, in a trombone team which did not lose much in
comparison with those pairings which had preceded them -- Lou McGarity
and Cutty Cutshall; McGarity and Carl Fontana; Vic Dickenson and Eddie
Hubble to name some.
It was a career move Masso savoured. For here he was stepping into the
shoes of McGarity, the man who had inspired him to take up trombone in
the first place.
Masso remembers to this day the effect McGarity's playing had on him.
He will tell you: ''I heard this Goodman track on the radio. It was a
song called Yours and Lou had an eight-bar solo, just eight bars, but
that was enough for me. I was hooked from that moment on and Lou has
remained my main influence.''
You can hear that influence in his playing. As for his partner,
tenorist Harry Allen, he is another musician who keeps the best of
company ever since being adopted, in a musical sense, by the late, great
drummer Oliver Jackson who took him under his wing in New York.
Recently he combined with pianist Keith Ingham on two sumptuous CDs
devoted to the music of Billy Strayhorn and the last time I saw him in
New York earlier this year he was in a group led by the legendary
pianist Joe Bushkin, who enthused over the young man's work.
The duo look sure to provide a memorable evening and we can all be
assured that good songs will abound. These men know their way around the
Great American Song Book, their records tell you that.

SCOTLAND'S Julie Forbes, the holder, shot a two-over-par opening round
of 75 yesterday in the #60,000 Nestle French Open at St Endreol.
She was six strokes adrift of Sweden's Lotta Sorenstam, who leads by
one stroke from England's Alison Nicholas and Joanne Morley, who share
second place with France's Marie-Laure de Lorenzi.
Lindsey Irvine was the best of the Scots after a round of 72. Leading
first-round scores (British and Irish unless stated, * denotes amateur):
70 -- C Sorenstam (Sweden).
71 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France), A Nicholas, J Morley.
Scottish scores: 72 -- L Irvine. 73 -- G Stewart. 75 -- J Forbes. 76
-- K Marshall. 77 -- P Wright. 80 -- T Craik.
* FORMER US amateur champion Billy Mayfair recovered from an early
bogey to take a two-stroke lead after his third round at the Las Vegas
Invitational in Nevada yesterday.
Mayfair, playing at Las Vegas Country Club, one of three courses used
in the five-round event, gathered six birdies for a five-under-par 67.
He posted a 17-under total of 198 with two rounds to play, while
fellow Americans Tom Byrum (67), John Cook (69), Mark O'Meara (66), and
Brad Bryant (67) were tied for second on 15-under 200 with nearly half
the field back in the clubhouse. Leading early scores (USA unless
stated):
198 -- B Mayfair 66, 65, 67. 200 -- T Byrum 66, 67, 67; J Cook 67, 64,
69; M O'Meara 67, 67, 66; B Bryant 65, 68, 67. 201 -- P Azinger 67, 67,
67.
* CRAIG Everett, of Caldwell, cruised to an emphatic win yesterday in
the Mount Ellen Assistants' Championship with a 16-under par total of
188 for his three rounds.
A final round 64 left him six shots clear of the rest of the field,
despite the fact that he carded his first bogey of the tournament at the
twelfth.
Meanwhile, further down the prize list, the battle was on to secure
victory in the order of merit. Early calculations suggest that Euan
McIntosh will finish the season top for yet another year, despite what
could have been a costly bogey at the last.
The Braid Hills assistant looks as if he has stolen the show from John
Wither, of Paisley, whose share of twenty-fourth place does not look
like netting him sufficient points to stay on top. However, the pair
will have to wait until later today to hear from the PGA who officially
heads the tables. Scores:
188 -- C Everett (Caldwell) 61, 63, 64. 194 -- J Greaves (Glasgow) 62,
66, 66; C Orr (Gleddoch) 64, 66, 64. 195 -- S Rosie (Glenbervie) 64, 67,
64; S Henderson (Kings Links) 67, 67, 61. 196 -- C Fergusson (Royal
Troon) 65, 68, 63; E McIntosh (Braid Hills) 63, 66, 67. 198 -- M Hastie
(Turnberry Hotel) 65, 65, 68. 199 -- D Fleming (Turnberry Hotel) 62, 67,
70.
* BETSY King and Pat Bradley both shot two-under-par rounds of 70 for
two-round aggregates of 138 yesterday to share the lead in the World
Championship of Women's Golf with Laura Davis (71) at Cheju Island,
South Korea.
* SCOTLAND'S Raymond Russell is in joint second place at the halfway
stage of the UAP Grand Finale tournament at Quinta do Peru, near Lisbon,
Portugal.
He shot a six-under-par 66 in yesterday's second round to be one
stroke behind leader Ricky Willison, who broke the course record with a
64. Leading aggregates (English unless stated):
137 -- R Willison 73, 64.
138 -- F Valera (Spain) 71, 67; R Russell (Scotland) 72, 66; J Rask
(Sweden) 70, 68.
139 -- A Sandywell 70, 69; S Little 68, 71; E Bolognesi (Italy) 69,
70; T Planchin (France) 71, 68; F Larsson (Sweden) 71, 68.
140 -- R Edwards 71, 69; P Sjoland (Sweden) 68, 72; S Hurley 71, 69; N
Vanhootegem (Belgium) 71, 69; M Persson (Sweden) 70, 70.
* JOSE Maria Olazabal, who withdrew from the European Ryder Cup team
last month with an aggravated foot injury, will compete in the $1m
Challenge next month, tournament organisers said in Johannesburg
yesterday.

FIRM ground at Kelso has reduced today's feature race, the #5000
Greenmantle Ale Anthony Marshall Trophy Handicap Chase, to a
matchbetween two Borders-trained runners, Kilcolgan and Side of Hill.
Nine were declared, including What Fettle, who has won over an
extended three miles on this track four times, but the recent rain has
not made sufficient impact to satisfy all the trainers.
Side of Hill, trained at Hawick by Bruce Mactaggart, won the Famous
Grouse Handicap Chase in the last 50 yards at the last meeting, but his
slight advantage in the weights may not be enough to beat Dawn
Goodfellow's Kilcolgan. In a novices' chase at Kelso in the spring, with
a terrific finishing burst he went past five horses on the run-in.
The Potterton Myson Handicap Hurdle, confined to mares, has also been
hit by withdrawals with only four lining up to share the prize money of
#3000.

WILD PLACES
ON MY left the steep heather slopes had begun to gather the darkness
of early evening into their recesses. A buzzard glided across to one of
the pines on the first covex ridge of the brae, bird and tree
silhouetted on the grey sky. Something a little paler moved out from
behind the lanky junipers and defined itself as a pair of young stags,
mouthing tussocks of grass along a burnside. At my feet the Feshie
flowed in spate. It was going to be a long, wet summer.
The glen here is a mile wide and half of that is taken up with the
interweaving channels of the river itself and its tributaries from the
west. The water curves and rolls over a plain of stones, interwoven with
grass and blue violets on its higher, drier levels, where the
river-rounded boulders wear a dark patina of lichen and pockets of
sediment form tiny seedbeds.
All around the water was whispering as it worked on its old business
of moving ground, creating and destroying, undermining pine roots and
feeding the roots of the violets.
For the whole glen was the creation of water, not in its present
varied and rapid abundance but in another form: ice. It was a young
landscape I was standing among, just ten thousand years since the
glaciers had scraped out the valleys, deepening and emphasising the
preglacial topography. At one stage in the process of the ice-sheet
melting, a glacier had felt its way through the weaknesses of Glenfeshie
to grind down to the greater Spey glacier. Since then, the metled water
had circled season by season and tinkered at the edges of the glacier's
creation. A landrover track was not even an obstacle to that.
A third stag was moving down the line of the deer fence fifty yards
away. He paused at the corner to sniff me out, then skidded down the
bank and splashed across the river, hardly wet to his knees. On the far
side at the foot of the sharp ridge was a broad alluvial meadow between
the Feshie and a side valley and it was covered with grazing deer. Big
herds are common in Glenfeshie and they seem almost tame in the summer.
Behind the deer were a few odd black dots on the grass, visible
through binoculars only. Occasionally one would rush at another and then
a glimpse of white revealed them as blackcock, jousting and displaying
in a lek. Silent miniatures behind a herd of model deer, the tumultuous
bubbling and puffing which accompanies these displays could only be
imagined.
As the stag reached the big herd, something spurred their wildness and
they began to walk, run, and then canter out of the meadow and ripple
across a far branch of the Feshie to the opposite side of the glen. When
I searched again for the blackcock the green was unbroken, like the near
and distant rushing of the water in the still air.
This was what wilderness looked and sounded like in Scotland. I was
alone, relaxed and paying attention, looking and learning. Access to an
evening like this was the purpose of the ownership of wild land.
Where was the wilderness now? It weas the bearded man beside me who
answered, from the rocky heights of the California mountains: ''Most of
the world will always be wild, the sky is -- so is the sea and the . . .
kingdom of crystals beneath the mass surface of the ground . . .''
The wilderness was the water. It was not what I could see but what I
could hear which eroded, there in Glen Feshie, the more superficial
definitions of wilderness and exposed a bedrock of granite meaning. The
point about wilderness is that it is not for our use at all. As John
Muir put it: ''The world, we are told, was made especially for man -- a
presumption not supported by all the facts.'' Wilderness is not for
anything but itself.

EMERGENCY payouts of more than #35m will begin to be paid next week to
farmers in north-east Scotland who suffered from the September
rainstorms, writes ROY GREGOR.
Following his second visit to the ravaged harvest fields yesterday,
Scottish Agriculture Minister Lord Lindsay announced #31m of arable area
payments to over 2800 farmers in the region on October 16 -- two months
ahead of schedule -- and increased payments of beef special premium,
worth #4m -- one month earlier than it is due.
Lord Lindsay said: ''This is a positive and practical response to help
north-east farmers facing cash flow problems after last months floods.
''It is realistic, it is of genuine value to north-east farmers, it is
affordable to taxpayers and it will be delivered quickly.''
Scottish NFU president John Ross said: ''I thank the Minister for his
positive response to the problems being experienced by farmers in the
north-east. It takes years for a farmer to recover from an event like
this and severely diminished cash flow is a major difficulty. We hope
the banks will help with rescheduling finance where appropriate.
''I am pleased that the Minister will be considering help for those
who face significant costs to repair structural damage. Meanwhile we
will continue to press for help from the European Union.''
It is estimated that almost 90% of arable claims will be met by next
week, the earliest possible date permitted under EC regulations.
Lord Lindsay said that beef special premiums are to be increased to
75% (#64.36). But Scottish NFU livestock convenor George Lyon said:
''The increase is welcome but it is disappointing that the Scottish
Office is unable to pay an advance of 80% which will be paid to
producers elsewhere in the UK.''

THE strength in depth of this year's Classic generation is
demonstrated by their dominance of today's Dubai ChampionStakes. Of the
older horses, only Environment Friend and Germany have been sent to take
them on and neither looks up to this.
Bahri is my idea of the winner. Placed in both the English and Irish
2000 Guineas and a winner of two Group 1 races at Ascot, John Dunlop's
star has shown himself to be one of the best milers for years. Since May
he has been beaten only by veteran champions Sayyedaati and Halling,
staying on well over 10 furlongs on the latter occasion.
Further success is on the cards, as principal rivals Tamure and
Spectrum are both likely to be tapped for speed.
Dunlop also has an excellent chance of taking the Cesarewitch with
Salaman. This son of Arc winner Saumarez has been brought on patiently
over the summer and still looks well handicapped despite having won four
of his five last races. He has a touch of class that should see him home
ahead of Saleel, the obvious danger, whose stamina may be exposed.
Old Red is well fancied and ran with promise on his reappearance last
month, but the form has not worked out well.
Oatis Regret should outclass his opposition in Kempton's Charisma Gold
Cup.
A promising novice last season, he was full of running when tripping
up at the last behind Brownhall here on Boxing Day. He closed out his
season with wins at Market Rasen and Sandown, where he looked
particularly smart, and he is taken to have made the necessary progress
to score here.
Atours could not quite cut it at the highest level last season, but
his first three efforts were faultless and he can make a winning
reappearance against lesser opposition in the Captain Quist Hurdle.
Best bet on the Kelso card may be Vain Prince in the Scottish Racing
Club Hurdle. He looked in good heart when firmly outpointing Persuasive
at Perth last month and had too much speed for probable favourite Sharp
Sensation when they met on the Flat in July.

north's leading Flat jockey was being filmed by the visitors from the
Far East in preparation for his visit to their country in December.
He is the only British representative in a special four-race

Darley, who will be joined on the foreign team by Mick Kinane, Thierry
Jarnet, Mike Smith and Pat Day, are rumoured to be earning #6000 a ride.

<TEXT>
STEVE Tew is among the first of a new breed of rugby man. In the
professional game, the key players will not be found only out on the
park. Just as Newcastle-Gosforth millionaire Sir John Hall was saying
last week, the teams which will succeed in the professional era are
those where the boardroom can match the prowess of the dressing room and
where doing the business means more than just putting together a string
of winning performances on the pitch.
The 37-year-old Tew has just been appointed full-time chief executive
of the Canterbury provincial side in New Zealand. Canterbury have
reacted to the new professionalism by overhauling their backroom
structure and are one of only three or four NZ provincial unions to have
appointed a board of directors where rugby expertise is generously laced
with input from management graduates and top-notch administrators.
This week, he has been in Scotland on a fact-finding mission at the
Scottish Sports Council, Rangers FC, and the Scottish Rugby Union. He
is, too, visiting Arsenal plus the Toronto Bluejays and New York Giants
baseball outfits.
''I want to look at their merchandising and marketing operations. This
has to be the way forward for rugby union.''
Canterbury, which will have a full-time staff of around 10
individuals, currently has an annual turnover of around #1m but, says
Tew, the financial spin-off is probably worth about #6m to traders and
commercial concerns.
Tew, a sports management graduate, will join Canterbury from his
position as general manager of the Hilary Commission, the New Zealand
equivalent of the Sports Council which is named after the conqueror of
Everest.
He will take over the reins just as the game in New Zealand begins to
benefit from its share of the #370m broadcasting deal negotiated with
News Corporation by the New Zealand, Australian and South African
unions.
''In addition to our regular provincial rugby, we will be one of the
geographical bases for the new International Provincial Championship
which is part of the Murdoch backed set-up. There will be five teams
from New Zealand, four from South Africa, and three from Australia.
''The five teams from New Zealand will be made up of the country's top
125 players regardless of their residential status. For instance, if
Auckland have the four best locks in New Zealand on their books, then
two of them will play for another side.''
Like many in New Zealand, Tew admires the concept in theory, but
expresses qualified concern about the reality of competition with
artificially created teams.
''It makes sense to have your best players involved but people in New
Zealand are not entirely convinced that artificially created teams will
play with the same passion and so on as established combinations. You
certainly want your best players exposed to a high-intensity competition
like this but, to be honest, it's a marketing exercise whereby many of
the sides will not have competed together before.
''The team based around the Canterbury provincial side will probably
be called the Canterbury Chargers, or something like that. Under the
terms of the new set-up, basically what has happened is that the
country's top 125 players are contracted to the NZ RFU and they are
handing them back to the provinces at no cost.''
New Zealand were at the head of the queue when the game lurched
initially and then rushed towards its new professional status.
Player-power, backed by an accommodating Union, meant that those in New
Zealand who favoured a professional game found themselves pushing
against an open door.
Tew says: ''Generally, the New Zealand public are in favour of the new
professionalism. What you have to remember is that we had a lot of
competition out there. There was the World Rugby Corporation thing. Then
we have rugby league across the ditch in Australia and nearer to home we
have the Auckland Warriors league side who have done well and have,
maybe, four players in their ranks who could have been an All Black
fullback.
''That's the kind of competition we're talking about. Add the number
of good players who go to Japan with the promise of 'jobs' and playing
for the company team and it became clear that something had to be done.
''In New Zealand we've been concerned for some time that for the game
to prosper we had to keep the best players within rugby union. Clearly,
the Rupert Murdoch thing and the new IPC has been a response to the
numerous threats that the game in New Zealand found itself under.''
And the new professional player will have his counterpart on the
sidelines as well. ''There is now a growing realisation in New Zealand
that, certainly from Provincial level upwards, the game is going to have
to be run on a professional basis and that does not mean just the
players.
''Three or four of the provincial unions are appointing full-time
chief executives, but what you have to remember is that rugby is the
national game and many of the provincial unions are actually bigger than
many national organisations from other walks of life in New Zealand.
''The challenge that faces us, though, is to ensure that the army of
unpaid volunteers who make the game work, week in and week out, do not
walk away. The game is still based on a very strong amateur ethic and
the challenge that we face in this quarter is a very strong one.''
And that is a challenge which the worldwide game has to face and to
which, at the moment, there does not seem to be a ready-made answer.

Farmers from abroad are astonished by the hardiness of Luing cattle,
which overwinter in the bitterest weather that Scotland's West Coast can
throw at them. Willy Newlands made them so tough
YOU can almost shout across from North Cuan, on Seil, to South Cuan,
on Luing. But they are separated by a swirling, dangerous strip of water
called Cuan Sound, which makes Luing very much an island. ''Two hundred
yards,'' said the boatman. ''But it might as well be 200 miles on a
stormy morning.''
At flood tide he is often amused by the sight of yachts under full
sail progressing swiftly backwards down the channel, and even on calm
days the modern, council-owned car ferry has to take a wide sweep to
beat the rushing water and claw her way into the side of the island
pier.
The starting point of the journey, on Seil, is not quite an island.
Like Skye, you can drive there. It is linked to the Argyll mainland by
the famous Bridge Over The Atlantic, a steep little humpback built two
centuries before the Skye bridge, in 1791. This semi-island's hamlets
are active with B&amp;B and self-catering cottages -- what the guidebook
describes as ''a little gentle tourism''.
Luing is sterner stuff. It is known for its Iron Age forts, thick
slates, and hardy cattle. In fact the cattle are more than just
well-known, they are world-famous.
The shaggy red cows have been developed over the past 50 years into a
distinctive Luing breed -- legalised by an Act of Parliament in 1965 --
which combines the all-weather ruggedness of the Highland cow with the
beefiness of the shorthorn bull. From their beautiful island in the
Lordship of Lorn, breeding Luings have been exported to Canada, New
Zealand, Australia, the United States, Uruguay, Austria, Germany . . .
almost every country that needs tough cattle to produce tender beef.
On a showery day in late summer, the breeding cows have been brought
together in small herds for us to ponder over their good points. A
couple of hundred knowledgeable guests lean on their long crooks and
discuss the things that West Highland stockmen do on these occasions,
ranging from helicopter spraying to the breeding success of the
corncrake.
All agree the cows and their February calves are looking very well.
The fitful sun shines on fox-red skins and the placid beasts return our
gaze calmly. And they are remarkably docile, considering the Wild
Western style of their upbringing.
Bruce Young, a partner in the family enterprise which has created the
Luing breed, explains: ''We own the island of Luing, which is 3500
acres, about five miles long by a mile wide, and also 1000 acres at
Clachan, on the mainland. We are the tenants of the island of Scarba,
which is about 3000 acres, and Torsa, 300 acres -- and we winter our
stock heifers out on those islands.''
Scarba is not a hospitable place and even on a summer's day its 1500ft
peak is a forbidding sight on the western horizon. At one time it had 14
families, but the last permanent inhabitants, a shepherd with his wife
and children, left for the less isolated island of Kerrera in the 1950s.
Today Scarba is uninhabited, although the owner opens up Kilmory Lodge
for a few weeks of stalking in the autumn.
The Luing heifers are taken out to the island by barge at the start of
the winter -- ''getting them on board can be a bit of a rodeo at times''
-- and left to their own devices. About three times a month, a boatload
of concentrated feed nuts is ferried across and put into automatic
feeders. These are adaptations of the pheasant feeder used by
gamekeepers, strengthened for their heavy-duty job and powered by
12-volt batteries. Keeping the batteries charged was a major problem
until windmill-powered chargers were fitted and the system now works
without a hitch all winter.
Bruce Young said that occasionally a beast is lost over a cliff, but
not often. Rustlers might be a problem -- and sheep wintering in small
flocks of 20-30 on various skerries and islets do sometimes disappear --
but Scarba is protected on its southern side, near Jura, by the
terrifying Corrievreckan Whirlpool and not many cattle thieves would be
willing to face what the sailing manuals describe as ''a whirling white
maelstrom of merciless ferocity'' with 20ft waterspouts and a roar which
can be heard 20 miles away.
Other stock heifers are swum across the narrow channel to the calmer
island of Torsa in the autumn. They are fed more regularly by hand and a
cowhand rows across every day from Luing. Again they get pelleted feed,
without hay or silage, scattered on tide-washed shelves, so that all the
muck is cleaned away by the waves and the cattle pick up their feed from
a clean surface every day.
There is little frost or snow on the islands of Lorn, but the winter
rain can be unremitting. In recent years it has been so bad that about
120 in-calf cows are now taken away to winter on family farms on the
east coast of Scotland. Like deer, they can withstand any amount of
cold, but weeks on end of soaking and chill winds can weaken them by
calving time.
The island of Luing holds 700 pedigree cows and 25 bulls together with
1850 blackface ewes. The ewes achieve a lambing success of 1.2 lambs per
ewe without any feeding and are ''left to their own devices'', which
seemed to interest many of the visitors much more than the figures about
the cattle. The young hoggs are put out on to islets in autumn and
nobody sets eyes on them again until May, when they are rounded up,
loaded into small boats and brought back to Luing.
The farming company now employs eight full-time staff for these varied
duties with boats and beasts, plus part-timers for busy summer periods
and also for the oyster-farming enterprise.
The neat little rows of white houses at Cullipool and Toberonochy were
once inhabited by slate-quarry workers, but the trade declined, the
island's main pier at Black Mill Bay burned down, and the tiny offshore
islet of Belnahua, which produced the best slates, was overwhelmed by a
storm which flooded the quarries. Slate has not been worked on Luing
since 1975.
The cottages are now visibly divided into those with washing lines and
children's toys, and those with trimmed fuchsias and closed shutters.
Goldfinches dance among the thistles and hares lollop in the fields --
although there isn't a rabbit anywhere. Offshore lie hugely expensive
sail cruisers.
The lords of the island are the cattle. To the untutored eye, they
seem rather variable to be a pure breed, with white patches appearing
here and there, the coat ranging from tight and shiny to long and curly,
the faces long or short. However, the experts see them as figures on
graphs, where the low-cost, outwintered, frugal beast triumphs in the
end over the fast-growing heavyweight needing more care, feed, and
investment. Statistics about easy calving and stocking rates count for
more than any beauty contest.
The Luing was created in the late 1940s by three farming brothers,
Shane, Dennis, and Ralph Cadzow, who were in the habit of buying
cross-Highland stirks in Oban each autumn to fatten on their farms in
the Lothians. They decided they could improve on the stock, bought the
island and, triumphing over obstructive red tape, created their own
breed.
Today the founders have retired, as honorary presidents of the breed
society, and the island enterprise is run by a son, Shane Cadzow, who
lives in Ardlarach, on Luing, and a son-in-law, Bruce Young, who also
farms at Kirkgunzeon, Dumfriesshire.
What makes the Luing story possible, according to Bruce Young, is a
small green patch on the island map, described as The Meadows. This
acreage of good land produces 2500 tons of silage in two cuts, carrying
the main herd through the winter. About 100 tons of hay is brought in,
with concentrates for the out-island heifers, but the silage is the
mainstay of the operation.
The value of these few acres of good grass has been recognised for
centuries and they helped Luing to support more than 600 crofting
families at one time. In the middle of the last century, Lord
Breadalbane experimented with a dairy herd on the island, building
slate-lined slurry pits and using a steam engine and pump to spread the
liquid manure over the meadows from fixed cast-iron pipes.
However, the experiment was rather ahead of its time and the project
collapsed. ''The pipes still turn up when we're ploughing,'' said Young.
''They prove that many of our new ideas are not all that new . . . ''
The memories of the crofter and quarrying families come alive most
vividly in the old churchyard of Kilchatton, the roofless kirk under its
sycamore trees abandoned since 1735, the slate headstones strongly
carved with the family histories of MacLachlans and MacDermids,
MacDougalls and MacDonalds. However, there is a new kirk on the island
and a primary school too, so the cattle and sheep, lobsters, and
tourists are keeping Luing alive in an era when many islands are still
being abandoned.
As we bumped along in a bale-lined trailer behind a tractor, I spoke
to one agricultural bureaucrat about the silage fields and their
influence on the history of the place. ''Yes, there's some truth in
that,'' he said. ''But subsidies are even more important than silage --
I wouldn't be surprised if something between #150,000 and #200,000 came
on to this little island in the form of subsidies of one kind or
another.''
He added: ''It's a social investment, if you like -- but even that
couldn't save Scarba.''
We were driving down Glen Dubh Lettir at the time, which can be
translated as Dark-side Valley, and is said to be the home of the
Ghlaisrig, an enormous demon who crept up on travellers under the cover
of darkness. There is a waterfall halfway down the glen where everyone
used to leave a thread of clothing, or even a hair, as a placatory gift.
''They should be leaving a little something for the Commissioners in
Brussels,'' said my travelling companion. ''The real fear here now is
that the subsidies will stop coming.''
As far as the future of the Luing breed is concerned, Young said:
''Some people would say there is a shortage of genetic material within
the breed, but I think if necessary we might need to go out to bring a
cross in. It has been done in the Shorthorn and Angus breeds, for
example, so there is no reason why it can't be done with the Luing. I'm
not saying it will be done, but it might be done in 10 or 15 years'
time.
''The breed is fulfilling the job for which it was designed, but we
are not complacent and we are always looking at new ideas and new
things.
''The Luing, Galloway and Highland breeds are popular in Germany and
Austria because they can be outwintered and they don't need to build
expensive sheds for them. I have a good friend in Austria who has a lot
of Luings and when he first took them there and outwintered them, the
general public thought he was off his head. It had never been heard of.
''Austrian television and press came to see him because they were
absolutely amazed at this. Now that they've got a taste of these cattle
that can survive outside -- down to 20 degrees below at times -- they've
got a good future on the Continent. But we've got to be looking for
something new.
''The average prices are going up at our annual sales of breeding
stock -- which moved to Castle Douglas from Oban in recent years but are
coming back to Oban this winter. I don't think there is any doubt that
we fit in with the way people would like agriculture to be moving in the
Highlands and Uplands. There is a strong feeling that the Government
will stop the subsidies for cattle and sheep up the west coast and I can
tell you that if that happens, the west coast will empty. It is a social
problem -- both the Government and the Department of Agriculture are
well aware of the situation and I know they will fight hammer-and-tongs
for us.''

TIGHT LINES
WHEN I was a youngster, my father, John, was a great one for the new
technology. In fact he was a bit of a techno-addict, at least when it
came to cameras. It started with stills but when the possibility of
making your own movies came along, he was off and turning over.
First there was eight millimetre, the spools for which, I seem to
remember, had to be turned round halfway through, then came Super-Eight
and eventually something superior which came in a sort of cassette and
made life a lot simpler. And of course, if you had a film, you needed a
projector to show it, so a mighty Eumig found its way into the house and
if you had a projector, well, it looked better with the big reels than
with the tiny ones the films came back from Kodak on, so enter the
editing machine. Five or six quick snicks, a few lengths of splicing
tape and you had a full-length movie. And with a full-length movie, you
couldn't possibly have those sacred frames being shown on the sitting
room wall, you needed a proper screen with the little glisteny bits on
it that made the picture stand out better.
And although he spent hours editing our holidays and day trips, not
much thanks did he ever receive for all his hard work. Well, I've
recently had all the home movies transferred to video, and I want to
publicly make him aware of my grateful thanks. Not only were there
delights in there that one had long since forgotten about, like the
shots of the Forth Road Bridge being built or me and the Beatles in the
Scottish Television studios back in the sixties and the first hours of
life of both my daughters, but there is a chronological record of my
fishing years!
And of course it is the things you had forgotten that fascinate. I
didn't remember that the day I caught my 4lb 10oz trout from the Yair
water on Tweed, I had earlier fallen in, but the pictorial evidence is
there for all to see. The emptying of the waders, the screwing up of the
face, the wringing out of the socks and then the different clothes and a
beaming face with the big fish.
There's the trip to Ireland where, somewhere in the south we stopped
to pat the donkeys and gave a couple of lads a banana each which they
proceeded to munch their way through -- unpeeled. There are some lovely
leafy shots of me up to the knees in the water fishing a dry fly and
catching a couple of finnock. The fact that I was wearing a
magnificently unfetching bright blue anorak with badges all over it,
drew squalls of laughter from my wife and aforementioned daughters. But
that's the small price you pay when you resurrect the past.
Some of my earliest fishing was done on the promenade at Joppa, the
slightly more cultured end of Portobello. There are memory-jerking shots
of all the pals of the time with a few mackerel and an odd flounder. It
is heady stuff and interesting to see how not only my tackle got more
and more like the real thing, but the hideous anorak disappeared in
favour of more muted colours.
There are the early days on Tay and Tweed, usually with not many fish,
and the funny shots of me trying to eat a Kit-Kat with my furry brown
balaclava on back to front. How I chortled, but was alone in my mirth.
The rest thought it unfunny in the extreme and the whole thing about
home movies came back to me. You really have to have been there. Looking
at a silent, flickering picture of someone else's life isn't the same.
You weren't there. You don't know the people or the places.
But for those that were, like me, it is fascinating. I still go to
some of the places but the fishing huts are bigger and smarter and it is
odd to see shots of the Sluices end of Loch Leven and all those boats
with no outboards.
Nowadays of course, it is the video camera that rules and I hope my
lot will look back on the videos that I've taken with as much pleasure
as I did to our home movies. So John, let me quote another man who has
appeared in the movies, Bob Hope, and say ''Thanks for the Memories''.

THE Premiership reaches the half-way point today, which is as good a
time as any for taking stock. The verdict from the players I have spoken
to is that it has been a success, and I say that despite the fact that,
early on, things didn't go quite the way we had hoped at Stirling.
My own view is that the rugby this season has been no worse than under
the old championship set-up. The spectators, who are, lest we forget,
the paying customers seem more than happy with the rugby that they've
seen and from the players' vantage point there is no doubt that the
eight-team format means that every game has had a bite to it which
wasn't there under the old order.
When we played Melrose last Saturday there must have been a crowd of
around 2000. When you consider that the entire population of Melrose
isn't much more than that then that's a sure indication that people are
prepared to turn out -- and travel from Stirling, for instance -- when
there's something at stake.
If I have a concern at all, it is that for a lot of players the season
will be over too soon. The Premiership will be decided by the end of
November, at which point the top players will embark upon the district
championship.
Throughout December the senior clubs will contest the regional leagues
as the forerunner to the cup competition but with so many of the
better-known players on district duty I wonder if the crowds will turn
out.
And if spectator appeal is going to be a problem with the regional
leagues then that is nothing compared to the problems which the district
championship has experienced in recent years.
This year's championship is going to be one of the most important in
the history of the game. As things currently stand -- and unless some
clubs who think differently can work a change of mind at Murrayfield --
at stake will be a couple of places in Europe next season.
That is a huge incentive for the players who will take part in the
championship but will it be enough to entice the fans away from their
firesides on a cold and dreary Sunday afternoon? Some of the district
games that I played in last season attracted just a handful of
spectators. Often the committee men outnumbered the paying punters and
it would have been easier for the man on the public address system to
introduce the crowd to the players rather than the other way around.
There doesn't appear to be a commercial sponsor for the championship
this season, which means that the onus will fall upon the SRU to promote
the series. People have to be told that the games are on and they have
to be told that they will feature all of the country's top players.
For years we have been told that the Scottish game should be based
upon the the New Zealand model, where the provinces take precedence over
the clubs. As players we are told that there should be a season-long
progression from club rugby, to district rugby, and then to the Five
Nations' Championship, with the going getting tougher step by step.
From a players' point of view, part and parcel of that progression
isn't just what happens on the playing field. The atmosphere that is
generated by playing in front of big crowds is part of the learning
process as well and, in this regard, the district championship falls
well short of what is required.
I'm all in favour of the district championship, but I would be more in
favour still if something could be done to turn it into a prime
attraction which no rugby fan would want to miss. That's the challenge
for those with responsibility for marketing the game in Scotland.

Dunbar farmer gets #50,000 at Lanark sale.
SCOTLAND's hill farmers have been complaining recently about a lack of
profitability in their industry but there was little indication of that
yesterday in Lanark on the concluding day of the annual sale of
blackface rams.
Prices from the start reached new heights. A breed record of #50,000
was set early in the sale when Willie Dunlop, Elmscleugh, Dunbar, sold
his first lamb to a syndicate comprising the McGregor brothers and
cousins from Allanfauld, Kilsyth, Dyke, Milton of Campsie, and Burnhead,
as well as Neil McCall Smith, Connachan, Crieff.
Even before the ringside had time to pause for breath Elmscleugh did
it again selling at #42,000 to Malcolm Coubrough, Whelphill, Abington,
David Anderson, Sweetshawshead, Cumnockhead and Alex Kirkpatrick,
Kirkhope, Girvan. The Elmscleugh consignment grossed #160,000 breaking
all the previous records.
So furious was the trade that minutes later the brothers David and
Andrew Kay, Burncastle, Lauder sold their choice ram for #36,000 to
David Dixon, Kilbride, Dalmally, Ian McArthur, Arnicle, Campbeltown and
David Macleod, Glenboig, Fort William. Browncastle, enjoying their best
trade for years also went on to sell at Elmscleugh.
The Elmscleugh pen also had one sale at #17,000 to Sam and John
McClymont, Tinnis, Yarrow, Selkirk. Meanwhile, enjoying his best ever
two days at Lanark Malcolm Coubrough of Whelphill sold animals for
#10,000 to Tom Renwick and Sons, Blackhouse, Selkirk.
Another best price at Lanark came midway through the sale for Ian and
John Macpherson, Ballieamenoch, Dalmally when they sold at #14,000 to
Jim Blackwood, Nether Wellwood, Muirkirk.
However, as on the first day, Alan and John Wight from Midlock,
Abington, cracked the market with a stunning run of high prices. Their
best went for #38,000 in a joint deal to John Harkin, Ballymana,
Northern Ireland, Hugh Finlay, Blackcraig, Castle Douglas, and Andrew
Paton, Craig, Newton Stewart. And then again at #36,000 Midlock sold to
Elmscleugh and Ian Hunter, Dalchurhda, Crieff.
Five of the Midlock sheep went for more than #10,000 with another
going at #14,000 to James Duncan Millar, Remony and Alex Murray, Lurgan,
Crieff. Neil McCall Smith, Connachan, Crieff, also sold at the top of
the trade with their first making #19,000 to Holylee and Blackcraig.
They also sold animals at #22,000 to Faccombe Estates, Hadington and Jim
Jackson, Pole, Lochgoilhead, and Claddich Farms, Dalmally.
Angus Kennedy had the final five-figure price selling at #14,000 to
Hugh Blackwood, Auldhouseburn, Muirkirk, and James Sharp, Longcroft,
Lauder.
Averages: Burncastle (9) Top #36,000, Average #7400; Elmscleugh (10)
#50,000, #16,420; Midlock (11) #38,000, #12,141; Connachan (6) #22,000,
#8208; Mitchellhill (5) #14,000, #3070; Balliemeanoch (6) #14,000,
#3663; Sweetshawhead (5) #12,000, #3060.
Overall: 504 ram lambs averaged #1600.95 -- up #479.01. Auctioneers --
Lawrie &amp; Symington.

SCOTTISH MASTERS
Helen Smalies examines the life of a talented painter who struggled to
deal with the march of progress
NOW a forgotten celebrity, Kenneth MacLeay was once in demand as
Scotland's most talented miniature painter and the Raeburn of
watercolour portraiture. Born in Oban, MacLeay proudly claimed descent
from Robert the Bruce, the Jacobite Stewarts of Appin and ''the gallant
Keppoch'' of the Forty-five.
From Glasgow, where he made his debut as a miniature painter, MacLeay
migrated to Edinburgh as a student of the Trustees' Academy and in his
mid-twenties became a founding member of the Royal Scottish Academy.
During the 1830s he began to exploit the growing fashion for elaborately
finished watercolour and crayon portraiture. MacLeay's clientele
encompassed both the middle-class social and intellectual elite of
Edinburgh and the landed gentry of the West of Scotland where he
cultivated very profitably his public profile as an exiled Highlander.
To this day many of his watercolour cabinet portraits survive.
During the late 1850s MacLeay's prospects suffered a sudden decline
which coincided paradoxically with the peak of his achievement as an
artist. By this date there were at least 24 photographic studios
operating in Edinburgh alone. For a miniature painter such as MacLeay,
the competition was overwhelming.
Like many of his contemporaries MacLeay responded to this challenge by
taking up professional photography himself. His brief experiment proved
abortive. In 1859 MacLeay filed for bankruptcy.
The closing phase of MacLeay's career was dominated by a desperate
struggle to revive his reputation. First, he diversified into
large-scale landscape painting in oils in a style strongly recalling the
work of Horatio McCulloch. Then, in 1863, he received a royal commission
for a miniature of Prince Alfred, Queen Victoria's second son.
Two years later the Queen ordered a set of watercolour portraits of
her favourite retainers at her Highland retreat of Balmoral. Within
months this project has evolved into an ambitious pictorial survey of
the principal Highland clans.
Between 1865 and 1869 MacLeay travelled all over Scotland in quest of
his sitters. As stipulated by royal command, his watercolours were both
closely observed portraits of ''representative'' but specific
individuals and highly decorative costume studies which were and have
remained unequalled as a record of contemporary tartan.
Published in 1870 and illustrated with colour lithographs after
MacLeay's watercolours, The Highlanders of Scotland is a collector's
item. It is the artist's misfortune -- but one which he might well have
appreciated -- that he is now remembered only as the ''Highlander of The
Highlanders''.

KEVIN McKenzie will watch Stirling County from the sidelines at
Mansfield Park today as they seek revenge for that SRU Tennents
Premiership first-day defeat by Hawick and it is a prospect which he
considers to be horrific.
The County captain said yesterday: ''I'm not a good spectator. I set
myself very high standards and get very upset when I think that others
are not meeting those standards.
''I've tried to calm down my captaincy because I know that team-mates
are doing their best, but watching from the touchline is even worse. I
find it very, very difficult.''
McKenzie, who damaged the medial ligament in his right knee against
Melrose last weekend, has been undergoing daily physiotherapy at
Stirling Royal Infirmary but still expects to be out for three weeks.
He knows better than most that the Scotland game against Western Samoa
on November 18 is rushing over the horizon and that he will have
precious little time in which to stake his claim for the hooker's berth
made vacant by the retiral of Kenny Milne.
''All being well, I expect to be back in action in time for the
national squad session on November 5. I'm doing weights and the
treatment seems to be going okay but the last thing I want to do is to
rush it,'' said McKenzie.
Today, Stirling will also be without scrum half Kenny Harper, who has
been such an influential presence since his return from injury. The
teenager, Fraser Kennedy, who came into the side when Harper was injured
once again in the last minute of last weekend's stirring victory at the
Greenyards, retains his place in the absence of suspended Murray Fraser.
Gareth Flockhart (groin) and Gus Turner (ribs) are also absentees,
providing a headache for coach Brian Edwards at just the mid-way point
in the premiership when consolidation of the upturn in the champions'
fortunes was most required.
However, according to Hawick captain Brian Renwick, the Greens would
rather that County were at full strength. Maybe there's just a bit of
kiddology going on here but the Hawick back-row man said yesterday:
''There's no reason why we can't do the double over Stirling but the
last thing that we want is to beat them and then for them to say that
they were short of four regulars.
''When we beat them in the opening game of the season we didn't allow
Brian Ireland and co. to steal the amount of ball that they normally do.
We tied them in, got there in numbers, and denied Brian the vital
seconds that he needs to pirate loose ball. I'm not giving away any
secrets when I say that will be very much the intention again
tomorrow.''
Elsewhere in Premiership I, Edinburgh Accies will be out to repeat
their convincing day-one victory over Boroughmuir but this time on their
own patch.
Melrose, for whom foot fracture victim Craig Joiner now looks likely
to miss the Western Samoan Test, are going for the double over Heriot's
FP, and Watsonians seek to keep their premiership challenge on course
with a double win over Gala.

SCOTCHING THE MYTHS
Starving was big business for a superstar of self denial. JIM HEWITSON
records, hungrily, the antics of a man who laughed in the face of
anorexia
ATTEMPTS in 1706 to disrupt, or force the abandonment of, the last
session of the Scots Parliament meeting to consider Union with England,
by staging a national fast, surely go down in the list of Scotland's
great historical non-starters. Boy, how they could have done with a
showman like Scott the Faster, a superstar in the starving stakes, to
organise the event.
Last week we saw how the protest, which dissenters hoped would provide
an excuse for rioting, fizzled out when the ministers stuck to a totally
impartial line on the Union issue calling only for divine guidance for
the Estates and refusing on the appointed fast day to preach from the
pulpit against the proposals.
Two hundred years earlier John Scott, a Teviotdale man, caused a
sensation not just in Scotland but across the Continent with his ability
to abstain from food and drink for ridiculously long periods. This
strange talent was put to the test many times and Scott confounded all
the experts. If you've ever suddenly discovered an unexpected talent for
fitting gas pipes or whistling Romanian folk songs then you'll have an
idea how chuffed the Faster must have been.
It wouldn't have surprised me to learn that Scott, as a child, had
been a bit ''picky'' with his food, but unfortunately details of his
early life are non-existent and, it's reasonable to assume, fairly
unremarkable. However, he came into the public eye in a spectacular way
in 1531.
Taking refuge in the debtors' sanctuary in the Abbey of Holyrood after
an unsuccessful lawsuit he condemned the verdict against him and began a
fast which lasted 30 days, or 40 if you believe other sources.
News of this miracle reached James V who decided to test Scott's
unusual method of protest by locking him up in a room in Edinburgh
Castle and leaving him with only a small but regular supply of food and
water. For 32 days Scott went without any form of sustenance, his tray
of essentials left untouched. And he was set free. By this time it must
have been clear to Scott that he was on to a winner and he emerged from
the castle, half-naked and wild-eyed, to announce to the crowd that his
talent was all down to support from the Blessed Virgin and that if
necessary he could go without food for as long as he pleased.
In Edinburgh some thought him a wonder-worker but others who knew him
better believed he was either mad, or simply bad. So off to the
Continent went Scott where he staged a fast for the benefit of Pope
Clement VII and similarly impressed the citizens of Venice by starving
himself in public. Next stop was London where he was thrown into jail
for criticising Henry VIII. What was Scott's response? He went on his
most spectacular fast to date -- an incredible 50 days.
Finding his way back to Edinburgh, Scott set up his stall, or more
accurately, his altar, in a house in the city's western suburbs. He even
got his daughter kitted out as the Virgin Mary and for a while the more
gullible citizens swallowed it all. Ironically, after he was forced out
of business Scott, quite uncatchable in the fast lane, is said to have
eaten and drunk himself to death.
It's interesting to note that in the 1700s the phenomena of
vegetarians and fasters caused almost equal astonishment. In Clapham,
London, journals reported the amazing case of a man who hadn't touched
butchers' meat for 25 years and drank nothing but water. Changed days,
indeed.
Next week it's back to Edinburgh to see how that incident-packed final
session of the Scots Parliament is progressing.

'The long and the short of it is that the youngsters in life need role
models, and rugby has lost so many opportunities to promote them
actively.'
THREE things struck me the other day. Shade Munro told me that he took
a class of boys from a football school for rugby. These were young lads,
and one demanded to do an imitation of Gavin Hastings.
Shade let him, and the little bloke went through a magical pantomime
depicting big Gav dropping a high ball -- and he had it off to a tee,
the posture and the voice included.
The boy evidently finished off his routine by wiping his hair in
disgust and uttering: ''Oh, dash it . . . I appear to have dropped the
ball,'' in his finest Morningside accent. The class roared and, of
course, they all knew Gavin Hastings.
Next, I was at a general sports dinner at the rugby club in Linlithgow
with Jim Leishman, and there were some questions from the floor. The
first was a rugby one, and it read: ''Does the panel think that Kirsty
Young is good for Scottish rugby?'' It was great, and there were hearty
belly laughs, but everyone knows who the highly-talented Kirsty is, and
who our chap on this very page is.
Lastly, Jordanhill school celebrated its 75-year anniversary with a
game against the Glasgow Schools at Hughenden, and it was a fantastic
game in dreadful conditions, and I suddenly got to thinking that here
was a special group of talent that would be tempted into all sorts of
arenas. Is rugby laying in front of these lads the kind of people they
would like to imitate?
Look, the long and the short of it is that the youngsters in life need
role models, and rugby has lost so many opportunities in the past to
promote them actively. Gavin Hastings has just retired and, as Jim
Telfer said himself, Gavin, at or around the World Cup, was possibly the
best known Scottish sportsman.
All the little lads in Shade Munro's class knew Gavin Hastings.
Everybody at the dinner knew Kenny Logan, and every lad at Hughenden on
that wet Wednesday night was desperate to meet and know a superstar. A
current Scottish rugby player.
Crikey, I remember, as a young lad at University, following big Gordon
Brown around Glasgow city centre for 10 minutes, staying just 10 yards
behind him and trying to figure out how tall he was and what build he
was. I just wanted to measure up beside an internationalist.
It's laughable isn't it, but we all know deep inside us that we're all
like that aren't we? Inside every little boy, and some not so little
ones, there is a fan bursting to get out.
There are many in rugby who think that the publicity that some of the
players are getting now is bad news for them and bad news for the game
of rugby. I don't agree.
Why on earth rugby as a game over the years has not actively promoted
the likes of Gavin Hastings, Craig Chalmers, Kenny Logan, Kenny Milne
and the media friendly and likeable hordes before them, I don't know.
Why we have not ploughed direct resources into these people beats me.
I have to tell the SRU that there are many, even in their own
organisation, who will readily say that one thing that the union fails
to do is promote the game. It's a flaming easy allegation to make, I
know, and I don't for one minute agree with the allegation in total. But
I do agree with it in a large part.
The SRU will argue, I'm sure, that the most effective way to promote
the game is to put as many resources into the national team's
preparation so that it can win as many games as possible and therefore
attract as many players into the game as possible. And admirable money
is being ploughed into a new image and youth rugby.
But there's more to promoting a game than that. There are things
called PR and profile. The game can achieve a higher profile by using
the players it has by helping them financially to promote the game. The
place needs PR. Craig Chalmers was telling me that he was helping to
teach rugby to 24 primary schools in the Borders the other day. Never
knew about it.
There are many that will argue that stories about Kenny Logan and
Kirsty Young damage rugby. Others argue that Craig Chalmers writing a
column, which he does, damages rugby. Poppycock. It's tremendous for
rugby. It takes rugby from the genteel smoking rooms of the gentlemen's
clubs -- if ever it rested there -- to the people. It creates fame.
I just wish that instead of having to do an impersonation of Gavin
Hastings, the little lad in Shade Munro's class could have been taken
through his paces by Gavin Hastings -- and promised some back-up.
Fame is good for rugby. Come on SRU, promote the players, and by that
token promote the game.

HOME IS WHER THE ART IS
George Parsonage is a local hero who has saved countless souls from
the clutches of the Clyde. But less well known are his remarkable
sculptures, also culled from the murky waters. Ann Donald investigates
IF YOU should chance to peer over the garden hedge of the only house
in Glasgow Green, then your eyes may alight on a rusty but resplendent
peacock standing atop the garage roof with its plume of metallic
machinery ''feathers'' welded together in a show of arrogant glory. Like
the clutch of tall, spiky, and rather threatening balls of metal welded
to poles that lurk behind the garden's overgrown mass of plants, flower
tubs, hanging baskets and vines, the peacock is a rare public example of
the work of little-known junk sculptor George Parsonage. For unless you
caught an episode of the BBC sitcom Mac, happen to be an acquaintance of
the reticent sculptor himself, or attend the annual Macmillan Fund
exhibition for cancer research then it is unlikely you will have ever
seen the utterly imaginative and often humorous work that litters
Parsonage's small Miss Marple-like cottage which stands on the bank of
the Clyde.
Though a graduate from Glasgow School of Art back in 1967 and an art
teacher at Whitehall Secondary for 21 years, the 51-year-old sculptor
seems to have spurned the mores of the conventional art world,
preferring to work on his own terms. ''I don't want to get involved with
the rat race -- and that includes the established art world,'' he states
with a grin.
In fact Parsonage's art work is determined to a great extent by his
other full-time occupation as head of the Glasgow Humane Society. Having
inherited the job from his father two years ago, Parsonage became head
of the oldest life-saving society in the world. Dressed in blue boiler
suit and with the essential pager at the ready for any emergency, he
explains: ''It's the saving of people in danger of drowning, recovery of
persons who have drowned, and any other work to do with the stretch of
the river between Lanark and Erskine Bridge.''
Not only has the river furnished him with the actual materials for his
sculptures -- ''90% of the pieces I use have been retrieved from the
river'' -- but much of the subject matter as well. For example, down by
the boat station an enormous pelican sculpture has been hoisted on to a
winch post, where its reddish rusting wings float up and down in the
wind as if an animated character in a fairy tale. As well as being a
popular tourist attraction for those passers-by on the way to the
People's Palace, it serves as a nesting spot for a blackbird who settles
annually.
Elsewhere in the makeshift narrow gallery beside the boat house a
magnificent galleon ship rests on a plinth. ''This was my protest
against the dumping of supermarket trolleys in the river,'' explains the
white-haired sculptor as he points to the frame of the welded wonder.
''At Govan there are 500 of them, so at low-tide you can see them 20ft
deep.''
Like a guessing game, the sculpture yields a continual series of
revelations as the viewer realises that a motor-cycle mudguard forms the
semi-circled base, old etching plates the choppy waves, a coat hanger
the central mast, a padlock, machine cogs, saw blades have all been
rescued, reconstructed, and introduced as components of a fantastic,
very tactile sculpture.
Back in the cottage, where an organised mountain of magazines, videos,
tapes, ropes, and wellingtons takes precedence, is the piece that he
most values -- The Crazyfixion as it's been affectionately dubbed.
Viewed from the first-floor landing the narrow steel cross standing over
10ft high and 7ft wide indeed resembles Christ on the cross, with the
tiny wracked figure encompassed by a crown of thorns, literally made out
of nails. However, when you look around at the plethora of rowing
certificates, posters, photographs, and framed photocopies of newspaper
cuttings heralding the winners of rowing competitions, which testify to
Parsonage's passion for rowing, then The Crazyfixion takes on a new
dimension. ''It's like a conventional Christ on the Cross if you look at
it straight on,'' says George, ''but if you look flat down on it then
it's an oarsman. When you're doing a 2000m regatta and you've done 1800m
then your sweat band feels like a crown of thorns.''
As the man who still holds a place in the Guinness Book of Records for
rowing the length of Loch Ness in 2hrs 43mins in 1975, it is fair to
assume he knows what he's talking about here.
As a religious man himself -- ''you couldn't do this job and not
believe in something'' -- Parsonage confesses to being very happy with
the sculpture's present practical use in the community. ''It's a cult
piece that's done a tour of all the churches,'' he smiles. ''And it's
now part of an Easter dawn service held by the Ecumenicals on the Green
every year.''
This method of by-passing the critics and going direct to the public
with his art is clearly what pleases Parsonage. As we peek into the tiny
workshed cluttered with his ''junk'' and tools of the art trade, he
tries to explain why he has never felt the urge to exhibit. ''I don't
know if it's because I don't want to hear people being critical of my
work or not,'' he ponders. ''What I do is a very personal thing. At
least here on the Green it's ordinary folk who are giving you honest,
not supercilious, criticism. For example, I get the lads from the
shipyards commenting on how rotten my welding is or there's the guy that
keeps on telling me to paint my rusty work white,'' he laughs.
Mentioning the similarity between some of his own work and that of the
? man George Wylie, Parsonage gives a wry grin and only adds, ''Ah yes,
George learnt a lot from me.''
This stubborn independent streak regarding his art as well as the
nature of his 24-hour post as head of the Glasgow Humane Society means
that commissions and deadlines are out of the question. ''I will never
make a market for anyone. I can't submit something like that,'' he
shakes his head adamantly. ''If people see something and like it then
great, but I can't have someone tell me what to make.''
Ideas come, he explains, from spotting a piece of metal and suddenly
realising its potential to be transformed into a bird, or ship, or in
the case of BBC's Mac, a screaming man with telephone. Referring to the
small saw-blade bird that doubles as a letter rack and is now perched on
top of his TV, Parsonage elucidates on his working methods. ''I can
usually knock up an idea in two or three days,'' he says. ''Then it'll
take me a couple of years of placing it on the telly, looking at it,
thinking, looking, thinking before it's finally ready.'' After which it
will stand in the colourful front garden for all and sundry to enjoy the
metallic fairy tale of larger than life sculptures, before being sold
off in the annual Macmillan charity and the sculptor will start on
another collection.

BIRDWATCH
* AT this time of year, ducks look different. Drakes of most species
of dabbling duck take on the drap ''eclipse'' plumage once the breeding
cycle is over. A mallard loses his bottle-green head, white collar and
ducks-arse backside; indeed, compared with his winter finery, he is just
a ''Mallard Imaginaire'', as they used to call Bombay Duck. Some
birdwatchers become impossibly recondite about the subtleties of the
plumage changes of ducks during eclipse, but most of us simply stop
looking at them until we can recognise them again in October.
It was always a treat as a child to go ''down to the ducks'' and throw
them bread. Some of these looked like their wild relations but the
''Mire Duck'', ''Muir Duck'' and ''Moss Duck'' as the old Scots names
describe them will be up and away before you have got within a quarter
mile of them, especially if they are wild winter mallard from Iceland or
Russia. The species is widely dispersed as well as common in Scotland
and can adapt its feeding and behaviour to the proximity as well as the
paucity of man.
Since Chaucer's time, mallards (the word means simply male) have had a
reputation for sexual aggression. Sexual displays are often all-male
affairs, though intended for female observation. Behaviourists have
called the various displays ''shaking'', ''grunt whistling'',
''head-up-tail-upping'', ''mock preening'' and so on, all useful terms
for observers of raves. Females may incite one male while threatening
another.
Ah weel, there you are. Late in the season, unmated drakes may attack
females without bothering to go through the display rituals. Such
vigorous pursuit of a female by several males at once is probably a
reaction to overcrowding. A more plesant footnote about the relationship
between the sexes: it is the ducks which go ''quack'', the drakes having
a more high pitched, grating note; and when they fly as a pair, the
female usually takes the lead. Watch for yourself.

* THE Dead Sea lies between Israel and Jordan, 400 metres below sea
level, and is the lowest point on earth. Funny place for a health spa,
but never mind. The natural is never organised. And pilgrimages are
often made to the most unreasonable areas on the global map. Hundreds of
thousands of people visit the Sea for mineral therapy, or maybe it's
just to see if they can really float unaided.
Minerals can be absorbed through the skin via mud masks, salts or
baths, and are essential for the skin's suppleness. Sun, pollution and
stress deplete the body's natural resources, all of them probably,
leaving it dull. Minerals are a natural exfoliant, improve blood
circulation and act as a relaxant. (That'll explain all that floating.)
Dead Sea minerals also allegedly help psoriasis and eczema. Boots have
introduced a range of Dead Sea products including Relaxing Bath Salts,
#4.99 for 500g; Moisturising Mineral Bath, #4.99 for 300ml; and
Purifying Mud Mask for Body and Face, #4.99 for 200g, to save you a
plane flight.
* THE sea of course, is largely unexplored, but what is known is
mostly polluted and abused. Pity that. You shouldn't bite the hand that
feeds you. All living creatures rely on seaweed for survival; it is the
sole producer of 70% of the world's oxygen and nature never allows it to
deplete. Seaweed reproduces at a remarkable rate, with some species
growing almost 2ft a day.
Thankfully, it has its own self-filtering process, so it does not
absorb toxins. It is truly, a god-like autocratic.
As early as 60BC the Romans recognised its healing qualities. The
Japanese still eat around 50g of seaweed a day. Seaweed also has an
uncanny similarity in structure to human plasma. Holistic health
advocates the world over swear by the fantastic results of seaweed on
ageing skin.

HAIR
Straight hair is out, reports Anvar Khan from the tonsorial front, and
voluminous glamour is back. But for heaven's sake, remember the loo roll
IT'S just as well hair grows. This season layering is out and geometry
is in. There are no stages in fashion's career, style is a catalogue of
extremes. Flat hair has been demoted. Everything is big again, big hips,
big bust, big hair. Cartoon glamour is back, over-egged and
over-indulgent. Pure Hollywood.
The Taylor Ferguson hot-off-the-press pack delivered to the Beauty Box
surgery includes some styling tips straight out of Blue Peter. The
internationally recognised Scots hairdresser is admirably down-to-earth.
He too, has environmentally friendly recipes, which use up modern-day
detritus, only to make more useless, anti-utilitarian objects.
On how to create a voluminous shoal of shine, a la Hayworth or
Hepburn, he says: ''Use the inside tube of a loo roll, cut it in half,
then [1/2] cuts in one end to splay out like flower petals. Gather up
all, or a section of your hair, feed through the tube securing the
'petals' to your head with kirby grips, then fan out your hair over the
tube securing with more clips.'' Simple.
But the thing is, toilet roll tubes are bio-degradable. First, you
must cover the cardboard petals with sticky-backed plastic to avoid
mushing. Think ahead. After all, what are you going to say, when people
stop inviting you to parties. ''Oh, forgive me,'' as flakes of grey
paste seep through your glamorous bouffant and smear your face, ''it's
only my new scalp-pack working.'' Get organised. Get going. Get a life.
Hair Tips from Taylor Ferguson:
* Give hair a textured look after drying by mixing equal parts of
mousse and gel together and working through the entire head.
* To give width at the sides, use a vent brush to hold hair from head,
and hairspray, then hold until dry. You can raise a fringe too, in this
way.
* When colouring grey hair use half-strength tints. This allows a
little white to shine through, making a more natural look, and reducing
re-growth problems.
* When drying curly or permed hair, lift roots with a vent brush then
apply mousse or blow-drying spray and finish drying with a low heat. Use
heated or velcro rollers to glam up a tired perm.
* The water in your area is one of the many things that can affect the
condition of your hair. Hard water can leave a residue of chlorine that
your conditioner will find hard to overcome. After shampooing and
conditioning, try using mineral water for the final rinse. The result
will be soft and silky.
* Taylor Ferguson is located at 106 Bath Street, Glasgow.

THIS week's company is not only blazing a trail in its own right, but
is also making a very substantial contribution to trailblazing research
all over the world.
Tayside Optical Technology is a highly specialised concern, whose
staff have the technical expertise to design and manufacture thin
optical coatings (used among other things for laser systems and
components, thermal imaging, beam splitting and optical switching), and
ion-etched holographic diffraction gratings, essential components of
various pieces of advanced research equipment.
Tayside Optical Technology's customers include NASA, Brookhaven
National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the US,
IBM, AT&amp;T, the European Space Agency, the national science laboratories
in China and labs all over the world where synchroton radiation is a
powerful and extremely sophisticated tool for studying the structure of
matter and various physical, chemical and biological processes.
The company was established in 1989 as a management buy-out from
Ferranti. Two loss-making parts -- the Heston factory near Heathrow,
whose speciality was x-ray diffraction gratings, and the Dundee factory,
where optical coatings were produced -- were bought. The processes,
equipment and work in progress were all taken over and the decision made
to keep the business in Scotland, the Heston facility moving north.
Several tricky years followed. It took time and the considerable
commercial and management skills of Ian Beattie, the new managing
director who had spent 30 years in international management with
Unilever, to transform TOT into a successful company.
Beattie has built up a strong team of laser physicists and
opto-electronic graduates. On the ion-etched diffraction gratings side
of the business, every order involves a one-off design and production
process. Each member of the team is capable of producing the filters,
which can be designed on a variety of substrate materials, such as
glass, sapphire, silicon and germanicum, to the most accurate
specifications.
On the coatings side, which accounts for approximately 50% of the
business, again the standard achieved is the highest possible. Because
TOT's reputation for fulfilling difficult orders is so good, it gets a
large proportion of one-off design work, in addition to the more usual
production-line jobs.
There are only two other companies in the world capable of producing
comparably sophisticated diffraction gratings and coatings, and this
small Dundee firm is not only able to match them on quality, but also,
because of its size and consequently lower overheads, to beat them on
price as well.
In addition, TOT provides a very personal service. This, says Graeme
Robb, manager of the holographic optics department, is extremely
important in such a specialised field. Because TOT's expertise is so
highly prized, its customers, where necessary, have provided new
equipment on which orders can be made up. In return, staff aim to
produce diffraction gratings which are 100% perfect.
Another measure of TOT's success is its healthy rise in turnover since
1989. From making a loss in the early days, it has moved into profit.
Turnover has risen to #500,000 this year, and with new contracts already
in the order book, next year's business volume is expected to increase
by 70%.
Until now the optical coatings side of the business has provided the
steady income, but in the future, says Robb, the real profits will come
from the expansion in orders for diffraction gratings. Recent trips to
the US have led to large orders and there is the potential for many
more. Then three or four more graduates will be needed to join the team
of 12 which is presently blazing TOT's trail so brilliantly.

Katie Wood looks at bespoke Italy
WHEN you think about it, most package holidays really are miserable
affairs; nasty charter airlines are used to save a few quid; hotel rooms
that you wouldn't dream of entering are foisted upon you, and perfectly
normal people start behaving very strangely. An increasing number of
travellers are as a result, now opting for tailor-made holidays.
The advantage of taking a tailor-made rather than doing it all
yourself is that you benefit from the buying power of a large
organisation and you still have useful things like an airport transfer
waiting on you; your bed will be pre-booked and confirmed. Take Italy as
an example -- a wonderful country; fabulous art, brilliant food and
wine, glorious architecture, beautiful countryside, and some of the
world's greatest sightseeing. But it's not an easy country to travel in
unless you have fluent Italian, deep pockets, sharp elbows, and an even
sharper tongue. That's why an increasing number of holidaymakers are
travelling there on a package. But this is a classic example of where to
opt for tailor-made holiday.
Citalia, owned by the Italian State Railway, have been operating to
Italy for 60 years and have a wealth of experience. They run an
impressive tailor-made department.
They can put together any itinerary you want, and they have total
flexibility depending on your budget.
Being Italian-based, they have some special concessions worth knowing
about, such as holding seat allocations at La Scala, Milan, and for the
opera at Verona.
Put together your own itinerary on paper and give them a call. In 90%
of cases they will give you a costing over the phone right away with
confirmations within 24 hours.
A recent tour of some of northern Italy's highlights impressed me. A
direct flight to Verona from Glasgow was a good start -- no Heathrow
hassles. The car was waiting at the airport, just as requested (with
free guidebook to Tuscany and motor atlas). The first week was spent at
the Parc Hotel Flora in Riva -- originally a private villa, this elegant
32-room property is just 100 yards from Lake Garda. All rooms have
bathroom, colour TV, phone and safe-deposit box. There's a swimming-pool
and the owners will arrange anything from horse-riding to bike hire.
From there it was on to San Gimignano -- the magnificent traffic-free
hilltown completely enclosed by medieval walls and famed for its 14 huge
towers. This is the real Italy you dream of -- touristy, yes, but you
can avoid that by telling the tailor-made department you want a quiet
place away from the crowds. They suggested the Villa San Paolo --
converted from a nobleman's residence, it's two-and-a-half miles east of
the town. The peace of the house, the views over the Tuscan hills, and
the excellent food served at the owner's nearby restaurant were exactly
what I would have hoped to stumble across had I been touring
independently.
I left the car in nearby Florence, picked up a train (they had booked
me in first class) and headed off to Venice. To anyone who's not yet
been to Venice -- GO! There is nowhere so beautiful on earth. I had
three nights B&amp;B in the Luna Baglioni Hotel and again it came up to
scratch and proved excellent value for money.
I checked prices in each hotel and worked out that between the airfare
and the rates I had been charged by Citalia, doing the tailor-made had
actually saved me around 13%.
Yes, I thoroughly recommend a package -- but of the tailor-made
variety. It's the difference between buying a suit off the peg and
having one made to order, and for your few precious weeks off each year,
you don't want second-best, do you?

DESIGN MATTERS
Sitting on glass furniture mat require a few twists of the mind-set
but, as Clare Henry discovers, it could have its attractions
ALL that glitters is glass. This could be the slogan for InHouse's
spectacular and surprising display in Glasgow's Merchant City. Wine
goblets, milk bottles, mirrors and window panes, yes -- but a glass
table and chair? Fine for Cinderella maybe, but viewed with suspicion by
some. ''It looks fabulous but I wouldn't dare sit on it!'' observed a
friend.
InHouse pride themselves on innovation. Glass is their latest
extravaganza. Director Bill Potter says: ''It's our indulgence.'' Their
audacious approach to glass as a major structural material is spiced
with witty and irreverent vases, glasses and bowls.
The furniture is quite a shock, but what a good idea. No problem with
dirty upholstery. Just rinse and dry! In fact glass has been around for
so long, (think of Pompeii) it's a wonder it's not been done before.
Their amazing Shell table fanning into five legs under a 16mm-thick
crystal top was designed by American Danny Lane with a special macho
feel in mind while the chair in question, aptly named Ghost, is designed
by Boeri &amp; Katayanagi. Then there's a funpiece from superstar Philippe
Starck (an opaque glass top drapes over the metal frame just like a
tablecloth!) and an elegant oval floating on a simple curl to make a
coffee table.
As encore, Daum wine glasses adorned with green pate de verre cacti
await the guests.
Predictably this exciting glass is almost all made in Italy. Ettore
Sottsass, who began as an architect and formed the Memphis movement in
1981, has had a profound effect on new design and is responsible for the
most eye catching and controversial -- some would say crazy --
concoctions in primary colours.
''In Italy skilled artisans and the culture of excellence is still in
place. In the UK it's a classic case of accountants taking manufacturers
downmarket,'' says Potter.
Starck's irreverent attitude is typical of the new style which extends
from top of the range #2000 works of art to cheap and cheerful milk
glasses at #16.95 a pair.
These brightly pattered, colourful affairs, produced by Ritzenhoff in
Germany, use 40 well-known artists and architects like Ron Arad,
Nathalie du Pasquier, Kenny Scharf and Erro to create ''the most
reasonably-priced art collection in the world.
It's a lovely simple idea and works commercially,'' says Potter who,
with his wife Sylvia founded InHouse in Edinburgh in 1982, adding its
Glasgow shop in 1988.
''Our objective is to aim for excellence, to demonstrate the benefits
of quality and design and distinguish ourself from the rest of the pack
-- not just ring up the till,'' explains Potter, an architect before
opening InHouse.
''I try to source things I personally believe are special. We provide
ideas and solutions for our retail customers and complement the
architects and designers with our contract furnishing business.''
Why the interest in glass in 1995? ''Glass is taking exciting
directions via new technology. Furniture can now be created through the
unglamourous-sounding 'slump process', a combination of heat and
gravity,'' explains Sylvia.
Daum is, like Moser, Lalique and all the big names, long established.
As with many old businesses, it was in a rut and floundering till an
injection of new designers turned things around.
The outrageous and hugely talented Frenchman Philippe Starck has
designed for Daum a ravishing range of flower holders, (vase gives
entirely the wrong impression -- your auntie never had anything like
this!) which are on sale -- if you win the lottery -- at around #600.
But don't lose heart if you are broke. In 1932 the wife of architect
Alvo Aalto created a timeless set of plates, cups, glasses and dishes
that are just as popular today. At InHouse for #5.95 you can truely
aquire a ''shattering'' masterpiece.
Starck gets much of his work made in Italy. Like David Hockney, he
manages to design by fax, so that sitting in his French garden, he can
satisfy both New York hotels and his Italian craftmen. But where are the
British designers? Hey Ho.
My own memories of glass revolve around Venice and Murano, Prague, the
famous Moser factory in Karlovy, (who have provided gilded opulance for
every royal from Edward VII to the Maharajah of Baroda and the Pope)
and, by far the most fascinating, a family glassworks, Hut Jakub,
founded in 1796 and still busy after two centuries.
Part of the traditional hand-made glass tradition of Bohemia, this
tiny glassworks is hidden from the world, up a hillside amid woods in
deepest Czechoslovakia. Chickens scratch in the yard, and nothing has
changed in generations.
But it employs 100 folk making beautiful glass. As they put it,
''Honest creation descends from father to son. People from Tasice are
born with a special hand-craft knack''.
Sure enough InHouse do sell Murano and Czech glass, the later designed
by Borek Sipek whose striking, charismatic designs, (many taking their
exotic, sensuous lines from his infatuation with the far east), have won
him international acclaim.
Recently he refurbished Vaclav Havel's presidential office in Prague,
coming full circle via work in Germany and Amsterdam back to his
birthplace.
Glass has been around for more than 2000 years, but despite all the
new materials on offer, it shows no sign of ever going out of fashion.

IT may be because of the combustible mixture of his Scottish and
Spanish blood that Michael Portillo is unable to resist attacking the
cant and hypocrisy which passes for Brussels-speak.
Most Scots in the past were like this. Mealy-mouthed humbug still gets
short shrift in any Glasgow pub -- but the chattering classes, who
parade their cosmopolitanism by eating limp pasta and drinking dodgy
Rioja, seem only too willing to swallow whole any dish regurgitated in
Europe. If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel then belief that
the continentals can run their affairs better than we can is a certain
index of an inferiority complex.
Some months ago Mr Portillo had the audacity to make a speech in which
he suggested that when it came to sleaze most countries in Europe could
beat us hands down.
We know, of course, that he was only joking. He could not possibly
have been referring to the links between the Mafia and certain Italian
Prime Ministers, nor to the stench of corruption in Gonzales's Spain
which has led to the break with the Catalans, nor of the Greek Premier
Andreas Papandreou who has been presiding over a shambles of an economy
and trying politically to promote his young, busty, former air
stewardess wife.
Nor would he have known at the time that the French Prime Minister
Alain Juppe had implemented a revolutionary council house scheme for his
relatives or that the Belgian Willy Claes, now of Nato, had an
interesting line in double-entry book keeping.
Now the fascinating aspect about these individuals is that they are
not nonentities like Alan Howarth -- but senior politicians who have or
are helping shape all our tomorrows. No wonder we British feel inferior.
All we can put up against this is a gap-toothed former Heritage Minister
who had an affair with a two-bit actress.
It is odd, however, that these dynamos of Europe do not get a mention
when we are invited to plug into the continent and lighten up our dark,
dreary lives. My Greek friends can't understand why anyone should be
sceptical. On the beautiful island of Aegina, where I have a holiday
home, I am continually assailed by those locals who celebrate the
virtues of being fully European.
One farmer showed me photographs of his family home in the
Peleponnese, the southern part of Greece. The aerial view of his land is
an impressive moonscape of barren-ness punctuated by a small shrine
where his mother lies buried. ''Do you know,'' he confided in his best
John Prescott English, ''that Brussels pay me very much money for these
olive groves.'' I looked closer. ''What olive groves,'' I naively asked.
''Exactly,'' he beamed, pouring me another glass of Nemea, an
undrinkable red wine currently enjoying largesse from the European
Regional Fund.
On the way home we drove over the ''new'' road which Europe had
financed. It would have been ideal for testing those Tomahawk missiles
Mr Portillo tells us are so accurate they can slither down a chimney
stack. They would have fitted comfortably within any of the huge
potholes. ''When does the work start?'' I asked. ''They have sent us the
money and we have bought the concrete but it has, would you believe,
gone missing.''
I believed -- and admired the plush, concrete square which the town
had acquired, apparently from nowhere.
But then these are technicalities. What matters is that the Greeks
have signed up for the Social Contract -- a true test of Europeanism.
The illegal Albanian immigrants working in the kitchens, however, get
less than #2 per hour. ''We pay our Greek workers properly,'' said my
restauranteur friend proudly. ''But these are Albanians; they get
less,'' he added with impeccable Socratean logic.
How hateful then, 2000 miles away in Blackpool, that a British
Minister should indulge in demagoguery to whip up a Tory conference and
suggest that these Augean stables might be due a spring clean. How
irresponsible to lampoon Eurocrats who can't tell an olive grove from a
graveyard. But surely the most unforgiveable act is the use of satire.
Where are you now Dean Swift, Dryden, Addison, Steele?
Instead of applauding an imaginative and witty speech from Mr
Portillo, the chattering classes, brought up in the vacuum of
Tony-speak, were going into overdrive. Thank goodness Jonathan Swift was
not making his ''Modest Proposal'' at a fringe meeting! They would be
scouring the conference for a child abuser in a loin cloth and with a
bone through his nose. It would have been worse if Swift had introduced
his masterly Tale of a Tub.
''Who is this Peter, Jack, and Martin?'' the Guardian would have
demanded to know.
''They don't exist -- exclusive'' would have been the Sun's banner
headline. The sub-heading would have been more revealing: ''Julia
Carling has never heard of them. They must be friends of Di, she says.''
Swift would have understood this reaction. The pompous and pretentious
attacked him, too, especially the church. In the Land of Blair, the
muscular Christianity of New Labour resides in the brand new cathedrals
of Brussels and Strasbourg. It is there that we must worship.
Mr Portillo is a dissenter, as is the Prime Minister; but they both
realise that it is Mr Blair who has seized the pulpit.
This is what made the speech multi-dimensional. It was not simply a
question of pro and anti-Europe. Mr Major wants Europe to be an election
issue. He approved the thrust of the speech for he saw it as a clarion
call. It not only keeps the troops happy; it is, in his view, an
exercise in healthy democracy offering the electorate a choice and an
opportunity to discuss the issue which he believes will, in turn,
benefit the Tories.
Also, it was a chance for both men to spike the guns of the renegade
Redwood. To Mr Portillo this meant re-establishing his position as
leader of the right which many thought he had lost in ducking out from
the leadership fight. To Mr Major it was an opportunity to rub Mr
Redwood's nose in it.
The Prime Minister may seem kindly. But he has a ruthless streak. He
despises the man who challenged him. He wants to be certain that if he
does lose the next election, Mr Redwood will not benefit.
If, on the other hand, he wins, the former Welsh Secretary will be
seen as a busted flush and Mr Portillo will bide his time in Cabinet,
probably in a more senior post. Ironically, that Italian Machiavelli
would have been proud of him.

IN January 1986, on only his second flying lesson, Tom Johnstone was
airborne above Glasgow Airport when, at 700 feet, the engine of the
Cessna 150 packed up. ''We'll land down there,'' promised his
instructor, pointing to a field near the River Cart.
Land unscathed they did. And now, nearly 10 years on, Johnstone's
127-year-old family-owned firm has put down new roots in a Renfrewshire
industrial estate, just across the road from the scene of that earlier
emergency landing.
That coincidence does not signify a second emergency. Just a
determination to grow a long-established business in a sector where,
although demand is now more buoyant, margins are being squeezed
relentlessly.
''These days we've got to increase our turnover by quite a percentage
just to stand still,'' says Johnstone. ''As a company we've never been
more popular. We're getting all sorts of inquiries. But margins are
being forced down. So it's just as well we're now here, where we can
achieve increased efficiencies.''
All too often these days increased efficiency spells fewer jobs. But
this move, from Anniesland in Glasgow to Inchinnan, backed by a slug of
regional selective assistance, has actually created an additional 20
jobs in Thomas Johnstone, specialist joiners and shopfitters.
The efficiencies Tom Johnstone is talking about stem from relocating
from 21,000 sq ft on three floors of a former chocolate factory, with a
cramped lift connecting them, to a modern 30,000 sq ft single storey
unit, where the flow of work can be managed more productively.
Turnover jumped from #4m in 1993 to #6.2m last year. Sales are running
at a similar level this year, as the group tackles more contracts in the
#1m-plus range. If coincidences intrigue you, this growth is now being
achieved just across the road from where Scotland's only quoted
shopfitting business, Havelock Europa, used to have its main
manufacturing plant, now a bakery. Thomas Johnstone has actually
inherited the old Havelock phone number.
This is only the third factory Thomas Johnstone has inhabited in its
long history. The founder, Tom Johnstone's great-grandfather, came to
Glasgow from Maybole in 1868 and set up his jobbing joiner's business in
Sword Street, Dennistoun. Tom Johnstone thinks his ancestor, working in
the days when bills were paid twice a year, repaired windows and washing
boards for the factors of the local tenements.
His grandfather was the first to dabble in shopfitting, one of his
clients being Birrell's, the confectionery group later absorbed into RS
McColl. That drive was continued by Johnstone's father, another Thomas
who, at a sprightly 78, still comes into the plant most days in a
consultancy role.
For much of the post-war period, he tried to expand at Sword Street
but met resistance from his railway landlords. Then, in 1973, having
been given three months notice to quit, the business moved to the former
Birrell's factory in Anniesland.
Tom Johnstone says the plan to move a second time started to form in
1987, but the recession prevented action for a time. ''We thought we
couldn't afford it,'' says the present MD. But two years ago the idea
was reawakened, helped by the prospect of a Government aid package for a
move which would create additional jobs.
Inchinnan's gain is Glasgow's loss and part of a growing trend --
witness Barrs, the Irn-Bru maker, and Dunn &amp; Moore, the drinks
distributor -- of long-established city companies decamping to the
periphery. It's a trend which concerns the civic authorities, but is it
inevitable?
Johnstone says he looked at factories in Glasgow but couldn't find
anything with the kind of ground for expansion and staff parking he
needed. The Inchinnan plant, a former packaging factory, offers all
that, plus the bonus that a number of his expanding workforce are
ex-Havelock employees and hail from the Paisley area.
For a business which now works on contracts as far away as Leatherhead
in Surrey, close proximity to the motorway and the airport are also
advantages.
Having a long history and a reputation for quality work means some of
Thomas Johnstone's customers have been placing contracts with the group
for a very long time. At peak, supermarket group Safeway accounted for
more than half annual turnover, a link which goes back to the Allied
Suppliers days and the Galbraith and Cochrane store chains.
Now that share is down to around 10% with newer customers, such as
ScottishPower's retail division and fashion chain The Gap, taking up
some of the slack. Thomas Johnstone has diversified from shops into
everything from accountants' boardrooms to the new Edinburgh Sheriff
Court, hotels and bingo halls to a local dentist's reception area.
The core specialism -- fine wood finishes -- has been supplemented
down the years by a whole range of related skills. In the fifties,
Johnstone's father started an in-house electrical department to cut down
on sub-contracting delays. But in a whole range of other disciplines,
the business has built up a tried-and-tested network of sub-contractors.
For example, one current contract is the turnkey fitting out of all
the toilet facilities in the new Scottish Office building, Victoria
Quay, in Leith. One nice bureaucratic touch is that the civil service is
insisting all wall tiling lines up exactly with the floor tiling in each
unit.
How, I wonder, has this family firm -- the Johnstones still control
92.5% of the equity, with other directors holding the rest -- made it
through four generations and continued to thrive? ''Extremely hard work
during the difficult times,'' is the current MD's prescription.
His father's first instruction to his son was: get qualifications. His
next was to gain experience outside the family business. That meant a
year as a shopfitting designer for Morrison's Fashion Group, the old
Grafton and Paige chain. Then he spent four years with Glasgow District
Council's building control department. Only in 1982 was the time deemed
right for him to join the family firm.
This year's move to Inchinnan and heavy investment in computerised
design systems and new woodworking machinery leaves Thomas Johnstone
poised for bigger things. Johnstone is eyeing the Gulf, where his wife
worked for a year. This 42-year-old is planning even more new landings
in the years ahead.

* If I sell a 50% share of my #100,000 house to an insurance company
in return for a fixed-income annuity, will the rise in value of the 50%
retained be likely to offset the erosion of the annuity if inflation was
to remain under 5% for the next 10 to 15 years?
* What you are really asking is whether house price inflation will
match general inflation and this is now impossible to predict with any
degree of certainty.
Up until the present recession in the housing market, it was
reasonable to say that houses would match inflation. Indeed, they
exceeded it for many years, which is why for many people their house
also became their principal investment and was bought with this in mind.
While some in the industry still believe the good times will return, it
is arguable that the market has changed permanently.
Having said this, in Scotland it is much less volatile than in
southern England, and there will remain some link between house prices
and general inflation. But it would be unwise to assume they will match
up well in future.
* My stockbroker has suggested that we should consider transferring
our family portfolio into a nominee name to facilitate transactions and
simplify administration. It seems like a good idea, and the service is
free, but I am concerned about the security of such investments once
they have passed out of our names.
* There has been an ever-growing body of legislation and regulation to
protect investors from misuse of their investments or, to put it more
bluntly, fraud or unscrupulous salesmanship. A lot of investors do
operate under nominee names and, provided it is all tied up under the
proper regulations and you know the exact ground rules, it should not
prove a problem.
One aspect that you might consider, though, is that you may not be
able to go to company annual general meetings. Also you may not be
eligible to receive the company report and accounts. In addition, there
may be a problem or delay in depositing stock with your bank as security
against any possible future loan.
* My wife and I have recently made gifts of #10,000 to our son to help
him purchase a house. I am a little confused regarding the tax position
on these. I understand that for inheritance tax purposes #6000 of each
gift is exempt from tax, #3000 for this tax year and #3000 unused from
last. I have, however, also read that gifts such as these are tax-free
during lifetime, which suggests they will be counted as part of our
total estates on death. Can you clarify this?
* The position is that #6000 of each gift is exempt as it is covered
by the annual allowances you mention. This leaves #4000 each potentially
chargeable, but only if death occurs within seven years of making the
gift. If you both survive the seven-year period the gifts will be free
of tax and won't be included in your estate at death.
* I require advice on how or whether to continue with my self-employed
National Insurance contributions. Following the birth of my first child
my small business has been neglected and is producing profits of less
than #3000. However, I have continued to pay my Class Two contributions.
Given the speculation regarding pensions in the future I am
considering stopping these and possibly taking out a personal pension.
My only fear is that I will lose benefits, especially the basic
maternity allowance (presently #45.55), as I intend having more
children. I am 28 and my husband is the same age. He is a member of a
life company's group personal pension scheme and is contracted out of
Serps (the state earnings related pension scheme). Should I stop the
Class Two contributions? What have I to lose?
* The Department of Social Security says that a small amount of Class
Two payment may go towards Serps but the benefits are negligible. We
understand that if you do opt out of National Insurance contributions,
you will still be eligible for the maternity allowance.
On this basis, it would appear sensible to take out your own personal
pension. At retirement you would still be entitled to the basic state
pension in your present circumstances and, if not, other substitute
forms of support. However, we would suggest that you check it all
thoroughly with your local DSS office to see what possible drawbacks
there might be if your situation should change.
* My mother, who is 87, is going into a nursing home in a few months.
Like so many other people she will have to bear the entire cost of this.
Her only income is the state pension plus an attendance allowance which
together come to around #100 per week. The cost of the home is #350 a
week.
Her assets are around #30,000, #10,000 in National Savings Income
Bonds and #20,000 in shares, mainly investment trusts. She owns her own
home which could sell for around #55,000. After the sale, how should she
arrange her finances so as to pay the nursing home fees?
* The surest way to ensure your mother can afford the fees for the
rest of her life is for her to buy an index-linked annuity. A capital
sum of around #65,000 would generate an annuity of the appropriate size.
However, this would absorb a large part of her assets and, in view of
her age, this may not appeal to her.
An alternative is simply to put the fund into the highest yielding
investments and meet the difference through realising capital. Placing
the maximum #20,000 into National Savings Pensioners' Bonds and the
balance into Income Bonds would yield about #5700 net, leaving a gap of
#7300.
The capital would clearly erode rapidly and it would be safer to meet,
say, half the cost of the home through an annuity and the balance as
described. Assuming an annuity of #6000 a year, capital of around
#55,000 would remain which would generate interest income of #3860,
leaving a capital drawdown of #3100, which would be more comfortable.
* My wife and I have Tessa accounts with the Halifax (former Leeds)
Building Society which will mature in February yielding approximately
#12,000 each. In addition, we have #6000 in a Halifax (former Leeds)
instant access account, #5000 in Hydro-Electric shares and unit trusts
worth #8000 held in a PEP. We have a 15-year endowment mortgage of
#40,000 with the Halifax, fixed for five years at 9.95%. The five-year
period is due to end in August 1997.
We are inclined to reduce the mortgage at that time, but would
appreciate your thoughts on investment of the maturing Tessas in the
meantime. Bear in mind that we do not want to jeopardise the benefits
due to come our way as a result of the Halifax/Leeds merger.
* When the Tessas do mature it would be worth looking out for any
special one-year bonds that building societies and banks announce from
time to time, as they often offer a good return.
Other than that it is difficult to say where the best returns will be
available as rates offered vary -- currently Bradford &amp; Bingley Building
Society offers a 60-day postal account yielding 7.15% gross on #15,000
and over. But come February another society or bank may hold the
spotlight. It is a question of shopping around at the time.
You should not overlook National Savings, where First Option Bonds are
pretty hard to beat, offering 6.8% gross on #20,000 and over (slightly
less on smaller amounts) so long as they are held for a full year.
As for your windfall from the Halifax, the important thing is that on
the date of the meeting of members to vote on its conversion to a
company, the balance on your account should equal what it was on
November 25, 1994. This date has not yet been announced but will be
towards the end of next year and you will be given plenty of warning.
How the level varies between these dates doesn't matter, though you
should maintain a balance of at least #100.
* I took up some of my entitlement to the Laird Group rights issue
last year and sold the balance. It is possible for capital gains tax
purposes to reduce the cost of the shares bought by the amount of the
proceeds received, or must a separate calculation be done for this sale?
* The answer will depend on the value of proceeds received from the
sale of rights in relation to the value of your total remaining Laird
Group shares. If the proceeds exceed 5% of the value of the
shareholding, the sale of rights will be treated as a part-disposal for
capital gains purposes. The gain is calculated by reference to the
proceeds of sale less the apportioned cost of the original shareholding.
This apportionment calculation is done by multiplying the original
cost by the proceeds for the rights and dividing the result by these
proceeds plus the market value of the holding retained including the
part of the rights taken up. Indexation allowance is added to this
apportioned cost.
If the proceeds are small, that is less than 5% of the market value of
the remaining shares, this part-disposal calculation is not required and
the proceeds can simply be deducted from the cost of your total
shareholding thereby deferring tax on the gain until a later disposal.
If, however, you had no other disposals in the tax year or other gains
were less than the annual exemption limit, you should do the
part-disposal calculation even if the proceeds are less than 5% as the
gain would be free of tax and the cost of the remaining shares not
reduced.
* I have not yet completed my tax return for last year as there has
been a delay in obtaining all the required information. I have now
received an estimated higher rate assessment from the Inspector which,
based on my calculations, is substantially less than the tax I will be
due to pay. I have appealed the assessment and will pay the tax
requested, but should I also pay the extra at the same time in case
interest on this is charged when the final bill is issued?
* When you have been issued with a tax return form you must strictly
complete and return it to the Inspector within 30 days. The Revenue does
not enforce this time limit rigidly but its attitude in recent years has
hardened towards late returns, and the rules allow for interest and even
penalties to be charged where a late return means tax has not been paid
at the correct time. Late currently means after October 31.
In addition, when you have appealed against an estimated assessment
and the liability is later increased, interest can be charged on the
additional tax. It would, therefore, be wise to submit your return as
soon as possible and, if the assessment has not been amended before the
normal due date of December 1, you should make the further payment to
avoid any question of a charge of interest.

The Amalfi Drive is Italy's most famous, but most tourists see only
half of it. Magaret Rigillo says there is more to the Divine Coast than
Positano
VERY few foreign tourists ever visit Furore, although they pass
underneath it in their thousands. Furore is not a particularly lovely
Italian village. It has no outstanding monuments, if you don't count the
sixteenth-century triptych in the Church of St Elia, which generally
doesn't even get a mention in the guide books. It is also off the beaten
track.
To reach it you have to turn off from the celebrated Amalfi Drive at a
point between Amalfi and Conca dei Marini, and head up towards the
jagged mountain peaks which overhang the coastal road, negotiating with
due care an endless series of hairpin bends, which open up onto
breathtaking views of the Gulf of Salerno at every turn.
Up there, among the vineyards and vegetable gardens, the white houses
of Furore rise in a blaze of colour. The walls are covered in murals,
the one street is lined with painted panels and pieces of sculpture
adorn the pavements. In front of the modest two-storey town hall,
dominating the sweeping view of the sea far below, rises the colossal
monument entitled ''The Sail'' work of Neapolitan sculptor, Luigi
Mazzella. The three Mazzella brothers -- all artists -- were the first
to leave their imprint on this little-known mountain village during the
1980s. A constantly growing army of artists, both from Italy and abroad,
have been adorning Furore ever since, transforming it from an obscure
rural community into a fascinating open air museum of modern art.
Furore's odd name (it means literally ''rage'' or ''frenzy'') is said
to come from the sound of waves crashing on to the steep-sided rock
walls of the narrow gully -- they call it the Fiordo -- hundreds of feet
down below, linked to the village by a stairway of some thousand steps
cut out of the hillside. Nobody uses the stairway to the sea these days
and the fiord is no longer inhabited. The cluster of medieval stone
buildings, which were once fishermen's residences and grain and paper
mills, stand in picturesque abandonment. But not for much longer . . .
''Plans are already underway to transform the Fiordo,'' I was told by
Raffaele Porpora, of the Furore tourist office. ''The coastal area is
shortly to become a national park and the old mills will be transformed
into an arts and crafts centre.''
The artists of Furore will therefore soon be expanding down to the
sea. I was relieved, however, to learn that visitors will not be
expected to toil down the ancient, traditional route. They will most
likely be transported, in comfort, by boat from Positano or Amalfi.
The Amalfi Drive along ''the Divine Coast'' is one of Italy's star
attractions, but only part of it is well known.
Most package-tour excursions approach it from the Naples and Sorrento
end, visiting Positano, Praiano and Amalfi, and there they stop. But
they have covered only about half of the coast.
They miss the delights of a second sequence of equally spectacular
views -- to be shared with considerably less people; often, I've had the
road practically to myself. They never see the rural villages in the
craggy hinterland above Amalfi -- places like Furore, the town with the
painted walls, or Corbara, founded in 79 AD by refugees from Pompeii.
Music is the dominating art in Ravello, situated, like Furore, in the
heights above the Amalfi Drive. Unlike Furore, Ravello has been famous
for centuries. Its fairy-tale gardens have provided inspiration for
Boccaccio's Decamerone and Wagner's Parsifal, as well as for Lady
Chatterley's Lover, The Third Man and Peer Gynt.
Famous romances have blossomed here in Ravello's secluded grand
hotels. Greta Garbo and composer Leopold Stokowski stole secret holidays
at the Hotel Caruso; Escher met his wife, Jette, at the Toro.
The summer Wagner recitals in the grounds of Villa Rufolo -- which he
called ''the enchanted garden of Klingsor'' -- are a time-honoured
institution. Less well-known are the Chamber Music Weeks in the spring
and autumn, where international chamber groups and soloists perform amid
the scented shrubs and flowerbeds to a select and discerning audience,
which may well include a long-standing resident, American writer, Gore
Vidal. During the interval, we sipped the local lemon liquor and chatted
to the Salzburg Soloists, who had treated us to a Beethoven Serenata on
a balmy autumn evening.
Beyond Amalfi, on the way to Salerno, are the charming fishing
villages of Atrani and Cetara, with their fishing nets spread out to dry
in front of the houses. There are little-known beaches like Erchie,
dominated by an old Saracen watch tower, where we had a memorable fish
lunch at an unpretentious little family establishment built right on the
sand.
There are all kinds of fascinating and unsung sights like the
magnificent remains of an ancient Roman millionaire's seaside holiday
home at Minori and a medieval castle built into the rocks at Maiori.
The last little town at the Salerno end of the Amalfi Drive is Vietri
sul Mare, renowned for its ceramics, where master craftsmen like Carmine
Falcone and his brothers have always lived and worked together in the
family pottery.
Carmine's shop is right on Vietri High Street and few passers-by can
resist stopping off to see him. Entering Carmine's shop is like going
into Aladdin's cave. There are no windows and the sun streams in through
the open doorway, lighting up the rows upon rows of gaily-coloured
ceramic vases, basins, dishes, tiles, figurines, cups, beakers, fruit
bowls and cache-pots stacked on tables, shelves and the floor. The
entire shop front is covered in an exuberant display of floral tiles.
Reaching behind his work bench, as he chatted to me, he dipped his
hand into a sack of wet grey clay and broke off a small piece, nimbly
fashioning a tiny donkey -- which, he explained, is the symbol of his
home town.
Carmine may not have travelled much, but the plates he creates have
journeyed far and wide. The Falcone hand-decorated ceramics are exported
all over the world and grace the households of such people as Pope John
Paul and the President of Italy.
''This big car pulled up at the door one day,'' he told me, delicately
pulling out the donkey's ears. ''And this lady got out and came in to
have a look around. She said she wanted to buy a 12-place dinner service
and she chose one like this'' -- he showed me a pale green pottery plate
decorated with dancing peasants.
''Well, I didn't know who she was and I was worried she would get a
shock when I told her the price.
''These cost a lot of money, I told her. They're all fired in the old
traditional way -- in wood-fuelled kilns. They're practically
indestructable! And then they're all hand-painted. We generally sell
them individually. I tried to show her some less expensive models, but
she said she had made up her mind. Afterwards I learned that she was the
Queen of Sweden.''
He chuckled, shaking his head, and gave me the donkey as a present.

Dead ringers
for pop stars
SIMPLY Dead is their name, and according to the lady answering their
phone, they couldn't have picked a more accurate title.
Gordon Hunter, the band's lead singer, and Ryden's investment partner,
handles such comments with the ease of a seasoned professional.
''We had thought of changing the band's name to The Disclaimers but
we've decided to stick with Simply Dead.''
The four-piece outfit has an air of solid property about it as the
other members are Euan Matheson, from Ryden's Glasgow office, ex-Ryden
staffer Alasdair Coates, now with Mason Owen, and Bruce Lindsay, a
chartered surveyor with Lanham Developments.
They are in the process of producing their first CD, entitled Men
Barely Alive, which Gordon Hunter describes somewhat elliptically as ''a
radical departure from the traditional pre-conceptions of a
post-Thatcher property market''.
Simply Dead have just completed a ''major tour'', the highlight of
which was the 40th birthday bash of Peter Gubb, the managing director of
property investment company the Highcross Group, at the Donnington
Valley Hotel.
The fabulous four are going back into the recording studio in Glasgow
later this year to complete the remaining tracks on their album which
they describe as ''reversionary'' in style. They hope to have Men Barely
Alive available for their fans next spring.
In the meantime, anyone interested in booking the band can contact
Hunter at Ryden's Edinburgh office on 0131 225 6612, where the
switchboard operator, realising that she was going to be quoted in
Business Diary, tried to change her story by saying: ''No, they really
are wonderful . . .''
Reel thing at
Trades Hall
TO prove that Business Diary has a varied taste in music we draw your
attention to the ceilidh which is being held on Saturday, October 28, in
the Trades Hall on Glassford Street, Glasgow.
The event is being organised by hall officer Denis Findlay, who has
booked the popular Clachnacuddent for the evening. Tickets costs #10 and
can be obtained from him on 0141 552 2418 with all proceeds going to the
Trades Hall renovation fund.
While on the subject of the Trades Hall, I am sure Business Diary
readers will want to congratulate the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Tommy
Dingwall, on being enrolled as an honorary craft member of the
Incorporation of Gardeners.
The Trades have also elected Dr W Morton Fyfe as the new Deacon
Convener of the Trades of Glasgow, a post which makes him the city's
third citizen.
Labour dines
on success
THE new Labour Party is certainly cultivating the business world these
days, and is in danger of getting fat on it too.
Next month, Business Diary is told, George Robertson is addressing a
lunch organised by the Scottish Industry Forum, while in December
companies are being invited to pay #1000 for a table of 10 at the annual
gala dinner which will be addressed by Tony Blair. To provide some light
relief, Richard Wilson, star of One Foot in the Grave, will also address
the gathering.
Later this month, Robertson is the main speaker at the Lanarkshire
Business Awards dinner organised by Lanarkshire Development Agency and
sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland and this paper.
Scottish Financial Enterprise has also organised a programme of
private briefing meetings between Labour front bench spokesman George
Robertson and Alistair Darling and small groups of senior figures from
the Scottish financial services industry.
The meetings follow Sir Bruce Pattullo, the Governor of the Bank of
Scotland's, remarks at an SFE dinner in London last year when he called
for dialogue between the business community and the parties proposing
constitutional change in Scotand.
Tarzan has
pulling power
IT is not only the Labour Party that is dining with the Scottish
business community; the Conservatives are also getting in on the act,
and Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine is proving to be a big
attraction at the SFE autumn dinner on November 20 in the new Edinburgh
conference centre.
Grant Baird, executive director of SFE, tells me there will be 750 at
the meal, and the SFE has had to turn several dozen away. The event
normally attracts around 400, which is an indication of the pulling
power of Tarzan.
Weekend of
Chinese torture
BUSINESS Diary has received another epistle from our China
correspondant who has just returned from the Chinese equivalent of our
autumn long weekend.
He writes: ''A weekend out of China is a rare and precious thing.
However, my recent trip to Manila and Hong Kong was an absolute
disaster.
''Last Sunday was National Day and we had four days of holiday. I had
arranged to fly to Manila on the Saturday to conduct some interviews.
Sunday I planned to spend by the hotel swimming pool. A short flight on
Monday morning would then give me a day in Hong Kong before flying back
to Beijing on Tuesday.
''Sounds great doesn't it? Well it didn't work out that way at all.
The first inkling that all was not well came as my flight approached
Manila, and it became clear that we were running into a typhoon. It was
a rough approach and landing, not made easier by the actions of the
little lady sitting next to me. She alternated between clutching my
hand, and praying loudly to the virgin and various saints to get us down
safely.
''The time in Manila was miserable. Unable to go out of the hotel, I
was more bored than if I had stayed in Beijing. On the Monday morning as
I was leaving for the airport the sun came out.
''The flight to Hong Kong normally takes a litte over one hour, this
time it took more than three. The reason, as you have probably guessed,
was that the blasted typhoon had moved to Hong Kong.
''Hong Kong is always an 'interesting' airport to land at with a
difficult approach. This time it was spectacular. On finally landing our
captain (obviously with the adrenaline still flowing) informed us that
the two aircraft ahead of us and the one following had aborted. He went
on to say that, in his 25 years of flying this was by far the most
difficult landing he had made. On reflection I rather wish he had not
told us that.
''The stay in Hong Kong was similar to Manila -- miserable. The
weekend was, however, consistent; even the flight back to Beijing was in
keeping. On Tuesday, after an endless delay and speculation as to
whether we would fly at all, we boarded our Air China flight. We were
then kept sitting on the runway, with no air conditioning, and the
humidity in the high nineties for three hours before taking off.
''Only those who have flown on Chinese airlines can understand the
true horror of this. So much for my restful and relaxing weekend.''
Sounds like Chinese torture to me.

ABBEY Life is offering a cheaper version of its Living Assurance
critical illness policy which will pay out only for three illnesses,
cancer, heart attack and stroke, and also on death. Premiums are about
half the those charged for its standard Living Assurance policy which
covers a much wider range of illnesses.
Abbey Life says the reason for offering the new cheaper version, which
is called Living Assurance Select, is that the vast majority of the #28m
of claims it has paid out on so far have related to these three major
conditions. The policy is unit-linked, giving a surrender value whenever
it is cashed in without a claim being made. For further information, you
can call Abbey Life's customer service line on 01202 407149.
AHEAD of ''make a will'' week, IFA Promotion, which supports the
activities of independent financial advisers, is urging the estimated
two-thirds of adults who have not yet made a will to do so. It points
out that without one administration of an estate is more difficult and
it makes inheritance tax planning virtually impossible. If, on the other
hand, a will has been made, the tax can be mitigated in various ways.
A LODGEMENT service for wills has been launched by a new company,
Central Wills Lodgement Bureau. For a one-off fee of #19.99 it will
register that a will has been made and where it is located. The customer
receives a registration certificate together with a credit card-sized
information card. Solicitors and executors can check if there is a will
by making a single phone call. More information can be obtained by
calling 0345 697824.
PREMIER Fund Managers has launched its SW Premier Selector Income
Trust modelled on its Selector Trust growth fund. The new fund will have
a yield of 5.3% initially with income paid quarterly. It will be
invested 65% in equities and 35% in income unit trusts. The minimum
investment is #1000. Charges are 6% initial and 1.5% annual, taken from
capital. Futher details can be obtained by calling 01483 306090.
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society is trimming interest rates on
most of its savings accounts. Rates on investment accounts, excluding
the London Account, will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points. A tiered
structure has been introduced on the London Account, so that rates start
at 5.5% gross for balances between #2500 and #9999 and increase to 6% on
more than #100,000.

SO much for the Australian climate. As a welcome, the city managed to
experience its first snowfall in 26 years. Like the English, when
Australians say they had snow, they meant that someone saw a snowflake.
Enough to still the traffic, right enough, but nowhere near the average
Scottish freeze.
Melbourne is quite unlike Sydney. Sydney plays America to Melbourne's
Europe, and Melbourne retains an air of superiority, enjoying a
cultured, more relaxed, less loopy way of life than that exhibited by
its rival.
The pace of life here is far from frenetic, and the city, indicative
of the low cost of real estate and the amount of accessible land,
continues to expand outwards. With this much country, who needs
greenbelts? Within two hours' drive of Melbourne's centre there are
beaches, deserts, and ski resorts -- an incredible variety of country.
Despite its huge size, and impressive surroundings, I found Melbourne
to be a rather parochial place, being relatively uninterested in what
was going on outside the state, never mind about the world. The media
remains slavishly dedicated to sport, making the Scottish press's
interest in football seem like a passing fad.
In order to sell, a minimum of 94% of each newspaper has to be devoted
to sport: gossip, sportsmen's private lives, it doesn't matter as long
as it's sport. Just to be awkward, Melbourne's favourite game is played
almost nowhere else in the world. Melbourne, until a few years ago, was
the only place where Aussie rules football (or, as they call it,
''foody'') was played.
While I was there, the season was just building up to a climax and, I
must admit, it was rather engaging. After watching one of the games on
TV, Brad was ecstatic. ''Bet you've nothing like this at home, eh?'' We
do have similar activities, but we traditionally call them gang fights.
Foody is similar to rugby, but only in the same way that a schoolboy
scrap is similar to an SAS raid. By the looks of it, it was probably
devised by two lots of pub regulars wanting a way of having a legalised
''square go''.
We managed to inveigle a few tickets for the big game at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, a 100,000-seater stadium which is in contrast to the
genteel connotations of the name. The rules were explained to me, which
took about 30 seconds.
The main idea is to kick the ball through the middle two posts at
either end of the huge oval ground, meanwhile causing as much physical
damage to the opposition as possible. Passing is done by either kicking
the ball or punching it out of the hand. Tackling is by . . . well,
whatever you want really. There are 18 people in each team, in keeping
with the ''barney in sports gear'' ethos, and the only constraints on
play are: no grabbing round the neck, and no pushing in the back.
From what I saw, it was OK to punch an opponent firmly on the coupon
in full view of the ref, and taking a big runny-up to allow maximum
force to the ensuing kick in the groin was positively encouraged. All
the players wear cap-sleeve T-shirts, making them look as if there had
been a ram-raid on the Top Man warehouse sometime in the mid-eighties.
It certainly wasn't like any football match that I'd ever been to. The
sun shone, the crowd sang clean songs, the beer was nicely chilled, and
the huge screens gave out instant action replays of all the best bits
(disembowellings, that sort of thing).
''Commitment'' is one commonly used euphemism for the players'
attitude, the sort of commitment that the Kray twins used to display
when playing at home. The referee is supposed to be in charge but I
don't know what you have to do to get booked here: I suspect it would
involve an unlicensed firearm, or a medieval pike. As the huge crowd
sang, shouted, and bayed for blood, we enjoyed it. We were laughing,
too. It was funny watching people releasing their everyday tensions,
getting angry, when all the time I knew  it didn't really matter.
It's a great game: a hard, fast, physically demanding and exciting
game, but it just wasn't the sort of thing that got my heart racing. At
least 99,000 Australians would disagree with me, though.
On the Thursday I went in to find a fax pinned up. It was addressed to
''Fat Boy Leach'' and all it said in huge letters was, ''Ha Ha! Celtic 0
McCoist 1 -- No Holy Water in the Cup!'' I was half a world away. I was
laughing, but it was still bad news. The secretaries thought it was
hilarious. Imagine getting worked up about a game of soccer!

THE cut-throat mortgage market is dealing savers a very rough hand
indeed with the rates they receive down by around half a percentage
point since the beginning of October. For example, Halifax's benchmark
Liquid Gold account is paying taxpayers just 0.75% on amounts under
#500, and for #5000 the return is only 2.89%, which is below the rate of
inflation. Even shifting your #5000 over to the popular Solid Gold
90-day notice account will only get you 3.23%.
Rates like these mean National Savings are now worth a second glance.
The Investment Account pays gross interest of 5.25% on between #20 and
#500, 5.75% between #500 and #25,000, and above that the rate is 6%. The
minimum investment is #20, the maximum #100,000, and you must give a
month's notice of withdrawal. The interest is paid gross, but is
taxable. This reduces the return on #5000 for basic rate taxpayers to
4.3%, which is still better than most building societies are paying.
The Ordinary Account has less to recommend it, unless you are a very
small saver or a higher rate taxpayer. The interest rate is 2% which
beats most building societies on amounts of less than #500. If you keep
your account going for more than a year, the rate rises to 3.25% if you
have more than #500 in it.
Higher rate taxpayers in search of tax breaks like the Ordinary
Account because the first #70 of interest is tax-free. You need to
invest just over #2000 to earn #70 but for the higher rate taxpayer this
is the equivalent of 5.42%, which again is hard to find from a High
Street bank or building society. You can open an Ordinary Account with
#10 and you can make instant withdrawals of up to #100 a day at any post
office and #250 a day from a nominated one. The maximum investment is
#10,000.
National Savings certificates are tax-free and offer attractive rates
to taxpayers who can tie up their savings for five years. They come in
two varieties: the 42nd issue offers a return of 5.85% and the 8th issue
of index-linked certificates pays 3% above inflation, currently running
at 3.9%.
The 42nd issue is worth 7.8% to basic rate taxpayers and 9.75% to
higher rate payers, and at the current rate of inflation the 8th
index-linked issue is worth 8.8% to basic rate payers and 11% to higher.
The minimum investment in both issues is a relatively modest #100 and
the maximum is #10,000, unless you are reinvesting maturing certificates
when you can put in a further #20,000.
Since 20 September you no longer have to buy savings certificates in
blocks of #25. After making an initial investment of #100 you can add
any amount to your investment so long as it is more than #100. This also
applies to reinvestment. It used to be the case that money was
reinvested to the nearest #25 and any surplus was sent separately as a
cheque. This was irritating for people who wanted to use the full
amount.
Anyone with children should be putting money into issue G of
Children's Bonus Bonds. The maximum investment is only #1000 for each
child under 16 but the interest rate of 7.5% is tax free if the bonds
are kept for five years. Investment in issues A to E was restricted to
#1000 in total. After that the rules were changed and a further #1000
was permitted in issues F and G. So if you invested in any of the
previous issues you can now put a further #1000 into issue G. The only
disadvantage is that the money belongs to the child.
Pensioners' Bonds, Series 2, are most attractive to non-taxpayers. You
must be over 65 and the interest, which is paid monthly, is fixed at
7.5% for five years. The minimum investment is #500 and the maximum is
#20,000.
Income Bonds, First Option Bonds and Capital Bonds are all taxable and
are also designed for non-taxpayers. Capital Bonds offer a fixed return
of 7.75% over five years. The interest is paid when the bonds mature,
but taxpayers will be put off by having to pay the tax each year even
though it has not yet been received.
Premiums Bonds have been National Savings' big success story in recent
years. More than #3000m has been poured into them since the jackpot was
raised to #1m at the end of 1993. The minimum holding is #100 and the
maximum is #20,000. The prizes are worth 5.2% of the fund.
But a word of warning, the Government only needs National Savings to
raise #2500m this year, which is around one tenth of the total borrowing
requirement. National Savings says it is on target, but if there is a
sudden inflow of funds, the organisation will be under pressure to lower
interest rates to the point where they are less competitive.

RUMOURS that the Government is to double taxes on home, car and
medical insurance premiums in the November Budget sound bad enough.
What's worse is that an increase may well coincide with the end of a
long run of cost cutting on insurance premiums.
Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the telephone-based
insurance subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said recently that
the motor premium cycle was ''at the bottom'' and that in six months
increases would begin to feed through.
That may come as a relief to other motor insurance companies who have
been forced to cut rates, suffering lower profits in the process,
following the success of the new-style direct insurers, but it won't be
at all welcome to policyholders, particularly if the Government adds to
the burden with tax increases.
Insurance premium tax (IPT) was introduced last October at 2.5%,
although insurance companies believe the Government is set to double
that level to 5%.
It affects motor, household, medical and travel policies as well as
mortgage payment protection policies. These have become far more
important since cutbacks in state aid for unemployed borrowers took
effect at the beginning of this month.
''The tax may not have had much of an impact so far on spending
because it came in at a time of competition for business and falls in
premium rates -- so its effect has been minimised by premium
reductions,'' says the Association of British Insurers.
''But there will come a day when premiums start to go up and if IPT is
raised to a higher level that could well start to affect the type and
amount of insurance people buy. The worst aspect of this type of tax is
that it hits less well off families most.''
This is borne out by the latest figures from the Family Expenditure
Survey, which show that the lowest paid 20% of the population spend more
than 5% of their pre-tax income on motor insurance, for instance, while
the highest paid 20% spend less than 1.5%.
The big worry for the future is that a combination of increases in
both basic premiums and the tax payable on them may prevent
policyholders from buying an adequate amount of insurance -- and deter
many from having some types of insurance at all.
At present more than a million motorists -- accounting for around 5%
of the 20 million vehicles on the road -- fail to insure their cars,
even though it is a requirement of the Road Traffic Act.
''In terms of total compensation paid to the victims of untraced and
uninsured motorists, this costs motor insurers and their policyholders
in the order of #250m a year,'' says the ABI. It is urging the
Government to implement a series of measures designed to crack down on
uninsured motorists.
Motor insurance premiums are already set to rise by 3% because of
proposed changes to the way victims of car accidents are compensated.
And with a rise in both premium rates and IPT in the pipeline, now is
the time to make sure you are getting the best value for money.
That can be as easy as asking a broker to check out different policies
for you, but with so many telephone-based direct sell companies around
these days, it makes sense to do your own telephone research too.
If you're not confident about what to ask and what you should be
looking out for, then a new book, The Insider's Guide to Direct Motor
Insurance, could be very useful.
''Most people choose a policy without first deciding what they really
need,'' says author Jonathan Wolfe, who used to work for one of the UK's
largest direct insurance companies. ''But if you want the best deal it's
up to you to ask extra questions.
''An insurance salesperson won't want to give you too many different
prices because the more options you're given the more chance there is
that you won't take the policy there and then because you'll need to
think about it.''
If cost increases lead to even more uninsured cars on the road, then
the addition of legal expenses insurance to motorists' policies is set
to assume a more important role.
''In my opinion, if you want to be properly insured, you must have
some form of legal expenses cover, although many motorists don't take it
up because they want to save money,'' says Mr Wolfe.
''It's particularly important for drivers who have only got third
party, fire and theft cover (or third party only). Any damage to their
own vehicles is not covered by their own insurance company. Even if the
accident was not your fault it's up to you to sort it out yourself and
get your repair costs back. If you've got the legal cover insurance, you
can pay for a solicitor's help.''

Ronnie Black makes a hard-hitting and passionate call for the revival
of Scotland's Celtic inheritance
THE 10th International Congress of Celtic Studies (10-ICCS) took place
recently in Edinburgh. Participants from all over the world chatted,
sunned themselves, or scurried from hall to hall under the friendly
slopes of a mountain named after a hero who may perhaps have been a
British, and thus Celtic, king of the sixth century -- Arthur's Seat.
Organised by Edinburgh University's tiny Department of Celtic
(permanent academic staff -- three) the congress attracted almost 600
delegates from 30 countries, with sizable contingents from Spain,
Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan in addition to the more obvious
countries like Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the US, Canada, and Germany.
With 240 papers read over four days, described in a programme of 160
pages, it was certainly the largest congress of Celtic studies ever. A
juggernaut that had threatened to go out of control, its ultimate
success was due to the faith of Edinburgh University and Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, along with some splendid teamwork, including
the Department of Celtic's huge ''International Brigade'' of
postgraduate students. Other statistics attest to the economic might of
Celtic studies, for example James Thin's turnover of almost #10,000 in
five days at the 10-ICCS bookshop -- and it was only one of several
booksellers represented.
Edinburgh was always going to be a popular venue. The congress is held
every four years, and the Scottish capital is the only city it has
graced twice since its inception in 1959. The event had many qualities
of a festival and allowed Scotland to claim its place on the map at the
centre of academic Celtic studies.
The academic programme of 10-ICCS took shape rapidly a year ago as
responses to the First Call flooded in from universities everywhere. The
flood was gratifying and unstoppable. It was soon clear that this mass
of material, much of it by young scholars, offered a conspectus of the
scope and state of academic Celtic studies today and tomorrow.
The congress demonstrated the international strength of Celtic
studies, as compared with its national weaknesses. In this respect it
mirrored the experience of Celtic peoples over 3000 years -- in a world
of empires, nation states, and corporations, the Celts have always found
themselves perpetuating an alternative lifestyle, a people-based
society, the supremacy of individual, family, and community over
purpose-built organisations.
Questions of identity were also to the fore. They were brought into
focus by papers on ''Celticity'', debates between archaeologists and
linguists, and the inability of some reporters to understand what on
earth the congress was about. How come we were called ''Celtic
enthusiasts coming to research our roots'' when the participants in an
academic conference on molecular physics would hardly be called
''physics enthusiasts coming to research their molecules''? What is
wrong? And does this problem have something to do with my previous
paragraph?
Let me be clear, then. Celtic studies is an academic discipline
gathering together the eight strands of knowledge described above, or
Celtic aspects of them. ''Celtic'' is a handy collective term for a
people who have inhabited Europe for over 3000 years of recorded
history. We have taken it from the Greek Keltoi, meaning ''people who
are not Greek''. The definition of ''Celt'' is a linguistic one: a
''Celt'' is a speaker of a Celtic language, or the descendant of a
speaker of a Celtic language.
Scotland is over half Celtic, and thus Celtic. Countries like England,
France, Spain, and Hungary are not Celtic, but were Celtic once, and
still hold much of interest to the Celticist in matters archaeological,
linguistic, historical, onomastic.
Countries like Australia, Canada, and the US are not Celtic but have
become partly so in modern times and contain much of interest to the
Celticist in matters historical, linguistic, literary, ethnological.
As for ''fringes'', they are in the mind. If Celtic studies is your
discipline, the Celtic world is in the centre, other worlds are on the
periphery. Ask one of our Japanese or Russian delegates about that, c/o
the Japanese Association of Celtic Studies or the Russian Association of
Celtic Studies. They have no hang-ups.
''A speaker of a Celtic language, or the descendant of a speaker of a
Celtic language.'' The known Celtic languages of the ancient world were
Gaulish (in France), Lepontic (in northern Italy), Celtiberian (in
northern Spain), Brythonic, Brittonic, or British (in Britain), Pictish
(in northern Scotland), and Goidelic or Gaelic (in Ireland).
Beyond these it is safest simply to say ''Celtic'' when speaking of
the language of Celtic-speaking inhabitants of Germany, say, or Hungary,
or Turkey (the Galatians), because we possess no substantial texts from
these places and have thus no real evidence of features distinct from
Gaulish, Lepontic, or Celtiberian. Many of these ancient Celtics were
nomadic anyway, ranging free across the hills and plains of Central
Europe as far as Greece and Asia Minor.
So many countries of Europe (and Asia Minor) have a ''Common Celtic''
strand in their heritage, blending with their Italic, Germanic, Slavic
(or Turkic) background.
This was recognised by the Fiat Motor Company four years ago when it
sponsored a lavish exhibition in Venice's Palazzo Grassi entitled I
Celti -- ''The Celts, the Origins of Europe''. Delegates to 10-ICCS had
bus trips to the Borders, Pictland, or Inveraray, or a sail on Loch
Lomond; the sun shone Italian-style and they were more than happy.
The book of the exhibition, two inches thick, sumptuously illustrated,
and available in different languages, was presented free to each 9-ICCS
delegate. It explains that the Venice exhibition ''was conceived with a
mind to the great impending process of the unification of western
Europe, a process that pointed eloquently to the truly unique aspect of
the Celtic civilisation, namely its being the first historically
documented civilisation on a European scale. In fact, how else could a
people who fanned out from the central-eastern regions of Europe all the
way to the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, and even as far as the
Black Sea, be described except in terms of their common European
denominator? We felt, and still feel, that linking that past to this
present was in no way forced but indeed essential, and could very
effectively call us back to our common roots.''
The Celts never really had a state, and certainly never had an empire:
when they gained statehood, as in medieval Scotland or in modern
Ireland, it was by adopting non-Celtic institutions and mechanisms of
government. The proof of this point is simple: they dropped their Celtic
language like a hot brick, and with it their value system, their
inheritance, and their identity.
Which brings us to modern Celtic languages. There are six, falling
into two groups. From the Brythonic come Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.
From Goedelic come Irish, Scottish, Gaelic, and Manx. All of these are
in every sense alive except Cornish, whose last native speaker died in
1777, and Manx, whose last native speaker died in 1974.
That this information has to be provided in a Scottish newspaper is an
indictment of our education system; the six Celtic languages should be
as well known as the Seven Deadly Sins or the Ten Commandments, but they
aren't.
''A speaker of a Celtic language, or the descendant of a speaker of a
Celtic language.'' Scotland is a Celtic country on both counts, in some
ways the richest. Like Ireland, Wales, and Brittany, we still possess
the priceless asset of a living Celtic language -- and it is our
greatest national treasure.
But, to a greater extent than any other country outside the New World,
we also possess a multi-ethnic heritage. When St Columba arrived in Iona
from Ireland in 563AD he found a territory which, north of Hadrian's
Wall, was shared about equally by four peoples in a way that can be
shown by two quick slashes on the map, forming a cross.
In the north-west, his own people: the Scots, newly arrived. In the
north-east, the Picts, long established. In the south-east, the
Anglians, newly arrived. In the south-west, the Britons, long
established.
The Picts spoke Pictish, seemingly a Celtic language with pre-Celtic
elements. The Britons spoke British, also known as Brythonoc, Brittonic,
Cumbric, or Welsh. The Scots spoke Gaelic, which by the tenth century
had imposed itself upon the rest to become a sort of national tongue.
And the Anglians spoke a form of English, the only Germanic language of
the four, which by the twelfth century had in turn imposed itself upon
the rest to become a second sort of national language.
I should also add that Christianity brought a little Latin (an Italic
language) to all these peoples, and that the Norsemen arrived in 800AD,
throwing a second Germanic language into the pudding. Total: six
languages from three different groups.
The tasks of Celtic studies in Scotland are to understand and nurture
this complex inheritance; to comprehend its relationships with Ireland,
with Wales, with what came before, and with present-day reality; and to
plan for its future.
Scotland owes a great deal to its Celtic inheritance. Its national
imagery is Celtic. Its national drink. Its national dress. Its national
music. Its clans. Its scenery, even.
But the giving has all been one-way. That verb owes has a much
overworked meaning. It means that something should be paid back. Those
who have given these things to Scotland have mostly been robbed of their
land and their language, and thus of all the riches that these two
precious things contain.
It makes me shiver in disgust to see the twin inheritance has been
violated and cast aside. What of a twisted legal system which declares
that the people who live on the land don't own it -- a concept to which
the Gael subscribed in their own philosophy -- then goes on to say: Aha,
but someone else owns it!
What of churches who feed upon a people's natural spirituality, then
toss away the vessel which contains that spirituality so that it all
drains away into arid soil?
What of newspapers which make thousands a year out of Gaelic-related
job advertising but never print a word of the language editorially?
What of TV companies who won't put a penny of their own money into
Gaelic programmes even though television swept the ceilidh off the
hearth?
What of an education system that paid for manpower to thrash Gaelic
out of children with the tawse but won't pay for manpower to put it back
with love?
So much debt, so much to be paid back. The honest creditors are the
people, those who must pay them back are purpose-built organisations.
Still, organisations are people, and the way ahead is through
partnership. I would like to see a university-led strategy for Celtic
studies in Scotland which involves these agencies:
* Local authorities (archaeological digs, accurate bilingual
signposting).
* Gaelic promotional bodies (to find ways of getting through the
manpower bottleneck).
* Scots language interests (to evolve policies of mutual benefit).
* Schools (national policies, tailored to regional needs, for
Gaelic-medium education, Gaelic as a second language and Celtic
studies).
* Tourism organisations (Celtic studies offer a cohesive
presentational framework that makes sense of our identity, bringing
together everything from archaeological sites to Pictish symbols and
place names).
* Museums and heritage centres (they should handle languages as
skilfully as Glasgow's St Mungo Museum of religion, and present their
subject through aboriginal eyes as sensitively as the Trimontium Roman
Exhibition in Melrose).
* The media (to call Celtic peoples ''we'', speak of Gaelic as ''our
language'', stop saying ''remote'', and pronounce place names
correctly).
These thoughts were provoked by our academic festival under Arthur's
Seat. Our delegates were clearly enthralled by the mostly-hidden ethnic
riches of our country.
Let us make sure that by the time ICCS comes back to Scotland --
perhaps not till 2023 -- arrangements like these are firmly in place.
They are (almost incidentally) the context which provides the Gaelic
language with its future, and a secure one at that.

A 30-year-old would have to start saving #270 a month now to give him
or herself a pension worth around #10,000 at today's purchasing power
IT'S time to worry about your retirement income if you have not
already started doing so. As this idea catches on and people stop
yawning about pensions, the already huge business of providing them will
grow even faster.
The experts tell us that the relative value of the state pension will
continue to decline, as it has been ever since the basis of calculating
it was changed from relating it to average wages to relating it to the
Retail Price Index. Mysteriously, the Retail Price Index, often called
the cost of living index, always seems to grow more slowly than average
wages -- which is, of course, the reason why the basis for calculating
the pension was changed.
It is becoming clearer all the time that we are going to have to rely
less on the state and more on ourselves if we want to eat, drink and be
reasonably merry in our old age. The state is just not going to be able
to afford to do anything other than let its OAPs fall further and
further behind and hope that private enterprise will fill the gaps.
The latest idea in pensions, a business currently dominated by life
assurance companies, is to harness invest trust companies, and the
latest organisation to enter is Fleming Investment Management. Fleming
runs 18 investment trusts and has some #3900m of funds under management.
''There is an increasing awareness that the Government is pulling
back,'' says director Daniel Godfrey, ''but there have been dramatic
decreases in the volumes of pension business being written by the
traditional providers. The impact of commissions disclosure and the
publicity over miss-selling seems to be putting people off.''
And on charges he says: ''People want their money to work for them not
the pension companies. They want low-cost investments which are more
likely to produce the long-term returns which will secure their standard
of living in the future.''
He points out that the state pension of #58.85 is now less than one
sixth of the national average wage and only around half the working
population, 11 million people, are in company schemes.
Providing your own pension means tucking away quite a lot of money.
Fleming says a typical calculation shows that a 65-year-old man with a
60-year-old wife wanting to buy an annuity to bring them an income of
around #9800 would need to have accumulated a fund of #100,000. And a
30-year-old would have to start saving #270 a month now to give him or
herself a pension worth around #10,000 at today's purchasing power.
The tax authorities help. Up to the age of 36 you can put 17.5% of
your taxable earnings into a plan tax-free. The proportion rises to a
maximum of 40% for those aged 61 to 74.
The two things which can most affect the final value of your fund, and
thus the pension you will be able to draw, are the charges you have to
pay and the investment performance of the fund you choose. Claiming its
charges are ''low'', Fleming says a #200-a-month investment growing at
9% over 10 years would produce a final value of #35,353 with charges
reducing the return from 9% to 8%.
Quoting illustrations by five life companies, it says that compares
with figures ranging from #33,900 to #31,800. The figures simply show
the effect of charges as they all assume the same rate of growth,
although in practice some will outpace others.
Fleming is the third big investment trust group to get into the
pensions business. Foreign &amp; Colonial and Dunedin plus several unit
trust groups have already moved in and others are likely to follow.
Typical charges for all three investment trust groups are a #100 set-up
payment followed by annual fees of #50 plus 0.5% of the value, although
Fleming charges less for large amounts.
Investment values are very much things of the future, but investment
trusts generally have a good record. Fleming, quoting figures from
Micropal, says #1000 invested in an average Fleming trust on August 1,
1975, would by the end of July this year have grown to #28,616, compared
with #26,051 for an average investment trust, #18,605 for an average
unit trust, #13,225 for an average UK individual pension, and #4141 if
it had been left in a building society higher rate account.
Savers can select one or more trusts, subject to a minimum of #1000
for a lump sum or #100 a month, or they can leave it to the managers to
make the selection. Currently the managers' choice would be more than
half in UK trusts, mainly Claverhouse, which seeks to track the
All-Share index, and Fleming Mercantile, which concentrates on the
Mid-250 index companies.
There would be an element of overseas involvement, currently through
Fleming Overseas, although this might be switched into other more
closely targeted trusts, China, India or Japan, for instance, as
circumstances suggested.
If investment trust pensions catch on -- and there is a good case for
them -- there could be a significant impact on the trusts' share prices.
As shares going into the pension plan have to be bought in the market,
where there is always a supply if only through deceased estates, the
additional source of buying could have quite an impact on the discounts
which have already been reduced by the success of the savings plans
operated by most management groups.
The degree of risk varies from fund to fund, but if you are both young
and bold, you could put an element of gearing into your pension fund by
using some of the cash to buy warrants. Seven of Fleming's funds
currently have warrants. It is not advertising the warrants idea, but
Chairman Patrick Gifford says: ''They can be included.''

* SINGER Maggie Bell has been in the music business for 25 years and
now lives in Holland with her husband Roland. She is currently touring
Scotland with the Sensational Alex Harvey Band and plays at the King's
Theatre, Glasgow, tomorrow.
MONDAYS to Fridays, I'm up at 6am and Roland and I have croissants and
real Dutch coffee. Elevenses is always a banana and a bowl of bran
because my digestive system needs looking after: all those hot curries
years ago took their toll. I've been round the world four times and
you're done to death food wise. (I'm on HRT too, and you have to look
after yourself).
I drink three litres of French mineral water every single day, and
should really be drinking five litres -- you have to watch out, because
everywhere you go in Holland, you're offered coffee. I drink very little
alcohol now -- I've done all that years ago -- and any wine I take is
mixed with water.
I love to cook and am a very good cook. I'll often make Indonesian
dishes: satay, goreng penang (noodles and veg) or sometiomes zurkool,
the Dutch sauerkraut, or proper paella and I've a great butcher who
gives me all the good cuts.
Sometimes I get the train to the Marks &amp; Spencer in Den Haag to buy
real Scottish salmon or trout. My favourite is still lamb chops with
mint sauce, baked potatoes and a side salad, and I love Haagen Dazs
vanilla ice cream with chocolate topping, but we usually finish every
meal with fruit.
I stock up on my favourite nibbles of dried apricots, Bombay mix, and
cashews from the nut shop at the end of my street.
Fry-ups with sausages, beans, bacon, eggs are absolutely disgusting:
heart attack city. The Scots are wiseing up to that -- and I'm no saint,
I've done it myself. And I've eaten a lot of crap on this visit to
Scotland.
Roland and I don't eat out much but our ideal holiday is Paris --
there, we eat till we drop.

THE Scotch Whisky Association took its campaign for lower excise duty
on spirits to the Tory Party conference in Blackpool and called on party
supporters to back them in their demands by writing to Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke.
Visitors to the association's stand at the conference were encouraged
to fill in a prepared postcard supporting demands for an 8% reduction in
duty this year followed by annual cuts of 4%.
During the three-day conference more than 350 people backed the
campaign, similiar to the support received during a similar campaign at
the recent Labour Party conference in Brighton.
At the moment a bottle of blended whisky selling at #11 carries a tax
burden of #7.41, almost 70% of the retail price, and almost double the
tax of other alcoholic drinks.
But even if their campaign is successful it would take 14 years of
cuts to bring the duty down to the same level of other alcoholic drinks.
Hugh Morison, director-general of the association, said: ''This high
level of cross-party political support is very encouraging in the
build-up to the Budget. The industry hopes the Chancellor will take heed
of this view expressed by his supporters.''

<HEADLINE>Mutual company's life and pensions policyholders could receive average windfall of #800. Norwich Union set for stock market</HEADLINE>

NORWICH Union, one of the largest mutual life offices, is set to
follow the trend set by building societies and convert itself into a
company quoted on the stock market.
This will mean a windfall for its 2.5 million life and pensions
policyholders who have a stake in Norwich Union's life fund and who are
the owners of the business. This includes with-profits endowment
holders. The life fund stands at about #25bn.
In common with those of the Halifax Building Society, members will
have to wait a long time for the benefit to come through. The group said
it would be 1997 ''at the earliest'' before a flotation would occur.
Chief executive Allan Bridgewater commented: ''In view of the amount
of work still to be done it will be well into 1996 before a further
statement can be made.''
Estimates of Norwich Union's worth revolve around #2000m, though it
could be worth considerably more by the time flotation occurs if stock
markets are firm. On present figures, the group's policy holders stand
to receive an average of about #800 each, though how the cake will be
divided will one of the key questions to be decided. The deal will have
to be approved by members.
Norwich Union would be the first life office to give up mutual status,
though a number of companies have been taken over by others and General
Accident is in the throes of acquiring Provident Mutual.
The move is part of a general shake-up in the financial services
industry, where there is a trend away from mutuality towards the
perceived advantages, particularly greater flexibility, of quoted
company status. It is thought that the power to raise risk capital on
stock markets would help mutuals meet increasing competition from the
banks and building societies, many of whom have set up their own life
operations.
It is likely that Norwich Union will seek to raise fresh capital
through offering additional shares in the stock market sale to further
its corporate development.
Mr Bridgewater said his board had been studying the possibility of
demutualisation and had concluded, ''Our preliminary view is that this
course of action would produce significant benefit to members of Norwich
Union Life Insurance Society and assist the overall development of
Norwich Union''.
The Scottish life offices were standing behind mutual status
yesterday, with the biggest, Standard Life, indicating it had more than
enough capital for its development plans.
A spokesman for Scottish Widows said the society had every intention
to remain mutual for some time, though it was ''always ready to consider
all options should circumstances change''.
Norwich Union's decision will mean rich pickings for the City of
London's lawyers and securities houses as preparing the business for
flotation will be a lengthy and complex task. Various regulatory
approvals will also be required. Once the trail has been blazed others
are likely to follow, not least because it will be clear how the City
will value such demutualised companies.
In common with the rest of the industry, Norwich Union has seen a
sharp fall in new UK business this year as a result of the regulatory
crack down, depressed disposable income among consumers and the loss of
its sales link with Leeds Permanent Building Society. The group was
forced to take its entire sales force off the road for several weeks for
retraining and was fined #300,000 for misconduct by its regulator,
Lautro.
The cuts in Norwich Union's bonus rates on short-term with-profits
policies in respect of 1994 were at the top end of the industry's
figures. The group's enthusiasm for the traditional with-profits
endowment policy for repaying mortgages, once the essential
bread-and-butter product, has waned, even to the extent of it advising
that repayment mortgages are better. This must have been a factor in its
decision to abandon its mutual status.
The group is the most diversified of the mutuals, with overseas and
general insurance operations and has made significant inroads into the
healthcare market. Holders of these general policies will not have a
vote on demutualisation and will not share in the windfall.

Lady Claire MacDonald is never in a pickle when it comes to making
preserves
CHUTNEY was an Indian preserve combining fruits or vegetables mixed
with spices and intended to be eaten with cold meats. I love most
aspects of cooking, but I get great pleasure from making jams and
chutneys. It isn't only the sight of rows of pots on my larder
shelves,it is every bit as much the joy of preparing and the smell of
jams and chutneys cooking. Mind you, the smell of cooking chutney is a
real sinus penetrator even when sniffed from the other end of the house
-- it's the simmering vinegar among the other ingredients.
Generally speaking, no bought chutney can rival the home-made stuff.
Having said that, I think that Pettigrew's various types of chutney
(particularly their gooseberry chutney) is almost as good as most
home-made, and much better than some I've tasted.
What disappoints me (and remember, taste is an individual thing) about
certain chutneys are those made with bland fruit, such as plums. Tart
fruit, like gooseberries, are ideal for good chutney, but far and away
the best is Green Tomato Chutney, the recipe which I give you today. It
was given to me (I've made a couple of small alterations to the
original) by Catherine Robertson, who worked with us here at Kinloch for
a great many years till her far too early death eight years ago. We
think of her often, but somehow more than ever at chutney-making time.
One of the few drawbacks about making chutney is that it mustn't be
eaten for several weeks, to let the flavours mature and blend together.
The absolute minimum is three to four weeks, but if you can hold off for
a couple of months the chutney will be much better. For a really good
and very quick sauce simply stir a tablespoon of good chutney into
gently simmering double cream. Let this unlikely sounding mixture simmer
together very gently for a minute and then serve it with grilled chicken
breasts, or with lamb chops -- it really is delicious.
I mentioned earlier that for me a good chutney needs to be made with a
sharp-tasting fruit, and yet the fruit there is often available in
quantity and at a low cost are apples. If you are not careful a most
bland chutney can be an apple and raisin chutney, but if you add a good
quantity of onions, fresh ginger and mustard seed this peps up the taste
of the end result and, for me, transforms apple chutney.
I am happy to see a wide range of chutneys for sale these days not
only in delicatessen shops but in our supermarkets, and this includes
our Co-Op in Broadford where you can even find pickled walnuts, which I
love to put into casseroles of beef, lamb or venison; they enrich the
flavour of a casserole in much the same way as does Balsamic vinegar.
Making chutney is very easy; any work involved lies in the preparation
of the fruit and vegetables, but this is really minimal. But I don't
make chutney in aluminium saucepans -- in fact I don't cook anything
remotely acidic in aluminium these days, although I am not sure whether
or not the research into the possible connection between aluminium and
dementia is proven. To be on the safe side, I use stainless steel pans
instead.
GREEN TOMATO CHUTNEY
3lbs green tomatoes
6 onions
3 large cooking apples
1 pint vinegar
8oz raisins
1lb soft dark brown sugar, or muscovado sugar
1 rounded teaspoon ground ginger
about 3" fresh ginger, skin pared off and the ginger chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
about 1[1/2]-2oz pickling spice
Slice the tomatoes and skin and slice the onions. Put the onions and
tomatoes into a bowl, sprinkle the salt in with them, cover and leave
overnight. Next day drain away the liquid in the bowl. Peel, core and
chop the apples and put them and all the other ingredients into a large
saucepan. Bring the contents to the boil and simmer very gently, pan
uncovered, for two hours. Pot into warmed jars, cover with waxed paper
discs, seal and label when cold. Store in a cool place and don't eat the
chutney for at least four weeks, to let the flavours become mellow. This
slightly dries out with keeping, but give a good stir within each pot
before serving.

SHOPRITE, the discount chain which sold most of its business to Kwik
Save last year, has proposed repaying #15m of preference shares at only
71% of their nominal value.
The financially-troubled company, which now only operates in the Isle
of Man, said there was no way it could meet its existing obligation to
repay the shares in full by the end of this year.
Instead, Shoprite proposed a package of measures which would enable it
to redeem the #1 preference shares at 67p each and pay a final dividend
of 3.94p to give a total payout of 71.94p.
The company, which once owned 100 discount stores in Scotland, said it
could make available #6.5m of cash from the sale of its Scottish and
English business to Kwik Save and the disposal of surplus property.
This would be topped up by #1.3m from an escrow account, which it
hopes to gain access to by the end of November, and #3.5m in new loans
from Lloyds Bank.
Shoprite agreed last year to repay its preference shares early on
December 31, 1995, but it warned in June that this would be difficult.
The board yesterday said there was no way it could meet this
commitment.
Shoprite said the only realistic alternative to its present proposals
was to redeem the preference shares in full in 2009, in accordance with
the terms under which they were originally issued.
''The directors believe that it is extremely unlikely that in the near
to medium term that Shoprite Group will have sufficient funds to redeem
all the preference shares at #1 per share,'' the company warned.
Shoprite poured more gloom on its prospects by announcing a poor set
of results for the six months to July 2.
Pre-tax losses were cut to #395,000 from #687,000, but the group's
turnover on continuing operations fell to #13.9m from #14.3m.
''We expect food retailing in the Isle of Man to remain difficult,''
Shoprite said, warning of increasing competition in the capital Douglas.
The group also owns a Mercedes-Benz dealership in the Isle of Man and
certain investment properties on the island.
Shoprite shares fell [1/2]p to 8p.

THE FTSE-100 Share index yesterday stopped just short of its all-time
high, after bounding ahead for the second consecutive day. Earlier in
the week it had fallen around 50 points, taking its cue from Wall
Street.
This volatility is likely to be a feature of the index given the
various political and economic uncertainties but share movements of the
largest 100 companies, which take in the blue chips, should not be
construed as meaning that the market as a whole is acting similarly.
The enthusiastic ending to the week, for example, has been driven
largely by continuing bid speculation, particularly among the banks, as
well as the influence of the Dow Jones index in New York on a bigger
than expected fall in the US inflation rate. A shortage of stock has
also played a part.
The coming week is just as likely to see another downward technical
adjustment as it is to experience further advances. If the takeover
fever cools and Wall Street suffers a setback, shares could tumble.
The experience of 3i, the leading venture capital investment group,
puts the situation into perspective. The new issue market, which was
overflowing last year is decidedly dampened. After seeing 20 companies
floating in each of the last two years, this year the figure will be
considerably lower although there are still quite a few investment
propositions coming 3i's way.
Ewen Macpherson, the chief executive, points to a general decline in
mergers and acquisitions activity. After the shakeout in the recession,
there are fewer bargains available.
The Footsie is the headline grabber but is not automatically
representative of the market generally though optimism, like gloom,
tends to feed on itself.
Risks ahead
ONE of the main advantages of mutual status for a life company is that
some of the profits made on the life fund do not have to be given to
shareholders as the company is owned by its policyholders.
So while holders of Norwich Union with-profits policies will no doubt
be rubbing their hands at the thought they are going to share in a
building society-type of windfall they should spare a thought for the
future and how plc status will affect their bonuses.
In contrast to the building societies, the windfall will not be
totally risk-free. This does not mean to say they will receive in one
hand and have it taken away by another.
The disadvantage of mutuality is that funds for the development of the
business -- and the rewards of the managers -- have to be taken from
policyholders. This is fine if the development adds value for the life
fund.
But policyholders would be justified to complain if their funds were
used for risk capital to back ventures that might or might not succeed.
In a quoted company, shareholders should bear the risk -- that is what
they buy into the company to provide -- though it has to be said that
this is not always clearly the case in quoted life companies.
The ability to raise risk capital is clearly the biggest attraction
for Norwich Union. The financial services industry is going through a
period of rapid change as the need to drive down costs in a highly
competitive environment becomes imperative.
Once a listed company, Norwich Union can become a predator in an
over-supplied industry, where smaller life offices and building
societies will be easy prey. However, there is a risk of the tables
being turned and Norwich Union emerging as the prey. At a capitalisation
of around #2000m it will be relatively small compared to High Street
monsters like Lloyds Bank and the Halifax.
If the giants of mutuality like Norwich Union and Halifax Building
Society consider quoted company status to be superior then surely the
whole concept is doomed. This would be a pity because a diversity of
business structure is worth having for its own sake and mutuality --
ownership by the business's beneficiaries -- is a more noble form of
organisation, at least in theory.
In practice, mutuals can be every bit as ruthless, not least to their
own employees, as shareholder-driven companies and it would be premature
to write them off.

SCOTCH WHISKY
ALLIED Distillers is launching two new Scotch whisky brands in India,
a year after introducing Teachers Highland Cream to the recently opened
market.
This week it is launching Teacher's Royal Highland, a 12-year-old
premium deluxe whisky, and Old Smuggler, a cheaper value-for-money
blend.
Bill Bergius, the great, great-grandson of William Teacher who first
distilled Teacher's in 1830, is leading a team making presentations of
the new brands in cities such as Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta.
Mr Bergius is Allied Distillers' trade relations director.
Royal Highland and Old Smuggler will broaden the group's product range
in India and lay the foundations for long-term growth in what all whisky
companies see as a potentially lucrative market.
''The future potential for Scotch in India is enormous,'' said David
Bain, the Allied Distillers' regional director responsible for India.
He noted that India's 850 million people drink their way through 57
million cases of locally-produced spirits per year, most of which is
whisky.
But sales of imported whiskies are unlikely to expand spectacularly in
the short term since they are limited by Indian Government quota
restrictions.
Importers may only bring in 30,000 cases of whisky in their first year
of operation, but this quota rises gradually to 75,000 cases after five
years.
''Even if we wanted to sell 100,000 cases a year we are not allowed
to. We are limited to 30,000,'' Mr Bain said.
Importers must also ship all their whisky in bulk and bottle it
locally in conjunction with a local partner. They must also re-export
Indian products to the same value to avoid any net loss of foreign
exchange.
In Allied Distillers' case this means a bottling partnership with
Jagatjit Industries and a scheme to export Indian-made liquors to the
Gulf and other parts of the world with large expatriate Indian
communities.
Scotch whisky exports to India amounted to less than #600,000 last
year, but, despite the grinding poverty of many Indians, the country is
seen as one of the most promising emerging markets.
Mr Bain reckons there are about 100 million Indians earning enough
money to fork out 550 to 900 rupees (#10 to #17) occasionally for a
bottle of Scotch.
The Scotch whisky industry hopes that lobbying in London and Delhi
will soon persuade the Indian Government to ease its present quota
restrictions. None more so than Allied Distillers, which forms part of
the Allied Domecq group. It claims that Teacher's Highland Cream has
become the market leader in India since it was launched there in October
1994.
But this may be partly because Teacher's was only the second Scotch
whisky to be marketed in India after GrandMet's Spey Royal brand, which
was launched a month earlier.
Now there are at least nine locally-bottled Scotch whisky brands on
sale.

Allan Laing discovers that you don't need to be mad to be happy, but
it certainly helps.
HAPPINESS is sipping afternoon tea from a bone China cup in London's
Ritz Hotel. Gosh, it is posh. So posh, in fact, that they cut the crusts
off the cucumber sandwiches.
Across the table sits Angus Deayton, a man who should know about
happiness. He has just spent the best part of two years in search of,
not his own, but other people's happiness. This is not unconnected with
the fact that he has just written a book and made a television series
about it, both cunningly entitled In Search of Happiness.
The pursuit of happiness is something which the Americans have written
into their constitution. According to the wry Deayton, if we British had
a constitution we'd probably adapt it slightly and making the pursuit of
complaining about the weather all the time an ideal.
Deayton is a born cynic. That is what he is good at. As he remarks in
the opening episode of the television series: ''It's easy to be cynical
about Tony Robbins. But just because something is easy, it doesn't mean
it's not worth doing.''
Tony Robbins, the gushing, Pepsident-smiling, excruciatingly handsome,
millionaire American Guru of Positive Thinking is an easy target.
The self-proclaimed boss of the Optimum Performance Technology,
Neurolinguistic, Planning, and Ultimate Success Formulae, you can join
his organisation and change your mind for a mere #529. He is, says
Deayton, the Marks and Spencer of brains. ''If you don't like your brain
then take it to Tony and he'll change it.''
Of course, In Search of Happiness, made for the BBC by Mel Smith and
Griff Jones's company TalkBack, is a glorified (though very amusing)
travelogue. The original idea was to create a travel programme with a
difference, interviewing eccentric people about their concept of
happiness.
Some people, of course, need happiness like they need a hole in the
head. Which brings us neatly round to Oxfordshire couple Joey Mellon and
Amanda Feilding. In the 1960s, as many experimented with mind-altering
drugs, this pair of warmers believed that in order to increase your
vision, you had to increase the volume of blood in your brain.
So, not to put too fine a point on it, they each drilled a hole in
their heads. This, if you want to be scientific about it, is called
trepanation. It is also barking madness and good television.
And then there is the Bolton Wanderer, Marshall Holt. Born and raised
in the Lancashire town, he decided he didn't like it and with the wife
and weans, moved to the Lake District. And then, after a few months, he
decided he wasn't happy there either. So he moved again -- to Australia.
But, after giving it his best shot (six months give or take a day or
two) he moved again -- back to Bolton and a house a couple of hundred
yards from the house he first called home. Now he's happy as a pig in
muck.
What you have to do, says Marshall, is go away and find a new life in
order to discover that you don't have to go away and find a new life.
What makes the series is Deayton's doubts. Glib, smug, sharp as a
tack. Cynical to a glorious fault.
For Deayton, it seems, happiness is taking the mick out of these
wonderfully weird people he encounters on his travels.
''We allowed them to put their case forward so you have to balance
that with the case against. Otherwise it would simply be an
advertisement for them,'' explains Mr Deayton.
Happiness, he says, is a subjective thing. To some it might mean
watching Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras on the centre court at Wimbledon
with a bowl of strawberries in your hand. To others it may mean watching
Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras in the showers with a Polaroid camera in
your hand.
And then there is the man who smokes toad. In Tucson, Arizona, the
Colorado River Toad's great claim to fame is its deadly poison. An
ageing hippy, who goes by the name of White Dog, keeps a colony of these
toads in his back yard. Every day he milks their venom which he then
dries and smokes.
''He claimed that it had no effect on him at all but when I
interviewed him it was noticeable that you could play incidental music
between each word he spoke,'' warned Deayton.
So has the series made Angus Deayton any happier? ''Well, I haven't
drilled a hole in my head,'' he replies. ''I wouldn't say I'm any
happier but I've probably got more idea of how other people make
themselves happier.''
* In Search of Happiness, the TV series, starts on BBC1 on Sunday,
October 15. In Search of Happiness, the coffee table book, is published
by Macmillan (#16.99).

GARDENING
Emerging bulbs foretell the death of winter and Fay Young believes
that such messengers should be accorded much more consideration
SPRING, as far as the bulbs in my garden are concerned, is always a
little late this year. So late that one catalogue is offering incentives
to prevent me forgetting the season altogether. Having failed with the
vacuum cleaner, Bakker Holland now offers a stereo radio if only I will
fill in the order form today.
Failed again. I might be tempted by a nice wide terracotta pot to fill
with their Greigii Red Riding Hood tulips (18 for #4.25) -- or better
still, discounts on the bulbs themselves. But the message here is wrong.
Bakker's bright, sometimes garish, catalogue seems to offer a good range
of popular spring and summer bulbs at reasonable prices (100 mixed
miniature alliums for #3.95).
Why try to drum up custom with inappropriate marketing? Perhaps the
offers irritate because they are reminders that time is slipping by.
Gardening is a pleasure with great potential for guilt -- watching the
red currants ripen and rot on the branch is no worse than buying
daffodil bulbs then leaving them until they send green shoots through
the packaging.
This is not a column for professional or punctual planters. What
follows is far from expert advice, but offers instead the experience of
autumns when work and family beat gardening in the race against time.
Of course, experts say daffodils should be planted in September or
October. ''The earlier the better with the whole narcissus tribe,''
warns the otherwise laid-back Christopher Lloyd in his Well-Tempered
Garden.
But spring bulbs are much more forgiving than soft fruit. In
desperation last November, I grabbed on my weekly supermarket shopping
expedition the last special offer of mixed narcissi for naturalising.
Even then the bulbs waited until the week before Christmas when,
following a tip from a magazine to create the ''natural look'', I threw
the bulbs as far as I could across the grass and dug them in where they
fell, although it was so cold that the trowel almost stuck to my hand.
Miraculously, a mixture of yellow Lent Lillies (pseudo narcissus) and
white Pheasant's Eye (poeticus recurvus) flowered in April and May. Now
I expect to see them spread through the patch of waste land we are
reclaiming as, according to Christopher Lloyd, they would have been
making new roots by the end of June.
Last year I decided not to bother with Christmas, or even New Year,
hyacinths and spent the money on white multiflora hyacinths and crammed
them in late October into a 10-inch dark blue glazed pot on special
offer at B &amp; Q. I used multi-media compost (because it was there)
instead of bulb fibre and left them under a black bin bag in a cold, dry
place until the green shoots appeared.
The small room we call our conservatory is very cold, and not always
dry, in winter so I almost forgot they were there until towards the end
of January when I opened the door to find the pot full of white spiked
flowers and scent in the air strong enough to overpower the store of
onions and anything the cats had left behind.
However, there are merits in planning ahead. This year I aim to take
the advice of Christine Skelmersdale, owner of the specialist bulb
nursery, Broadleigh Gardens.* In her book, Bulbs , Christine (''Lady''
to her catalogue customers) Skelmersdale suggests we should
revolutionise the way we buy bulbs.
''The usual approach is to buy some bulbs and then wonder where to put
them. I want to reverse this process and consider the garden first and
then choose the bulbs that will enhance that uninspiring border or add a
spot of interest to a drab lawn in February.''
With that in mind I am looking for Pink Pearl bedding hyacinths to
join the dwindling forces of Christmas hyacinths past in brightening the
corner between the bay bush and the pink and white ''Bleeding Hearts''
of dicentra spectabilis. I fancy a line of purple Allium Aflatunense to
line a new grassy path, perhaps mixed with variegated hostas or catmint,
and a spread of clear blue muscari in front of the pale green flowers of
hellebore corsicus.
I need more tulips. As specialist firms tend to run out of stocks
early, I am too late to order from catalogues. However, shops are still
displaying a good variety of both species and hybrid tulips. To cheer up
the corner by the back door, the two-year-old pot of Red Riding Hood --
which have been growing through a clump of hostas -- now needs to be
replenished, although it is almost worth keeping the dwindling bulbs for
the beautiful red-veined leaves alone.
. Tulips can be used for all kinds of effects, from the wild-looking,
multi-headed white Turkestanica with orange-yellow centres to the
wonderfully over-the-top frilly Black Parrot. What's more, they
positively prefer being planted late. ''Whatever you do,'' advises
Christine Skelmersdale, ''do not plant the bulbs until October at the
earliest.''  November will do. Broadleigh also produce an early spring
catalogue, including snowdrops, cyclamen, and hellebores, available from
January.

RACHMANINOV'S three Symphonic Dances, largely unsung, underplayed, and
undervalued, comprise a near-masterpiece. Go and hear them tonight at
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, even though, in their first outing this week
at the opening of the Perth series on Thursday, they were delivered by
conductor Mark Elder at rather less than full pelt.
The dances seemed at times straitjacketed; it was almost as though
Elder had the music on a leash, not allowing it to boil convulsively,
restraining its bite and drive. Massive rhythmic tension (and thwacking
release) should characterise the dances. They were a bit staid and
four-square. Even the middle dance, which should have a smoky, curling
quality, was rather laboured.
Where Elder did score was in his engaging and witty introductions to
two little-known works in the first half: Dvorak's Golden Spinning
Wheel, a bitty and episodic symphonic poem that contains some ravishing
music, and Janacek's Fiddler's Child, which ranges from austerity to
typically scorching string writing.
Mark Kaplan was soloist in an attractive and well-characterised, if
rather restrained, account of Prokofiev's glittering First Violin
Concerto that concluded a very long first half. I'll qualify that
criticism by pointing to the wonderfully grating, rasping playing he
produced in the second movement. Like the Rachmaninov that followed,
however, at crucial moments it seemed short on rhythmic tension.

MY LAST GOOD MEAL
Andrew Radford, Head Chef and owner of the Atrium
* WITHOUT wishing to sound like a jetsetter, the most memorable food
occasion was the last night of a family holiday -- myself, my wife and
our three children -- in July. We were right on the square in Siena and
had dinner in a restaurant called El Campo I think with the sun setting
and the children running round the square. It was very simple food but
wonderful.
We had Tuscan bruschetta among a multitude of grilled bits and pieces.
I had the sardines then grilled fish as a main course. We were staying
well and truly in the heart of Chianti country so it was a bottle of
Chianti Classico on the table. I really believe that a meal can be good
anywhere -- even McDonald's if the burgers are hot!

BEST CELLARS
Conrad Wilson embarks on a drinking tour of Italy and samples some of
the smackers and some shockers
TO DRINK your way from Sicily to the Alps is to be reminded not only
of the diversity of Italian wine but of the vicissitudes of the weather
that helps to produce it. Sunshine, of the Australian or Californian
sort, is one of the great Italian myths. Once you have experienced
September winds and fog in Taormina, thunder and lightning between
Naples and Rome, and lashing rain in Umbria, you realise why Italian
wines vary from region to region and from year to year.
Which, of course, is part of their fascination. Who wants everything
to taste consistently like a New World Chardonnay? At house-wine level,
Italy -- like France -- provides alternating shocks and excitements.
Each bottle or carafe is a shot in the dark, from the appalling
oxidisation of what could have been a bright, thirst-quenching Sicilian
white -- attractively (or ominously) labelled Monte Etna -- at a price
and in a restaurant where it would have seemed rude to send the bottle
back -- to the clean precision of an unpromising Colli Romani at less
than #8 a litre. The latter, sampled at quite a touristic restaurant on
a sunny square in Trastevere, was a model of what Rome's much-abused
white wine should be. Vino ordinario of the most gulpable sort, it
showed no hint of having passed its sell-by date.
In Sicily there was Corvo to remind you that there is more to this
popular name than the familiar green bottles that are increasingly
expensive mainstays of Scottish trattorias. True, even in Taormina, you
have to pay for the quality of one of the classier Corvos, but #8 for a
bottle of excellent Corvo Colombo Platino in a good Taormina restaurant
is little more than the over-the-counter price for the same wine at
Valvona and Crolla in Edinburgh.
The fact that Valvona stocks it at all -- at what, by British
standards, is a very fair price -- nevertheless speaks for itself. Of
all the good wines I tasted during a three-week tour, most are available
in one form or another in Scotland's leading Italian wine shop.
Although one deliciously dry Sicilian white, with the enticingly
musical name of Donnafugata, seems to be missing from this compendious
Edinburgh list. Produced by the Contessa Entellina Gabriella Anca Rallo
-- a name more famously associated with Marsala -- it is the jewel in
many a Taormina restaurant's crown, yet costs no more than what in
Scotland you would pay for a basic bottle of Settesolle.
The same could be said for the subtle white Falerno Villa Matilde that
considerably perked up an otherwise indifferent seafood dinner in
Naples's longest-established waterfront restaurant, yet added very
little to the cost of what was, in any case, a by no means expensive
meal. Valvona sells it for #8.89, though even at that inevitably steeper
price it is a wine well worth experiencing.
Further north, in Umbria, the wines of Giorgio Lungarotti likewise
wear their pedigree lightly. True, you might have to pay as much as #12
in a four-star hotel in Todi for a red San Giorgio with a bit of bottle
age, but again, by British standards, such prices are a snip. In French
restaurants today, reds of this quality can be prohibitively expensive,
but in Italy the good exchange rate, and the pride that seems to be
genuinely taken in selling good wine at a accessible prices, work in the
visitor's favour.
There are Chiantis -- not in wicker bottles -- to prove that the name
is to be treated seriously when it carries the seal of a good producer.
And north of Milan there are fresh Pinot Grigios to try, one of which, a
fine product of the house of Bidoli, has already reached Oddbins at the
knockdown price of #3.99.
Far from being just another anonymous North Italian white, this one
has real personality and a luscious fruitiness, strongly recommended.

WHAT can one say about Peter Cunnah, founder and front for the dance
sensation D:Ream? Well, he appears to be a shiny, happy man with a
penchant for outstandingly loud suits that embody the totality of chaos
theory thus far. Beautiful.
Terrible disappointment, then, that he chose last night to sport a
particularly drab black ensemble.
Not that the pre- and teeny-couch clubbers who formed the vast
majority of the crowd cared. The violet and white lights that heralded
the coming of The Great One was their cue to scream and scream and
scream.
And how the lad played to their fantasies. There he was, bending to
touch a hand here, blow a raspberry there. Didn't the crowd just love
him for it. A veritable avalanche of school-dinner passes rained down
upon him. Top of the Pops was never like this.
Shame the music's so dire.
D:Ream are at the forefront of a new musical genre. They combine forms
of stadium pop with dance; the former at its most inane, the latter at
its most tame. At its best, a repetition of upbeat chants, the sound is
very successful commercially. Witness, Things Can Only Get Better. At
its worst, a repetition of upbeat chants, the sound is risible. Witness,
Shoot Me With Your Love. Somewhere in the middle, with such as Party Up
The World, they lurch into Black Lace tribute mode.
To top it all, the overall sound was disappointingly thin. D:Ream:
best experienced vicariously.

TOM Jones -- icon of macho sexuality -- is pumping hot suggestions
through the pub speakers. The lads, sharp in suits and ties, are
thrusting pelvises against unprotesting empty air, in time to Tom's
throbbing rhythms.
Pint in hand -- never spilling a drop, mind, -- they are setting out
the parameters of being a bloke. Rules like -- you can grab, but you
cannot stroke. You can punch, slap, grip and even crunch someone's
crotch, there's a masculine edge of aggro in that, even when it's
supposedly a joke. But you cannot show a smidgeon of physical tenderness
-- that's nancy stuff and well out of order.
All of this rigour and rutual is caught, with great accuracy and
perception, by choreographer Lloyd Newson and the eight male dancers of
DV8 in Enter Achilles, a blisteringly funny and unsettling study of
everyday maleness. Like some cluster of over-grown Peter Pans, the lads
are observed swaggering and crowing in their favourite environment: the
pub. Here they can cocoon themselves in a booze-soaked camaraderie that
forever threatens to splinter into all-out ruck and mayhem.
It takes only a bright shirt, a drooping wrist, a dance step that is a
tad too graceful for the pack to turn hostile, for the banter to give
way to blows.
To begin with, there's a marvellous, ridiculous fantasy element that
Newson uses to point up the block-headed attitudes at work -- the wimp
in the bright shirt, for instance, metamorphosis into a (somewhat inept)
Superman, as every boy longs to do. But when one bloke's secret is
discovered -- he harbours an inflatable doll -- the piece explodes with
a lacerating viciousness that chills because, like so much else, it is
both recognisable and believable. This is a work that has researched and
observed actual behaviour, then heightened it into dance that is at once
an extension of walking, talking, being, and yet is electric with
precisely judged risk and physicality.
It's a work that takes the breath away at the time, but the real
shockwaves come later when you start to recall just how bleak and devoid
of emotional shadings this pub never, never land and its inmates are.
Repeated tonight -- not to be missed if possible.

IT'S probably fair to say that, by their own standards, the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra will assess last night's performance of Mozart's
opera, The Escape from the Harem, as containing -- at best -- potential.
It was a mixture of the splendid and the frankly mundane, of the
exemplary and the under-prepared.
Over recent years, we have become used to stupendously polished
versions of Mozart's operas staged by the same outfit and conductor at
the Edinburgh Festival. The same lavish rehearsal time was evidently not
available this time to Sir Charles Mackerras, conducting the opera for
his own seventieth birthday concert.
Little telling points in the playing -- wee glitches and awkward gear
changes -- were the giveaway, though much of it, crisp and crackling,
was what we would have expected. But it was in front of the orchestra
(and behind, with a virtually inaudible SCO Chorus) where it fell down.
Anthony Rolfe Johnson is one of the finest tenors around. But last
night (as Belmonte), alone among the cast, he carried the score of the
opera all evening; a score, moreover, in which his head was constantly
buried for dialogue and song alike. Any characterisation thus went by
the wayside, apart from which it was a downright distraction.
Uncomfortable in a different way was Rosa Mannion's Constanze, lacking
any cream in her tone and, above a certain point, glaringly harsh and
bright, with a lethal rasp in her top notes.
The rest -- Stafford Dean's wonderful Osmin, Peter Bronder's lyrical
Pedrillo, and Lillian Watson's dazzlingly entertaining Blonde -- were
brilliant, knowing their parts, and their characters, and really going
for it.

Music
TOMMY SMITH'S latest group has been specially designed to get the
tenor saxophonist more established in Europe. Smith has worked with
multi-international line-ups before but the musicians who join him in
Azure are among the very best European jazz has to offer and on this
showing could very well provide that passport.
Anglo-Canadian trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, Swedish bassist Lars
Danielsson and Norwegian drummer Jon Christensen all have major musical
personalities, and Smith's new compositions allowed plenty of space for
them to make their contributions.
Dedicated to the Spanish artist Miro, these ''sound pictures''
employed a light touch, with Smith and Wheeler shadowing each other like
wary boxers before hitting often terse, tightly arranged unison
passages. Meanwhile, Christensen and Danielsson would be proving
themselves the very boys for creating relaxed momentum.
On first exposure the soloing was perhaps more memorable than the
tunes. Wheeler, with his pungent trumpet playing and rich, plummy
flugelhorn tone, brings an instant authority, and Smith, particularly on
soprano, responded with some equally strong, melodic playing from the
heart as much as the head.
What came across most strongly, however, was the sense of
communication on stage and the point that at this level music is not
just about playing the right notes.
The rhythm team both create great sounds, Danielsson purring along
gorgeously even on the toughest of riffs, and Christensen aware of the
precise point on his kit to strike for the required effect. They'll be
doing it all over again at the RSAMD in Glasgow tonight; if I were you,
I'd try to catch them.

CHECK out these sharp little numbers for the new season. Black meets
white in a plethora of plaid and birdseye or houndstooth checks. And the
smart girl about town has a great new uniform.
Black and white checks were once the staple diet of leisured ladies
who did little more than lunch. Cut into improbable proportions by the
post-war masters of Parisian couture -- Christian Dior, Jacques Fath,
and Balenciaga -- houndstooth became a visual shorthand for daytime
elegance. Much more recently, Britain's prodigiously talented John
Galliano used just such a black and white check scaled down to
puppytooth proportions for his much photographed (and highly
influential) neo-couture revival last spring.
But unlike those forties originals and nineties revivals of padded and
body re-constructing tailoring, this autumn's check tailoring is
practically perfect for women who work. The key shapes are clean and
lean -- pencil skirts, the new dead simple no-sleeve dress, and a jacket
cut close to the body for fit without fuss. And for women whose
authority or competence need not be articulated in a suit, this season's
check story extends into great knitwear and charming accessories too.
Wear either one check element with lots of black, or lots of check with
one element of black. For a colour accent, try red.
There is still something irrepressibly chic about a city suit checked
in black and white. It's less mannish than pinstripe and a whole lot
less severe than solid black. Maybe just that hint of swagger? A
suggestion, perhaps, that the woman who wears it is really going places?
Black and white checked tailoring can bridge that sartorial credibility
gap between simply looking good and being taken seriously. In
professional terms, it is an achiever. On the great chessboard of office
politics, getting into check could be your most effective move this
season.
And here you have it -- an almost infinite variety. All set out in
black and white.

THE Tories are currently taking an interest in the short sharp shock
treatment for young offenders currently operating in America's ''boot
camps''. In Putting the Boot in (R4) Martin McNeely, a 25-year-old
politics student from the University of Ulster, reported from the
Southampton Intensive Treatment Centre in South Virginia, where a harsh
militaristic regime is meted out to probates who have to be aged under
24 and judged to be mentally stable.
Some cannot stay the course and return to serve the prison sentences
which are the only alternative, but many offenders spoke with glowing
enthusiasm of the benefits incurred by this drastic change in their
lives. Those not turfed out get to graduate as a ''platoon''.
Thank-you letters from graduates were quoted (''I miss the place'')
and there were even parents who had written to the unit wishing to enrol
their sons before they had actually committed a crime as a kind of
pre-emptive strike against them winding up in jail.
The probates, mostly there because off drug abuse and reckless crime,
largely come from urban areas and dysfunctional backgrounds and their
experience at the centre is often their first taste of a lifestyle
involving any structure or consistency.
Stubbly young men, into hanging round the streets, drinking, and doing
deals, are drilled, deafened with orders, and hair-cropped; the push-up,
sit-up, and blistered foot replaces the shoot-up, the booze and a
dead-end existence.
But as one probation officer admitted, the weakest part of the
programme was that there was no strong component of after-care, and
after their harsh interlude of playing soldiers and labouring
intensively, the young men returned to the same environment.
This is the stage of the rehabilitating game the Tories too are
dismally poor at addressing, as we know from their disastrous Care in
the Community (not) programme. Re-offending rates have not budged, so
ultimately, after all that drilling in the square, it's back to square
one.
A generally more pleasant but equally radical change in people's lives
happens when they begin a university degree. As the rector of Glasgow
University, Johnny Ball, said this year to assembled freshers (Radio
Scotland): ''This is the last time you will look as if you were dressed
by your mothers.''
The four programmes provided an entertaining and telling overview of
new-student experience. A concerned mother phones her daughter to ask if
she has forgotten to pack anything. On getting the answer, the Mamma's
tone shifts from happy-chatty to strained niggle -- ''What do you want a
bottle opener for?''
The first programme in a new series called Who Sings the Hero (R4),
celebrating, as the publicity blurb put it, ''acts of heroism by
ordinary people that are too easily forgotten'', was eminently
forgettable. Dealing with a true story, The Sinking of the City of
Cairo, dramatised the horrible consequences of a ship being torpedoed by
a German U-boat off the South African coast in 1942.
The only remaining survivor of the sinking, Douglas Quantrill,
provided the meat of historical truth, but the dramatiser proceeded to
make banal mince of it. The actress playing a Sloaney war widow had to
wade through lines like: ''Hardly had time to know him, poor chap.''
Alan Drury's adaptation of Sheridan Le Fanu's Gothic horror story,
Uncle Silas (R4), on the other hand, was a veritable feast, its fictive
verity blessed with an extraordinarily fine cast including Dorothy Tutin
(deliciously wicked), Joan Sims (wicked with goodness), Kathleen Byron
(sweet heroine without saccharine), and Graham Crowden (all ageing
misguided integrity).
I look forward to George Cole's utter villainy as the scheming
laudanum-junkie Silas, and to Joan Littlewood playing the landlady of a
dubious London hotel. Bet she'll get her teeth into that one . . .

DUNCAN Ferguson lashed out this week, not for the first time. Now an
exile from the park he dubbed ''Jurassic'', he remains implacable in his
attitude.
The former director of An Communn Gaidhealach (for it is this Duncan
Ferguson to whom I refer) believes that those who run the Mod are fit
for the dinosaur age. I have no comment to offer on his views, as I have
as much knowledge of the Mod as I have of rock concerts, but it struck
me as an interesting illustration of something I have felt for a long
time about my Gaelic cousins. It is a mixture of admiration,
exasperation, and non-comprehension.
There can be few peoples on earth who have contributed as much to the
world in proportion to their numbers as the Gaels. Perhaps the Jews --
and it is not for nothing that the Gaels have been sometimes identified
with the Lost Tribe of Israel.
Across the globe you will find them in positions of merit. In our own
country they are distinguished in the spheres of medicine, law, the
printed word, the church, and especially education. For every one of
these categories I can think of men and women of distinction whose
contribution is immense. (Lunchtime television yesterday showed us one
such in Murdo Ewan Macdonald.) Far from being dinosaurs, they are often
in the forefront of radical and humanitarian projects.
Now for the exasperation bit. Why is it then, that so many projects
which seem designed to improve the lot of Gaels are so viciously
despised by those they are designed to help? The lament of so many that
the Isle of Skye was losing out by its isolation is coupled with
resistance to anything which disturbs the status quo, especially if it
is the work of incomers or outsiders. The Skye Bridge is a perfect
illustration of this.
The cracks which appeared this week in its concrete facade have been
seized upon with glee by those who want it to fail.
It took me back to the chorus of moans which greeted the introduction
of the new Ullapool-Stornaway ferry in the early seventies. It was with
wry amusement that I listened to nostalgic praise of its merits when it
was withdrawn from service this year. Perhaps if someone writes a
Mod-winning song about the Skye Bridge in a generation's time, it too
will come to be as well loved as the other bridges of Scotland.
No-one is suggesting a bridge to Harris but various initiatives have
been tried in this beautiful isle which have attracted similar
hostility. The Leverhulme project (which bequeathed the village of
Leverburgh) was one such and the current wrangle over the super-quarry
is another. No doubt both of these schemes have their downside, but my
point is that those who are most vociferous against such schemes are
usually those who were most outspoken about the needs which they
address, but seldom have an alternative to offer themselves.
Of course this is not a phenomenon confined to the Gaidhealtachd, and
I have noticed it in community politics in Glasgow. My use of it is to
establish that it is strong in the north-west highlands and islands and
runs through all aspects of life. Especially religion. Nowhere does the
schizoid tendency come to the fore than in the religion of the Western
Isles.
Mostly I take the view that it is the business of the churches there
what they want to take literally in the Bible and what they want to
ignore (for nobody is really a literal literalist otherwise they would
be burning witches and drowning child molesters with millstones). Of
course there are some churches which go further than others in the zeal
for literalism such as the Free Presbyterian ban on women cutting or
styling their hair (derived from a heady cocktail of 1st Corinthians
chapter 11 and 1st Peter chapter 3).
However, I was moved by Aonghas Macneacail's letter in yesterday's
Herald about the funeral of his mother, a Free Church adherent. I wish
that the callous choice of passages emphasising the sin and subjection
of women, and the pastorally cruel failure to mention the name of the
deceased, far less commend her, were an isolated instance. Alas they are
not. I have heard many stories about weddings and funerals involving
clergymen of the Free Church, Free Presbyterian and even Church of
Scotland in which such an arrogant (and pastorally indefensible)
attitude were displayed. ''Like burying a dog'', one kirk elder remarked
to me after attending a Free Kirk burial.
However, the ''satanic vestries'' are not all on the Protestant side.
I have been at a requiem mass at which a mere nod was made to the name
of the deceased to whom we had come to pay our respects. I have a
Catholic friend who was told by a priest that marrying a non-Catholic (a
term which makes no distinction between militant atheists, the lapsed
and practising Presbyterians) was akin to marrying a negro.
The fact is that the flaws of the Gaels are the sins of Scotland as a
whole. We are prodigious (as Bill Fletcher's new book of Famous Scots
who changed the world makes very clear). But we are also exasperating in
our capacity to criticise schemes which help us evolve as a nation.
The conclusion I am forced to come to is that the Gaels are no more
(or less) sinful or schizophrenic than the rest of Scotland. It is
simply that they are more distinctive when they moan. Come to think of
it, that's what the Mod sounds like to many of us. However, I can't
blame others for sometimes thinking that the churches are like Jurassic
Park.

Anna Burnside finds authentic Native American craftwork close to home
and learns of its powers.
THE dark-skinned, almond-eyed girl stares down at drivers from
billboards and bus shelters everywhere. Disney's Pocahontas, the
all-powerful empire's version of the Powhatan Indian girl who saved an
English soldier's life, is the hot ticket for the half term.
Where Disney leads, spin-off rucksacks, bedspreads, and unnecessary
plastic objects are sure to follow. Pester power will ensure that the
memorable face of the girl whose name means Little Mischief will be
everywhere in the run-up to Christmas.
Thanks to an Edinburgh businesswoman, however, there is an
alternative. Fiona Pringle is Britain's biggest importer of American
Indian artefacts, supplying her own shop and others with jewellery,
fetishes, peace pipes, sand pictures, medicine wheels, and other
hand-made artefacts. The real Pocahontas, who was from Virginia, might
not recognise the style of the New Mexican craftwork on Pringle's
shelves, but there is a huge demand for these genuine Native American
items.
Pringle opened her upmarket gift shop, Wrap, in Edinburgh's West End
in 1981. After her first successful Christmas, on holiday in the States,
she was sniffing out the competition in a craft shop in Washington.
Dinky animals carved from semi-precious stones caused a blip in her
stock-sourcing radar system. ''They were tiny fetishes, little table-top
talismans. I thought these are so cute, the carving is nice, they would
be easy to ship . . . so next thing I knew I was on a plane out to the
south-west to get some,'' she says.
First stop was the Zuni reservation where she bought $500-worth of
fetishes. Driving on through Gallup, the town at the intersection of
Zuni, Hopi and Navaho territories, she could hardly keep her eyes on the
road. There was turquoise jewellery everywhere. Pringle walked into a
trading post and when the guy offered her everything at quarter price
her already-low resistance was wiped out. Two thousand dollars down, she
had bought the lot.
Pringle was acting on her hunch that this stuff would sell. ''By March
we had sold everything.''
When other shop owners started asking Pringle for stock she moved the
business onto a wholesale footing. That took a tough year of
negotiating, haggling, and establishing a reputation for taking no
nonsense. Doing business with Little Beaver and Johnny Eagletail is
quite different from ordering two gross of gypsy hoops from the cash and
carry.
''It's very ad hoc, an enlarged cottage industry. The Navahos come
into town, buy the fittings and the raw silver, then work from home.
When they need money, or once a week, or sometimes once every six months
they'll come into the town and sell it either via the trading posts or
on the streets, depending on how desperate they are. It's not like a
sweatshop industry, I don't order people to make so many earrings, they
make up their mind and their own market,'' Pringle says.
She is committed to fair trade principles and is happy to plough cash
into the reservation economy. Pringle is drawn to the spiritualism and
legends surrounding the Indian artefacts she sells, but she has no
illusions about the people she's dealing with. ''Sometimes I sit in my
motel room thinking 'What the hell am I doing this for?' I know I
probably am helping but it's still terribly depressing and you wonder
what your tiny little contribution is. I might be the biggest wholesaler
in Britain and I do a lot of business out there but it's peanuts
compared to the deprivation they live in.''
Pocahontas won't, she believes, bring new converts rushing to her shop
-- although she would be delighted if the film featured a dream catcher
or a medicine shield. The peace pipes, war clubs, and fetishes in Wrap,
many of which are signed and come with a tag of authenticity, are not
gimmicky souvenirs but powerful traditional articles.
Tiny skulls, bits of bone or antler, fur and feathers feature in the
craft work; the fetish carvings, of bears, wolves, eagles, and badgers
are primitive and chunky, not doe-eyed and friendly.
Everything has a meaning and a purpose. Hunters would take a fetish of
an animal which preyed on the animal they hoped to catch to help speed
their arrows. They might wear a turquoise cuff to protect their
vulnerable wrists during the hunt. A child who could not sleep will be
given a dream catcher, to trap the nightmares that are disturbing his
rest.
Pringle believes that the power of the Indian craftspeople survives
the long journey and her customers testify to the positive effects of
their fetishes and medicine wheels.
Pringle's next problem is a flood of fakes. The silversmithing
sweatshops of Thailand, Korea and Hong Kong are churning out identical
copies of inlaid, beaded and carved earrings, rings and necklaces. ''So
far it hasn't affected my business at all,'' says Pringle. ''I deal with
people who want the real thing with all the power of the Native American
spiritualism. But even over there you have to be really careful when
you're buying, you can get stitched up by people who pick up cheap
Filipino necklaces.''

TOMORROW millions of Iraqis will have a chance to vote for their
existing President, Saddam Hussein, in a referendum covering the whole
country, except the three northern provinces dominated by the Kurds and
protected by the United Nations. There is no other candidate, but
participants will be presented with the opportunity to record a ''No''
vote since a space is provided for that on the ballot paper. It would
take enormous courage to vote ''No'' since people cannot be sure that
their decision will prove to be secret; it would even require
considerable courage to abstain. No-one should be surprised, therefore,
if the figures, when they are made available next Monday, show a
gigantic turnout and a very heavy endorsement of the President. The
surprise would be anything else from what is a cynical device intended
to confer a degree of democratic legitimacy on a regime when came to
power by force and retains it by terror. Since the regime has
comprehensively failed in every policy it has adopted these past 10
years, it cannot be popular -- but the referendum will be held to show
that it is, and that the continuing UN sanctions are no longer
necessary.
In fact a good case on humanitarian grounds could be advanced to end
the sanctions, in that their victims are the mass of Iraqis who are
powerless to affect Saddam's regime one way or another. That mass might
just boil up and cauterise him and his heavily armed elite, but it
remains unlikely given the immense power at his disposal, as well as the
willingess to use it. The recent defections of highly placed
individuals, including two of his own sons-in-law, are eloquent as to
the extent of discontent even at the top of Iraqi society, but they also
suggest that any organised uprising would be immensely difficult to
bring about. One of the defectors has insisted that a potential rising
is merely awaiting a signal, but that seems like whistling in the wind.
The referendum would not affect the possibility of a rising one way or
another, but the regime would hope that, as well as confering a spurious
legitimacy, an overwhelming ''Yes'' vote might encourage the Americans
to deal directly with Baghdad, accept the suspension of the UN
sanctions, and free oil exports.
Few Middle Eastern governments are as unappealing as Saddam Hussein's
but the required leap from unpopularity to revolution is enormous. Iraq
is a particularly savage police state with little surviving vestige of
the rule of law. There is no countervailing force to the Army and
although its loyalty to Saddam must now be seriously questioned, the key
units, the heavily armed Republican Guard, remain in line. Any cracks in
their allegiance would be disastrous for Saddam's survival; but every
effort is made to protect such forces, their police and administrative
equivalents, from any exposure to the consequences of sanctions. Unless
and until they begin to suffer Saddam will survive, though any sign of
his weakening would invite an immediate response. Possibly the most
likely peaceful end to his power would be his own deliberate exile. That
is all a matter of speculation. What is not is that anyone will take a
''Yes'' vote seriously either in the West or in the Middle East itself.

ANN DONALD talks with playwright Eleanor Moira Keady on how she
overcame a horrific life of abuse and unravelled her body's multiple
personalities to find her true self.
AS SHE fast approaches 50, Eleanor Moira Keady has lived a life that
would induce a salivating excitement in any crass American TV executive
who, wise to the public's helpless fascination with certain taboo
subjects, would turn this woman's horrific yet compelling life story
into a top-rating TV mini-series.
A Glaswegian poet and playwright who was born in a male body and
christened Michael in 1945, Keady spent most of her childhood in
hospital battling various ailments which continue to dog her to this
day. Family life was hell -- a catalogue of physical and psychological
abuse. By the age of six she is thought to have developed a condition
called multiple personality, which culminated in her eventual
acknowledgement of 10 different personas.
As a male she married and had three children, all of whom she is still
very close to. In 1979 Keady had a sex-change operation from male to
female, though this is a contentious issue and has sparked off a
complicated legal wrangle that is still in the hands of lawyers and
therefore cannot be publicly discussed.
In 1984, by her own definition, she went insane. This state she
believes is quite separate from having a multiple personality. In 1987
due partly, she believes to ECT treatment and a near-death experience,
she recovered her sanity and her Self. Since then, Eleanor Moira Keady
has, as she vividly states, ''been exploring and discovering the
collective ME''.
As part of this recognition and subsequent exploration of herself,
Keady has written two short plays which will be premiered this Saturday
as part of The Tron Theatre's New Writing Showcases. Directed by Michael
Boyd and starring the writer herself, Stuart McQuarrie and Fiona Bell,
the company will present what promises to be an explosive reading of The
Room and Fragementalisation.
Sitting in a secluded corner of The Tron bar, where in fact she does
most of her writing, the vocal and strong personality of Keady is
reflecting upon the importance of her work as a therapeutic tool. ''I
originally wrote both these pieces as a means of explaining what
happened to me when I went into the relaxation classes at the
psychiatric day centre in Sheffield,'' she says of the pivotal
experience in 1981 that after 35 years of psychiatrist's confusion led
finally to her being diagnosed as multiple personality.
As she recalls that time in the relaxation classes: ''I was constantly
'getting lost'. It took hours for me to return to consciousness. I was
unable verbally to explain what happened to me . . . I went into a
catatonic state. So I wrote it down.''
Both The Room and Fragmentalisation reveal what was happening in the
maelstrom of Keady's mind while in this outwardly catatonic state. Here
was where the multiple selves revealed themselves, had conversations
with each other, where the concept of time and the presence of a mirror
induced absolute terror.
She describes this dual fear thus: ''In being a multiple personality
one has problems with time! -- You lose it! You misplace it! It eludes
one! It escapes one! It terrifies one! One has a constant and on-going
passion to know the time.''
As for her horror of reflective surfaces, this was, she whispers in an
emotional voice, because there was never one constant face reflected
back. ''I couldn't look at a mirror until about three years ago because
I would see a different face,'' she says. ''I couldn't shave, put on
make up or wash because it would be like me putting makeup or whatever
on YOUR face.''
The multiple selves or ''we'' as Keady refers to them with a smile,
before checking herself and immediately replacing that pronoun with
''I'' and a vigorous breast-beating motion to underline the correction,
first emerged when she was as young as six years old. This is according
to her former psychiatrist in Sheffield, Paul Hunt, who back in the
early eighties diagnosed Keady as multiple personality and set about
unravelling what he noted as 15 personalities and Keady recognises as
10.
Here she reels off the litany of personas, counting each one off on
her fingers. ''There was 'I' Michelle one, 'I' Michael two, 'I' Michael
three, 'I' Pamela . . . and other minor personas. I have to prefix the
name with 'I' because I just can't say the name. They were, are,'' she
hastily qualifies with great stress being placed on each pronoun,
''still part of this collective me though they are no longer individual
I's but I've assimilated them as different aspects of me.''
Sitting in the quiet cafe, Keady can speak with cool clarity and
obvious perception about these former ''I's'', though strong emotion
tends to break through when she is understandably adamant about
asserting the pain that she encountered in her formative years.
''The different ''I's'' accumulated over the years with each
successive inability to acknowledge whatever it was that was coming at
me,'' she explains. ''It was like putting up a series of walls one in
front of the other.''
Michael/Michelle or Michelle/Michael is how Keady refers to the female
self that her psychiatrist, Paul Hunt believes emerged at the age of
six. This second personality was, she has since learnt from Hunt, a
barrier the young mind threw up to protect the other from the physical
pain caused by years of illness, operations and ''pain, fear, horror and
terror'' as Keady recalls her family life.
At the age of 12, Wendy was created. ''Of course it didn't physically
happen,'' smiles Keady, ''but in my minds-eye Michael and Michelle made
a baby. I went into the bathroom when I knew the baby was going to come
and I bore Wendy. She had to grow up very quickly because
(Michael/Michelle) needed protection because my mother's marriage was
falling apart and we needed someone else to step in and receive the
blows and the rapes.
''Then some years pass and Michael two is around at this point,
because Michael one died in Berwick,'' she pauses and adds with a shrug
and a laugh -- ''It may sound uncomplicated saying Michael one, two,
three but you don't know any other names at a young age.''
In her late teenage years Pamela emerged. ''Ahh, Pamela,'' Keady nods.
''Pamela was the concillatory one, the spiritual one who would say
'C'mon lets all calm down'.''
The moment of reckoning and recovery for Keady came in 1987 when, due
to a serious heart defect, she found herself at death's door. ''I
remember lying on the hospital bed while all around the doctors were
saying 'we're losing her' and I thought that I was going to die other
than by my own hand,'' she says, before mentioning matter-of-factly the
suicide attempts during the seventies and eighties.
''I resolved then,'' she continues, ''that if I was going to die, then
I was going to die as ME. It was as simple as that.'' And she bangs the
table in emphasis of this crucial turning point in her life.
Since then Keady's life has been a deep and personal reconnaissance
mission into the composite, but single Self. It is this latter statement
that she is so resolute in confirming and why the last sentence the
audience will hear on Saturday night is Eleanor Moira Keady on stage
asserting ''I am Eleanor Moira Keady!''
* The Room and Fragmentalisation are at the Tron Theatre on Saturday
October 14 at 8pm only.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975896767</RECORDNO>

IT may seem curious, but all three main parties have been favoured
with exceptionally good conferences. The Tories', which ended yesterday
with Mr Major on excellent form, was easily the most unexpected. The
party has long been rent over Europe and had just received a humiliating
blow in the defection of an MP to Labour as the conference opened. In
the event the defection caused less damage than seemed possible at the
beginning of the week; and the divisions over Europe proved to be
containable, though they could not be papered over. There is little
doubt that the party moved to a position which was clearly more hostile
than before to the European Union. In some cases, the anti-European
movement was far too extreme: Mr Portillo's savage attack on Brussels
may have injured himself more than his target, for it cast doubts on his
judgment and his capacity for restraint. He may live to regret it: even
though the conference audience clearly loved it, a wider, more
discriminating audience outside the hall seems to have been dismayed.
For the Prime Minister personally, the outcome was welcome. He was
overshadowed by Mr Heseltine as a performer, and possibly by the
Chancellor as the harbinger of lower personal taxation, but there was no
doubting his authority. He benefited enormously from the gamble he took
during the summer when he challenged the Euro-sceptics to contest his
leadership formally, and then resoundingly defeated Mr Redwood, the sole
man brave enough to pick up the gauntlet. Mr Major (as was shown in
April 1992) is a doughty campaigner. He may prove to be a harder man to
beat than recent opinion poll findings would suggest. The Tory themes
for the General Election have certainly been established. The renewed
emphasis on law and order may simply reflect the party's insistence on
reclaiming this issue from Labour's takeover bid (as in Mr Blair's
famous declaration to be ''tough on crime, tough on the causes of
crime''). In fact the Home Secretary's latest prescription, which
invited speedy repudiation from distinguished judges, may prove to be
counter-productive. Do we really need longer prison sentences (and so
more prisons) when we already have Europe's largest prison population?
And is it desirable to focus so much of our energies on punishing
malefactors while saying nothing about their rehabilitation? It serves
little social purpose to imprison criminals if the effect is to harden
and confirm them in their anti-social tendencies. Somehow, it was hard
to identify a considered, cerebral element in Mr Howard's presentation.
Its popularity was evident (and some of the promises, like extra
policemen, are welcome) but the party faithful are seldom a
discriminating audience where their own prejudices are deeply engaged.
In his way, Mr Howard went as far as Mr Portillo in his: the effect was
certainly as regrettable.
There was also a renewed emphasis on lower personal taxes from both
the Chancellor and the Prime Minister who believe that Labour remains
vulnerable on this issue. Of course, it was impossible to be too
specific -- we are too close to the Budget -- and anyhow the sums can
change unexpectedly, as occurred with the mid-week inflation figures
pushing another #700m-#800m on to the social security budget. Yet there
was no mistaking the conviction with which both Ministers spoke about
this subject. There will be tax cuts next month and promises of more
next year, if the hazards of life and by-elections allow the Government
to last long enough.
In short, it looks as if the Tories managed to regain their spirit and
to buttress their morale. That was a considerable achievement, as was
the evident stamp of authority which Mr Major has reimpressed on his
troops.

ON Monday coming, about three in the afternoon, two double-ended car
ferries, Loch Fyne and Isle of Cumbrae, will mournfully chug for a final
time across the narrows of Kyleakin; Monday sees the opening of the Skye
bridge, and Monday sees the end of what, for most of us in this country,
was the definitive Skye ferry.
Actually, the crossing from Kyle of Lochalsh to Kyleakin is neither
the oldest nor even the shortest passage from Skye to the mainland. That
route is over the narrows of Kylerhea, some miles to the south, where
the channel is only 300 yards at its narrowest. Here, almost until
living memory, drovers would ''swim'' roped herds of cattle to the
mainland, bound for the south and the great market at Falkirk. Cows and
men slipped to Skye by this passage when Kyle of Lochalsh did not exist
as a community.
But the Kyleakin crossing, if broader, has become the most convenient
door to Eilean a Cheo. Since early this century, Kyle had a railway link
to Inverness. That's brought hotels, shops, churches, and every
convenience for the tourist. Then, Kyle (and Kyleakin) are easy to reach
from landward; the roads are good and follow the level shore. To reach
the Kylerhea ferry you must climb crazy single-track roads over
precipitous mountains. The views are majestic but it's not for nervous
drivers or coach tours.
True, Kyleakin is an exposed stretch of water, open to the Inner Sound
and all the forces of the North Minch and the Atlantic beyond. It can
whip up a fair storm, now and again, and even in the past decade
Caledonian MacBrayne have had some hair-raising escapades with their
ferries. But the Kylerhea passage has a notorious tide-race -- as high
as eight knots on the ebb -- and is much more demanding on seamanship.
In the old days, of course, no-one in the West Highlands gave a hoot
for short and convenient crossings. Roads varied from poor to
non-existent; land travel was always arduous, and often unpleasant.
Folk, even Victorian tourists -- travelled to the West Highlands by sea.
And, into our own century, most serious travellers came to Skye by
long-haul steamer -- from Mallaig, from Oban, from Stornoway. The
crossings at Kyleakin and Kylerhea were of little account. Locals in the
immediate vicinity used them, of course, and they were handy for the
freight of livestock. And that was that.
What made the short sea crossing was the coming of the motor car. And
metalled roads. And the rise, after the First World War, of motoring as
a hobby for the well-off, and increasingly as an essential skill for
professional gentry. The Great War was not long over when car-ferries
began to ply at Kyleakin and Kylerhea, and, by the time the Germans came
at us again, Kyleakin had emerged as the handiest and best-known route.
The railway companies promoted it -- the LMS owned the vessels and, in
the Second World War, took over operation of the service, through its
marine subsidiary, the Caledonian Steam Packet Company, Ltd, of Gourock.
The ferry passed by a bonnie ruin, the crumbling Castle Moil, above
Kyleakin. Kyleakin itself was a bonnie village. And, in publicity to die
for, the Duke and Duchess of York -- she still lives, of course, as our
everlasting Queen Mother -- made an official trip to Skye, by the
Kyleakin ferry, in the thirties.
The Kyleakin route has stood the rest of time. The Kylerhea ferry has
repeatedly suspended operation and, since the early seventies, has not
run in winter at all.
The first ferries at Kyleakin, of course, were ordinary boats -- big
rowing cobles, sailing dinghies, latterly motor-launches like the Skye
and the first Coruisk. The odd car -- and cars were unusual things in
Skye 75 years ago -- had to board amidships by a pair of planks and be
tied in precarious balance for the crossing -- or be towed over on a
pontoon
Car ferries are not easy things to design. A ramp is one thing, but
where do you put it on a classic hull shape? You need the stern for the
engine, rudder and so on, and the bow is pointed. The landing-craft
design is the first that comes to mind, with a single ramp on a square,
planed bow. But landing craft are not cheap to build and, in those days,
were hard to make sufficiently seaworthy for West Highland winters. And
then there was this darned awkward thing called the tide.
The identity of the guy who solved the problem, and came up with an
ingenious ferry design ideal for West Highland conditions -- moreover,
it was cheap, and traditional beamy boats could be readily adapted -- is
lost in history.
We know he was based at the Ballachulish Hotel and in charge of the
Ballachulish ferry. And, in the early twenties, he came up with a boat
called the Glencoe. The Glencoe's car deck was a turntable. It stood on
a swivel amidships; the Glencoe could berth alongside a stone slipway,
the crew could turn her car-deck to point ashore, and the single jalopy
could drive triumphantly off. At any state of tide. And the driver
didn't even have to reverse.
The turntable ferry is unique to the Scottish Highlands and, in its
day, was something of an institution, a sight as Teuchter as mist on the
hills, shaggy cattle by the burn, and those jars of whisky-flavoured
marmalade with the silly frilly caps. Turntable ferries, in their day,
operated at Luing, Bonawe, Corran, Ballachulish, Dornie, Kylerhea,
Kyleakin, Strome, Scalpay, Kylescu, and even Kessock, by Inverness. They
were brilliant. There's only one left now, the Glenachulish at Kylerhea,
and it should be listed at once as a national monument.
The first turntable ferry at Kyleakin was called, for want of
something more imaginative, Kyleakin. She was built in 1928 of timber
and could carry a singe car. She was later lengthened and re-engined to
carry two cars. She was joined, about 1932, by a similar vessel called
the Moil.
They ran in conjunction with motor launches, like the Coruisk. Traffic
grew steadily. The slipways at Kyle and Kyleakin were improved. Early in
the Second World War the ferries acquired a new sister. The Cuillin was
also limited to two cars, but she was built of steel and was a sturdy
sea boat. All three were purposeful car-carriers. They didn't even have
shelter for the crew, never mind the passengers. And they were all
single-screw ships.
And so it grew, and grew.
1951 brought another ferry, the Lochalsh. She was little more than a
repeat of the Cuillin; but Easter of the following year brought the
Portree, built by Denny's of Dumbarton. She was larger and much more
sophisticated. The Portree had twin screws, powerful Perkins diesels,
and could carry four cars on her big turntable. And, at her stern, she
boasted a commodious passenger saloon topped by two enclosed steering
positions for the chargehand.
She was a great wee boat. The new de luxe design was most successful,
and in 1954 the Portree was joined by the very similar Broadford. The
Lochalsh was retained as a spare and the older boats, redundant, were
sold.
It was the age of affluence. Motoring boomed and tourism boomed. More
and more folk. every summer, drove to Skye. By 1957 the CSP needed more
capacity. It came in the form of a six-car turntable ferry, a new
Lochalsh. Built by Ailsa of Troon. The old Lochalsh was sold. In 1960,
as traffic continued to expand, Ailsa repeated the work, with a new
six-car ferry called Kyleakin.
It was in the sixties that the CSP began to lose control of things.
They now had four ships on the Kyleakin station; at peak periods they
were increasingly forced to operate all at once. The jetties had to be
improved, on either side of the channel, to allow simultaneous loading.
By 1963 they had three berths at Kyle and two at Kyleakin. Still the
tourists came. For the first time the disadvantages of turntable ferries
became apparent. They were cumbersome to operate, wearing on their crew,
unable to carry very long or heavy loads.
The CSP was now a marginalised subsidiary of British Rail,
underfunded, unambitious. The Kyleakin ferry was, by 1964, a veritable
goldmine. But it was increasingly marked by lengthy delays, mile-long
queues, frustration and bad publicity. Kyleakin had replaced the old
Portree mailroute as the front door to Skye. Worse, it was now -- for
many -- the front door to Lewis, Harris and Uist. MacBraynes, in 1964,
had started a car ferry service from Uig in Skye to Tarbert and
Lochmaddy. The new service was a big hit and brought many more vehicles
through Skye.
The old Portree and Broadford were withdrawn and replaced by namesakes
of optimistic design. The new Portree, built by Lamont of Port Glasgow
in 1965, had no turntable and no passenger shelter. Her little
wheelhouse was in the bow and she loaded nine cars by angled side ramps.
The Broadford of 1967 was like her, save for a wheelhouse in the stern.
Finally -- desperately -- the CSP built a new Coruisk, like the
Broadford but complete with passenger shelter. They now had five little
ferries on the Kyleakin station; the delays grew worse by the summer,
and the new side-loading design wasn't a great improvement.
The Skye ferry needed money and vision. It got it that same year,
1969, when the new Scottish Transport Group took over British Rail's
Clyde marine arm. The STG also took over David MacBrayne Ltd. It wasn't
until 1973 that they were officially merged, but Caledonian MacBrayne
was born, as a state-owned Highland ferry fleet, at the end of the
sixties. And it was born with big money and big ideas.
The new management saw the solution at once. The five wee ferries
should be replaced with two big ones. And these should be end-loading
craft -- double-ended, in fact -- with neither bow nor stern, but a ramp
at both ends, and a high steering position looking both ways, and
Voith-Schneider propulsion units for great manoeuvrability. (These,
invented in Germany before the war, aren't like propellers at all. They
look like big food-mixers pointing from the bottom of the ship and have
vertical vanes, the pitch of which can be turned for thrust in any
direction you choose. A boat with Voith-Schneider units can go forwards,
backwards, sideways, or spin like a sixpence.
So the CSP happily invited tenders for two big 28-car double-ended
ferries with Voith-Schneider propulsion. An order was placed with a yard
in Monmouthshire, South Wales -- the first the company had ever
allocated furth of Scotland or even furth of the Clyde. And Inverness
County Council began building big, steep new slipways at Kyle and
Kyleakin.
The new craft were due for the start of the 1970 season. Things went
badly wrong. The ferries were not delivered on time. Parts shortages,
teething troubles, and strikes caused delay upon delay. The new
Kyleakin, in the end, was towed to the Clyde by a hysterical CSP to be
finished off properly. She didn't start service to Skye until September.
(Building the new slipways, by the way, had left only one side-loading
berth operational either side of the passage: the five small boats had
to queue to unload, and the delays that summer were appalling.)
The new Lochalsh wasn't sailing until August 1971. But, after assorted
kinks were ironed out -- hydraulic faults, ramp faults, engine faults --
and the crew were trained in the new modern operation, the service was
transformed. Queueing vanished. Mighty pantechnicons and long,low
coaches could now make the crossing. Like two huge and elegant swans
gliding over the channel, the new ferries made the service their own.
They were relieved in winter by various little bow-loaders and, from
1986, by the 18-car double-ended Isle of Cumbrae.
There might not be a Skye bridge at all if CalMac had kept a note of
rising traffic and ordered a third vessel, of similar size, for the Kyle
service about 1980. But they didn't. And, in 1986, a big new ferry on
the Uig-Tarbert-Lochmaddy run encouraged more Lewis traffic to go by
Skye. By the late eighties delays and bother had returned. The old boats
were now too small. They were also buckling with age. Engine breakdown
became frequent; sometimes the tide would strand one on a slip, and
block the route for hours.
The threat of a Skye bridge seems, absurdly, to have deterred CalMac
from ordering new tonnage. But then perhaps the Scottish Office, eager
for a freemarket bridge experiment, was not unduly upset at the
deteriorating ferry service. A spectacular mishap some eight years ago
-- when the Kyleakin, heading across in a strong wind, broke down and
was blown as far as Loch Duich, quite out of control, tossed by foaming
billows, laden with cars and terrified passengers -- could have been a
major tragedy.
It was a big public relations disaster for CalMac. It emerged, among
other things, that the ferries weren't even equipped with ship-to-shore
radio. So the campaign for a Skye bridge became a clamour.
Only when the bridge deal was finally approved and announced did the
Scottish Office suffer CalMac to order new Skye ferries. The 40-car Loch
Fyne and Loch Dunvegan, Clyde-built, took over at Kyle in 1991. The old
ferries were sold for further service in Ireland.
The Loch Dunvegan and Loch Fyne are unlikely to follow them. They have
many years of useful life left for CalMac, and the company has already
employed them on various routes. But the Scottish Office has forbidden
CalMac to compete with the new bridge. And the efforts of a last-ditch
ad hoc private company to find a suitable ferry -- even, indeed,
permission to use the terminals -- have, so far, come to nothing.
Two final memories:
In 1965, an uncle of mine, the Rev Angus Smith (he was then Free
Church minister at Snizort, Skye) made world headlines by blockading
cars disembarking from the very first Sunday ferry to Kyleakin. He was
arrested and briefly put in the cells. The CSP's insistence on
introducing a Sunday service against the manifest wishes of the
islanders -- three-quarters of them signed a petition against the
innovation -- showed contempt for local feeling which would not, I
think, be essayed today. But Smith and his followers, having won their
moment of glory, failed to stop Sabbath sailings. They have continued
and expanded.
From about the 1930s, more and more people -- many of impeccable
character, sobriety and scepticism -- were shaken by the sight of a
ghost car, near the Kyle ferry, heading for it or away from it, both on
Skye and Wester Ross. This car was black, extremely fast, and you saw it
hurtling towards you on the single-track road. So you pulled in, and
waited, and waited in the passing place -- and saw it no more. It would
vanish into thin air. Or it would disappear into an intervening bend and
never emerge.
One man had a real fright; the car actually passed him, and he glanced
to see if he knew the driver -- and there was no-one, no-one at all, in
the car.
Through the forties, through the fifties, sightings of the Wee Black
Car continued. It became an institution. I've met some who, as children,
used to look out for it.
And then, in about 1960, a Free Presbyterian minister boarded the
Kyleakin ferry. He was travelling with two women and a child. The car
was not his own, but the lady owner had asked the minister to do the
difficult job of boarding the turntable craft. He must have made a
mistake. The car boarded, did not stop, ran the full length of the deck,
knocked the opposite ramp down, and plunged into the sea.
The water wasn't deep. The car roof actually broke the surface.
Aghast, onlookers could see those inside. A crewman leapt from the
ferry, balanced on the car roof, and battered on the windows with an
axe. They refused to break. Somehow the minister, a corpulent man,
struggled free. The women and the child drowned.
Yes, it was a black car. And yes, the other car, the mystery one, was
never seen again.

Alan Bold believes that the most remarkable thing about the top-ten
list on National Poetry Day was the number of great poets who were
overlooked
NATIONAL Poetry Day, courtesy of the Beeb, produced a list of
Britain's top ten poets as reported in The Herald. It's a rather
listless list, kicking off with Kipling's iffy If -- the late Harold
Wilson's favourite poem which could be good news for the latest Labour
leader, Tony Blair, who ''can't wait, and not be tired waiting'' as the
exceedingly popular Mr Kipling says -- and concluding with Yeats (just
after Keats), who confessed:
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light... I would spread the cloths
under your feet...
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
Dreams are difficult.
The dream team then, just one longshot short of a football team,
reads: Kipling, Tennyson, Walter de la Mare, Stevie Smith (Not Waving
but Drowning), Wordsworth, Keats, Yeats, Wilfred Owen, Keats again,
Yeats again. Bad news for Scotland with no player in this national
poetic team and bad news for Wales with no poet in the park.
It's astonishing that Burns was not voted on to the team, considering
how popular this voteless versifier's poems and songs are with the
world's worthiest: American Presidents sing Auld Lang Syne in the White
House, Russian children chant A Man's a Man for a' That.
It's equally astonishing that Dylan Thomas was not selected for the
team, considering how appealing his lyrics are to those who know about
poetry. Those like myself who consider Dylan's Do Not Go Gentle into
that ood Night the most lively look at death in our literature.
And what about Philip Larkin? I know he was never politically correct,
having a fascist father and a dogmatic faith in Maggie Thatcher, but he
wrote one of the finest poems of this century. The Whitsun Weddings,
which I heard read by John Betjeman -- and what happened to Betjemania
on National Poetry Day? -- has one of the most wonderful endings of any
poem:
We slowed again,
And as the tightened brakes took hold, there swelled
A sense of falling, like an arrow-shower
Sent out of sight, somewhere becoming rain.
I vividly remember discussing this piece of verse with Norman
MacCaig (and what happened to all those Beeb folk who phone in
requesting Big Norman's poems?) who bought me a nip or two for
explaining what it meant: an image of married lives beginning on an
upward curve, like an arrow aiming at a target, but coming down to earth
like a downpour.
And I remember vividly discussing this piece of verse with Douglas
Dunn (and what happened to all those folk who appreciated Douglas's
marvellously poignant Elegies?) and he, who knew Larkin well, told me
Larkin had told him the passage meant to cite a scene from Olivier's
movie Henry V but I don't think Philip was telling Douglas the whole
truth on that occasion.
The whole truth on this occasion is that National Poetry Day is a
pretentious advertisement for some old stuff -- some old stuffy poetry
by the likes of Tennyson (number two on that national chart, remember,
the same old stuff he copied from Keats), ignoring the evidence of real
excellence in the art of poetry. If Kipling &amp; Co are the most popular
poets then it means poetic populists have clearly had their day, and
that day does nothing for the deserving cause of poetry.
For me, and hopefully millions like me, poetry is an important issue
that needs a more important image than Kipling's If. It depends on
imagery, like Eliot (unlisted in the list for National Poetry Day)
creatively wasting what happened in the First World War, like slighted
Auden becoming more than Yeats when he remembered the listed man, like
unlisted Lowell comparing a curving, sleeping woman he loved to a
question mark.
A question remains. How can so many people lovingly vote for Kipling
when Eliot and his ilk are about in print? It is beyond me though, as
Kipling asked, is it art?
Poetry, to paraphrase the unlisted Sylvia Plath, is an art like
anything else. She went through hell but where the hell was she on the
listless list? Nowhere, like her outstandingly excellent husband,
unlisted Ted. National Poetry Day, courtesy of the Beeb, takes us
nowhere worth knowing. Only If.

Washington
O J SIMPSON is having trouble capitalising on his troubles but others
find it a snip. One of the jurors will be in Playboy in a month or so,
in a mock-up of a courtroom, and nothing else.
Tracy Hampton, a 26-year-old airline stewardess, dropped out of the
jury several months before the trial ended, so she is not one of those
women who have been popping up on television to explain that they cared
nothing for allegations of spouse abuse.
She persuaded the judge to excuse her last May on the grounds she
couldn't take the strain any more.
Playboy commissioned a Hollywood studio to build a model of the most
famous courtroom in the world, and Ms Hampton spent a lucrative day on
Thursday posing for tasteful pictures and a video.
Throughout the trial, cameras were not permitted to photograph the
jurors, nor could the media publish their names. This was to protect
their privacy, a concern also met by locking them away in a motel for
the duration.
Now they are free at last -- but none has asserted her freedom more
nakedly than Ms Hampton.

Dusseldorf
A YOUNG right-wing thug gave a contemptuous neo-Nazi salute today
after a German court jailed him and three others for the racist murder
of five Turkish women and girls in a 1993 arson attack.
Five judges sentenced 25-year-old Markus Gartmann to 15 years for
murder, attempted murder, and arson, and gave maximum 10-year juvenile
terms to Felix Koehnen, 18, Christian Reher, 19, and Christian Buchholz,
22.
The attack in the town of Solingen was the worst in a three- year wave
of racist and neo-Nazi violence after unification in 1990. It unleashed
worldwide consternation that Germany seemed unable to banish the spectre
of Nazi race hatred.
However the verdict was the latest in a series of rulings to hit
right-wing extremism with the full force of the law.
Reher, who had confessed and told the family there could be no excuse
for his crime, made a three-fingered neo-Nazi salute as he was driven
away past waiting cameras.
There was uproar in court among the other accused.
''I'm going to kill myself today. There won't be any appeal,'' yelled
Koehnen, just 16 at the time of the attack.
His father began to weep and ran from the chamber. Relatives of the
accused in the gallery shouted ''You swine!'' at the presiding judge.
Ankara's ambassador to Germany, Volkan Vural, welcomed the verdict.
''We have always believed in German justice and today we were proved
right,'' he said.
''I hope today's verdict will help to reduce racism and xenophobia in
Germany and Europe,'' he added, expressing confidence in authorities'
ability to protect Germany's large community of Turkish ''guest
workers''.
All the victims, aged between four and 27, were members of the
extended Genc family. The relatives, including 17-year-old Bekir who
suffered 36% burns and still had his face swathed in bandages, were
impassive as the verdicts were read.
The accused, who all intended to appeal against the verdict, had
dabbled in neo-Nazism. Steffen said they had ''made the slogan
'Foreigners Out!' their watchword''. Two had far-right or Nazi flags on
their bedroom walls.
Steffen made clear, however, that the youths had no real concept of
Nazi ideology. Like many who have perpetrated similar attacks, they used
it to fill gaping holes in inadequate lives owing to problems in
childhood and adolescence.
Reher went to three children's homes and two sets of foster parents.
Gartmann struggled to complete school and was easily led. Buchholz was
thrown out of the army and failed to complete three apprenticeships.
All were drunk when they met in the early hours of May 29, 1993 and
decided to ''give the Turks something to think about''.
The judge said the crime was of a ''barely comprehensible dimension''
that left no room for mitigating circumstances.
The verdict came at the end of a tortuous 18-month trial which was
plagued by conflicting confessions from two of the defendants and by
reports of investigators' blunders.
The attack on the Genc home provoked several days of riots by Turks in
Solingen, an industrial town in western Germany, and calls for
improvements in what many regard as the second-class status of
foreigners living in Germany.
The town's Turkish community, fearing a violent reaction if any of the
accused were acquitted, had issued a statement saying the verdict should
be respected regardless of how it turned out. There were no reports of
any disturbances in the city.--Reuter.

Paolo Gucci, designer and failed tycoon; died October 10 at 64
HARMONY has never found house-room among the Guccis, and even in
death, Paolo, the grandson of the fashion empire's founder, has once
more set the blood rampaging through the family's veins.
Today there is no controlling Gucci in the company but for years
before the Bahrain-based financial group, Investcorp, took full control
in 1993, the deceased's name was banished among those brothers and
cousins still associated with the deluxe Italian label.
This month Investcorp plans to go public with Gucci by floating up to
$350m of its shares. That kind of money was never beyond Paolo's claims
on avarice or, indeed, those of any other Gucci, and that, of course,
has always been the problem.
Now, as preparations are being made for his burial in Florence, the
city of his birth, writs demanding substantial chunks of his estate are
almost as numerous as the black-edged letters of condolence. And, as
ever in such tales, there is more than one widow and at least one
mistress directing lawyers in the midst of grief.
But then the rich are not like the rest of us. They mourn with one eye
on legacies, the other on the corpse. Paolo Gucci, who died from liver
failure in a London hospital last Tuesday, was 64, a declared bankrupt
who had gained #27m from his sale of Gucci shares in 1989 and who,
despite his subsequent fall from tycoonry, is thought to have left
assets of around #3m.
These mostly concern his Tudor mansion in Rusper, West Sussex, the
stables there, and a string of Arabian horses. Paolo insisted that the
animals belonged to Penny Armstrong, the 25-year-old former stablehand
who became his mistress and the mother of his two young children, but at
one time he faced allegations of starving the thoroughbreds.
Now Penny plays sorrowful host to Paolo's first ex-wife, Yvonne
Moschetto, and the couple's adult daughters who arrived at the mansion
from Italy to pay their respects.
Meanwhile, his estranged second spouse, Jenny, displayed an expensive
modicum of tact by checking into a Mayfair hotel. For the past five
years she had been pursuing Paolo through the courts to make him pay at
least #320,000 in child support for Gemma, their 12-year-old daughter
now resident with her mother in New York.
Jenny Gucci, once an opera singer, believes the estate is worth more
than #10m. Paolo's death, she says with piquant understatement, is not
going to ease things because ''everything was made such a mess.''
However, one week before he died Paolo signed a restructuring plan to
pay back creditors, including Jenny, over a seven-year period.
''Obviously no-one was expecting him to die so suddenly,'' says his
lawyer who maintains that the estate's value is about #3m.
For the creditors' part it will fall to their trustee to prove that
the prized horses did, in fact, belong to the deceased and not to the
mistress. But Penny, some insist, can take care of herself and is
confident that a deal can be worked out which does not exclude her, yet
still satisfies all sides.
''She certainly won't end up a millionairess,'' one family friend
reflects. ''She drives a battered Ford Fiesta, and Gucci didn't provide
for her when he was alive because he was insolvent.''
Paolo Gucci, whose grandfather, Guccio founded the fashion house on
leather goods and jewellery in 1906, was once its design director, but
he rowed with the family so seriously in 1987 he slammed the door on the
empire to establish his own label.
The acrimony, though, existed long before that date. Indeed by 1987,
his father Aldo, the company patriarch and then in his eighties, had
completed a one-year prison sentence in America for tax evasion, the
evidence having been laid before the US authorities by none other than
his son.
Revenge acquired further complicated twists when Paolo was banned from
trading on the famous surname, and he sought legal action against his
cousin, alleging that Maurizio, then president of the company, had
misused proxy voting shares.
Now both men are dead, Maurizio having been gunned down in Milan by an
unknown assassin last March. Nothing had been stolen from his person.
Nothing had been disturbed in his office. It was, said police, a swift
pavement execution: two bullets in the face, two bullets in the back.
In the early 1990s, the Gucci group sank into the red, but since last
year it has returned to impressive profit, and this week its latest
collection in Milan received ecstatic reviews from international
retailers and press. But the irony of this success will not be lost on
the remaining Guccis, for the hand that guides its fortunes now is
Texan, belonging to one of America's funkiest designers, Tom Ford.
Despite their Florentine elan, the Guccis often mistook arrogance for
style and greed for proper business practice. Being married to them,
Jenny Gucci once openly observed, was like ''sitting down to dinner with
the Borgias''.
For a while luxury's superior handiwork endowed their name with
sacramental status, but warring egomania and betrayal placed a curse on
all of that. What people may come to remember of them is not a dynasty
of excellence, but a family driven to the precipice of Mammon.

Robert Marshall Hunter, amateur operatic performer and civil engineer;
died October 5, 1995
ROBERT MARSHALL HUNTER, who died at his home in Crieff on October 5,
was one of the outstanding performers on the amateur stage in the West
of Scotland during the postwar years. A skilled games player in his
youth and an able golfer for most of his life, he gained his first stage
experience playing principal parts with the Uddingston Operatic Society
in the 1930s.
During the war he entertained the troops and others with ENSA concert
parties. Later he appeared with the Wilson Barrett Company and at
Rutherglen Rep, but his longest association was with the Orpheus Club in
Glasgow, which has had a continuous record of productions of the Savoy
operas of Gilbert and Sullivan since 1892.
With the Orpheus he played the G &amp; S comedy roles -- Koko, Jack Point
etc -- for a record 28 years between 1945 and 1972 to critical and
popular acclaim. Bob Hunter's portrayals of these subtle parts are still
clearly remembered for their warmth and humanity, and his nimble
precision.
During most of these years the Orpheus producer was Margaret Eadie, a
cultured and talented former member of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. Her
opera productions for the Drawing Room Music Society (pre-Scottish
Opera) included The Beggar's Opera in which Bob Hunter appeared. In
addition he took part in several of Margaret Eadie's presentations of G
&amp; S and light opera in Stirling, Broughty Ferry, Alloa, and for many
years Dunoon.
For 30 and more years he compered many hundreds of concerts for
audiences all over west and central Scotland in a friendly and jocular
style. His own repertoire at these concerts, apart from the Gilbert and
Sullivan favourites, included a number of evergreens such as Phil the
Fluter's Ball and The Wee Toon Clerk, the latter particularly admired by
no less a person than Aaron Copland at the 1962 dinner of the Glasgow
Society of Musicians of which Bob was a convivial member.
After 1972 he continued to perform both in straight plays (notably
with the Torch Theatre Company) and in concerts. When he retired from
his employment as a civil engineer with British Railways, after a time
in Bridge of Allan, he and his wife Alison went to live in Crieff.
Alison had been appointed as principal music teacher at Morrison's
Academy and Bob was able to help aspiring Morrisonian Savoyards in the
school's G &amp; S productions.
He was still able to delight with expert renderings of Phil the
Fluter's Ball and Tit Willow up to the last few weeks of his long,
active life. He is survived by his wife.

George Macleod, DVSM, MRCVS, pioneer of homoeopathic veterinary
surgery; born October 30, 1912, died September 6, 1995
GEORGE MacLEOD will be remembered for his great interest and expertise
in practising homoeopathy. Born in Glasgow in 1912, he graduated from
Glasgow Veterinary School in December 1939.
While awaiting enlistment, he undertook a diploma in veterinary
medicine which turned out to be timely because he was later posted to
Bath in the summer of 1942 during the extensive outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in the area.
He married the same year and set up practice in Sutherland where the
family lived till 1966. It was there that he began to incorporate
homoeopathy into his work. He had first been introduced to homoeopathy
by his cousin, the late Dr Isobel Campbell, who had worked with Dr
George Macalpine (1890-1969), the noted Glasgow physician and
homoeopath.
From the mid-1960s, with the help of sympathetic farmers in Cheshire,
Devon, and Worcestershire, he carried out the ''provings'' of veterinary
homeopathic nosodes (substances in some ways similar to conventional
vaccines) which are now in widespread use.
He walked his way of life with determination and fortitude, often in
the face of tremendous opposition and difficulty, bordering at times on
ridicule even, from the more conventionally minded members of the
veterinary profession. In 1978 he set up a purely homoeopathic practice
in Haywards Heath, Sussex, which grew rapidly, with clients coming from
all over the country.
George Macleod became the first British homoeopathic veterinary
surgeon to address the International Congress of Homeopathic Medicine,
in Vienna in 1973. Throughout the 1970s he published a series of papers
in the British Homoeopathic Journal. In 1982 he was one of the founder
members of the British Association of Homoeopathic Veterinary Surgeons,
and its first president.
Without him veterinary homeopathy would not exist as the thriving
force it is today. He helped to develop the veterinary courses at the
Faculty of Homoeopathy in London and lectured there for a number of
years. He also addressed many lay and professional groups, including
seminars arranged by the American Association of Holistic Medicine in
Washington DC in 1982, 1983, and 1984, and, in Philadelphia in 1988,
veterinarians from all over the world.
During the 1980s he wrote a series of popular reference books for the
homoeopathic treatment of cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, and cats, and a
very useful veterinary Materia Medica. He was admitted to membership of
the faculty of Homoeopathy in 1987 and gained his fellowship in 1992.
He was always willing to share his knowledge and to give help at any
time. Friends will remember his warm smile and quiet sense of humour. He
leaves two sons, David and Kenneth, and a daughter, Nora.

Canon John Lewis McWilliam, Scotland's oldest working priest; born
October 26, 1903, died October 10, 1995
THE Catholic Church in Scotland and the whole Christian community in
the north-east of the country mourned the death this week of 91-year-old
Canon John Lewis McWilliam who spent the 66 years of his priestly life
working and caring for others regardless of their religion.
The parish priest of St Margaret's, Huntly, had a philosophy in life
-- not to worry, enjoy everything in moderation, and have a lively faith
in divine providence. Divine providence was certainly kind to Canon
McWilliam. He never considered retirement and was allowed to work until
he died on Tuesday afternoon. He was the oldest working priest in
Scotland if not Britain.
That morning he met the other canons of Aberdeen diocese for their
monthly meeting in the city, enjoyed lunch with them, then returned home
alone to Huntly where he had been parish priest since 1977, and died. He
will be buried on Monday after Requiem Mass in his church.
Although he owned a car, the canon, who was affectionately called
''the Pope'' by the people of Huntly, was regularly seen riding his
bicycle or walking round his parish visiting his parishioners. He always
thought it amusing that one of his visits was to see the ''old folk'' in
the local geriatric hospital.
Born in Buckie, where his father was a master baker, he was educated
at the local primary school, then continued at St Mary's College,
Blairs, near Aberdeen, which was the junior seminary for Scotland. From
there he went to the Royal Scots College in Valadolid in Spain where he
was ordained in May, 1929. His fellow students included Joseph McGhee,
later to become Bishop of Galloway, and William Hart, later to become
Bishop of Dunkeld.
After ordination, Canon McWilliam returned to Scotland where his first
appointment was to St Mary's Cathedral in Aberdeen. Fifteen months later
he was made parish priest in Stonehaven. Then there were only 60 souls,
unlike today where there are over 600 because of the oil boom.
There followed a five-year spell back in St Mary's Cathedral as
administrator for the late Bishop Walsh. During his time there a young
curate, Father Mario Conti, joined him and of course went on to become
Bishop Conti. The canon always had a twinkle in his eye when he recalled
those days and joked with his fellow priests: ''I prepared him for high
office.''
The death of his twin brother at the age of 10 had a major effect on
his life, as did the death of his cousin when they were both students in
Spain. The canon's older brother, Alexander, was also a priest, having
been ordained in Rome. He went on to become a noted historian and was
appointed Monsignor in the Aberdeen diocese.
In his later years Canon McWilliam cooked and looked after himself. He
made sure each morning he had his porridge and at lunchtime his own
home-made soup. He enjoyed a dram of whisky but, like everthing else, it
was in moderation. He also smoked.
He was strongly in favour of modern seminary students having a course
in domestic science before ordination so that when they were appointed
to a parish they would not have to rely on a housekeeper but would be
able to look after themselves.
He enjoyed telling the story of how a couple whom he had married
celebrated their silver wedding and in their notice in the local paper
said they had been married by the late Canon McWilliam. He pointed out
to them he certainly was not dead yet and the couple happily corrected
their mistake.
The canon confessed that if he had not been a priest he would have
loved to have been a farmer. He would tell friends: ''On a summer day I
would love to be behind a plough with a pair of horses. But that is
looking at life through coloured spectacles.''
During his 66 years as a priest, Canon John Lewis McWilliam has been
gathering in a very special harvest. Now he is enjoying the fruits
reserved for a good and faithful servant.

William Martin: an appreciation
MR WILLIAM MARTIN, the former North British Locomotive Company
transport manager, stockbroker, and entrepreneur, has died at St
Margaret's Hospice in Clydebank. He was 92.
Born at Ardrossan into a family with strong seafaring traditions, Mr
Martin was sent to boarding school in the hope he would follow a
different path, but at the age of 14 absconded and went to sea himself.
On returning to Scotland during the twenties, he joined his father's
stockbroker firm in Glasgow which collapsed during the Depression.
After the war Mr Martin joined the North British Locomotive Company at
Springburn in Glasgow in the welfare department and quickly progressed
to the position of transport manager in 1947.
In this role he supervised the movement of the large locomotives made
at the works to Finnieston docks on the Clyde, where the engines were
hoisted on to ships by the famous Finnieston Cran' and exported.
Often locomotives had to be hauled over cobblestones through Glasgow,
with Mr Martin directing teams of straining North British workmen in
front of crowds of local Springburn folk who lined the streets to watch.
In 1962 he left the company to become a co-partner in Glasgow-based
Robert Smith Electrical Engineers. Soon after, Mr Martin formed his own
company, Milngavie Controls, of which he was director until his death.
He is survived by two daughters, Ann and Pam.

Dr Gerald Isaac Macdonald Swyer, FRCP, pioneer endocrinologist, died
September 19, 1995
DR Gerald Isaac Macdonald Swyre may not be a household name, but he
deserves to be; for his early work with progestogenic hormones led to
the development of the oral contraceptive pill, one of the defining
discoveries of this century. He then went on to conduct pioneering
research into the treatment of premenstrual syndrome and the use of
Hormone Replacement Therapy for women after their menopause.
Most of his work was done at University College Hospital, London,
where he became consultant endocrinologist in 1951 and set up and
directed the college's work in fertility. The naming of a familial form
of ovarian abnormality as ''The Swyer Syndrome'' reflects the respect in
which he was held by his medical colleagues.
Gerald Swyer was a man of enormous intelligence. Born in 1917, he was
educated at St Paul's School, Magdalen College, and St John's College,
Oxford, the University of California and Middlesex Medical School. His
path was strewn with scholarships, exhibitions, and awards from school
to university and throughout his career.
For all his academic distinction, he was a caring man, both for his
patients to whom he was always ready to offer explanation of treatment
and reassurance, as well as for his community in Camden which he served
as a local councillor.
After his retirement, he became the first chairman of Women's Health
Concern, briefing health workers on preventative gynaecology and
endocrinology. He also served as Secretary General of the International
Federation of Fertility Societies.

Brussels
BELGIAN parliamentary investigators last night questioned Nato
secretary general Willy Claes about his role in the Agusta bribery
scandal.
His career in Nato, currently deeply involved in the Bosnia peace
effort, depends on the outcome.
After a six-hour hearing, Mr Claes reiterated his innocence.
''I had the opportunity to confirm that I am totally innocent,'' he
said.
Under Belgian constitutional law Mr Claes can be stripped of his
immunity if the special commission of the Parliament believes he should
be charged with fraud, forgery, and abuse of office.
Mr Claes is immune from prosecution because he is a former Belgian
Government Minister. At the time of the alleged payment of kickbacks
from Agusta, an Italian helicopter manufacturer, he was his country's
Finance Minister.
Mr Claes is suspected of being party to the acceptance of a bribe of
more than #1m from Agusta in return for a contract for 48 army
helicopters.
The affair has rocked Belgian politics, causing four ministerial
resignations, the sensational suicide of a retired military chief, and
is suspected of being behind the murder of a prominent Liege socialist
politician who was gunned down, Mafia style, in a public car park.
Mr Claes, a popular figure in Belgium, went on to become his country's
respected Foreign Minister before being appointed to the Nato job after
the death of Manfred Woerner.
He said at first he had no part in the alleged payment by Agusta of
kickbacks to his party, the Belgian socialists, but later admitted he
had a ''vague memory'' of a ''donation'' being made although he had
nothing to do with it.
Mr Claes appeared at the hearing in Brussels after MPs questioned
former Defence Minister Guy Coeme, who has been linked to another
scandal involving payments to the Belgian socialists by a French firm.
Mr Coeme told reporters: ''I never had anything to do with fraud or
forgery and the word 'corruption' makes me sick.''
The commission was expected to continue its deliberations after Mr
Claes left, and to reconvene today.
Nato's ambassadors in Brussels have voiced public support for Mr Claes
although some have said privately that he should have resigned by now.
He has refused to go, saying earlier this week: ''I have never had
anything to do with things which are unacceptable and indefensible.''
Officials of Agusta have also denied any wrongdoing.

A JUDGE accepted yesterday that if he orders the widow of a smoker who
died of lung cancer to lodge up to #2m in court to safeguard the tobacco
company she is suing, her legal action might have to be abandoned.
Lord Gill decided to take time to think about his decision in the
action by Mrs Margaret McTear against Imperial Tobacco at the Court of
Session, the first case of its kind in the UK.
Her husband Alfred McTear died of lung cancer in March 1993 at the age
of 49. He had raised an action against Imperial, the manufacturers of
John Player cigarettes, which he had smoked for 30 years.
Mrs McTear took over the legal action but was refused legal aid and
her lawyers are now acting on a no-win no-fee basis.
If she loses the case, Imperial will be entitled to recover its legal
expenses, which could run to millions of pounds.
Since Mrs McTear has only a modest income, Imperial is faced with a
massive irrecoverable legal bill and has asked Lord Gill at the Court of
Session to order her to lodge up to #2m as security.
The company says that is what it will cost them just to investigate
the preliminary stage of the case.
Mr Colin McEachran QC, counsel for Mrs McTear, made it clear yesterday
that she had no external sources of finance.
Lord Gill said that if that was so, he would have to accept that the
probable if not inevitable result of granting the tobacco company's
motion for security would be to stop Mrs McTear's action in its tracks.
In effect, it would be an order to strike out her claim.
Mr McEachran argued that Mrs McTear had a constitutional right to
pursue her case and drew the court's attention to Article Six of the
European Convention on Human Rights which provided an entitlement to a
fair and public hearing in civil cases.
He said Mrs McTear should not suffer just because Imperial had chosen
to mount a very expensive defence.
Mr Derek Emslie QC, for the tobacco company, stressed that the
company's motive for seeking security was to protect itself against a
serious injustice -- incurring massive legal expenses which could not be
recovered from Mrs McTear.

Washington
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton will speak on US race relations and the
''obligations Americans have to each other'' in Texas on Monday as the
so-called ''Million Man March'' takes place in Washington.
In an oblique reference to the recent O J Simpson trial, which exposed
deep underlying racial differences in the United States, a White House
spokesman said Clinton wanted to seize the moment to try to help bridge
the gulf between blacks and whites.
''He is not planning on what I would describe as a major policy
address. This is really more a way to talk in a philosophical vein about
what obligations Americans have to each other,'' said spokesman Mike
McCurry.
He added: ''First and foremost, race relations in America are a matter
of the heart, about personal relations between individual Americans.
That's something that is not always a government responsibility.''
Clinton's address at the University of Texas will coincide with a
march of black men in Washington led by the controversial Rev Louis
Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam.
Although Farrakhan has played down positions seen as anti-Semitic and
racist in advance of Monday's march, he said in an interview released
today that any people, including Jews, Arabs, Koreans, and Vietnamese,
who earned money from the black community and gave nothing back were
''bloodsuckers''.
He also accused Jews of a racist history, saying: ''Jews were involved
in the slave trade. Jews held slaves in this country.''
''When we use the term bloodsucker, it doesn't just apply to some
members of the Jewish community,'' he said. ''That could apply to any
human being who does nothing for another but lays on that human being to
suck the value of its life without returning anything.
''Many of the Jews who owned the homes, the apartments in the black
community, we considered them bloodsuckers because they took from our
community and built their community but didn't offer anything back to
our community.
''And when the Jews left, the Palestinian Arabs came, Koreans came,
Vietnamese and other ethnic and racial groups came,'' he said. ''And so
this is a type and we call them bloodsuckers.''
The White House has denounced Farrakhan's ''repugnant'' views.
However, after first distancing itself from the march, it now says the
event could be a positive exercise by promoting the notion of personal
responsibility.
McCurry said the shift in tone should not be read ''as an endorsement
of anything Reverend Farrakhan has said'' and went on to condemn his
rhetoric as repugnant.
He said Clinton would call on Americans of every colour to spurn those
who advocate hatred and division.
Farrakhan is urging one million black men to converge on the nation's
capital to proclaim self-reliance in an event that would dwarf Martin
Luther King's famed civil rights march of 1963.
The event, drawing praise and criticism, is being promoted as a day of
atonement, prayer, and inspiration for black men. Women were told to
stay away and all blacks were asked to hold a ''day of absence'',
refraining from shopping or going to work or school.
Critics of the march condemn Farrakhan's involvement and his decision
to ask women to stay away. Farrakhan has said without elaboration that
he did not want women at the event ''because of the potential danger of
the situation''.--Reuter.

AN antique teddy bear owned by a Borders-based toy business was stolen
yesterday, only months after it was rescued with hundreds of other
teddies from a fire.
The 10-inch high bear called Jingles, used by Colour Box Miniatures to
promote its wares, was taken from a store display in Kingston upon
Thames, Surrey.
The couple who run the business, Mr Peter Fagan and his wife Frances,
have offered a reward for its recovery. The teddy has a bandage over its
head covering a missing right ear and left eye.
Only five months ago, hundreds of the couple's teddy bears were
damaged by smoke in a fire at their Berwick-upon-Tweed home.
Firefighters formed a human chain to rescue the bears.

ENERGETIC Baroness Thatcher showed little sign of slowing down
yesterday as she celebrated her 70th birthday with a pledge to carry on
working.
''Life comes one day at a time, not one year at a time,'' she said.
''The last 70 have done me well, so I might as well continue.''
The former Prime Minister spends most of her time making speaking
tours and promoting her books.
Asked if she treated birthdays as special, she said: ''Normally they
are just an extra birthday . . . Denis was 80 earlier in the year, so we
will be 70 and 80 -- and that is quite special.''
Lady Thatcher greeted reporters warmly, inviting them into her London
office -- but refused to pose for a birthday kiss with her husband.
The former Prime Minister said she had enjoyed listening to the
speakers at this week's Tory Party conference.
She said she had caught only a little of Mr Major's keynote speech at
the conference on the radio but said: ''I am sure it was terrific.''
Lady Thatcher said she phoned the BBC to thank them for playing
tributes to her from Mr Major, former US President George Bush, and
Nancy Reagan on the Today programme.

A CHURCH of Scotland minister has criticised ''flippancy'' over
references to the name of God.
The Rev Stanley Hood cited as an example TV pictures of a young
Manchester United fan with the words ''God Is Back'' painted on his face
-- a reference to the return of Eric Cantona.
Mr Hood, of Crown Court Church, in London's Covent Garden, said there
had been a recent trend of applying God's name to cult figures in the
entertainment field.
He voiced his concerns at a meeting of the English presbytery of the
Kirk, which endorsed his remarks.
Stressing that he did not wish to be a killjoy, he said he felt deeply
that he had to draw attention to such disrespect, describing it as
blasphemous.
That children were unaware of the seriousness of such flippancy
worried him.
Mr Hood said yesterday: ''In the Biblical concept, I would regard the
taking of God's name as blasphemous.''
He added: ''I think it is ignorance rather than malice, in that people
do not realise what blasphemy is.''
Mr Hood also criticised moves by the Government in its next Budget, in
which he feared cuts of 12% in overseas aid.
''This would affect the poorest people in the world, is totally wrong
and a matter of great Christian concern,'' he said.

Never throw anything away. Discover the pleasure to be had in
economising with style. That's the message from writers John and Irma
Mustoe. Here are just a few of their gardening tips
PLAN ahead on your vegetable planting. Choose varieties of vegetables
to suit your family. If they hate broad beans perhaps they'll like
French beans better. Plant vegetables that will fill the Hungry Gap as
well as your freezer. Do you know about sprout sprouts? All the books
condemn ''blown sprouts'', but if you ignore the books and let your
sprouts do just that, you will find an epicurean delight not unlike
asparagus, at just the Hungry Gap time of year. Let the sprout-sprouts
grow to about four or five inches long and then steam or lightly cook
them.
* THE best bird-scarer is free, bio-degradable and very, very quiet.
First, obtain a dead bird. Attach one leg to a branch with a piece of
string, letting the wings and head hang down to flap gently in the
breeze. Avoid chemical weedkillers and pesticides like the plague. Not
only are they potential people killers, they are exceedingly unkind to
your wallet. If a packet of seeds only cost 50p, which pay #4.50 to try
to save them from aphids? A little soap or detergent in a spray bottle
works. Salt makes a cheap and effective weed-killer for use on patios.
Just make up a strong solution and pour on the unwanted weeds. Try to do
this during a dry period, so that the salt has time to act before it is
diluted by rain. Remember that salt doesn't differentiate between weeds
and your treasured plants.
* SMALL plastic pots or deepish jar lids, filled with beer and sunk
into the ground to their rims, are excellent traps for slugs and snails
and do not endanger birds. Cover the tops with something -- a slate
rested on a stone or similar so that rain doesn't wash out the beer.
Empty out the dead drunkards every day or so and console yourself with
the thought that they were very, very happy. Alternatively, go out at
night snail-bashing.
* JAM jars or larger jars turned upside down over delicate plants make
a mini greenhouse. Even plastic bottles can be cut in half and shoved in
the ground to give plants a chance to grow before the slugs and snails
pig the lot.
* CORN-SALAD or lamb's lettuce is pretty, and thrives in the Hungry
Gap. Let it develop its seed heads which add delicious crunch to early
salads. For early salads, you can mix together your leftover vegetable
seeds such as lettuce, beetroot, spinach, parsley, or any other
edible-leaf ones, and plant in a row or block for cut-and-come-again, or
thinning and then letting, say, all the spinach that remains grow on to
maturity.
* IF you're cold in the garden, you aren't gardening hard enough. Find
work and gardening clothes at jumble sales. Ten pence for a sweater
means less agony if you shred it than if you shred your Guernsey.
* COLD tea really does make a good plant food -- indoors or out -- and
tea leaves make excellent food for roses especially. * IF you make
hanging baskets, rake or scrape moss from your lawn or path . . . there
always seems to be at least one damp, dank corner of a garden that
nurtures moss.
* SO simple: you can actually save soap by using it! Before you go out
gardening, scrape your nails along a bar of (recycled) soap, leaving no
room for dirt to collect.
0
* There are only two sorts of plant: the quick and the dead. If a
plant is malingering, it is a waste of space.
* GLOBE artichokes are delicious, and if you grow them yourself, they
are free. Even better, they multiply, and their progeny are just as
delicious. The plants are also attractive. Another gourmet crop to grow
oneself if there is possibly room is sweetcorn. The old saying is that
you can walk to the garden to cut sweetcorn but you must run back to the
kitchen to cook it, and if you ever taste really fresh corn you will
know it's true. This is the crop besides swede that really is greedy
about the room it takes, though, because you must plant it in a block,
not rows.
* SOFT fruit, and indeed tree fruit, will save you hundreds of pounds
over just a very few years. Grow your favourites, and consider yourself
lucky if you have pears, cherries and quinces in your garden.
* HORSERADISH will take over the world. So will mint. Perpetual
spinach is a must. Grow a few plants of summer spinach if you like
watching things bolt, but perpetual spinach will give you delicious beds
for marinated chicken, generous quantities of puree on which to spread a
strip of sorrel puree for a superb starter, and bowl after bowl of fresh
salad.
* MARROWS are another crop that varies according to when you harvest
it -- small courgettes, satisfying marrows, and if you can bear to forgo
some of the fruit, the flowers can be cooked in batter, but this is
rather like eating baby corncobs -- why not wait until it grows up and
gives you more?
* A GARDEN without herbs is truly a garden without spice. Even the
cheapest, meanest, most parsimonious meal can be lifted to gourmet
tastes with the addition of some home-grown herbs. Try some of the ones
that don't package well, such as lovage, parsley, rosemary, lemon thyme,
tansy. When you have your own sage plants you'll never want the dry,
powdery, tasteless stuff in jars again. Toss a branch of rosemary or
sage or even lavender onto the barbecue grill and sit back and wait for
the compliments.
* A FINE lawn is a splendid thing, but it is expensive in time and
money. It needs feeding and weeding and careful mowing and watering. A
good, serviceable lawn can be much cheaper and less work. Moss can be
controlled to some extent by letting the grass grow longer, and if
daisies cost #5 a dozen we would pay a fortune to grow these charming
little flowers in our lawns.
* YOU can make all kinds of gardening tools for yourself -- an old
piece of angle iron can easily bemade into a ''gadunger'' for plunging
into the ground beside a deep-rooted piece of unwanted plant life.
* BEFORE paying for manure from a stable for farmyard, ask around.
Many stables will be grateful if you just take it away.
* MOST garden machinery is bought by people who need it so that they
can get through their gardening chores quickly, leaving them time to go
down to the squash club to get the exercise they would have got if they
had not used the garden machinery.
A rotavator is a mechanical device for chopping up weeds and
distributing the pieces evenly around the garden in freshly-turned soil
where they will prosper. Power mowers may need servicing from time to
time by a professional. Most of us wait until our mower does not start
in the spring before we send it in to be repaired, and the laws of
supply and demand mean that the price of repairs at that time are at the
maximum, and you will have to wait for the work to be done. The same
job, done in the autumn, will be cheaper, and you are in no hurry to get
the machine back.
* IF pests are eating your flowers or vegetables, heave on more
manure. This will strengthen the plant and help it fight off the pest,
and, even if that fails, there will be enough of the plant for you and
for the pest.
* ANOTHER way of clearing land to prepare it for planting is to cover
it with a sheet of black plastic. Weigh the plastic down with stones and
leave over winter. This will not kill the seeds.
* WHEN you do have a little sunshine on your seedlings, newspaper
makes a good sunshade. Newspapers can be added to the compost heap, but
you should shred them first. They are the last things to rot down, so
you don't want a high percentage in the heap.
* ALL of these tips and more for slashing your daily living expenses
are from The Penny Pincher's Book -- Easy Ways of Living Better for
Less. Written by John and Irma Mustoe and published by Souvenir Press,
it retails for #4.99.

A MAN who forced a supermarket chain to set up a discount card scheme
in a #250,000 blackmail bid was jailed yesterday for eight years.
Frank Riolfo claimed he had Aids and threatened to contaminate food at
Tesco unless the supermarket piloted a scheme -- similar to its
subsequent Club Card promotion -- at its Dudley store in the west
Midlands.
The cards were to carry details, in a magnetic strip, of a bank
account from which Riolfo would withdraw the cash, and Tesco was to
inform him of the PIN number by placing a coded advert in a national
newspaper.
Hundreds of the cards were handed out to unwitting shoppers and
Riolfo, a 50-year-old salesman, managed to obtain #7000. However, his
scam ended with his arrest at a cashpoint machine, Northampton Crown
Court was told.
Mrs Joan Butler, prosecuting, said that on January 13 this year, the
manager of a Tesco store in Kettering, Northamptonshire, received a call
from a man calling himself St Mary-Ann.
The caller said he had contaminated food at the store and an immediate
search revealed a pack of frozen peas and butterfly prawns had been
injected with black ink.
Three days later, Riolfo, alias St Mary-Ann, sent a blackmail demand
to Tesco's head office in Cheshunt, Hertforshire. It referred to the
Kettering contamination and added: ''As you know by now, the food was
contaminated with pen ink. It could so easily have been a toxic
substance. I am fully prepared to extend my actions unless my demands
are met.''
To get the card's PIN number, he told Tesco to insert the number after
coded entries in the personal announcements of The Times.
One entry was to read ''Give Blessing to St Mary-Ann'' and another
said: ''Thanks for the wonderful time last night. Ring me, Love Mick.''
At first, Tesco refused to go along with the scheme and Riolfo, of
Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, injected frozen meat at the Dudley store,
deliberately leaving behind the syringe.
His letters also became more and more threatening and he told Tesco he
would inform the national press.
In one letter, he said: ''I have Aids. So I have a ready made supply
of infected blood.''
On February 27, Tesco opened a Barclays Bank account, depositing
#25,000, and, in line with Riolfo's request, launched the Club Card
promotion at its Dudley store on March 1.
One of the first of the 500 people through the door was Riolfo's
52-year-old wife Valerie. She walked nervously around the store before
picking up her card, registering with her real name and address -- a
clue which helped police track down Riolfo.
The couple, who married in 1962, toured the country withdrawing money
at random at cashpoints across the Midlands. Riolfo said he would stop
after he had withdrawn #250,000.
On April 22, they were arrested at a cashpoint in Slough, Berkshire.
His wife denied the offences and the charges against her were
dismissed.

CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington was granted an interim interdict last
night, preventing Clydesdale district's environmental health officials
from test sampling at his farm.
After a marathon sitting of Lanark Sheriff Court, Mr Errington
commented: ''The sheriff said this was tantamount to harrassment.
''He said the case had to be considered against the background of the
current court case between myself and Clydesdale.''
The court heard there were 87 batches of cheese stored at Walston
Braehead, near Dunsyre, Lanarkshire.
Mr Errington had them tested at an accredited laboratory and there was
no trace of listeria. The result certificates were with the council.
The writ states that 4519kg of the cheese had been sold so far this
year and no cases of illness had been reported.
The council threatened to test sample every batch of cheese in store
on September 15 and have them tested in England and at the Scottish
Agricultural College. However, this was not carried out.
The writ says that, next Tuesday, Mr Errington will not be able to be
at the farm to supervise samples.
One of the cheesemakers will also be absent and Mr Errington could not
guarantee his advisors would be present during testing.
The mass sampling would mean the factory would be disrupted and a
day's production lost. Mr Errington suggests the following week would be
more suitable.
The writ also claims the council is being unreasonable in demanding
the 87 cheeses be tested, particularly as the council refuses to confirm
it will pay for the cheeses, valued at a minimum of #2300.
Mr Errington is already involved in a legal battle with Clydesdale
over five tonnes of 1994 cheese impounded and frozen at his farm.

FOODWATCH
Catherine Brown turns judge for a national tasting competition and
leaves with a cheesy grin on her face
ONE OF the hazards of food writing are the invitations to judge
controversial tasting competitions when one person's gastro-delight
turns out to be another's gastro-disaster. They needed another Scottish
judge for the British Cheese Awards at Cabot Hall in London's revamped
docklands. I accepted.
There would be around 400 cheeses, ranging from hi-tech factory
Cheddars to handmade fresh young cheeses. I arrived, breakfastless, from
the overnight sleeper, ready for a hard day's tasting.
If the British Cheese Awards have a purpose, other than celebrating
the best cheeses, it is to bring together people from opposite camps in
the UK cheese world with the aim of improving the quality of
British-made cheese. It is not just about those making ''special''
cheeses by hand for discerning gourmets using milk from their own cows
in a farmhouse creamery. It is also about cheese made by people pressing
buttons in creameries, where a continuous cheesemaking process turns out
tons of factory cheese a day.
They are two opposing camps -- factory and farmhouse -- yet they have
a common aim: to make the best cheese for the right purpose. While the
cheese awards are intended to provide encouragement for the small
specialists, who have battled (and like Humphry Errington with his
Lanark Blue continue to battle) against a system which has often impeded
their development, they are also for those who run multi-million-pound
cheese plants. Occasionally tensions surfaced.
A judge was critical of the standard of English territorial cheeses.
An issue which was taken up by Scottish judge, Iain Mellis, cheeesmaker
turned cheesemonger, who accused the factories of being responsible for
the decline.
''They are destroying the territorials,'' he said, ''by their
disregard for original recipes.
''The correct recipes for Lancashires, Wensleydales, Cheshires and
Caerphillys, have been ignored by the factories who have made a standard
'territorial' cheese which resembles them all. When orders come in, the
appropriate label is attached to the cheese,'' he says.
It's an attack on the factory system which Mellis makes from his own
experience as a factory cheesemaker.
Another judge and specialist cheesemaker, Mary Holbrooke from Wales,
claims that supermarket requirements have changed the Stilton recipe and
altered the flavour by making an edge-to-edge pretty blue-veined design,
when the original veining was only around the centre of the cheese. They
are turning it into a type of Danish Blue, she says. There used to be
cheese flavour in the part round the edge which was free from mould.
No-one from the factory camp defends, but the spokesman from Tesco,
who sponsored the awards, accepts these criticisms and promises to take
up the issues with their factory suppliers.
The tasting took up the best part of the day and we worked in pairs:
cheese expert with the technical know-how, plus food writer or
professional cook as critical-consumer. My first co-judge was Scott
Lyall, a cheesemaker involved in marketing pre-prepared factory-made
cheese. Not for us, however, the delicate little soft cheeses in novel
shapes, but two tables laden with 10 kilogram blocks of mature cheddar.
Thirty of them to be nosed, worked like plasticine to judge the texture,
nosed again, then tasted.
Between drinks of water and refreshing bites into a cox's pippen, the
good, the bad, and the indifferent are uncovered.
During which time Lyall reveals some factory techniques which are
clearly not in the best interests of making good cheese.
The cheese is too moist, he says, they've probably added enzymes to
force the flavour. There's a chalkiness in the taste. Some skimmed milk
powder, he believes, has been added.
We agree most of the time on the cheese ratings, though sometimes he
describes a cheese as ''too farmhousey''. What he means is too
''fruity'', too acidic. I think the sharpness gives it character.
For my second judging stint, my partner is Iain Mellis, who has just
added a new shop ''Selling and Ripening Cheese'' in Glasgow to his
successful Edinburgh operation.(So many Glasgow people, he says were
visiting Edinburgh to buy his cheese.) Our task is to judge the Best
Scottish Cheese, but Mellis is disappointed at the standard and thinks
we are at a disadvantage because of distance and the deterioration
during transportation.
The final consensus is to give the award to a factory block mature
cheddar from Lockerbie which has survived the journey better than the
others. The technical quality of the competing farmhouse cheeses does
not match it.
Mellis says that if our farmhouses could learn some of the better
techniques from our factories, and if factories could learn from
farmhouses about how to produce a better flavour, we might make more
British cheese better able to hold its own against the competition from
the rest of Europe.

A PERSONAL aspect of the speech -- when the Prime Minister, visibly
moved, spoke of sneering remarks about the garden ornaments business his
father ran 40 years ago -- touched the conference.
Mr Major said: ''When I was a small boy, my bread and butter was paid
for by my father's small business.
''He made garden ornaments 40 years ago, and some fashionable people
find that very funny.
''I don't. I see the proud, stubborn, independent old man who ran that
firm and taught me to love my country, fight for my own and spit in the
eye of malign fate.
''I know the knockers and sneerers who may never have taken a risk in
their comfortable lives aren't fit to wipe the boots of the risk-takers
of Britain.
''When my father's business failed -- because his health failed -- I
saw the price the small businessman may have to pay.
''I know the sacrifice they make for the dreams they have.
''They don't know whether they'll succeed. But they work as hard as
they can.
''That's why, as (Board of Trade President) Ian Lang told you, we've
set up the biggest consultation with business ever seen in this country
-- to find out what more we can credibly do to help them. Frankly, I
think they're heroes.''

Vienna, Friday
FAILURE by 42 governments to agree international curbs on the use of
land mines provoked outrage today among humanitarian groups and
anti-mine campaigners who blasted the deadlock as shameful and
grotesque.
Activists, backed by such groups as the International Save The
Children Alliance, announced plans for a black-list of firms who
produced mines or their components, some of them big names in the United
States and the European Union, to encourage a consumer boycott.
After three weeks of wrangling at a UN-sponsored conference, delegates
conceded yesterday that they could not agree on limiting the use of
anti-personnel mines, which kill or maim more than 20,000 civilians
every year, many of them children.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which groups
hundreds of organisations from around the world, said work would start
to single out firms involved in mine production, many of which also
manufacture consumer goods.
ICBL co-ordinator Jody Williams said there had been 1600 mine blast
victims since the conference began on September 25.
''We will go after them, all the companies that are involved in mines
production,'' said Carl von Essen, of the International Save the
Children Alliance.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>New policies unveiled as party is given a call to arms for the fight against Labour. Major goes for 'the win of our lives'</HEADLINE>

JOHN MAJOR yesterday sent the party faithful away from the conference
in Blackpool with a rousing call to arms for the fight ahead, and
telling them they were on the way to a fifth General Election win.
He weighed into Labour and unveiled a package of populist policies
designed to show that the Government still had fresh ideas.
The Prime Minister announced:
* A #120m crusade against crime with 5000 extra police on the streets
and 10,000 extra cameras in public places.
* Plans for a new FBI-style national squad, backed by MI5, charged
with fighting organised crime and drug-dealing
* A doubling to 70,000 pupils of the assisted places scheme Labour
last week pledged to scrap and new freedoms for schools to run their own
affairs
* Tax and spending cuts when possible with the ultimate aim of
abolishing capital gains and inheritance tax
* An absolute refusal by any Conservative Government to sign up for a
federal European superstate.
The Prime Minister -- after recalling his resignation as leader of the
party in June and the leadership election that followed -- said:
''Today, we meet united, healed, renewed -- and thirsting for the real
fight: with Labour
''We're going to mount the fight of our lives and when the time comes,
we're going to deliver the win of our lives.''
Mr Major accused Labour leader Tony Blair of having changed his
politics, his principles and his philosophy.
Taxation
Announcing his crusade to turn Britain into ''the Enterprise Centre of
Europe'', Mr Major said: ''We Tories often talk of business and the need
for success. It's worth remembering why. It's quite simple. If business
makes profit, it provides jobs and pays taxes.''
The Prime Minister said people with jobs paid taxes too and taxes paid
for teachers, nurses and public services.
He said that high spending and high taxes are no longer an option. The
state spends too much of our national wealth. We must get that share
below 40% and keep it there.
''And -- be in no doubt -- I don't only mean income tax.''
Mr Major said: ''I mean the taxes that damage investment and stultify
wealth creation. I mean inheritance tax. I mean capital gains tax.
''We must cut them, and then -- when affordable -- we should abolish
them.
Benefits
Turning to welfare spending, he said providing quality care for those
most in need was a strong part of the Tory tradition.
''But because we live longer, we need to develop similar approaches to
long term-care -- encourage new forms of savings, new kinds of
insurance, more flexible use of pensions.
''That's the next step forward in our welfare system, and one we are
examining right now.''
Mr Major told the conference: ''From next autumn, everyone who is
unemployed will need to undertake a contract for work, a contract that
makes it absolutely clear that they have obligations to accept paid work
when it is available.''
He added: ''We'll continue to shape a welfare system that is generous
to those in need. We can do no other.''
Scotland
Turning to the constitution, Mr Major said the party recognised that
Scotland and Wales were nations in their own right: ''Of course, if they
insist, they could ultimately go their own way. We could not properly
stop them.''
The Government was, he said, ''sensitive'' to people's concerns in
Scotland: ''So we are looking at more ways of giving people more say
over decisions affecting their day-to-day lives.''
However, it was his ''duty'' to warn about Labour's plans for the
constitution. He said Labour were proposing constitutional change for
their own ''party political advantage''.
In Scotland, they were ''running scared'' of the Scottish National
Party, hence proposals for a tax-raising parliament in their first year,
but were less concerned aobut Plaid Cymru in Wales, hence just an
assembly there.
In England, he said, Labour could not make up their mind, so they
might, or might not, impose regional assemblies, for which there was no
demand.
''Labour only promise them in an attempt which fails to justify the
over-representation of Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster. It is
straightforward gerrymandering and we might as well say so.''
Mr Major said a tax-raising parliament in Scotland would see Scots
paying higher income tax on the same income than people in England,
Wales or Northern Ireland.
To start with, there would be a ''tartan tax'' of an extra #6 a week
for the average family, and investors would avoid Scotland where they
would have to pay higher wages to compensate for higher taxes.
''The tartan tax will do two things: it will pay for more bureaucrats
and more politicians, and it will begin the decline of Scottish
prosperity.
''Neither of them are in the interests of Scotland.''
He confessed opinion polls showed Scots were not ''fond'' of the
Government at the moment: ''But I'm fond of them and they are being
deceived by Labour.
''Labour's plans are an immediate threat to Scotland and a threat to
the United Kingdom.
''We will continue to look for ways to improve the government of
Scotland. That is our duty. But we will resist these damaging plans with
all our strength.
Mr Major said, in concluding his speech: ''Our message to our fellow
countrymen is clear. Millions have still to make up their minds.
''The choice is theirs. Our nation's future is at stake. And we stand
ready to serve.''

MY LAST GOOD PLAY
Fred McAuley -- comedian
* THE last good play I saw was The Salt Wound by 7:84 company at the
Edinburgh Festival this year. It's set in a fishing village somewhere in
Europe, but the accents in the play are obviously Scottish and, really,
it's the story of a family disaster within a fishing community.
Basically, there's the husband who is a fisherman and the son who has
been encouraged not to go to sea and therefore works in a bank. However,
after the son gets married he decides to go to sea, much against the
wishes of his mother, who rails against village tradition in wanting to
keep her son at home on land. And, of course, there's a tragedy. I
believe the play was written for Scottish actresses in their more mature
years, and I can certainly say the principals were superb.

Phil Penfold meets Frances Barber shortly before she leaves for Africa
and a part in a new period drama about one of the greatest political
manipulators of the country's history
WE ARE sitting in a rather chilly caravan trailer on a damp film set
in Tooting. It is drizzling outside, and Frances Barber is pulling the
last few hairpins from her hair. ''I have never ever,'' she declares,
''been interviewed in my pyjamas before . . . it's a first for me.''
She's in full costume for the next scene in the BBC's Film on One
drama, It Could Be You, in which she stars with heart-throb actor
Douglas Hodge, who plays her husband, an ordinary bloke who just happens
to win #25m on a lottery ticket. Trouble is, it's the husband's mistress
who actually placed the bet!
The pyjamas that Barber is sporting (underneath a warm dark-grey
woollie) make her look, she says, a little bit like Andy Pandy, and, she
admits: ''They are not really the sort of thing that I'd even be seen in
at home.'' Still, on this rather unglamorous location, they do keep the
impossibly gorgeous Barber nice and warm.
It's been a ''very busy and -- touch wood -- pretty successful year''
for Barber. She's made a couple of movies, starred in the West End in
Insignificance -- in which she played Marilyn Monroe -- and now comes It
Could Be You, which will be aired in a primetime weekend slot by BBC1 in
the late autumn. She is also flying out to South Africa on Monday to
play the leading lady opposite Martin Shaw in the BBC's new period drama
series Rhodes, which is about the life of Victorian pioneer, statesman,
and political manipulator Cecil Rhodes.
Barber thinks she is the only woman in the film. ''There are 6000
Zulus, about three dozen male actors -- and me! It will either be
totally wonderful or an endurance test,'' she sighs. ''No, only kidding
-- I'm really looking forward to it, because my role is such a
fascinating part. I'm going to be the rather strange Princess Radziwill,
who genuinely did exist, and who ended up in jail for forging Rhodes's
signature on hotel bills and all manner of chits. She'd just sign for
her bills, like the rich do, and never pay anything.
''I find her very intriguing, because she must have known that Rhodes
was gay, and yet she still chased him. She was obsessed with him --
completely. It's a bit like Fatal Attraction without the sex scenes. Or
the rabbit. She'd stand outside his house, clamouring for attention, and
from what I learned from the research I've done, she partly contributed
to the poor man's death. He just wanted her out of his hair and she was
a constant source of worry to him. I've had to learn how to do a good
strong Eastern European accent for her, and I think I've got it off OK,
because I've had wonderful help from the voice coach Joan Washington,
who's always been a talisman when I've attempted different voices.
Joan's marvellous, a bit like a female Henry Higgins when it comes to
linguistics.''
Barber believes you could not get two people further apart than the
adventurer princess and the housewife in It Could Be You. Wendy is very
ordinary, with a rather dull man she's married to and a teenage son.
Life only gets jolted out of the ordinary when her old man wins the
jackpot, and they manage to lose the ticket.
Actually, she admits, she rather likes Wendy, because she's a trier.
''She really does work damn hard to keep her little family together.
And, like a lot of real-life women whose men aren't bringing the money
in or whose blokes are bringing in less than they do, it's the woman who
has the hardest part of it. Life is a struggle for her, there's not a
shred of doubt about that.
''She works as a supervisor in Safeway's, and we had to film a lot of
scenes down at the local Balham branch, with me in full uniform. The
store must be very pleased at the publicity they'll be getting. Anyway,
I'm standing there one day, with the costume on, surrounded by
microphones and cameras and crew, and this little old lady waltzes up to
me and says 'where do I get a trolley from, then?'
''I hadn't the faintest idea, and I told her so.
''She was furious. She said, 'Call yourself a supervisor? You work
here and you don't know where things are? I shall report you to the
management!' and she stormed off. I must have looked pretty good,
because time after time real-life punters were coming up and asking me
where the cheese counter was. It's curious, isn't it, that they never
seem to notice all the paraphernalia around you!''
It didn't take a lot of extra coaching for Frances to play a store
worker because early on, when she was starting out as an actress, she
used to earn a few pennies by working at Woolworths and Marks &amp; Spencer
in Wolverhampton. ''I know what it's like from the other side of the
check-out,'' she says. ''I was one of those many thousands of Saturday
girls, and the nice thing is that they now have a picture of me on the
wall of one of the staff rooms where I worked.''
Barber is a fearless actress, both on film and stage. She first made
her name with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the mid-eighties as a
sensationally passionate Camille in Pam Gems's play of the same name.
She has gone on to play a series of sexpot roles in everything from
Peter Greenaway movies to Dennis Potter plays on TV, as well as bringing
her undoubted sexuality to the classics at the RSC and the Royal
National Theatre. Stunning to look at -- the face is a perfect heart,
the long glossy hair is brunette, the lips are carmine, and the husky
voice is nicotine-scarred, she looks the archetypal actress, although
she is actually a bookmaker's daughter from the Black Country, the
fourth of six children, born and bred in a council house. She is the
first and only member of her family to receive a university education.
The wonderful thing about her brilliant career today is she now feels
she has got to a stage -- in her mid-thirties -- where she seems to get
cast in all sorts of different roles. And she loves it. There might be
roles that she couldn't play, but she genuinely thinks she'd have a go
at anything if the script interested her. ''I mean, who would have seen
me as Marilyn Monroe? But there I was at the Donman Warehouse, in a
blonde wig, doing my best.
''I must have done all right, because on the last performance the
stage manager came round and said, 'Frances, Dustin Hoffman has been in
the audience, and he wants to come and say hello'. So I thought that
this was a finale hoax -- a joke -- and said, 'Oh yeah, that's nice . .
. pull the other one'.''
''And then there's a knock on the door, and in he walks, raving about
the show and being so complimentary that it was embarrassing.
''Sadly, he didn't offer me a role in anything. Yet . . . But he's mad
keen on theatre, and he does come across to perform in the West End from
time to time. I'd love to appear in a play with him. Meeting one's idols
is always so interesting.''
She adds: ''Acting is a strange old game, because you go from that, to
playing Mrs South London Normal. Do I do the lottery myself? Not until
we started shooting Nigel Williams's scrip, I didn't. Now Douglas and I
and Jim Carter and a few others in the cast do a lottery line each week,
all based on birthdays and house numbers, just like everyone else. And
no, we haven't won a penny. I've really no idea about what on earth I'd
do if we did.
''That's what It Could Be You is really all about . . . pointing out
how too much money and the love of it is evil and corrupting, and that
it motivates so many other feelings. Look what happens to real-life
winners. Their lives just turn upside-down and everyone goes bananas.
All I ever seem to hear about is the greed -- I keep reading terrible
stories.
''The nicest person in the play is the son, because he has his head
screwed on and tells his parents that money isn't the most important
thing in the world. It's strange, isn't it, that there are so many
indications at the moment that the kids are teaching the adults how to
behave, and what a moral code is. Look at the daughter in AbFab.''
Next up -- after Rhodes -- comes ''a project with Ruby Wax that we're
still talking about. I'm a great admirer of her work and sense of
humour. She asked me round to her house to let me have a go in her
flotation tank, which she finds very useful in relieving stress and the
rest. I came out with a hump, because I couldn't bear it. It was awful,
all saline and in the dark. I was worse after it than before.''

CAPE TOWN: The South African Government has ordered legal action to
recover two luxury cars and a cellular telephone issued to Winnie
Mandela, estranged wife of President Nelson Mandela, while she served as
a deputy minister. Mrs Mandela, 60, who is being sued by her 77-year-old
husband for divorce, was sacked in March after defying a presidential
instruction to cancel a foreign trip.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth made it clear yesterday that he had
the West of Scotland firmly in his sights when he said he wants to
double the number of pupils on the controversial scheme which gives less
well-off families financial assistance towards the cost of their
children's private schooling.
The independent sector reacted with delight to the expansion of the
assisted places scheme -- which formed a major part of the Prime
Minister's conference speech yesterday. It could cost the taxpayer about
#21m a year.
At present, 3050 pupils attend private secondary schools in Scotland
under the scheme, at a cost of about #10.5m a year from the public
purse.
The sector said demand for places could not be met because of
Government limits on the amount it was prepared to spend on the
initiative, but cautioned against an ''overnight'' doubling in numbers.
However, Labour reacted angrily to the planned expansion, which will
also take place in England.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said last night: ''It is a
scandalous use of resources when the whole education system is crying
out for money. We will abolish the scheme.''
However, Mr Forsyth said it helped more than 3000 children whose
parents would otherwise be unable to send their children to private
school.
Speaking after Mr Major's speech, he said: ''These are not privileged
families in any sense.'' Mr Forsyth pointed out that about 19% of pupils
at independent schools in Edinburgh were on assisted places, 2% higher
than the Scottish average.
''In the West of Scotland, the scheme is not so strong and that is
what we want to put right,'' he said.
Mr Frank Gerstenberg, principal of George Watson's College in
Edinburgh, which has more than 2000 pupils, said he was delighted about
the expansion.
He said: ''The great benefit for pupils on the scheme is that it gives
them the opportunity to come to a school where they can have their full
potential realised.
''From the school's point of view, the great advantage is that it
gives a far greater social mix, which I am very much in favour of.''
George Watson's has 17.5% of its pupils on assisted places but Mr
Gerstenberg said he would not want to double the proportion, partly for
financial reasons.
To control costs, the Government has set a 3% limit on the fee
increases private schools can charge, but actual increases have been
rising at about 4%, which has meant schools meeting the cost of the
difference.
Mr Gerstenberg said that, at George Watson's, it amounted to about #72
for each pupil each year.
He said: ''I think the expansion is a very cunning ploy by the Prime
Minister to lay down the gauntlet to Labour and challenge it to run the
risk of parental and school anger if it goes for abolition.''
Mr Forsyth recognised that a number of schools might have limited
scope to take more assisted pupils and said he would consult the
Scottish Council of Independent Schools about the expansion.
Its director, Mrs Judith Sischy, said: ''We would like the scheme to
be more widely known and to look at the income scale to establish if it
can be more generous.
''Parents at the middle and top of the scale have to make a
considerable contribution. There is no support for boarding fees but we
wonder if boarders from low-income families could be assisted.''
Assistance is given on an income-related scale, with parents earning
less than #9450 having the entire fees paid. Nearly 50% of beneficiaries
fall into this category.
Although there is no top end to the scale there is a natural cut-off
point for rising parental contributions because secondary day fees
average about #3500 a year.
Mr Robertson said Labour in Scotland would look at spending the money
which goes on assisted places on state nursery provision.

SOFTWARE
The Victorians used a long bit of wood to see in 3-D but Joe Donnelly
explains, a young Glasgow firm is taking technology a few light years
further and giving real depth to the way we see ourselves
A SCOTTISH software company has developed a program that lets
computers process information the way a human brain does. That might not
sound like a great achievement, because most people believe computers
are simply electronic brains, but it is a huge advance with enormous
commercial potential.
The Turing Institute is an independent software firm in Glasgow's West
End specialising in the research, development, and commercial
exploitation of advanced software technology. And while they are at the
razor-sharp edge of information technology, their development stems from
an old technology developed in Victorian Britain.
Three-dimensional photography was very big with the Victorians, in the
absence of cinema, television, and video. They took two pictures of a
scene and printed them side by side, inserted them into a viewer made of
wood, which enabled them to see the view in three dimensions. This was
the apotheosis of all home entertainment at the time. Queen Victoria
herself popularised it after peering into the contraption at the Empire
Exhibition in London.
A hundred years later, technical improvements only involved green and
red plastic-lensed specs to watch 3-D movies such as Jaws. However, the
technology remained virtually unchanged because the two side-by-side
photos let the brain do all the work of ''stereopsis'' which takes a two
dimensional picture and converts it by sheer computational power into
three dimensions, giving it depth as well as height and width.
Dr Peter Mowforth, of the Turing Institute, said: ''We have got a
computer to do stereopsis, virtually seeing the world the way we do.
Because humans are very visual creatures, a huge amount of brain power
is used just making sense of the world around us, converting signals
into pictures.
''While people may have obvious differences in intelligence, even the
village idiot's brain works out these vast calculations just to see
what's going on around him. To reproduce his visual skills would cost 10
times more than it cost to put a man on the moon. Getting a computer to
do this was a very complex problem.
''Our staff have been working on this issue for 10 years. Now we have
solved the question of stereopsis and are finding ways of using it to
tackle other problems.''
The Turing team's success, a collaboration with the University of
Glasgow Dental School, uses multiple cameras to take a set of pictures
of an object which is then digitised and put into the computer's C3D
program. It then translates the image into a picture with real depth.
For instance, a photograph of Dr Mowforth taken from the front
appears, almost by alchemy, on the screen in profile and can be turned
in any direction by the use of the cursor. A glance at his profile shows
the program has got the shape exactly right.
The dental school's involvement is easy to understand. Dr Mowforth
says the 3-D model is accurate to a fraction of a millimetre, which
means that it can record any object put through the system. The school,
by legal requirement, stores thousands of plaster casts of tooth
impressions, and must keep then for up to 25 years. Over a period, this
builds up to many tons of plaster.
The C3D program, Mowforth tells us, could simply take a picture of the
cast and it would be available for inspection, as visual as the real
thing, at any time. Since many images can be stored on a disk, it could
solve storage and retrieval problems, and of course, none of the models
would wear, or break, or get lost.
''If you can take a picture, then you can make three dimensional
models,'' Dr Mowforth says, and goes on to prove it in a fascinating
demonstration of visual imaging that is certain to have huge commercial
ramifications. An American company wanted 3-D models made of a specific
location on earth. A satellite took a picture of a valley called Irish
Canyon in Colorado. The Turing Institute put the photos through the
program.
On screen, the canyon can be seen from earth level, and the computer
can take a viewer on a high-speed simulated flight through its twists
and turns which are reproduced with uncanny accuracy in three
dimensions. The implications for flight simulation over any terrain on
earth, for map making, and for computer-game landscapes, are phenomenal.
There are other potential commercial and academic applications. In
London's maritime museum, where thousands of drawings of ships hulls are
stored on paper, they could be digitised and shown as real images of
ships themselves.
In other museums, where most of the collections are in storage, rather
than on display, the C3D program could be used to archive the national
treasures, especially sculptures and fossils, and have them easily
accessible on computer screens.
The system can be adapted for scanning electron microscopes that can
take pictures on the atomic and molecular and cellular level. Using the
Turing Institute process, scientists would be able to make three
dimensional models of minute particles and biological components. It
might be possible to get the first real and accurate model of the double
helix of the DNA in the human chromosome.
On a less high-tek note, the system could also be used to make the
past come alive, in a manner of speaking. BBC in London have discovered
a number of the old Victorian stereo pictures of scenes around Britain
and are hoping to use them to recreate some of the past.
Dr Mowforth says: ''We will try to recreate a virtual Victorian
Britain. There were hundreds of thousands of these old pictures taken
last century, and there are probably many still in existence. Using our
program we would be able to virtually recreate, in three dimensions,
places and buildings and landscapes that no longer exist, and we could
also do the same with some of the old Victorians who appeared in them
and have long since died.
''Another benefit to television drama is that while, at the moment,
they use old photographs as backdrops on sets of period productions,
they always look two dimensional, just like photographs. Using the
computer stereo system would make the scenes look much more real . . .
and, of course, they would be a lot cheaper too.''

IT WAS certainly Alamein rather than Dunkirk for the Tories yesterday.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Major will turn out to be Rommel or
Montgomery, but his best-ever conference speech signalled that it will
certainly be a hell of a battle.
The harsh realities of the party's financial situation were brought
home by donation forms being over-optimistically left on the press
tables.
A suitably traditional jazz band in straw boaters were about the only
sign of a shift to the left by the party during the week, although
home-grown music was not entirely bashed aside. The organist played Oh I
Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside while the collection was being taken.
Union Jacks were handed out for waving, a few brave pro-Europeans with
EU flags found Portillo-ite free zones and prepared to wave there. In a
masterly compromise which the Prime Minister would surely have approved,
one lady stuck her smaller EU flag on to her Union Jack neatly
symbolising party policy.
However, while one man walked around draped in the Union Jack, no-one
was foolhardy enough to appear clad in the gold and blue of Europe.
The Tories do not copy Labour's strange practice -- a tradition Mr
Blair has not got round to abolishing -- of a vote of thanks to the
media, an event of harrowing insincerity occasionally relieved by
humour. Instead, like Labour for the rest of its conference, they just
attack us.
Mrs Alison McNair, prospective candidate for Bath, broke off her
financial appeal to admonish us ''Stop reporting what you wanted to see
and start reporting what you did see.''
Even Mr Major had a brief go at the BBC's Today programme, this year's
clear winner in the Tory hate stakes.
The filmmakers had completed a quick compilation of conference
highlights set to more uplifting or, at any rate, deafening music, which
was rather like watching the trailer of a not very good film you have
already seen.
Mr Portillo was in but his clip did not feature any of his best
Euro-bashing moments. Mr Heseltine was effectively the winner, his
left-right jig along the platform winning another burst of applause even
on film.
The Prime Minister first had to deal with the fact that he was making
his speech on Friday the 13th which superstitious representatives might
have found ominous. However, he had the perfect charm to exorcise such
fear. It is Lady Thatcher's birthday he reminded them, ''and she won
three elections in a row so the omens are good''. So that was all right.
Mr Major found, as many a competitor has before him, that against a
class opponent you have to lift your game or lose.
The strategy of the speech, as opposed to its detail, was to put clear
blue water between Tories and their opponents and, in that, he has
probably succeeded.
Humphrey, the Downing Street cat, whose adventure probably guarantees
him a guest-star spot in top Tory speeches for a while, got a mention.
Mr Blair was accused of changing everything except his name.
Without suggesting that Mr Major's most passionate speech yet did not
operate on genuine emotion, it struck a deeper, personal note when he
rounded on those who have poked fun at his father's garden ornaments
small business of 40 years ago. It had clearly and rightly angered Mr
Major, as much as hurt him, and his father would have been proud of his
son's tribute.
He swung the Cabinet solidly behind Mr Howard's penal proposals,
perhaps reckoning that a row with the judiciary could turn out a plus
rather than a minus.
The defence of the Union fires up Mr Major more than most political
issues, and he tore into Labour's devolution policy in apocalyptic style
which must have delighted Mr Michael Forsyth nodding agreement on the
platform.
The Scots, Mr Major acknowledged, do not currently have much time for
the Conservative Party, but he remained fond of the Scots and pleaded
with them to recognise ''You are being deceived by the Labour Party.''
Scotland was the only area where the Prime Minister admitted the
Tories' appalling plight in the opinion polls, but right at the end he
claimed that millions of voters ''have still to make up their minds''.
It is whether he is right about this or whether most minds are already
made up that will determine the outcome of the battle.

<TEXT>
FOR the seven unions involved it was a great day -- 100,000 or so
demonstrators, stretching for miles along the boulevards from the
Bastille in the east of Paris, westwards towards the Opera.
Last Tuesday's 24-hour strike by a majority of the country's five
million public sector workers was the biggest protest France has seen in
a decade or more.
Having started out as a demonstration against the Government's freeze
on wages in the public sector next year, it has developed into a
broad-based movement against poor pay and conditions. It is a serious
challenge to President Jacques Chirac's desperate efforts to reduce
public spending in order to respect France's obligations under the
Maastricht Treaty.
Sixty per cent of teachers and gas and electricity workers, 64% of
France Telecom employees, half the staff on railways, to mention only
the largest public sectors, were off work last Tuesday.
Even police, who do not have the right to strike, took days off to
join protest marches in Paris and the provinces. The Metro and bus
networks were practically idle, and the Paris region experienced an
eye-watering day of record-breaking pollution caused by the enormous
amount of commuter traffic which all but congealed in the city.
Because of the complicated mathematics of civil service pay rises, the
workers who went on strike last week will in fact receive a 3.1% hike
next year, despite the Government freeze which provoked the protests.
The underlying problem is more fundamentally bad pay and conditions.
Police have complained about salaries -- only #12,000 a year after seven
years in the force -- but, worse in their opinion, of a lack of such
vital materials as vehicles and radios.
Nurses have complained that a rapidly-reached pay ceiling and long
hours force many out of the profession after only a few years. France,
it seems, can simply no longer afford its extensive public sector.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe sacked right-wing Minister of Economics
Alain Madelin in August for stepping out of line on how to reduce public
spending.
The premier, now at a record low of unpopularity, has damaged
Government credibility with his own clumsy attempt to freeze wages in
the public sector. As if that were not enough, Mr Juppe escaped
resignation by the skin of his teeth last week, when a prosecutor ruled
he would not press corruption charges against him for having lowered the
rent of his son's Paris city council apartment.
The Prime Minister tried to recover some dignity over accusations that
he had squandered public money on his own rented accommodation by
announcing he was moving house.
With such morally discredited, hesitant, and divided leadership, and
pressure building up in the public sector and the people at large, the
time may even be ripe, in the opinion of France's most influential
trades union leader, Marc Blondel of Force Ouvriere, for a repetition of
May 1968, when student riots and a general strike almost unseated
General de Gaulle.

SCOTTISH police forces yesterday were promised 500 more officers by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in the latest part of a law-and-order
package -- announced at the Tory conference by the Prime Minister --
which already includes a promise of tougher sentencing and an extension
of closed-circuit television surveillance of city streets.
No-one at the Scottish Office could say what the total costs of the
new measures will be, but the indications are that the budget, which
could run to #15m, has total priority. That could be read as meaning
that other budgets will be cut back to accommodate the vote-winning,
crime-fight increase.
Mr Forsyth said: ''Yesterday, I announced proposals for dealing with
criminals once they had been caught and convicted. Today I am announcing
plans to help the people who have to catch them.''
Interestingly, the announcement comes immediately after the Lord Chief
Justice in England attacked similar Home Office statements, pointing out
that career criminals were not in the least deterred by the prospect of
marginally longer prison sentences but only by the greater prospect of
being caught. He had added that the chances of that currently weresmall.
Mr Forsyth's package on extra police was not as handsome as it
appeared at first blush, with the figure of 500 being spread over three
years.
Taken across the board, that would mean roughly an extra 21 officers a
year for each of the eight Scottish forces, with no indication whether
this would mean new money for new officers or whether it would be
achieved by further civilianisation of existing police posts.
However, police forces welcomed the additional resources -- the plans
are for 5000 extra police for Britain as a whole.
Chief Superintendent Jack Urquhart, president of the Scottish
Association of Police Superintendents, said: ''Mr Forsyth has listened
to the police service and the public and has acted promptly. We await
details of how the additional officers are to be funded.''
Chief Superintendent Urquhart also welcomed the additional resources
to be provided for closed-circuit TV, which, he said, had cost
implications for setting up, running and maintaining the systems which
could not be overlooked.
He added that his association looked forward to being involved in
discussions about the proposed involvement of the security services in
the drive against drugs trafficking and organised crime.
Mr James Fraser, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, the main
police union, welcomed the announcement, adding: ''While the streets
will hardly be flooded by new officers, it will make a difference.
''We have to be slightly circumspect because we do not know whether he
is talking about 500 new officers or another round of civilianising to
release officers for beat duties. We have supported civilianisation but
it cannot be allowed to go too far,'' he said.
In announcing the law-and-order package in his Blackpool speech, Mr
Major said that local police forces were not equipped to deal with the
''sheer evil of the drugs trade'' and the Government was now discussing
with the police setting up a national squad.
''This will have one mission -- to take on organised crime in this
country and break it.''
The police would take the lead on the new initiative and there would
be an important role for the Security Service, MI5. They would have the
support of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, working with
Customs, MI6 and GCHQ.
Mr Major said it was absurd that MI5 could not help the police with
their work in an age when ''our children are more likely to be killed by
a drug dealer than an enemy missile''.
At present, the Security Service's statutory remit is limited to
national security and the protection of Britain's economic well-being
against threats from abroad.
However, the Prime Minister said organised crime was a ''threat to the
state'' and the Government would act this autumn to change the law to
allow MI5 to tackle it.

* ALONG with drunks and crazies, snoozing drivers cause a substantial
portion of accidents on the roads. Now one major car maker is developing
a system designed to prevent drivers falling asleep at the wheel.
It is part of Toyota's safety program in its new advanced safety
technology concept car which will lead to various extra protection
features in production models. The ASV is equipped with 17 new advances
designed to prevent accidents or to minimise the damage when they do.
Some monitor the driver rather than the car, including the drowsy
driver warning system designed to prevent people falling asleep at the
wheel. Sensors monitor the steering operation and the driver's pulse to
detect falling levels of alertness. The system then gives an audio
visual warning, an electronic wake-up nudge, and advises the driver to
take a break.
If that is ignored, the seat vibrates with a further warning signal,
and if the sleepily stubborn driver persists, it takes the ultimate
sanction -- not of giving him an electric shock in the seat of his
pants, but by activating the electronically controlled throttle and
brake whereby the car will stop.
Other warnings include a signal when tyre pressures are too low. There
is an air-bag on the hood designed to protect pedestrians who have just
been hit, and an accident reporting program to report information to
emergency services.
The new concept car also has a corner monitoring system which uses
cameras to display a wide field of vision on the car's monitor to help
prevent accidents at blind spots, and some very courteous signalling
known as a lamp-based inter vehicle system to communicate with other
road users, including an ''after you'' signal at junctions and ''braking
soon'' warnings.
One that says ''idiot'' would be too much to hope for.
A further advance, which should be in all cars, is a drive recorder
system, the road equivalent of a plane's black box that records details
of the car, driver, and passengers before and after an accident, with
images from the cameras to back up the facts. This obviates the need to
fill in those insurance diagrams showing who was where, when, and at
what speed.

Sarajevo
UP TO 40,000 civilians fled in panic from the Serb-held town of
Prijedor in north-west Bosnia today when it was shelled by Muslim and
Croat forces ignoring the country's new ceasefire.
UN aid workers said many were heading for the nearby Bosnian Serb
bastion town of Banja Luka, which fears it could be the next target of
the Muslim-Croat offensive.
Bosnian Serb ''president'' Radovan Karadzic was visiting Prijedor when
the shells began to fall.
He urged his forces to recapture the town.
''I am requesting the whole people to gear up towards defence,''
Karadzic said on local radio.
''I am asking the soldiers to have a short break and then rejoin their
units. There should be no retreat. They should only go forward. And we
can liberate Sanski Most and certainly defend Prijedor.''
Karadzic added: ''I might even say that with small, insignificant
forces, the Muslims have been able to break through our lines. We will
organise a determined defence and we will recapture this territory.''
He appealed to the United States to use its diplomatic influence to
enforce the ceasefire that began yesterday and appeared to have been
observed elsewhere in Bosnia.
Journalists said Sanski Most was almost empty of civilians and
government troops were firing heavy artillery, howitzers, and rockets
towards Serb lines to the north.
''We are not attacking the Serbs. They are provoking us and we have to
respond,'' said Major Muhamed Babic of the Bosnian government 5th Corps.
''We are advancing defensively.''
People in Banja Luka, 30 miles from Sanski Most and the biggest
Serb-held town, described the atmosphere there as ''quite close to
panic''.
They said many people were packing their bags but were waiting to see
how close Muslim and allied Croat troops came before fleeing.
The scale of the fighting contrasted with assurances by Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic and UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that the
ceasefire would succeed in halting the war ahead of peace talks.
Banja Luka, temporary seat of the Bosnian Serb government and BSA
general staff, is a strategic and industrial prize whose loss would be
the most stunning Serb reversal of the 3[1/2]-year war.
At the start of the conflict, when the BSA's superiority in tanks and
artillery made it almost invincible, the Serbs drove thousands of
Muslims and Croats from the Banja Luka region, including Prijedor.
Aid officials said Banja Luka's fall would unleash a humanitarian
catastrophe with up to 700,000 refugees of all ages driven east to find
secure Serb territory.
The UN Security Council, anxious to halt the fighting, demanded full
compliance with the ceasefire and urged the rival armies to stop driving
civilians from their homes.
The extent of compliance with the ceasefire outside Sarajevo and UN
''safe areas'' is difficult for the United Nations to monitor accurately
because its access is deliberately limited by the warring sides.
All sides will meet in the United States at the end of this month for
peace talks that international mediators hope will lead to agreement on
the division of Bosnia between Serbs and a Muslim-Croat
federation.--Reuter.

HOLDERS of Britain's highest awards for bravery yesterday warmly
welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement that their annuity -- frozen
at #100 a year since 1959 -- will be increased to #1300.
Many of the surviving 33 Victoria Cross and 48 George Cross heroes,
now mostly in their seventies and eighties, have had trouble making ends
meet.
''It's marvellous news,'' said William Reid, 73, of Crieff, who won
the VC as a 21-year-old flight lieutenant. ''This will make a big

Christchurch
THE judge in New Zealand's so-called ''poisoned professor'' case, in
which a scientist is accused of trying to kill her former lover, ordered
a retrial when the jury failed to reach a verdict after deliberating for
18 hours.
Victoria Calder, 46, a molecular biologist, denied the attempted
murder of her lover of seven years, Professor David Lloyd. She was
remanded on bail until October 27.
She is alleged to have administered acrylamide monomer, a dangerous
nerve toxin, to Lloyd, one of only seven New Zealanders to be elected a
fellow of the Royal Society.
The prosecution alleged that Calder was devastated when Lloyd told her
he wanted to end their relationship because he had fallen in love with
another woman.
Lloyd told friends when he was admitted to hospital after suffering
'flu-like symptoms that he believed he had been poisoned.
He later lapsed into a four-month coma. He regained consciousness, but
is blind, paralysed from the shoulders down, and can speak only with
great difficulty.
Calder's lawyer said during a three-week trial that while Calder had
been vengeful and spiteful after the separation, the professor's illness
and symptoms did not fit with reported cases of acrylamide poisoning and
looked more like a post-infectious disease.--Reuter.

THE Prime Minister yesterday put up a strong defence of the Union
following an eve-of-conference dinner earlier in the week with Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth hailed Mr Major's speech as ''by far the most outstanding
he has ever given.'' However, Opposition parties north of the Border
found it unpalatable and said Mr Major was out of touch and big on small
ideas.
The Scottish Secretary said: ''It was a great speech, well received.
His emphasis on Scotland was in marked contrast to that of Tony Blair
last week.
''He devoted a large section of his speech to Scotland, reflecting our
belief in the Union. He drew attention to the dangers for jobs and
inward investment of Labour's scheme and made clear he would have
nothing to do with their plans for a tartan tax. It was a strong defence
of the Union and I was grateful for that.''
The scathing reception north of the Border was led last night by
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson who said: ''Mr Major's
obstinate refusal to grant the Scots any meaningful form of
constitutional change is the greatest threat to the unity of Britain.
''Mr Major deserves this week's award for the biggest Tory pork pie of
them all -- the so-called tartan tax. There was only ever one tartan tax
-- and that was the poll tax.''
Mr Robertson said Labour had no plans to levy an extra tax on Scotland
and Mr Major knew it. ''Instead, our plans give the Scottish parliament
power to vary the basic rate of income tax in Scotland by a maximum of
3p in the #. That means it will have the power to cut taxes as well as
to raise them.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the party was delighted that the Tories
were choosing the constitution as the centrepiece of their next election
campaign because it showed that the pressure for change was beginning to
dawn even on a reluctant Mr Major.
He said: ''It is clearly not just Labour who are running scared of the
SNP. The Tories are being forced on to our ground. What Mr Major has yet
to understand is that no form of unelected council, quango or extension
of Westminster government will satisfy Scots, who want democracy,
freedom and self-determination.''
Mrs Ray Michie, Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman, said a promise
of more Tory tinkering was no substitute for a Scottish parliament.
''In a speech of small ideas, the section on Scotland was weakest of
all.Mr Major clearly does not understand the necessity for democratic
government in Scotland.
''He should be aware that it is the Tories continuing to ignore the
democratic will of the Scottish people that is most likely to lead to
the break-up of Britain.''

* THE long-sought teraflops computer, which will be 10 times more
powerful than the fastest machine today, is due by late next year under
a development contract announced today by the United States Department
of Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, and Intel Corp.
* LOS Alamos researchers have resolved by experiment a long-standing
problem in mechanics that will help them ensure that warheads do not
detonate when struck by a bullet or other high-speed fragment. This is
very good news. We always worried about madmen with guns shooting at
those innocent warheads.
* BAD news for voters in search of honest politicians. A professor of
psychology at Colgate University in New York has found that the best
leaders are often effective liars, too. And men and children are better
at it than women. Wonder why he thinks of them as the best leaders?
Maybe he asked them if they were the best and they just lied.
* THE biggest laser beam in the universe has been discovered by a NASA
observatory. Although lasers were only developed in 1960, long after
Einstein showed radiation stimulation was possible, this beam has been
shining its deadly ray for a long time. The NASA telescope has
discovered that a disc of gas around a hot star 4000 light years off in
space is sending out a beam, caused by the star's energy affecting
hydrogen atoms. The laser generator is huge -- about as wide as our
solar system.

INTERNET
* A NEW computer virus has been spreading on the World Wide Web,
possibly as a warning to users how vulnerable their systems might be to
a deadly infection. The ''Macro'' virus is not a killer. It has been
described as a prank that merely uses up space on computer discs.
This one spreads through documents created by Microsoft Word program
documents which, until now, have been assumed to be immune. Microsoft
are concerned enough to have issued hunter-killer programs to clean
systems.
The aptly named virus acts just like a real infection. It is a small
piece of digital program, like viral RNA, which gets into a system along
with other data and instructs the computer to replicate it on other
programs so that it gets passed on from one machine to another on discs.
Many of them carry other instructions that can be catastrophic, like
wiping hard-drives, or causing text to slide eerily off screens. The new
virus is a small program known as a macro which replicates when an
infected document is opened on the internet. It has been found on
systems all over the world and seems to be able to switch between
Windows and Mac systems.
Some experts believe the macro virus was created to show how it could
be done. While this virus does no damage, it could be altered to become
malignant and get into systems on programs downloaded from the web.
* DEMON Internet believe the number of the beast, 666, will bring them
luck. Or at least good business. They have announced the provision of
local-call access to the E-way for the whole of the United Kingdom, the
first service provider to do so.
Coverage begins at the end of this month, allowing all Demonoids a
connection at BT local call rate, in keeping with the company's
commitment to make the internet an affordable commodity for customers.
Along with the new rate, all Demon numbers will be pre-fixed by 666 (and
we can almost hear the Twilight Zone music) and impishly, they will
alter some of the dreadful dual-case acronyms.
TPoPs and vPoPs, traditional, and virtual points of presence will be
now be known as ROMPS, regionally organised modem pools. Now you know.
Access is at local rate and a vPoP is a romp which gets you on Route
666. What could be simpler? Advanced calculus, probably.
* THE new penchant for proving that size isn't everything continues
apace. Latest little beaut, as the name suggests, is the Mobifax from
Pace Micro Communications. It can send and receive faxes to and from any
fax machine in the world, direct from computer. According to Pace, the
gadget makes sending messages as easy as printing documents.
The Mobifax 144, at a recommended price of #139, comes complete with
error correction and data compression and sends at 14,400 bps. It has
auto dial and answer, call progress monitoring, and even a loudspeaker.
Described as a complete one-stop method of getting computer-connected,
it also comes with software, cables, a power adapter, and battery. The
deal also offers free registration and on-line time for CompuServe Info
service. Pace, of Shipley, West Yorkshire, also offer a five-year
warranty.

ENVIROMENT
THE concrete jungle may not seem the most environmentally friendly
place, but while campaigners save the rainforests, concrete could be a
solution to one potential ecological disaster . . . the greenhouse
effect.
Scientists worried about global climate change caused by the effect --
the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- may have found a
safe and permanent way to get rid of the gas produced in billion-ton
quantities by burning coal and oil.
Klaus Lackner of Los Alamos national lab believes it can be ''locked
up'' by combining it chemically with abundant raw materials to form
stable carbonate minerals. An economical method of capturing carbon
dioxide could allow continued use of the world's huge investment in
fossil fuel power plants, even if global warming is shown to be a
serious threat.
Minerals containing substantial amounts of magnesium oxide or calcium
oxide react with carbon dioxide, forming limestone, dolomite, or
magnesite. These minerals, and even common cement, pick up carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere at room temperature, but the process is very
slow. Scientists measure the pick-up rate in geological time.
However, it is possible to speed up these natural reactions to the
point where carbon dioxide can be captured at the same rate that it is
generated in the burning of fossil fuels, using simple chemical
reactions.
Pure calcium and magnesium oxides are rarely found in nature, but many
common minerals contain combinations of these oxides mixed with other
minerals. Enough of these minerals could be mined as raw materials for
mixing with carbon dioxide to allow use of all known fossil fuel
reserves for centuries to come -- while avoiding the build-up of
greenhouse gases.
Lackner said: ''This technology may be an insurance policy in the
short run, if political pressure from the perceived threat of global
warming forces industry to limit carbon dioxide emissions. In the long
run, there may be no way around it. Greatly increased use of fossil
fuels could render industrial-scale carbon dioxide fixation absolutely
necessary.''
The research shows that two of the most promising materials,
peridotites and serpentinites, could be used in the process. Carbon
dioxide piped from a coal-burning power plant could be pumped into
pulverised, heated rock. The result would be a stable compound from
which the greenhouse gas could not escape.
The carbonation reaction frees substantial heat, which can be used to
power the operation so the cost of capturing carbon dioxide at an
industrial scale will be determined by the simplicity and speed of the
reaction, rather than the cost of energy. Finally, the carbonated
minerals are stable, so they could be used to refill the holes where the
minerals were mined.
It may even be possible to pump the carbon dioxide directly into an
underground deposit of porous, magnesium, or calcium-bearing rock. The
carbonation process of simply burying the gas would be slow, but it
might be very economical.

A PILOT died yesterday when his plane crashed on a mist-shrouded
hillside on the Isle of Man.
Searchers found the body of Mr Norman Faulds, 52, of Bride, Isle of
Man, in the wreckage of the twin-engined Cessna.
The plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from
an airstrip in the north of the island.
It was heading for an airstrip in the south, a journey that should
have taken 15 minutes at most.
Contact was lost in the area of Snaefell, a 620-metre peak.
The wreckage was found on Slieau Ruy, a hill to the south of there, at
a height of about 350 metres.
Weather conditions were bad, with mist, poor visibility, and rain.
The Cessna was of an unusual type, with a propeller fore and aft with
a twin-boom tail, a variant favoured by air cargo companies.
A police spokesman at Douglas said two dogs on the plane had been
found dead at the scene of the crash.
The reason for the pilot having dogs with him was not known but a
member of the search and rescue team said: ''There are no rules saying
you can't.''

<TEXT>
AN independent engineering expert has backed claims that cracks in the
#25m Skye bridge are not serious and pose no threat to public safety.
0 Professor Iain MacLeod, a structural engineer at Strathclyde
University's civil engineering department, commenting on newspaper
photographs of the cracks, said: ''The cracks don't look serious to me.
''I don't know what size they are but the direction indicates that
they are not causing structural stress to the bridge and are unlikely to
cause any collapse.
''The pictures don't show the original cracks -- only the repaired
ones which look much worse because of scarring -- and I don't see any
safety problems with the bridge.''
The Scottish-German consortium Miller-Dywidag, which built the bridge,
and the Scottish Office both rejected suggestions in a newspaper report
that the structure was unsafe, claiming the ''cosmetic'' cracks were not
unusual or unexpected and were being fully repaired.
Mr Keith Miller, chief executive of the Falkirk-based Miller group,
said: ''We refute totally any suggestion that the quality of engineering
and craftsmanship is of anything less than the highest standards.''
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council, whose chief structural
engineer has been involved in the monitoring of the bridge's
construction, said it had known about the cracks for some time.
''They are not of any significance. They are shrinkage cracks caused
by temperature changes while the concrete is still immature and have not
been caused by stress.
''If they were not repaired, then sea water could get in and cause
corrosion. But they have been and are being repaired.''
Local MP Charles Kennedy has called for an independent inspection of
the bridge to allay public fears, and will boycott Monday's opening
ceremony to be performed by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.

DUNDEE MPs yesterday called for more cash and equipment for the city's
Ninewells Hospital following four allegations of recent blunders there.
Labour MPs John McAllion and Ernie Ross are demanding that the
hospital should be equipped with a cardiac surgery unit to save patients
from having to travel to other Scottish hospitals for operations.
In the past week, there have been claims that a 64-year-old woman
suffered massive brain damage because staff refused to call out a heart
specialist at the weekend, a 57-year-old woman collapsed and died in one
of the hospital lifts only hours after she had been sent home, and
another elderly woman died in agony after spending 24 hours with a burst
blood vessel.
In addition, the family of a Lancashire man have claimed that a
misdiagnosis at the hospital almost killed him.
Mr McAllion and Mr Ross met with trust medical director Dr Derek
Maclean and other hospital officials, and received a full briefing on
each of the cases.
Dr Maclean confirmed yesterday that a full investigation was under
way.
After the meeting, Mr McAllion, MP for Dundee East and Labour's
Scottish health spokesman, said: ''We are lending our backing to the
trust bid for extra money to replace old equipment and improve services
at Ninewells.
''Some of the equipment at the hospital is 20 years old and badly in
need of replacing.''
Mr McAllion stressed: ''A hospital the size of Ninewells really should
have a cardiac surgery unit. It is not acceptable that patients have to
be transferred to other Scottish hospitals.
''There are four specialists at the hospital but not enough equipment.
Ninewells is facing the same problems as other hospitals in the NHS.''

WITH Hallowe'en coming up fast, the demand for turnip lanterns to mark
the traditional festival is being met by a Berwickshire firm of
vegetable growers with the aid of a unique machine . . . and
'magicians'.
Staff at R and K Drysdale's premises at Cockburnspath are turning raw
turnips into lanterns at the rate of 10 a minute. The firm's
specially-designed Hallowe'en Mask machine is automated and requires no
manual attention after the raw turnip is fed in.
On its circular journey in six stages, the turnip has its top and
bottom sliced off, its centre removed, and the eyes, nose, and mouth of
the face put in. The top is retained in the process and forms a lid for
the finished product. When the lantern is ready, the candle is inserted.
Drysdale will this year make 40,000 lanterns, to be sold in shops and
supermarkets in England as well as Scotland. Work began a few days ago
and will continue until October 30.
The firm started growing and supplying vegetables in 1968 and hit on
the notion for this imaginative new line in recent years. Mr Robin
Drysdale, joint owner with his younger brother, Kim, said: ''We got the
idea for a machine to make the lanterns two or three years before we
found somebody to design it.''
The answer was provided by Faber Design Consultancy, a firm of
consultant engineers in Leyland, Lancashire, which designs and supplies
original mechanical and electrical special-purpose machinery.
Mr Drysdale called the machine ''a complicated thing'' and described
the designers as ''magicians''.

THE lover of both Rosemary and Frederick West was living in fear of
her sexual partners immediately before she disappeared, Winchester Crown
Court was told yesterday.
Ms Shirley Robinson, who was carrying Mr West's child, was last seen
sipping a cup of tea in a friend's bedsit at 25 Cromwell Street,
Gloucester, the jury of eight men and four women heard.
Next day, the Wests seemed happy as they claimed that Ms Robinson, who
was then aged 17 and eight months pregnant, had left to live in Germany.
The court heard that Mrs West had become jealous of Ms Robinson
because she was having her husband's child.
Ms Robinson's mutilated remains were recovered last year from the
garden at 25 Cromwell Street. Mrs West denies murdering her and nine
other women and young girls.
Mrs Elizabeth Brewer, 35, said that, when she first lodged at 25
Cromwell Street, there seemed to be a happy relationship between Ms
Robinson and the Wests. However, things seemed to turn sour.
Ms Robinson was becoming more and more emotional towards Mr West and
there were rows. Mrs Brewer said that Ms Robinson had become frightened
of the Wests and wanted to keep away from them. As a consequence, she
moved into her room for a week or two.
The last time she saw Ms Robinson, she seemed frightened and
depressed. Mrs Brewer said she had plans to meet friends at a cafe and
invited Ms Robinson. However, she was eight months pregnant and just
wanted to return to sleep. Mrs Brewer left her friend drinking a cup of
tea in her room.
When Mrs Brewer returned later that afternoon, Ms Robinson had gone.
She went to her room on the floor below and knocked but the door was
locked and there was nobody there.
The next morning, Mr West came to Mrs Brewer's door and told her that
Ms Robinson had gone to Germany to live with members of her family.
Another reason for leaving, Mr West told her, was that Ms Robinson had
this sexual fantasy about how she would rip Mrs Brewer's knickers off.
''If she hadn't left, this was what she was going to do,'' he said.
Mrs Brewer told the court that when she heard about this fantasy, she
was glad that Ms Robinson had gone.
She said Mr West seemed to take great delight in relating the fantasy,
especially as he did so in front of her boyfriend, Peter. ''Mrs West was
nodding in agreement with everything he was saying,'' she added.
Mrs Brewer told the court the Wests later led her to believe they were
keeping in touch with Ms Robinson in Germany. They said that she had had
her baby, a boy named Barry. They also led her to believe Ms Robinson
would be returning to Cromwell Street when Mrs West planned to help her
look after the baby.
In cross examination, Mrs Brewer said she had received #3200 from the
media. She told Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending, that after the
remains were recovered from Cromwell Street she began to write a book.
Community nurse Jane Bayle described how as a schoolgirl she visited
her cousin, Mrs Brewer, at Cromwell Street. At the time, she did not
have much to do with Mrs West. ''She made me unnerved. She stared a lot
and dressed like a child,'' said Mrs Bayle.
Ms Robinson had lived in three rooms during the periods she visited
the house. She had her own room, she slept in Rosemary's and Frederick's
bedroom, and then moved into her cousin's room. ''She was having a
sexual relationship with both of them,'' she said.
Another lodger, Ms Claire Rigby, saw Mrs West in Ms Robinson's room
putting piles of clothes into plastic carrier bags about two weeks after
she disappeared. ''I presumed they were Shirley's,'' she said.
Ms Kathleen Ryan, the sister of another lodger at the West house,
recalled being taken into the lounge at 25 Cromwell Street. There Mr
West introduced her to those in the room. Ms Ryan said: ''He told me:
'These are my children, this is my wife', pointing to Rose, 'and this is
my lover'. I looked at my sister and thought 'God, this is a bit
weird'.''
Mrs Jillian Britt also became a lodger at 25 Cromwell Street in 1977
when she was 17. There was a bedroom with the words ''Rose's room'' on
the door. In the evening, always after midnight, men would go in there,
sometimes two or three at a time. She heard noises coming from the room.
At this stage, Mr Ferguson intervened, saying: ''This makes great copy
but has little to do with the evidence. We accept that Mrs West had men
friends. Call it what you like. This is pandering to the least desirable
elements who are following this case.''
Nevertheless, Mr Justice Mantell allowed the prosecution to continue
with this line of questioning and Ms Britt told the court: ''At night,
we would hear noises -- thumping, crashing about, wails -- which I would
describe of being of a sexual nature. Perhaps shrieks would be a better
word. It didn't sound that anybody was having any pleasure.''
The trial continues.

LABOUR MP Bob Hughes, who recently celebrated 25 years in the Aberdeen
North seat, is being challenged for the new Aberdeen Central candidacy
by former Aberdeen South MP Frank Doran.
The confrontation comes as a result of boundary changes.
The decision on the prospective parliamentary candidate in what is
seen as a solid Labour seat will be made next Thursday in a one member,
one vote ballot.
The new Aberdeen Central comprises of half of the Aberdeen North
constituency and half of the Aberdeen South marginal which Mr Doran took
from Conservative Gerry Malone in 1987 but lost to current Scottish
Office Minister Raymond Robertson in 1992.
The secretary of Aberdeen Central Labour Party, Mrs Christina Woods
said there had been four nominations for the candidacy.
The other two were Mrs Margaret Clyne, a regional councillor, and Mr
Kevin Hutcheon, a ''great member of the Labour party''.
In going forward to the short leet, Mr Doran received 16 votes and Mr
Hughes nine. Mrs Woods said that, as sitting MP, Mr Hughes had the
automatic right to apply but had also been nominated. She said he would
also have the automatic right to apply in Aberdeen North.
The short leet is decided in voting by branch members, trade unions,
and affiliated organisations.
Thursday's decision will be made by card-carrying members of the
Labour Party who have lived in the constituency for at least a year.
Although Aberdeen Central looked a safe Labour seat, it was reckoned
Aberdeen North also looked fairly secure for Labour.
Aberdeen South, where Labour will put up a female candidate, was a
close-run battle in the local elections, with the Liberal Democrats
beating Labour by less than 1% and with the Conservatives just 3.4%
further back.

COMPUTERS
* COUNTDOWN, the Channel 4 words and numbers quiz show game featuring
the arithmetic Carol Vorderman and the lexical Richard Whitely, is now
playable as a computer game.
VCI Software have repackaged the title, initially developed by Lockton
Software, to release it on both PC and CD-Rom formats priced at nearly
#20.
The game apparently replicates the competitive word and number format
of the television show, including Dictionary Corner, and VCI say it also
includes the tension of the music as the countdown clock ticks away.
For those with something better to do, there's always the chance to
tune into Home and Away, , the Aussie soap that still hasn't been
digitised.

DIARY OF FRIDA KAHLO; An Intimate Self-Portrait
Bloomsbury, #25
THIS is the stuff of Hollywood -- but also a moving, true story of a
desperate, wild life lived to the end with panache and courage. I found
the book gripping and inspiring.
Frida Kahlo, one of the most glamorous and magnetic women of her time,
was virtually a cripple. Born in 1907, married -- twice -- to the
flamboyant Mexican mural painter Diego Rivera, her many lovers included
Trotsky, the sculptor Noguchi, and the revolutionary de Campo. She
painted memorable, surreal pictures and portraits, exhibiting in New
York and Paris in the 1930s where Edward G Robinson, among others,
bought her work.
This extraordinary book lets you read Kahlo's mind, see her highs and
lows, via her own work. Illustrated throughout with her lush, seductive,
colourful, expressionist, often irrational images, it traces the last
decade of her turbulent life via her own journal. This intimate diary is
peppered with writings, poems and secret thoughts from 1944-54 and is
reproduced in facsimile together with essays and explanations of Kahlo's
text by the celebrated writer Carlos Fuentes and by Kahlo's biographer,
Sarah Lowe.
Kahlo the siren, always an exotic fiesta vision in ornate, beribboned,
and frilled Mexican peasant finery, her earrings big as cartwheels, her
fingers laden with rings, was in fact a broken, twisted, pain-racked
body supported by orthopaedic corsets.
At seven she contracted polio. Eleven years later a near-fatal
streetcar crash resulted in a broken spine, collar, and pelvis and
crushed right leg and foot. Despite 35 operations she lived life to the
full, and is remembered as being funny, witty, a good mimic, and source
of jokes and vitality. Her paintings show her vivid imaginings, her
dreams -- and her reality.
Faces -- often her own, feet, (perfect not deformed) eyes, patterns,
animals, weird mythological beasts, pregnant angels, and text fill the
pages with exotic rich sunburst red, yellow, purple, pink, and blue
watercolours.
Diego, her true love, features prominently on many pages: She used to
joke that she had suffered two accidents in her life: the tram crash and
Diego Rivera. He admitted he was unfaithful: ''The more I loved her, the
more I wanted to hurt her.'' She absorbed the hurt in pantheistic
manner.
Kahlo is the supreme example of an artist whose ''pencils sharpened to
the point of infinity'' have ensured her immortality.

A BOOK AT BEDTIME
Cardinal Winning tells ANN DONALD what he reads before going to sleep
at night
* I READ a very humorous book by Greg Knight the Conservative MP for
Derby North called Parliamentary Sauce which has a big bottle of HP on
the cover. What this fellow had done is gather together a collection of
sayings from members of parliament of all political shades, sizes and
shapes -- even Maria Fyffe is in it. It's a real scream with some
powerful political invective and some rather hurtful phrases. One that
comes to mind is quote from an MP about Margaret Thatcher -- ''I have a
real soft spot for her. A swamp at the bottom of my garden.'' Or there's
another one that goes ''he reminds me of a shiver looking for a spine to
run up''. I bought it in one of those bucket shops for #3.99.
The other book is Peter Habelthwaite's biography of Pope Paul VI who
was Pope from 1963-1978. The author is an ex-Jesuit and a very
intelligent man who has, I feel, matured over the years and is not
termed a ''vaticanologist''. He's emerged from this as a very honest
writer, and given Habelthwaite's background as a very liberal Catholic,
I would have thought he'd have given Paul VI a tough time, but on the
contrary he describes him as one of the greatest Pope's this century.
Paul VI was the man who wrote Humane Vitae and turned the Catholic
church upside down as far as contraception is concerned. In fact after
Humane Vitae he never wrote again because of the hurt he suffered.
I felt that the corroboration of Paul VI came from a very unlikely
source in Habelthwaite. As a Pope, Paul VI had a big job to do and I'm
sure he made his decision regarding Humane Vitae based on a prayerful
reflection, discerning what God would have wanted. At least that's the
way we would see it.
The final conclusion Habelthwaite makes is defining Paul's greatness
in balancing the different tensions inherent to the Catholic church of
the sixties. He managed to balance the past, the present, the future,
the liberals, and the conservatives within turbulent times.

<HEADLINE>Vein 'stocking' could revolutionise open-heart surgery</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975896829</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SURGEONS are developing a support ''stocking'' for transplanted veins
in open-heart surgery.
Researchers at Bristol University have applied an engineering solution
to the recurring problem of furring in the by-pass veins which can lead
to a second and riskier operation.
They are planning clinical trials later this year at Bristol Royal
Infirmary. The novel approach involves slipping a tube of synthetic
material over the vein like a support stocking.
A pilot study has produced excellent results and the researchers are
confident the device could solve the furring, which reduces blood flow
and therefore the effectiveness of the transplant.
Around 40 patients will be asked to take part in the new technique.
Their progress will be monitored alongside 40 patients whose by-pass
operations will follow current procedures. Surgeons believe that within
a few months of each operation they will be able to measure the benefits
of the stocking support.
Coronary by-pass operations are a successful procedure worldwide
although plagued by furring within 10 years. In Britain alone there are
25,000 operations each year. They involve 50,000 transplanted veins, of
which two out of three are hit by furring.
Veins are generally taken from the leg, where there is low-pressure
blood flow. The Bristol scientists believe that furring is the vein
cells' violent reaction to the high-pressure demands of the heart.
The stocking solution leaves a gap between the outer vein wall and the
device. Vessels grow out from the vein wall to fill the gap. The new
growth acts as a filter, keeping the vein clear and maintaining blood
flow.
The novel technique was revealed yesterday at the launch of the
Bristol Heart Institute at Bristol Royal Infirmary. The official opening
was carried out by television presenter Jill Dando, who had a
hole-in-the-heart operation as a child in Bristol.
The institute plans to have its own building bringing together leading
collaborators in surgical, clinical, and research expertise. They have
made Bristol a recognised centre of excellence in the cardio-vascular
field.
British Heart Foundation Professor Gianni Angelini, who heads a
50-strong multi-disciplinary team at the department of cardiac surgery,
is joined by a team from the university's medical school under Dr Andrew
Helstrop and by Professor Andrew Newby, a cell biology expert from the
University of Wales College of Medicine.
Professor Angelini, who is also an engineering graduate, said: ''The
stocking is the result of 10 years of research in which we have gained a
better understanding of the cell-level processes involved in furring. We
have applied an engineering solution to a low-pressure vessel -- the
vein -- operating in a high-pressure system. We are confident that we
should get good results.''
Heart surgery worldwide could be revolutionised by the stocking
technique.
The medical director of the British Heart Foundation, Professor Brian
Pentecost, said 170,000 people a year died in the UK from heart disease
-- more than any other single cause.
He predicted that the institute would become one of the
''powerhouses'' of cardio-vascular research.
The BHF, which donates #30m a year to research, has put #2m into the
institute.
At yesterday's launch, Professor Angelini said half of heart by-pass
graft veins furred up within five to 10 years.
He hoped the stocking would either prevent furring or lengthen the
life of the by-pass graft to 15 to 20 years.
''It would not be an understatement to say if this was to prove
successful in a larger clinical study, it would revolutionise coronary
surgery worldwide,'' said Professor Angelini.

LADY CHATTERLEY'S CONFESSION
Elaine Feinstein
Macmillan, #10.50
LADY Chatterley and her lover ran away, had fantastic sex, and were
happy ever after. Or were they? Even people who haven't read Lady
Chatterley's Lover often know the story, more or less: Constance
(Connie) Chatterley, a young woman married to a war-wounded and
emotionally dead aristocrat, has a sensual and tender affair with her
husband's gamekeeper Mellors. D H Lawrence's last novel, published in
1928, is not his best, but it is his most notorious (a lot of sex, a lot
of bad words), and its plot, reduced to its simplest terms, has the
force of a kind of myth.
Elaine Feinstein, a distinguished poet and novelist who has also
written critically about Lawrence, now offers us a ''sequel'', which,
like Emma Tennant's fictional engagements with male precursors, offers
us an interesting perspective on a famous text, re-reading the ''myth''
in challenging ways.
The end of Lawrence's novel is relatively open: Connie is pregnant
with a child by Mellors, and although the lovers are apart, they are
disentangling from their other commitments, hoping to be together.
Feinstein picks up the threads of the plot, but from the start there are
important shifts in her handling of the narrative.
Lawrence's novel was in the third person, slyly angled: a male
novelist's version of a female character's perspective. Feinstein's
Confession offers us Connie's own, first-person account of how she and
Mellors, after an attempt at farming in England, run away, not
implausibly, to Italy. There they live out a rustic idyll, raising their
daughter Emily, and enjoying sexual fulfilment. For a while.
But then the idyll starts to sour. The class differences between
Connie and Mellors start to matter. And Mellors gets rough and selfish
in bed, violent, even. Connie isn't so happy, after all. ''Ideas aren't
good for women,'' Mellors tells her. She starts to rebel: ''Unlike Hilda
(her sister), I had never been much concerned with rights for women, but
I was incensed at this.''
Feinstein threads in actual passages from Lawrence's work, showing
them in a new light. ''You were a real woman once,'' Mellors informs
Connie, and although at first she internalises his accusations of
''unseemly lust and ugly sexual behaviour'', she begins to see Mellors
as the one with the problems. ''The anger he felt against me seemed to
connect with every other disappointment in his life.''
Apparently the book-loving Mellors wishes he had gone to university,
for instance.
In Feinstein's reading, Lady Chatterley's Lover is deeply problematic
in its ''message'' for women; and its politics in other senses are taken
up, too. Lawrence's novel ends with a long letter to Connie from Mellors
in which he bemoans the state of modern society. Feinstein, pursuing
this, has Mellors turn to fascism; this is, after all, Italy in the
1930s. Connie, horrified by these developments, has, by the end,
ironically, taken up with a young Jewish intellectual, though her future
again looks uncertain.
Mellors is the focus for critical questioning, but he is not a
grotesquely oversimplified figure. As he grows more angry and unwell,
''his bearded face was lined with pain'', and he sounds increasingly
like the sick novelist himself, who wrote Lady Chatterley when he was
living in Italy and had only two more years to live, whose own
relationships underlie his fiction, and whose late work especially seems
to many commentators to show fascist sympathies.
''I know what is killing me,'' said Mellors. ''It's Europe, that
disgusting old bitch of a dead culture.'' Lawrence's own words.
Connie's lover, the young Jew, Lehmann, comments of a contemporary
writer: ''Ezra Pound is a fine poet, but I don't like his opinions.''
Feinstein's novel acts as a highly readable and accessible critique of
Lawrence's often very awkward opinions, and offers insight into the
Europe of his time.
What Lady Chatterley's Confession does not -- perhaps cannot -- do, is
match Lawrence's poetic power. For all his sometimes barmy, sometimes
appalling ideas, his over-insistence and stylistic mannerisms, Lawrence
could write fiction that was lushly sensuous, vivid, and often moving.
Feinstein has chosen for Connie a simple, unadorned style, which
sometimes falls into cliche: ''I looked at the blue light behind the
cypress and felt tears of loneliness come into my eyes. Was there to be
no more tenderness between us?'' Their daughter Emily is described as
''a creature from an elfin world''.
Feinstein's novel is intelligent and worthwhile. But potty old
Lawrence wrote some great prose.

RIVER OF TIME, Jon Swain, Heineman, #16.99
ALL war correspondents flirt with extreme danger, and for some it
becomes a fatal attraction. Those who survive close encounters with
death may experience an enormous sense of relief, but they are never
quite the same again. At best, they are left with an uneasy feeling that
perhaps they should not be alive.
Jon Swain has had this sense of living on borrowed time for 20 years.
His close call came in the grounds of a hospital in Phnom Penh in April,
1975, a few hours after the Cambodian city had fallen to communist
forces. Swain, along with Sydney Schanberg of the New York Times and
Dith Pran, his interpreter and guide, had just witnessed scenes of
horror in wards awash with blood.
As they drove cautiously towards the street, they were stopped by half
a dozen young Khmer Rouge soldiers, some of them boys barely taller than
their automatic rifles, and dragged out of the car. Swain's description
of what happened next is terse: ''Their leader's eyes were coals of
hate. He was screaming and ranting, foaming at the mouth. He held his
pistol against my head, finger firm on the trigger. My hands were high
in the air and I was paralysed with fear. My camera, notebooks, and
other belongings littered the ground where the Khmer Rouge had thrown
them. The seconds ticked by.''
Swain survived thanks to Pran, who spoke softly but urgently in Khmer,
and eventually persuaded the Khmer Rouge that the two westerners were
neutral journalists there to witness the historic ''liberation'' of
Cambodia. A few weeks later they were unable to save Pran from being
dragged into the slave-labour camps of the hideous Pol Pot regime. The
interpreter's survival was documented in the film The Killing Fields,
and now we have Swain's broader picture of the last, tumultous days of
the war in Indo-China.
The obvious question is why has it taken him so long to write River of
Time, an account of the five years he spent in Cambodia and Vietnam as a
correspondent of Agence France-Presse, and then as a freelance.
Publication timed to coincide with the film would surely have made more
commercial sense. Swain explains: ''I've always wanted to write it, but
for years the memories were too painful''.
This is reflected in his book, which is permeated with a sense of loss
-- of friends who were killed, of a love affair that could not survive
his obsession with his work, of an exotic society and a way of life that
had enchanted him. It is a deeply personal account that says as much
about the exhilaration and moral dilemnas of reporting wars as about the
conflicts themselves.
With disarming candour, Swain admits: ''War is a kind of jailbreak
which we welcomed for its freedoms and its lifting of every kind of
taboo . . . for most of us the enemy was not the deadly carnage in the
Cambodian fields, but the tedium of life itself; especially the
perceived dreariness and conformity we had left behind in the West . . .
''
When he went to Vietnam he found ''an adventure playground for
journalism, a place for a young man to test and be tested in the most
exotic environment imaginable. The proximity of death amid such beauty
seemed to give, to me at least, a quality of life unattainable
elsewhere''.
Swain has nothing new to say about wars in general, or the nightmare
in Indo-China in particular. His book appears to be more of an attempt
by a sensitive man to lay the ghosts of an old war that have been
haunting him since the last shots were fired. In the process, however,
he has produced a classic of war reportage in which the whiff of cordite
comes off every page.
Like all good journalists, Swain has an eye for fine detail which he
uses effectively to portray the absurdities as well as the obscenities,
of war. A pageant of colourful characters is memorably described -- the
British defence attache standing resolutely on the tarmac at Phnom Penh
airport during a rocket attack as everybody else dives for cover;
Cambodia's finest surgeon reciting Ariel's song from The Tempest as he
rummages in a soldier's stomach for a suspected unexploded grenade; the
drunken Cambodian general who places a milk tin on his head and with a
superb sense of showmanship orders his batman to shoot it off. The
general was shot in the head, but survived to lead his men into battle
with a limp and insane bravery.
There are passages of brilliant narrative, notably of a supply convoy
from Saigon to Phnom Penh running the gauntlet of Khmer Rouge rocket
fire on the Mekong River. Swain's economic, almost laconic, style
conjures vivid images of the eight-month battle for Quang Tri in 1972:
''I remember it now with nostalgia and a glint of terror. Sights and
sounds spin through my head: patrols melting into the wilderness of
misty rain like phantoms from the underworld; the belch of mortar rounds
socking into the mud; straggly lines of refugees trudging down Highway
One; dogs tearing at bodies; the constant rumble of artillery; brave
smiles; helicopters against a darkening sky; the subdued moan of the
wounded in the night; bullets everywhere''.
In a lighter vein, Swain revives the indolent charm of Phnom Penh
before its plunge into the abyss of civil war -- with its brothels and
opium fumeries spinning their fantasies to the tinkling of bells from
Buddhist shrines.
Swain was not the only journalist to be intoxicated by a cocktail of
sex, drugs, and the rock and roll of hi-tech warfare in Indo-China, but
he tells his story better and more frankly than most. His book meanders
and loses its way after he leaves Vietnam and is posted eventually to
Ethiopia, where he is captured by Eritrean guerrillas, but recovers its
momentum when he returns to mourn Cambodia under Vietnamese occupation.
It is an intensely readable book, as one would expect from the man who
won the Journalist of the Year award for his dispatches from Cambodia;
but in the end, one is left feeling vaguely puzzled and dissatisfied. It
is a moving eye-witness account of the death of a country, but it is
little more than that, and it happened a long time ago.
The epilogue leaves us with the image of a man lamenting the romantic
past of Indo-China and becoming sentimental over the ''grand adventure
of death'' that he lived through. For Swain, the river of time has
flowed all too quickly away from the best time of his life.

* THIS was John B Keane's Letters Of A Love Hungry Farmer. Echoes of a
bygone age? Not at all. It's about the plight of the eldest son
inheriting the land and when his mother dies he has to search for a
substitute to help him in rural Ireland. He goes to the annual Marrying
Festival, where 50-something farmers seek ''Wife girls, RC, 25-45, with
a view to matrimony''. The book is very funny and very sad. And, by the

The Blue Flower, Penelope Fitzgerald, Flamingo, #14.99
FRIEDRICH von Hardenberg was born in 1772 and died in 1801. He was a
contemporary of both Goethe and Schiller, who make brief appearances in
this story, which, Penelope Fitzgerald tells us, is based on von
Hardenberg's life ''before he became famous under the name Novalis''.
The text is drawn from ''his surviving work, letters from and to him,
the diaries, and official and private documents'' which were published
between 1960 and 1988, a period almost covering the span of von
Hardenberg's existence.
The novel, therefore, skirts the tantalising boundaries between
fiction and biography. Indeed, many incidents seem to have been lifted
directly from family histories, or the von Hardenberg papers, although
the text is mainly concerned with the love affair between Novalis and
the 12-year-old Sophie von Kuhn, their betrothal and her death three
years after their first meeting.
The action is curiously static and does not fulfil the promise of the
wonderful opening chapter, where the character referred to as Fritz
arrives with a friend on the family washday: '' . . . he could tell from
the great dingy snowfalls of sheets, pillow-cases, bolster-cases, vests,
bodices, drawers from the upper windows into the courtyard where
grave-looking servants, both men and women, were receiving them into
giant baskets, that they washed only once a year''.
The novel has 55 chapters that move through the von Hardenberg family
and circle, glimpsing their domestic and social circumstances and
concentrating on aspects of Fritz's existence rather than offering an
insight into his work.
Novalis believed in a pantheist creation where the spiritual world was
found in everyday objects, that rocks and stones could communicate as
easily as animals or humans. This avenue is never explored, and because
the novel sticks so rigidly to details such as Fritz's work as a manager
of a salt mine, or Sophie's continued illnesses and the terrible bouts
of surgery she was forced to endure, we are forced to wonder how much is
true.
Rather than offering a cohesive whole, the structure offers glimpses
that often leave us wanting more, looking for a development rather than
simply stating details and leaving the reader to make connections which
are not immediately apparent and may not even be there.
For all that the book is beautifully crafted, the focus on incident
rather than character tends to leave an emotional void. And occasionally
the structure is a wee bit rickety. In the chapter called ''An Incident
in Student Life'', Fritz carries a duellist's severed fingers to the
anatomy theatre in his mouth to keep them warm enough to be sewn on.
It could be a brilliant contrivance, but its place in the narrative is
revealed when we are told he thought the incident could be useful to his
companion who wanted to become a doctor, but as a future philosopher, it
didn't help him. Such details do more than authenticate a fanciful text.
They are the foundation on which the book is constructed and, though
many are brief, even intermittent, we have to question their relevance.
''Fritz covered sheet after sheet of paper with schemes for
discovering new lignite beds and improving the supervision of tile-kilns
and lime-kilns, with meteorological records which might help to bring
the refinement of brine to a higher standard, and with notes on the
legal aspect of salt manufacture.'' This smacks of research that could
neither be included nor ignored.
The hallmarks of Penelope Fitzgerald's style are here, yet the novel
lacks the imaginative wholeness we have come to expect. She usually
leaves characters and situations that reverberate long after the book is
completed, poses and explores dilemmas which readers have anguished over
as intensely as if they were their own. Here she is strangely detached,
and Novalis is as obscure as ever.

to be flown home within the next two weeks. She was not treated because
of the risks involved.
Mrs Hankija Skoric, the mother of six-year-old Maja Skoric, said
through an interpreter yesterday: ''She is very, very lucky to have
stayed alive. I am very grateful to the doctors and hospital staff.''
Three of Maja's playmates died in the explosion when a shell landed
close to them in Sarajevo in June.
Shrapnel lodged close to Maja's brain.
Doctors at Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children concluded that
because the tiny fragment adjacent to a vertebra in her neck had become
walled off by scar tissue, it posed only a minimal threat in the future
and it was safer to leave it alone.
The hospital's neuro-surgeons were examining the possibilities of an
operation which could not be contemplated in Sarajevo because of the
lack of equipment.
A hospital statement said surgery to remove the shell fragment could
have involved the risk of destabilising Maja's spine.
The statement said: ''These risks are judged to outweigh clearly the
risk of leaving the fragment.''
Maja and her mother and nine-year-old sister, Adrijana will stay with
members of the Edinburgh Bosnian community for the next fortnight.

THE HOUSING CRISIS
* THE desperate situation in Argyll and Bute has prompted Noel
Feccenda, chair of the district council's housing committee, to call for
a step backwards in the legislation. He wants a lessening of the
requirements on authorities to house homeless people.
Last year, 14% of house lettings in the district were to statutory
homeless people, while in the Oban and Lorn area, the figure was 32%.
''Of course we want people to be housed, but we need more temporary
accommodation because there is a lot of anger among local people who
have been waiting for years for a house when they see someone who has
become homeless getting a house ahead of them,'' he said.
There are 1746 people on the district council waiting-list in Argyll
and Bute and 1541 of them are classed as being in priority need. Just
how long they wait depends on the area. Elderly people on the Cowal
peninsula regularly wait for more than five years for sheltered and
amenity housing. In Campbeltown, they count on four years for a house as
opposed to a flat.
Three and four-apartment houses are at a premium, particularly in
Oban. Last year only eight houses of that size could be allocated to
people from the waiting-list which included 145 priority applications.
On Mull, the concept of waiting-lists has as much meaning as waiting
for a place on a flight to Mars. In some villages, several years will
pass before even one property becomes vacant.
As many as 30% of the private stock and 10% of houses in the public
stock are below the tolerable standard. It is a very serious problem
being tackled by mandatory improvement grants. A local house condition
survey in 1989 found that 7440 houses -- 24% of the total stock --
failed to meet the tolerable standard. Mandatory repair and improvement
grants -- amounting to #4.344m in the current financial year plus a
further #0.288m on discretionary repair and improvement grants -- are
expected to bring a total of 600 houses up to standard in 1995-6.
While the movement of people into the area from elsewhere has
apparently little effect on the demand for council housing, the marked
increase in local house prices in some areas will move some people from
the market-place to the waiting-list. Across the district, sales have
varied from 40.94% of houses in Lorn and the Isles to 16.63% on the
Island of Bute.
Second or holiday homes amount to 12% of the total housing stock,
public and private, according to the district council, whose housing
plan estimates 4040 holiday homes with a further 2260 vacant. The 1991
census, however, found 1732 second residences, 1197 holiday homes, and
2009 vacant.
At last, a major development is moving on site. Oban's biggest ever
housing development (of 166 houses) is a public-private-voluntary
partnership. The district council has already spent #1.2m on buying and
preparing the site, a former quarry at Glenshellach, next to the new
Lorn and Islands district general hospital. It will be developed by
three housing associations, Lorn and Mull, Link Homes, and Bield Homes,
resulting in a mix of houses for rent, shared ownership, and low-cost
home-ownership.

THE HOMELESS
EVEN when someone dies or moves from the island, a homeless family
with children from the mainland will get the house because they have
more points, according to Jenny Parker. She and her husband Sam have
just seven after three-and-a-half years on the waiting-list.
''We put our names down before we got married. We tried to raise a
mortgage but because we were both in seasonal work, the most we could
raise was about #12,000 which is nowhere near the cost of a house.''
On Mull, young couples stay with their parents or move into a caravan
in the backyard. Jenny has lived on the island since she was 14, when
her stepfather, who helped build the island's small-scale railway, was
offered the job of engine-driver. Her mother agreed to swap the
four-bedroom house of her dreams outside Manchester for a cottage on
Mull. Jenny became a weekly boarder at Oban High School and loved it.
A holiday job in one of the island's hotels persuaded her that her
future lay in hotel and catering work. During a succession of hotel and
pub jobs in England, she met her future husband, Sam Parker, from
Sheffield. When Sam's rock band collapsed, they went to Mull for a
holiday to visit Jenny's parents. Sam liked the island so much they
decided to stay on and work during the summer season. Jenny ran a
self-catering complex for one of the hotels, while Sam worked in the
bar.
Home was a caravan which had a fire but no other mod-cons. In winter
the hotel kept Sam on to do odd jobs and Jenny also picked up work where
she could. By the end of their second summer they knew they wanted to
get married, make their home on Mull, and bring up a family. However,
just six weeks before their wedding at the end of October, the hotel
said they could not afford to keep them on. That meant, of course, that
they also lost their caravan as well as six weeks' wages which they had
been counting on for their honeymoon. They had no option but to cancel
that and lose their deposit.
''We were rescued by the Laird of Torosay,'' says Jenny, grateful that
her old friend, Chris James, who owns the Torosay Castle estate, offered
them a winter let in a cottage. ''Since we were both unemployed, we were
able to get housing benefit to pay the rent, but then Sam started
working at the Craignure Inn, which Chris James also owns, and there is
a caravan which goes with the job. I don't want to live in a caravan but
it means we have a home for the whole year.
''As caravans go, it is very good. It is really a mobile home so we
have a spare room as well as a living-room and a bedroom. We have
electricity and hot water, but it gets so damp that we had to throw away
half our clothes which were stored in a spare-room cupboard.
''We have been on the housing list for three-and-a-half years and now
people are asking me why I don't have a child, because that would help
us to get a house. I am not prepared to have a baby in conditions like
this, I think it is morally wrong and I won't do it, but it is very
frustrating when you see other people doing just that to get a house.''
In the last few weeks they have had a glimpse of light at the end of
the tunnel. Jenny's job in the Post Office at Craignure is now full-time
and they have been offered a plot of ground if they can raise a
mortgage. Their hope is that they will qualify for a rural home
ownership grant from Scottish Homes, designed to help people in areas
where there is a housing shortage and no prospect of new houses being
built to alleviate the crisis.

THE LANDOWNER
ANDREW RAVEN says: ''I guess it is a fairly lucky combination to be
living in central Edinburgh, but spending a great deal of time at my
spiritual home in the Highlands. If I was asked where I came from, the
Western Highlands is as close as I get.''
His family owns the Ardtornish Estate, a sizeable chunk of the Morvern
peninsula, but he spends most of his time in Edinburgh working for
Smiths Gore, land managers for the well-heeled and powerful, including
the Crown Estate Commissioners and Scottish Natural Heritage. He
acknowledges that his circumstances are privileged, but feels an
affinity with others forced to leave home in the country to find work.
He embodies the new breed of Scottish landowner, but many of his
concerns for a partnership of public and private interests are mirrored
by the traditional landowners. He sees the White Paper on Rural Scotland
as an opportunity for a much-needed new impetus.
''Rural disadvantage is just as great as urban disadvantage but
because it comes with a pretty picture it has been ignored to an
alarming extent. There is no reason why people in rural areas should
suffer any more disadvantage than people in urban areas and that must
underpin policy. In economic terms, we have a great deal of investment
in the infrastructure and it makes sense to keep people there and using
it,'' he said from the experience of having recently lost two
''outstanding'' members of staff because their children reached
secondary-school age.
There are two options for secondary schooling from Morvern. One is to
travel about two hours -- four hours a day -- to Tobermory; the other is
weekly boarding in Fort William. Neither, admits Raven, is very readily
acceptable to the local people, although he himself was educated in the
English tradition of boarding-school.
There is now a campaign to build a small secondary school in the next
village 20 miles away. It is currently at the bottom of Highland
region's educational budget, but there is hope that EU funding will
boost it to within the forseeable future.
His interest in the environment stems partly from his father's side of
the family, who were passionate amateur naturalists, while professional
theologians and philosophers. It has left him with a profound sense of
the requirements of sustaining both man and nature in the same habitat
to the extent that he devotes a large chunk of his life to ''working
towards preserving communities socially, culturally, and economically''.
He initiated and heads Smiths Gore's natural heritage department which
has expanded and capitalised on their environmental expertise in the
management of large estates.
He describes his objectives on Ardtornish as not dissimilar to those
of the John Muir Trust, best known for buying major estates to preserve
access to the hills. ''It is about conserving wild places for nature and
for people and it is unique among conservation organisations because it
had the foresight 12 years ago to build into its raison d'etre the aim
of conservation while respecting the needs and aspirations of local
people, very bravely trying to set itself a social remit as well as an
environmental remit.
''There are two critical things about access: it is a public benefit
like lighthouses and therefore needs public subvention and it only gets
that in fairly measly measure at the moment. There ought to be
significantly more public funding of access whether it be developing
strategies or repairing footpaths. It is on the up anyway. The other is
the need for education whether of the landowner or of the land-user.''
At Ardtornish, he says, access is not a problem, partly because it is
fairly out of the way for most of the population, and although it is a
sporting estate neither he nor his immediate family have a great
interest in shooting. ''We are economically-driven and might put the
sport/stalking before the access, by asking people to stay off the
hilltops for six weeks in the autumn, but we do give them specific
alternative routes and that is universally accepted by responsible hill
walkers.''
Economic survival depends on diversification, he believes -- and
Ardtornish is more diverse than most. It provides employment directly or
indirectly for half the adult population of the area with 52 full-time
and 27 casual jobs dependent on the estate's resources. The estate and
the farm employ 18 full-time and 12 casual workers between them. An
independently-run sand mine on the land employs 17 and fish farms, which
are also independently run, provide another 14 full-time and 10 casual
jobs.
While arguing that established private ownership and established
public ownership are both ''the right answers in their respective
places'', he is increasingly convinced by voluntary sector organisations
to the extent of arguing for public subsidy of user-ownership drawing on
the crofting model.
''The voluntary groups reflect the public interest in land because it
depends on members' subscriptions as well as public support from SNH or
the National Heritage Memorial Fund. There may be a case for community
involvement in land ownership and we are already beginning to see the
signs of it.''

THE DUKE
THE owner of the largest private landholding in Britain (280,000
acres) boasts of the 200-year tradition of access to his estates. The
Duke of Buccleuch recounts that it was remarked on with amazement 100
years ago and said: ''It is still the case that there are no signs
saying Keep Out or Trespassers will be Prosecuted.''
Despite being confined to a wheelchair after a hunting accident, he
has just joined the Ramblers Association, not to take part in mass
trespasses of private land but to build bridges. ''There are about
100,000 members and only about 2000 of them are real firebrands,'' he
said.
With equal lack of embarrassment, he advocates more public spending on
private land, calling for changes in the tax system to secure the
maintenance of large estates, which he insists are the best model for
balancing farming, forestry, conservation, and rural employment.
A former Conservative MP for Edinburgh North, he unashamedly
criticises the Government for deserting its landed supporters.
''Farmland which is let is classified as being unearned income, whereas
it should be regarded as a business income and taxed on that basis. The
same applies to forestry. We produce 60,000 tonnes of timber a year. It
is a business, but some people think you just plant a tree and come back
in 40 years to cut it down and make a profit,'' he said.
''The need is to keep estates alive and help to secure comprehensive
management of the countryside. Estates used to be 90% of the countryside
or more and now they are 30% or less. It is vital to secure the survival
of those which are still going strong,'' he said.
Part of his claim is based on a survey he carried out among 125 of his
tenant farmers which showed they were in favour of retaining the estate
system. Not quite a repesentative sample perhaps? His Grace replied:
''There was total anonymity, so they could have said absolutely
anything.
''I asked them how they would advise a young man with #100,000 in his
pocket who wanted to go into farming. The advice from 11% was to buy a
farm and borrow more on the strength of it, while 89% said rent a farm.
Of those, 44% inherited their tenancies and 56% became tenants by
application. You can either struggle on a small farm using your own
money or have a decent living on a bigger farm which you rent. The great
majority of farmers are concerned about having a decent lifestyle and of
course they have security of tenure in Scotland. They are the most
protected group there is.
''When asked who their preferred landlord would be, 4% said the state
and 96% said a private company or family.''
One of the advantages of being part of an estate, he added, is being
able to set up joint marketing schemes such as the estate has just done
with its tenant farmers. ''Since 1923, the year I was born, we have run
it as a great big co-op. What profits we do make are ploughed back into
it all, for example, to improve buildings. We are putting central
heating into all our cottages.
''Over and over again we are seeing people taxed out of existence.
There is a very oppressive tax regime on landowning. Landowners were
seen as the main obstacle to local progress at the turn of the century
and the poor old landowner is still regarded as anti-social.
''More than 1000 people are involved in our estates. We make sure our
houses are well-maintained. We have sold a lot of houses and we have
quite a lot of holiday houses but it is necessary to have a stock of
houses because you are never sure when the system of agriculture is
going to change and you will need more people, for example, in
short-rotation forestry.
''We rehouse all our retired employees. If the Ford motor company had
to house its labour force and its retired labour force, the cost of a
Ford motor car would be much higher. The bigger an estate the more you
can afford to have lots of well-qualified management and a specialised
workforce that you can rush them to any particular spot in an emergency.
We even have our own fleet of fire-engines, one on each estate, in case
of woodland fires -- and a fire-engine is very handy if you have blocked
drains.''
The deflection masks a zeal for educating townies about the
countryside. He added: ''When I was an MP for 13 years, I became
conscious of the gap between town and country in understanding of how
the countryside works. In a democracy you hope that the majority views
prevail and if public opinion is as ill-informed as it is at present,
you will get the wrong sort of legislation. We hold both estate and farm
open days and demonstrate all aspects of life in the countryside from
farming to wildlife concerns, the construction and maintenance of
buildings.''
Is he optimistic about the future of the countryside? ''I think the
educational process is leaking through in little bits. Children are more
environmentally conscious but they are still more likely to be taught
about the rain forest than about the woodland five miles down the road
so we also encourage groups to come to study specific aspects such as
tree-planting or red-squirrel conservation.''
Red-squirrel conservation is something of a crusade: his recent
contribution to debate in the Lords was to suggest contraceptives to
curb the population of their grey cousins.

5.

THE VILLAGE SHOPKEEPER
Nostalgia for a rural life and a return to the rhythm of the seasons
has convinced many that abandoning the cities is a worthwhile prospect.
However, as country people are only too aware, the idyll is often light
years from the reality - of scarce housing, minimal bus and train
services and rare shops, banks and libraries. Here, and on the following
pages, Jennifer Cunningham looks at the people who are established on
the land and those who feel they would like to share the dream
THE slightly ramshackle wooden building looks like a traditional
village shop except there are no roses round the door. That is because
it opens on to the A84, where tourists and timber lorries travel bumper
to bumper throughout the summer.
You could call it quaint without offending Helen and Tom Wightman. For
the past five years they have been the hub of Strathyre, a community of
250 folk in the heart of the Trossachs. Now in their sixties, they are a
perfect example of people who drive through picturesque villages on
their summer holidays and begin to picture themselves as country folk.
Tom swapped his job in a sausage factory in Broxburn for an outdoor
life with the Forestry Commission after a caravanning holiday. Now the
couple wouldn't give up life in Strathyre for better security or greater
income in the city, but their message to anyone following their example
is: ''You won't get rich running a village shop''.
''We work seven days a week,'' Helen said. ''In the winter, we are
open from nine to one on Sundays and in the summer from 9am to 4pm but
people seem to keep coming in and sometimes it takes us a while to get
shut.
''We now run the shop entirely by ourselves, because we had help but
found that some of the takings were not going into the till. We had lost
#5000 before we knew exactly what was going on.
''At that point we really thought about giving up but our turnover
would not have allowed us to sell it as a going concern.
''The Post Office is a community one, so we are supposed to be open
only in the mornings, but since it is part of the shop, you can't really
refuse to sell someone a stamp in the afternoon.
''The salary amounts to about #52 a week, which is not a lot for the
responsibility involved.''
Helen is dependent on holidaymakers who like the scenery, watersports,
and legends of the Trossachs. ''If we did not have tourists there
wouldn't be a shop,'' she said. ''I don't make enough on everyday items.
It is only with a few fancy goods like ornaments and tea-towels and mugs
that there is much of a mark-up.
''More and more of the self-caterers bring food with them and just
come to us for bread and milk and perishable things, but three lads who
bought a house in the village recently come nearly every weekend and
bring their pals too. They buy nearly everything here. Maybe men are not
so well-organised.''
Like most village shops, the Wightmans' teeters on the very brink of
existence. It is mainly their sense of duty to the community which has
persuaded them to persevere through every new regulation designed for
modern shops with high turnovers.
''I keep saying to people: use it or lose it,'' Helen said. ''Our
rates rose by one-third in one year. As tenants, we don't even have the
building to sell but we are responsible for the repairs and the district
council expects us to keep it in good order.
''We have a small kitchen which we really use just for our own cups
and plates but we will make up a roll for anyone who asks and the
district council wanted us to put in a second sink. There simply is no
room for another sink. It was an impossible scheme.
''Officials from the district council come and give us advice about
maximising our turnover but they don't understand that you have to carry
slow-turnover items like boot polish because people expect a village
shop to have it when they run out.
''They keep using the word 'viable', but they haven't a clue what a
shop like this is like. Most people go to Callander or Stirling to do
their main shopping and really we are just a convenience, but there are
a lot of elderly people who depend on us and also a lot of good-hearted
people in the village who buy things here because they know we depend on
them.''
The store is also a general repository for medical prescriptions, fish
supplies, and information. Recently, the wife of an elderly man reported
that her husband was having difficulty in getting back down from a
hillwalk. A couple of fit young men were soon dispatched to bring him
down.
Everyone comes to the shop to check on individuals or raise the alarm,
says Helen.
There is now hope that the shop will have a brighter future. Aware of
the difficulties of the wooden building, Stirling District Council has
bought adjacent land for a housing development by Rural Stirling Housing
Association and is now considering building a new shop on the remaining
piece of land.
Tony Cain, the council's development and grants manager, hopes to put
plans before the committee this summer.
''With the addition of 20 houses, we have changed the character of the
village, which previously had houses on only one side of the road, and
it is reasonable that we should add to the amenity of the village,'' Mr
Cain said.''The lease on any new shop will be offered to the current
owners.''
He wants the district council to use all its clout to get an
attractive building. ''It may be only a small shop, but there is no
reason why it should not be a first-class building.''
Like almost all country-dwellers, the Wightmans are convinced they
have a better quality of life than townsfolk. While the work is harder,
the pace of life is more relaxed, they say.
Their two children, Catriona and Kenneth, took to country life like
ducks. They have remained keen to stay in the country, going to
agricultural college at Cupar in Fife, while their classmates sought out
the bright lights of the city. Kenneth, fascinated by sheep since a
neighbouring shepherd commandeered him to help with the lambing, is now
working on a Borders farm.
Catriona joined the RAF and has since married a colleague. She now
lives in Cornwall with her husband and child but they would like to
return to Scotland and have even suggested taking over the shop -- a
dream her parents hold on to for the future.

A MAN who sexually abused children over a 16-year period was jailed
for 10 years yesterday.
Peter Christensen, 62, had denied a string of offences against nine
girls and one boy stretching back to 1979, including one of attempted
rape.
However, after three of his victims had given evidence against him at
the High Court in Edinburgh, Christensen changed his plea and admitted
committing 11 offences between June 1979 and May this year.
One of his victims was four when Christensen, of Giles Street, Leith,
first began abusing her, and the other children were aged between 11 and
13.
Lord Cameron was told that Christensen had invited his victims to his
home where he would ply them with alcohol and show them pornographic
videos before sexually abusing them.
Christensen on one occasion suggested that two of his 11-year-old
victims should have intercourse together.
Mrs Valerie Stacey, Advocate-depute, told the court: ''These young
girls were frightened about what was happening to them and didn't feel
able to go to the authorities at the time.''
She said that one of the victims had to have psychiatric treatment
because of the abuse.
The crimes came to light when one of the victims went to the police.
The court heard that on one occasion after videoing the children,
Christensen decided to erase the tape while they were still in the room.
He did not realise that what he was saying was being recorded on the
tape.
When police replayed the tape they heard him using obscenities and
warning the children not to tell anyone what was happening to them.
Mr Neil Murray QC, defending, said that seldom had there been more
''depressing, perverted, evil and sustained offences'' committed by one
individual.

#20,000 VAT fraud. Airdrie Sheriff Court was told that James Johnston,
42, had committed the fraud after he had left the police force to set up
a security company.
The company, called Scorpion Security, provided watchmen and dogs to
guard building sites.
However, over an 18-month period from July 1990 until December 1991,
Johnston falsified VAT returns to ease cash-flow problems caused by a
fall in business.
Johnston, of Kingsley Court, Uddingston, bowed his head as Sheriff
Robert Dickson told him: ''This was a slide into dishonesty.''
The court heard Scorpion lost around #100,000 to customers who went
bust, and Johnston was declared bankrupt in September 1992. The VAT
fraud was uncovered by Hamilton inspectors in 1991.
Johnston, formerly an Uddingston policeman, was fined #1500 in 1992
after one of Scorpion's employees died in a blaze while on duty.
Mr James McIntyre, 16, died in the fire at a turnstile while working
at the Broomfield stadium, former home of Airdrie Football Club.

AN extra #2.1m is to be provided by the Scottish Office for an
expansion in respite care, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton announced
yesterday.
The Scottish Health Minister said: ''To enable more vulnerable people
to live in the community, there is a need for appropriate respite care
to be available.
''While the NHS will continue to meet people's short-term health care
needs, hospitals are not the appropriate place to offer respite care to
people whose needs are primarily social.
''I believe nursing homes can make an important contribution to the
provision of respite care, offering a break for carers and providing a
positive experience for those being cared for in a homely setting, but
with the support of appropriately trained staff.''
The #2.1m was intended to ''encourage authorities to adopt contractual
arrangements which will assist private and voluntary sectors in the
provision of respite care''.
In a robust defence of Government policy, the Minister told a
conference hosted by the Registered Nursing Home Association in Scotland
that claims the Government's community care programme was underfunded
were completely unjustified.
''Since the inception of the reforms, local authorities have benefited
from substantial new resources which now stand at a cumulative #241m.
This includes the transfer of #158m from the Department of Social
Security which has enabled authorities to assume overall responsibility
for the purchase of social care, particularly with regard to the
placements in the residential sector, including nursing homes.''

<HEADLINE>Army tactic for Gurkhas to step into the breach</HEADLINE>

THE Defence Ministry is planning to use up to 400 Gurkhas as
shock-troops on the cheap to fill gaps in key fighting units such as the
Parachute Regiment.
The Army as a whole is 1200 men short of its recruiting target for
this year.
The Nepalese soldiers are paid up to 40% less than their British
counterparts under a deal imposed by the Indian Government in 1949.
India also recruits Gurkha regiments and demanded that the wage scales
for the two armies be kept the same to prevent Britain poaching the best
candidates.
Gurkha regiments in UK service are currently being reduced from 7500
men to just 2500 under Treasury-led plans to trim the armed forces'
manpower bill.
Despite the slimdown, competition for a place in the British Army
remains fierce. When recruiting teams visit Nepal, there are more than
400 candidates for each available place.
Britain has traditionally tried to get round the pay agreement by
paying the Gurkhas overseas' living and other allowances. However, they
still earn well below the normal rate of up to #263 a week.
The proposal to transfer Gurkhas to other units to make up the
shortfall in numbers was given a cautious welcome by the men of the 3rd
Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles at their base near Aldershot yesterday.
Most felt it was preferable to being made redundant.
Their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Pearson, said: ''My
first reaction is one of delight. But I would like to know more about
it. Most of my men would be sad at having to give up their distinctive
regimental identity and possibly their Kukri fighting knives.''
After cutting Army strength from 153,000 to 119,000, the Army now
finds itself short of infantry, although there is a surplus of recruits
for technical and specialist branches.
The Paras are particularly badly affected, with a shortfall of 250 men
for its three battalions.
More than 250,000 Gurkhas served in the British forces during the
Second World War.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns and many first team players joined mourners
at the funeral of 16-year-old Mark Scott yesterday.
Mark, a fifth-year pupil at Glasgow Academy and a keen Celtic
supporter, died after being stabbed in a Glasgow street after the club's
game against Partick Thistle last Saturday.
The mourners, who included hundreds of school friends, heard Father
Gerard Tartaglia tell the service at St Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church
in Merrylee, Glasgow, that Mark had ''lived as a member of a family
blessed with loving parents, brothers, and sisters''.
He added: ''His short life was a good one with a potential that was
beginning to be realised.''
Mark, from Newlands, Glasgow, died after an incident outside a public
house in London Road. A 22-year-old man has been charged in connection
with his death.

A MINER killed underground by a huge release of oil and gas fumes met
his death after running back to fetch his tools, according to
colleagues.
Two fellow workers told the authorities that contractor Andrew
Fielding, 39, was running away from the lethal cocktail of fumes when he
realised he had left his tool bag behind.
He ran back to fetch it and was overcome by the fumes.
The two employees of a machinery supply firm, JOY Manufacturers, were
released from hospital yesterday after treatment for the effects of
noxious fumes.
The men were developing a new roadway 650 metres underground at
Thoresby Colliery, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Thursday.
The pit is owned privately by the R J Budge firm.
Colleagues of Mr Fielding, of Sheffield, yesterday observed a minute's
silence before returning to work.
Mr Paddy Tipping, Labour MP for Sherwood, said Mr Fielding's
colleagues cheated death by reaching an air duct and gulping in oxygen.
Mr Fielding leaves a wife and two daughters.

THE YOUNG FARMERS
* AUSTRALIA, New Zealand, Canada, and Africa all hold more immediate
appeal than Scotland in the post-exam plans of agricultural students.
Only one of a random group of six on agriculture courses at the
Scottish Agricultural College's Auchincruive campus outside Ayr was
beginning the hunt for a job. Stuart Dempsie is from an Ayrshire
dairy-farming family. He found his future knocked on the head when plans
to expand the family business, by taking on the tenancy of another
360-acre farm, fell through because they could not increase their milk
quota. With one branch of the family farming in Canada, he has
considered going there but will first try to find a reasonably-paid job
at home.
To boost his chances, he has just completed a two-year HND course in
agriculture. His concern now is earning a reasonable income.
Agricultural workers have been grossly underpaid, even when profits were
high, he said, and claims that he would think the same even if he were
the employer.
That caused his fellow students to say they would all like to work for
him, but no-one else is yet actively looking for farm work.
Lorna Speirs may go for a job related to agriculture in the Civil
Service, hoping to spend time outside with animals rather than in an
office. She believes farming is in her blood. Without enough Highers to
get into vet school, she studied beauty therapy before doing a series of
office jobs and now thinks she could combine the skills she developed
with her new agricultural knowledge. She is one of the most confident
about the future of agriculture: ''People have to eat and the only place
that food is really produced is on farms. Farming used to be a family
way of life, but now it is really a business,'' she added, defending the
amount of financial and management training in the course, which is
criticised by fellow-students.
At 38 and with two young daughters, Campbell Love has decided that his
family is likely to have a better future in Australia and has just
completed a one-year course at the college to gain some technical
expertise before he goes. The family farm in Ayrshire has been sold to
an open-cast mining company. That was something previous generations of
the family tried, but at that time there were very strict limits on
open-cast workings which made it uneconomic. Now that restrictions have
been relaxed, their land's coal reserves are worth more than its
agricultural potential and Campbell's parents are emigrating too. They
intend to raise beef cattle in Australia.
Voluntary Service Overseas interests Bruce Charter, who is about to
move from the HND course to a degree in which he will be able to
concentrate on his particular interest of crop husbandry. If he does not
do VSO, he hopes to work in research rather than farming. ''I'm far too
lazy to be a farmer,'' he said.
Heather Sinclair is not from a farming family but has spent all her
spare time helping on friends' farms since she was a child. A year ago
she had her sights set on farm management. At the end of a two-year HND
course in agriculture she's no longer sure and her most likely next move
is to take a year out -- possibly with relatives in New Zealand -- to
consider her options.

THREE men accused of shooting an innocent bystander during an
underworld feud were cleared of murder yesterday.
The target of the attack in Craigneuk, Lanarkshire, on August 25 last
year was Mr Alan Murdoch, 29, who was shot in the leg.
Mr Douglas Bryce, 21 died after being shot as he helped Mr Murdoch
start his car. Mr Bryce bled to death after a 9mm bullet went through
his neck, nicking his jugular vein.
Yesterday at Glasgow High Court, the three men accused of the murder
of Mr Bryce and the attempted murder of Mr Murdoch, were acquitted after
an eight-day trial. They were Mr William Longmire, 32, of The Broadway,
Craigneuk, Mr John McNeil, 27, of Heathfield, Wishaw, and Mr Derek
McCreaddie, 19, of Tinto Crescent, also Wishaw.
Mr Longmire and Mr McNeil lodged a special defence claiming that Mr
Murdoch had shot Mr Bryce. There were suggestions he had then turned the
gun on himself.
Mr Longmire and Mr McNeil were also acquitted of the attempted murder
of Mr Murdoch's brother, William, 32, outside his former home at
Golfhill Road, Craigneuk, on May 3 last year.
The jury heard how a car drove slowly past Mr William Murdoch's home
and shots were fired into it, narrowly missing two children and a family
friend.
Mr Alan Murdoch claimed the shot which injured him and killed Mr Bryce
also came from a slow moving car. Police ballistic experts said the same
gun had been used in both incidents.
The judge, Lord Dawson, also heard allegations that the Murdoch family
had terrorised local people. Each of three brothers, Alan, William, and
John, 35, had been shot.

JIMI HENDRIX SESSIONS, John McDermott, Litte Brown, #20
* AS its title states, Jimi Hendrix Sessions is a 196-page tome
providing day-by-day listings of the gipsy axe-icon's creative
endeavours in sundry recording studios between 1963 and his premature
death on September 18, 1970.
Granted access to tape libraries, and assisted anecdotally by
Hendrix's former bassist, Billy Cox, and one of his engineers, Eddie
Kramer, John McDermott provides as much information as any
Hendrix-trainspotter could wish to know.
For example, Foxey Lady (sic) was recorded at CBS Studios in London on
Tuesday, December 13, 1966 in three hours between 4pm and 7pm (no
daytime recording: it upset the studio's New Bond Street neighbours).
One of Hendrix's earliest pre-fame recordings as a sessions-guitarist
ended up on a Jayne Mansfield single.
His last studio session was on August 24, 1970, at Electric Lady
studio in New York. Having seen it with my own eyes, I know that the
Electric Lady mixing-desk pictured on p151 (upon which the Electric
Ladyland album was recorded) is now in the New Orleans studio owned by
U2 collaborator Daniel Lanois, located in a house which featured in the
movie Angel Heart . . . help!
I have now been smitten with trivia-itis, too! 'Scuse me, while I kiss
my marbles goodbye.
But what's in all this for us regular pop-pickers who simply like the
cut of Hendrix's afro and the sensual luxuriance of his guitar-playing?
Not a lot.
Rather than reading the book's words, we'll actually absorb more about
Hendrix from looking at the book's pictures of rock'n'roll's most
electric faux-naif. Oh, and from listening to his records.

RICHARD DAVENPORT-HINES: AUDEN: Heinemann: #20
W. H. AUDEN. AS I WALKED OUT ONE EVENING. Faber, #12.99
THE publisher puffs Richard Davenport-Hines's Auden with two
questionable comments. First, we are told Auden was the greatest English
poet of the twentieth century which goes easy on fans of the American
Eliot, the Irish Yeats, the Welsh Dylan Thomas, the Scottish MacDiarmid
but may come as bad news to fans of Auden's fellow Englishmen Hardy,
Lawrence, and Larkin. Second, we are told this biography makes use of a
mass of new material but when we want new information it is not always
forthcoming as, for example, when Davenport-Hines writes of Auden's
engagement of 1928: ''he became engaged to marry a nurse called Shielah
Richardson (about whom little is known)''.
As Auden's sexual identity is the subject of much discussion in the
biography it would have been good of Davenport-Hines to ask questions
about Sheilah Richardson. Something must be known about her as she was a
nurse with a name but Davenport-Hines has nothing new to add to Auden's
engagement. Many questions remain unanswered.
Auden ended his poem The Unknown Citizen with two questions and an
ironic observation: ''Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd.
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard''. Was Auden
free? Free enough to marry one Mann (Erika, daughter of Thomas) to
provide her with a British passport and an escape from Nazi persecution;
free to love several men including Chester Kallman with whom he lived in
Austria and elsewhere.
Was Auden happy? Contented with his published work but often unhappy
in his private life. Davenport-Hines writes of Auden's depression and
self-destructive drinking and a taxing problem which Kallman believed
hastened his death. Confronted with a tax demand from the Austrian
Fiscus, Auden decided to leave Austria and return to Oxford but died of
heart failure in Vienna on September 28, 1973, after a poetry reading.
Of his own existence he remarked: ''I was glad I could be unhappy''.
I was glad I met Auden twice in the 1960s. Once in Milne's Bar,
Edinburgh, where he sat smiling in his slippers and his cups, then
started serenading Stevie Smith who was not waving but downing her drink
in grand style. Both poets pretended to be radiantly happy in the pub
and when they left it to read their poems in public. (Auden, of course,
knew Scotland well: he taught at Larchfield Academy, Helensburgh, from
1930-32 and while in Helensburgh wrote The Orators, his most
ostentatiously obscure composition.)
The second time I met Auden was in London in 1967. Again he was at
large to perform in public. After his reading at the Poetry
International Festival, I found him alone and lonely in a quiet corner
of a literary party. In his poem about poetry reading, On the Circuit,
Auden had written about the need to have an ''analeptic swig'' to keep
him going.
At this party he had clearly had quite a few analeptic swigs of whisky
but all was not going well as he objected to other performers. He
disliked the confessional poetry of Anne Sexton though he had written
intimately autobiographical poems in the past. He deplored the communist
poetry of Pablo Neruda though he had published a poem entitled A
Communist to Others in 1933.
In that poem, which he branded as ''trash'' when he decided to
distance himself from dogmatically political poetry, Auden attacked a
certain kind of poet: ''Unhappy poet, you whose only/Real emotion is
feeling lonely/When suns are setting''. There Auden was indulging in
Freudian projection, attributing to an anonymous other, a condition he
recognised in himself. He was that kind of poet, as is evident even in
the supposedly light verse selected by Edward Mendelson for As I Walked
Out One Evening: ''Love made him weep his pints like you and me'';
(Who's Who) ''Your lamp is out and all the cages still''; (Madrigal)
''Thousands are still asleep,/Dreaming of terrifying monsters''; (Night
Mail) ''In headaches and in worry/Vaguely life leaks away''; (As I
Walked Out One Evening).
Auden was addicted to emotion. And to other things. He was a
homosexual who smoked at least 15,000 fags a year. He was a boozer who
had to binge. He was addicted to amphetamines for a long period as
Davenport-Hines recalls rather moralistically when writing of Auden's
brave attempt to stop taking Benzedrine: ''Socially, for such a shy man
. . . the strain of conversation without his bennies could have been
agonising. Without them he depended instead, like Kallman, far too
heavily on alcohol . . . In the last decade of his life, Auden became
lonelier, more unhappy and vulnerable, seemed indeed to enter a physical
decline''.
If Auden deteriorated physically, his mind still remained alert to
what I regard as the main theme of his poetry.
The theme is simply stated in the penultimate quatrain of Doggerel by
a Senior Citizen, the final poem in Mendelson's selection: ''I've true
friends''. Auden was arguably the finest modern English poet to write
about friendship. In September 1, 1939 (another political poem Auden
trashed as ''trash'') he affirmed that ''no-one exists alone''. From the
beginning of his career as a poet, companionship was the key to his
creativity.
Poems (1930), Auden's first commercially published collection,
confessed to a need to search the night ''for a companion/Dreamed of
already'' and the quest continued for a poet who explored all aspects of
friendship from casual acquaintance to agape.
Since he was homosexual, Auden was after an ideal companion he called
''the truly strong man'' in a passage composed in April 1939: ''And
recent particulars come to mind . . . But always with success of others
for comparison,/The happiness, for instance, of my friend Kurte
Groote,/Absence of fear in Gerhart Meyere/From the sea, the truly strong
man.''
Auden thought Eden -- The Just City he mentioned in New Year Letter
(1941) -- was life with a truly strong man but Kallman, his closest
companion, was not strong as Auden often lamented. In June 1963 he
wrote: ''Chester, poor lamb, is utterly miserable, which doesn't make it
so easy for me to be cheerful either''. Instead of a truly strong man,
Auden was stuck with a poor lamb.
Davenport-Hines is a sympathetic biographer who worries about Auden's
dependence on Kallman, poor lamb, who ''would sit up drinking until the
early hours, talking miserably of his wasted life and describing its
latest indignities''. Poor Auden, who had to put up with the poor lamb.
Yet Davenport-Hines's account of Auden's highly personal later work, so
often dismissed by critics attached to the early mildly political work,
is an impressively thoughtful tribute to a poet who went from strength
to strength.
Auden himself was the truly strong man.

The Oxford Book of Creatures, edited by Jacqueline Sims, Oxford
University Press, #17.99
* ANTHOLOGIES are the fad of the nineties, but this one is rather
sweet. It's a compilation of poetry and prose, ancient and modern,
devoted entirely to things that swim, creep, graze, and fly. Arrangement
is by theme -- ''Procreation'', ''Habitat'', ''Red in Tooth and Claw'',
and similarly self-explanatory headings -- and the excerpts are indexed
by author.
The book is accessible and, in these mean times, there's a lot of it
for your money -- 387 pages, with print small but legible, and a good
deal more text than a contemporary Jeffrey Archer. The range of authors
covers all you might expect -- Aesop, Kenneth Grahame, Henry David
Thoreau -- and a good many you wouldn't: Primo Levi, Horace Walpole,
Pliny the Elder.
Most of us are big on animal stories when we are young, and for such
the book is rather an exercise in nostalgia. Old friends pop up from
nowhere, excerpts from tales read many years ago. You forget how well
Kipling could write about a mongoose killing a snake. And, on being
reminded of it, you want to dash out into the streets and demand, with
all the force of law, that children be denied every conceivable stimulus
until they have read E B White's Charlotte's Web.
Anthologies always disappoint, of course, in what they omit. I'd like
at least one of Gavin Maxwell's contributions not to have come from Ring
of Bright Water -- how about his powerful description of a burdened ant
in Raven Seek that Brother? -- and Red in Tooth and Claw is the poorer
for lacking Rousseau's deliciously dark thoughts on death by octopus.
A bedside tome, this, to be dipped into when you want to curl up in
bed like a small furry animal.

THE FOOTBALLER
Field of dreams and occasionally disasters: Gavin Bell and
photographer Edward Jones continue their series of portraits of Scots
and their life at work, rest, and play
WHEN Andy Roddie goes to work, thousands of people watch his every
move. Some observe him with a thrill of anticipation, others with fear
and loathing. If he performs well, his admirers roar their approval. If
he falters, they groan in disappointment, and if he is having a bad day
sometimes they hurl abuse at him.
Whatever he does, it is noted, discussed, and analysed long after he
has knocked off and gone home; and next day formal verdicts are
pronounced in the newspapers. There is no escape from the glare of
publicity and controversy, for Andy is a professional footballer.
It is a curious life played out on a field of dreams. There is glamour
and excitement in enacting a Roy of the Rovers fantasy cherished by
millions of wee boys, but there are intense pressures and anxieties and
a profound insecurity that would be intolerable in most other
professions.
At best, the career of a top-level footballer lasts less than 20
years. It can be cut short at any time by serious injury, loss of form,
or the arrival of a more talented player. For the stars, fame and
fortune wisely invested may bring substantial rewards when their playing
days are over. For others, advancing years bring a transfer to a smaller
club, a loss of earnings and prestige, and a gradual slide into
obscurity. Roddie, against all the laws of common sense, loves his job
and can't imagine a better way of earning a living.
''It has its ups and downs, of course, but when you're playing well
it's a great life,'' he says. ''Sometimes I have to remind myself how
lucky I am to be earning a good wage for something I enjoy doing.''
We are driving through Lanarkshire, heading for his place of work at
Fir Park, Motherwell. The skies are clear after overnight rain, the air
is fresh and bracing, and Roddie is looking forward to a hard training
session. ''It's a grand day for a work-out,'' he says.
He was probably fated to be a footballer from the day he began kicking
a ball around the backstreets of Linthouse in Glasgow. His father played
in the same amateur youth team as a certain Alex Ferguson, now the
manager of Manchester United. It came as no surprise to Bobby Roddie
when his son's talent was spotted at the age of 13 by an Aberdeen scout,
who promptly recruited him to the club's schoolboy squad.
Three years later, Andy was invited to sign a contract to play for
Aberdeen for #125 a week -- by Alex Ferguson. The option of staying on
at Govan High School to sit 0 levels was never seriously considered.
After six years at Aberdeen, he was transferred to Motherwell a year
ago for a fairly modest #135,000 which reflected his promise rather than
proven ability. At 23, Andy is not a recognised star, even in the
limited Scottish galaxy, but he may be on the verge of becoming one. He
is small and fast, he bemuses defenders with darting runs reminiscent of
an old-fashioned winger, and he is beginning to impress the critical
home support at Fir Park.
But he knows that every time he touches the ball in a match he is
being judged by self-appointed experts who demand perfection and are
quick to deride anything less. ''It's frustrating sometimes,'' he
admits. ''Like in any job, you don't need somebody to tell you when
things are going wrong. You know yourself. When you're playing well,
everything falls into place. It's when you're going through a bad patch
that you need the fans on your side, not on your back. When they're
shouting and bawling, you just have to try and block them out.''
There are no fans at the stadium when the players arrive for a midweek
training session. The big stands are silent and empty, and shafts of
autumn sunlight play undisturbed among shadows in the corridors and
stairwells. There are ghosts in the players' lounge -- young men in
old-fashioned football shirts, and officials with cloth caps and serious
expressions, gazing out from fading photographs -- the Motherwell team
of 1909-10. The team that won the old First Division and toured South
Africa in 1931 is there, along with their successors who won the
Scottish Cup 20 years later.
Alan Dick, the club secretary, says times have changed. ''The days
when you could shout down a pit and get three provisional players are
long gone. This is a depressed area now.'' He thinks players are fitter
and faster than before, but modern tactics have stifled individual
flair. ''Still, every kid in the streets round here wants to be a
footballer or a pop star. That will go on.''
At the training ground, a public park on the banks of the Clyde in
Hamilton, three wee boys in Motherwell strips are kicking a ball around
when their heroes arrive in minibuses painted in the team colours of
claret and amber. To their delight, one of the first-team players
strolls over and joins them for a few minutes. It's hard to tell who is
enjoying it most, the children or the professional.
The reserve players are being put through their paces by Jim Griffin,
a member of the 1991 Scottish Cup-winning team whose playing career was
ended by a knee injury last year. He is grateful to the club for keeping
him on in a coaching capacity, but when he asked what he misses most
about playing, he says: ''Everything''.
Roddie is a level-headed young man with a pragmatic approach to his
work that helps him cope with its pitfalls. ''You have to accept that
all kinds of things can go wrong. But I've been brought up to see
problems as a kind of test you have to pass to become a better player
and person. If things aren't going well you just have to grit your teeth
and get through it. You don't become a bad player overnight.''
He adds, however, that there is a very fine line between a good player
and a mediocre player -- in other words between success and failure.
''Confidence is vital. If you believe in yourself, you can do anything.
Or at least you think you can, which is just as important.''
Alex McLeish, the Motherwell manager and former Scottish
internationalist, agrees. ''A footballer's highs and lows are much more
extreme than the average punter's. The best thing in football is
winning. Winning is absolutely everything. The worst is losing. When you
lose, you're full of self-doubt and recrimination.'' But on balance, he
says, it's a tremendous life. ''Even the pressure is like a drug. It's
hard to live without it.''
After a gruelling speed endurance session in the morning, the
first-team squad returns to the training ground after lunch to practise
ball skills. There is rough humour and laughter as a fusillade of
crosses and shots whizzes around a goalmouth.
''Come across, Andy,'' a player shouts. Andy does, collects a pass,
and shoots low and hard beneath the advancing goalkeeper. ''Nice finish,
Andy,'' the manager says. Another player shouts: ''How d'ye no' dae that
on Saturday, ya wee b . . . ''
There is camaraderie among the players, although they all know it is
tenuous, that today's team-mate could be tomorrow's adversary. Unlike
the supporters, who tend to remain loyal to a single club, the players
are mercenaries who may have to change teams to advance their careers.
Roddie explains: ''You feel a sense of loyalty to your club, because
they're giving you a chance to earn a decent living. But at the end of
the day you're playing for money to support your family as well as for
cups and trophies. If somebody offers a player a better contract, he has
to consider it.''
Family is important to Roddie, and no matter what happens at a match
he tries not to take his work home with him. ''My wife looks forward to
weekends, because Saturday nights are about the only time we can go out
for a meal and a few drinks. So even if I'm hurting inside because I
didn't get a game, or we got beat, I try not to let it show.''
The fact that he is a footballer doesn't show at all in his home. None
of his trophies or youth international caps is on display in his new
bungalow near Paisley. A framed print in the hall, featuring a violin
and a clarinet, sets a classical tone far removed from the baying mayhem
of Roddie's usual workplace. ''OK, football's my life, but I don't see
why I should force it on other people,'' he says.
His wife Vicki, who is expecting their first child, appreciates having
a man who comes home early from work, ready to take her shopping or for
a drive in the countryside. She is less enamoured of football crowds
that jeer him on occasion, but accepts this part of their life
philosophically: ''I sit and cringe at what people say sometimes, but
there's not a lot I can do about it. When they shut up I give him a
cheer, because I know how important it is to him.''
Providing he can steer clear of serious injury, Roddie hopes to have
up to 12 years left in the game at top level. But when the final whistle
blows on his playing career, he will be ready to hang up his boots. ''I
wouldn't want to stay in the game. I think the pressures on the coaching
side must be even greater, and at that stage I think Vicki and I would
be wanting to relax a bit more and enjoy life.'' This might entail
buying a hotel or a restaurant, to employ Roddie's other skill as a
cook.
Meantime, he is happy with what he does for as long as it lasts. After
training the sun is still shining, and Roddie says: ''I enjoy this bit,
driving home, feeling good, thinking about the next game.'' Asked if
there is something he wants in life that he doesn't have, he reflects
for a moment and says: ''You've got me there, I think.''

HUMAN brain cells grown in frog spawn are helping scientists
understand how women can plunge from the serenity of pregnancy to the
despair of post-natal depression.
The research by Dundee University scientists is one of five projects
at a #1m Neuro Sciences Institute which will open at Ninewells Hospital
on Thursday. The institute, backed by Scottish Enterprise Tayside and
Drug Development (Scotland), will add weight to Dundee's growing renown
as a world centre for scientific and medical research.
It is based at the Department of Pharmacology at Ninewells, and will
employ 35 scientific and technical staff in its first year. This is
expected to expand to 60 and it is thought the centre will generate some
#3m of research income for the university over the next five years.
Yesterday, the co-directors, Professors Jerry Lambert and David
Nicholls, spoke about the work they are leading in one of the last
frontiers of medical discovery. Pharmaceutical companies are already
standing by to translate the research into marketable drugs.
The frog spawn is part of a project by Professor Lambert and Dr John
Peters, who have been in the forefront of research over the past 10
years into naturally occurring steroids in the brain which tend to
control mood.
The steroids magnify the flow of the neuro-transmitter, gaba, whose
functions include curbing anxiety, sedating, stopping convulsions, and
inducing sleep. There are already drugs which mimic these functions,
including tranquillisers, anti-epileptic, and barbiturate-based
anaesthetic agents.
But they have side-effects, and Professor Lambert said:
''Pharmaceutical companies are interested in producing analogues of
these steroids. Because they are naturally produced in and around the
brain, the hope is that such drugs would have a better side-effect
profile. Abnormally high levels develop in women during pregnancy and
exert a calming influence. After birth, they drop dramatically so
post-natal depression is one of the areas of interest, as is
pre-menstrual tension, since the levels vary throughout the month.''
Professor Nicholls's work is aimed at minimising the damage caused by
stroke, much of which occurs as a result of the actions of glautamate,
an excitatory transmitter through which nerves communicate with each
other.
''A lot of the damage which occurs in stroke happens when glautamate
leaks out of the dying cells at the site of the stroke and starts
attacking otherwise healthy cells in the surrounding area,'' he said.
''Millions of pounds are being spent round the world with the goal of
finding a substance which ambulancemen or paramedics could give stroke
victims on the spot before they are removed to hospital.''
One of their colleagues, Dr Kieran Breen, and his team are trying to
find a reliable blood test to detect people who might develop
Alzheimer's disease.
Genetic testing can already identify a small proportion of Alzheimer
candidates who might be at increased risk of the inherited version of
the disease, but so far nothing clinical can be done for them.
What Dr Breen hopes to find is some substance, probably a protein,
which might be involved in the development in all forms of the disease.
Other projects are a study of molecular basis of drug dependancy, led
by Dr David Balfour, and research led by Dr Lesley Sutherland into
genetic defects in the brain.
The university's department of biochemistryis rated one of the best in
the UK and is soon to be home to the #20m Wellcome Sciences Institute,
while its biomedical research centre has a pioneering reputation for
research into environmental causes of cancer.

A SCOTTISH couple have returned from China after adopting a little
girl from an orphanage in the southern province of Jiangxi.
Teachers Brigitta Murray and Simon Rhodes, both 38, from East Linton,
had only a photograph of five-month-old Ailan before they were given the
go-ahead by the Chinese authorities.
It is believed Ailan is the first Chinese child to be legally adopted
and brought to Scotland. She is settled in to her new home and both
parents are said to be ''over the moon''.
The couple decided to adopt after five years' trying to have a child
of their own. They first looked at the possibility of adopting in
Britain but that was ruled out.
They decided to look at China, where the rules of adoption are strict
and insist that adopting couples must be aged over 35.
In China, there is a strict rule of one child per family and many
babies, particularly girls, are abandoned.

A CORONATION Street actor won his appeal against a ban for driving
without insurance yesterday.
Simon Gregson, 20, who plays Steve McDonald in the Granada TV series,
also had a #400 fine quashed when he produced a valid insurance
certificate at Manchester Crown Court.
However, he abandoned an appeal against a conviction for speeding at
70mph in a 40mph zone in his BMW 525i on January 16 this year.
Magistrates in Stockport had banned Gregson for a year in August, and
also fined him #155 for speeding, #65 for having no MoT certificate, and
#45 for failing to produce a driving licence.
The Crown did not oppose Gregson's appeal on the insurance charge
after the insurance certificate was produced.
The actor, of Thornton Road, Heald Green, Stockport, who represented
himself, had to testify in the witness box that his licence, which he
said he had lost, had only six penalty points.
The court was told the three points imposed for speeding would take
him to nine points, three below the level at which he would be
disqualified.
Judge Christopher Tetlow said he would take evidence about the licence
from Gregson, who appeared under his real name of Simon Alan Gregory.
Gregson told the judge: ''The licence has six points. It was for
letting someone drive my car who wasn't insured.''
Costs of #40 from the original hearing were ordered to stand. Gregson
made no comment as he left the court.

FATHER'S Day killer Steven McGowan was jailed for life yesterday for
the murder of his former partner, nursing sister Irene Duffy, in her
ward at Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow.
McGowan, the hospital's electrician, stabbed and slashed the
32-year-old nurse 41 times with a hunting knife in a brutal attack at
her nursing station on ward 2a.
Auxiliary nurse Mrs Dorothy Cunningham, 48, a trial witness, told the
court how she ran screaming for help after crawling around McGowan's
feet as he rained blows down upon Ms Duffy.
After a five-day trial, the jury rejected McGowan's defence that he
was guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide because of
diminished responsibility and found him guilty of murder.
The court heard that McGowan had subjected Ms Duffy to death threats
for months after the break-up of their 10-year relationship. He claimed
he finally snapped after being denied access to their son Christopher,
three, on Father's Day, June 18, and the revelation that Ms Duffy was
seeing another man.
However, the court was told that McGowan had threatened Ms Duffy
saying: ''Your time is nearly up,'' while drawing his finger across his
throat, and had asked her: ''Have you picked the lining for your coffin
yet?'' Despite this, he claimed he had not planned to carry out the
threats.
The trial judge, Lord Hamilton, told the jury he would be commending a
witness, Mr Ian McDonald, to the Crown authorities in recognition of his
bravery.
Lord Hamilton said: ''Mr McDonald showed a great deal of courage.''
Mr McDonald, 47, a civil engineer of Kilsyth Road, Kirkintilloch, had
managed to drive McGowan from his attack by knocking him over with a
steel trolley.
Mr McDonald, who had only recently moved from North Uist in the Outer
Hebrides, told how he pinned blood-splattered McGowan against a wall and
asked him: ''What are you playing at?'' McGowan told police as he was
being handcuffed: ''She wouldn't let me see my wee boy and it's Father's
Day today.''
Defence QC Gordon Jackson, had argued in the High Court in Glasgow
that doctors had said that McGowan was bordering on insanity at the time
of the killing and was not legally responsible for his actions.
The jury heard days of medical evidence from psychiatrists as to
McGowan's mental state at the time of the murder.
However, Advocate-depute Ronald Clancy asked a defence psychologist:
''Could it not simply be that he was angry and hated her?'' Reply: Yes.
Mr Clancy said there had been no evidence that rows over access were
Ms Duffy's fault.
In fact, he said, Ms Duffy, of Glenacre Road, Cumbernauld, did not
oppose McGowan's access application in court and he had his son three
days a week and every alternative weekend.
Pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy had told the High Court in Glasgow that
Ms Duffy was the victim of a ''sustained and vicious attack'' with stab
wounds to her heart, liver, lungs, throat, head, face, and other parts
of her body.
Ms Duffy had cuts and stabs to her arms and hands where she tried in
vain to defend herself.
After the attack, she pleaded with doctors: ''Please don't let me die
. . .''
However, she died as surgeons fought in vain to stem the massive blood
loss from her multiple wounds.
McGowan, of Meadowburn, Bishopbriggs, told the jury he shared access
to his three-year-old son Christopher with Ms Duffy after she left him
17 months earlier for student nurse Patrick Gordon, 31.
On the day he killed her, he claimed he had got a phone call from his
son who said ''Hello, daddy,'' before the telephone clicked off.
He further claimed he had no memory of walking for 25 minutes to the
hospital and stabbing Ms Duffy. McGowan said he ''came round'' standing
with the blood-covered knife in his hand and Ms Duffy lying dying at his
feet.
McGowan said he was ''devastated'' when Ms Duffy left him and he later
learned she was having an affair with someone else.
Psychiatrists called by the defence said that they diagnosed McGowan
as suffering from reactive depression because of his split with Ms Duffy
and problems over access to their son.
However, Mr Clancy said Ms Duffy had not opposed McGowan's application
in court for access or caused any of the unpleasantness.
McGowan was to have custody of the boy the day after the murder.
The child is now being looked after by Ms Duffy's parents in
Cumbernauld, and McGowan's parents in Bishopbriggs.
After the verdict, Mrs Cunningham, the auxiliary nurse who witnessed
the murder, said: ''McGowan should be hanged for what he did.''

SCOTLAND'S biggest univer-
sity is looking for a new chancellor.
Sir Alec Cairncross who has been chancellor at the University of
Glasgow for 23 years will retire next February. The university today
announces in The Herald that nominations for a successor must be
received by November 24.
Nominations can be made by a proposer and seconder from the
university's General Council, which represents graduates and staff.
If more than one nomination is received there will be a postal
election involving council members, with the result being announced in
January.
Sir Alec is Glasgow's 39th chancellor. The Principal -- and
vice-chancellor -- is the university's chief executive but Sir Alec, who
is 83, has been much more than a figurehead, offering advice and
guidance over the years.
Mr Michael Moss, the university's archivist, said: ''Sir Alec has
become a kenspeckle figure about Gilmorehill with his ubiquitous cloth
cap and unassuming manner, a friend and counsellor to all he
encountered.
''Full of new ideas and information when most of his age have taken to
gardening, he will be much missed.
''This is the first time since 1692 that a chancellor has resigned,
all the others died in office,'' Mr Moss added.

SUPPORT for John Major's government is being drowned out by a
crescendo of protest if last night's John Smith Memorial Debate,
sponsored by The Herald, is anything to go by.
After 100 minutes of oratorical ding-dong, the ayes clearly had it.
The House, it rousingly proclaimed, had no confidence in Her Majesty's
Government.
Featuring in the Glasgow University Union debate in honour of the late
Labour leader were SNP leader Alex Salmond, Labour front bencher Donald
Dewar, Liberal Democrats Menzies Campbell and Charles Kennedy, and
Junior Health Minister Gerry Malone.
Setting the tone for the evening, Mr Campbell said: ''If John Smith
were here he would say there is work to be done, there are dragons to be
slain, there are Tories to be exposed.''
He described Mr Smith, one of the university's most prominent
debaters, as ''not only the leader of his party but the leader of his
political generation''.
Mr Campbell was joined by SNP leader Alex Salmond, who received the
most hearty jeer of the night when it was revealed he had attended St
Andrews University. Describing the Tories as a divided party, he said:
''I want this House not to vote for no confidence in the Government but
in the governments of this country.''
Mr Charles Kennedy described the Lib Dems as ''the only party to have
elected a trained killer to lead us''. After pausing, he added,
''although Margaret Thatcher was self-taught''.
Summing up, Donald Dewar accused the Government of widening social
gaps. He said: ''People's life chances are diminished, educational
opportunities are denied, and life expectancies are shortened.''
In a robust defence Gerry Malone rounded on each of the Opposition
parties. Dismissing the SNP and Liberal Democrats as electorally
irrelevant, he said of the Labour Party: ''It used to believe in
unilateral disarmament, it used to be against devolution and against
trade union reform. How can the country trust a party which has not only
modified but abolished all the principles it once held dear?''
Taking the dispatch box during the open period, Mr Smith's daughter
Sarah offered a polished attack on Home Secretary Michael Howard. She
said: ''He wishes to spend millions on new prisons which senior judges
accept will have no impact on the rate of crime. It is only to satisfy
the baying for blood in his own party.''

<TEXT>
A GAY stockbroker, who stole more than #3m-worth of shares from the
British Heart Foundation after robbing his father of his life savings,
was jailed for six years yesterday.
Jeremy Gray, 27, claimed he was forced to commit the crimes because of
death threats from drug runners, the IRA, and even the Mafia.
East London's Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that the ''bizarre'' story
was merely his smokescreen to try to escape justice.
The truth, said Mr Nigel Seed, prosecuting, was that the high-flying
professional was part of a Dutch homosexual ring who simply stole
#55,000-worth of stock belonging to Gray's father before targeting the
charity.
Gray was found guilty of three counts of theft, two of false
accounting, two of producing a false accounting document, and one of
handling stolen goods.
The two-week trial heard that the stockbroker from Clapham Common
Northside, south London, had relieved his father of his investments and
transferred the proceeds to Luxembourg. He then turned his attention to
the BHF, which had holdings worth more than #100m with his employer,
Panmure Gordon.
Gray sold #3.1m of the shares which had been held in companies
including Boeing.

IT might have been Mr Major's big day at the Tory Party conference,
but Labour leader Tony Blair got the royal handshake.
As Mr Major was urging Conservatives into battle, Mr Blair was meeting
the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh as they toured a lighting factory in
his Sedgefield constituency.
''The Tories will think I've set this up,'' he said, waiting for the
royal visitors to arrive.
The Queen extended her gloved hand for Mr Blair's firm handshake but
there was no conversation, just a polite exchange of greetings.
However, the Duke of Edinburgh stopped to talk to Mr Blair, making
what appeared to be a joke.
It was not Mr Blair's first meeting with the Queen. He had an audience
at Buckingham Palace shortly after becoming the leader of the Opposition
and, with his barrister wife Cherie, has been a dinner guest at Windsor
Castle.
The Queen, whose right eye was severely bloodshot, was visiting the
British-owned Thorn Lighting factory at Spennymoor, County Durham,
during a day in the North-east of England.
Earlier, she set production rolling at the #450m Korean Samsung
electronics plant which will create 3000 jobs at Billingham, Cleveland,
making microwave ovens, computer monitors, fax machines, and TV cathode
ray tubes.

Pre-Christmas threat of industrial action.
THE possibility of postal workers in Scotland and Northern Ireland
going on strike around Christmas arose yesterday as their trade union
representatives called on Royal Mail to withdraw a proposal it was
claimed would mean the loss of 500 full-time jobs.
A meeting of officers of the Union of Communication Workers decided in
Edinburgh to call for a ballot on industrial action by the 13,500
members if talks with Royal Mail proved unsatisfactory.
The UCW was responding to a confidential memorandum by management
which, the union claimed, proposed job cuts and meant compulsory
redundancies.
Royal Mail, however, later accused Scottish leaders of the UCW of
misleading its members and customers over the alleged job losses and
threatening services at Christmas.
Representatives of the employers and the union are to meet in
Edinburgh on Monday.
Mr John Keggie, the union's divisional officer, said yesterday the
most serious threat in the memorandum was that 500 full-time jobs would
go by the end of the year.
The management was offering fixed-term contracts to 500 part-time
workers. The meeting had decided to oppose completely any attempt to
remove any jobs without agreement and was also against conditions which
Royal Mail had imposed recently.
Postal workers were being forced to carry more than 35lb in one
delivery, to use their own cars for deliveries, and to work without
proper meal breaks.
Mr Keggie said Royal Mail was trying to get through-put dealt with in
one delivery and to remove the second delivery.
He hoped industrial action would not take place but foresaw it taking
place in four to six weeks if negotiations with Royal Mail failed.
''There could be a major effect on mail deliveries over the Christmas
period but we remain optimistic industrial action won't be necessary. It
needs common sense on the part of the employers.''
A Royal Mail spokesman said later: ''We are amazed by the union's
misunderstanding of this issue. They are perfectly aware there is no
question of job reductions on the scale they are describing.
''There is nothing new here. We are in fact creating 700 permanent
long-term jobs from the temporary posts.
''However, as part of our planned gradual reduction in staffing levels
over a five-year period, which was announced three years ago, we expect
to lose 500 full-time jobs by the end of the year.
''Our plans also include the creation of 500 new part-time posts. The
CWU have been consulted over these plans from the beginning and to
pretend otherwise is mischievous.''
The spokesman said it was irresponsible to do something which would
cause unnecessary concern to employees and equally inappropriate to
suggest balloting. This fell outside the process, agreed with the union,
for handling issues.
''We are confident any reductions will be achieved through natural
wastage or voluntary means.''

PLANS to house the new National Gallery of Scottish Art in the Post
Office building in George Square, Glasgow, remained in doubt last night
although gallery supporters say they understand no decision on the sale
of the building has yet been taken.
Mr Kenneth Graham, Scottish Post Office board chairman, said after the
latest meeting between Post Office officials and gallery supporters
yesterday that a decision on the successful bidder would be announced no
later than next Friday after ''careful consideration'' of all bids.
Glasgow Development Agency has offered #3m for the building in
conjunction with the National Galleries of Scotland and Glasgow District
Council.
There are believed to be two other bids, one of about #4.5m from an
unnamed property developer who is understood to be planning a
multi-million pound shopping mall.
Mr Graham said the Post Office was in exploratory talks with those
bidding for the building and stressed that, as a publicly owned
organisation with commercial obligations, the Post Office owed it to its
customers, taxpayers, and the Government to accept the best bid.
He was speaking after he and Post Office chief executive Bill Cockburn
met in London with GDA chairman Michael Lunn, GDA chief executive Stuart
Gulliver, and Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of
Scotland.

TWO children of Mrs Rosemary West are preparing a book about their
parents and yesterday offered world rights.
British publisher Peter Grose said at the Frankfurt Book Fair that the
book by 23-year-old Mae West and her brother Stephen, 21, would be
published as soon as possible after their mother's trial ends.
Mrs West has denied murdering 10 girls and young women, including a
daughter and stepdaughter, over a 16-year period.
''We are offering rights around the world,'' Mr Grose said.
''The Dutch, Italians and Germans have been negotiating. I am signing
up deals in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The Americans are
interested.''
The first two parts of the book, based on interviews conducted with
the children by two journalists, have already been written. The third
will be based on the trial.
In another book deal, trader Nick Leeson sold his story of the #860m
collapse of Barings Bank for a reported #450,000.
Ms Philippa Harrison, managing director of Little Brown UK, which
bought the memoirs, said they were ''full of revelations'' and likely to
embarrass a number of people.
The editor of Publishing News, Mr Fred Newman, estimated that
worldwide book rights alone might make #1m.
Ms Harrison said Leeson named names in the book and a number of people
were likely to find it ''pretty embarrassing''.
The book, being written in collaboration with Mr Edward Whitley, a
journalist and former merchant banker, is about half finished.
Mr Leeson's lawyer, Mr Stephen Pollard, said: ''The first thing he
will do with the money is use it for his legal representation.''
Mr Pollard said the trader also needed money so his wife Lisa could
afford to fly to Singapore to visit him if he ended up in jail there.
A German court has approved Leeson's extradition to Singapore on eight
charges of fraud and three of forgery, although his lawyers are due to
appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court.
However it was not clear whether he would profit from his story.
Barings' administrators, Ernst &amp; Young, are serving a writ on Mr
Leeson as a ''protective measure'' although a spokesman was unable to
say whether they would pursue him for any book earnings.

A FURTHER low-cost air service between Scotland and London is to be
introduced next week.
Just three weeks after Ryanair announced it was to link Prestwick and
Stansted airports for #59 return, a new service is to be launched from
Glasgow and Edinburgh to Luton.
As disclosed in The Herald earlier this year, Greek shipping
millionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou will launch EasyJet.
While the exact fare structure remains a closely guarded secret,
industry sources indicate he may initially charge less than Ryanair's
lowest charge.
The launch of the EasyJet Airline Company's new routes is planned for
the Planet Hollywood restaurant in London on Wednesday, with Mr
Haji-Ioannou travelling to Glasgow the next day for media and trade
briefings.
The new company will use jet aircraft to fly three times a day from
both Glasgow and Edinburgh to Luton.
The airline is to base its operations on the burgeoning ''peanut''
airlines in the United States, such as Southwest and ValuJet, who have
undercut rivals by offering a no-frills service with basic catering such
as soft drinks and peanuts.
Another innovation to UK air travel which the new company is expected
to introduce is ''free seating'' which does away with the need for
boarding cards and allows passengers to choose their own seat as they
board the aircraft.
Plans are well under way to accommodate EasyJet at Glasgow and
Edinburgh with a gate on the now under-used former international pier at
Glasgow set aside and work starting on a dedicated lounge and check-in
area for the company.

THE Crown has lodged an appeal against what it regards as an
over-lenient sentence of probation and a #7500 compensation order in a
case where the accused bit off a policeman's ear.
The sentence on Thomas Bennett was imposed by Lord Clyde on the same
day that the Crown used video evidence to persuade the Court of Criminal
Appeal that the judge had been too lenient in another case.
The appeal court increased from four years to seven jail terms Lord
Clyde passed on two men who carried out a savage attack outside a
Glasgow nightclub.
They smashed their victim's face against a window, pulled him to the
ground then repeatedly jumped and stamped on his head.
At the High Court in Edinburgh last month, Lord Clyde placed Bennett,
25, on probation for two years, ordered him to carry out 200 hours of
community service, and told him to pay his victim, policeman Iain Bell,
#7500 compensation.
At the time of the incident, Mr Bell was a sergeant with Tayside
Police. He has now been promoted to the rank of inspector.
Bennett, of Western Road, Carronshore, Falkirk, admitted assaulting Mr
Bell in Marshall Place, Perth, on January 2 last year, to his severe
injury and permanent disfigurement.
He repeatedly bit the police officer on the ear and when Mr Bell was
taken to Perth Royal Infirmary it was discovered that a large part of
his left ear had been severed.
The missing piece was found and Mr Bell needed a total of 10
operations to have the ear reconstructed.
Bennett also admitted assaulting another police officer, Constable
David Rankin, by biting him on the hand, and attacking a taxi driver.
Solicitor-advocate Joe Beltrami, who appeared for Bennett, told the
court that his client had spent 17 weeks in custody, the equivalent of
an eight-month sentence.
He had also sold his car and other items to raise #7500, which he
offered as compensation to his victim.
Lord Clyde said the offence would normally have merited a very
significant period of imprisonment but the circumstances were
extraordinary and Bennett, who claimed his drink had been spiked before
the incidents, appeared to have acted out of character.
After the sentence, Sergeant Stewart Falconer, a Scottish Police
Federation official in Tayside, commented: ''It is derisory. It will do
nothing to alleviate the fears any of our members have about being
assaulted on the streets.''
Mr Beltrami said yesterday: ''I thought it was a very sensible
sentence and that the judge exercised his discretion extremely wisely.''
He added that the compensation had already been lodged with the
sheriff clerk at Perth and that Bennett had begun his two years'
probation and community service.

BETWEEN 1939 and 1944, first in Liverpool and then in Los Alamos,
Professor Joseph Rotblat was involved in the making of the atom bomb
which was eventually dropped on Hiroshima.
Then the Polish-born physicist became the only scientist on the
Manhattan Project to resign, once it became clear that Germany was not
developing a nuclear bomb.
When he asked to return to Britain, the future Nobel Peace prize
winner was accused of spying and allowed to leave New Mexico only after
agreeing not to talk to anybody about the reason for his departure.
Professor Rotblat believes the scientist has a duty to speak out on
important issues. Fifty years after the destruction of Hiroshima, he
declared: ''The use of atom bombs was unjustified, their making
unnecessary. They have placed the whole of our civilisation in perpetual
peril. The world will never be the same again.''
Professor Rotblat, 86, is the last surviving signatory of the
manifesto against the H-bomb drafted by Bertrand Russell and Albert
Einstein at the height of the Cold War.
Together, they sparked off the international scientific movement known
as the Pugwash conference, of which Professor Rotblat is still
president. It is named after the venue of their first meeting, Pugwash
in Nova Scotia.
Since 1955, Pugwash scientists have made the avoidance of nuclear war
and war in general their main objective. Professor Rotblat, more than
any other man, has been the driving force of the Pugwash movement and
its success is a tribute to his determination.
Often acting as a diplomatic conduit, Pugwash conferences played a
crucial role in the disarmament process. It has also been suggested the
Cuban missile crisis was resolved by Pugwash scientists who conveyed to
Moscow the deal by which the US would remove missiles from Turkey in
exchange for the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.
Professor Rotblat was born in Warsaw in 1908 and it was at university
there that the young electrical engineer became fired with an interest
in nuclear physics.
After arriving in Britain in April 1939, he became a lecturer at
Liverpool University and offered his services for war work but was at
first rejected. Then he took part in the experiment that proved a
nuclear bomb was theoretically possible.
In time, the Liverpool team moved to Los Alamos where Professor
Rotblat and others anxiously discussed the morals of the project. The
fellow of the Royal Society and emeritus professor of physics at St
Bartholomew's Hospital medical school said: ''The turning point came in
March 1944 -- 17 months before Hiroshima -- when General Leslie Groves,
head of the Manhattan Project, said that we probably realised the real
purpose of making the bomb was to worry and subdue the Russians, whom
the Americans believed would be the new enemy after the war. I realised
no such thing and was deeply shocked.''

THE 1995 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded yesterday to anti-nuclear
campaigner Joseph Rotblat and his Pugwash organisation.
The choice was a strong political message aimed at French nuclear
tests in the South Pacific.
The committee cited Professor Rotblat, 86, a Polish-born scientist who
lives in London, and the Pugwash conferences ''for their work to
diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics, and,
in the longer run, to eliminate such arms''.
They had worked behind the scenes to get scientists to ''take
responsibility for their inventions'', the citation said.
Committee chairman Francis Sejersted, in hailing Professor Rotblat's
work, condemned countries such as France and China for continuing to
test nuclear weapons.
''One of the reasons for the prize is a sort of protest against
testing of nuclear weapons and nuclear arms in general,'' he said.
''This is also a message to all of the world's nuclear powers.''
France uneasily congratulated Professor Rotblat on winning the prize,
dodging his condemnation of the country's nuclear tests in the South
Pacific.
''We congratulate the Nobel Peace Prize laureate,'' foreign ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said.
''France wants disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, in
security.''
Professor Rotblat said last night that he hoped the prize ''is a
message not only to the French but to the Chinese as well''.

Judge attacks prison policy
SCOTLAND could double or even treble its prison population without
making any significant difference to the crime rate or the re-offending
rate, a leading judge claimed last night.
Lord McCluskey said there was no evidence to suggest that locking more
people away for longer periods had any measurable effect in reducing
crime.
The judge's views will be seen as a direct challenge to the ''tough on
crime'' line adopted at the Tory Party conference, although his speech,
delivered in Edinburgh, was prepared before the Blackpool gathering.
He made it clear that it was not a response to anything said by Home
Secretary Michael Howard or Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
In the annual McClintock Lecture, sponsored by the criminal justice
charity Sacro, the judge, a former Labour Solicitor-General, warned
against the ''disturbing penchant'' for trying to solve Britain's law
and order problems with American-style solutions such as boot camps,
electronic tagging, and private jails.
He pointed out that the US had a wholly different kind of society and
a ''dramatically different and worse'' criminal justice record.
''Above all, the US record on 'law and order' is frightening. Despite
being one of the richest countries in the world, it has one of the
highest crime rates and possibly the highest imprisonment rate in the
world, with more than a million of its citizens locked up, many of them
for very long periods, or for life.
''In California, the numbers incarcerated in state prisons has risen
sixfold in the last 20 years. So now, California -- population 33
million, one of the richest states in the country -- has more prisoners
in jails than in all the jails of France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland,
and the UK combined (combined populations 200 million).
''Obviously prison 'works' in the US, or indeed anywhere else, in the
sense that if you catch, convict, and imprison habitual criminals, you
prevent them from committing crimes outside prison while they remain
locked up.
''But it has not been shown that increasing rates and periods of
imprisonment have any measurable effect in reducing crime rates. Being
tough on crime does not seem to reduce the incidence of crime.
''My reading of the American experience is that increasing expenditure
in bringing suspects to face criminal courts, removing judicial
discretion in sentencing, increasing penalties very substantially,
reintroducing many well-publicised judicial executions by hanging,
poisoning, or electrocution, have had no clearly demonstrable effect in
reducing crime rates.
''Murders, shootings, drug dealing and abuse, robbery, muggings, and
the like continue as before or worse.''
Lord McCluskey accepted that the public in Britain was afraid of being
victimised by violent crime and wanted to see a reduction in the risk of
being assaulted or robbed.
''But my belief is that the criminal courts deal with such a small
proportion of offenders that even if we were to move towards Californian
rates of imprisonment -- and double or treble the prison population --
we would not make any significant difference to the crime rate or
re-offending rate.
''In other words, it is a mistake to look to the criminal justice
system to reduce the crime rate.''
He said we must stop ''fiddling'' with the criminal justice system
under the ''pretence'' that reforms affecting the right of silence, the
not- proven verdict, and rights of appeal would affect crime or
detection rates.
''If we are going to alter our procedures, let us try to do so in a
way that will avoid the waste of precious resources.
''Our current procedures and rules of evidence waste the time and sap
the spirit of hundreds, even thousands, of policemen, who are brought to
court to give evidence on minor matters that are commonly not even in
dispute. Many of them sent away without even being put in the witness
box.
''Policemen should be out in the streets, not sitting futilely in
court waiting rooms. A reform that successfully tackled this problem
would be very likely to reduce the crime rate and to improve the
clear-up rate.''
He called for a Royal Commission to take a fresh look at the causes of
crime and at the situation of people ''simply warehoused in jails''.
The Scottish Police Federation later said it agreed entirely that
police officers should be out on the streets instead of wasting time
waiting in court rooms often without being called to give evidence.

Election pledge.
Pledges on home rule and crime
A NEW drive against crime and grim resistance to a Scottish Parliament
are to be Mr Major's principal weapons for a ''watershed'' General
Election.
He steadied his party yesterday: ''We are going to mount the fight of
our lives.''
He wants a fifth term in office and to abolish socialism. The Tories
loved their new, relaxed Prime Minister whose rallying speech had a
fresh assurance.
The spies of the security services will be used in a new national
police squad to defeat organised crime, he announced.
There will be 5000 more police officers and 10,000 closed-circuit
cameras over the next three years.
The targets are the drug barons, money-launderers, and international
crime that is a threat to the State.
''The police will lead on this,'' he said. ''They will have the
support of the new National Criminal Intelligence Service, working with
Customs, MI6, and GCHQ (the Government's electronic counter-espionage
headquarters).''
To involve the security services in the fight against organised crime,
the law will be changed, he said.
He said it was absurd for it to be illegal for the security services
to help the police ''in an age when our children are more likely to be
killed by drug dealing than by an enemy missile''.
He added: ''So this autumn we will change the law. It's time to let
the security service into the battle for the public and against
organised crime.''
Mr Major revived his defence of the Union with a total rejection of
European federalism and an impassioned attack on Labour's plans for a
tax-raising Scottish Parliament.
If Scotland and Wales wanted independence, it could not properly
prevent it but devolution would be a stepping stone to independence and
he firmly restated his opposition: ''I will not trade easy votes today
for constitutional chaos tomorrow.''
It is his duty as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to warn of the
effect of Labour's plans for the constitution. ''The constitution is the
core, heart, guts of life in Britain.''
He is concerned that a Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers
would divide the UK and damage the Scottish economy and hit Scottish
taxpayers.
''The tartan tax will do two things: it will pay for more bureaucrats
and more politicians and it will begin the decline of Scottish
prosperity. That is only the start.
''Conflict with the Westminster Parliament would be inevitable. And
then the siren voices of the separatists will foment mischief and demand
an independent Scotland cut adrift from the UK.''
0 He reassured the Tory Euro-sceptics who have been quiet in their
activities at the Blackpool conference which ended yesterday.
He ruled out federalism, stating Britain did not enter it ''for
socialism through the back door. And we did not enter it for a federal
future in Europe.''
On taxation, he spoke of reducing inheritance and capital gains taxes.
From autumn next year, the unemployed will be required to undertake a
contract for work as part of a renewed campaign against idleness and
benefit fraud.
The Prime Minister clearly believes that, with his reducing Commons
majority, he may not be able to avoid a General Election until 1997.
So yesterday, in his best conference speech yet, he was gearing up his
party for what he called the fight of their lives.
''The next election is a watershed, because whoever wins will inherit
the strongest economy for decades. We built that economy. It was
painful, it was difficult.
''I don't know about you but I'm not in the mood to hand it over to
Labour to wreck.''
He dealt with what he called his ''housekeeping'' -- his party
leadership election which he called last June to clear the air and end
the speculation that he might be replaced.
''It had to end whatever the risk. I might have lost but I won.''
He reclaimed for Tories the ''one nation'' title which Labour leader
Tony Blair has been trying to wrest from them with growing success.
His attack on Mr Blair included a neat piece of class reversal. He
pointed out that the late Tory figurehead Iain Macleod invented the one
nation theme and he, like Mr Blair, went to Fettes public school while
he, John Major, did not have that benefit.
He spoke poignantly of his small businessman father who struggled
unsuccessfully to maintain his firm making garden gnomes. Some people,
he said, found this amusing, but he did not.
The Tories, severely alarmed by Mr Blair's revamped Labour Party, were
sent away from their conference with orders to keep the constitution
safe and to argue that taxes and inflation would be higher under Labour.
There would be less choice and the defence of Britain would be less
secure.
It was a big speech at a crucial time. Now the Tories are in a better
mood to go down fighting: but yesterday their leader gave them the hope
that they have a chance of winning next time.

THE threatened ferry service between Ardrossan and the Isle of Man may
be retained on a limited basis, Caledonian MacBrayne has announced.
The company's managing director, Mr Colin Paterson, is having
discussions with officials of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company with
a view to operating the service for four weekends next summer around the
time of the TT motorcycle races.
The threat to axe the service angered Cunninghame North MP Brian
Wilson who accused both companies of failing to market the service
properly.
He still holds this view but has welcomed the decision to explore a
limited service. Mr Wilson added: ''I did not believe that the service
was properly marketed within Scotland and I still think that the
withdrawal of the service is premature.''
Mr Paterson has defended the marketing which was carried out on ''very
small funds'' and told the MP that passenger figures were very
disappointing.

POLICE investigating the murder of three generations of a family said
yesterday they wanted to speak to a Moroccan whose wife and 16-month-old
daughter were among the dead.
They urged 37-year-old Brahim Aderdour to come forward after his wife,
Sophia, and daughter, Amina, were found dead along with Sophia's
parents, John and Vivien Trant, at their home in Islington, London, on
Thursday. All four had been stabbed.
Their bodies were found by police at the house in Dagmar Street,
Islington, after a 999 call had been cut off before the caller had
spoken.
Police refused to say Mr Aderdour was a suspect in the murder inquiry
but said ports and airports had been alerted.
They confirmed there had been a history of domestic violence during
his six-year marriage to Sophia.
She is believed to have consulted domestic violence counsellors hours
before she died.
A knife was discovered near the murder scene after a policeman smashed
his way in through a downstairs window to find Amina lying between her
grandmother and mother.
Detective Superintendent Derick Dale, leading the murder inquiry,
confirmed that Amina, Sophia, 32, Mr Trant, 71, and his 57-year-old wife
Vivien had all been stabbed.
He declined to confirm that as the cause of death until post- mortem
examinations were completed.
Mr Dale told a news conference at Islington police station that Mr
Aderdour should come forward and help police.
''I am very anxious to speak to him as he might be able to help us,''
he said.
Mr Aderdour, an unemployed designer, came to Britain in 1989 and
married Sophia the same year.
Mr Dale confirmed that domestic violence had been reported in the
marriage and the couple were ''attempting to go through divorce
proceedings''.

NOBEL Peace prize winner Professor Joseph Rotblat lapped up the media
limelight yesterday as he celebrated his unexpected reward for half a
lifetime devoted to the cause of nuclear disarmament.
The 86-year-old London-based physicist was as surprised as anyone that
the Nobel Committee had honoured a man ''no-one has heard of'' and an
organisation whose name reminded most people of a cartoon pirate
captain.
Polish-born Professor Rotblat founded the Pugwash Conferences on
Science and World Affairs 40 years ago, with 11 fellow scientists
determined to reduce the danger of armed conflict. Their inaugural
meeting was in the Canadian fishing village of Pugwash, Nova Scotia.
The conferences brought together scientists, scholars, and public
figures from East and West to discuss nuclear and other security issues,
giving the intellectual elites from both sides a rare chance for
invitation-only ''brainstorming''.
Professor Rotblat, happily posing for photographers in the
organisation's ramshackle offices in central London, over the road from
the British Museum, said: ''It came completely unexpectedly.
''I read today that the people who are going to get it were the Prime
Minister and the former Prime Minister of Ireland. ''All these big names
and I thought 'Where do I come in? No-one has ever heard of me'.''
Professor Rotblat, who felt ''overwhelmed'' to receive the award, only
learned from journalists that the prize carried with it a purse of $1m
(#637,000). He joked: ''I have not seen the colour of their money yet.''
On a more serious note he added: ''We have worked in very difficult
financial conditions and it would be nice to get some decent
accommodation and to be able to invite people to our meetings and pay
their travel expenses.''
Professor Rotblat's passion for nuclear disarmament stemmed from his
close involvement in developing the atomic bomb that devastated
Hiroshima 50 years ago.
''This is recognition of my life's work and the work of many other
scientists who have worked over these years in isolation,'' he said of
the award. However, he warned: ''The danger is still there for future
generations. We have to aim at something that is completely utopian. We
have to aim to stop all wars, not just nuclear war.''
Asked what message he would like to send to French President Jacques
Chirac, he said: ''The Nobel committee in Norway have decided that
getting rid of nuclear weapons is the right thing to do.
''Testing nuclear weapons is wrong and I ask him to think again about
these tests.''
Professor Rotblat was nominated for the prize by Ms Janet Bloomfield,
the current chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, in her role
as vice-president of the Geneva-based International Peace Bureau.
Ms Bloomfield said: ''This is proper recognition of one of the world's
most important anti-nuclear weapons campaigners. His award is richly
deserved. I am personally delighted that his enormous contribution to
the anti-nuclear weapons movement has been rewarded.''
Greenpeace congratulated Professor Rotblat and welcomed comments from
the awarding committee that it was a specific protest against French
nuclear tests.
In welcoming the award, Mr Georgy Arbatov, a Soviet veteran of the
Pugwash conferences, said the movement had helped end the Cold War.
Mr Arbatov, who served as a foreign policy adviser to several Soviet
leaders, including Mikhail Gorbachev and Leonid Brezhnev, said the
movement was once closely monitored by the US and Soviet intelligence
services. However, he said, it was nevertheless an important
communication conduit between East and West.
''Rotblat has put new life into the movement in the last few years,''
said Mr Arbatov, who joined the Pugwash conferences in 1967 with other
Soviet scientists.
''Some people thought that it (the movement) was not needed in the
post-Cold War world but Rotblat noticed that not everything was that
good.''

<HEADLINE>Mod opens with call for radical reform</HEADLINE>

THE 92nd Royal National Mod opened last night in the Highland town of
Golspie, but not without controversy.
A former senior official of organisers An Comunn Gaidhealach said the
Gaelic body needed to be radically reformed along with the festival
itself.
Mr Duncan Ferguson, who gave up his position on the body's management
committee last June, called for the event to be split in two, with
children's competitions held in the summer, and for ceilidh contests to
be included in a five-day adult festival.
He described An Comunn's network of local branches as backward-looking
and ''almost moribund''.
Mr Donald John MacSween, An Comunn's chief executive, dismissed Mr
Ferguson's comments as ''out of date''.
Meanwhile a former national director of An Comunn is behind a series
of unofficial shows at this year's festival.
In what will be seen as a cheeky move bound to rile Mod organisers, Mr
Donnie MacLean, who was sacked by the organisation last year, confirmed
he was a partner in Faire Productions, which is putting on Gaelic shows
in Golspie, Dornoch, Dingwall, and Inverness next week.
But the 59-year-old former Mod chief insisted yesterday: ''I'm not
trying to put on an alternative Mod fringe.''

Bottles and chairs thrown at Glasgow ringside.
BOXING fans rioted in Glasgow last night after a British title fight
ended with one of the Scots boxers unconscious and fighting for his
life.
The fight at the Hospitality Inn between British bantamweight champion
Drew Docherty, from Condorrat, Dunbartonshire, who was defending the
title against Jim Murray, of Newmains, Lanarkshire, was stopped
dramatically in the 12th round when Murray slumped unconscious to the
canvas.
Murray was being given medical assistance in the ring when the master
of ceremonies had to appeal for calm among the rival supporters.
However, many of the fans, who were drunk, ignored his plea and hurled
bottles, chairs, and glasses at rivals as the young boxer lay in the
ring.
Murray, 25, was taken unconscious by ambulance to the Southern General
Hospital. He was put on a ventilator in the casualty department before
being transferred to the hospital's neurosurgery department where he
underwent an emergency operation. Early this morning a hospital
spokesman described his condition as ''very serious''.
While medical staff battled to save his life, Strathclyde Police were
dealing with scenes of mayhem at the hotel where screaming women and
children fled from the onslaught of missiles. One woman was seen lying
on the ground with a bloody gash on the back of her head.
Five people were treated at the Royal Infirmary for minor injuries as
drunken friends milled around the casualty department.
The fight was being broadcast live on satellite television and the
scenes of hooliganism will have done much to harm the city's reputation.
Extra police were sent to the hotel as stunned fans rushed out into
the street for safety. Others staggered around in a drunken haze.
One fan said: ''You could smell that there was going to be trouble.
The first bottles were thrown by Murray's fans I think, but others will
no doubt tell you otherwise. Some of them had clearly been drinking long
before they arrived at the match.''
Herald boxing writer Jim Reynolds said it was the worst scenes he had
seen in Scotland.
Mr John Morris, the general secretary of the British Boxing Board of
Control, who was at the fight, also said what he had witnessed were some
of the most disreputable scenes he had seen.
''They were partisan supporters but for this to happen is an absolute
disgrace. Hooliganism has got into boxing and it has got to get out,''
he said. ''I will want a full report and we will have a hearing on the
full matter.''
Mr Morris said Docherty, 29, who knew that the main ''prize'' for
victory last night would be a European title contest early next year,
was in a state of shock after the fight. He said: ''His glory has been
taken away by the utter stupidity of a number of louts.''
As he waited for a police escort to take his boxer out of the hotel,
Docherty's manager, Mr Tommy Gilmour, told The Herald that it had been a
sad night and added: ''But it is a sad night for the boy who is ill. We
can all recover from people throwing chairs.''
He said his young boxer was ''gutted'' by Murray being taken from the
ring unconscious. ''He is going home with a hollow championship because
the boy is lying ill.''
He insisted that the trouble outside the ring had not been caused by
fans of either of the two boxers and said that a hooligan element must
have come to the fight.
He pointed out that fans of the two boxers had bought tickets for
sections of the banqueting hall where there had been no trouble. The
trouble, he said, had taken place where the remaining tickets had been
sold off.
There has been considerable rivalry between the two sets of fans. Many
had paid up to #80 for a ringside meal at the contest. The trouble
though appears to have started among supporters who had paid #30 simply
to watch the boxing.
During the bout the rival fans taunted each other. But Murray's defeat
was the spark for mayhem, and bottles and chairs flew.
Some people had believed that the intense rivalry was based on
religion because Docherty boxed for a club in the mainly Roman Catholic
village of Croy. However, both boxers are Protestants.
A senior police official was unable to confirm whether there had been
any arrests.
