LOCAL Government reorganisation and the Government's decision to
create new public authorities to take charge of council-run water and
sewerage services was cited yesterday by the Scottish Office as being
among the reasons for senior management deciding it was an appropriate
time to see how staff could best be deployed for the future.
The 29 new single-tier councils and the three water authorities are
due to assume full powers next April.
Housing, planning and local government currently come under the
Environment Department. Under the proposed internal re-structuring they
would form part of a new major grouping with transport, including roads.
Water services, also with environment but now being detached from
local government, would move under the new agriculture and fisheries
department.
Transport and roads currently come under the industry department where
a roads directorate looks after trunk roads and motorways which are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State.
Another section within the industry department deals with a broad
range of transport matters such as railways, bus policy, civil aviation,
some airports, shipping subsidies and EC transport issues as well as the
funding of capital works for local roads which are the responsibility of
councils.
On the roads front, the Scottish Office has yet to announce the
outcome of recent consultations on its proposals about the future
management and maintenance of trunk roads and motorways with a view to
increasing private sector involvement.
The new department would also have responsibility for urban
regeneration, new towns -- whose special status is being phased out --
and European Union Structural Funds, currently with the industry
department. It would also deal with policy for historic buildings.

THE dance halls which meant so much to a generation have mostly gone,
and all many people have left are the memories. But one couple have
something more solid to remind them of their courting days -- a luxury
flat on the site of the Gourock dance hall in which they fell in love.
The couple, returning recently to visit the area, found the Cragburn
Pavilion -- an imposing, but latterly dilapidated, landmark with
commanding views over the scenic Firth of Clyde -- was to be demolished
to make way for flats. Although saddened by the news, they followed
developments closely and were first to rush round to reserve one of the
luxury apartments, even before the foundations were laid.
But their decision wasn't just for old times' sake: they were
genuinely impressed by the developers' vision of prestigious apartments
designed to make the most of the truly spectacular location.
And they weren't alone in their enthusiasm for the Dawn Homes project,
with 23 out of the 33 up-market apartments already sold -- and that's
before the showflat has even opened.
People might wonder why, with the development in such big demand and
only 10 flats remaining, Dawn Homes should bother going to the expense
of furnishing and opening a showhouse (the doors open this weekend). The
answer is simple.
''We're very proud of Cragburn Gate. It's the jewel in the crown as
far as Dawn Homes is concerned,'' said managing director Andrew Reid,
''and we want to give the people of Gourock and surrounding areas an
opportunity to see what we have done with the site.
''Most of the people who have bought apartments so far have either
lived in the Gourock area, if not now, at some time in the past, and
have a Gourock connection. I think nobody has built the quality or style
that we are building there for a long time and we have filled a niche in
that market.
In fact, all the most expensive apartments -- the #96,500
two-bedroomed ''Fyne'', which had separate dining rooms -- have been
sold.
This owes much to the quality of the development as a whole, but also
to the location, whose potential was quickly spotted by Dawn Homes which
has managed to find and then build on some of the most beautiful
locations in Scotland. The green hills of the firth of Clyde have
inspired many poets, writers, and artists and, says the sales brochure,
''living at Cragburn Gate you too will be inspired with the beauty of
these hills as you watch the sun reflect off the glistening waters of
the Clyde, the masts of moored yachts appearing through the early
morning mist.''
And how better to enjoy the view than from the apartments' generous
balcony, accessed by 3m-wide patio doors which make a huge picture
window.
All apartments at Cragburn Gate are two-bedroomed and range from
#79,500 for the ''Gareloch'', #82,500 for the ''Striven'' and ''Goil''
and #89,500 for the ''Riddon''.
The specification also includes en-suite master bedroom with fitted
wardrobes; full gas central heating; fully fitted continental-style
dining kitchen with quality units including dish washer, fridge freezer,
oven, hob, hood, and washer drier; fully landscaped gardens; lifts to
all floors; generous room sizes with complete double glazing; security
parking and video door entry; satellite television; and refuse chute.
Dawn Homes' attention to detail is reflected in every aspect of these
homes, and Cragburn Gate apartments also feature cornicing to lounge,
hallway, and both bedrooms; built-in vanity units to bathroom;
satellite/TV points to lounge and master bedroom; telephone points to
lounge, hall, and master bedroom; choice of finish of bedroom furniture;
choice of kitchen units, colour of bathroom suites, and co-ordinating
tiling; concealed lighting to kitchen wall units; smoke alarms; and
10-year NHBC Buildmark Warranty.
The foyers, stairs and hallways are wallpapered and carpeted
throughout and together with wall lighting and some carefully chosen
prints, Dawn Homes aims to create an atmosphere of welcome.

We met them before, last October in Student Herald. They had left
Carluke High in Lanarkshire in the summer and were about to embark on
university courses at institutions all over Scotland. Then they were
worried about the work, making friends, and life beyond school.
Take a look at them, seven short months later. They're fully fledged
students, immersed in their new and interesting work, the vibrant social
life, and hardly able to believe that they've nearly completed their
first year. So how has it been for them? Has uni been all they thought
it would be? Lindsey Gair caught up with the class of '94.
YVONNE Gray, 18, communication and mass media student at Glasgow
Caledonian University:
''I think that everyone applying for a course should find out for
themselves exactly what they're getting into. You shouldn't just depend
on the career service to get it right for you. You should phone
departments, speak to people who have done the course, and find out
about the options that make it up. I think this is really important
because I picked a course that was unsuitable for me to start with and I
was very lucky to be able to transfer on to this one. You might not be
so lucky. The course is a lot more theoretical than I had expected. We
all thought we would be the next Tarantino after a fortnight, but we've
got to do the ground work first. Making friends was much easier than I
had thought. It was a real strain to begin with because you had to have
polite conversations with everyone you met. That's weird when you're
used to having your friends being round all the time, and you could be
as rude as you like to them. But after a couple of weeks you get to know
people better and it's great. Now I've got friends from France, Ayr,
Mexico and Bishopbriggs.''
Victoria Hunter, 18, immunology and pharmacology at Strathclyde
University:
''The first day was a nightmare. I didn't know where I was going and I
was late for my first class. Other people were late as well and when we
walked in the lecturer was giving a spiel about latecomers and how he
hated having them in his class. It's not really what you need on your
first day and I really didn't want to go back, especially as we had to
sit right at the front because there were no other rows free. It was
fine, though, everyone forgot all about it by the next week and by then
I knew how to get around. I don't have a lot of work to do at home apart
from general studying but I'm in uni for longer hours than all my
friends. I have two free hour labs each week, and next year I will have
four a week. I need to spend a lot of time writing up reports on them,
because they count for 20% of my overall mark. Labs have been really
good for meeting people, too. Before long everyone goes for a coffee
afterwards and you become good friends.''
Hazel Getty, 18, Law and French at Glasgow University:;
''I'm really happy because it's turned out to be exactly what I
thought it would be. Law is definitely the course for me. It's weird,
the lectures are identical to what I'd imagined. I've found a lot of my
friends in the matriculation queue -- it's funny how quickly you bond
with people when you stand in the rain with them for three-and-a-half
hours. I heard a rumour that everyone who did law was really stuck-up,
but I can honestly say that I have not met a single person like that
here. Sometimes I really worry about being able to pass the exams. If I
can't understand something I start to panic and think, ''oh, no! I
shouldn't be here!'' I think everyone gets that from time to to time.
I've got two exemptions so far so I must be doing something right. The
library is really good but I know a lot of first years don't go into it
at first because they're too embarrassed to ask for help. The only
problem is knowing where to start looking. You shouldn't be shy to find
others who know the system and can show you how it works.''
Andrew McLatchie, 18, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at
Strathclyde University:
''There's a lot more written work on my course than I had expected. We
have to write up at least eight pages of notes from each lab we do which
I wasn't really anticipating. However, most of the course is really
practical which was what I had hoped for. We got a couple of labs
recently where we used lathes and drills and did welding which was
really good because I had wanted to try the machines. I'm still not
totally sure about what I want to do when I graduate but we get talks
from people about future careers. I was particularly interested in one
job with British Airways. You got to do engineering work for different
projects involving planes and jet engines. I also wouldn't mind some
sort of sponsorship with an electronics company. My mechanical exams
weren't too bad but the electrical ones were hard mainly because of the
number of them. I had about nine after 10 weeks which I thought was
quite a lot for the first semester. I like uni a lot, better than school
but I still miss seeing all my friends every day that I have been with
since primary school.''
Vivian Hogg, 18, Science Studies at Strathclyde University:
''I'm in a lot of big classes doing a mix of everything. I'm not
specialising in any particular area yet. I think it's wise to keep my
options open at this point, but it makes it a bit difficult to make
friends in my lectures because the classes are so large. Sometimes I
only have to come into uni for a one-hour class and it can take me up to
four hours to get from my house to Glasgow. That's the worst thing about
uni. I don't think I'm alone when I say I really hate the travelling.
I'm not sure about uni, I think that may be some of my friends are
enjoyng it more than me. I wouldn't say that I've ever considered
leaving though. I wouldn't get a good enough job with my Highers. I
would advise new students to be wary when a course says that you can do
it without having a Higher in it. From my experience the lecturer goes
too fast when you're trying to take down what he thinks are background
notes, and what you're finding is brand new work. I know I didn't
prepare properly for my Christmas exams and I've got one resit -- I hope
not to get any more.''
Emma Makintosh, 18, English and Philosophy at Edinburgh University:
''I've really enjoyed living away from home. Halls are a good way to
get to know people when you're first at uni. I've got a much better
relationship with my parents now as well, I don't argue with them any
more. You have to be a lot more organised in halls, though. I have a set
budget to stick to and if I overspend I can't have any more. Also
there's always someone going out at night and you need to be motivated
enough to say no and stay in if you really think you need to work.
That's harder to do than it sounds. The downside of halls is the
tendency of people to become cliquey. I suppose that's bound to happen
when you're all living on top of one another. If there's anything I
wished I'd known at the start it would be that freshers' week counts for
nothing. There's so much pressure on you to make friends -- all I wanted
to do in the end was stay in my room. I think you're generally more
skint if you stay away. I've not had any new clothes for months. I
haven't taken out a loan yet but I have been sorely tempted.
Barrie Kirkness, 18, Computer Science at Paisley University:
''Living away from home is really good but I have had to take out a
loan because my grant only covers my rent. My money situation is pretty
worrying. I get sent cash from my parents but they're in Wales and I
don't feel I should have to go running to them all the time. My books
are quite expensive and I have to buy all my own food. We have the usual
flat fights about who's to clean the nasty things off the cooker, but
nothing too serious. I suppose I do like it better than school, but
school was good in that it prompted you to work all the time. I didn't
realise quite how much work would be involved at uni, and I'm the sort
of person who really needs a bit of a push to get myself going. I think
uni teaches you a lot about yourself and how you cope. I don't think I
was really warned enough about the time you spend on your own,
especially on the workfront. I wasn't prepared for it and I had to give
myself a good shake to make me sort out my own study routine. It's far
too easy not to bother doing anything at all.''
Craig Hollywood, 18, Civil Engineering, Glasgow Caledonian University:
''The course is a lot harder than I thought it would be. It's like
physics and maths at school but then there's a whole load of other stuff
that I don't even know how to describe. I passed semester A which was
good because it gave me the confidence in semester B. One of my friends
from home does the same course as me, and that was good to start with,
it helped to know someone on my first day. Now there's a big squad of us
who go round together. I've got a weekend job which pays me monthly and
I'm saving up to go on holiday. I've got a loan, too, because I couldn't
afford to buy everything I needed on my grant. I'm hoping to work all
summer though and I want to pay it off by next year. I like studying on
my own but a lot of times a group of us work together in the main study
hall. It's really good for discussing problems and working together
because you don't have to be quiet. However, sometimes we probably talk
more than we work, Tutorials really help. If you don't understand
something you can see a tutor individually.''
Kerr Finlayson, 18, accountancy at Glasgow University:
''I'm quite happy to stay at home and travel into uni at the moment. I
go out quite a lot in Glasgow with folk from uni and travelling hasn't
caused me too many problems. I like my home comforts and I don't fancy
having to cook for myself. I'd rather do something like Erasmus than
move into a flat. I'd like to study in France for a term in my third
year. I really love the social life and the freedom of being a student
-- being able to do whatever you like. In fact I like the whole idea of
being a student. Uni in general is really good fun, although there is a
ton of work to do. I don't think that my first day was really as
terrible as everyone made it out to be. You just had to brass neck it
like everyone else. I don't think I want to be an accountant but I'd
really like to do something in business. Business law is the class I
enjoy most and I'm in the economics society. I wish I had been a bit
more clued up on the financial side of things like student loans. All
that stuff you can find out if you try.''
Paul Reynolds, 18, physics at St Andrews University:
''St Andrews is just as good as I thought it would be. It's so
studenty it's unbelievable. I think it's just us here and the
70-year-olds. There's a real community atmosphere. I'm in self-catering
halls so I've had to learn how to keep body and soul together pretty
fast. I almost eat anything I can shove in the oven. The exams are
pretty difficult and I think you have to realise that you're going to
meet a lot of intelligent people at uni and you have to accept that you
might not be the top of the class all the time any more. I still want to
teach, but since I've been here I've realised how much I'm going to have
to learn and if I teach in high school I might not get to use much of
this. When you get to uni you realise how little you really do know
about your subject. For now I'm just going to try to get through the
course without worrying too much about what comes after. I'm trying not
to get into debt, My theory is that you have money at the start of term
when you have no exams so you can spend it, and by the time the exams
come around you'll be skint so you have to stay in and study.''
I really love the social life and the freedom of being a student --
being able to do whatever you like. In fact I like the whole idea of
being a student. Uni in general is really good fun, although there is a
ton of work to do. I don't think that my first day was really as
terrible as everyone made it out to be.

The Open University
Part of the UK Open University, it delivers the full range of the
university's courses in Scotland to about 11,000 undergraduates and 8000
students taking other courses for professional updating or personal
interest. The undergraduate programme offers courses from the Faculties
of Arts, Social Sciences, Education, Mathematics, Science and
Technology. There are no entrance qualifications for undergraduate level
courses, and study is on a distance, part-time basis. Qualifications
such as a degree are obtained by accumulating a number of study credits
from a modular structure of courses.
A network of study and location centres throughout Scotland offers a
local contact point for students to meet their tutors, counsellors, and
fellow students. Immediate student support is offered by a network of
about 700 part-time academic staff throughout Scotland.
Course content is delivered to the students in their homes by written
units, television and video, and radio and audio-tape. Students also
attend residential schools, where they have access to specialist
tuition. The OU's admissions system is so distinctive that its courses
do not appear in our tables. For further information, contact: Ms Alison
Crookston, Regional Adviser, The Open University in Scotland, 10
Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh EH3 7QJ.
The University of Paisley
The university's students have access to the most up-to-date equipment
as used in the industrial and commercial sectors, giving them an
excellent start in their chosen careers. About 7000 students are
currently studying on undergraduate and postgraduate courses in one of
the four Faculties: Education; Engineering; Information, Social and
Management Sciences; Science and Technology.
The main campus is in the centre of Paisley. A second campus -- the
Faculty of Education -- has been created by the merger with Craigie
College in Ayr. The university has opened several new teaching buildings
and expanded its residential accommodation. Paisley is the largest town
in Scotland and lies only seven miles from Glasgow.
The university has a flexible admissions policy and welcomes a wide
range of alternatives to Scottish Highers. Mature applicants lacking
formal qualifications but with relevant work experience are also welcome
to apply.
Queen Margaret College
The college, a university-sector institution in Edinburgh with degree
awarding powers, provides vocational and professional courses in three
fields: health care; the theatre arts; and business management and
information with special relevance to the food, hospitality, retail, and
communication industries. As part of the institution's vocational
approach, students gain experience in their chosen profession at the
earliest opportunity. This can range from developing new plays with
recognised playwrights to international business placements.
The college is committed to ensuring that access to all courses is as
open as possible. Even without formal qualifications, it may be possible
for a mature student to gain the necessary entrance requirements.
The student population is diverse, with more than 3000 students --
about 400 of whom are part-time -- and about 3000 attending short
courses each year. The college benefits from twin campus locations --
the quiet 24 acres at Corstorphine and the attractive Leith campus on
the edge of Leith Links.
The Robert Gordon University
The Aberdeen-based university offers a wide range of vocational
courses at degree and diploma levels within the four academic faculties
of Design, Health &amp; Food, Management and Science &amp; Technology. A
practical approach to education is demonstrated throughout undergraduate
courses. The university offers accommodation for the most part in
self-catering flats, with priority for first-year students. It also
offers more than 40 degree courses, as well as HND programmes. Students
on diploma courses can transfer to a related degree without any loss of
time. Many courses are offered on a part-time basis. The libraries offer
multi-media learning materials including interactive video and computer
software.
The university operates a flexible admissions policy, reflecting its
commitment to wider access. Applications from mature students who are
without formal qualifications, or who currently attend access courses,
are positively encouraged.
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
Scotland's only Conservatoire is housed in superb, new, purpose-built
premises with state-of-the-art facilities in the centre of Glasgow. The
Academy is one of the four Royal Schools of Music and one of the two
Royal Academies of Dramatic Art in the UK. RSAMD students continue to
win many prestigious awards.
The School of Music courses provide the training and experience
necessary for entry into careers in all branches of musical performance
and teaching. The School offers three degrees -- BMus in Performance, BA
in Musical Studies and BEd in Music, the last taught with Strathclyde
University's Faculty of Education. Successful completion of the BEd
degree carries the award of a teaching qualification in Scottish
secondary schools.
The School of Drama is a centre of practical study. The BA course in
Dramatic Studies is aimed at students whose broad interests lie in
drama, but have yet to discover where their aptitudes and career
prospects might lie. It is not a course of actor-training. A BA in
Acting intended to be offered from 1996 is designed for those wishing to
act professionally. The School of Drama also offers an HND course in
Production and Technical Stage Management. Entrance requirements to all
courses comprise or include competitive auditions and/or interviews.
Details from the schools themselves.
St Andrew's College
As an associate college of the University of Glasgow, St Andrew's
offers undergraduate courses for those wishing to teach in secondary,
primary or nursery schools. Two honours degree courses in education are
offered: Bachelor of Education in Primary and Bachelor of Education in
Music. Both incorporate a teaching qualification, and a Catholic
Teachers' Religious Education Certificate.
The college also offers an honours course leading to the degree of
Bachelor of Theology for those wishing to teach in both denominational
and non-denominational schools. Catholic students wishing to teach in
Roman Catholic schools will be eligible for the award of the Catholic
Certificate in Religious Education.
A sophisticated learning resources department maintains a range of
facilities for staff and student use. It includes video production and
computing facilities. The college has five halls of residence.
Normal entrance requirements may be relaxed in the case of mature
students. All enquiries should be addressed to Student Services in the
College.
St Andrews to Strathclyde
The University of St Andrews
The University offers all the advantages of the compactness of a
campus university combined with the benefits of integration with the
local community. The town of St Andrews has a population of 15,000, so
almost 5000 undergraduates plus postgraduates and staff contribute a
major element to the social mix.
The antiquity of the city and the university, which was founded in
1410, means wonderful old buildings, city walls, a castle and cathedral.
Two-thirds of students live in university accommodation. First-year
students are guaranteed a place in hall.
With the exception of the medical science course, students are
admitted to one of the three faculties (arts, divinity or science). They
are not restricted to the course on their Ucas form. Our traditional
Scottish system allows you to sample subjects in the first and second
years before having to make a final decision about your choice of
Honours degree. A new modular system of courses means even more
flexibility and choice, plus easier credit transfer. Small-group
teaching, in tutorials and seminars, is a major feature of academic
programmes. Courses to choose from include: international relations,
social anthropology, management, mathematics and computing. All academic
departments have vigorous research programmes. St Andrews graduates are
much sought after by employers.
The Scottish Agricultural College
The national college for food, land and environmental studies offers
three different places to study: Aberdeen, Auchincruive (Ayr) and
Edinburgh. It offers courses in subjects such as leisure, tourism and
conservation as well as in food production, horticulture and scientific
subjects such as biotechnology. The college specialises in
''vocational'' courses designed to fit you for a job and a career.
SAC has more than 1000 full-time students and many more part-time and
short course students. It has its own commercial enterprises related to
the rural sector -- farms, woodlands, gardens, listed buildings,
commercial and amenity horticultural units -- and all the usual sport
and leisure facilities. Accommodation is available in halls of
residence, though this cannot be guaranteed.
The SAC, Aberdeen
It is on the University of Aberdeen campus and you will be a
matriculated student of Aberdeen University, entitled to use all its
facilities.
SAC, Auchincruive
The college campus, three miles from the centre of Ayr, is ideally
suited for education and training, with the college farm, poultry farm
and the estate grounds and gardens providing outstanding natural
resources for the taught courses. The estate's amenity areas and
woodlands also lend themselves to the development of the environmental
and conservation courses that are increasingly becoming part of the
college's provision.
SAC, Edinburgh
The college is sited on the science campus of the University of
Edinburgh on the south side of the city, and as a student at SAC
Edinburgh you will also be able to join the Edinburgh University Union,
focus of student life at the university. Access to the campus is good,
with regular bus services from all parts of the city.
The Scottish College of Textiles
Now the Faculty of Textile of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, the
college is housed in purpose-built premises on a single campus on the
outskirts of the market and industrial town of Galashiels in the
Scottish Borders. It is recognised as a leading national and
international centre in its specialist fields of study.
A wide range of industrially sponsored research activities and special
short courses for industry maintain the college's high profile in
textiles and related fields. Students use some of the best equipped
textile, clothing and colour chemistry facilities in Europe, with access
to some of the latest, dedicated micro-computer apparatus and processing
equipment.
Excellent opportunities are available for textile design and fashion
design management, for which the college enjoys an international
reputation, and for the study of a range of business, management and
computing areas. The college is well-equipped with micro-computers and
is heavily involved in computer-aided design. There are two academic
departments of the college -- Textiles and Management Studies -- each
offering diploma or degree courses. Degree courses lead to the award of
honours degrees of Heriot-Watt University.
All courses share a practical and vocational emphasis. Halls of
residence offer accommodation, and the college also manages flats for
students. Wherever possible first-year students are placed in halls.
The University of Stirling
The university is situated on a large attractive campus two miles from
Stirling and lies at the very heart of Scotland. Central features of
Stirling's beautiful campus are Airthrey Castle and Airthrey Loch.
Lochside residences accommodate almost 2300 students in halls.
The academic session comprises two 15-week semesters. Undergraduate
degrees of BA, BAcc and BSc are available as is a range of postgraduate
degrees. Stirling operates exchange schemes with the US. the
American-style semester system means that credit-transfer presents no
difficulties. There are students from more than 70 countries on campus.
The university's flexible academic system allows students to change the
emphasis of their degree programmes, if they wish, as their interests
develop. There is a university policy of continuous assessment in all
subjects, with grades being derived from coursework as well as
examinations. The concurrent study of Education and teacher training
results in academic and teaching qualifications being achieved more
quickly than elsewhere.
Major areas include accounting, business/management, marketing,
computing, economics, sociology/social policy/social work, arts and
humanities (including Japanese studies); aquaculture, and ecology.
Stirling has taken the lead in bringing together audio, video, print,
computing, telecommunications and library facilities into an integrated
information service to support students, researchers and teachers. For
media-related studies there are well-equipped language laboratories,
sound and TV studios, print unit, and multi-media facilities.
University accommodation is guaranteed for all first-year students
needing it. The loch is used for sailing, wind-surfing, angling and
canoeing, and there is a nine-hole golf course on campus. Competitive
sports bursaries are available.
The University of Strathclyde
Strathclyde University is recognised as one of the most important
institutions in advanced research and technical education in Europe but
it is also very strong in arts, social studies and education. The
university has a prestigious Faculty of Education, following merger with
Jordanhill College of Education.
Scotland's third biggest university, Strathclyde has a flexible course
structure. Courses are credit-based and modular, allowing students to
pick the selection of classes most suited to their interests. Links with
industry are strong and there are many opportunities for students to
carry out industrial placements.
The city-centre campus is known as the John Anderson Campus, in the
heart of Glasgow. The 1700 students who are housed in the student
village on campus are only five minutes away from laboratories and
lecture theatres. The university has made a large investment in
computers, software and networking.
The Jordanhill Campus occupies a 67-acre parkland site on the west
side of the city with magnificent views over the Clyde estuary. Although
the twin peaks of the impressive David Stow Building are the first to
catch the eye, most of the teaching takes place on the newer buildings
on campus. There are three halls of residence and a wide range of
facilities which include a library, theatre, swimming pools, gymnasia
and sports grounds.

FRANCESCA FEARON reports on the return to Glasgow of a collection that
combines the glamour of Casablanca and the masculine chic of Wall
Street.
ON Saturday a familiar name returns to the spot it first occupied in
Glasgow's Buchanan Street in early 1991. Episode, the New Yorker brand
name, swiftly established itself in the early 1990s as the place to buy
cool, pared-down clothing for the working wardrobe.
Its fresh, understated look reflected then as it does now the easy,
relaxed style of American design, yet neatly picks up on fashion's
styling return to suit dressing this season.
Episode is one of a stable of collections -- including the weekend
line Excursion (also available in the new Glasgow shop), Jessica, and
Jesire, the new funky collection for professional women -- owned by Hong
Kong's largest privately-owned clothing manufacturers Toppy.
Episode is designed in Milan and at its New York headquarters by three
designers who have notched up an impressive curriculum vitae between
them which includes Sonia Rykiel, Armani, Ralph Lauren, and a number of
top American sportswear labels. Not surprisingly, their collection
gently blends the transatlantic cross section of influences to create an
international look that slips into the lifestyle of career women from
Hong Kong to Houston and New York to Glasgow.
There are many looks filtering through fashion this season and there
is certainly a hint of retro in the sweet Audrey Hepburn button-through
dresses and cropped jackets in innocent-looking ice-cream colours from
the current collection.
But above all Episode means business. The collection, available also
at the Episode concession in Frasers, combines the glamour of Casablanca
and the masculine chic of Wall Street. It is no accident that Episode
chose Isabella Rossellini, Ingrid Bergman's daughter, for their
advertising campaign.
Tailoring inclines towards the relaxed -- collarless, slim jackets and
wide trousers -- keeping construction to a minimum and using light
fabrics like silk cord, cool wool, and a luxurious silk Charmeuse for
the drop-dead white shirt. There are also the classically elegant
palazzo  pants and prettily coloured twinsets in sugar-almond shades.
The menswear influence permeates the Excursion collection, Episode's
sister label. Slouchy, loose jackets, linen pinstriping and pintucked
shirts are mixed with crisp cotton gaberdine and cotton knits. Fluid
silks and inky batik prints soften the effect to create that welcome
casual ease when the business suit is finally hung up at the end of the
week.
* Exclusively to readers of The Herald, Episode is offering the first
50 readers who make purchases in their new shop at 78 Buchanan Street
from May 20, a 10% discount and the immediate enrolment into their
special VIP scheme. Episode's VIP scheme is normally offered to
customers who spend over #1000 in any three months period. Membership
entitles the holder to a 10% discount on any non-reduced merchandise at
Episode outlets around the world. Readers should present this article at
the Glasgow shop.

Barclay McBain reports on an initiative for parents of new students at
Strathclyde University which may be the first of its kind in Britain
LLANDUDNO hoteliers Alex and Penny Gamez made a 600-mile round trip to
Scotland from Wales last week to visit the university at which their
daughter Kate hopes to study. Their journey to Strathclyde University in
Glasgow was prompted by a letter from Dr Elinor Arbuthnott, wife of the
Principal, Professor John Arbuthnott.
Dr Arbuthnott is a Glasgow University graduate with many years'
experience as a teacher of undergraduates. She also knows about higher
education as a parent of three children, two of whom have gone through
the sector, the third of whom is in the middle of it.
So she knows what she is talking about when she argues that
universities and colleges have not done enough for parents and families,
both of which, she believes, have an important role to play in providing
students with much-needed support.
In April Dr Arbuthnott wrote to the families of potential
undergraduates -- who had indicated in their Ucas forms that the
university was a possible choice for their higher education -- to invite
them to a series of information sessions covering such matters as
student finance, careers, courses, and accommodation.
She wrote: ''We understand the anxieties that parents and families
have. Higher education is a venture into what may well be unknown
territory, and our purpose in developing this programme is to offer a
unique and practical insight into the personal, financial, study, and
emotional needs of students at the University of Strathclyde. We will do
our best to answer any questions that occur to you about higher
education during the session as our aim is to be as open and friendly as
possible.''
The university believes it is the first in Britain to undertake such
an initiative. Alex and Penny Gamez were among about 200 parents and
family members who attended the first meeting last Wednesday night. They
were greatly impressed and contrasted their experience at Strathclyde
with the input -- or lack of input -- from other universities, when
their son as well as their daughter set about choosing a course and a
place at which to study.
''Elsewhere we got absolutely nothing. You don't feel part of it,''
said Mrs Gamez. ''Here you feel that you're more part of it. I think
this is an excellent idea and I hope other universities will do the
same. We got useful information to help us help Kate plan her finances
better for her stay here. We did not get much information on residences,
but the university will send that on to us.
''We also found the evening useful for finding out about things which
are not in the university prospectus such as piano practise, which Kate
is concerned about. This is our first visit to Glasgow so we'll be able
to see around the city as well as have a look around the university.''
Kate has a conditional offer from Strathclyde for the BA in outdoor
education in the community. She is keen to take up a place at the
university because it is the course she wants to study. The choice was
hers alone, although Mr and Mrs Gamez gave her, and will continue to
provide, all the support she needs. But they did feel that the family
evening was the kind of service which could influence Kate to study at
Strathclyde if she were agonising between two institutions -- and if she
called on her parents for advice on making the choice.
The Strathclyde initiative is not, however, part of a naked
recruitment drive. Said Dr Arbuthnott: ''Invitations were sent to the
families of everyone holding an offer of admission to the university,
irrespective of whether they eventually come here. We are not trying to
persuade them to come here.
''We are trying to show those who do come that there is a mechanism
for parents to make contact if they have a problem, that they know there
is a friendly face willing to give support. We hope it will be a two-way
process. Parents will find out about what is on offer in terms of
support, but we also hope that parents and families can support us.''
A parents' guide to being a student, prepared by Lin McLean of the
university's student advisory and counselling service, and Bill Johnston
of the centre for academic practice explains that parents can, and do,
support their children while they are at university.
''Perhaps the useful approach is to help them (that is, students) to
help themselves, so that they grow and develop as independent adults
able to make the most of the opportunities offered by higher
education,'' says the guide. It explains that students need support in
five main areas:
* Finance, including such matters as budgeting, debt, grants, and
loans.
* Academic, including course work, study methods, workload, and exams.
* Personal matters such as health and careers.
* Interpersonal issues such as relationships.
* Accommodation, including type and cost.
Based on a rapid trawl of attitudes at the first information meeting,
financial matters seemed to be the main area of concern for parents and
families.
Dr Arbuthnott is in no doubt about the value of involving families in
the student experience. ''It is about informing choice, but also giving
information about how a university is run, not necessarily our
university,'' she said. She recalled making a visit with her husband to
a North American university which was actively seeking to involve
parents, albeit for an entirely different reason -- fundraising.
''I have seen higher education from all angles. I was a student, then
I was a university teacher, and I have had three children in the sector.
I remember saying to the Principal in North America, 'parental
involvement is something which is missing.' We felt there was a slot
which we could try to fill.''
When Dr Arbuthnott was accepted by Glasgow University to study
chemistry no approach was made to her parents to establish if they would
wish to visit the institution. ''I do not think either of them would
have wanted to go to find out about it,'' she said. Her father left
school at 12 and became a butcher. He was a self-taught man with a great
admiration for higher learning, so it was assumed that his daughter
would go to university. Dr Arbuthnott's mother did a law degree in the
evenings.
Despite being the mother of three children who became students, Dr
Arbuthnott found that, in her experience, there was no parental
involvement. ''My only involvement was filling up the direct debit form
and that was it,'' she joked.
She recalled helping her daughter move into halls of residence when
she went to university. ''I was unloading her stuff and she was taking a
long time, so I went to see what she was doing. I came across a notice
inviting parents to come along and find out about university if they had
nothing to do. I would not have known about this if I had not gone to
find out what my daughter was doing. There was no direct approach to
me.''
It would not happen at Strathclyde. ''This university is a family at
all levels. We aim to have, and I would think we succeed in having, a
friendly, approachable image. We would like to make parents feel at home
here,'' said Dr Arbuthnott.
* We wish to acknowledge Strathclyde University as the source of the
mind map in last week's issue of Choices. Many thanks go to Lin McLean
and Bill Johnston.

VETERAN Scotland keeper Jim Leighton was named yesterday as the
captain of the scratch international squad which flies out to Japan
today, writes Ken Gallacher.
Yet Leighton himself admitted:''I don't really think that a goalkeeper
makes the best captain because you are so far away from the play. I
might need a megaphone, or throat lozenges!''
Still, he has been handed the job and while he has been named as
captain before, that was a gesture when he collected his fiftieth cap.
Yesterday, though, Scotland manager Craig Brown went to great lengths
to stress the player's qualities which determined his choice.
''Jim Leighton,''he said,''is not just an on-field captain he is also
a perfect ambassador for Sottish football. I have no worries at all
about having a goalkeeper as captain. After all, he is in a position
where he sees the game spread out in front of him.
''In any case he is the most experienced player in the group and he
will pass all of that on to the other young lads who will be with us.''
The Hibs keeper said: ''I am looking forward to this trip. I look
forward to every game, in the summer or not, after my experiences with
Manchester United and Aberdeen. I would be happy if the season just went
on forever. I don't want to stop playing.
''I don't want to miss anything any more. The young lads coming on
this trip should look at things the same way. I only had my chance when
there was an injury to Andy Goram -- other players have got into the
team that way and that has to be their incentive.''
Leighton also accepted a cheque yesterday for #1,000 after playing
over six Scottish Cup hours of football without conceding a goal. It was
the semi final replay against Celtic before the new Scotland skipper was
beaten.
Meanwhile, as he gathered his depleted squad around him, Craig Brown
stubbornly defended the journey. And he maintained: ''We will bring in
maybe seven players for the match against the Faroes next month and it's
possible some of the younger players will step aside for them.
''But the chance is there for these youngsters to come into the squad
for the European Championship game.''
Initially, Brown had pencilled in the games in Japan, against the host
nation and Ecuador, as a vital warm-up for the trip to the Faroes on
June 6.
That has altered -- but Brown still sees value in the journey. He
points out: ''We have to have squad players still in action for this
period. And we have half a dozen players who would always have been in
the pool of players for the game in the Faroes.
''We also have players back home who will be playing in important
games and who will then be ready for the match.''
As well as the fledgling stars, of course, Brown has more experienced
men who would like to press their claims. Derek Whyte of Middlesbrough
is one, after being called in to take over from Blackburn's Colin
Hendry, and Billy McKinlay, John Spencer, and the Motherwell pair of
Brian Martin and Rob McKinnon are others mentioned yesterday by Brown as
candidates for promotion to permanent places in his Scotland side.
Brown has been particularly impressed by McKinlay's willingness to go
on the trip after his club, Dundee United, were relegated. Said Brown:
''Billy has been tremendous. He is up for the trip and he really wants
to go and make an impression.
''OK, he is upset about what has happened to him at club level, but I
don't think that will have any effect on his play with Scotland.''

FOR 14 years, John Hansen followed his son Alan around the world to
watch the classy defender win a stack of medals with Liverpool FC.
John, 70, is rightly proud of his son's achievements with club and
country. But yesterday he clutched his own medal and relived his own
moment of glory as a player in the 1952 Scottish Junior Cup final.
He was centre half in the Camelon side who lost 1-0 to Kilbirnie
Ladeside, and will be a guest of the Falkirk club when they meet
Whitburn in Sunday's final at Fir Park.
May 17, 1952, is a day he will never forget. ''It was a fairy-tale for
me then. There was a crowd of 70,000 in 1952 and I was used to playing
in front of 200 every game. Hundreds of buses and a special train took a
massive support from Falkirk. But once the game started, I never even
knew the crowd was there.
''Still, they'll all be keyed up for Sunday and my advice is to go out
and enjoy themselves. They've done the hard part by getting there. As
Alan says -- who ever remembers semi-final losers?''
The 1952 team were each paid #20 -- and a steak pie. Falkirk District
Council called off a civic reception after the team lost. So, Myles, the
local butchers, supplied the pies as a consolation gift.
John, whose other son, John Jr, played for Partick Thistle and
Scotland, added: ''Although my final was 43 years ago, I remember it
like yesterday. Jackie Dunbar, who went on to play with Aberdeen, scored
the goal, and Donnie McQueen -- whose son, Gordon, went on to play for
Manchester United and Scotland -- was Kilbirnie's goalkeeper. We just
couldn't get the ball past him.''
John met his old rival again at Hampden 25 years later, and they were
on the same side as they shouted on their sons in a Scotland game.
1  Now John is looking forward to Sunday's big game at Motherwell,
linking up with his old team-mates, and cheering on Camelon.

PARMA may hold a one-goal advantage going into this evening's UEFA Cup
final second leg in Milan, but according to Juventus striker Gianluca
Vialli, the sides will be on level terms when the ball starts rolling.
Despite playing their home leg away from Turin because of a
disagreement between the club and stadium administrators about ground
advertising revenue, Juventus are expecting a full house of more than
82,000. And with most of them Juventus supporters, Vialli believes that
such an advantage in sound could be woth a goal to his side.
''At the San Siro we'll start off level since they have a goal
advantage but we'll have 70,000 fans on our side,'' he said.
''Psychologically, though, we have the upper hand because this is the
game of the season for them, while we have the insurance policy of a
league title practically won.''
However, not surprisingly, Parma keeper Luca Bucci sees things
differently. ''Vialli is an old fox who is just saying that to frighten
us,'' he said. ''Everybody wants to win . . . and as far as I'm
concerned I still believe we can win the league, too.''
Both sides will be without important players. Juventus's German
defender Juergen Kohler and midfielder Antonio Conte are injured, while
midfielders Alessio Tacchinardi and Frenchman Didier Deschamps are
serving one-match suspensions.
Parma miss Argentine utility man Nestor Sensini, defender Luigi
Apolloni, and midfielder Gabriele Pin, who are suspended, while Swedish
midfield player Tomas Brolin is not considered fit enough for such a
tough match.
The clubs meetin another crucial clash on Sunday when the Italian
league title could be decided. Juventus have a seven-point lead at the
top over second-placed Parma with just three games to play.

* JURGEN Klinsmann returned to Germany yesterday to sign a three-year
contract with Bayern Munich. The striker said he was ready for new
challenges after having turned his back Tottenham Hotspur.
''It is a special incentive for me to go after a title,'' he said. ''I
have never been champion or cup winner.''
The contract, which takes effect on July 1, pays Klinsmann #1.1m a
year, as much as Bayern's top earner Lothar Matthaeus. He also receives
a one-off payment of #1.3m.
That is a lot of money, but Bayern vice president Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge believes that it will be cash well spent. ''If Juergen scores
only half the goals he made at Tottenham, we will be very satisfied,''
he said.

BRIAN Horton yesterday became the twelfth manager this season to part
company with an English Premiership club when he was sacked by
Manchester City.
The club denied a report that Horton had been told he was going by
chairman Francis Lee following Sunday's 3-2 home defeat by Queen's Park
Rangers. But the club announced he was leaving at lunchtime yesterday.
The news comes less than 24 hours after Alan Smith had ''mutually
agreed'' to leave Crystal Palace.
Horton was called to Maine Road for a meeting with Lee. Afterwards,
the club issued a statement which read: ''After amiable talks with the
chairman, it was decided that, in the best interests of the club, the
manager should go.''
City started the season well but a slump around Christmas plunged them
into trouble and they eventually finished seventeenth -- four points
clear of the relegation zone.

TORY candidate John Godfrey last night admitted that he was urging
voters on the doorsteps to vote for any candidate except the SNP in next
week's by-election in Perth and Kinross.
After a television crew filmed him telling one woman: ''I don't mind
who you vote for as long as you don't vote SNP,'' Mr Godfrey said this
was a legitimate tactic given the overriding concern of saving the
Union.
However, other parties poured scorn on this tactic, citing it as proof
that the Tories were throwing in the towel in the constituency which
they had held under the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
''This is yet another panicked and devious Tory attempt to get off the
hook,'' said Mr Michael Russell, the SNP chief executive. ''John Godfrey
knows that a split vote is the only chance of saving his political skin
and that of his party.
''He believes the Tories can sneak back in, if he can deflect votes
from his only real challenger, the SNP. But, like every other ploy in
his campaign, this trick is doomed to failure. All he is doing now is
exposing the deep seated anti-Scottish nature of his campaign.''
Mr Douglas Alexander, the Labour candidate, said: ''This is a crude
attempt to make this by-election a constitutional showdown, so it
bolsters the SNP and themselves and talks down everyone else. All our
evidence shows that people are judging the campaign on a whole range of
other issues and moving straight across from Tory to Labour.''
Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign manager,
said: ''I'm not sure whether an endorsement from John Godfrey is a
blessing or a curse but it is a measure of the Tories' desperation.
''John Godfrey knows he has lost the arguments in this election and he
seems only too aware that he is losing votes by the barrowload. This is
the first time in 20 years that I have known a by-election candidate
actively to endorse other parties.''
Mr Godfrey said it was a perfectly fair point to make. ''I always made
it quite clear that it was a head-to-head race here with the SNP. If
people are left wing in their inclination then that is fair enough. It
is up to them to decide to vote for a Liberal or socialist programme,
but I think it would be dangerous to vote for separatism.
''If you want to register a protest do so, but don't give support to
the idea of smashing up the UK, because the UK matters more than a
protest against temporary unhappiness over the Government of the day.''
He was speaking before a public meeting at a Perth primary school last
night, where he was supported by Lord Younger of Prestwick, who once
withdrew as Tory candidate in this constituency to make way for the then
Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas Home.
In spite of several changes of direction by the Tories on the issue of
devolution since then, Lord Younger insisted the party did a service to
Scottish democracy by holding fast to its principled stance in favour of
the Union.
His speech last night warned the electorate that constitutional change
would represent a disaster for Scottish business. ''The effect of either
devolution or worse still, independence, would be profound and
lasting,'' he said.
''At a stroke, the stable economic environment in which Scottish
business presently flourishes would be swept away.'' This threat to
industry posed by constitutional change was the theme of the day for the
Conservatives, with Industry Minister George Kynoch and former CBI
chairman Mr Alistair Mair of Caithness Glass, both speaking in support
of Mr Godfrey.
The candidate himself said, in a reference to his SNP rival Ms
Roseanna Cunningham: ''If Republican Rose is committed to her party's
socialist manifesto and its outlandish spending pledges, there is no way
she can give any guarantee for the future stability of business within
Perth and Kinross.''
However, Ms Cunningham was critical of the tone of campaign conducted
by the Conservatives. She said that, as someone with experience of being
both a migrant and an immigrant, she was grateful for the support of the
group New Scots For Independence, which is made up of people who have
chosen to come to Scotland to make their life here.
Describing the Tory campaign as nasty and negative, tawdry and
contradictory, she said: ''In their silly attacks on me they have in
effect decried the contribution made to Scotland by those with
experience of elsewhere.''
Labour's theme for the day was rural policy and the party launched a
discussion document, A Fair Deal For Scotland's Countryside. Mr
Alexander said a working party on the subject would be set up by Labour
to examine the issues and he claimed that the party was increasingly
building its reputation for rural policy. He was supported by Shadow
Agriculture Minister, Gavin Strang, who said the Tories had forfeited
any claim to represent rural Scotland.
He said such policies as attempts to privatise the Post Office and
Forestry Commission had been resisted successfully by Labour giving the
party the trust of rural communities.
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, stepped up their attack on the front
runners in the campaign, the SNP. SLD leader Jim Wallace, supporting
candidate Veronica Linklater, said it was time that the SNP were forced
to spell out some of the economic consequences of separation.

DUNDEE United, who have plunged out of the premier division for the
first time, have ambitious plans to carry the club back into the big
time immediately.
United do not want an extended stay in the first division and the
signing strategies now being laid out by manager Billy Kirkwood with the
full support of the club chairman, Jim McLean, and his fellow directors
are aimed at taking them back to the top flight inside a season.
I understand that the Tannadice club are readying an audacious attempt
to bring Darren Jackson back to Tayside. The Hibs man has gone to Japan
with Scotland along with his Easter Road manager, Alex Miller, but
United are determined to buy the player who left for Hibs two years ago.
The asking price, which may come close to a million pounds, will not
deter them. There is money to be spent at Tannadice if the right players
are available.
It may seem, on the surface, a backwards step for Jackson, who has
just pushed his way into the Scotland side -- but United refuse to allow
relegation to affect their status.
They will be ready to pay the right money to clubs to buy players, and
the right salaries to players to convince them that their futures lie at
Tannadice.
Jackson tops their summer shopping list, but they also would like to
bring Celtic and former Scotland internationalist keeper Gordon Marshall
to the club after having watched him in his last three reserve games.
The news yesterday from Kirkwood that two of his current keepers,
Kelham O'Hanlon and Henrik Jorgensen, can leave accelerates their
interest in Marshall.
The anticipated clear-out at United will go ahead. Even Scottish Cup
final hero Craig Brewster has been told he can leave if a club makes a
suitable bid. Earlier this season, Norwich wanted Brewster and now, as
they try to rebuild for their own attack on promotion, they could
return.
The Trinidad forward, Jerren Nixon, crazily priced at #15m by former
manager Ivan Golac, also will leave, but at a fraction -- a minute
fraction -- of the value previously claimed.
Steven Pressley, once with Kirkwood at Ibrox and now at Coventry, also
is on the Tannadice wanted list. And the money is there to spend, just
as it was when Golac was there.
Golac spent more than #2m and still the club went down. Now the board
and Kirkwood will look for value-for-money signings, and the men they
have targetted are Jackson, Marshall, and Pressley.
I believe they have set their sights deliberately high to underline to
any players they want that they do not intend to remain second-class
citizens for any longer than a season.

JOE Royale, the Everton manager, is confident striker Duncan Ferguson
will play a part in Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley.
Ferguson has scored eight times for the Goodison Park side since
joining them from Rangers for #4m but his season has since been upset by
suspension, injury, and a court appearance in Scotland.
An operation looked to have ended his season, but a 45-minute
appearance in Sunday's draw at Coventry proved that Ferguson still was
in with a chance of a Wembley display.

TWO of the country's leading National Hunt jockeys were in deep water
with the sport's authorities at racing's headquarters yesterday, and
took their leave of Portman Square with heavy hearts.
Norman Williamson, winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion
Hurdle, has been banned for 14 days. The Irishman, who has ridden 128
winners this term, picked up the suspension after having been found
guilty of causing intentional interference on River Tarquin, who
finished second to Strath Royal at in a chase at Uttoxeter earlier this
month.
The jump season finishes on June 3, so with Adrian Maguire sidelined
through injury, the ban effectively seals the jockeys' championship for
Richard Dunwoody, who leads the table with 148 winners.
The Uttoxeter stewards decided that River Tarquin had crossed Strath
Royal at the third last, preventing jockey Martin Brennan from
maintaining his position on the inside.
If Williamson was not happy, Richard Guest could have few complaints
after having been banned for nine days following his third whip offence
of the season.
Guest, who admitted he used his whip with unreasonable frequency on
Eden Stream at Sedgefield on May 5, is suspended from May 19 to 30.
But it was not just the top men who were in trouble, the officials
certainly did not miss conditional Gary Cahill who was appearing before
them after his fourth whip offence of the season.
Cahill, who will be in action at Perth this evening, was banned for 14
days after having admitted he used his whip with unreasonable force,
frequency, and with his whip arm above shoulder height on German Legend
at Hexham earlier this month.

SCOTLAND, failed to improve on their overnight ninth position when the
Golf Foundation International Team Championship for Schools final
reached its conclusion yesterday at Sunningdale.
Australia (Kelvin Grove High School from Queensland) took the R&amp;A
Trophy for the first time, ending a remarkable five-year victory run by
the French school Lycee Bellevue.
One consolation for the French was that in Olivier David they provided
the individual champion, his 142 aggregate achieved thanks mainly to
yesterday's 69. Leading aggregates:
439 -- Australia (Kelvin Grove High School, Queensland: T Johns 143, E
Ryan 148, D Nendick 148). 446 -- France. 460 -- Germany. 465 -- New
Zealand. 466 -- England (Meridian High School, Royston: M Rogers 146, L
Rogers 152, J Hubbard 168). 468 -- Ireland (Presentation College, Bray:
A Murray 155, P Kirby 156, K Condran 157); India. 477 -- South Africa.
480 -- Scotland (Dollar Academy: S Whiteford 154, P Whiteford 158, C

THE resurgence of Sharon McMaster's amateur career continued apace
yesterday when she took the first-round lead in the Scottish Women's
Amateur Golf Championship at Portpatrick Dunskey with a two-under-par 69
-- the only sub-par score from a field of 90.
The Dunbar player took advantage of unusually tame conditions across
the Galloway linksland course to move two ahead of two-handicapper
Catherine Malcolm of Prestwick St Cuthbert and four clear of a cluster
of five on 73, reducing her handicap to scratch in the process.
The internationalist had quickly laid the foundations for her round
with a straightforward birdie at the short opening hole and an eagle at
the 405 yard fifth, where she fired a No.5-iron shot to 25 feet and
calmly rolled in the putt. Though the 34-year-old overcooked her
approach to the tenth for a bogey, she completed her round in par.
Since quitting her job with Standard Life three years ago, the former
East Lothian county champion has been able to devote more time to her
sport -- a move which has, though perhaps not financially, paid
dividends.
Last year McMaster was recalled to the Scotland side for the Home
Internationals for the first time in 10 years, and already this season
she has finished a best ever sixth in the prestigous Helen Holm Scottish
Women's Strokeplay championship at Troon.
Currently sitting on top of the Laing the Jeweller Order of Merit, she
added: ''Since I stopped working full-time, I have been able to dedicate
more time to the game and, as a result, I practice more and am more
relaxed when I play.''
With just one remaining strokeplay qualifying round today before the
matchplay stages commence, McMaster presents a strong challenge for the
title. She exited last year's competition in Gullane at the
quarter-final stage and reached the semi-finals in 1988.
Despite driving poorly, former champion Alison Gemmill of Kilmarnock
Barassie opened her account across the 5532-yard course with a
respectable 75 to tie for eighth place. Afterwards, though, she hoped
conditions would worsen to present a sterner challenge.
She said: ''The course was playing as easy as it will ever play. If
the wind gets up, as it normally does here, it will make it a more
difficult test.'' Great Britain and Ireland internationalist Alison Rose
of Stirling, the highest handicap in the field on plus-two, also posted
a four-over-par 75.
Ayrshire county player Malcolm ran up a costly double bogey at the
349-yard eighth to counter two early birdies and closed with a bogey for
her level-par 71. Leading scores:
69 -- S McMaster (Dunbar).
71 -- C Malcolm (Prestwick St Cuthbert).
73 -- F de Vries (Baberton), L Nicholson (Haddington), F Anderson
(Blairgowrie), S Wood (Aberdeen Ladies), H Stirling (Bridge of Allan).
74 -- J Ford (Gullane Ladies).
75 -- J Anderson (Hawick), F F McKay (Elgin), C Hargan (Cardross), C
Hunter (Deeside), A Gemmill (Kilmarnock Barassie), H Monaghan
(Longniddry), T Stoddart (Cawder), A Rose (Stirling).
76 -- F M McKay (Turnberry), C Agnew (Glasgow University).
77 -- C MacDonald (Dunfermline), A Hunter (Innerleithen), S Lambie
(Troon Ladies).
78 -- D Jackson (Cochrane Castle), L Roxburgh (Tain), J Harrison
(Cruden Bay), K Burns (Clydedbank and District), C Divers (Douglas
Park), M Cable (Newmacher), J Balloch (Hayling), K Fitzgerald
(Turnberry), E Moffat (St. Regulus), S Booth (Portpatrick).

NEALE Cooper vowed yesterday to help destroy the last remnants of the
Pittodrie fortress he helped create.
The veteran defender can hardly believe how Aberdeen have plunged from
the pinnacle of Europe to a play-off against his Dunfermline team to
stay in the premier division.
But Cooper, who won nine trophies as a Don, including the Cup-winners'
Cup, has no sympathy for his former club.
He said: ''I had a lot of great times at Pittodrie and still cherish
the memories. But there is no sentiment in football. If they go down,
they will deserve it. Bigger clubs than Aberdeen have been relegated.
''Dunfermline will have my undivided loyalty. I just hope our manager
Bert Paton lets me in on our team talk. Unfortunately, I'll miss out
because of injury, but I'll tell our lads exactly what they are facing
and what they must do to win.
''It is up to us to keep it tight. I am very confident that we can
beat them at East End Park.

THEY may have had contrasting experiences this season, but Hibs and
Hearts are on the same wavelength when it comes to one player they want
to help their cause next term.
The Edinburgh clubs are a set to compete with others for the signature
of Morton's exciting midfield talent, Derek McInnes, who seems certain
to make the high level that had beckoned before he was devastated by a
serious knee injury over a year ago.
McInnes, who is now 23, was a young man in demand at that point, but
he has defied some of the forecasts that accompanied that injury, which
threatened to put an end to his career before it had moved into top
gear, by recapturing his best form. Now it looks as if that lift-off to
greater things has only been on hold.
As well as Hibs and Hearts, Partick Thistle and Raith Rovers are very
keen on the Greenock man, who won the Second Division Player of the Year
award at the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association dinner on
Sunday.
In fact, both Thistle and Rovers are understood to have made firm bids
for McInnes and, with a posse of English clubs also preparing to join
the race, there seems every chance that an auction will develop. Hearts
and Hibs, however, have been monitoring the form of McInnes as he and
his team-mates made their way to the league championship and promotion
to the first division, and have been in regular contact with manager
Allan McGraw.
Hibs could have a couple of advantages over their city rivals in that
their manager, Alex Miller, has some transfer cash left to use after
buying Andy Millen of Kilmarnock and could meet the #300,000 figure
likely to be required. They may not be able to go much further, however,
as they and Hearts are both still heavily involved in reconstruction
work.
The other ace the Easter Rd club may hold is Mark McGraw, son of the
Morton manager, who could be used as part of any deal to bring McInnes
to Edinburgh. McGraw, whose contract ends next month, has had a hard
time establishing a first team place in a club with strikers like Keith
Wright, Darren Jackson, Kevin Harper and Gareth Evans vying for
selection ahead of him.
It has been a marvellous season for McInnes, who could not had a more
understanding manager as he recuperated from surgery on his kneecap last
year.
Allan McGraw, who has suffered and continues to suffer great pain as a
result of football injuries which were not protected, makes sure that
none of his players is in danger of making the same mistakes that he
did.
* CELTIC had to leave one of their probable starters for the Scottish
Cup final, Rudi Vata, behind to do his own preparation in the Glasgow
chill while the rest of the squad enjoyed the sunshine of Italy this
week.
The club needed to apply for a visa for the full back, because of his
Albanian nationality, a fortnight in advance, but as they only finalised
their pre-final trip a few days ago that was not possible.
Vata's training routine will be carefully supervised by Frank Connor,
which is one other good reason why he will wish he was in Milan.

AFTER having completed a hard programme of training over the past six
weeks, the Scotland rugby squad yesterday faced an equally tough flight
schedule on their way from Edinburgh to South Africa for the 1995 Rugby
World Cup.
Instead of flying directly from London, the Scots have been routed via
Munich, where they will join up with the French squad before continuing
on to Johannesburg.
The decision to take what seems a most indirect route was made by the
Rugby World Cup organisers, who are responsible for flying the competing
nations into South Africa and who wanted to ensure that France and
Scotland, drawn together in Group D, would arrive simultaneously in
South Africa, so that neither squad could gain any acclimatisation
advantage.
Sharing company with the French on the flight from Munich to
Johannesburg, however, will not affect Ken Milne, the Scotland and
Heriot's FP hooker. ''I don't speak French and presumably very few of
them will speak English,'' declared Milne at Edinburgh Airport
yesterday. ''I'm just glad that we are finally here now and ready to
go.''
He is one of nine men from the Scotland squad which reached the
semi-final of the 1991 World Cup. This time, however, he will be the
first-choice hooker, after having lost out to John Allan four years ago.
There are only three survivors from the first cup, staged in Australia
and New Zealand in 1987, of whom only Gavin Hastings made any real
impact. As the Scotland captain recalled at the farewell dinner held at
Murrayfield on Monday night: ''My brother Scott lasted only eight
seconds before being forced to retire from the competition with a
hamstring injury, while Jeremy Richardson had the misfortune not to be
selected for any of the matches.''
Summing up the mood of the squad just before departure, Doug Morgan,
the Scotland coach, said: ''This is the culmination of a year's work in
terms of fitness and preparation. For most of us, including myself, it
will be the pinnacle of our rugby careers. All the players are in
fighting condition. We're looking forward to doing well.''
Jim Telfer, the Scotland director of rugby, added: ''Barring injuries
to players like Gary Armstrong, Gregor Townsend, and Andy Reed, we have
the best possible squad. We've prepared properly with altitude training
and extensive work on improving our aerobic base. It's up to the players
now to produce it on the day.''
The Scots will have 10 days to settle in, during which the players
will become accustomed to operating at an altitude of 6000 feet before
facing the Ivory Coast in the first of their group matches a week on
Friday in Rustenburg. The acclimatisation programme, however, will be
interrupted on Saturday, when the squad will fly to Cape Town for the
formal opening lunch -- attendance at which is obligatory.
* SOME England players will pocket around #1400 a week during the
five-week World Cup. The payments -- which, even with rugby's
restrictions, are legal -- will put the men concerned temporarily in
touch with the high earners of the Southern Hemisphere.
The bulk of the cash will come from mobile-phone company, Cellnet, who
are giving the squad of 26 ''a six-figure sum'' -- believed to be
#120,000 -- working out at #4600 per man.
Then there is the International Board allowance of #25 per day for
''communications'' and #45 per day for loss of earnings, adding up to
another #490 per week.
In addition, the squad are benefiting from the #100,000-per-year deal
with brewers Courage -- a ball-park figure of #5000 per player each
year.
Regulars in the England team -- which was unchanged throughout the
Five Nations' Championship -- made at least #10,000 through promotional
work last season.
They will scoop a minimum #6775 a man if they make the World Cup final
-- and probably another #15,000 apiece next term.
* CROWDS for the World Cup in South Africa will be significantly
higher than at the two previous tournaments despite poor overseas ticket
sales, according to the South African Rugby Football Union.
SARFU chief executive officer Edward Griffiths said today that between
400,000 and 450,000 tickets had been returned to South Africa just 10
days before the tournament was due to begin.
''Ticket sales in other countries have been disappointing,'' he said.
''But we don't see a problem.
''We (SARFU) sold our full allocation of 750,000 tickets without even
being able to offer any to the ordinary rugby fan in the street, and we
were severely criticised for it.
''We were surprised that so many tickets were returned to us so late,
but we believe that by offering 450,000 to frustrated rugby-mad
supporters here, we will be able to sell the majority of them. Crowd
figures will be much higher than in 1987 or 1991.''

ALAN Tait, director of Snookerscot, yesterday predicted a storm
warning was heading for Scotland next month.
The Fife-based promoter has lined up a three-match challenge series
involving Wishaw's John Higgins and his namesake, the two-times world
champion Alex ''Hurricane'' Higgins.
The 20-year-old Scot, ranked No.11 in the world, has pocketed #300,000
this season and eagerly awaits the showdown.
''Having played my other idol, Steve Davis, this clash with Alex will
complete an ambition of mine,'' he said.
The talented Scot, despite being outwith the top 10, won three majors
this season, clinching the Skoda Grand Prix, International Open, and
British Open.
The 46-year-old wayward Irishman, after having been disciplined and
docked 25 points to drop to world No.91, has clawed back to No.46 on the
ranking list and looks forward to the clash.
''I've heard glowing reports about young John's play, but maybe the
old maestro can still show him a thing or two,'' he said.
The series opens on June 20 at Glenrothes, goes to Wishaw the
following night, and finishes on the Friday at the Magnum Centre,
Irvine.

CHRIS Eubank hinted yesterday that he was still haunted by his 1991
fight with Michael Watson, who suffered brain damage after collapsing
following the fight.
Asked why he didn't follow up a tenth-round knockdown of Steve Collins
when he lost his WBO super-middleweight title, Eubank said: ''Throughout
my career I lived on brinkmanship and everything always went my way. I
will not answer why I did not follow up against Collins.''
When asked if it was because he feared Collins could be injured like
Watson, he snapped: ''I refuse to answer that.''
Eubank did not display his normal self-confidence at a Belfast press
conference for his comeback fight at the Kings Hall on May 27. He meets
Bruno Godoy, of Argentina, in a 10-rounder before his expected return
with Collins at Croke Park, Dublin, on July 22.
His trainer Ronnie Davies admitted that there was a specific reason
why Eubank was not at his best against Collins, but refused to give any
details.
* BOXER Jimmy Garcia has lapsed into a coma with kidney failure in Las
Vegas and his doctor said he did not think the 24-year-old Colombian
would survive. He slumped to the canvas after his May 6 defeat by WBC
super-featherweight champion Gabriel Ruelas.

THE Australian and New Zealand Rugby World Cup squads arrived in South
Africa yesterday, the first of the visiting 15 teams who will take part
in the tournament which starts next week.
Laurie Mains, the New Zealand coach, said he had the right squad to
regain the cup the All Blacks won at the inaugural 1987 tournament.
''There are 3.5m selectors in New Zealand,'' he said, ''and we don't all
think alike. But I think the general consensus is we got it about
right.''
''People understand why we couldn't pick Michael Jones and we don't
feel uncomfortable about any of our selections.'' Jones, the flank
forward from Auckland who played in the first two World Cups, was left
behind because his religious beliefs prevent him playing on Sundays.
Manager Brian Lochore said fitness doubts about Zinzan Brooke were
unfounded. ''Zinzan had a fitness test on Sunday and our medical staff
have assured us that by this week he will be fit and available for
selection.''
New Zealand play their opening fixture against Ireland in Johannesburg
on May 27.
In Cape Town, defending champions Australia were welcomed to their
hotel by crowds of fans. They play in the tournament's opening game,
against South Africa, on May 25.
However, Bob Dwyer, the Australia coach, declined to pick a favourite
for the tournament. ''I thought England produced the best form of all
the World Cup teams in their most recent games,'' he said.
''Their form in the Five Nations' championship was superior to the
domestic form displayed by South Africa, Australia, and others over the
last few months. But I don't mind who is favourite for the World Cup as
I won't be having a bet.''
Dwyer admitted Australia would be under pressure as defending
champions. ''Since 1992, we've recognised we'll be under pressure, and
when we won in 1991, we spoke of the increasing pressure we'd
experience,'' he said. ''One thing we know is that a serious challenge
in this tournament will be South Africa.
As far as the Australia squad was concerned, Dwyer said that the only
slight worries were Troy Coker, who has a lower-back injury, and Scott
Bowen, suffering from a pelvic injury.
''Come Thursday, at our first full training session, I expect 26
players to be 100% fit,'' added Dwyer.

FIVE years ago Scotland claimed a historic victory over Northants at
the County Ground. And yesterday, after one Malcom Marshall over, all
thoughts were of the Scots completing a memorable double.
Sadly thereafter, like the sun, Scotland's dreams drifted behind the
clouds, the eventual outcome going in the favour of the county side by
153 runs to complete a miserable campaign for the amateurs.
It had all started so well when Marshall removed Russell Warren for a
duck with the score on 1, the opener finding Ian Stanger at point.
However Northants piled up an impressive total of 304 for six by the
end of their 55 overs, with the bulk of those runs coming in an superb
second-wicket stand of 164 between Alan Fordham and Rob Bailey.
Fordham crashed his way to a boundary-laden century, his 108 made off
121 balls and included two 6s and fifteen 4s.
When Fordham was eventually out, man-of-the-match Bailey then indulged
in a quick-fire third-wicket stand of 59 in just 38 minutes with Tim
Walton, as the county side scored at will.
Their large tally also owed something to the 41 extras contributed by
the Scots, although wicket keeper David Haggo can be excused much of the
blame as he spent much of the day -- and no doubt much of the next week
-- nursing a dislocated thumb.
The Ayrshire stumper damaged his finger attempting to take a leg side
delivery off the bowling of Greig Williamson. Jim Love took over behind
the sticks, but after a stoppage for rain, the Scotland captain gave way
to Williamson, who promptly dropped Tony Penberthy.
With Haggo injured, Scotland had to bat a man short. But it did not
affect the eventual outcome. For the third time in four innings Steve
Crawley departed early, the West Lothian opener trapped leg before.
The Scotland total had advanced to 20 in the tenth over by the time
Alistair Storie took the long walk, his contribution, like Crawley's,
zero. George Reifer had made 17 by that point, thanks to a variety of
text-book and unorthodox shots.
After that flurry however, things went very quiet for the Uddingston
pro. Partner Mike Smith created a bit more of a stir, producing shots
every bit as extravagant as his batting partner.
The Reifer-Smith combination added 50 before Smith skied a catch to
Penberthy, having made 35. From then, the Scots' innings could best be
described as tedious.
The Northants spin combination of Bailey and Jeremy Snape must have
created something of a record when they whizzed through their allocation
of 22 overs in just 48 minutes as the Scots batsmen patted the ball back
down the wicket with regularity.
Williamson and Marshall headed back to the pavilion in quick
succession to leave Scotland on 123 for five after 48 overs. All that
was left was for Reifer to complete his 50, which he managed to grind
out off 172 balls.

SOMERSET crushed Ireland by 233 runs at Eglinton yesterday -- but it
may not be enough to give them a place in the Benson and Hedges Cup
quarter-finals. They have to rely on Group D leaders Kent beating Sussex
at Hove in a game to be completed today.
Marcus Trescothick smashed 122 of Somerset's 316 for five and held
four slip catches -- but it was Graham Rose who took the gold award
after scoring 47 not out off 48 balls and taking the the top four Irish
wickets for 21 runs.
The other eight ties were all disrupted by the weather, but not before
Bill Athey wrote himself into the Sussex record books as his side made
303 for six. Athey struck 118 -- the highest score by a Sussex player in
the competition -- cracking ten 4s off 156 balls.
Graham Gooch struck a superb unbeaten century as Essex reached 211 for
four in 49 overs against Hampshire at Southampton in Group C. He was 117
not out when rain halted proceedings.

THE somewhat sordid side of American football came to light recently
when it was widely reported that, instead of hiring the best medical
staff they could for their players, some teams are allowing medical
companies to bid for the privilege of being ''official team doctor.''
Two new teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers,
have reportedly been most guilty of this practice, promoting a bidding
war instead of conducting what many feel should have been a stringent
selection process.
The prestige of being associated with a pro team is so great that one
company promised the Jaguars $4.8m over five years, plus $500,000 a year
in advertising in the game programmes, plus the salaries of three Jaguar
trainers. That particular company was one of the ones that was turned
down.
* NEWS from the National Basketball Association casts the National
Football League in a still worse light. A number of professional
basketball players, it seems, have been quietly doing the unthinkable:
giving away some of their hard earned fortunes to worthwhile causes.
Chris Dudley, of the Portland Trailblazers, gave $300,000 to the I
Have A Dream Foundation and donated another $150,000 to diabetes
research, a condition from which he suffers.
Jamal Mashburn of the Dallas Mavericks gave $500,000 out of his shoe
contract to his old college, the University of Kentucky, and he forked
out another $360,000 to buy backboards for all 201 schools in central
Dallas.
The best example of all, though, may have come from Kevin Johnson of
the Phoenix Suns. He founded a charitable organisation in his home town
of Sacramento and established a college scholarship fund. Furthering
that educational cause, he often refuses to sign autographs for children
until they answer a maths problem for him.
* JIMMY Connors is the grand old man of United States tennis and his
Champions Tour, a circuit for former pros who have passed the age of 35,
is gathering large and enthusiastic crowds.
Connors and other one-time superstars go head to head in matches that
recall the glory days of the sport.
Inevitably, Connors is the star of each tournament, being the
two-year-old Tour's founder and its most successful participant. Thus
far he has been defeated just twice, once through illness and, most
recently, in a 6-1, 7-5 loss to John McEnroe in Moscow.
Connors' greatest problem is how to keep the Tour competitive while
maintaining his position atop its rankings. It's a dilemma he appears
not to have resolved yet.
''Nothing would please me more than to have Bjorn Borg beat me next
time out,'' he commented recently. ''But I'm not going to let him.''
* SENIOR officials in American athletics circles are scratching their
heads bemusedly and wondering why the Mobil Oil Corporation is refusing
to hand over $1.25m in 1996, as it did this year, to sponsor a series of
five televised indoor athletics meetings.
Spectators at last March's Mobil 1 Invitational in Fairfax, Virginia,
may have the answer. Fairfax is home to Mobil's world headquarters and
the meeting on their own turf is one of the flagships of the indoor
season.
Imagine then the chagrin of a Mobil executive leafing through the
event's programme only to find an advertisement for a Shell credit card.
Reportedly, Mobil is reviewing its commitment to athletics worldwide.
* BEFORE the recent baseball umpires' strike was resolved, substitutes
were used until the real professionals could get back into the action.
Eric Gregg, one of the latter, was asked how the fans should react to
the temporary replacements.
''Just do what you always do,'' he responded. ''Boo the umpires, only
do it a little louder.''

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi, the Scottish men's volleyball champions, have
received a European bonus. They will play in the European Champions' Cup
for the second successive season and a new rule to be introduced next
season will guarantee at least two ties in Europe.
If Ragazzi are knocked out in the first round -- no Scottish team has
ever won a European match -- then they would automatically qualify for
the first round of the CEV Cup, volleyball's UEFA Cup.
The Glasgow club begin the countdown to Europe by hosting the City of
Glasgow European Club Champions' Cup at the Kelvin Hall this weekend,
and there are also plans for a pre-season trip to Germany to give the
team as much exposure of the European game as possible.
This weekend, Niliko Masseik, the Belgian champions, top Hungarian
side LRI Malev, the Luxembourg national side and English champions
Mizuno Malory have all accepted invitations.
There is also an inaugural women's event, to be attended by Royal Bank
Scottish Cup winners Rucanor Jets, English Cup winners Sale and English
league champions Malory.
Ragazzi open this weekend's men's tournament with a match against Team
Luxembourg on Friday at 7pm.

OBAN'S Martin Heath is certain to face disciplinary action following
his behaviour in Holland at the European Championships last month, and
he could be dropped from the Scottish team for this year's World
Championships.
The 22-year-old Scottish No.2 upset team manager Pat Nicol by his
actions both on and off court. He won only one match out of four as the
side slumped to a disappointing seventh place, while he also refused to
get out of his bed for a morning match with Switzerland.
Nicol submitted a report to the Scottish Squash executive committee,
which was discussed on Monday evening, and the condemnations require
some action to be taken.
The executive have written to London-based Heath, and will await the
explanation to his side of the story, before making a final decision on
whether he should be banned from the world championships in Egypt in
November.
However, there is little chance of the rift being healed sufficiently
to allow Heath to play while Nicol remains in charge. The manager has
already said he would rather take a team of promising young juniors to
the world championships than players who are unwilling to give 100% for
their country.
Scotland had expected to finish in the medals in Holland, but Nicol
commented: ''The Europeans were a nightmare. We had a realistic chance
of finishing first or second, but our chances were ruined because of one
player.''

PETE Sampras, the defending champion, was jeered off court yesterday
after having slumped to a 6-4, 6-3 first-round defeat against unseeded
Frenchman Fabrice Santoro at the Italian Open in Rome.
The defeat was a further setback for the American, recently troubled
by an ankle injury, as he prepares for the French Open in less than two
weeks.
The crowd whistled and jeered as Sampras overhit a forehand to concede
defeat, the last of 42 unforced errors in an unusually poor performance.
Sampras' exit further weakens a tournament already missing world No.1
Andre Agassi and Boris Becker, who ranks below Sampras at No.3.
But there was more trouble for Becker when Thomas Muster called on the
ATP to take action against the German following comments that could have
been interpreted as suggesting the Austrian took drugs.
The sport's governing body has placed Becker under inquiry for remarks
made after his five-set final defeat by Muster at the recent Monte Carlo
Open.
Becker did not mentioned doping but wondered aloud how Muster had
managed to play five sets after having appeared on the verge of
exhaustion 24 hours earlier.

LIFE has been almost all downhill for Martin Bell since he posted
Britain's best Olympic ski finish seven years ago in Calgary.
This week, citing inadequate funding, he quit. And British Ski
Federation officials yesterday confirmed that the bell may be about to
toll for others in the UK team.
Bell was once referred to as the Richard Gere of skiing by a female
columnist, a man who could ''make mountains move for half the glamourous
groupies of Europe's ski resorts.''
Now the 30-year-old Bell has quit in order to spare his girlfriend,
Lucy, and nine-month old daughter, Imogen, from the type of sacrifice
that is the norm for Britain's cash-strapped skiers.
''Lucy had to go back to work six weeks after Imogen's birth,'' said
Martin yesterday. ''Had to, to support us. I could have had another two
or three years. However that would not be fair. There were times when we
could not pay the mortgage, and fell a couple of months behind.''
Since Britain's Alpine team lost Drambuie's sponsorship in 1992, the
hangover has become acute. ''In 1987-88, we had a downhill team of four
and a back-up team which included a trainer, ski technician, video
camera operator and a physiotherapist,'' says Bell. ''Now we have two
skiers and one trainer -- nobody else.''
Mike Jardine, the BSF chief executive, likens it to sending David
Coulthard to a grand prix with a car and one mechanic with a hammer.
While the Norwegians and Swiss, Austrians, and Italians, travel first
class and live in five-star accommodation, the Brits reduce costs,
travelling overnight by car, eating in the back of vans, sleeping five
to a room, and cooking their own meals.
Bell has got out with his body intact -- well almost. His knee
cartilages are a mess, and his right thumb, once fractured in many
places, was described by the surgeon who repaired it as, ''looking like
bits of muesli.''
Martin says his only regret, after showing such early promise, is not
having fulfilled his potential. ''I tried hard to repeat my early
success, but failed. But I learned more about myself and life in the bad
years.''
He deeply resents the stigma laid on the sport by Eddie the Eagle, who
came last in the Olympic ski jump while Bell was best-placed ski Brit
overall. ''He did UK skiing less harm in Britain than he did abroad,''
insists Martin. ''I beat all the Canadian skiers in Calgary, yet because
of Edwards, it will take decades for British skiers to live him down.
''When I look at some of the material wealth that has come the way of
others, it can be frustrating, but I have no regrets. When you have a
talent you can get sucked along a pathway. People see me as the big
adventurous skier, but I was not adventurous enough to break out of what
was mapped for me.''
Educated at George Watson's in Edinburgh, he obtained six A pass
Highers at the age of 14 -- enough to gain immediate entry to Oxbridge.
But he has no regrets about the missed academic oportunities. ''My brain
is still there. It's not completely lulled to sleep, even though I
forced it to sleep before races like Kitzbuhel. ''If the right
intellectual challenges come along, I'm sure there is life after
skiing.''
He hopes to take up a career in TV -- he presented Meridian's ski
programme last winter, writes for magazines, and would like to become a
general sports presenter.
Jardine explains the sport's crisis, and lays the blame on plummeting
Sports Council grants -- #340,000 before the 1988 Olympics to #120,000.
''Even in 1985 we were receiving #250,000,'' said Jardine, speaking from
the BSF headquarters at East Calder. ''In real terms, with inflation and
stronger foreign currencies what we get now is worth not much more than
#50,000 a year compared with a decade ago.
''We face going backwards for sure. Instead of a professional
administration, we will end up with a voluntary one, and only those who
can afford it will compete.
''Skiing does have an image problem, an element of public perception
that it's a sport for people with private means. The current policies
are in danger of perpetuating that myth.''
Yet there are youngsters from ordinary backgrounds with great
potential, like giant slalom man Alain Baxter, and Lesley McKenna, both
from Aviemore. ''Unless they can find sponsors, or we can find one for
them, then they will not be able to compete,'' adds Jardine.
''Sandra Wilson, from Gasgow, has improved from 350 to 117 in the
world over the past year, and there are three others in the top 100 --
Martin at 77, his brother, Graham, at 42, and Emma Carrick-Anderson at
56.
''We have 11-14 year-olds winning international races, and last year
there were 170 top-three finishes in international events by British
skiers. We have responded to Sports Council requests to improve
efficiency by being professional, organised, and providing support. They
say they want quality coaching, and we have funded that. But we can't
fund our athletes for the 30 weeks a year which they need to spend on
snow.
''We are going to have to cut back the branches of the sport which we
support. The first casualty is likely to be cross-country skiing.''
Last year, the sport lost slalom skier Bill Gaylord, who also quit due
to financial pressures. He was ranked 114 in the world -- Britain's best
ranking in a technical discipline for 12 years. During the past winter,
Richard Cobbing, the world aerials silver medallist, was unable to do
the World Cup campaign, strapped for cash, and the UK had competitors at
only six out of 12 world championships
''It is crazy to make so many cuts when we are doing well -- and it is
unfair. In contrast to having no UK facilities for elite ski training,
Britain has built 900 sports centres and 1500 swimming pools since 1974.
''The UK ski industry turnover is #375m annually . . . more people
watch Ski Sunday than Rugby Special . . .'' Jardine reels off the
statistics of inequality like a well-rehearsed mantra.
And what of the future for Bell's brother, Graham, who has taken over
the mantle of UK No.1? He has a personal sponsorship package with a
travel firm which a has a year to run. After that he will have a
familiar decision to make. It will not be easy. His wife expects their
first child in September.

Ross Finlay finds the beast beneath the beauty
ANY car company which can return to profit, after a spell in the red,
with an annual sales figure of just 1414 vehicles, especially when they
come from two separate marque names and several different model ranges,
is obviously rather special. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is now in such a
trimmed-down but financially healthy position that predictions about
parent company Vickers selling it off look less and less likely to come
true.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are often an interesting
indication of how different national economies are faring. In 1994 North
American, Continental and Middle East sales were down, but Japan was up,
and so was the UK -- by about a quarter over the figure for 1993. In
comparison with other major manufacturers, Rolls-Royce and Bentley
production is tiny in unit numbers, but the entry-level price is
#96,400.
While Rolls-Royce is the world's most valuable brand name, Bentley has
an appeal of its own. Ever since Rolls-Royce bought the original Bentley
Motors in 1931, it has been intriguing to see how the junior partner
marque was regarded by different generations of heads of the senior
firm. Some Bentleys were simply badge-engineered Rolls-Royces, and for a
time the marque seemed almost submerged.
A few years ago it was decided to establish individual Bentley model
ranges which in some instances would have differently tuned versions of
the familiar Rolls-Royce 6.75-litre V8 engine. There were some doubts
about whether export markets would really take to a revitalised Bentley,
considering that one element in its promotion would be the original
company's successes at Le Mans more than 60 years ago. In fact, that has
proved to be no problem, and the ancient sporting heritage still appeals
today.
I have been driving a Bentley Brooklands saloon. Despite the fact that
this is the so-called base model at #96,400, it offers a combination of
lavish materials, technical sophistication, on-road security and
sporting feel which is very difficult to match.
Lesser makes have their luxury sporting saloons too, but the materials
Bentley uses in its passenger cabin are away beyond what any hopeful
rivals offer. Leatherwork is excellent, and when you look at the very
high quality hand-finished walnut trim, you appreciate just how pitiful
by comparison is the ''wood effect'' stuff provided in some other cars.
Again, the finish and depth of the exterior paintwork set industry
standards.
On the move, the Brooklands is just as impressive. This is a bulky,
heavy and very robustly constructed car. But the electronic ride control
adjusts the suspension settings neatly between comfort on the straights
and firmer settings on corners. Computer control of the automatic
transmission adapts the shift pattern as required. And I have never
driven any saloon with such powerful and reassuring anti-lock brakes.
The Brooklands is no slouch for such a sizeable car. It will
accelerate to 60mph in just over nine seconds, has a test track maximum
close to 135mph, and returns around 19mpg at a 75mph cruising gait. Yet
it is simply the entry model for one of the world's most impressive
saloon and convertible series.
At prices all in six figures, Bentley also offers the Turbo R and the
Continental R, saloons with spectacularly enhanced power outputs. Their
0-60mph times drop down closer to six seconds, top speeds are around
150mph, and turbocharger control offers brief over-boost to provide
really strong mid-range acceleration.
Then, at the Geneva Show, the company unveiled the Bentley Azure,
which instantly became the world's most majestic convertible. It has
more than 380bhp on tap, classic looks as a result of design cooperation
between Rolls-Royce and Pininfarina, and a price tag of no less than
#215,000. This is a car which, by its specification and by the response
to it in the motoring press, has shown that Bentley can still hit the
headlines 65 years after its cars last thundered along the Mulsanne
straight to victory at Le Mans.

Robert Powell reports how America has fired a shot across the bows of
the Japanese in their long-running trade dispute
AMERICA moved nearer to an open trade war with Japan yesterday by
unveiling a set of punitive taxes on imports of Japanese luxury cars.
But there are still several weeks for the two countries to patch up
their dispute before these sanctions formally take effect on June 28.
President Bill Clinton hinted as much by saying that the sanctions
would not be applied if an agreement with Japan could be averted
beforehand.
An excellent opportunity for compromise arises next month when Clinton
meets Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at a G7 summit in Canada
between June 15 and 17.
In the meantime, the prospect of America taking affirmative action to
plug its huge trade deficit is acting as a tonic to the depressed
dollar.
Few analysts think that Washington and Tokyo will let their squabble
degenerate into an all-out trade war that could further upset financial
markets across the globe.
Futhermore, Japan's weak coalition government is anxious not to let
the trade dispute tear at the fabric of its close alliance with the
United States on political and security matters.
''There is a good chance that they will try to avoid actual sanctions.
It is not consistent with a free trade philosophy to slap 100% import
tariffs on luxury cars,'' said Tim O'Dell, a strategist with Union Bank
of Switzerland in London.
''I think we are still at the sabre-rattling stage and we would rather
solve this amicably,'' agreed Vinnie Santoro, an independent economist
based in New York.
Washington announced trade sanctions after 20 months of negotiations
with Tokyo failed to produce an agreement on measures to reduce
America's enormous trade deficit with Japan. This came to $60bn last
year and amounted to half the overall US trade deficit.
The trade gap, along with the large US budget deficit, is a major
factor in keeping the dollar weak against the yen and other currencies.
But Washington is also accused of aggravating the dollar's plight by
''talking up the yen'' while the trade talks with Japan were in progress
to keep the dollar weak and boost US exports.
Recently, however, the threat of US sanctions against Japan has caused
a strengthening of the dollar since at last the financial markets see
Washington taking concrete action to cut its trade deficit with Tokyo.
''In some senses, the US sanctions are a public relations exercise,
but it gives them less excuse to talk up the yen,'' said Adam Cole, an
economist with James Capel in London. The dollar was trading around
86.35 yen yesterday, up from a record low of 79.95 in April.
Curiously enough, a last-minute settlement of the trade dispute might
also boost the US currency. ''There would then be no incentive for the
US policy makers to encourage a weak dollar, which is what they have
been perceived as doing for the past two years,'' said Tim O'Dell at
UBS. ''Almost any way ahead is good for the dollar,'' he added.
The sticking point in the trade talks has been Washington's demand
that Japan opens up its domestic market to US exports of cars and car
parts. Hence Washington's decision to target Japanese car exports to the
United States as an opening shot in the sanctions war.
US trade representative Mickey Kantor announced that the United States
would impose a punitive 100% levy on imports of 13 models of Japanese
luxury cars. Japan responded by saying it would appeal to the World
Trade Organisation (WTO), the successor body to the General Agreements
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
But deputy trade minister Yoshihiro Sakamoto said Tokyo was not
planning to announce any counter-sanctions against the United States for
the time being. Some Japanese officials are believed to favour
retaliatory action against US computer exports, which enjoy relatively
high market penetration in Japan.
Juichi Wako, senior economist with Nomura Economic Research in London,
said a solution to the trade dispute hinged on the United States
dropping its demand for Japan to set fixed quotas for imports of US car
parts.
''This suggests some sort of managed trade. It is against the world
trend towards free trade, and that is why the Japanese government is
resisting strongly,'' he said.
Wako suggested a compromise along the lines of an earlier settlement
over trade in computer chips in the 1980s. Japan agreed then to import
20% of all its semi-conductors, but without specifying their country of
origin.
Few economists appear worried that the US-Japan trade dispute could
lead to a spate of protectionist measures by the US and other countries
that would roll back the progress towards free trade achieved in the
Uruguay round of world trade talks that ended last year.
''Most people would see this as an isolated incident, not something
which is going to become standard US policy; it is just the magnitude of
the bilateral imbalance between Japan and the US,'' said Adam Cole.
If the US sanctions unveiled yesterday are imposed and America and
Japan lock horns in a trade war, the immediate effects on Britain would
be negligible.
''I suppose you would expect UK exports to be marginal
beneficiaries,'' said Cole, adding that companies such as Jaguar might
pick up a few extra orders. But he warned that the impact of US
sanctions against Japanese luxury car imports would take six to 12
months to filter through.

To make rail franchises work, profits will have to come from higher
subsidies -- precisely the opposite of what privatisation was to be
about, says Roger Ford
WITH the Government's new rail fare policy pegging increases in ticket
prices to the retail price index, firms considering bidding for
passenger rail franchises have seen control of yet another part of the
business taken out of their hands.
Before this latest development, the Government had already strapped
train operators into a straitjacket of contracts fixing about 70% of
their costs. Services to be run have been closely specified. Now the
Government intends to control income as well.
Firms interested in railway privatisation are now realising that what
is on offer is not the chance to run a business and make money, but a
contract to manage a tightly controlled state business for seven years.
And the success of this business will depend critically on continuing
government subsidy.
In the case of ScotRail, the current budget looks like this:
* EXPENDITURE: Cost of track access: #160m a year -- fixed for six
years but falling by 2% per year from 1996. Operating costs: #70m a year
* INCOME: Fares: #90m -- now largely capped for seven years.
* SUBSIDY: #185m.
For a private business looking at the franchise to run ScotRail over
the next seven years, the key questions are how much profit do we need
to make, and where does it come from?
Just how much profit a private company will need to make depends on
the financial risk. The good news is that a franchise has no assets to
buy, and the bulk of the money to be raised will be in the form of a
bank bond to protect the interests of passengers who have paid in
advance for season tickets should the company go broke.
But the bad news is that at the end of the franchise there is nothing
to sell. In the case of a management buyout, this is crucial, because at
the end of the franchise you could lose your job, with nothing to show
for seven years hard work.
If the management of a factory buys the business, they have the
opportunity to earn a living while making it grow, and then sell their
shares or float the company on the stock market. In either case, the
management and workforce who have risked their funds and jobs in the
buyout reap the reward. But in a rail franchise, the only way to make
money will be by taking out profit during the life of the franchise.
In a normal business this profit can come in two ways -- cutting costs
and increasing earnings. But this will be difficult for a rail
franchise. ScotRail, for example, controls only 25% of its costs and 33%
of its income.
British Rail has been under heavy pressure to cut costs for over a
decade. But Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mahwinney reckons past
privatisations have shown that the efficiency savings from the
introduction of private sector management have always been
underestimated, and BR will be no exception.
But if ScotRail could cut the costs under its control by 10% the
saving would be only #7m a year. Achieving these savings could be costly
because, on franchising, the jobs involved would be protected by
European regulations and have to be bought out.
By far the largest cost for the train operators is track access
charges, and Railtrack has been instructed by the Rail Regulator to cut
its charges by 2% a year starting in 1996. In the case of ScotRail, this
will produce #65m over the next six years -- say #11m a year; but this
is before inflation.
How much service improvements and better marketing could drive up
fares income is debatable. In capping fares in line with the retail
price index, when BR has raised its prices by 22% over inflation over
the past decade, the Government is banking on lower fares bringing in
more passengers, thereby reducing the need for subsidy.
Railway pricing experts reckon that a #1 fare cut brings in only 60p
of extra revenue, unless there are other dramatic changes such as more
frequent trains or shorter journey times. On ScotRail's most highly
subsidised lines the railway is a social service, and even halving fares
would not induce more people to travel, because the population simply
isn't there.
But even if new management was able to earn an extra 10% in fares
income from the existing railway, that is only another #9m a year,
compared with ScotRail's subsidy of #185m a year.
All these efficiency savings and improved earnings will take time to
come through, but on my highly optimistic assumptions, ScotRail could
theoretically be making a profit of around #30m a year by the end of a
seven-year franchise. But will this be enough?
Any firm taking on the ScotRail franchise will be signing itself up to
a long-term contract for track access and train leasing costing over
#200m a year, but with a farebox income less than half this sum.
If the economy turns down, or if Strathclyde PTE has to reduce its
support, these bills will still have to be paid. So a prudent operator
will have to build up reserves rapidly, and the only way of doing that
in the early years of a franchise is through increased subsidy.
And how secure is the subsidy? Franchising director Roger Salmon has
already told the Parliamentary Select Committee on Transport that if, at
some time in the future, the funding he received from the Department of
Transport was insufficient to meet all the demands for subsidy, he would
have to renegotiate service levels.
And this could happen. With every train operator needing subsidy and
the franchising director promising that he will increase subsidies to
make franchises attractive to private bidders, the Treasury is going to
have to increase rail subsidies.
I estimate that to make rail franchises attractive to the private
sector, subsidies will have to increase nationally by around 15%. This
means the Treasury will have to find another #300m to fund the railways.
As the original aim of privatisation was to cut the cost of the rail
network, this will not go down well in London. When the inevitable
cutbacks come, the most vulnerable franchises will be those with the
biggest subsidies.
Even a 5% cut n ScotRail's Government funding would wipe out either
the 10% efficiency gains or the 10% increase in revenue -- and these
figures are optimistic. The operators of the privately run railway will
be more dependent on subsidy than ever before.

THE thriving architectural salvage businesses up and down the country
illustrate how highly prized the work of craftsmen has become. But there
is no need to pay the earth for fine workmanship -- skilled
cabinetmakers can restore original pieces of furniture and the interiors
of Victorian homes at a reasonable cost.
The restoration of homes built at the turn of the century, and of the
furniture which looks best in them, has fallen to a growing group of
skilled craftsmen and cabinetmakers, able to restore and re-create the
internal joinery, stained glass and metal work which formed part of the
interior decor of homes built before the First World War.
In recent years, building society statistics have shown that more
first-time buyers sought mortgages for pre-1919 properties than for
post-war or inter-war houses combined. The appeal of these types of
homes are largely due to their architecture and interior decoration. As
the number of buyers of older properties has increased, and renovation
and restoration has got under way at a steady rate, so the number of
skilled specialists has grown to meet the demand.
The best specialist companies combine the craft skills of
cabinetmaking and repair with a knowledge of the history of styles of
interior decor, and eye for the enhancing effects of time and wear. For
example, woodcarving in restoration work requires a quite different
technique from that used by the skilled woodcarver. The reason is that
each woodcarver develops his own style, and this is his downfall as a
restorer. The interior or furniture restorer who is basically a
cabinetmaker will copy exactly what he can see, cut for cut, imitating
every motif precisely, and matching his carver's tools to the curves and
angles of the original carving. In the finished work there will be
nothing of his own style, and therefore his replacement pieces will be
much more in harmony with the original.
Good cabinetmakers and restorers also thoroughly understand wood. Even
after a few hundred years, movement still goes on in all woods, and this
must be taken into account. For instance, big cracks can suddenly
develop in pieces of eighteenth or nineteenth century furniture, or in
staircases of wood panelling brought into a centrally heated home. This
will happen if the furniture or carved interior stairs or panels were
previously in conditions where the wood could expand during the cool of
the night and contract during the rise of temperature in the daytime. In
a sense, the wood was breathing.
In a centrally heated home it will be subjected to constant heat, so
it will contract and continue to shrink, the measurement across the
grain becoming less and less and the board getting narrower all the
time. This shrinkage will go on until the breaking point is reached, and
the piece will eventually split at its weakest point, or twist, warp and
crack. Humidifiers can counteract this process, and in some
circumstances bowls of flowers and indoor plants can help prevent dry
conditions.
The enthusiasm for preserving and restoring furniture and interior
woodwork orginally created at the turn of the century is related to the
quality of the timber as well as the good design and rich decoration.
Another interesting characteristic of wood is that the depth of colour
increases with age, and this is a factor which a skilled cabinetmaker
will take into account when selecting wood for furniture or interior
decor, or when matching wood for repair work. A common treatment of
woodwork in Victorian interiors was graining. Through this process,
essentially cheap timber was made to look like more expensive wood by
applying patterns to its surface in imitation of the rarer timber's
grain.
Water-based paints were used for graining in the imitation of soft
woods like pine and fir, and the grainer began his work only after the
painter had given the new wood three or four coats of plain paint. His
first job was to lay on the graining ground, which was chosen to be as
close as possible in colour to the wood to be imitated. On top of this
ground, a further coat of paint matched to the tone of the desired
timber was applied and the grain of the wood reproduced by drawing steel
combs of different sizes across the wet surface.
When the desired effect had been achieved, the finish was sponged down
with a mixture of beer and whitening before overgraining with a thin
coat of complementary colour, and the finishing coats of varnish
applied.
Modern restoration crafstmen can reproduce these effects using modern
materials. But care should be taken when restoration work is under way
-- Victorian paints almost invariably relied on lead compounds to
provide the colour or accelerate the drying of the paint.
The adhesion of these paints to woodwork compares very favourably with
the performance of modern paints but lead compounds can be injurious to
health, and are excluded from modern paints for that reason. Ensure that
children do not come into contact with old, flaking paintwork in the
original features of your Victorian house, for fingers contaminated with
these old paints can lead to fatal lead poisoning.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle is expected to announce tomorrow morning that it
is buying Courage for around #450m from Foster's Brewing Group of
Australia. That will turn the Edinburgh-based company into Britain's
largest brewer with a market share of about 31%.
It is probable that it will be accompanied by a rights issue which may
raise around #325m.
The way was cleared after the Office of Fair Trading decided not to
ask for a full-scale investigation into the prices that the brewers
charge their pub tenants as opposed to those at which they sell beer
into the free trade.
The OFT yielded to pressure from the European Commission in February
which was concerned that pub tenants of Inntrepreneur Estates, which is
a major pub company owned jointly by Grand Metropolitan and brewers
Courage, were being forced to buy beer from Courage at full list price.
In contrast, free trade buyers were able to get a discount of up to #100
on a barrel listed at perhaps #250, equivalent to about 35p per pint.
However, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of Fair Trading, has
concluded that the tenanted or tied pubs are not being put at a
significant disadvantage and so the matter is not being referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
But he is concerned that particular tied tenants have found their
lease obligations difficult to meet and he is calling on the brewers and
other landlords to ensure that tenants are fully aware of the financial
obligations before taking on pub leases.

THE Government was no doubt hoping the furore over the sale last March
of its last tranche of shares in the two English electricity generators
would fade away in time despite the anger it generated in the investment
community.
But it may come back to haunt it as National Power, the larger of the
two, is seriously considering suing the Government over the debacle,
where the shares dropped sharply after the industry regulator said it
was reviewing the electricity pricing regime.
This emerged yesterday as the group revealed another strong trading
performance, with profits for the year to March up 16% at #735m before
exceptionals, on the day the Labour Party was setting out its plans for
regulating the utilities, which involve sharing ''excess'' profits with
customers.
There was a sceptical response from the City, which wondered what
would constitute excessive, particularly as utilities could use creative
accounting to reduce headline figures. There was relief that ideas for a
windfall tax had been dropped.
Once again National Power shareholders do well, with a final dividend
of 11.1p making a total 24% ahead at 15.45p, and there is the prospect
of a capital repayment in future.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the power regulator, stunned virtually
everyone when he said the day after the Government raised #4000m from
the share sale that he was going to review price controls. That sent
share prices of the whole sector plunging. The generators are not
affected by the review as they are not subject to price controls but
their shares dropped all the same to below the offer price.
National Power itself was directly affected by the share price
reaction because it had agreed to buy some of the Government's shares
for cancellation. It paid 460p per share, a total of #453m, whereas
after Professor Littlechild's announcement they dropped to 430p. Had the
deal been done at this price the company would have saved #30m.
John Baker, National Power chairman, said the company was seeking
legal advice to establish what loss, if any, shareholders had suffered,
whether they would have a legal case and what it might comprise. The
share price has recovered so it will be an interesting argument. He
suggested that had National Power known that the regulator was even
contemplating a review, announced just seven months after a new regime
had been instituted, the company would have put it in the prospectus.
While National Power has fallen out with the Government over this
question it appears relatively unfazed over Labour's plans. Mr Baker
said he had no quarrel with the principle that ''excess'' profits should
be divided between customers and shareholders. The problem would come in
how excess is defined and whether a Labour Government would interfere in
other ways.
For the moment it is the regulator which worries National Power more
and certainly Professor Littlechild's bombshell in March showed the
electricity companies that the regime can be changed at any time, which
is hardly conducive to forward planning. Mr Baker considers there needs
to be more accountability, transparency, and broader advice available to
the regulator.
The immediate problem is divesting the 4000MW of capacity, equivalent
to two power stations and a fifth of the group's total capacity, which
the regulator is insisting upon. Talks are under way with possible
purchasers but there is little real interest and the group is
considering demerging the capacity into a separate company despite the
complications this would entail.
If it still has the plant by the end of the year the regulator may
refer the company to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This does
not worry Mr Baker because he is confident it can put a good case
forward.
National Power's market share has slipped from 35% to 34% as a result
of new entrants and strong performance from Nuclear Electric. This will
continue, not least with the completion of the interconnector from
Scotland to England. Mr Baker did not like the prospect of the Scots
''marching over the Border'' into his market but there was nothing he
could do about it.
National Power sees its market share stabilising at about 30%
eventually. While this process goes on, shareholders will still receive
dividend increases well ahead of inflation as dividend cover is being
steadily reduced from 2.8 to the target of 2.5p. Gearing has fallen from
13% to just 9%, which is considered far too low. Finance director Brian
Birkenhead sees 30% as a normal level and this may be achieved through
share buy-backs or capital repayments direct to shareholders, probably
the latter.
Productivity gains of 24% drove profits forward, though there is no
further major job reduction programme in hand after the 1000 job losses
which have occurred last year, bringing employee numbers down to 5000.
Power station overheads and running costs were reduced by 16% and there
was a 7% reduction in fuel cost per unit of production as more output
came from fuel-efficient combined cycle gas turbine stations.
International operations are coming along, particularly the 25%-owned
Hub project in Pakistan where power will start to be produced next year.
This gives National Power a good start in the country which will require
many more plants. It is also involved in power stations in India and
China.
National Power shares edged up 1p to 466p where they yield 4.1%.
Progress will be more difficult against the background of regulatory
uncertainty and the absence of further major productivity gains. But at
least the possibility of a Labour Government should cause less worry.

THE Glasgow-based cheese distributor A McLelland &amp; Son has won a court
action against Scottish Pride over the right to use the Galloway Cheese
brand name.
McLelland took legal action in the Court of Session last year after
cheese manufacturers Scottish Pride -- formerly part of the Scottish
Milk Marketing Board -- said that it should no longer distribute cheese
under the Galloway brand name or use the distinctive Galloway logo which
included the Saltire flag and a red strip bearing the Galloway name.
Scottish Pride claimed the Galloway brand as its own but McLelland saw
it as its creation, devised to assist in the marketing of cheese to
stores and supermarkets all over Scotland.
Since November last year Scottish Pride has been prevented, under the
terms of an interim interdict, from using the Galloway name.
In a 169-page judgment issued yesterday, Lord Penrose took the view
that while Scottish Pride was the manufacturer of cheese sold under the
Galloway label any distinctiveness relating to the brand could only have
been generated by McLelland's marketing techniques.
Retail traders would be aware that Scottish Pride was the source of
the cheese and McLelland took pains to introduce its customers to the
Scottish Pride creameries and staff. Traders would also know that the
same goods were available directly from Scottish Pride itself.
''The selection of Galloway as against Scottish Pride, in such
circumstances, could relate only to the marketing activity of McLelland
and its reputation in the market,'' said Lord Penrose.
The single question to be decided in the case was who was responsible
for the presentation and marketing of the Galloway name so that it
generated goodwill as an asset, he added.
''I have come to be clearly of the view that McLelland is entitled to
the benefit of that goodwill.''
Lord Penrose said that the brand name had been conceived by McLelland
for its own exclusive use. Scottish Pride had agreed to package cheddar
using that name for McLelland alone and that cheese was marketed
exclusively by McLelland in competition with Scottish Pride and
supermarket own-brand labels.
A spokesman for Scottish Pride said that it was disappointed with the
judgment -- but only as a matter of principle rather than for any
commercial effect on its cheese-making and selling operations.
''The matter of principle involved our board's strong belief that the
ownership of the Galloway brand was vested in the shareholders of
Scottish Pride as inheritors of the production arm of the former
Scottish Milk Marketing Board, he said.
The company took a positive view of its future cheese sales and
already had plans to market its own mature cheddar under the
''better-known'' Scottish Pride brand name.
For McLelland's Mr Hugh Mclelland Irvine, chairman, said that having
introduced the Galloway Cheese brand 35 years ago they were determined
to protect it.
* EARLIER this year a consortium led by McLelland acquired the
Galloway Creamery in Stranraer, rescuing it from receivership. It is now
re-establishing itself as a cheese-manufacturing unit with a target of
10,000 tonnes for its first year of operation. Yesterday's court
decision is seen as giving that plant further security.

SADDLED with gearing of 20% the #1100m Edinburgh Investment Trust,
which is managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, underperformed stock markets
in its year to March 31, but it has staged a good recovery since then.
Net asset value fell by 6.5% to 319.9p and the shares lost 4.6% to
292[1/2]p, compared with a drop of 1.5% in the benchmark All-Share
index, but this was offset in part by an inflation-beating increase in
dividends.
Earnings per share increased by 2% to 10.37p, helped by special
one-off payments from Great Universal Stores and Yorkshire Electricity.
The previous year's earnings benefited from enhanced scrip dividends
which were not generally repeated. A reduction in the trust's gilt
portfolio masked the strong growth in dividends generated by equity
investments.
A planned final dividend of 6.3p will increase the total for the year
by 6.9% to 9.35p. Dunedin made the point that the dividend is well
covered by earnings. After transferring the surplus, revenue reserves
stand at 8.33p a share, equal to nearly 90% of the total dividend.
The equity portfolio is invested in companies able to provide dividend
growth rather than high income. Dunedin is confident that Edinburgh is
well placed to continue its progressive dividend policy.
Despite the setback on the capital front, the trust's share register
has continued to expand to over 41,000, more than 7000 ahead of 1994.
PEP investors account for 6800.
Edinburgh's manager Ian Massie said: ''International equities were
affected badly by the rise in US interest rates and in many countries
sharp falls in share prices were experienced.''
He added that net asset value was dragged down by poor returns from
overseas holdings, particularly in South America and the Pacific.
''The rises in interest rates and the adverse impact on markets were
greater than had been forecast, and as a result the borrowings had a
negative effect on the performance of the company's net assets.''
Following sales of #36m of gilts and and net sales of equities of #8m
borrowings were reduced by #50m to #155m, taking the gearing down from
20.4% to 16.6%.
The decision to maintain gearing at a high level has so far paid off
in the current financial year. Net asset value has gained 5.6% to
337.8p.
Equity exposure to the Continent and the US was reduced and the
proceeds reinvested in the UK and emerging markets. The #985m equity
portfolio is split 92.2% in the UK, 1.5% US, 3.3% Japan, 2% emerging
markets, and 1% Pacific.
In January, Edinburgh changed its investment trust classification from
international general to UK general. Even this would give it the
flexibility to invest up to 20% of its assets overseas. At the end of
the financial year 97% of net assets were invested in UK equities.
Dunedin said: ''After a long period of consolidation, the favourable
outlook for UK equities is being recognised gradually by investors and
better returns are anticipated in 1995 and 1996. These prospects are
reflected in the company's on-going use of borrowings.
''The current environment of strong economic growth with low inflation
is generating high-quality profits for UK companies. Growth in profits
is reflected in dividends which have been ahead of expectations in the
last year and these trends are likely to continue.
''This attractive outlook is not reflected fully in share values in
the UK and equities are expected to make further progress in the months
ahead.''

THE television sector was thrown into turmoil yesterday after Pearson
said that it had sold its 14.8% effective stake in Yorkshire Tyne Tees
to MAI for a total of #41.2m.
The move was seen as a sign that Pearson is confident its 20%-owned
consortium will win the Channel 5 Licence. Lord Hollick's MAI is also a
member of the same consortium.
Greg Dyke, chairman of Pearson Television, a subsidiary of the media
empire best known as publisher of the Financial Times, commented on the
YTTV disposal: ''We have decided that a 14% stake in a regional
broadcaster is no longer of any strategic interest to us.''
The move immediately sparked off hopes of a bid battle with Granada,
which owns 14.3% of YTTV. Manchester-based Granada is excellently placed
geographically to expand into Yorkshire.
MAI bought Anglia year with the accompanying furore over the share
purchases by Lord Archer's friend, Kurdish businessman Broosk Saib, just
before the MAI bid for Anglia was announced and when Lady Archer was a
director of Anglia. It also has a 60% stake in south of England
contractor Meridian.
YTTV shares jumped 22p to 539p compared with the 500p at which the
Pearson deal was transacted.
Also caught up in the action was Scottish TV, up 14p to 481p, on
speculation that Mirror Group will increase its holding from 19.9% to
29.9% as a prelude to the expected relaxation in cross-media ownership.
The existing stake was acquired at 520p.

HANSON continues to keep journalists and the City guessing about the
timing and nature of its next acquisition. It has made no secret of its
readiness to make another large purchase on the scale of Quantum
Chemical.
However, chief executive Derek Bonham yesterday said that he feels
under no pressure to make an acquisition and will only act when he sees
the right opportunity tht creates value for shareholders.
Although there is a case to be made for a friendly merger, Mr Bonham
said that a hostile bid meant that you were not a hostage to fortune and
could effectively start running the newly acquired business from a clean
sheet of paper.
There is little doubt that Hanson has the financial and managerial
resources to handle another big deal. Following its demerger of US
Industries, for which it received shareholder approval at a meeting this
week, it will be 37% geared. Several possible bid candidates have been
mooted including the Safeway supermarket chain, United Biscuits,
Yorkshire Electricity, and most recently, British Gas.
However, there is more than enough to do in the existing business
which performed very strongly in the first half of the year helped by
particularly strong trading at Quantum Chemicals. Group profits before
tax and exceptionals jumped to #633m compared with #351m previously,
ahead of City expectations. Improving economies on both sides of the
Atlantic and continuing efficiency drives enabled margins to improve
across a range of the group's businesses.
Quantum, the largest US producer of polyethylene with 15% market
share, benefited from the sharp rises seen in a range of chemical prices
because of capacity shortages and increased world demand. Its position
as the leading US polyethylene producer enabled it to boost its margins
substantially. Its profits at #213m were almost seven times higher than
in 1994. The Peabody coal mining business was hit by mild winter weather
but even so recovered well from the effects of last year's strike.
Among the UK businesses, Imperial Tobacco performed well, increasing
its share in a market that dropped 4% because of increases in duty.
Imperial reported record profits. The company benefited from trade
buying prior to last November's Budget and strong growth in Continental
European sales, particularly in France. Although trade stocks are still
current underlying profits are still strong. A big push is being made
into the Far East with deals in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
The ARC aggregates business also performed well with margins up
although overall volumes remained flat. Further price increases should
benefit margins in the second half. Hanson expressed its disappointment
at the proposed cut-backs in the Government's roadbuilding programme
which it said were ''unwelcome and short-sighted''.
Elsewhere, Hanson Brick also benefited from better margins despite the
slowdown in the housing market. Hanson Electrical performed well helped
by a contribution from last year's Scholes acquisition. Seven Seas
continues to lead the growing UK market for vitamins and mineral
supplements. The recently acquired Haliborange brand performed well.
Although chemical prices have shown signs of stabilising at their
current levels Hanson is optimistic about its prospects in the second
half. Cashflow should be higher than the #175m seen in the first six
months which augurs well for the dividend. It is being maintained at 3p
at the interim stage pending a review at the full year when the USI
demerger should be completed.
Hanson shares have underperformed the market by about 7% in the past
year and yesterday they slipped a further 2[3/4]p to 248[1/4]p on
disappointment with the dividend.
The stock is on a high yield and low price earnings multiple.
Investors are implicitly sceptical about the dividend prospects and the
quality of the earnings. Analysts at brokers Smith New Court believe
that UK fund managers are unlikely to want to hold the demerged USI
stock.
This factor may encourage existing shareholders who do not want the
headache of owning a US quoted stock in a UK portfolio to sell ahead of
the demerger. However, the improving news on trading within its
businesses and healthy outlook prompts Smith New Court to recommend
buying the shares. It notes that Mr Bonham bought #646,000 of stock
through options in April.

ECONOMIC recovery is powering BOC's core gases business ahead, helping
the group to report profits up 12% to #239m before exceptionals for the
six months to March.
Gases were 12% at #180m at the trading level, with a particularly
strong showing in the US, where many new orders have been secured. BOC
says that when these are completed they will double its tonnage in the
US.
Volume continued to increase in the UK and some price increases have
been secured.
The vacuum technology division is trading very strongly, on the back
of a rising order intake. Its profits rose 27% to #31.4m. Demand from
semi-conductor manufacturers is strong and new products are meeting with
success, BOC claims. The distribution businesss for Marks &amp; Spencer is
doing well.
The anaesthetics operation had profits up 5% at #31.3m on the back of
better margins, though sales were down owing to a disposal.
BOC commented: ''Economic recovery was sustained in most major markets
and demand remained generally buoyant. Industrial production was
particularly active in the US, but remained subdued in Japan. The pace
of economic growth slowed a little in Australia but accelerated in South
Africa.''
''Some sectors of the UK economy such as construction and fabrication
are still slow.''
BOC's restructuring programme is on track and achieving the cost
reductions expected. A second interim dividend of 12.4p is declared.

STERLING moved lower with the dollar. City analysts will closely
analyse today's unemployment and average earnings for signs of a
slowdown in economic growth.
The minutes for the April meeting of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and
Bank of England Governor Eddie George are also published today and will
be scrutinued for signs of any disagreement over the future direction of
interest rates.
Ahead of the data, sterling was quoted at DM2.2519, a drop of more
than a pfennig. However, it rose against a weak dollar by a
fifth-of-a-cent to $1.5683. Sterling's trade-weighted index gained 0.3
to 84.4.
The dollar extended its losses as the US/Japan trade dispute

<RECORDNO>978354348</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Washington, Tuesday -- Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan today
called for a stronger attack on the federal budget deficit, warning that
the United States cannot count on foreign money indefinitely to finance
its economy.
''It is essential that the momentum toward reducing, and eventually
eliminating, the deficit be accelerated,'' the central bank chairman
said.
In a speech for delivery to the National Association of Realtors, he
also stressed the importance of price stability for the long-term health
of the US economy, calling that a ''key ingredient'' to improved living
standards.
But he steered clear of commenting directly on recent signs of
stronger inflation and slower economic growth and gave little, if any,
hint about the future direction of interest rates.
''It is not a goal of monetary policy to encourage fluctuations in
interest rates,'' Mr Greenspan said. ''We at the Federal Reserve are
striving to provide a stable platform for businesses generally . . . to
encourage the greatest possible sustained advance in economic activity
over time.''
Still, he said the central bank must be ready to adapt its monetary
policy to the ''rapidly-evolving'' forces that affect the economy so as
to avoid damaging economic boom and bust.
The Fed chairman told the Realtors that he was encouraged by the
increased efforts of the past few years to cut the $200bn annual federal
budget deficit.
But he made clear that more needed to be done, in comments that
amounted to an implicit endorsement of Republican lawmakers' efforts to
eliminate the deficit by 2002.
The Clinton administration has opposed the Republican drive to end
government red ink over the next seven years, arguing that the
hard-fisted approach poses risks for the economy.
''The simple fact remains that budget deficits are damaging because
they drain our pool of savings,'' Mr Greenspan said.
The dollar's weakness earlier this year may have represented a warning
from world markets that US savings are too low, he added.
He said the Fed wants to dampen the ups and downs of the economy and
avoid damaging boom-bust cycles. ''The Federal Reserve has no magical
power to eliminate economic fluctuations,'' he said. ''But we endeavour
to minimise them, and in doing so, seek to improve the environment for
long-term economic growth.''
The Fed chairman said the central bank began raising interest rates
last year to try to ''forestall an intensification of inflation
pressures that ultimately would threaten the expansion''. -- Reuter.

build a Hong Kong-Beijing fibre-optic-cable link.
The company, 57.5% owned by Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, announced last
year it was willing to invest $HK2000m (#170m) in the fibre-optic link.
Officials were reluctant to discuss details of the project and would
not outline any investment plans on grounds that they were confidential.
But chief executive Linus Cheung said: ''We can assure our minority
shareholders that the deal is a good deal. ''We are not at liberty to

James McKillop reports on how a 'green' argument for a fifth terminal
at Heathrow has left the opposition seeing red
HIGH-FLYING legal teams are hovering around Heathrow for what, for
them, is likely to develop into the country's most lucrative dogfight.
It is a task that would press even the most silken-tongued English QC.
They are being asked to persuade a panel that it will not only be in the
interest of the nation that a fifth terminal is constructed at Heathrow
-- but that it will not add to local environmental problems.
It is an argument that has been put to the people who live in and
around the area, and one they have already rejected. They live with the
noise. They know aural pollution when they hear it. They have had
enough.
Out of the 10,000 locals who have expressed a view, 9000 are against.
This in itself might suggest the odds could be tilted in their favour.
Even the most persuasive barrister might think now was the time to give
up. Not at all.
Those who want to see Heathrow continue to flourish and develop beyond
the monster it already is are convinced that they will win the day and
will do so under the environment cause.
A lot of brass can be made from advocacy, but surely it must take more
than a lot of brass neck to press the case for this development on green
issues.
The contradiction is not causing embarrassment to those pushing the
case at the inquiry which began yesterday at a hotel near the airport.
It is likely to last two years.
It soon became clear that conservation would be a main thrust by the
legal representatives of the major players in the air industry who are
determined to ensure Heathrow remains Europe's premier gateway. British
Airways were at the forefront in pressing the case.
At the same time some would say it was shrewd of the British Airports
Authority -- the company that stands to win most -- that they had
recruited Des Wilson, former Friends of the Earth spokesman, former
director of Shelter, and one-time ''brains'' in a couple of Liberal
General Election campaigns, as their #120,000-a-year director of
corporate and public affairs.
His conversion may have surprised many. Some of those against the
proposed development said they were not surprised. Nevertheless last
night there was general recognition that the conservation approach now
taken by the proposed developers bore his hallmark.
''Dear Neighbour,'' began a letter signed by Sir John Egan, chief
executive of BAA, to those living around Heathrow. It was a billet-doux
intended to rubbish all the claims made by the do-gooders of the kind
Wilson at one time used to represent.
No, despite the increased demand for air travel, there would not be a
consequential increase in air-traffic noise -- even though the new
terminal would increase the 50,000-passenger capacity at Heathrow by a
further 30,000.
It was suggested that by the time the terminal would come into
operation there would be aircraft with quieter engines and capable of
carrying more passengers.
No, there was no danger of a massive increase in flights in and out of
the airport, and there would certainly be no more night flights.
It would not call for a third runway at the airport. Neither would it
lead to a 14-lane M25 nor any greater congestion of the M3 and other
roads around Heathrow.
The do-gooders, who at one time used to flock around the feet of
Wilson, insisted you could trust none of this. After all, they pointed
out, it was only 10 years ago that BAA was saying that there would be no
requirement for a fifth terminal.
''They got their fourth terminal and now, hardly surprisingly, they
are after their fifth,'' I was told. ''They say they don't want a third
runway, but can you believe that? We don't.''
Former colleagues of Wilson said: ''Of course it is a nonsense to
suggest that you can build a new terminal at Heathrow to cope with the
numbers they are talking about and that it will not lead to an increase
of traffic on the roads.
''It would take an extraordinary change of attitude on transport
policy by this or any other government to prevent it.''
British Airways chairman Sir Colin Marshall, strangely enough, saw it
in black and white terms. After all, his company would run the fifth
terminal.
''A new terminal is not desirable, it is essential,'' he declared.
''Heathrow is unable to cope with the growth of the air-travel market
which is running now and for the foreseeable future.''
Heathrow, he said, was Europe's premier gateway and that would be
given up to expanding European competitor airports if the development
did not go ahead. ''By the year 2010 without the fifth terminal, there
would be 26 million fewer passengers at London airports.''
If the project did not go ahead 7000 jobs would be lost, British
Airways said. The UK would lose its leading role in the aviation
industry and up to #1000m a year in tourism that might be expected to
come to this country would go elsewhere.
''All of that is balderdash,'' said those who are opposed to the
development.  ''All these arguments will be put to the test during the
next two years of this inquiry. The truth is that there are those out to
make a killing from this proposal at the expense of those who have to
put up with pollution.
''Those who live in this area of London will sooner or later discover
it has been turned into an airport slum.''

Eschewing the fat: Anvar Khan talks to American research scientist Dr
Karen Burke whose mission is the erosion of cellulite that gets under
your skin.
SHE had a starter for a main course; smoked salmon and granary bread,
mineral water, and a green salad. She wore a red hunting suit with a
short skirt and gold buttons. A languorous pair of long Barbie doll
legs, in black patent stilettos, in not so much fishnet as whale bait,
crossed at the knee under the lunch table like scaffolding.
Her scarf was arranged in the Nancy Reagan style; softly pleated up to
the neck, with a brooch which portrayed a Botticelli nude. It seemed to
be involved in repeating one of the Thin Thighs For Life exercise poses
recommended in the doctor's book, for the author, Karen Burke MD, is an
American research scientist who practises dermatologic surgery, and her
main concern is the erosion of cellulite.
''Cellulite is a layer of lump, dumpy, fat under the skin. Female fat
is packaged differently in long, thin bags. If the fat cells become
larger the bags bulge. An average woman is 22% fat and the average man
about 15% fat. And the fat is distributed more on our hips. We are set
up to have fat on our hips,'' she says, chewing momentarily on the
conspiracy between God and Mother Nature, that childbearing would exact
its privilege as a toll.
Burke has a PhD in biophysics, and studies methods to prevent and
treat skin cancer. She writes a regular health column in the Diplomatic
World Bulletin from fertility to depression to Aids. But it's the
superficial, not the deep, that she's concerned with. ''I am a doctor
because I really want to help people. I am known for making people look
better by reversing the effects of ageing. I help take away wrinkles.''
By the breadth of her work, Burke is a superpower who has exploited
her knowledge of skin and its response to various stimuli, and come up
with a range of skin-care products which she wants to introduce in
Britain. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be a body as well as a
mind. The two have been split into opposing factions for too long, in
the belief that face creams and plastic surgery belong to bimbo culture,
and that intellect belongs to feminism.
''There's no doubt that someone feels better about themselves if they
are healthy,'' explains Burke. She then turns to face me head on.
''You're going to look the same way in two years' time except that every
hair on your head will be different and every cell on your face will be
new. Apart from your brain cells, your skin changes entirely every 30
days.''
The degenerating process hurts, spiritually, not physically. Anyone
who prides herself on consistency of character doesn't like being
undercut by infinity, the sneakiness of time. But Burke believes, like
Napoleon, that it's the smaller battles which win the war. If cellulite
can be conquered, this is one step forward to controlling woman's
physical destiny.
There is room, however, in Burke's handbag, for psychological make-up,
for a degree of philosophy. Like her close friend of 17 years -- Andy
Warhol -- Burke is skilled at presenting and clarifying the image. Like
him, she is not a cultural force, more a skilled interpreter of the
spirit of the times.
''I met Andy Warhol at a party and we talked in a corner, and became
friends. He was a very intelligent, kind man who would do anything for
his friends. He read everything, newspapers, magazines, books. He had a
strong image, which was his statement to the world, his own PR.
''He was very health-conscious and ate nothing but vegetables. He
didn't smoke or drink. He was way ahead of his time, especially when he
made the prediction that everybody would become famous for 15 minutes.
Look at the programmes on cable TV. He was a visionary. He never did my
portrait, but he always asked, and I said, 'Oh, no, wait until next
year, I'll look better then'.''
This is the meat of Burke's work. In her cosmetics and in her
dermatological practice, she courts the desire for self-improvement.
''I've been on every diet, I've eaten nothing but carrots for two
weeks. I used to be overweight at various times in my life. I'm more
relaxed now. I love to swim and do 20 minutes a day. Everywhere I can
walk, I walk. There are so many places here in Scotland. We went to
Aberfeldy. It was wonderful. Robert Burns wrote a poem there, and
there's the little bench he sat on when he wrote, and I sat there . .
.'' she impersonates someone in awe of the sky.
''You can't possibly reduce your thighs by rubbing a cream on. But
used in conjunction with a weight-loss programme, it helps. If you add
caffeine to the cells in the lab, it inhibits the fat moving and helps
the fat in the cells break down so that it moves out. The question is,
if you rub caffeine on your thighs, does any of it get in? That's very
difficult to measure.'' It's also very difficult, personally, to get
excited about.
She laughs as she probably cries. Jutting, throaty emissions of Ahuh,
huh, huh, huh, huh. Burke confesses to being in her ''mid-forties'', and
says that she doesn't talk about her age or her husband. But he's a
businessman, she's been married a year and a half and there's no kids.
''I've always worked so hard.'' She also confesses to not knowing who
Britt Ekland is, which suggests being slightly cut off from the modern
world. Strange that, given she wants a slice of it.
But there are weird, non-worldy qualities in Burke. She thinks like a
scientist and walks like a trained ballet dancer, toes turned out in her
S&amp;M spikes. Among her friends she cites Edward de Bono, a
self-proclaimed radical, and theorises patly, about processes of
communication.
''Any scientist who can really explain something is the one who
understands it. The one who can't explain it to anyone probably doesn't
understand it himself. There's a stretch I call the Sir Walter Raleigh
because it's the way he would have bowed.
''A friend I admire very much is a writer called Edward de Bono who
created the whole concept of lateral thinking. He's written a lot of
books which conjour up the rigour of deduction and the Greek tradition
of logic which makes you prove some point until the point might not be
worth proving. His view is to think of new ways of doing things
creatively and not get stuck in a tunnel of deductive reasoning.'' And
this, she sandwiches with cellulite.
She goes on: ''I admired Warhol and admire De Bono. They're very good
human beings. There are some people who are very bright but their
brightness crushes the people about them, and there are other people
that are really bright but who give joy to everyone around them. And
that's a quality which is really important. I try to be and hope to be
forward thinking, it's one of the ways of staying young.''
* Thin Thighs For Life by Karen Burke MD PhD is published by Hamlyn on
May 25 at #7.99. Her skin-care products, Longevite, will be available
from June.

I FIND certain remarks by Joe Donnelly to be totally offensive (Stand
by your man, May 11).
To sneer at the Prime Minister for not having the smeddum to be
unfaithful to his wife and to suggest that infidelity would actually be
admired by the British public is a total reversal of acceptable
morality.
I am heartily sick and tired of journalists who deride purity and
morality in this way. It is symptomatic of a society which has a crying
need to return to those very basics for which the Prime Minister stands.
Are we reaching a stage of fin de siecle when one is supposed to feel

NOW class, who'd like to define the word ''choice'' for us? That's
''choice'' as in ''producer choice'', as in ''a modern, thrusting, lean
and efficient BBC'', as in, perchance, ''nae''.
Readers who have escaped exposure to the verbiage of modern
broadcasting might like to know, at this point, that ''producer choice''
is the corporation's attempt at an internal market. Naturally it is just
precisely as simple, sane, logical, and popular as the NHS version.
Dreamt up by the sort of people who inflicted savage redundancies on
the BBC and managed to achieve no savings whatever, producer choice
involves one set of employees notionally ''buying'' services, studio
time, dead parrots and so forth from another set of employees. No-one
seems quite sure why this is necessary, but it keeps large numbers of
bead-counters off the streets.
The trouble is, according to a source close to the licence-payer's
wallet, PC is also proving a strikingly successful way of keeping
broadcasters on the street. Allegedly, as the lawyers like us to say, it
has resulted in the main Aberdeen studio at Beechgrove being sealed up
because no-one in the BBC can now afford to use it.
In Edinburgh, it is further suggested, the news department now lacks
the wherewithal to rent studios for interviews. Our witness claims BBC
reporters are at present interviewing the great and the good in the
corridors of Queen Street just to avoid paying for engineers.
Meanwhile, the Diary understands that a ''confidential'' memo (yes, as
confidential as that) is doing the rounds of news and current affairs
which raises the possibility of space for a small ''self-operated''
studio being rented outwith Queen Street.
This would not only be cheaper but also, it was put to the Diary, ''20
times more efficient than the present system''. In other words, the
corporation has priced itself out of its own market and employees can
now only work for the BBC if they take care to avoid working with the
BBC. Brilliant, or what? Still, as our informant suggests, if news and
current affairs are really stuck they could always rent a studio from
Scot FM.
On the scent
A RECENT issue of Arena, the magazine of the Scottish Sports Council,
publishes a very useful list of banned substances, sports persons not
for the use of. You'll be relieved to learn that cocaine, morphine, and
heroin are right out. Marijuana, meanwhile, is ''restricted in certain
sports''. Yes, but which ones?
Upbeat reaction
WHATEVER the future holds, no-one can accuse Scottish Nuclear of
shirking its duty to persuade us all that its reactors are more fun than
Disneyland.
Every fortnight a newsletter is issued with the full, thrilling
details of the coach parties who have been exposed, if that's the word,
to Torness. In addition to a delegation from ''Edinburgh Electric
Retired Employees'' (batteries not included?), the East Lothian beauty
spot recently welcomed a party from Edinburgh University. Ideal, we
presume, for home assembly, these were listed as ''mechanical
students''.
All fired up
BLACKSMITHS are forging ahead with an exhibition of their craft which
runs at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum until July 9. Hitting the
nail square on the head, a press release states of Fe: An Exploration of
Iron through the Senses, ''Stunning just to look at, each work in
addition is capable either of being sat upon, played, pushed, heard or
smelled''.
There's a difference between blacksmiths and cobblers but we've
forgotten, just for the moment, what it is.
Doggone . . .
AGE Concern is a splendid and noble organisation, no question. Until
recently, however, the Diary was not aware that the charity offers
insurance services in addition to its other sterling work.
The usual thing: cars, travel, buildings, contents, and all excellent
value for money, we're sure. But here's a proposal form: ''Particulars
of Cats/Dogs to be Covered'', it says.
Yes, it's come to this: Age Concern Pet Insurance, in association with
Blue Cross, and underwritten by the Dog Breeders' Insurance Company
Limited, no less. For just #57 a year you can buy Rover (or Tiddles;
cats cost only #44) up to #1250 of top-class medical care, insure
against injuries he may care to inflict on third parties, or pay for a
reward if he goes missing.
Obviously, to people of a certain age for whom a pet is a cherished
companion, this is no joke. Nevertheless, it's not every loved one whose
insurance cover involves questions such as ''Please state whether any of
these animals have vicious tendencies. If 'Yes', please attach
details''.
Age Concern has also issued a leaflet entitled ''Pet Care . . . A Few
Helpful Reminders'', one of which is ''If your pet is still 'entire'
please think carefully about having it neutered. It is wise unless you
have plans to breed from your pet and will save both of you a lot of
grief.''
We can only guess Rover wasn't consulted on that last point.
''Remember,'' adds the leaflet, ''your pet doesn't speak English . . .''
Mel's memories
FINALLY, more news of the deep spiritual bond that drew Mel Gibson to
play William Wallace in the forthcoming Braveheart. In a recent
interview the Australian has explained the link.
''When I was a youngster of 20-odd I used to go out with my buddies
and we'd have a few beers and play pool and tell lies. The place we used
to go to was called the William Wallace Hotel and it had a painting of a
hairy guy over the bar. I thought he was just the dead former piano
player.''
Admirers of the creative impulse will also be cheered to learn that
Gibson has not allowed history to stand in his way. ''All those battles,
we cooked them. We just made up strategies and went for it. One battle
was known as the battle of Stirling Bridge, but I left out the bridge
because I wanted a horse charge.''
Historians can take consolation from the fact that the picture
includes a scene involving ''one especially devious trap laid for the
British cavalry by the ingenious Scots''.

Brussels
LABOUR's rumbling division on Europe threatens to burst into the open
today with several Euro-MPs set to defy pressure from Mr Tony Blair's
office by rebelling on a critical vote in the European Parliament.
Mr Blair has still not forgiven the majority of his 62 Labour Euro-MPs
for humiliating him earlier this year by voting to retain Clause Four.
They did so on the day he visited Brussels to launch the party's
European strategy.
The leader has now struck back by demanding that his big European
parliamentary group toes a moderate line on European integration and
must not be seen as pursuing a federalist agenda.
The row will come to a head in Strasbourg when the Parliament votes on
its vision of the European Union's shape after next year's
inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht Treaty -- a
process which could have a crucial influence on the result of the next
British General Election.
Britain's 62 Labour Euro-MPs have decided -- after pressure from Mr
Blair's office -- to abstain during voting on a policy report which will
come before the Parliament's plenary for ratification.
It is understood that pressure to support abstention was brought by Mr
Larry Whitty, former Labour general secretary, acting as an emissary
from the leadership. Mr Whitty travelled to Brussels last week to
present Mr Wayne David, the Welsh Euro-MP who leads the EPLP, with a
three-page typed report highlighting how the Parliament's view of
European integration conflicted with Labour policy.
However, Labour's consequent muddle could backfire by allowing an easy
ride today for the more federalist agenda proposed by the centre-right
coalition in the European People's Party which, paradoxically, includes
British Conservative Euro-MPs.
Last night, it appeared the Tories were also split on the issue. They
will decide tactics today.
Mr David Martin, Labour Euro-MP for Lothians and the party's leading
European constitutionalist, who drafted part of the report, said he
would defy the whip and vote for it.
He will be supported, it is expected, by Mr Ken Collins, Euro-MP for
Strathclyde East, the Parliament's most influential and experienced
committee chairman. Other EPLP members, including some Scots, are
expected to follow their lead. Mr Bill Miller (Glasgow) spoke in favour
of Mr Martin at a group meeting. Mr Hugh McMahon (Strathclyde West) said
he sympathised with Mr Martin but was undecided.
Mr Martin said: ''Westminster is preoccupied with winning the next
General Election -- and that is legitimate. But it is equally legitimate
for us in Europe to say that while we are not detached, our job must be
to develop a European policy and take a view of what is good for
Europe's future.''
Labour's ultra-cautious approach raises the potential illogicality of
most of its Euro-MPs abstaining in a vote on the party's own policy
which calls on Britain to sign the social chapter of Maastricht. Such a
vote, however, would be only technical because the plenary will also be
invited to back an amendment calling for no opt-outs from a revised
Maastricht treaty -- a move which Labour will support.
Mr Martin's recommendations on behalf of the powerful 221-strong
socialist group have been merged with those of Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges,
a French conservative federalist.
Their joint report seeks to increase majority voting in the Council of
Ministers so that the national veto -- a totem for British Tories -- is
removed to facilitate easier decision-making in most areas, including
foreign affairs, security, home affairs, and justice.
The EPP proposals would remove the national veto almost entirely but
the socialist version includes a number of clauses allowing the veto to
remain in the most sensitive areas.
Labour's abstention strategy was ordered by EPLP group leader Mr Wayne
David, who emphasised his support for Britain joining the social
chapter. He said: ''We strongly support the extension of qualified
majority voting in social and environmental areas, together with an
extension of codecision for the European Parliament.'' However, he
backed calls for retention of the veto in a common foreign and security
policy, taxation and other areas.
Labour Party officials said privately last night that a majority of
the EPLP had been gearing up to vote for the Martin report in its
entirety until they came under sudden pressure from London. ''Now very
few of them will rebel,'' one said, adding: ''They are still smarting
from being denounced as infantile by Tony Blair in the Clause Four
fiasco. They don't want another rocket.''
Labour's enemies were quick to condemn the confusion. Tory Euro-MP Mr
James Provan said he was amazed that Labour would not be voting
positively for the social chapter.
Labour's Mrs Pauline Green, the London Euro-MP who also leads the
socialist group, is embarrassed by the lack of support from her British
colleagues in today's division which, observers calculate, will be won
by a substantial majority for the more federalist vision of the EPP. She
was said to be voicing private support for Mr Martin and Mr Collins.

A DOZEN leading employers in the North of Scotland were treated to the
joys of ice-climbing in the Cairngorms yesterday in an attempt to
persuade them that men and women leaving the services make ideal
employees.
The three-day course, the first of its kind, has been organised by the
RAF's Outdoor Activity Centre at Grantown-on-Spey. The RAF is due to
shed 8600 personnel over the next 18 months. A campaign called Access to
Excellence has been launched to publicise the potential of former
service personnel.
Wing Commander Rob Littlejohn, who is working on the civilian life
resettlement programme, said it was felt better to let their guests see
at first hand how the services develop leadership, resourcefulness,
teamwork, and confidence.
Monday morning started with canoeing in the driving sleet and snow on
Loch Morlich, followed by an afternoon of orienteering. Yesterday,
ice-axes and crampons were needed, while today the group will be heading
off to Huntley's Cave, north of Grantown-on-Spey, for a spot of
abseiling.
''We are not just talking about people coming out of the forces in
their 30s or 40s but also in their 20s, particularly from the Army,
where people can leave after just five or six years.
''We thought it would be good for our guests to experience these
activities for themselves, so in the future they might recognise the
qualities and values in people coming from the services.''
He said that, while the public was aware of what the forces had done
in the Falklands or the Gulf and Northern Ireland, they did not always
appreciate the full background of training and experience these troops
had gained.
Those taking part included: the Highlands and Islands Fire Brigade;
Highland Regional Council; the Scottish Ambulance Service; the Scottish
Prison Service; WH Brown Construction; Hydro-Electric; and Baxters of
Speyside.
Ms Elaine Barrie, the senior personnel officer at Highland Regional
Council's manpower department, said she thought the scheme was
worthwhile.
''I have already come across a couple of people who have come out of
the forces. They go through their resettlement period and I think it is
really important that an employer recognises their skills, because they
are not always recognisable from their application forms,'' she said.

AWEEK ago, Michael Forsyth was a minister in an English department of
state with an unsafe seat in the wrong country. Today, he is again the
most interesting man in Scottish politics. It shows how fast, how
astutely, and how unexpectedly he can move. That is why his opponents
fear him. That is also why he should be in a Cabinet which, heaven
knows, has more than its fair share of gruesome mediocrities.
The portals of St Andrew's House offer an ideal way in. To say so is
not to damn Ian Lang. On the contrary, at Westminster he is one of the
Government's successes. In Scotland, too, his style -- cool, articulate,
managerial competence -- has in many respects worked well. It would be
excellent in almost every other set of circumstances than the one it has
actually faced, in which it has not averted defeat. Five years of the
Scottish Office are enough for anyone, at least for any Tory, and Lang's
talents would surely flower more abundantly in greener pastures.
Any pique on the part of the Secretary of State probably stems not
from disagreement with these basic facts, rather from Forsyth's tactics.
As we might expect, they are not gentle. A reshuffle is in the offing,
and the rising star means to make sure that it works out in his favour.
To that extent, he seeks to close certain options off -- for instance,
of Lang staying put. It may work and it may not, but it is certainly
less likely to work if he does not make his ploy. Younger readers ought
to be cautioned that this is how their elected representatives often
deal with one another, and is no cause for undue alarm.
The real question is what deeper differences lie beneath the
variations in style. The phrase attributed to Forsyth, and picked out by
ever pundit at the Conservative conference last week, is that the time
has come to ''address the problem of Scottish identity''. It implies
that this problem has not been adequately addressed by Lang or his
predecessors. And in coded political Doric it could bear the
interpretation that Forsyth intends to do something about devolution.
That is in fact the interpretation put on these words by every pundit.
I am sure they are wrong. Nobody, but nobody, has been more explicit
than Forsyth in condemning all proposals for a Scottish Parliament. Of
course he and any other minister will listen to ideas for improving the
constitution: they will, or ought to, listen to ideas for improving
anything. But the constitution they mean is the one we already have.
If the argument from strongly held and firmly stated principle is not
persuasive enough, let us adduce one from political expediency.
Forsyth's power-base in Scotland lies not among the great and good, for
whom he showed a healthy contempt the last time he was in St Andrew's
House. It lies among the Tory activists, who on the evidence of the
conference have shifted markedly to the right.
Or perhaps we should say that the party's travails have taken their
toll of all but the truest believers. Forsyth had only to step on the
stage of the Royal Concert Hall to raise their cheers, and there is no
doubt that they would be very happy to see him as Secretary of State.
For his part, he knows how important the Union is to them. It is for
many the only real reason why they have stayed with the Tories through
the endless disappointments.
In Scotland, the Government must therefore go forward with the Union
because it cannot go back on the Union. Otherwise it would destroy its
own constituency, with no assurance of finding a new one.
If, then, Forsyth is to go forward with the Union but wrap himself in
the saltire at the same time, what on earth can he mean? It so happens
that many of those activists equally regard the Scottish establishment
as an enemy. Ever since 1979 they have deplored their party's cosying up
to it, the consequent sinking into caution and complacency, the aversion
from ideas or people producing them, above all the fact that policies
laid down on high lost battles on the ground.
Surely Forsyth had that at the back of his mind when he spoke to the
conference of ''a society which is planned at the periphery by its
citizens, not from the centre by its leaders''.
To take the people's part against the establishment could add up to
that elusive formula which the Tories have long sought, of making
themselves more Scottish. It will not be easy, because at first it may
mean limiting themselves in a manner to which they are unused. But to be
honest, they have long forfeited a claim to be, for want of a better
term, a great national party -- in the sense that they still are, or at
least till two weeks ago were, in England, or again in the sense that
Labour is in Scotland, bringing together people from all classes and
regions.
The Scots Tories are a sectional party, even a fringe party, though
with the strange privilege of being in power. But fringe parties have
the advantage that they can unite ideologically, and innovate
ideologically, in a way less open to great national parties hirpling
along under the weight of their past and present baggage.
The first priority is a radical critique of the Scottish consensus, if
we can thus dignify the arid, Tammany Hall style of politics that we
practise. The aim must be to break it, and so give Conservatives a
purpose transcending whatever the electoral or constitutional future
holds. Initially, all this would have besides to be squared with the
compromises inseparable from the exercise of power -- but it is
presumably for just such a purpose that Forsyth wants the Scottish
Office.

ONE of these days Allied Domecq will have something cheerful to say in
sharp contrast to the cautious forecast for the remainder of calendar
1995 and in particular the disappointing results from the
Carlsberg-Tetley brewing division.
Putting it in bare terms, the merger has not yet worked sufficiently
well and savage pressure on margins resulted in a 21% fall in operating
profits to just #67m and with no early relief in sight as
Carlsberg-Tetley tries to recover ground in the take-home trade.
Chairman Michael Jackaman said that while it is not a core activity ,
Allied remained committed to brewing where it has a 17% share of the UK
market. However, the brewing side will not receive any substantial
injections of new capital.
The apparent contradiction seems to leave the business hanging in the
air and life is going to be pretty tough with further cost cutting to
come on top of last year's 530 redundancies.
The probable Scottish &amp; Newcastle merger with Courage should help
alleviate margin pressure. Courage is highly aggressive on the pricing
front in an industry suffering from excess capacity as well from imports
flooding in from France while S&amp;N is traditionally more measured in its
approach.
Chief executive Tony Hales said that some cross-Channel beer
bootleggers are using strong-arm tactics to force pub tenants to buy
beer smuggled from Calais, and again he called upon the Chancellor to
reduce the excise duty on beer to choke off cheap imports.
Ignoring exceptional items, Allied group pre-tax profits increased
12.3% to #701m in the 12 months to March 4.
Allied is in the complicated process of changing its year end to
August to more easily accommodate the Domecq acquisition which is highly
dependent on the pre-Chistmas trade.
Domecq's contribution more than doubled to #125m after it became a
full subsidiary and was earnings enhancing. The concern over Mexican
devaluation will be apparent this year as the peso has crashed from 4.81
to 9.81 to the pound since last December and the Mexican profits
contribution on the current rate would have fallen from #49m tom #27m.
However, overall spirits activities raised its contribution 4% to
#380m. That reflected volume growth in the important brands of 3% with
star performers including Ballantine's, Kahlua, Beefeater, and Tia
Maria.
Teacher's gained market share in England and Wales but not in Scotland
although the overall UK spirits market has softened since the duty
increase in January.
The main problem in spirits is to push through prices in international
markets of more than the 1%-2% being seen at present to offset the
greatly increased marketing spend.
Pub profits fell back due to the disposal of 881 units although the
underlying trend was stated as being positive with a greater emphasis on
branding such as Big Steak outlets. International retailing of
Baskin-Robbins icecream and Dunkin' Donuts with a combined near 8000
units makes Allied the world's largest food retailer.
Because of the situation at Carlsberg-Tetley and various disposals on
the food side, profits in the current six months will not match the
combined #47m seen in the latest half year.
This combined with the peso problem which has resulted in the net
asset value of Domecq falling to just #260m or so against the
acquisition cost of #995m forced the shares down 12p to 533p where they
trade at 16 times likely earnings. That is dear enough on fundamentals
but the present uncertainties will attract speculative rumours about
predators circling a company particularly strong in brands with a
reliable underlying balance sheet.
The dividend total is being raised by 24.1% to 27.55p thanks to the
second interim being a Foreign Income Dividend of 19.8p.
* ALLIED Domecq chief executive Tony Hales said yesterday that some
cross-Channel beer bootleggers are using strong-arm tactics to force pub
tenants to buy beer smuggled from Calais.
The company again called upon the Chancellor to reduce the excise duty
on beer to choke off cheap imports.

THE Siobhan Davies Dance Company, in their new ballet Wild
Translations -- premiered on Monday at the Crucible in Sheffield and
arriving at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre this Friday -- will be
performing to a somewhat unorthodox accompaniment.
Unorthodox? Well, even an aficionado might agree that a catalogue of
sounds to be danced to that includes birds, insects, cowbells, speech,
laughter, children's voices, a football match, a village scene and a
wheelbarrow, all laced into the more orthodox textures of a string
quartet, perhaps doesn't entirely concur with choreographic convention.
The sounds -- authentic recordings made in the South African village
of Venda -- are an integral part of the overall score to the work
Dancers on a Plane, composed by Kevin Volans, from which Siobhan Davies
has made her latest ballet, which will be played live on Friday by the
phenomenal Duke Quartet.
For composer Volans, 45, who now lives in Dublin, it's a case of what
goes around comes around, then comes around again. It's some 25 years
since he left his native South Africa and landed (by a circuitous route)
in Aberdeen, where he was renowned as a virtuoso pianist and a
post-graduate composer with a single aim: to storm the citadel of
European contemporary music -- Cologne -- and work with the guru of
modernism, Stockhausen, in whose music Volans was a specialist.
This he did, spending nearly four years as Stockhausen's teaching
assistant, and staying on beyond that to work with composer Mauricio
Kagel and pianist Aloys Kontarsky. ''It was an incredible learning
period,'' said Volans. ''There were rumoured to be around 400 composers
working in Cologne at the time. It was the centre of music in Europe. It
was a golden age.''
Even so, once he settled, one of the first things he noticed was a
sense of nostalgia for Africa. ''I missed the natural sounds of the
country, of Africans talking in the street, of the landscape, of singing
in the streets,'' he said.
That vague feeling was intensified when he was sent back to Africa by
a German radio station to record natural sounds and street music for a
radio programme. ''I realised there were far greater riches in South
Africa, so I decided to go back to my roots to investigate the
relationship of music to the natural environment.
''I got really involved with it,'' he said. ''In these vast landscapes
-- especially in rural areas, I found a whole different perception of
time and space. Western music transcends time and space -- a symphony by
Mahler, for example, takes you on an imaginary journey -- whereas
African music never takes you out of the context; it doesn't refer to
places, situations and time. The ultimate goal of African music is
trance.''
With Stockhausen, said Kevin Volans, the whole point was that he was
the architect of music. ''Everything was to do with proportions. In
Africa, I found a people who never perceive proportions; their music was
a natural event with a totally different orientation -- as natural as
birdsong, or a cloud.''
The dichotomy between the two cultures hit him when he travelled back
overnight from one of five African trips to attend a Stockhausen
premiere in Cologne. ''I had come straight from hearing this natural
singing of African girls collecting water to see eight ashen-faced
people, terrified, about to perform a new Stockhausen work.
''It was like the Emperor's clothes,'' said Volans. ''Though I
understood the music, I felt I was watching a living corpse -- the
school, in the late seventies, had outlived itself, lost its vitality.''
He then came under pressure and a deal of fire from Stockhausen himself,
who wanted Volans to sign a contract as his personal assistant. The
South African refused. ''It was a very difficult decision, to do
something totally different. But from that day, Stockhausen never
recognised me; I was transparent to him.''
After leaving Cologne, Volans pursued his roots, creating what has
generally been agreed to be a unique musical language. It's not a
language influenced by African music as such, but, in key works of the
eighties -- the so-called African period -- by the natural environment
of the country. ''The soundscape of Africa is so unique, specific and
rhythmic,'' he said. ''You cannot escape the natural background, the
landscape, the sounds of village life.''
En route, his music was taken up by the cult group, the Kronos
Quartet, who transformed Volans's White Man Sleeps into an iconic piece,
giving over 200 performances ,with 1500 broadcast perfomances in the
States alone. ''They used it as their theme song. I suppose I replaced
Jimi Hendrix in their repertoire,'' said Volans, with heavy irony. (He
became disillusioned with the Kronos over their treatment of his music,
and no longer works with them.)
Meanwhile, his music has been widely taken up by ballet companies --
over 20 companies are performing to his music, from the Vienna State to
Stuttgart. Siobhan Davies, for her fidelity to the music, is among his
favourite choreographers. And for the music to her new ballet, Wild
Translations, Volans -- though his African period is behind him -- has
returned again to his roots.
The new recordings from the African landscape which feature in Wild
Translations were made last year on a return visit to his homeland. The
way they are inserted into the composed string quartet is fascinating.
''It's rather like making windows in the fabric of the piece and
inserting photographic images of the world that gave rise to the
music,'' said Volans.
How it works choreographically we shall see on Friday. As pure music
(the Duke Quartet's new CD, just released, contains a recording of the
work) it is an intensely atmospheric and evocative experience.

A BABY was sent home from hospital with a one-and-a-half inch
hypodermic needle inside his stomach lining, an independent inquiry has
established.
A registrar looked at an X-ray of Benjamin Jones, born prematurely,
and decided the needle was a marker put there to point to a bruise.
Treliske Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, ''sincerely apologised'' and
admitted liability after reading the report, but no disciplinary action
is to be taken against anyone.
Legal advisers for the hospital and the baby's parents, Steve and
Andrea Jones, will discuss compensation. The couple will also seek
expert advice over possible long-term effects on their son, who is now
fit and healthy.
Benjamin was born six weeks prematurely on Christmas Day. When he was
10 days old, blood, lumbar puncture, and swab tests were taken and Mr
and Mrs Jones were told a lump had developed on his stomach. X-rays were
also taken on January 4.
Benjamin was discharged on January 12 and the needle was found by Mrs
Jones as she changed the baby's nappy at home on January 18.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust appointed Dr Neil Marlow, a
consultant from Bristol, and Mrs Trudi Cameron, the quality co-ordinator
of neo-natal services at City Hospital Nottingham, to investigate.
Their report showed that a senior house doctor stuck a needle in
Benjamin's hand to take a blood sample. Instead of disposing of the
needle, it was left in the baby's bedding or clothes then entered his
body through his abdomen and remained there for 14 days.
Mrs Jones, 24, said last night: ''We knew all along what had happened
and it was an apology we were owed for all the trauma of the last few
months.
''We are first-time parents and all we have had is worry. It does help
now the hospital has admitted liability and now we will try to be a
normal family.''
Mr Jones, 31, a Royal Navy lieutenant and an air traffic controller at
the Culdrose base in Cornwall, said: ''This report should have been done
much quicker. The trust have been hostile and aggressive and made things
difficult for us.''

PRESIDENT Clinton's popularity has gone up sharply in the past few
weeks, because of the dignified and appropriate way he responded to the
Oklahoma City bombing. Fifty-five per cent now give him a favourable
job-rating.
Simultaneously, the golden honeymoon for the Republicans that followed
their great Congressional victory last November has come to an end.
People are now looking Republican policies in the face, and like them a
lot less.
The far right has not modified its rhetoric despite the evident
connection between its propaganda and the mad paranoia of the bombers.
The National Rifle Association still refuses to repudiate a missive it
sent out just before the bombing which denounced federal agents as
''jack-booted Nazi thugs''.
Three Republican Congressmen with close ties to militia movements are
still frothing about international conspiracies to take over the
country, and several senators are nearly as hydrophobic. The tide of
paranoia, conspiracy mania, and self-righteous right-wing certitude is
still rising across the country.
The Republicans won last November on the promise to remake the
country. They won easily, and claim a mandate for revolution -- but only
20% of adult Americans actually voted for them and their revolution. Now
they propose to carry out their promises, notably one to balance the
budget.
Doing that means eliminating or cutting a great number of government
programmes, all of which are very popular with those who benefit from
them. Above all, they want to rein in the expansion of the costs of
Medicare, the health insurance service for the elderly.
There is a widespread misapprehension that anything from 10% to 20% of
the federal budget goes to foreign aid (the real figure is less than
1%), and that welfare absorbs most of the rest (it doesn't).
The Republicans propose to cut foreign aid and direct welfare payments
-- but balancing the budget means much, much more than that and all
those enthusiastic Republican voters and sympathisers are already
finding out that they do not necessarily like the details.
This is having one striking consequence. The Democratic party is
suddenly reviving. While a great deal of the Republican agenda in fact
makes for perfectly sensible policy the extremists have permitted the
Democrats to paint the entire Republican party as a collection of
gun-toting crackpots.
The President hammers away at the claim that the Republicans want to
gut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich. He is half right: the
party is, indeed, committed to cutting taxes for the rich. But the
President is also disingenuous: Medicare spending must be brought under
control if it is not to bankrupt the government.
The result is a more deeply divided country, and a much more
interesting political situation for the next election.
A few months ago, commentators unanimously conceded that the
Republicans would retain control of both Houses in 1996 unless there
were some drastic accident beforehand, and that Clinton's hold on the
White House was exceedingly precarious.
That's still the conventional wisdom, but things are now running the
Democrats' way. The Republicans have the bit between their teeth over
their programme. The grand lines of their budget proposals will pass
both Houses in the next week or so and over the next six months they
will push through the detailed legislation cutting agencies and
programmes.
They will back off a lot of items, of course, and it is probable that
political pressure will water their fine intentions down to a very mild
brew. But everyone in America who gets any benefit from a government
programme, starting with 40 million retired people, has had a nasty
scare and will think twice about supporting the Congressmen who proposed
taking away their goodies, even if they retreated at the last moment.
Clinton still has to overcome the fact that he was elected a minority
President. He will need to win most of Ross Perot's voters, or have
Perot or another independent run again, to beat even the dim Republicans
who will challenge him.
But things are going Bill Clinton's way, for a change. He, and his
party, will be running next year against the loonies and the people who
want to reduce old people's health benefits. Newt Gingrich and his
friends have not yet really understood that this can be a very powerful
platform indeed.

THE first thing that strikes you about Silviu Purcarete's bewitching
production of Phaedra, premiered 18 months ago at the Tramway, part of
the Brighton Festival last week, and to be seen in London International
Festival Theatre, Bristol and Leeds later, is the number of people on
stage. Purcarete produces stage tableaux like rabbits out of a hat --
one after another, slowly dissolving amoeba that merge then regroup (a
chorus of black, gnarled crones with shepherds crooks twice their own
size who strip off at the end as bare-breasted women to dance
triumphantly round a pile of young male corpses) -- contrasted against
the pure, blinding white of Hippolytus and Leni Pintea-Homeag's
statesque, imposing Phaedra.
Purcarete's Phaedra undoubtedly has great mythological weight and
sense of other-worldliness with its waxing, waning moon, resonating
Romanian zithers and stalking spectral goddess figures -- Chastity,
(Artemis, all tied up) and Love (Aphrodite, panting).
Paradoxically there's also a wicked sense of mockery about Purcarete's
production: the old crone's entrance is an extended theatrical joke
bordering on music hall. Gods, as we know, are capricious.
Yet the play's symbolism, the catastrophes that ensue if you defy the
deities (there's a definite homerotic tug to Hippolytus's rejection of
Aphrodite in preference for his young male friends) has both a powerful
political and psychological charge.
It's hard not to see in Phaedra's overpowering lust for the
bewildered, victim-like Hippolytus and the ageing husband Theseus as
some kind of reflection of Romania's craven Ceacescu family. At the same
time, Purcarete projects the women with a power that has a disturbing
sense of emasculation about them though to some, the ending offers
celebration. I wasn't sure -- though I was impressed.

PLANS to erect a #20,000 statue to a street newspaper vendor ran into
fresh controversy yesterday when a councillor claimed that the dead man
was a child molester.
The row began last month when it was revealed that Dundee's first
public statue this century would be erected in the city centre in memory
of the late Mr Tommy Small.
Yesterday, Tory councillor Neil Powrie, a vocal opponent of the
scheme, revealed that he had received a letter from an elderly lady
alleging that the newspaper seller molested her when she was a girl.
Mr Powrie, a councillor on both Dundee district and Tayside regional
councils, said: ''The elderly lady alleged that he molested her on her
stairs when she was a young girl. She wrote that her screams brought her
parents out and her father gave the newspaper vendor 'the beating of his
life'.''
Mr Powrie also said he had received two telephone calls from people
claiming ''child abuse'' by the vendor.
He explained that the letter had been sent anonymously but declined to
reveal the identities of the telephone callers.
The councillor emphasised that the child abuse allegations added fuel
to his opposition to the statue.
Mr Powrie said he had handed the anonymous letter to Tayside Police.
Mr Ian Mudie, assistant director of planning at Tayside Regional
Council, said: ''We have no knowledge of any of that whatsoever.''
He added that plans for the regional council to donate #5000 to the
scheme will be considered again tomorrow.
The sum of #5000 has already been promised for the statue by Scottish
Enterprise Tayside and the remaining #10,000 will be raised from public
subscription.

IF YOU are at all like me then your annual spring clean won't involve
detergents, vacuuming and mind-altering quantities of Fruits of the
Forest air freshener.
It will consist of manically attacking the untidiest cupboard in your
abode and emptying its entire contents into the middle of the room where
you will spend the rest of the day nostalgically oohing, aahing and
occasionally wincing over the contents before getting bored and chucking
the whole lot higgledy-piggledy back into the cupboard again.
Sorting through the accumulated debris of my life I am ashamed to be
confronted with the evidence of a hundred and one projects started but
never finished. I am a sad example of that staple of British sitcom
series, the habitual hobbyist; easily fired into enthusiasm but without
the necessary staying power to see things through.
Thus, the boxes full of leaking jars of varnish, dried-up tubes of oil
paint, tangled mess of coloured threads, starter bonsai sets,
undeveloped camera films -- the artsy paraphernalia which I can never
quite bear to throw out, always convinced that one day I will master the
craft. Frank Spencer eat your heart out.
Blue Peter is to blame. With its advent candle holders and bachelor
pads for Action Man, it encouraged children to create incessantly. We
could be anything, our career aspirations mutating week to week.
You want to be a cook? Just follow John Noakes's instructions (getting
an adult to switch the oven on) to produce insipid little fairy cakes.
Interior decorator? Some polystyrene egg boxes and strips of carpet
sneakily shorn off the edge of the bathroom mat and you had a palace fit
for a Sindy doll. Chemist? Mix soda crystals with garish food colouring
for super Christmas presents for unfortunate aunties. Result?
Generations who still thrill to the sight of a PrittStick and tubes of
glitter, generations of Brits hooked on hobbies.
The ingedients and equipment needed for Blue Peter's supposedly
''simple'' creations would be procured by hook, crook or hysteria and,
despite the programme's cheap 'n' cheerful ethos they would somehow
always cost more than purchasing the real thing.
This fact is the kernel of any cost-based hobby, you will spend
ridiculous sums in order to construct a shoddy, inferior version of
something you could easily buy at your Habitat or Oxfam.
And anyway, you'll never complete it. You might be full of
determination as you begin to make that authentic rag rug, ambitious
patchwork quilt or shell-covered, gold-sprayed mirror but you will never
finish it. Oh no you won't.
When your mate announces she is pregnant, your plans to crochet a
finely spun christening shawl will unravel as the months zoom by and
result in the last-minute panic-purchase of a mass-produced plush
product. It might not seem all that ambitious to try to strip a chair
and refurbish it, or to master Indonesian cooking, but it is. It's way
beyond you and the purchase of a plane or a wok won't change that one
jot.
But the informing principle behind hobbies continues to be the
twentieth-century consumer's mantra; I buy therefore I am. The more
money you spend the more convinced you will be; I bought a paint set /
pair of shears / telescope / saxophone . . . therefore I am an artist /
gardener / astronomer / jazz musician.
For a hobbiest the mere possession of the necessary accessories is a
confirmation of potential and that is enough. My most recent moment of
madness was spontaneously buying a pair of roller blades on the way to
the ballet one snowy afternoon. They are so cool. I like to take them
out of the cupboard and look at them now and again. Potentially, I am a
Baywatch babe. Hey, I don't feel obliged to prove it.
Muriel Gray hurling herself up any spare Munros lying around, Richard
Branson's enthusiasm for death-defying ballooning stunts -- these are
not hobbies, this is obsessive behaviour. These are addicts whose
erstwhile hobbies have taken over their lives.
Marti Pellow, who recently took up golf should be warned. A few
pleasant puts just now could lead to the Jimmy Tarbuck horrors of a
Pro-Am tournament a few years hence. Anyway, what's a pop star playing
at, taking up such a dreary sport? Marti, has an image to maintain, and
should be jet-skiing across Loch Lomond or snow boarding in Aviemore,
something more fitting to a rock'n'roll lifestyle.
The world is split into hobbiests and zealots, the dreamers and the
doers, and the difference is that we talk and they take action. We sign
up for classes, they actually go. We flirt with new talents, they
acquire them.
Frankly, there's no need for such showing off. I'm happy to dip in and
out of any fad or craze going and don't envy the doers their commitment
or their skills. I just envy them their cupboards, I bet they're much
tidier than mine.

A MAN out of time. Having spent the best part of the last decade
pursuing his Scott Walker/Jacques Brel fixation, Marc Almond has decided
to return to his electro-disco roots just as the resurgence in all
things Walkeresque begins.
Amazingly, it sounds every bit as refreshing as the lushly
orchestrated performance he gave at Barrowland some seven years ago.
Almond is coming to terms with both the future and his own past.
If Soft Cell's sleazy anthems of the early eighties then sounded thin
and ultimately unfulfilling they now sound more contemporary and in
keeping with the rest of his set. Fleshed out by three additional
musicians, his band play hard-core disco, a midway point between the
cool of Underworld and the pop camp of Erasure.
Bedsitter, Memorabilia, Sex Dwarf and Tainted Love all make for some
enchanting nostalgia, but there is also much to admire in the new songs
which make up the majority of the set. Almond is singing better and
looking younger than ever, and while his musical context may have
changed, his lyrics maintain their Brel-like observations and seediness.
Musically it's relentless and a bit one-paced, the exceptions being
Child Star and Brilliant Creatures, which builds into the type of huge
chorus Almond used to throw away by the barrel-load in the early
eighties.
It's an impressive first outing for an artist who looks set to follow
the Paul Weller guide to career resurrection: Addressing your past and
sticking rigidly to what you do best, in Almond's case vaudeville disco.

SCOTTISH Youth Theatre recognise a good thing when they're on to one .
. . and aren't afraid to make the most of it. Following up last year's
Mayfest success -- their staging of Wee MacGreegor -- this time round
sees the sequel, Wee MacGreegor Enlists. It's an inspired choice. The
tale of the wee Glasgow lad growing into adolescence, his troubles in
love and his witnessing of the horrors of the Great War is perfect
material for the young cast. There's something about their youthful
energy and sincerity that makes the couthily nostalgic piece seem funny
and heartwarming, avoiding the traps of mawkishness and
over-sentimentality.
Keith Munro and Mary McCluskey (who also directs) use the scarcely
original, but highly effective and entirely appropriate, formula of
flashbacks in their stage adaptation. The play opens with a battlefield
scene, allowing the cast the opportunity to indulge in 101 ways to die
-- a slow-motion game of ''American Falls'' -- amidst audience-startling
bangs and pyrotechnic explosions. We find our hero wounded on the fields
of Flanders, scenes from his Glasgow childhood flashing before his eyes.
Irene Harris's authentic multi-levelled set is used sensitively,
effectively accommodating the smooth flow of action between locations.
Well-tested, but confidently handled staging techniques put many
''professional'' Mayfest offerings to shame.
Familiar songs from the war, some with customised lyrics, children's
rhymes and original music punctuate the piece -- all performed with
precise pzazz, the voice of Anna Karina Hill deserving particular
mention.
Among a cast who, without exception, display an assurance and
confidence beyond their experience, James Shepherd, in the central role,
shows a fine line in comic timing, while handling the pathos of the
battle and love scenes with unaffected sensitivity. A good wee night out
for all the family.

SO Punk's not dead, then. Joyrider's blistering support set managed to
fuse our spiky old friend with long-hair powered-pop in such a way that
''buzzsaw'' hardly does descriptive justice to the sounds of industrial
demolition wrought by the rhythm section. Edinburgh's own Joyriders must
be spitting nails.
But when did you last encounter a Great British Band? Leaving Blur
aside, we probably need to go back to the Faces for the necessary blend
of hard rock, hook-ridden pop and laddish good nature. Well Terrorvision
are on that same trail. The fact that they've been on it, one way or
another, for nearly 10 years, means that they're happy to have arrived
at last and that they can really play.
Mark Yates is a versatile and unflashy rock guitarist, creating
interesting textures with bassist Leigh Marklew. Both are happy to grin
and bounce, leaving Tony Wright to deal with the crowd: ''Can yer 'andle
a new song a'right?'' Actually, it's a bit average, but they open with
one of the five hit singles from the hit album and the crowd are already
chanting ''Alice What's the Matter?''
The worst they can do is deliver energetic rifferama: the best is
good-hearted (and often compelling) pop-rock and big ballads, like Some
People Say, described by Tony as ''weepies''. Loony covers from
Beatleland and the jokey Police-related, New Policy One, are endearing.
If Terrorvision, from Bradford, want to be a Slade for the nineties,
they could probably be that too.

''IT'S a quarter to . . . SHADDUP! . . . 'n Ah really mean it from mah
hi-art . . .'' On-off, on-off. Like the flashing signs that forever
light up Vegas, these little sound bites nip and out of Steve Blake and
Drostan Madden's astutely tailored score.
Like the blue-and-yellow checked suits (designed by Sandy Powell)
these snippets give instant access to the brash, relentless hustle of
the place, and they echo the down-side such as the deluxe sincerity
that's wearing thin on top. It's against this clever backdrop that the
lad's go to town on the lurex allure and phoney values of Vegas itself.
On The Sofa finds them guying the plastic responses (and furniture) of
television chat shows. Snuggled together, four to a sofa, they nod and
react, squirm and feign interest like a row of synchronised puppets.
On comes another guest -- eagerly loping towards his date with
programmed inanity. The situation, the familiar body language are just
so nicely perceived, so neatly reduced to telling essentials -- but
then, it's always been a hallmark of Lea Anderson's choreography, this
flair for taking the commonplace and re-emphasising it so that audiences
get a new focus on everyday happenings.
Elsewhere The Fanshaws take up their ukeleles for a glorious rendition
of Just Wanna Be Your Teddy Bear. They look so earnest, so ordinary, so
uncharismatic -- even in those suits -- as they stand there
plink-plinking, gradually venturing into a step routine that even the
Shadows could eclipse. It's simply hilarious.
Altogether more sombre is the sleight-of-hand in Fear and Loathing --
the hand that courteously helps you into someone else's jacket will just
as deftly fleece you of it in the next move . . . but then, like the
razzmatazz, the gambling, the serious affectations that are all touched
on in the work, it's the threat of this glitzy city that probably helps
to send the adrenalin rushing.
All six lads danced with tremendous verve, individual personality and
a willingness to make balloons of themselves -- or at least wear them.
They also slipped into some seriously nifty suits that, when we beamed
at them, cast a special glow on the evening. What a pity more of the
MacBob's usual patrons didn't turn up to carry the torch for the boys.

THE problem with issue plays is that if you are reasonably well
briefed in the issue there's only so far the play can go before it loses
your interest.
Nicola McCartney's play for the young Glasgow company, Lookout, is
about acquaintance rape and the company is possibly right when it
speculates that the subject hasn't previously been dealt with on the
stage. It has, however, been talked about so widely in newspapers, TV
discussions and soap operas that it's asking a lot of a single play to
move the debate on significantly.
I don't mean to trivialise the issue -- if you haven't grasped the
idea that when a woman say's no, she means no, or that a charming man is
capable of becoming an rapist, then this play is definitely for you. But
if these aren't blinding revelations you're going to look for something
more.
It should be said that Easy which is also directed by McCartney, is
not without its rewards. Telling the story of a young married couple who
match-make his male boss and her pub-singing girlfriend, it's an
intriguingly constructed drama that intersplices scenes of ordinary
north of England life with well-sung pop songs and courtroom
cross-questioning.
Like the playwright, the four actors -- Astrid Azurdia, Lucy McLellan,
Grant Gillespie and Timothy Webster -- have a feel for the
inconsequential bickering of their lower middle-class characters, the
men vain and humourless, the women sharp and cynical, and the play is at
its best when the dialogue works up some abrasive speed.
But acting, direction and script are also very uneven and there are
many sequences that are not so much about ordinariness as ordinary in
themselves. Saved by a subtle sense of humour and an intelligent
performance by Lucy McLellan, it's never quite as dramatic as the
headlines would suggest.

MOST people remember Tanita Tikaram from the late eighties as a
nervous angst-ridden teenager thrust into the charts on the back of a
couple of catchy if oblique singles.
The intervening years have not been kind, and while her output may
have been prolific (she has just released her fifth album at the age of
25), her talents have been superseded by a multitude of female
singer/songwriters. Her sales, at least in the UK, have declined to the
point of near apathy, as an audience that would have been lost in a
venue half the size, got little over an hour's music and no support act
for their #10.
The two main reasons for Tikaram's ascent to fame remain intact. She
still looks like a young Elvis and sings in a deep, often attractive
voice loaded with world-weariness.
It's far from enough to maintain interest much beyond the first song.
Last night's performance dragged through her most recent material and
ended with the three best-known singles and a Herman's Hermits cover.
For the most part it's a mixture of the agonisingly dull and downbeat,
with a few up-tempo interludes during which the rhythmless singer seems
even more ill at ease. It takes the still jaunty Good Tradition and
World Outside Your Window to serve as a reminder of even a modest
songwriting talent.
Sixth-form poetics at 18 have a certain naive charm but to be peddling
the same seven years later is both naive and charmless. From singing
about twisting in your sobriety, her songs are now about elephants,
taxis and witches, the po-faceness doesn't even extend to a smile being
cracked during a song about ''the origins of yodelling in Bratislava''.
Tikaram needs not only to lighten up, but to stop passing off
unstructured and sense-free dirges as sensitive songwriting to avoid
falling further into a creative abyss. At 25 she is the grumpy
grandmother of sensitive rock.

WHAT a stoater. In its previous incarnations Liz Lochhead's Scots
translation of Moliere's classic satire on piety, has had a 1920s
setting, with an emphasis on Calvinistic preachiness.
Here, Lochhead, directing her own company, Nippy Sweeties, locates the
play in a post-war era, a staging which adds a new dimension to the
male-female tensions in the script, with Orgon's ongoing struggle to
assert his patriarchal authority looking more ludicrous in the face of
his wife Elmire's sassiness -- Carolyn Bonnyman as a glamorous blonde
who has clearly relished the taste of wartime liberation -- a
sharp-tongued servant who simply doesn't know her place -- Katherine
Howdyn screamingly hilarious as the saracastic Dorine -- and a sulky
daughter Marianne (Tracy Wiles) who has caught the whiff of teenage
rebellion.
Orgon is a man caught in a trap of his own making, eager to confirm
his own righteousness by offering succour to the ''holy man'' Tartuffe.
Tony Cownie plays Orgon as a cross between Pa Broon and Alf Garnett, a
comic-looking fool who flies into blustering rages, whose see-sawing
emotions are easily manipulated by the artful Tartuffe.
Sandy Welch's Tartuffe is derived from Ian Paisley-type bombast but,
despite the caricatured exuberance and the trousers-round-the-ankles
farcical seduction of Elmire, he conveys a chilling quality which adds a
thrilling frisson of danger to the ribald proceedings, a menace
exacerbated by masonic allusions.
The sub-plot of Orgon's mild treachery, betraying king and country as
well as his own kith and kin and the final deux ex machina pardon from a
benevolent monarch figure -- Mr Prince -- is historically muddled but
the late-forties setting allows stylistic panache and an ingenious use
of Amazing Grace. Amazing, Liz.

I READ your report about the Duke of Atholl levying a charge of #5 for
vehicles using the Glen Tilt road.
I fully support this move. I was employed some years ago as a ponyman
at the Forest Lodge in Glen Tilt, and part of my duties was to maintain
the road. This is no mean task and involves a lot of man-hours and
expense.
If it were not for the estate this private road would not exist, or it
would have long ago become impassable to vehicular traffic. If the duke
can recoup at least some of the cost of maintenance, then perhaps the
road will be there a little longer for people to enjoy.
During my time at the Forest Lodge no-one was discouraged from
visiting the estate or climbing any of the mountains, unless this would
come into direct conflict with deer-control activities, which obviously
have safety connotations, and the stalkers who make their living from
the hill ought not to be disrupted.
I usually found that both the climbers and the stalkers took a very
sympathetic view to each others' needs and had a generally good
relationship.
Many are quick to criticise people such as the duke for having too
much land or too much money. I wonder if this is because of a real
concern for the countryside or just plain old jealousy.
The other side of this argument is that such people provide a huge
amount of employment in areas that would otherwise be bereft of any work
for the local population.
By virtue of the sporting interests very large areas of countryside
are preserved in their present state instead of being turned over to
more profitable and ecologically damaging uses.

I AGREE that parking and access for disabled people at the Royal
Concert Hall in Glasgow are reasonably problem-free, and that the staff
are helpful (May 11).
Once inside the auditorium, however, those who cannot transfer from
their wheelchairs find that the seating arrangements leave a lot to be
desired. They have to sit in one row, while their non-disabled friends
or family are in the row behind.
Part of the pleasure of attending a performance with a companion is
the sharing of the experience, but this is difficult to achieve when you
are seated one behind the other. This is not a situation most people
would choose when booking seats, so why should wheelchair-users be given
no choice?
I seem to remember that Michael Tumelty commented on this in one of
his very first reviews from the new concert hall. I would love to hear
that the situation is different now.

AS a previous chief executive, I thought your headline, Fury over
Glasgow's new chief, just about summed up the present state of local
government (April 29).
The basic problem seemed to be the so-called ''defection'' of one
regional councillor to vote with the former city councillors in the
appointment of the new chief executive in the new Glasgow shadow unitary
authority.
At long last, after taking the easy route back in 1974 when unitary
authorities were identified as the best way forward, we now have one
door for the public to go through. Whatever happens, this is a major
step forward, and justification in its for the changes.
The bottom line is the public actually do not care who provides the
service (only 40% vote) as long as they receive it. The difficulty is
that many traditional councils are still hanging on to the old currency
of power equalling finance and number of employees rather than the new
currency of becoming a catalyst for the health (social and economic) of
their whole community.
I can understand their difficulty because society in general still
looks to finances as the bottom line. We do, however, need to look to
more human aspects, which are far more difficult to measure, to find a
way forward.
Local government long ago lost the support of the local community and
the fact that regional and district councillors are now squabbling over
whose pet officer should be appointed to the new shadow unitary
authority exemplifies all that is presently wrong with local government.
There are fortunately a number of officers, members, and councils
attempting to move things forward, but as long as the larger and
supposedly more powerful councils bicker amongst themselves like this
then it does the rest of local government no good whatsoever.
There is also the fact that Scotland, which is unfortunately well
behind England in trying and looking at new ways of working within local
government, is also incestuously appointing its new chief executives
from within. Not only can we not go outside Scotland but we cannot go
outside local government to look at the new chief executives.
Since many people are complaining about local government and the way
it is run, then surely we are perpetuating the past by this parochial
attitude.
If the chief executives had been worth their salt, and the Society of
Local Authority Chief Executives was looking to the future of local
government rather than protecting itself, we would have had an open
selection of future chief executives, as they will do in England and
Wales.

I didn't think the original -- in the old Bulletin of which I still

She was called Nan Bannerman and she was a clippie from Bathgate SMT

Was VE50 Day in Scotland cancelled through apathy?
From the perspective of a first-generation post-war child, I would
cite the disappointment and bewilderment that both of my parents, who
served extensively in the Armed Forces, portrayed.
It is remarkable that the capital of Scotland felt comfortable in
meeting its obligations to this very special day with what appeared to
be a token gesture of commemoration at St Giles'.
This excluded the majority of ex-Service men and women from the
opportunity to remember and pay their respects to fallen comrades who
gallantly gave the United Kingdom the freedom that it has today.
Respect and admiration for the men and women who fought and died for
this country is never to be forgotten. The opportunity to organise the
celebration of good over evil in Europe has been accomplished elsewhere:
is it the case that VE50 Day was a low priority objective for those
empowered to provide suitable and respectful ceremonies that this
special day demanded?
Will my Scottish parentage suffer the same humiliation on VJ50 Day?

MALCOLM CAMPBELL is correct in his recollection of a wartime appeal
for bananas for a certain group of sick children.
I was one of those children, diagnosed as suffering from coeliac
disease. In the 1940s the treatment was total bed rest, a no-fat diet --
and bananas.
I only got one fresh banana during the war, won by a great-aunt as
first prize in a raffle. It had a very black skin by the time it reached
me but I remember that the fruit itself was still delicious.
Later we were supplied with dried bananas. I was meant to eat four of
these shrivelled black objects daily. I just couldn't swallow them
without gagging, particularly after my brothers labelled them
''mummified fingers''.
Now, nearly 50 years later, I am perfectly fit and have out-grown all
my early problems, bananas or no bananas.

FOLLOWING my letter (April 9) about the designer and the building of
Arden House, Loch Lomondside, I have had a prompt and very helpful
response from the great-grandson of Sir James Lumsden, for whom it was
built in 1868.
This confirms my suspicion that the architect was not Sir John James
Burnet (1857-1938) -- as you reported -- but was actually Sir John's
architect father, Mr John Burnet (1814-1901), who built Arden House for
Sir James, then the Lord Provost of Glasgow. The house remained in the
Lumsden family until 1981.

TO THE outsider, or customer as we must be called henceforth, the
Scottish Office has often appeared to display all the hallmarks of a
really good urban guerrilla organisation. That is, it is composed of
cells which act independently, do not speak to each other, indeed do not
appear to be aware of each others' existence. Needless to say, the
effect of the cells on the outside world is either negative or wholly
disruptive, and sometimes both. Like all effective guerrilla groups it
has been difficult to penetrate, and uncovering one aspect of its
operations leads all too easily to the perception of endless Chinese
boxes still to come. If this is unfair, we apologise. Rest content, it
is an opinion formed of long experience and some affection. Nevertheless
the Scottish Office performs functions of obvious importance and when
restructuring is in the air we should all perk up and pay attention.
The first thing to say about the changes, announced as a consultation
document yesterday but all too likely to be implemented with some speed,
is that they could have been a good deal more radical. This is evident
from the options which have been considered, ranging from a sort of
nihilism on wheels which would have dismantled most existing
departments, to an overwhelming devotion to business and customer focus,
an approach which has rendered great offices of state in some other
nations into little more than business development units. Thankfully,
the more extreme suggestions have been rejected, though what remains is
seeded with little organisational grenades which might yet detonate
under the impact of conflicting pressures.
Welding environmental issues on to agriculture and fisheries is a
novel concept which could work very well, depending on the weight given
to the different sections. Environmentalists will fear that their
concerns will be slighted when put in close proximity to the
heavy-hitters of agriculture and fishing. This must not happen, and it
is obvious that there could be creative benefits from closer working
relationships, depending always on equitable treatment. Lumping industry
and education into one department is more problematical; again it is a
question of balance. Scottish business needs education to be responsive
to its needs and much good has been done already. But education is not
just about developing the business-wise. Education in its widest sense,
which is of paramount importance in a civilised society, should not be
streamed into the service exclusively of business. A firm sense of
proportion is necessary here.

IT IS common to characterise the treatment of the various diseases
described together as cancer as something of a lottery in this country.
If only that were true. The idea of a lottery implies that everyone has
an equal chance of winning or, in the medical equivalent, an equal
chance of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This is not the
case with cancers, and it has taken the determined work of (among
others) a number of courageous women, many of them sufferers of
inefficient diagnosis or defective treatment of breast cancer, to make
the point. It is now generally established that treatment of breast
cancer, and of a whole range of other cancers, varies widely depending
on where you live and how knowledgeable your GP is on the various merits
of local specialists, as well as a range of other variables less
directly susceptible to prompt diagnosis and care. These local, and
sometimes extremely local, variations are one of the most impressive
reasons for a through reform of this aspect of the National Health
Service. By that we do not mean the wholesale upheaval, bed and hospital
closures, imposition of utterly inappropriate market demands, and the
employment of myriads of administrators, all of which have characterised
the reforms of the present Government.
More to the point, and to the improvement of the service, is the
searching review of provision for diagnosis and treatment of all cancers
in Britain with the aim of establishing a high and widespread level of
service. It is not in dispute that this is needed. A few weeks ago the
Government promised to re-shape services so that there would be greater
general access to new and more effective treatment. After so many years
of disruption in the health service it is a little late, to say the
least, to be turning to this task only now. New comparative European
figures show that people in England and Scotland have a far poorer
chance of survival if they suffer from a range of common cancers than
patients in other Western European countries. Lung-cancer patients in
Britain were warned this week that treatment was a lottery with many
failing to receive even basic care. The same strictures do not really
apply to the review of breast screening records in Scotland which,
although desperately distressing for those involved in the tiny
percentage of errors, is more a matter of procedural errors after
clinical assessment. To achieve a proper improvement an overall control
is necessary and the power to push through reforms. This is not a task
just for administrators, or just for specialists; it is a collaborative
effort which should be undertaken with urgency.

LIKE the Lord High Executioner, most of us probably have a little
list. According to a survey, one of the chief preocupations of office
day-dreaming is planning revenge on our colleagues . . . ordering the
boss a set of encyclopaedias, perhaps, or the attentions of a kissogram
lady. Most of us, alas, are too fearful take the matter further.
Telephone calls can be traced. Even disguised, our handwriting might be
detected, as could our fingerprints. So there is much to be admired
about those who actually do take revenge. When Mr Bob Allen, a
37-year-old landscape gardener, was recently charged #130 for a #20
overdraft, he marched into his bank at Belper, Derbyshire, and tipped a
sack of cowpats on the counter. ''They were giving me rubbish, so I
thought I'd give them some back,'' he said. Mr Allen received a police
caution, but is enjoying the glow of local hero-worship.
Mr Allen's spontaneous action may be compared with that of Martin
Fitzgerald, of Northallerton, a 52-year-old postman who had been
brooding since 1962 over a fine for five shillings for cycling after
dark without lights. He was convicted on the evidence of WPC Stella
Kilvington, and it might be thought that sending her a rude Christmas
card, 30 years later, would be be beyond detection. Modern technology
traced it back, however, and Mr Fitzgerald has not only been bound over
for two years, but ordered to pay Mrs Kilvington #100 for the distress
she suffered.
Forgiving adversaries is difficult, of course, although the older and
smaller we are, the easier it is to resist the temptation of actual
physical action. After all, we think, the Almighty laid into the
Egyptians with plagues of frogs, boils, locusts, etc, and if our case is
good enough, when He gets time, He will surely do the same thing for us.
The best advocate of trying to ignore grudges entirely was Miss Clara
Baryon, founder and president of the US Red Cross. When she was reminded
of a wrong done to her, many years earlier, she claimed not to recall
it. ''In fact,'' she said, ''I distinctly remember forgetting it.''

Building on Sustrans' success with off-road routes, the region has

through the provision of a number of on-road safer-signed routes. And
there are more to come.
While, as with any new initiative, a degree of fine-tuning will be

Mel Gibson is gambling that worldwide audiences are ready for a wild,
action-packed, costume epic based on the exploits of William Wallace.
Douglas Thompson reports
THE instructions on the shiatsu massage machine Mel Gibson received
for his thirty-ninth birthday on January 17 this year were emphatic that
it should not be used on the head. That's exactly the first place he
tried it out, wielding it like a mini-Hoover over his skull.
Mel Gibson enjoys sticking his size-16 neck out.
He also needs to do something with his hands. He's given up his
40-a-day Marlboro man habit. He's been a superior inhaler since he was
15 and has frequently tried to stop. When he does he fidgets and jokes
around, anything to blank out the nicotine craving.
This time, his fourteenth non-smoking attempt, he's doing it cold
turkey -- which he fervently hopes his film Braveheart, the most
extravagant risk of his hugely successful career, will not turn out to
be. He is gambling nearly $20m of his own money, $50m of other people's,
that worldwide audiences are ready for three hours of a wild,
action-galore, championship costume epic based on the exploits of
Scotland's William Wallace.
Gibson has been dealing with Hollywood, for whom Kevin Costner is a
historical figure. Wallace, who they regard as ''some guy in a dress who
wears blue make-up'', sets them in Cindy Crawford mode. It required the
involvement of several major movie studios, all hedging their bets, for
the Braveheart financial package to be raised. Gibson is co-producer,
director, and star and with the $70m budget -- before an anticipated
$30m in marketing and advertising costs -- was responsible for the
largest production ever undertaken by an actor/director.
For this and a round-up of ongoing problems from the early days of
filming around Fort William and in Ireland he dubbed himself Mad Mac.
Throughout the production, handicapped by rain and mud and midges, he
lived by the alarm clock. On each, often 20-hour, day he put on his
light Scots brogue, shoulder-length red hair extensions, a ragamuffin
kilt (underneath were specially designed briefs with strings to tighten
the sides) and different hats: one moment actor, the next director, and
always a producer. He pulled a groin muscle getting on a horse, was
nearly injured in a mob scene and all the time had to deal with nervy
Hollywood executives. He lived on caffeine and tobacco.
He says that through stress he lost the place and his temper a couple
of times. But he never totally lost his madcap sense of humour, his
prankster mentality for which he is known as the Fourth Stooge. When the
first reels of film made it over the Atlantic the ''suits'' were
horrified about ''Mel Gibson in a skirt''.
''They're not kilts as you imagine them,'' says Gibson explaining:
''They're simply blankets to keep your balls warm.''
Gibson did well to keep his covered, for they were and remain on the
line. The year of pre-production and filming is over but Gibson sitting
in a lounge of a Beverly Hills hotel knows that the uphill march goes
on.
Will the Mad Max/Lethal Weapon audiences warm cinema seats for William
Wallace? And, initially, the important numbers will involve American
cinema-goers. In Britain and the rest of Europe and Japan a Mel Gibson
movie is a passport to at least $100m.
But it is on Hollywood's home turf where the box office matters most.
Not only in the bank but in the perception. On the surface at least Mad
Mac remains relaxed. Cigarette withdrawal and the resulting added stone
and a half of weight (20lbs) seems more of a concern. He's been fasting
and eating apples but in mock horror admits: ''I've got spots''.
So far, not before the eyes. Although during filming he often thought
that a possibility. He had been thinking about Wallace the Scots rebel
who took up his 5ft sword and led his followers in battle against the
English for several years. He had once rejected Braveheart because
although he liked the concept he found the script ''too corny''. When
Alan Ladd Junior left MGM studios he was allowed to take two projects
with him. Braveheart was one. Gibson contacted him with a deal. If he
could direct and change the script he would do it. A merry-go-round of
financing went on. He waived his salary (usually $10m to $12m a movie)
and chucked in $15m and extra to keep the film a possibility as
pre-production arrangements and haggling went on.
''I never really lost interest in the idea -- and look where it landed
me,'' says Gibson who is a William Wallace fanatic. ''People just kneel
down and pray when they hear his name. The guy was the Second Coming of
Christ. He had a vision that, for someone his class, was far ahead of
his time. He didn't use Machiavellian tactics. He would just keep at
people and at them until they agreed. People would just follow him into
hell. He was very magnetic.''
Well, not always. On a historical note he points out that following
the Battle of Stirling Bridge -- 30 days' filming, 10 cameras, 3000
Irish Army recruits as extras -- Wallace ''skinned the opposing general.
He skinned him and made a belt out of him''.
Gibson the director is true to his hero who goes from rebel to savage
to true revolutionary. He also zooms in on the hand-to-hand fighting,
the crude carnage of the day. He was concerned that there were some
scenes that were too gory. A test screening proved him right when half a
dozen women walked out. He has edited out some violence, but said: ''You
don't want to gross people out but I think they have to feel what a
thirteenth-century battle was like. It can't be a comfortable
experience: horses falling, people slugging each other with blunt
instruments.
''The story's insanely heroic. And we went for the authentic look.
These people lived on raw meat just about. It isn't Brigadoon.
''I didn't use blood bags -- there's not a lot of blood-squirting. The
worst thing is the ball and chain. But I'm leaving it in.
''It's horrible. I love it.''
In the scene Wallace deals with a turncoat clansman by giving him the
equivalent of a Glasgow kiss with the ball and chain. ''It's like the
horse's head in The Godfather. It's what people remember.''
What those who worked on the film recall is Gibson's superhuman
energy. ''I used to get a twisted kind of pleasure making people wonder
how I kept going. You've got to have three hats on and be incredibly
physical and have the brain working all the time.
'It was like getting your mind to will stuff to happen that normally
shouldn't. To defy nature. I said I was going to shoot no matter what
the weather was and I did because I didn't have that much money and I
had a huge film. Some days were absolutely freezing cold and I was
wearing a dress and a sleeveless shirt, sitting on a horse while fire
hoses with ice water coming out of them were aimed at me. And I had to
sit there for hours and not complain and not yell and not shiver.
''And that requires madness. That is madness.''
The madness, like the Stooge games, is an act, an illusion. He prefers
the daft laddie image for it suits his purposes. Now, he quietly gets on
with the job(s). He's had his flings -- many tequila sunsets rather than
sunrises. ''God, my twenties were just awful. I hated them. I was really
an uneasy sort of person. That's when you do all your drugs and drink
and everything because you don't know what the **** to do. 'Cause you
just don't like being in your own skin so you try and get out of it. It
doesn't work.'
Mel Gibson works hard. He is an action star who has strayed from the
conventions of those films in The Year of Living Dangerously, The
Bounty, Mrs Soffel, Tequila Sunrise, and The Man Without A Face with
which he made his debut as a director. He is that dangerous hurdle, a
likeable superstar. Certainly, he has faults but he is an amiable man
who has dealt with the early pressures of fame reasonably well. He has
moved on at his own pace. Fast. The adopted Aussie blazed on to the
international scene as the post-apocalyptic avenger Mad Max.
With the Lethal Weapon series came another breakthrough. The script
was the blueprint for the movies but Gibson and co-star Danny Glover
did, he says, embellish like mad. There will be more outings for
Detective Martin Riggs. The popularity of the films recalled the
must-see days of the early string of James Bond movies. The formula was
similar. Entertainment. And lots of action defined by hair, rather than
conscious, raising shoot 'em ups.
Before Pierce Brosnan became the latest 007 it was Gibson who was
being touted for Goldeneye. He enjoyed the game. Much has been made of
his height (he says he's 5ft 10in tall) and he recalls one story: ''It
had me as a midget Bond. Every paragraph had an adjective about my size,
a pint-sized Bond. I had to laugh. I might be puny in the brain power
department but that's that.''
Instead, he took the title role of Bret Maverick based on James
Garner's popular television series and the film was one of the great
successes of last year. It was Mr Amiable playing Mr Amiable.
But Gibson is not always cool. He admits he lost it on Braveheart
going, as he puts it, ballistic. Richard Donner, who directed him in the
Lethal Weapon pictures, says: ''He's a real tough son of a bitch
underneath. There's a lot of anger and hostility. I've seen him come to
the edge, seen the pot start to boil, and I know to back off and let
others back off.''
He does not apologise for it. The occasional snap eases the stress. It
boils over and finishes quickly. He'd rather have the pressures of films
like Braveheart. ''It's chancy, a risk, but that's what this business is
all about. Challenges and the risks involved with them.''
It was in Scotland that he took his first big leap taking the title
role of Hamlet. Initially, it provoked disdain. Zsa Zsa as Gertrude?
Carry On Shakespeare? Gibson did his toughest and most physical work
until Braveheart. Hamlet was almost a dress rehearsal although for that
challenge he gave up smoking to help his lungs deal with the Bard's
words. No-one said he was better than Olivier or Burton or Finney or
Barrymore or Gielgud but they didn't laugh either. He was a serious,
compelling Hamlet for the 1990s was the almost unanimous verdict. Glenn
Close was Gertrude and an extraordinary list of British stars filled in
the lines and the gaps.
Custume and classic and Scotland. The experience, the work that paid
off, stayed with him as he flirted with Braveheart. He doesn't always
pick winners -- look at Air America and Bird on a Wire -- but said with
a smile: ''I always follow my instincts. Now, my instincts may trip me
up but when they blow in my ear I'll follow them anywhere.''
In 1968 he had no choice but to follow his father from Peekskill, New
York, to Australia. He was 12, the sixth of 11 children, of Anne and
Hutton Gibson. His father is a Genghis Khan of a Catholic who banned
television and berated his offspring about the evils of sex without
marriage, drinking, and smoking. He wrote religious tracts and often
disagrees with the Vatican's ''lenient'' views. He finds the present
Pope a heretic.
His son and daughter-in-law Robyn have six children aged from six to
14 and sprawling ranches in Sydney and Montana. Gibson finds his most
absurd offer the pitch from a company asking him to be their Official
Spokesperson for their line of condoms. He laughs: ''Hi! I'm Mel Gibson
and I'd like to show you . . .'' This from a guy who has a truckload of
kids!'
He says his family gets him through the darker side of fame. And his
humour. He travels on an American passport but says he's not at home
there or in Australia. He is as ambiguous as his accent.
For the moment it's that Scots brogue which he hopes will enchant
audiences worldwide. One Scots lady who was asked in Fort William High
Street about Gibson as Wallace and Liam Neeson as Rob Roy offered:
''They should have got Sean Connery to play them both! A guid Scots
actor.''
Mad Mac aka McMel said: ''I don't recall any animosity. A few sly
chuckles maybe''.
He recalls the Scots way with a chuckle: ''They wouldn't say much in
front of you -- it happens at yer back.''
And, of course, he had the ball and chain.
He'll soon know if it was too much weight for one man to carry.
Gibson never totally lost his sense of humour, his prankster mentality
for which he is known as the Fourth Stooge
People would just follow Wallace into hell. He was very magnetic

A FEW months back I described my paperchase of correspondence with the
Prime Minister on the question of Scotland's right of
self-determination.
It was conducted over a period of 14 months as I attempted to force
John Major to accept what his predecessor had freely conceded in her
memoirs -- that if Scotland determines on independence then the game's
up with Westminster.
Procuring a straight answer on this Scottish question was no easy task
but after a period of time Major finally answered the question head-on
and in the affirmative. In a letter at the end of January he confirmed
to me that his position was ''essentially the same as Lady Thatcher's''
and added (rather petulantly, I thought) that the correspondence was
closed.
Paddy Ashdown, to be fair, has needed no prodding whatsoever on this
issue. Last month in a BBC Scotland interview he declared that he would
always accept readily the democratic verdict of the Scottish people.
Over the years the same point has been accepted by Unionist
politicians of all hues and views. Even Ian Lang and Michael Forsyth
have managed to agree on it! There is, however, one outstanding
exception to this democratic consensus about the rights of Scotland and
that, remarkably enough, is the Leader of Her Majesty's loyal
Opposition, Tony Blair.
For someone who has pitched his political tent on facing his own party
with some uncomfortable home truths Tony seems very reluctant to engage
in debate about self-determination for Scotland. Since February I have
written three times asking him to agree with the Prime Minister's
opinion. I've yet to receive a reply.
It would be truly remarkable if the Labour Party had managed to choose
as its leader someone who is prepared to deny Scottish democracy three
times. Thus far Blair's position is far from defined but there is
significant cause for concern.
The Labour leader's knowlege of Scotland seems somewhat basic. On
Friday he made a speech in Perth calling for ''Britain to call itself
one nation, a truly United Kingdom''.
Even Unionist diehards usually would accept that Britain is a
multinational state, not a nation. It is possible that Blair is speaking
out of simple ignorance of Scottish circumstances. Perhaps the Fettes
curricula in the 1960s didn't dwell over long on Scottish history or
culture. No doubt things have improved since.
However, Blair is also suffering from an overdose of arrogance. In the
BBC's Scottish Lobby programme of March 5, the Labour leader repeatedly
refused to spell out what he believed would constitute a mandate for
independence, describing a prospective majority of SNP seats as ''a mere
fact'' and suggesting that ''no sensible person would countenance
independence''.
This brusque dismissal of the independence argument occurred only days
after an opinion poll suggested that the prospect of Scotland becoming
independent was supported by 37% of the population, the most popular of
the constitutional options.
I would have thought that there must be the occasional ''sensible
person'' among the more than a million who, according to this poll, hold
the independence viewpoint.
Just in case it is thought that my letters got lost in the post or
that the BBC caught him on a bad day Blair returned to his theme in an
interview in the Courier and Advertiser last Thursday.
Once again he described the possibility of a majority of SNP seats as
a ''mere fact''. Rather astutely the interviewer then questioned him
about the apparent contradiction in supporting a peace process anchored
on self-determination in Northern Ireland while questioning it in
Scotland.
Ah, said Blair, ''there would be a referendum in Northern Ireland''.
And then he conceded that a majority of seats for the SNP would provoke
a ''rethink''.
It seems somewhat strange to insist on a referendum for the SNP's
constitutional option while having no plans to similarly test Labour's
devolution scheme but I suppose we should be grateful that if Scotland
opts for a majority of SNP MPs the Labour leader has at least agreed to
think about it!
As it happens the SNP have made it clear that independence is not an
event but a process. An SNP victory in a General Election would be
followed by negotiations and then by a constitutional settlement being
placed before the people in a national referendum. Scotland will only
become independent by popular consent and not by stealth or
sleight-of-hand.
However, in any democratic system an election victory has to mean
something and politicians who call themselves democrats have to learn to
accept the results.
Although I have always found him personally engaging and talented I
have never had much time for Tony Blair's politics. For some
considerable period before the awful truth dawned on sections of his own
party, Blair struck me as someone who would be perfectly comfortable
leading a post-Thatcher Conservative Party.
However, this issue goes beyond politics. Blair's ignorance or
arrogance on the Scottish question should be of concern to more than the
SNP. He is expressing an anti-democratic viewpoint which would see any
Tory booed off the stage at any public meeting.
There is no significant UK politician in recent memory who has been
more dismissive of the national rights of Scotland. And therefore there
is no Labour leader in recent memory who has been less deserving of
Scotland's support.

* FARMERS' leaders have adopted a positive approach to the creation of
a new structure which will graft environmental policy on to the existing
framework where agriculture and fisheries is eventually the
responsibility of one departmental secretary -- and one minister.
Agriculture minister Sir Hector Monro is also fisheries minister and
environment minister, so there is logic in bringing the different
strands of his ministerial roles together into one department. When
departmental secretary Muir Russell is required to give policy advice,
his opinion will be based on information coming from within his own
(enlarged) department, so the environment ''slant'' will not be seen as
an outside influence.
Mr Tom Brady, chief executive of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland, takes the view that farmers are already deeply involved in
environmental concerns. ''What it means is that our man who maintains
liaison with the environmental side of the Scottish Office will now be
going to the same office as the rest of us,'' he said.
The reshuffle does run contrary to some of the views likely to be put
by the Rural Forum to the Scottish Affairs Committee investigation into
the future of Scottish Agriculture. The forum sees an argument for
bringing agriculture more directly under the influence of those
departments dealing directly with industry and tourism.
The environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth fears that the
changes could represent a downgrading of environmental interests, now
seen as being packaged together with agriculture and fisheries.

CULTS are born not made. Shoko Asahara, guru of the doomsday sect Aum
Shinri Kyo, organised the escape committee for some of Japan's finest:
young scientists, professionals, technicians, graduates of the best
universities. He is under arrest. His power, though, is not contained in
a prison cell.
From the photographs we see a pudgy man in pyjamas, squinting into the
camera: a soft, fat, hairy hippy. We think we have seen him, or his
barefoot like, before. Unlike other hand-crafted divines who have drawn
misfits to sit at their feet -- the Indian Bhagwan Rajneesh, Jim Jones
in Guyana, David Koresh's Branch Davidian -- his sphere of influence
seeps far from the commune in the foothills of Mount Fuji, the very
symbol of Japan.
Its secret underground lairs held stratas of destruction. Police
carried caged canaries to help them detect deadly gases. They found tons
of the nerve gas sarin, dynamite enough to explode a city, chemicals to
kill millions. Then came guns and lathes for making weapons, a Russian
military helicopter and recipes for germ and viral warfare, stashes of
gold worth millions. And they unearthed notes to indicate the sect was
in negotiation to buy access to Russia's nuclear and laser weapon
technology.
Those drawn to the sect of the Way of Divine Truth are no ragbag of
misfits, dope-head drop-outs or the banal young engaged in some escapist
spiritual adventurism.
Rather, according to some Japanese commentators, they may be an
emotional underclass looking for a less materialistic, if no less
rational, shining path to advancement than that offered by stifling
hegemony. Like America after Oklahoma, the country seems mesmerised that
the cells of Japanese culture have turned malignant and threaten their
own.
In a state where advancement comes only after decades of devoted
obeisance to convention -- a decade of fiercely disciplined schooling,
20 years hard work to become an under-manager, 30 for a divisional
outposting in the rigid hierarchy of the car plant -- the Aum recruits
fancied their chances of fashioning a new state in the image made by
Guru Asahara, a half-blind man. He offered a fast track to power.
The spiritual element, melded from an eclectic mix of Hindu, Buddhist
and Tibetan tantric practices, spoke to something beyond the regimented
search for material assets and devotion to the work ethic.
Chief spokesman for the sect, a handsome young man named Fumihiro
Joyu, used to work for Japan's space agency; a brilliant scientist who
in a bizarre twist has become a cult figure in his own right, attracting
hordes of swooning adolescent girls to the police station where he is
held. He has a fan club now.
Head of the sect's intelligence, Yoshihiro Inoue, at 25 the chief of
covert operations, was arrested with explosives, drugs and chemicals in
his car. The man who is charged with commanding the nerve gas attack on
the Tokyo subway system, which killed 12 people and sent 5500 to
hospital, is no riff-raff outcast but the highly educated son of a
respected professional family.
Another member is one of the country's leading lawyers, graduate of an
elite university. Astro-physicists, chemists, engineers, all became
priests in Asahara's feudal gurudom.
More than 60 present or former members of Japan's army, including
helicopter and tank specialists, are said to have been members of the
cult. They formed a special unit dedicated to the military overthrow of
the Japanese state. Two of them leaked vital information to the cult
about police raids.
The sect claims a Japanese membership of 20,000. It claims, also, a
Russian connection with 30,000 disciples. The guru, fourth-born son of a
carpet shop owner, visited Moscow often, was sponsored by a leading
university, had a radio show beamed to Japan, and was negotiating the
sale of an arsenal of weaponry from tanks to nuclear arms.
His apocalyptic vision led to aspirations to rule the world. He
acquired arms to create his own Armageddon in 1997. Only his disciples
were to be saved, to emerge as a new world power.
When police took away 50 children from the Kamikuishiki commune, they
were so underfed and filthy that they had to clean them up to tell girls
from boys. They wore hats, like swimming caps, festooned with electrodes
and connected to batteries strapped to their malnourished stomachs.
These were designed to transmit Asahara's brainwaves to the wearers. The
privileged drank his urine, blood and semen in transference of his
powers.
Now, Asahara's aggrieved disciples await their orders from the prison
cell. Suddenly the complacent city that believed itself to be the
world's safest lives in fear of the next atrocity. After the Tokyo
subway gas attack, Japan's police chief was shot in an assassination
bid. The centre of Japan's largest port was twice hit by gas attacks.
Deadly chemicals were sprayed in a railway station in Western Tokyo. A
lavatory at an airport was bombed.
Behind the religious images in the sacred chapel of the commune was
concealed a huge chemical gas plant. Beneath the gas plant was a room
which hid the seven members of the chemicals ministry. Beyond the secret
room was a stainless steel acid tank into which those who attempted to
escape the clutches of the sect were dropped. The layers of danger are
still being unearthed. There have been 200 arrests. No-one can say how
many more are to come.
In Japan, the established certainty of civic authority feels
threatened. Cults are not made, they are born. In Japan they don't yet
know what it is, exactly, they have bred.

THE distancing of home affairs from health is not as radical a move as
it might at first appear, particularly when seen against the long
history of the Scottish Office. The Scottish Home and Health Department
is a post-war development, succeeding the old Home Department, so once
again the services relating directly to the criminal justice system,
including the law, police, prisons and courts, stand autonomously.
This, of course, fits with Labour's avowed policy of creating a
separate criminal justice ministry in Scotland, headed by a justice
minister. In two years they may well find that the groundwork has been
done for them.
The new Home Affairs Department will continue to be headed by Mr
Hamish Hamill who will, following the retirement of the current director
of the Scottish Courts Administration, also become titular head of that
body.
The Scottish Prison Service, already achieving a record of success as
an executive agency, will remain by far the most important part of the
new Home Affairs Department with its chief executive reporting to the
department head. The SPS, with its nothing-to-hide public policy, is a
direct contrast to the Crown Office, but the institutionalised
opaqueness of that organisation seems set to stay unchanged with the
mighty office of Lord Advocate impervious to challenge.
Interestingly, the increasing involvement of social work with
offenders is recognised in bringing this function under the home affairs
wing.
Such functions as the fire service rather sit out by themselves, but
the new home affairs department will include the administration of civil
law and legal aid, the criminal justice lawyers who draft bills and
laws, the parole and life-sentence groups, the central research function
and the central aspect of police administration.

THE reshuffle appears to bring promotion, in all but name, for Mr
Geoff Scaife less than two years after he was brought in as chief
executive of the NHS Management Executive.
Instead of heading one of the divisions under the aegis of the Home
and Health Department's permanent under-secretary, Mr Scaife, 45, a
Cumbrian miner's son who was previously general manager of Mersey
Regional Health Authority, keeps the same title but goes to the top of
the stand-alone Health Department, assuming a wider range of
responsibilities for NHS health policy.
Subordinate divisions within the management executive now flower as
fully fledged divisions of the Health Department, reflecting the
internal market in the National Health Service.
The areas they will cover are NHS trusts, purchasing (in the sense of
purchaser-provider contracts), finance, human resources, corporate
affairs and primary care. Adding these to the traditional chief officer
posts gives the department twelve divisions.
In addition to his major responsibilities in relation to the NHS, the
chief medical officer Dr Howard Kendell will head a Public Health Policy
Unit, dealing with health issues wider than those concerned with NHS
management.
However, Mr Scaife and Dr Kendell are expected to reduce the number of
in-house medical advisers over the next two years, shedding two
principal and two senior MOs, and to use more practising doctors as
part-time medical advisers instead.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish Secretary of the British Medical
Association, yesterday questioned whether a part-timer, employed by one
particular health board or trust, could give truly impartial advice
about the NHS as a whole.
''The whole thing looks like a mushrooming of the administration
needed to make the internal market work,'' he added.

The merging of education and industry into one department will be
welcomed by the local authorities responsible for educating Scotland's
pupils. They have forged closer links with industry and the merger will
be seen as confirmation of developments which have taken place on a
largely ad hoc basis, including:
* Education business partnerships.
* Work placement and work experience programmes for secondary pupils.
* Compact schemes giving pupils job and training guarantees when they
meet targets.
* Enterprise initiatives involving primary and secondary pupils
running their own companies.
* The setting of learning and training targets.
As further evidence of growing collaboration, the Scottish Office
blueprint for upper secondary schooling will bring vocational and
academic education together.
Welcoming the move, Strathclyde region's director of education, Frank
Pignatelli, said: ''Education-industry links have been with us for a
long time and there is general recognition that the education service
has to develop economic growth and prosperity.''
In line with the private sector, which has gone for flatter
structures, there are proposals to do away with one of the two deputy
senior chief inspectors of schools posts and reduce the number of chief
inspectors from 10 to eight.
But they are not likely to affect school inspections since they will
involve streamlining at the top administrative levels. The senior chief
inspector, Nisbet Gallacher, is due to retire next year.
Mr Pignatelli said: ''I am not surprised that the inspectorate is
having to slim down at the senior administrative level. It is
encouraging that the front-line inspection service is being protected.''

ELIZABETH CLARK reports on the efforts being made to ensure the fine
tradition of Scotland's music education system is not dealt the same
hefty blow suffered south of the Border
SCOTLAND has, for many years, possessed a music education system
envied throughout Europe for both its standards and variety. South of
the Border, however, the story is sadly a very different one. With many
schools opting out of government control and those left within the
structure faced with endless cuts in their precious resources, music
education has been dealt a hefty blow.
What, then, should we in Scotland be doing to ensure that our enviable
tradition is maintained and indeed strengthened? This week, a group of
dedicated campaigners is gathering in an East Lothian hotel for the
inaugural conference of the Scottish Music Education Forum.
Initiated by Lothian region music adviser Andy Kerr to address the
potential threats to the current system and the knock-on effects these
threats could have on Scottish musical life, the principal aims of the
forum are fourfold: to maintain and enhance the particular strengths of
music in Scotland; to collate and disseminate information; to identify
and promote good practice; and to reflect and promote the breadth and
diversity of music in Scotland.
Not merely a PR venture for Scottish music teachers, constituent
groups include composers, performers, industry and media representatives
and the wider communities in traditional, jazz, pop and rock music.
Kerr has strong views on the need for such a forum. ''It just seems
such an important time in the development of music-making on all fronts
in Scotland to get people together. There is so much good going on that
we ought to promote. We will promote what Scotland could lose.''
Local government reorganisation stands as the greatest potential
threat to the current system, along with the devolved management of
educational resources and possible cuts in the peripatetic instrumental
service.
Kerr foresees an important role for the forum in facilitating any
necessary changes. ''With the desegregation of regions into smaller
councils, they'll be unaware of the existing potential. One of our
concepts is to make a stab at bringing together the many different types
of music-making going on in Scotland and make the councils aware of
it.''
Another man closely involved in the efforts of the forum is Royal SNO
chief executive Paul Hughes. Specifically responsible for the
involvement of the professional organisation such as his own Royal SNO,
Hughes recognises the benefits of a solid music education system.
''We, the Royal SNO, as a performing arts group, could be seen as the
recipients of the product in terms of players, but also those who don't
come directly into the profession are the audience of tomorrow, so we're
constantly feeding into the system itself.
''If we're not careful, then our present system may eventually
disappear because all the co-ordinating structures are dissolving. The
introduction of devolved educational management means that music is now
being sold to the highest bidder, which usually means those who can
afford it and they're not usually the ones who can benefit from it
most.''
This is exactly what has happened in England where the only children
learning how to play instruments are those whose parents can afford to
pay for the lesson, and so music is becoming an option for a fortunate
minority rather than an equal partner in the educational curriculum.
Kerr hopes that it won't come to that in Scotland. ''There's been a
tremendous attitudinal change in Scotland in the understanding of music
within the education framework. We've seen a seven-times increase in
music exam presentation at Standard Grade and Higher Level in the past
20 years, and our universities are now accepting music as at least of
equal value to what would be considered more academic subjects.''
The evidence is there for the need for a body to co-ordinate a
campaign to maintain the high standards of music education  at present
existing in Scotland. Whether or not the Scottish Music Education Forum
can rise to the challenge remains to be seen, but already their efforts
are making people aware of our precarious system.
Hughes hopes for a good response. ''It's so fundamental to so many
people that we don't quite realise -- anyone in the street who has any
contact with any kind of music whatsoever -- it has to come from
somewhere and it starts in the education system.
''We're banging the drum as much as we can, but we can't force people
to attend. Everyone thinks it's a good idea because no-one's put an open
talking shop together before -- we have to believe that people will come
out of the woodwork and talk.''
* The Scottish Music Education Forum Conference runs from May 17-19 at
the Marine Hotel, North Berwick.

THE girlfriend of a teenager who hanged himself in a police cell is
suing the Chief Constable of Fife for #35,000 in damages.
Miss Mary Stewart is seeking #20,000 for herself and a further #15,000
for the son Colin Davidson never lived to see.
Mr Davidson, 19, was found hanging from a noose made from a blanket on
April 24, 1989, shortly before he was due to appear in court.
He was pronounced dead at hospital the same day, after suffering brain
damage caused by the hanging.
Miss Stewart, of Green Street, Dunfermline, Fife, and the dead man's
mother, Mrs Helen Davidson, claim he should have been kept on a suicide
watch in the cells.
Mrs Davidson, 57, of Wedderburn Crescent, Dunfermline, is also suing
Chief Constable William Moodie for #10,000, in the action before a civil
jury at the Court of Session.
They claim that Mr Davidson had made previous suicide attempts while
in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, and at Polmont Young Offenders'
Institution.
His family claims the officer should have reported it to his superiors
and Mr Davidson should have been put on constant suicide watch or
transferred to another police station with special observation cells.
Mr Davidson was arrested at his mother's former home by Constable
Anthony Fitzpatrick and another officer and taken to Dunfermline police
station.
The policeman, now a sergeant, told the court yesterday that, about
two years prior to the incident, Mr Davidson had told him in a
conversation that he could understand why prisoners hanged themselves.
''He said it was something he would consider because he could not cope
with a prison sentence,'' the officer said.
He had heard through the grapevine that the youth had made a suicide
attempt while detained previously.
Sergeant Fitzpatrick said that Mr Davidson had spoken to him in the
early hours of Sunday morning.
Mr Fitzpatrick said: ''He made a comment, 'If I go to prison, I won't
be coming out again' or words to that effect.''
The policeman asked him what he meant by the remark and Mr Davidson
replied: ''I will top myself.''
Mrs Davidson said her son was ''over the moon'' when he had discovered
he was going to be a father and was talking about getting married after
the baby was born.
Fife police have denied that the death of Mr Davidson was caused by
the fault and negligence of their officer.
The hearing, before Lord Hamilton, continues.

SIR John Mills, the veteran actor and Oscar winner, is to be honoured
with a lifetime achievement award from the Scottish committee of the
Variety Club of Great Britain.
The award will be presented to him at a special gala dinner in Glasgow
on September 9. It follows a similar event, organised jointly by the
Variety Club and the Rothesay Winter Gardens Appeal, last year at which
tribute was paid to actor and director Lord Richard Attenborough.
Scottish committee member, Mr Robbie Glen, explained yesterday: ''Last
year's dinner was so successful that we have decided to make it an
annual event. We are now in the throes of organising it and lining up
speakers. Amongst the speakers last year were Sir Anthony Hopkins, Barry
Norman, Johnnie Beattie, and, of course, Lord Attenborough. It will once
again be one of the most prestigious events of the year for Glasgow.''
The new award, which will be known as the Attenborough-Winter Gardens
Award, will be presented annually to a person who has made an
outstanding contribution to his or her particular field. Lord
Attenborough, who has a holiday home in the Rothesay area, is a patron
of the Winter Gardens.

HIGH Court judges were told yesterday they did not have the power to
interfere with the decision to ban homosexuals from military service.
It was a matter which should be left to those ''who have both the
military and political responsibility for the armed forces'', said Mr
Stephen Richards, appearing for the Ministry of Defence.
''This is not an area into which the courts should venture.''
Mr Richards was speaking on the second day of a landmark test case in
which three sacked servicemen and one woman are asking Lord Justice
Simon Brown and Mr Justice Curtis to rule the automatic bar ''perverse
and irrational'' and in breach of both European and domestic law.
The four are former Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from
London; former RAF Sergeant Graeme Grady, 32, from London; former RAF
nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from Edinburgh; and former Royal Navy weapons
engineer John Beckett, 25, from Sheffield.
They want the ban lifted so they can resume their careers.
Mr Richards told the judges the case concerned the exercise of
prerogative powers involving matters connected with the defence of the
realm and, in such cases, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain an
application for judicial review.
The Government's decision to ban homosexuals was based on the advice
of the armed forces and derived from ''a practical assessment of the
implications of homosexual orientation on military life and the
efficient operation of the armed forces''.
Mr Richards said: ''The matter is properly left to the supervision of
Parliament, which indeed your lordships have heard is due to examine the
Armed Forces Bill within the course of the next year and will be free to
examine this topic further if it thinks fit.''
Earlier, Mr David Pannick QC, for three of the applicants, told the
court that the ''outrageous'' ban had led to a ''sheer waste of ability
and potential'' and caused human misery for no good reason.
The sacking of people just because they were homosexual amounted to a
breach of their ''fundamental human right to a private life free from
intrusion''.
There was no evidence to support the fears of the military authorities
that the ''mere presence'' of gays and lesbians in the services would
cause ''disruption, problems about lavatories and parents not wanting
children to come into the armed forces, or problems about security''.
Ms Laura Cox QC, appearing for Mr Grady, said he described the
investigation by the military authorities as ''one of the most degrading
things he had ever encountered''.
However, Mr Richards said Government policy for the recruitment and
dismissal of servicemen and women came back to the ''organisation,
armament, and maintenance of the armed forces'' and it fell
''classically within the prerogative powers'' concerned with the defence
of the realm.
He said courts were ''ill-adapted to provide the right answer''.
The hearing continues.

PAST experience does not bode well for Ark2, the new #8m Christian
cable TV network planned for Britain. Some years ago, a God-fearing
American publisher launched a daily newspaper which reported only good
news stories. It lasted about a month.
Still, as a man from the amen (last word) in God-slot broadcasting
ventures asked rhetorically at its launch yesterday: ''Why should the
Devil have all the best channels?'' And why indeed. At least it will be
the only station in Britain where a 9pm watershed will be an unnecessary
evil.
Ark2, named after Noah's boat, needs to raise #1m to get on the air by
the target date of next April. Without the money, well, it doesn't have
a prayer.
The station, due to broadcast nationwide from Bristol, has already
lined up some its presenters. If God truly is on the side, not of the
big battalions, but of those who fire the best shots, then Auberon Waugh
(who will host a political show), radio presenter Libby Purvis (a
topical debate programme), and Scottish broadcaster Sally Magnusson (her
role as unspecified), will be well advised to seek some early practice
on the rifle range.
The viewing schedule, on the face of it at least, sounds decidedly
racy for a religion-based station with a late-night line-up which
features rap and rock music programmes. During the day and early
evening, there will be a mix of sport (champion hurdler Kriss Akabusi is
discussing terms), drama (The Saint?), entertainment, children's
programmes, and current affairs.
What Ark2 promises not to be, mercifully for the viewing population,
is anything like the insidious American Bible-thumping evangelical
networks.
''The one thing we want to avoid is a televangelist station,'' said
programme director Mr Alan Rogers. ''All the research shows it is the
last thing the British public wants. They don't want people preaching to
them or appealing for money on air all the time.
''We won't be like American stations saying 'Send me a 10-dollar bill
and you will be blessed'. It's wrong and it's totally inappropriate in
Britain. We wouldn't be averse to converting people but our broader aim
is to get them to think about and discuss moral issues.''
The plan for the new religion-based station comes at a time when
conventional channels are increasingly giving short shrift to the
pastoral and the spiritual. Late Call has gone, Songs of Praise is but a
pale shadow of its former self, and even Harry Secombe is seldom
featured on the box these days. Indeed, the ITC has criticised several
commercial stations for ignoring its responsibility to cover religion.
The fact is that Britain is a much more secular -- and much less
Christian -- country than it once was. In this Godless age, religious
broadcasting doesn't attract viewers.
However, Mr Rogers says that Ark2's research has shown that 71% of the
UK population believed in God but that only 15% go to church.
''There's a huge gap -- more than half the population believe in
something beyond themselves but find organised religion unappealing.
That's who we hope to reach. We will also be making a strong appeal to
young people, because cable viewing is a young person's area.''
Ark2, which will be interdenominational, is being launched by three
charitable trusts, with the Bristol-based Templar Trust as the main
driving force. The other two are the Housetop Trust, based in London,
and the Gorman Trust, in Bath. It will be funded by programme
sponsorship, donations, and advertising.
Sponsorship deals will probably be the key to the station's success or
failure in producing original programmes, which Ark2 says will reflect
the station's moral outlook but will not necessarily be overtly
Christian.
''There are quite a lot of large companies who want to be associated
with strong moral beliefs. It is not a goodie-goodie station but it is a
good station for companies who stand for a certain set of values,''
added Mr Rogers.

SENIOR Glasgow councillor Pat Lally has been elected planning
spokesman for the new ''shadow'' City of Glasgow Council.
His was the only nomination to be challenged at yesterday's meeting of
the ruling Labour Group at which several other spokesmen were appointed.
He defeated Councillor Ron Davey by 43-24, including a Labour
executive block vote of 16.
The other spokesmen appointed were: education, Dr Malcolm Green
(region); personnel, Mr William O'Rourke (region); finance, Mr Eamon
Fitzgerald (district); parks and recreation, Mr James Mutter (district);
economic and industrial development, Mrs Susan Baird (district); social
strategy, Mr Archie Simpson (district); social work, Mrs Mary Beckett
(region); housing, joint conveners Mr James McCarron and Mr Craig
Roberton (both district); roads, Mr Charles Gordon (region); arts and
culture, Mr Frank McAveety (district).
It is expected the committee structure of the new council will be
announced by the end of June.
Councillor Robert Gould, Labour leader of the new ''shadow'' city
authority, said: ''Everything went first class -- all in harmony. I was
surprised myself.''
On the issue of the new headquarters for the unified council, he
added: ''The City Chambers will remain the main seat of power for the
present time. Until that issue comes forward as an item on the agenda,
then everything else is speculation.''
He pointed out that a joint working party of the regional and district
council had, prior to the election, recommended that the City Chambers
should be the headquarters of the new authority.

UNREST among members of Queens Park Football Club surfaced at the
club's annual meeting on Monday night when long-standing committee
member and past-president Bert Cromar failed in a bid to be re-elected
to the committee.
Mr Cromar, who is a former joint general manager of the Bank of
Scotland, was seen as one of the establishment figures at the club and
his unsuccessful attempt to retain his seat after 30 years on the
committee will be seen as a victory for the growing number of members
dissatisfied with certain aspects of the running of the club.
The club's members voted in a ballot after nine people were nominated
for the eight committee places.
Mr Ian Harnett, who had also served on the committee for many years,
had earlier decided not to stand for re-election and the two new members
of the committee voted on by the members were Mr Andrew McGlennan, who
is assistant club coach, and Mr Kenneth Harvey, a former referee who has
been a club member for several years.
It was an open secret at the meeting that most of the members who
supported Mr Harvey were those who had been advocating change at the
club.
Sources at the club have said his success in the ballot should be a
clear indication that the members' views in connection with the running
of the club should be more carefully considered in future.
Following unrest among members earlier this season, a number of
significant changes have taken place at the club.
In December, club coach Eddie Hunter had his employment terminated
after 16 years in the position, the rules regarding the playing of
ex-professionals were relaxed, and women members were admitted for the
first time.
The spokesman added that it was hoped these changes would result in
greater success for the club and trusted that further progress could be
made. He said that his group was unhappy at earlier being described as
rebels.
Mr Cromar, a former player who first appeared for Queens Park in 1950
and continued his playing career until 1963, stands fourth in the list
of players with first-team appearances, with a total of 486. He was not
available for comment yesterday.
Mr Alistair MacKay, club secretary, yesterday declined to speculate on
why Mr Cromar's bid for re-election failed.
Queens Park is about to start the final stage of the redevelopment of
Hampden Park with the demolition of the existing south stand and the
construction of a #15m all-seater stand for 17,500 people which would
take the total capacity to 52,000.

THE FACT that few members of the upper crust can afford to live in the
splendour to which they were once accustomed can bring some crumbs of
comfort for the rest of us. Specialist developers are restoring some of
Scotland's grand houses and turning them into places where us ''below
stairs'' types can afford to live. As a result, fine old buildings are
saved, while the ramparts of privilege are demolished by market forces.
Dalzell House on the outskirts of Motherwell is an outstanding example
of a grand Scottish house which had gone into steep decline. During the
Eighties it was restored and redeveloped by Classical House, the
developers who specialise in the restoration of outstanding old
buildings. The Greek Thomson town house on Glasgow's Great Western
Terrace and the Italian Centre on John Street are two of their triumphs.
Now a three bedroom flat in the Glencairn Wing at Dalzell house has
been put on the market. The ground floor conversion within the A-listed
building has a large lounge and dining room, and three bedrooms (one
en-suite).
The lounge has a vaulted ceiling and retains its original fireplace.
The main bedroom has three windows opening onto the main courtyard. All
owners at Dalzell house share in the landscaped gardens, which are set
out in terraces.
Local historian Jack Sloan says that an earlier project to restore and
extend Dalzell House was launched in 1857, under the direction of
architect William Billings who had worked on the restorations of both
Edinburgh and Stirling castles and was a noted antiquarian.
His work on Dalzell House is reckoned to be his masterpiece. The house
stands above a waterfall on the Dalzell burn - a site which has been
occupied for more than 1000 years, and by the Dalzell family since the
tenth century.
Close to the house stands an oak tree which is over 800 years old.
Like the tree, the impressive splendour of Dalzell House has changed and
developed over the centuries.
The keep at the centre of the house was built in 1450 as a defensive
dwelling. Its walls were 8ft thick and the entrance, which was at
first-floor level, was reached by removable stairs. Later additions
included a moat and an enclosing courtyard wall.
Meanwhile, the owners plunged enthusiastically into agricultural
improvements and Jack Sloan says that there are records of apricot trees
going as far back as 1722. Orchards containing 200 different types of
tree were planted in long avenues running down to the Clyde.
By the time Billings was asked to carry out his nineteenth-century
improvements, the house had been greatly extended down through the
generations. Billings carried out further extensions, sometimes copying
styles from other important Scottish castles.
The result combines the ancient with the Victorian in a splendid mix
of turrets, towers, gables, terraces, walls and arches.
Anyone who fancies buying into a building which trace its roots back
for 1000 years should contact Glasgow estate agency Euan Wallace. Offers
over #119,500 are sought for the ground floor conversion.

WHY do some houses sell faster than others? There is nothing more
frustrating for a would-be seller than to see a similar house up the
road sell within a a couple of weeks, while theirs languishes on the
market for months.
Glasgow's estate agents have the job of marketing houses in good times
and in bad, and they have some trenchant advice for sellers in the
current patchy market.
Bill Cullens of Clyde Property has a very simple suggestion for those
who want to impress viewers who come to their house: ''Clean it! And get
rid of the dug until you've sold the place. If you can show people that
you are house-proud they will tend to have more confidence that you have
looked after the place properly.''
For an estate agent, Bill Cullens is on the quiet side, preferring the
soft approach to the hard sell. ''Be glad that people have come to view
your home, but don't try to sell to them. Welcome them in, show them
anything they want to see, answer any of their questions, then let them
wander around by themselves.
''You've got to remember that people are nervous about coming into
your home, and they are nervous about you coming on too strong with the
sell.''
Although he in favour of kenneling the dog for the duration, Bill
Cullens takes a softer line with children. ''If you are selling a family
home there is nothing wrong with having toys scattered around the place.
Show people that you are a happy family!''
And there is no need to pull your teenage daughter's pop posters off
the wall. ''Kids visiting with their parents will be able to imagine
themselves in that room. That's important.''
Presentation and pricing are the keys to a quick exchange, according
to Colvil Johnston of Slater Hogg &amp; Howison. ''If there is a bad facet
to your home, then it will put people off, even if the rest of the place
is in good condition.'' But that does not mean that sellers have to
redecorate the whole house.
''If one of the bedrooms is rather gloomy, then it will be worth
giving it a coat of paint. But sellers have to remember that they won't
get the cost of decoration back in the selling price - it's really about
minimum outlay for maximum effect.''
Colvil Johnston says that some of the old tricks - such as the smell
of coffee percolating through the house, or a little almond oil in the
oven - really do help to give a pleasant atmosphere.
''After viewers have gone round the house, invite them back into the
best room. It might be the lounge, or it might be the kitchen. But it is
worth leaving them with a strong picture of the very best selling
point,'' he says.
If the price is right, then the house will sell faster. Slater Hogg &amp;
Howison's sales figures indicate that a new sense of reality about
pricing has penetrated the market. ''It's paramount that the price is
right. In areas where prices are too high, such as parts of England and
in Edinburgh, you get a log-jam.''
While Colvil Johnston believes that there is a realism in the West of
Scotland, he has noticed that people who live in the country areas tend
to be more realistic.
''There is a kind of city-greed factor where people who bought for
#90,000 a couple of years ago are determined to get more than that price
now. We should think of property in the same way that we think of shares
- prices can fall as well as rise.
''It's all pro rata. If selling prices are down by 5% then so are
purchase prices.''
Andy Goodearl of estate agents Euan Wallace takes a similarly robust
view of the national obsession with house prices.
''Too many people worry about whether prices are going up or down. If
you are buying and selling in the same market, then you have to remember
that if you don't get quite as much as you would have liked for your own
house, you'll be paying a little less for your next home.''
Roy Slater cautions against believing your friends and neighbours when
they make extravagant claims about the price their house fetched. ''This
is a serious business and sellers could lose a lot of money if they get
the marketing wrong.
''We have got to get back to basics, which means ignoring the rumours
in the market and using the experience of a good estate agent.'' He
recommends that sellers should shop around, checking with other recent
sellers as to which estate agent did a good job for them.
''Estate agency is an extremely competitive market at the moment, and
sellers should chose very carefully.''
Steve Hamilton of SEAL says that the art of selling your house is to
ensure that it is in showroom condition. ''If the house is looking good
and the garden is neat and tidy, then you are off to a flying start.
''You also need to set a realistic price and use the services of a
professional estate agency to ensure that any inquiries are followed up
by agents who know the West of Scotland market. If you want to maximise
the sales potential of your home, it is absolutely vital to use people
who know what they are talking about.''
George Storrie of the Robb Agency says that the attitude of sellers
can sometimes be a major hindrance to the marketing process. ''I had one
recent client who was extremely anxious to sell his home quickly and
demanded that we send plenty of viewers around.
''So we were rather surprised when he burst in to our local branch to
complain that we had put a picture of his house in our office window.
''I don't want people to know I'm selling!' he told us - which makes
marketing rather difficult...''
George Storrie believes that the ''offers over'' system, the
traditional way of selling property in Scotland, offers the fastest way
to sell in the current market.
''If someone's house is worth #100,000, I'd put it on the market at
offers over #79,000. I'd advertise it heavily in The Herald and in our
own publications. Then, quite quickly, you would corner the market in
people who were interested in that type of house in that sort of
location - and the price will start to rise towards that #100,000.
Selling in a patchy market comes down to three Ps - price,
presentation and professional marketing.

LOCAL legend in Aberfoyle has it that when Rob Roy MacGregor was
feeling drouthy after hard day's cattle reiving, he'd pop into Jean
MacAlpine's Inn at Milton for a quick one. No drink is served at the inn
nowadays, but those with a thirst for Scottish history can buy into the
spirit of Rob Roy's Trossachs stamping grounds.
A cottage currently on the market offers the secluded charm of a small
hamlet combined with the thatched stone building which served as Jean's
Inn.
Milton is about a mile west of Aberfoyle on the road to Loch Ard.
Milton Farm Cottage is a traditional stone property which was
comprehensively renovated about ten years ago.
The accommodation includes sitting room and dining area, a farmhouse
kitchen, three bedrooms (one with en-suite facilities), a large floored
loft with the potential for conversion, and just under two acres of
garden and grounds.
Behind the cottage stands Jean's Inn, a thatched stone building which
dates back to around 1600 and which features in Sir Walter Scott's Rob
Roy.
The agents say that the sellers have ''fastidiously'' restored the
building so that it now resembles its original construction. Although it
is not yet habitable, it could be fully restored and has potential as a
tourist attraction.
Rob Roy MacGregor (1671 to 1734) has strong connections with the area
and was born nearby on the shores of Loch Katrine. His wife, Mary
Campbell, came from Comer, a few miles up the road from Milton.
He earned a handy income running a protection racket in the Lowlands,
later acquiring land at Craigroyston and at Inversnaid, the hamlet on
the east shore of Loch Lomond which is at the end of the road which
wends its way past Milton.
Rob Roy was outlawed in 1712 and his family evicted from Craigroyston.
Many of his cattle raids into the Lowlands were launched from his
strongholds in the jagged countryside around Aberfoyle.
Nowadays, the district is much more peaceful. Surrounded by the Queen
Elizabeth Forest Park, Milton is offers a wide range of leisure
activities including walking, angling, sailing, bird-watching,
mountain-biking, and boating.
Clyde Property is quoting offers over #110,000 for Milton Farm Cottage
and #40,000 for Jean MacAlpine's Inn.

TWO separate investigations began yesterday into why a #30m Nimrod
surveillance aircraft ditched in flames in the Moray Firth.
The aircraft was only half an hour into a test flight, its first
following six months of major servicing and maintenance at RAF Kinloss,
when the seven-man crew was forced to ditch in the sea because of
serious engine fires.
Eyewitnesses reported seeing flames trailing from its starboard
engines within minutes of it taking off from Kinloss.
There were immediate fears for the lives of the seven crew members but
the Nimrod's captain, Flight Lieutenant Art Stacey, made a controlled
landing in the sea, ensuring that the crew members could be winched off
by helicopter without serious injury.
Two investigations were launched by an RAF board of inquiry and the
Air Accident Investigation Branch of the Civil Aviation Authority.
There was great praise for the captain's skill, which allowed what was
described as a textbook rescue. Kinloss Squadron Leader John Horrocks
said: ''I think he did exceptionally well getting it down in one piece.
It was a fine piece of aircraft handling.''
Group Captain Bob Joseph, the base's commanding officer, said they had
been fortunate such an experienced pilot had been in charge and that the
sea had been like a millpond.
He had visited Flt Lt Stacey at Gray's Hopital in Elgin, where he and
another crew member had been taken because they had been complaining of
back pains.
''They are perfectly all right. Flt Lt Stacey did an outstanding job
today, without a shadow of a doubt, to save the lives of his crew. He is
in good shape, laughing and joking, and the rest of the crew are
similarly in good shape.''
The RAF categorically denied reports suggesting that there had been a
fire on the same aircraft earlier in the week.
The Nimrod, from 51st Squadron RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, is
understood to be one of only three specifically designed for electronic
eavesdropping.
Its electronic equipment had been removed before going to Kinloss for
servicing but its specially modified airframe will be a serious loss to
the RAF.
Group Captain Joseph said he did not talk to the pilot in detail about
what had happened but he understood that Flt Lt Stacey had been trying
to come back to RAF Lossiemouth for an emergency landing.
The Nimrod had taken off at 10.53am on what was planned to be a three
or four-hour test flight. At 11.22, the crew sent a distress signal and
at 11.26, had completed a controlled landing at sea, three miles north
of Lossiemouth.
A Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, which was already airborne
in the area and knew of the Nimrod's difficulties, arrived on the scene
at 11.32 and all seven crew were winched to safety. Buckie and
Invergordon lifeboats had also been launched.
The helicopter pilot spoke of his horror as he watched the burning
aircraft plunge into the sea after hearing the calm voice of the pilot
give the chilling standard final call of an aircraft in trouble over the
sea: ''Ditching, ditching, ditching.''
Squadron Leader Bob Somerville was on a training exercise over the
Moray Firth when air traffic control alerted him of the distress signal
from the aircraft.
He said: ''The Nimrod was 13 miles north-east of Lossiemouth and I was
about 20 miles west of the Nimrod. The Nimrod pilot said he was
diverting to Lossiemouth and I adjusted my course to head for there as
well. It took me five minutes to get him in sight and we were flying
roughly towards each other.
''I was about three miles away and I could see the flames streaming
from the aircraft. There was quite a glow. The pilot then gave the
standard ditching call.
''He was very cool and calm and obviously in control of his aircraft.
I saw it plunge into the water at about 145mph, landing tail first. It
was a remarkable piece of flying by him. I was alongside in two
minutes.''
He added: ''The aircraft was floating nicely on the surface, and the
crew were already in their survival dinghy. They paddled away from the
aircraft and we picked them up. They didn't say much, just that they
were relieved that they were safe. Two of them had minor back injuries
and, after dropping the other five at Lossiemouth, I took them to
hospital in Elgin.''
His winchman, Sergeant Nick Lambert, suffered burns to his hands after
being splashed by burning fuel.
Mr Robert Newlands, an offshore worker who saw the aircraft coming
down from his home in Lossiemouth and viewed the drama through his
telescope, said: ''Flames seemed to be coming out of the wing and then
it just landed on the water. They obviously knew what they were doing
when they landed it.
''There was a helicopter there almost straight away, a grey Sea King,
followed shortly afterwards by a yellow Sea King. People came out the
top and liferafts were launched. They were off in minutes.
''The plane stayed afloat for about 10 minutes and then just went
down.''
Squadron Leader Horrocks said he was aware that there was an
eyewitness account which suggested the two starboard engines had gone on
fire but he could not confirm it. He said it was possible to fly a
Nimrod on just two engines in one wing but that would depend on the
other damage suffered.
The Nimrod weighed between 50 and 60 tonnes and he estimated it was
now lying in about 100ft of water. Every effort would now be made to
salvage the aircraft.
* A crewman on a naval reserve buoytender was killed yesterday in an
accident off South Uist in the Western Isles.
It is understood the civilian crewman was crushed between two massive
metal buoys on the deck of the Royal Maritime Auxilliary Service vessel,
the Salmaster.
The coastguard helicopter, based at Stornoway on Lewis, was scrambled.
The helicopter picked up a doctor at Benbecula on the way. He was
lowered on to the vessel with the winchman.
The 150ft vessel, which services buoys and other navigation markers,
was at Loch Carnan, north-west of South Uist.
The crewman was pronounced dead immediately. He had been found by his
crewmates crushed between the heavy metal buoys which are more than 12ft
high.
The helicopter took the body to Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway.
Police from Benbecula last night were making arrangements to go to the
Salmaster, which was still at anchor in Loch Carnan, to interview the
crew.
A Royal Navy spokesman said no statement would be made until the dead
man's relatives had been informed.

Washington, Tuesday,
THINGS are getting difficult for O J Simpson. The prosecution has
finally reached the bloodstains, in its long and tedious exposition of
the case, and now claims it has absolute scientific proof of the
football star's guilt.
Dr Robin Cotton, who directs the DNA lab that analysed the
bloodstains, says that Simpson's blood was found at the scene of the
crime, and that the blood of the two victims, Nicole Simpson and Ron
Goldman, was found in Simpson's car and at his house.
She did not, of course, say that this proved his guilt. That was not
her job. The prosecution can be relied on to spell out to the jury, in
case anyone missed the point, that there is only one way the various
bloodstains could have occurred: Simpson murdered his ex-wife and her
friend by slashing them with a knife.
In the process, he cut his hand, and left drops of his own blood
behind him -- and brought traces of his victims' blood with him as he
escaped by car to his house.
The single most damaging piece of evidence so far was a bloodstain
found on one of a pair of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom. It was
Nicole Simpson's blood. DNA testing, a relatively recent but very
powerful scientific tool, proved the point beyond doubt, according to Dr
Cotton.
The prosecution has yet to ask her about bloodstains on the glove
found at Simpson's house. It is the second glove of a pair: the first
was left next to the bodies.
The presentation of the evidence has been dry and repetitive, but Dr
Cotton has proved a formidable witness. She is highly competent,
unflappable and persuasive. She says that there is a 150 million to one
chance that the blood found on Simpson's car did not come from Nicole
Simpson, and six billion to one chance that the blood on the sock was
not hers.
The defence has now sent its team in to interrogate her: she has been
on the stand for over a week and the end is not in sight.
But the defence strategy is clear enough: cast doubt on the
statistics, and if that does not work, suggest that the police got all
the evidence confused.
Its last hope is to claim that the whole thing is an elaborate plot by
racist police to pin the guilt on an innocent man. That would be, on the
face of it, a difficult case to argue.
It would mean that the people who took Simpson's blood samples a few
days after the murders then carried drops of it over to the murder scene
and sprinkled it around where their colleagues would find it. Then they
obtained samples of Mrs Simpson's and Goldman's blood, and sprinkled it
on the defendant's car and in his house, and on his socks.
Simpson has a huge team of lawyers which will try anything to persuade
at least one juror that the case is unproved, or that he is victim of a
plot. The blood evidence is the most difficult of all to explain away.
Earlier witnesses described various aspects of the night of the
murder, but none saw Simpson slit his ex-wife's throat, and the defence
spent days attacking the credibility of police witnesses, suggesting
that they were incompetent, racist or both.
Blood is different, and DNA analysis is science and all the lawyers
and experts are going to have a hard time explaining it away.

Cairo, Tuesday,
A VAST 3000-year-old royal tomb uncovered in Egypt's Valley of the
Kings should throw new light on the family of one of the ancient world's
most colourful and powerful rulers, archaeologists said today.
The tomb, explored by a team of American archaeologists earlier this
year, is believed to have housed the mummified corpses of up to 50 sons
of the military pharaoh Ramses II.
Egyptian authorities announced yesterday that 67 chambers have so far
been discovered in the underground tomb, and archaeologists say it may
be the biggest found in Egypt.
Ramses ruled ancient Egypt for 67 years in the 13th century BC, waging
war on his enemies and peppering the countryside with monuments
perpetuating his glory.
But virtually nothing is known about his offspring.
''We know their names, but that is about all,'' said Kent Weeks, who
led the excavations at the tomb, known as KV 5.
Archaeologists had previously discovered the tombs of just two of the
52 sons Ramses is believed to have fathered.
''We knew nothing of the remaining 50 sons until the rediscovery of KV
5,'' Weeks said in a written statement.
The entrance to the tomb was discovered last century in the rugged
limestone walls of the valley, just 30 yards from the tomb of Ramses II
himself, but floodwater debris had blocked off all but three of the
outermost chambers and the entrance itself later became blocked up and
eventually hidden.
Weeks's team, working from the diaries of 19th century travellers to
the Valley of the Kings, rediscovered the entrance and in February found
a passageway leading past 20 chambers to a statue of Osiris, god of the
underworld.
The corridor then divided into two more passages, each with 20 rooms,
which end in stairs and a sloping corridor which could lead to dozens of
more chambers, Weeks's statement said
None of the rooms so far discovered is less than three yards by three
yards.
Most tombs in the valley, where the mummy of young pharaoh Tutankhamun
was discovered in 1922 amid fabulous treasures, comprise just one
corridor leading to a handful of rooms.
''What makes KV 5 important is that it is a multiple burial of many
royal children, a tomb of unique plan and large size, and a tomb whose
decoration and artefacts promise to provide information about Egypt's
royal family at a crucial time in Egypt's history,'' Weeks said.
''The tomb also raises many questions about what else the Valley of
the Kings and other areas at (the pharaonic capital of) Thebes may have
to offer,'' he added.
The tomb itself, described as magnificent by the head of Egypt's
antiquities department, is nevertheless in poor condition and has been
badly looted by ancient grave robbers.
But excavators have found fragments of mummified bodies, statues,
jewellery, furniture and food offerings inside the chambers, and some of
the walls still bear ancient decorations.
Hieroglyphic names of at least four of Ramses's sons were found in the
tomb, including his eldest son Amun-Her-Khepeshef.
Some historians believe Ramses II was pharaoh during the exodus of
Israelites from Egypt recorded in the Bible.
In that case Amun-Her-Khepeshef, along with first-born chidren
throughout Egypt, may have suffered the unfortunate fate of death by
heavenly command.
''And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon the throne, even unto the
firstborn of the maidservant,'' the biblical book of Exodus
says.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Tuesday,
THE United Nations today rejected a Bosnian plea for Nato air strikes
on Serbs surrounding Sarajevo and blamed government troops for starting
the worst fighting for months.
The rebuff came at a meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris
Silajdzic and Major-General Herve Gobilliard, the top UN officer in the
city, as mortar, machinegun and small arms fire reverberated outside.
The fighting, described as the most serious for two years, sent
civilians scurrying into basement shelters for the first time since the
start of a four-month ceasefire that ended on May 1.
''This hell is starting again, I can't stand it,'' said a 23-year-old
woman as she cowered in the doorway of a shuttered shop.
Fighting continued into the afternoon with explosions every minute. UN
officials said up to 20 heavy weapons, most of them manned by the Serbs,
were being fired from a so-called ''exclusion zone'' around the city
which is supposed to be free of such arms.
Serbs were even firing a large-calibre mortar from inside one UN
weapons collection point.
A 12-year-old girl was killed and her 17-year-old brother critically
wounded when they were hit by shrapnel and a 23-year-old French
peacekeeper shot in the head by a sniper on Thursday died today. He was
the 37th French soldier killed in Bosnia and Croatia since 1992.
Although government forces appeared to have started the fighting,
peacekeepers said ''both parties are equally to blame''.
UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said: ''Once again it is the civilians
who become the ultimate victims of this tragic war. They should not be
put through another harrowing day of seeing shrapnel and bullets tear
people apart.''
The fighting appeared to have been concentrated on two Bosnian Serb
supply routes skirting the hills above the city, one linking the Serbs'
''capital'' in Pale with their main military base at Lukavica and the
other leading to the Serb suburb of Vogosca.

Washington, Tuesday
IS the body buried in a Baltimore grave for 130 years really that of
John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, or an
imposter?
A judge will hear arguments tomorrow on whether the remains under the
Booth family obelisk in Green Mount Cemetery should be dug up and
examined by scientists to determine if it was really Booth.
Historians and Booth descendants have lined up on both sides in the
court case. Three women who signed a petition to the court to dig up the
remains claim to be related to Booth through a woman with whom he
allegedly fathered a child a year after he was said to have been killed.
The traditional version of events has Booth, an actor who despised
Lincoln and sympathised with the South in the American Civil War,
sneaking into the presidential box and firing a shot into Lincoln's head
during a performance on Good Friday, 1865, at Washington's Ford Theatre.
Booth then leapt onto the stage, ran out the door and escaped into the
night, aided by conspirators. Twelve days later, Northern troops shot
and killed a man identified as Booth when he refused to surrender at
Bowling Green, Virginia, south of Washington.
But the barn where he was hiding burned to the ground, making positive
identification of the body impossible at the time, and from the start
there were rumours that Booth got away. Over time, a legend has grown up
that has him running off to live another 38 years before killing himself
in 1903 in Enid, Oklahoma.
To help settle the dispute, some relatives of Booth, the Smithsonian
Institution, researchers and several public officials want to exhume the
remains in Baltimore.--Reuter.

Kinshasa, Tuesday
A NURSE from Zaire's Ebola virus zone who slipped out of quarantine in
Kinshasa and disappeared among the capital's five million people has
been found, health officials said today .
The officials told a daily news briefing that 86 of the 93 people
reported with the deadly and incurable disease had now died. No cases
have been reported in the capital Kinshasa.
Outside the sprawling central African country, more governments
started screening or monitoring passengers arriving from Zaire or
elsewhere in Africa to ensure they were not carrying what is one of the
most lethal diseases known to man.
''We have just found where she is,'' Bompenda Bonkumo, head of a
national committee tracking the progress of the disease, said of the
nurse. Officials had the necessary equipment to find out whether she had
the disease, he said. ''We will be able to advise on her state of health
tomorrow.''
A riverboat captain, also placed in isolation in Kinshasa after
arriving from Kikwit, had been given a clean bill of health, health
officials said.
A statement from the committee said that 93 cases had been registered
by today, of whom 72 had died in hospital and 14 outside hospital. Most
cases were in the town of Kikwit, 310 miles from Kinshasa.
Diplomats said the ambassadors of Belgium and the United States were
due to visit Kikwit tomorrow with the Zairean health minister.
Kinshasa governor Bernadin Mungul Diaka said earlier the nurse had
absconded from the university health centre.
The virus, for which there is no vaccine or cure, is spread through
contact with blood or bodily fluids and kills by causing uncontrollable
bleeding.
Authorities in Kinshasa have tightened roadblocks on highways from the
outbreak zone and issued leaflets and graphic posters telling members of
the public not to touch corpses or open wounds.
The committee tracking the epidemic -- which broke out in Kikwit in
April and has spread to at least four neigbouring towns -- had asked for
quarantine for 25 foreign journalists who visited Kikwit on Sunday but
no action has so far been taken.
Countries as far away as the Philippines, Turkey, the United Arab
Emirates and Yemen started monitoring certain plane passengers,
following steps taken by Egypt and Zaire's former colonial ruler
Belgium.
Angola partly closed the border with its northern oil-rich Cabinda
enclave. Other neighbours, Sudan and the Central African Republic
tightened border checks and South Africa began monitoring travellers
from Zaire.
In a sign of hope, the World Health Organisation said four victims in
Kikwit were convalescing and one, a doctor, had recovered and left
hospital.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Tuesday
JAPANESE joy over the arrest of the ''gas guru'' accused of unleashing
killer sarin fumes on the Tokyo underground was abruptly shattered today
by a parcel bomb sent to the city's governor.
The blast, only hours after the doomsday cult leader was seized in a
dramatic police raid on his hideaway, tore off the left hand of one of
the governor's aides as he opened the parcel.
Despite the capture of Shoko Asahara, founder of Aum Shinri Kyo
(Supreme Truth) sect, the bomb starkly reminded Japanese their year of
living dangerously was far from over.
Government leaders, including Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, drove
home the message with reminders that many wanted cult members were still
at large and police were not even sure they had pinpointed all its
caches of lethal chemical weapons.
Several hours after Murayama's advice for the public to stay alert the
parcel bomb exploded in the office of Tokyo's governor Yukio Aoshima at
city hall.
The governor, elected only last month, was not in the room at the
time.
Police refused to comment on whether the bomb was linked to the guru's
arrest. But earlier today the governor vowed to disband the mysterious
cult if its leader Asahara is charged over the killing of 12 people and
the wounding of another 5000 in the sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo
underground on March 20.
Police capped an eight-week invesitagtion of the cult with their
arrest in the early hours of 40-year-old Asahara as he meditated alone
in a secret bedroom at Aum Shinri Kyo's headquarters in the village of
Kamiku Isshiki at the foot of Mount Fuji, about 65 miles from Tokyo.
Inside the labyrinthine complex Asahara was sitting in the lotus
position in a secret room only three feet high and hidden behind planks
which police tore down.
The room was sandwiched between the second and third floors of a
building known as the Sixth Satian, after the Sanskrit word for
''truth''.
Prosecutors now have three weeks before they must formally charge him.
Under Japan's snail-paced judicial system it could take several years
before a court reaches a verdict, but Justice Ministry sources said it
was highly unlikely he would be granted bail.
Although the arrest brought relief, Premier Murayama appealed for
continued vigilance. ''It cannot be ruled out that the sect has been
hiding sarin somewhere,'' he said.
In response, the police today mobilised 80,000 men, about a third of
the national force, to guard against possible new attacks.
Since the sarin outrage in March there have been at least four other
incidents involving gas and an attempted assassination of the national
police chief.
Police today arrested 16 other other cult members out of 40 they are
hunting. The arrests were made in raids on 130 cult sites throughout
Japan.
Police captured the cult leader without a struggle.
''Can somebody who is blind like me have done such a thing (as mass
murder)?'' the bearded, nearly blind guru said to police when they
handed him the warrant for his arrest on suspicion of murder.
He refused medical treatment, saying: ''I am healthy. Do not touch me.
I do not even let my followers touch me.''
Dressed in a white hood and his trademark purple pyjamas, Asahara was
quietly led out to a police car and driven to Tokyo with a heavy police
escort and helicopters buzzing overhead.
Warrants had been issued 12 hours after police made a key breakthrough
by arresting Yoshihiro Inoue, the ''intelligence minister'' of the sect,
when his car was stopped at a roadblock.
Police believe the 25-year-old school dropout and karate expert
masterminded the sarin attack, commanding five two-man units that
released the gas on the tube system.
While Inoue was at large, police had feared revenge attacks if they
arrested Asahara, who has forecast the world will end in an
Armageddon-type war in 1997.--Reuter.

* A trail of melons may have led police to the doomsday cult leader
accused of the Tokyo nerve gas attack. But it was the other items police
found in the family refrigerator in the raid when they arrested Shoko
Asahara that may be news to his followers.
Asahara preached that junk food and oily meat harm both body and mind.
Police reported discovering the following items:
* Deep fried prawns. (The cult's strict diet allows followers to eat
only root vegetables cooked in soup, rice and bananas, prohibiting meat
and fish)
* Junk food. (The cult condemns such things as potato chips as harmful
to health and intelligence)
* Orange juice. (Followers are allowed to drink only special water
treated with electric waves, or Asahara's bathwater, called ''miracle
pond'')
* Melons. (Known as Asahara's favourite food. His craving for melon
may have helped police locate him, as followers' cars carrying melons
had been spotted outside the building where he was hiding).

THREE judges yesterday paved the way for the last of the children in
the Ayrshire alleged child sex abuse case to be reunited with his
parents.
The 10-year-old boy, one of eight children taken into care almost five
years ago, had expressed some reluctance about going home and a final
decision will be left to the court-appointed psychiatrist, who is
looking after his interests.
The first of the children was taken into care in June 1990 and Sheriff
Neil Gow ruled that allegations of ritual sex abuse had been
established.
However, after the Court of Session ordered a rehearing, Sheriff Colin
Miller took the opposite view and decided that the reporter to
Strathclyde Children's Panel had failed to prove that any abuse had
taken place.
Lord Hope, the Lord President who ordered the rehearing, described the
case as a tragedy of immense proportions and allowed one 15-year-old
girl to return home immediately.
On the advice of child-care specialists, the court decided on a
gradual return for the other children, aged between five and 15, and
this has been taking place.
In March this year, Mr Edward Targowski, QC, appearing for the F
family, told the court that two sons, aged eight and six, had been
successfully reunited with their parents. However, the 10-year-old had
expressed some reluctance about returning to the family home.
He added: ''It may well be that his return will take some time and
also require expert assistance.''
Lord Hope continued the case until yesterday for a progress report and
Mr Targowski asked for the court to make an order that the 10-year-old
should now go home.
He said it was clear that a large amount of work had been completed by
the child psychiatrist, Dr John Powell, and that a great deal more work
would be required after the boy returned home. There was still some
reluctance on the boy's part.
Ms Rosemary Guinnane, counsel for Dr Powell, told the court that the
10-year-old was going to be told that he was going home today, but
alternative arrangements had been made in case he didn't wish to go
back.
Lord Hope said it was not appropriate for the court to make an order
for the 10-year-old to be returned home today, but if Dr Powell took the
view that the boy should return to his parents immediately, that was an
order he was entitled to make because of the authority granted to him by
the court.
''It should be appreciated that we wish to give every encouragement to
continue the progress which has been achieved so far. Any orders we make
today are designed to achieve as much flexibility as we can to ensure
that the parents and children have the support they need to bring
matters to a satisfactory conclusion.''
The case will return to the Court of Session on October 17, for what
it hopes will be a final progress report.

EVEN in the powerhouse world of weightlifting, Ian Thomson was a big
man, and not merely because of his 6ft 5in frame. His vision, vigour,
and determination on behalf of his sport marked a career which took him
to the Olympic Games as a referee.
His death, from cancer, at the age of 51, is a blow to the Scottish
Amateur Weightlifters' Association, of which he was secretary from 1979
to 1994. He managed UK and Scottish teams and was chief technical
officer for the British AWA. Only a week before his death, last
Saturday, he was re-elected to the European Federation's technical
committee.
He also served on the executive committee of the Commonwealth Games
Council for Scotland and managed the national team at last year's
Commonwealth Games in Victoria.
He was instrumental in bringing to Scotland the first British senior
championship event, and ensured it was so efficiently organised that it
became a biennial fixture. In 1985, he organised the world junior
championships in Edinburgh, and the Commonwealth Games weightlifting
there the following year.
He is survived by his wife, Iris, and daughters Avril and Claire. The
funeral is at Warriston Crematorium, Edinburgh, today at 3pm.

THE Princess of Wales yesterday made a rare official public appearance
to open a Glasgow drug crisis centre where she impressed victims with
her sympathetic approach.
The #1.3m centre in West Street is run by the Turning Point charity,
of which the Princess is patron, and is the first in Scotland to offer
24-hour advice and support linked to a residential unit for emergency
short stays.
Funded by Strathclyde Regional Council and Greater Glasgow Health
Board, the centre has had more than 3500 visits since opening in
November, some from clients as young as 16.
The official opening by the Princess helped the charity to highlight
the serious situation in Glasgow, which it says has the highest death
rate among drug users of any city in Britain.
She also won the admiration of the clients she chatted to as she
toured the crisis centre. One heroin and methadone user, identified only
as Richard, 27, said later: ''I told her all about myself, where I have
come from and where I plan to go in the future.
''She is a very nice lady and dead understanding. It was a real
surprise to me because the last time I saw a royal was when I was a boy.
But she is just a normal person, and really understanding.''
Another client at the centre, Andrea, 27, turned to drugs after the
cot death of one of her children. She said: ''From doctors and everyone
I was getting the wrong type of bereavement counselling. But I was only
here one day and what they could do for me in that one day was
unbelievable.''
Later, the Princess attended a lunch at the city's Royal Scottish
Automobile Club to mark the opening of Turning Point's services in
Scotland.
A UK-wide charity, Turning Point helps people with drink, drug, mental
health problems, and learning disabilities.
At the lunch, chairman Ted Unsworth spoke of the charity's many years
of experience in helping ''the uncuddly causes''.
He paid tribute to its patron, describing the Princess as ''a fine
ambassador for the work we do, somebody who provides powerful and
unflinching leadership for those of us in this field who are providing
help to some of the most disadvantaged in the community''.
Other speakers included Councillor William Perry who has used his role
as convener of Strathclyde Regional Council to conduct a crusade against
drug abuse. He announced that the council would be granting Turning
Point an additional #94,000.
According to the charity, Glasgow has an estimated 9500 injecting drug
users, about 1.4% of the population.
Mr Andrew Horne, manager of the crisis centre, said: ''Many of the
clients at the centre have had numerous overdoses, some serious enough
to need hospital admission.
''I am alarmed by the appalling physical and emotional state of many
of the clients who come here. That is why the centre is so vital and why
it is so important for us to be accessible 24 hours a day to the people
who need us.''
* The Prince of Wales is on holiday on the vast Wellington estate near
Granada, in southern Spain, as a guest of his long-time friend Arthur
Wellesley, the Marquese of Duoro. The Princess is the godmother of one
of the Wellesley children.

A SCOTS-born teacher with dual nationality, whose numerous attempts to
gain promotion over the past four years have failed, yesterday accused
his employers, Lothian Education Department, of racial discrimination.
Mr Frank McDonald, 47, an assistant teacher of computing and business
studies at Edinburgh's Craigmount High, told an industrial tribunal that
he had made 130 applications for promotion in schools throughout the
region since 1991 but had not even been called for interview.
Mr McDonald, who is an Australian national as well as being British,
has brought his case to the Edinburgh tribunal under the Race Relations
Act, claiming discrimination against him as an Australian by the
region's education department.
He told the tribunal during preliminary discussions that he was also
raising complaints of victimisation at Craigmount High -- where he is
still employed -- stemming, he claimed, from his racial discrimination
allegation.
The tribunal heard that an attempt to resolve Mr McDonald's complaints
through arbitration had failed and that he was now seeking compensation
for loss of earnings.
The Hawick-born teacher, a Heriot-Watt University graduate in business
studies, who is married and has two children, took a teacher-training
course at Moray House, Edinburgh, and later, having emigrated, graduated
from the University of New England, New South Wales, with a master's
degree in educational administration.
When the hearing opened yesterday, the tribunal decided to hear
evidence first from the education department, which denies the
allegations. Mr McDonald, who is conducting his case without a
solicitor, will give evidence later this week.
Mr Gerard Murphy, a Lothian region personnel department official, told
the tribunal yesterday the authority operated an equal opportunities
policy and that job application forms received by head teachers provided
no indication of an applicant's nationality.
He said Mr McDonald's basic grievance was that he had been racially
discriminated against because of his Australian nationality when
applying for promotion.
''He was basing it on the large number of applications made and on the
fact that he had been unsuccessful,'' he added.

MAJOR General Sir Hector MacDonald, known as ''Fighting Mac'', is to
be remembered anew at a ceremony in Edinburgh on Saturday.
The sandstone obelisk over his grave in the city's Dean Cemetery will
be rededicated. It was refurbished, at a cost of more than #3700, after
an appeal by the Clan Donald Society of Edinburgh.
The memorial, erected by public subscription in 1905, had deteriorated
badly over the years.
Sir Hector MacDonald, born of humble parentage at Mulbuie, Ross-shire,
in 1853, had a spectacular career in the British Army, making him a
household name in Scotland. It ended in tragedy when allegations were
made against him and he committed suicide, at the age of 50, in 1903.
After enlisting as a private in the 92nd Gordon Highlanders in 1870,
he became a colour sergeant and distinguished himself in the second
Afghan War in 1879. His dash and prowess earned him his nickname and led
General Roberts to promote him to second lieutenant.
At the battle of Majuba, South Africa, he displayed heroic courage
after the Boers took him prisoner and, on his release, had his sword
returned to him in recognition of his bravery. He became a national hero
after the Battle of Omdurman in 1898, when he was Lieutenant Colonel of
the Sudanese Brigade, which he had personally trained.
When the Dervishes made a surprise flank attack, he wheeled his
brigade in a half circle and turned possible disaster into a victory.
He succeeded to the command of the Highland Brigade after the death of
Major General Wauchope in 1899. He was created a KCB in 1900 for his
services in South Africa.
Disaster befell him after he was given command of the troops in
Ceylon. An accusation, which has not been disclosed but is thought to
have been for paedophile behaviour, was reported to the Governor. Sir
Hector was given leave to return to London to discuss the issue with the
War Office, which decided a court of inquiry should be held in Ceylon.
Rumours were published in an American newspaper, which Sir Hector saw
in a Paris hotel while returning to Ceylon. He shot himself there. His
body was taken to Scotland. Such was his fame that rumours persisted he
was still alive and was fighting for the German Army in the First World
War.
Mr Norman MacDonald, president of the Clan Donald Society of
Edinburgh, said yesterday that Sir Hector, did not have friends in high
places and it was believed that Roberts and Kitchener did not like him.
Many thought he had been ''framed''.
He married in secret and the existence of his wife was not known until
after his death. Mr MacDonald said many considered Sir Hector to be the
greatest Scottish soldier since Wallace.
At the rededication, the principal speaker will be Lieutenant General
Sir Peter Graham, last Colonel of the Gordon Highlanders.

THE power of one television performance to grip the nation's
consciousness is epitomised by Eric Porter, who died in London's Royal
Free Hospital from cancer yesterday, aged 67, and who is still
remembered for his role as Soames in BBC's Forsyte Saga, first shown in
1967.
The role of Soames Forsyte made Porter a star. He was already a
distinguished and formidable stage actor. He rejected all copy-cat
offers of work and managed to avoid being type cast.
His last appearance on television was two months ago opposite John
Neville in Dennis Potter's two-character play, Message for Posterity.
A founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych, he
played a notable Malvolio in Peter Brook's 1991 production of Twelfth
Night at London's Playhouse Theatre.
The son of a London bus conductor, at school he was nicknamed ''The
Professor'', because of his studiousness. His first job, aged 16, was
with the Marconi Telegraph and Wireless Company.
While he was at school, he had appeared in a number of plays and set
his heart on being an actor.
He failed to get a scholarship to Rada but the local schools organiser
had spotted his talent and secured him an interview with Robert Atkins,
then director of Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company at Stratford. He
made his first professional appearance aged 17 as a spear carrier with
the company at the Cambridge Arts Theatre.
He learned his craft with Sir Lewis Casson's company, toured with Sir
Donald Wolfit, and became a member of Birmingham Rep. In 1948, he was
called up for National Service as an engine mechanic in the RAF but,
after nine months, he was discharged.
His career in the theatre proceeded with roles at the Lyric,
Hammersmith, at Bristol Old Vic, and with the Old Vic in London.
A man driven by inner demons, he tried on more than one occasion to
quit the stage but acting was his life. He never married, and described
his private life once as ''negligible, only an annexe to my professional
life.''
In his 50-year career, he appeared in everything from Shakespeare to
Hammer horror films. On television he spanned the schedule from Jewel in
the Crown to two turns on the Morecambe and Wise Show.

A SECOND woman has been the victim of a breast cancer screening
procedural error, it was revealed yesterday.
She was wrongly sent an all-clear letter rather than one asking her
back for a second mammogram.
The woman, from the West of Scotland, could have had cancer for at
least six months without knowing it. She started treatment within the
last two weeks.
Her case was discovered after a review was ordered by the Scottish
Office into all the breast screening records of half a million women in
Scotland over 50 years of age who had been tested since 1988.
The #30,000 review was instigated after it was discovered earlier this
year that a woman in Dundee who has cancer was also wrongly sent an
all-clear letter.
It revealed that 32 other women should have been recalled after their
first mammogram but instead were given an all-clear letter. Fortunately,
further checks have since given them a clean bill of health.
Organisers of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme admitted that
procedural errors were behind the mistakes made in all the cases. The
review they carried out was not a check of mammograms but of the
procedures used to communicate with women once the mammograms were read.
Ms Jan Warner, manager of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme,
said that because there had been human error the woman who was recently
told she had cancer could apply for compensation.
She stressed that other women should not worry as the review was now
complete and all the women who required to be recalled had been notified
and assessed.
Around 100,000 women are invited each year to attend breast screening
in Scotland and Ms Warner said she hoped the findings would not put them
off taking up that offer.
Labour's health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said he would be raising
the findings of the review in Parliament at the earliest possible
opportunity.
''Here we have 34 women who should have been recalled but weren't. It
was just a matter of luck that only two of that number were diagnosed as
having cancer.
''There should be tighter procedures to make sure this does not happen
again. Extra money must be made available to make sure the best possible
system for keeping breast screening records for women in Scotland is put
into place.''
Mrs Audrey Jones, chairman of the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign,
said the mistakes were ''appalling'' but felt people should not
criticise the staff.
Mrs Jones said: ''As a cancer patient myself I know that this woman
who has been told she has breast cancer will be devastated and angry. It
goes without saying that the earlier you diagnose cancer the better.
''People should not turn this into a crucifixion of staff dealing with
breast cancer, as they are under-funded and overworked. There should be
more Government money to sort out a better system to make sure this sort
of thing does not happen again.''
Ms Warner and other SBSP officials refused to discuss the case
uncovered in the review on the grounds of medical confidentiality. They
refused to discuss how much cancer treatment the woman had missed,
although they did say there had been no procedural errors in the past
six months.
They also refused to discuss the woman's reaction when she was
informed that mistakes had been made.
Ms Warner said there would be no disciplinary action against members
of staff.
She pointed out that 99.99% of the 552,558 records checked had proved
accurate.
Ms Warner said: ''I appreciate that what has happened will cause some
anxiety to women but it is important that they should not be put off
taking up an invitation to breast screening.
''Screening offers the best opportunity for early detection and
treatment to women aged between 50 and 64 years of age.''
She added that the SBSP would use the lessons learned from the review
and would also liaise with colleagues in a nationwide National Breast
Screening Programme.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Health Minister, said he deeply
regretted the detection of one case of cancer during the course of the
review.
''I am sad that the review of breast screening records has led to the
discovery of one case of breast cancer in addition to the woman already
diagnosed in Dundee.
''I share the very deep regret which I know is felt by all those who
work in the breast screening programme.
''I understand that the woman, whose details are obviously being kept
confidential, is now receiving treatment.''
Over the past four years, more than 1800 cancers have been detected,
with the detection rate for small difficult-to-detect cancers going up
from 16% to 21% in the last year.

Belfast,
THE first public handshake between a British Government Minister and a
leading Sinn Fein figure took place in Londonderry yesterday.
Afterwards, the Northern Ireland Office Minister, Malcolm Moss, played
down the significance of his brief meeting with one of Sinn Fein's main
spokesmen, Mr Mitchel McLaughlin.
A fortnight ago, Mr McLaughlin had been expected to meet and possibly
shake hands with Prime Minister John Major, whose visit to Londonderry
was disrupted and marred by street violence from Sinn Fein protesters.
Ironically, there was a Sinn Fein protest again yesterday against
Government policy when Mr Moss, the Environment Minister in Northern
Ireland, attended a reception to mark the opening of a new shopping
complex. Mr McLaughlin was present in his capacity as a city councillor
and Sinn Fein's national chairman.
Mr Moss was visiting the new complex in the nationalist Creggan area
of Londonderry. He said afterwards that he had met the Sinn Fein leader
before, several months ago, and had shaken hands with him then but this
encounter is not recorded, unlike yesterday's which took place in the
presence of photographers.
Mr Moss said there were ''clear guidelines'' now established for
Ministers and that they were entitled to meet deputations from Sinn Fein
on certain matters.
Sinn Fein has been pressing the Government to recognise it and talk to
its leadership as it does other parties. Last week, Northern Ireland
Minister Michael Ancram had a historic first meeting with a Sinn Fein
delegation at Stormont. Mr Ancram shook hands behind the closed doors of
a committee room with the delegation leader, Mr Martin McGuinness.
However, the Government continues to resist a demand from Sinn Fein at
that meeting that its president, Mr Gerry Adams, should be entitled to
meet and negotiate with the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew. Both
men are expected to attend a major conference on Northern Ireland being
hosted by US President Bill Clinton in Washington next week but no
formal meeting is planned.
The Government has told Sinn Fein that until it begins to
''decommission'' its arsenal of weapons, it cannot enter into full
political talks with Ministers.

A PENSIONER died in a fire yesterday after setting himself alight
while cooking. A neighbour found the 65-year-old man after hearing his
cries for help.
The neighbour kicked down the pensioner's door and tried to help put
out the flames, before calling for an ambulance.
Last night, police had not named the victim.
Paramedics pronounced the man dead on arrival at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary.
A spokesman for the ambulance service said the man, who lived alone in
the flat in the West End of Edinburgh, had suffered burns to 90% of his
body.
Meanwhile, a man was treated in hospital for the effects of smoke
inhalation after a blaze gutted a bedroom at a house in Floors Terrace,
Dunbar, East Lothian. Three other people escaped uninjured.

WILDLIFE conservationists last night reacted angrily to the discovery
that three osprey nests had been robbed.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds described the latest
incidents as sickening and blamed an illegal team of egg collectors from
the Midlands for the wilful destruction of the nests in Speyside and
north Perthshire.
The setback comes just weeks after RSPB chiefs in Scotland were
predicting that the magnificent birds were set to enjoy their best
breeding season here in 250 years.
Ironically, it is because of the osprey's success story in Scotland
that protection of sites is now virtually impossible.
It is believed the first nest in Perthshire was emptied on Thursday
night and that the same team were behind the two thefts on Friday.
Society press officer David Mitchell described all three raids as well
planned and said those responsible had used sophisticated equipment.
It is thought that as many as 10 eggs may have been taken.
Mr Mitchell described the incidents as ''appalling'' and added: ''It
is sickening that a tiny minority of individuals, mostly based in the
English Midlands, can still behave in this way in this day and age.''
0 In the past, egg collectors had to take specimens in the first few
days after laying but now they inject eggs with chemicals which means
the period of vulnerability has been increased by three to four weeks.

THE Government still aims to sell ScotRail by next April, when the
level of passenger services will be less than those in place today.
It was confirmed yesterday that the franchise holder would not need to
provide overnight sleepers between Fort William and London or Plymouth
and Glasgow/Edinburgh, or Motorail services, or overnight seated
accommodation between London, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.
The draft minimum Passenger Service Requirement for the ScotRail
network even allows the train operator to cut the number of evening runs
between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, charged with overseeing
privatisation, put savings from withdrawing subsidies on the above
services at #5.6m.
Opponents are horrified at the losses and ridiculed Opraf's claim that
there will be ''virtually no change'' to current service levels when
ScotRail is in the private sector.
Critics also stressed that Strathclyde was excluded from the Opraf
document, which sets out the minimum level of services a private
operator in Scotland must provide and for which it would receive
subsidy.
Strathclyde is the largest commuter network outside London, and
ScotRail's biggest customer, buying about 40% of all services it
provides.
Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy dismissed the Passenger
Service Requirement (PSR) as ''the Polo mint privatisation . . . it's
got a big hole in the middle where Strathclyde should be''.
Labour's transport spokesman Henry McLeish predicted it was unlikely
privatisation would occur, regardless of an upbeat message delivered by
Mr Roger Salmon, the franchising director overseeing the sale.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher's office estimated Opraf's
proposals, including major cuts in Glasgow-Edinburgh services, meant a
10% reduction in the existing timetable.
It is unlikely ScotRail will reduce the frequency of Glasgow-Edinburgh
trains but Mr Ken Sutherland, of the Railway Development Society, said:
''It will give the franchise holder a get-out clause to further cut
services should things get tough.''
He added: ''The minimum level of services should at least be those in
place today. Instead, Opraf is guaranteeing only an inferior level of
services in the run-up to privatisation.''
However, Mr Gary Butler, Opraf's assistant director with
responsibility for ScotRail's sale, insisted there would be ''virtually
no change'' to the current level of services when the network is in the
private sector.
Mr Salmon said only that he was planning for a single franchise for
all of ScotRail's services and that the Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive would be party to the franchise agreement.
Mr Butler said the ScotRail PSR -- a contractual obligation on
operators to deliver a specified level of service -- would ''protect all
day-time services, all routes, all stations, including all rural routes,
stations, and services''.
The PSR also safeguarded, for the first time, sleepers from Aberdeen,
Inverness, Glasgow, and Edinburgh over the franchise period which will
last at least seven years.
Mr Butler was adamant Scotland would receive the highest level of
guaranteed rail services in Britain, with subsidies of around 95% of
current services.
The real surprise revelation was that subsidies to run half-hourly
trains between Glasgow and Edinburgh would be provided only between
5.45am and 7.15pm. At night, only one train an hour would be supported.
Only one other ScotRail change was announced by Opraf. At present,
Edinburgh-Aberdeen has 14 trains in one direction and 16 in the other.
It will now subsidise only 14 trains each way.
The document will go to local authorities, the Rail Users Consultative
Committee, and other interested parties for consultation.
The exercise is expected to take two months. Opraf hopes to have
settled differences with Strathclyde by then, in time for the final
document setting out minimum services that a private operator would bid
for.
Formal invitations to tender -- in other words to obtain Government
subsidy to run the trains -- are expected to be issued in September. Mr
Butler said: ''We are still aiming to have ScotRail sold by April next
year.''

LATE-night ghost trains, which are of no benefit to the travelling
public and which are unlikely to carry any passengers, cannot properly
be described as a railway passenger service, a judge declared yesterday.
Lord Kirkwood said that British Rail's plan to provide what had been
described as sham services in Strathclyde as a replacement for the Fort
William to London Euston sleeper, was clearly intended as a device to
get round time-consuming public consultation procedures.
The judge was issuing his reasons in writing for his decision last
week to grant a reprieve pending public consultation to the Highland
Sleeper service, which BR proposed to axe from May 28.
The closure decision was challenged by Highland Regional Council which
argued successfully that BR had acted in contravention of the 1993
Railways Act, which outlines a consultation process to be followed when
a passenger line is to be closed.
BR claimed that because it planned to run late-night services on three
short stretches of line in Strathclyde, presently used only by the
sleeper, there was no closure of a passenger service in terms of the
1993 Act.
Lord Kirkwood said BR had frankly conceded that the three proposed
services in Strathclyde were of little practical use and unlikely to
benefit the travelling public.
''It was conceded that the object of the proposed substitute services
was to prevent the closure procedure coming into operation in relation
to each of these sections of line.
''However, Parliament has provided that if a line is to be closed, in
the sense that all passenger services on that line are proposed to be
discontinued, then certain consequences will follow.
''In my opinion, a railway passenger service within the meaning of
section 37 (of the 1993 Act) must be a genuine service which is intended
to be for the carriage of passengers.''
BR argued that cutting the sleeper was the least painful move it could
make but Lord Kirkwood said the financial considerations which lay
behind BR's decision to withdraw the service were not a matter for the
court.
''I am of the opinion that what British Rail is, in effect, proposing
is to discontinue all passenger services on the three sections of line
and that, by giving notice to the public of their proposal to
discontinue the sleeper service (which is the only passenger service
presently using these sections of line) with effect from May 25, they
were acting outwith their powers.''
Meanwhile, British Rail's appeal against the court ruling is due to be
heard on June 1.
Counsel for BR yesterday asked three judges at the Court of Session
for an early date for the appeal against Lord Kirkwood's decision. Mrs
Elizabeth Jarvie told the court it was important that the appeal was
heard as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry into party funding ruled out Nolan Committee avoids clash with Major</HEADLINE>

AFTER a heated debate lasting more than two hours, the Nolan Committee
investigating sleaze in politics last night backed down and ruled out an
examination into party political funding this side of a General
Election.
It was a topic that could have been particularly embarrasing for the
Government and would have put the Nolan Committee on course for a
head-to-head confrontation with the Prime Minister.
As he left the meeting, Lord Nolan said: ''It would do more harm than
good for us to try and tackle this subject during the run-up to a
General Election.''
For the sake of unity, members of the committee pressing for the
investigation joined in with the general view, that such an inquiry
should be held over at least until after the next General Election.
However, some members of the committee were clearly unhappy at the
outcome.
They eventually accepted the consensus view, that a stance over this
one issue -- important though it might be -- could endanger all the work
the committee had already put into their investigations.
''It would be too politically divisive, and we would be right in the
middle of the party political arena,'' Lord Nolan said.
In deciding, at this stage, not to go ahead with this line of
investigation, members of the committee are still making it clear that
it is open for them, or their successors, to do so after the next
General Election.
There can be little doubt that it is an area that the majority of
Nolan committee members are anxious to investigate.
In a statement, the committee said: ''It would not be within the
committee's present terms of reference to examine the overall nature of
party political funding and, for example, to address such wider
questions as whether state funding of political parties was desirable.
''As noted by the chairman when the committee was set up, certain
aspects of party funding do fall within its terms of reference.''
Nevertheless, it added: ''It would be wholly wrong for political
parties to seek or accept funds against an expectation of, or following
the award of, public office, honours, contracts, or improper
influence.''
The statement declared that the committee took into account the
intensely party political nature of the issue.
''The committee took the view that, because any study of this issue
would inevitably take place during the run-up to the next General
Election, it would be impossible at this time to review political
funding in a non-partisan fashion.''
As a consequence, the committee decided to set aside for the present
the general subject while it carried out its inquiries into the House of
Lords and other areas, and followed up its first report.
''After the next General Election, it will consider again whether or
not to examine this subject.''

A TOUGH programme to clean up the North Sea was proposed by
Environment Secretary John Gummer last night.
It called for an end to over-fishing and measures to protect wildlife,
and improved enforcement of international rules against pollution from
shipping.
The plan forms Britain's priority for action at the Fourth North Sea
Conference in Denmark next month, when countries bordering the sea will
again discuss ways of cleaning it up.
Announcing Britain's main objectives in a Commons written reply, Mr
Gummer said they were to:
* Protect species and habitats.
* Get the European Commission to control over-fishing
* Prevent pollution by hazardous substances.
* Get further reductions of nutrient inputs into the North Sea, such
as  from agricultural processes

The Labour party said it ''greatly regretted'' the committee's
decision. A spokesman said: ''Lord Nolan clearly accepted it was
something he could and should look at.
''The General Election may be two years away, so there is plenty of
time for Nolan to complete such an inquiry and most people in this
country will want to have answers before that election.''
Earlier, in the Commons, the Prime Minister rejected a claim by
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown that he was seeking to turn the
committee from ''the public's bloodhound into the Prime Minister's
poodle''.
He said no-one who knew the members of the committee could believe
that, and claimed the Conservatives had implemented the rules for party
funding set out by the all-party Commons Select Committee on Home
Affairs while Labour had not.
Opposition MPs jeered when he said that it was ''right in an open
society that donors may if they wish preserve anonymity''. Mr Major said
he hoped the country did not move in the direction of taxpayers' money
being used for state funding of parties.
He said it was wrong, if those who helped fund parties, influenced
party policy, as had happened with Labour, where their union paymasters
controlled 70% of the votes at their policy making conference.
Later, Labour deputy leader John Prescott contested Mr Major's claim
that the Tories were implementing the Select Committee guidelines in
full.
He said: ''That code recommends there should be no substantial
anonymous donations. But the Conservative party refuses to divulge
details of donations they receive, many of which are undoubtedly
substantial.''

A LEADING Scottish bishop claims it is in people's blood to be
promiscuous and calls the Church to take a more understanding view of
adulterers.
The Most Rev Richard Holloway, the Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of
the Scottish Episcopal Church, believes that humans are not designed to
be faithful to their partners.
Tonight, he will host the first of the series of four seminars
exploring the themes of sex and Christianity, and what he considers are
the Church's often ignorant views on sex in modern society.
''For the human race to survive, we must go out and sow our seeds,''
Bishop Holloway said. ''God knew that when he made us, so he has given
us a built-in sex drive that I believe is designed for us to go out and
propagate as widely as possible.
''But everyone knows the hurt a partner in a relationship suffers, if
their other half lets their genes run wild with someone else. So a human
dilemma has grown from the need to balance our natural instincts with
our want for a loving relationship.''
The seminars are taking place at St Cuthbert's Parish Church in
Lothian Road, Edinburgh.
Bishop Holloway said: ''God has given us our promiscuous genes, so I
think it would be wrong for the Church to condemn people who have
followed their instincts.
''What I hope the seminars will do is help people understand why they
have this polygamous instinct deep in their sub-conscious but show them
that it is very anti-social to let their instincts rip.
''At the end of the day, the Church is about promoting goodwill and
kindness to all, and obviously someone who is cheating on their partner
is not being very kind,'' he said.
''The Church must accept adultery is caused by our genetics and help
people control their instincts so they can share loving, caring
relationships,'' the bishop added.
Other churches reacted with caution last night to the views expressed
by the bishop, preferring to hear the seminars first before passing
judgment. Father Noel Barry, a spokesman for the Catholic Church, said
it took a very clear view on adultery.
''The Catholic Church has firm beliefs that sexual expression and
sexuality should be kept within the walls of marriage,'' he said.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland's board of
social responsibility, said: ''I think we have to appreciate that people
have a down side and human nature is fallen.
''At the same time, we are responsible beings and we are expected to
be responsible and exercise restraint and control for our own good and
society's good.
''That's why we have the moral law and the Ten Commandments -- one of
which is Thy shall not commit Adultery,'' he said

THE plane which ditched in the Moray Firth yesterday is an example of
some of the oldest -- and newest -- aviation hardware deployed by the
RAF.
Nimrods first entered military service in 1969, built by
Hawker-Siddeley around the design of the old Comet civilian airliner.
They are now showing signs of age and, earlier this year, Defence
Procurement Minister Roger Freeman invited tenders for the #1000m
contract to replace the UK's fleet of almost 28 Nimrods by early next
century.
Already, though, some of the latest electronic spying technology has
been introduced to three of the planes, the Nimrod R Mark 1s.
Yesterday's casualty was one of the trio, stationed at RAF Waddington in
Lincolnshire.
Normally, it would carry a full range of eavesdropping equipment, but
most of it had been removed before the aircraft was flown to the fleet
base at RAF Kinloss for maintenance.
One of the Nimrods was used with great success during the Gulf war to
build up a data bank of Iraqi electronic equipment. Much of the Allies'
success in destroying Iraqi radar bases and missile sites was a result
of the information collated.
In peacetime, its role is mainly in sea rescue, when it is equipped
with sonar locating buoys, and it is often used for co-ordinating rescue
operations and searching for survivors.
Nimrods, which were also used in the Falklands campaign, have an
enviable safety record. Yesterday's ditching was the first in active
service, and only one other member of the fleet has been lost on duty.
That accident happened in 1980, when a plane was crippled by a
birdstrike, shortly after take-off from Kinloss, and crashed into a
forest. The two pilots were killed, but were posthumously praised for
saving the lives of the 18 other airmen on board.
Earlier this year, it was also announced that the Nimrods' maintenance
is being privatised. Two English firms beat off a joint bid by Kinloss
staff and British Aerospace, and are expected to take over later this
year.

POLICE investigating a number of deaths at hospitals across Britain
last night charged a 35-year-old former nurse with the murder of a woman
patient.
Nottinghamshire Police said Ms Amanda Jenkinson, of Raines Avenue,
Worksop, Nottinghamshire, would appear before magistrates at Worksop
today.
Ms Jenkinson, who was arrested on Monday, was charged with the murder
of a 59-year-old local woman, who had been a patient at Bassetlaw
District Hospital, where Ms Jenkinson worked as a nurse, during January,
1994.
A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said a full report concerning that
incident and ''other matters'' would be forwarded to the Director of
Public Prosecutions.

THE new owner of most of Britain's pits was facing his first
confrontation with Mr Arthur Scargill last night after miners voted to
strike over pay.
Members of the National Union of Mineworkers voted by 83% to take
selective 24-hour strike action against RJB Mining.
RJB, headed by Mr Richard Budge, who has been dubbed the new ''King
Coal'', operates 20 pits, mainly in the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire
coalfields. It bought the bulk of British Coal's mines for #815m at the
end of last year.
Mr Scargill, president of the NUM, called on RJB to hold ''urgent
talks'' with the union to head off industrial action.
The ballot was held in protest at moves to impose a wage freeze but
the company insisted last night there would be scope for a rise in basic
wages at the end of the year if productivity continues to rise.
A company spokesman said: ''We note that Mr Scargill has the authority
to call a strike but we hope that, under the circumstances, industrial
action will not be necessary.
''We hope the workforce realise a one-day strike will damage the
company and the industry.''
The ballot turnout was 61%, with the company claiming to employ 4000
NUM members among its mining workforce of 7662.
RJB Mining said earnings continued to increase as productivity
improved, and said the average wage of a miner had risen by 23% over the
last four years.

THE British Railways Board is showing contempt for the travelling
public, and the law, by obstructing people who want to book a berth on
the West Highland sleeper after the proposed withdrawal date of May 27,
it was claimed yesterday.
The accusation was made in a letter sent by the convener of Highland
Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, to BR's chairman and chief
executive, Mr John Welsby.
Mr McPherson said he had received a stream of complaints from rail
users about their difficulty in confirming a booking on the sleeper
service.
He said BR had now accepted that Lord Kirkwood's reprieve for the
threatened service would stand until BR's appeal -- June 1 -- but
appeared to be making every effort to frustrate efforts to make bookings
for after May 27.
A Highland spokesman said: ''In seeking to confirm a booking, the
convener telephoned the BR contact point on 0345 090 700, to be greeted
by a member of the Motorail staff. All that the member of staff said she
was able to do was to accept a provisional booking.
''Before doing so, she read a prepared statement warning that, as the
service was the subject of a court case, the train for which he wanted a
reservation may not run.
''When asked what fare would be charged, the member of staff said
that, because she was employed by Motorail, she did not have that
information.'' To find that out, he had to telephone BR's Fort William
reservation office.
''This call resulted in him being advised that a special number had
been set up for sleeper bookings -- and he ended up back where he
began.''
Mr McPherson says: ''A responsive provider of public services would
have agreed to continue the service for at least two months beyond the
proposed withdrawal date, to accommodate the court appeal and other
consultation processes.''
He accuses BR of trying to put people off travelling on this route, by
making it as difficult as possible to make a booking.
A BR board spokesman last night rejected suggestions that BR was being
obstructive. He said: ''Our position is clear -- we will only run this
service as long as we are required to do so. Until we know the outcome
of our appeal, any bookings we take can only be provisional.
''We cannot guarantee that the service will continue, so we do not
want people to make plans round a train which may not run.''

LABOUR MPs last night walked out of a Commons committee which is
investigating allegations involving Tory ex-Minister Neil Hamilton.
The reasons for the row within the Members' Interests Select Committee
remained unclear after Mr Bill Michie (Sheffield Heeley), Ms Angela
Eagle (Wallasey), Mr Bill Etherington (Sunderland North) and Mr Terry
Lewis (Worsley) went into the Chamber together to report their action.
The committee is looking into claims, strongly disputed by Mr
Hamilton, that he failed properly to disclose a stay at the Ritz Hotel
in Paris.
Mr Michie told Deputy Speaker Dame Janet Fookes in a point of order:
''I wish to announce to the House that members of the Interests
Committee have walked out after two votes . . . one that we couldn't get
consensus ...''
However, Dame Janet prevented him from continuing, insisting it was
not a matter for her. She told Mr Michie he should pursue the matter in
a different way.
Later, Mr Etherington confirmed to reporters that the committee, which
was meeting in private, did concern the case of Mr Hamilton.
However, he declined to give any details of last night's events on the
grounds that committees must report first to the Commons, not the press.
However, later Mr Michie said that the Labour protesters had been
''trying to get the committee to take witnesses other than Guardian and
Observer editor-in-chief Peter Preston on the Ritz''.
It is understood their call was rejected after a six votes-to-six tie
when chairman Tory Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith (Wealden) used his casting
vote.
Mr Hamilton, MP for Tatton, resigned as a Trade Minister last year
over cash-for-questions allegations which he firmly denies.
Writing in last night's Evening Standard, London, he acknowledged he
had not accepted his fate gracefully.
He said: ''Being out of government gives one time to think what one
wants out of life. The melancholy conclusion I have reached is that I
want to be in government.''
Last week, Mr Hamilton was embroiled in a row over a spoof ''seance''
interview with the late Tory MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
A newspaper newspaper claimed Mr Hamilton tried to sell it a
light-hearted account of a conversation with Sir Nicholas's ghost.
Mr Hamilton publicly apologised to Sir Nicholas's widow and claimed
the article was a ''satirical spoof'' published without his consent.

FROM where John Major was standing, young, fresh-faced social
democratic Tony Blair began to metamorphose into a smaller, rounder,
more left-wing figure closely resembling Harold Wilson.
It was like being present as Dr Jekyll was transformed into Mr Hyde.
One moment you saw the voters' darling, the founder of New Labour. The
next, in the full panoply of state intervention, income controls, the
man from Whitehall who knew best, stood Old Labour.
Up until now, the Prime Minister has had to stand and take it while
pristine Young Labour slagged him off for allowing top executives of
privatised near-monopolies to rake in the shekels. Blair was at it again
denouncing managers who made themselves millionaires while the poor
captive consumer got more and more fed up with it all.
But now there was a difference. The Opposition had broken the habit of
a Parliament and come up with an alternative policy. And in proposing
what he described as ''artificial plans to control profits,'' Mr Major
glimpsed the Labour Party of yesteryear. The voice was Blair but the
policies were Wilson, Callaghan or, with a bit of luck Foot.
Who decides what is ''reasonable,'' demanded Mr Major, adding with
satisfaction that it seemed as if the questions asked of Labour in the
1970s still had to be asked in the 1990s. This must have provoked some
heart-searching among the non-ideological wing of the Labour Party who
have come to believe that with 30% opinion poll leads policies are
luxuries you don't need.
History was repeating itself with a vengeance. Mr Nigel Griffiths
(Edinburgh South -- Lab.) called on the Prime Minister to cease barring
the way to a Nolan Committee investigation of the funding of political
parties, a matter last inquired into in the mid-1970s. Mr Major refused
to be forced on to the back foot. His party had complied with all the
recommendations of the Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs on how
funds should be collected. Labour had not.
He easily disposed of Mr Paddy Ashdown's daft allegation that he was
trying to turn Nolan into ''the Prime Minister's poodle,'' but stumbled
somewhat by proclaiming as a high-democratic principle the right to
contribute anonymously to party funds.
He exhumed another corpse from the seventies by referring to the
proposal considered by the Wilson-appointed committee for state funding.
The majority were for it but the minority, including, the Sketch is
proud to recall, two former journalistic colleagues, wrote such a
trenchant opinion that the idea was dropped and a very good thing too,
said the Prime Minister.
Less decisive as it has turned out was the Scotish electorate's vote
in 1979 for or against -- depending on your point of view -- a
legislative, tax-raising home rule assembly. Mr Major, unlike his
Scottish party, has never wobbled on this one and was happy to assault
New Labour's attempt to breathe new life into an old idea.
Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North -- Con.) wrapped himself in the Union
Jack and paid a tribute to one of the two great heroes of the
parliamentary debate of 1979, Mr Tam Dalyell, now imperfectly disguised
as the Member for Linlithgow, but forever famed as the author of the
West Lothian Question.
Yes, indeed, Labour had still failed to answer this question reflected
Mr Major, agreeably meditating on a Labour bandwagon that went from
looking unstoppable to running off the road.
He had found another Labour Back To The Seventies policy, although as
the Liberals reminded us then and Mr Rifkind inferred just the other
day, the West Lothian Question is not unanswerable. It's just that
Labour don't like the answer.

A FURIOUS John Major yesterday made clear exactly where he stands on
calls for regulation of privatised utilities.
In one of the angriest Commons Question Time exchanges with Labour
leader Tony Blair for months, he claimed Labour's plans to control
profits smacked more of ''old Labour'' than new and insisted utility
prices had fallen under privatisation.
The Commons row broke out as National Power, one of the two main
electricity generating companies south of the Border, recorded a huge
rise in profits to #735m and as Labour launched plans for a clampdown on
excessive profits by privatised utilities.
Mr Blair told industry leaders in London that a Labour Government
would give regulators powers to make water, electricity and gas
companies pay money back to customers after profits passed a set level.
He said there was widespread public discontent about both profits and
pay-outs to shareholders and company executives, and he followed up his
arguments at Question Time.
He protested that the utilities had degenerated into an unseemly
racket and called for a radical overhaul of the regulatory system to
give customers a better deal.
Mr Blair pointed to fresh allegations about share options being
exercised by National Grid chiefs before public trading had even begun,
and challenged Mr Major:
''Given the latest pay and perks scandal, and also today's massive
rise in electricity profits, don't you recognise that these utilities
have degenerated into an unseemly racket and the sooner you order a
thorough overhaul of their system of regulation the better?''
Mr Major replied: ''Everybody wishes to see consumers protected and
that is precisely why we have regulated to control prices and why, where
necessary, the regulator has acted to control prices. Utility prices
have fallen during the period of privatisation.''
The Prime Minister said he had not yet had an opportunity to study
Labour's proposals in detail but, as the tension rose and his own
supporters roared approval, he said: ''Artificial plans to control
profits smack very much of old Labour, not new Labour.''
A clearly angry Prime Minister told the Labour leader that the
determination of what Labour called reasonable profits under its
proposed system of regulation seemed impossible.
He demanded: ''Who determines their level? Who says what is
reasonable? What happens when profits bounce back after a perid when
there have been losses? Do they apply just to the utilities or to other
industries?
''These are the questions we would have asked of the Labour Party in
the 1970s. Now we discover we must ask them of the Labour Party in the
1990s as well.''
Mr Blair urged him to confirm that electricity prices in real terms
for domestic households had risen since privatisation, that water
charges had risen by over 40%, and that gas complaints had gone up by
150% in the last year.
He continued: ''The only reason you can cap rail fares is by promising
open-ended subsidy by the taxpayer for private operators.
''Why do you always stick up for the excess profits or the managers
who make themselves into millionaires, rather than the hard-pressed
consumer who is forced to use these monopoly services and is fed up with
the way they are being run?''
Mr Major dubbed Mr Blair's charges ''very well prepared but almost
entirely inaccurate.''
He insisted: ''The reality is that the nationalised industries once
cost the taxpayer #50m a week. The privatised industries now yield #50m
a week.
Fuller details of the Labour proposals were given by Shadow Trade and
Industry Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham.
He said a new pricing rule for gas, water and electricity companies
was needed to link prices directly to profits. He added: ''One
possibility would be to agree a 'normal' level of profit and to allow
increases in profit beyond that level only if prices were simultaneously
cut.
''The extent of the price cut could be related to a formula which
shares out the excess profits between the utility and its consumers.
High profits would automatically trigger price reductions for the coming
accounting period.''
Dr Cunningham also said Labour was considering a windfall profits tax
on the utilities to clear up the ''mess'' left by the Tories. He added
that another bonus of this kind of pricing rule was that it would
automatically work to curb the excess profits from which the salary and
share option bonanzas of utility directors had been generated.
He said Labour was drawing up proposals for a Corporate Governance Act
which he will discuss later this week with Sir Richard Greenbury, who is
heading the committee of business leaders investigating the row over
executive pay.
''I shall put proposals to him for moves to prevent abuses on salary
hikes and share option packages which are completely unrelated to
individual or corporate performance.''
Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken said Labour was planning a
return to ''old-style socialist and union meddling'' in industry.
However, National Power's John Baker, who has recently moved from the
post of #304,500 a year chief executive to be the #180,000 a year
part-time chairman, gave the proposals a cautious welcome -- after
announcing profits of #705m.

THE Government last night suffered an embarrassing setback when it
announced it was delaying implementation of one of the key pieces of its
legislative programme by six months.
The Jobseeker's Bill, which seeks to replace unemployment benefit and
income support with a single new benefit, has been seen in many ways as
a Government flagship in the current parliamentary session.
In the House of Lords last night, however, Social Security Minister
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish said the new allowance would not be
introduced until October, 1996 -- six months later than planned.
The Government insisted there were problems setting up the technology
necessary to implement the legislation and that, with numerous
complications, it wanted to get it right.
Opposition parties, however, insisted the Government had climbed down
on a policy on which it was facing possible defeat.
Lord MacKay told peers, during Report stage of the Bill, that sticking
to the planned date would have entailed ''risks to the smooth delivery
of services.''
The Minister said: ''The Government's priority is to introduce the
allowance successfully through the network of 1200 Jobcentres for
unemployed people throughout the country.
''This is a large and complex undertaking. It involves development of
two substantial new computer systems and very large-scale training
programmes. We have kept the project under very close review.
''Substantial progress has been made, but we have now concluded that
sticking to the planned date would entail risks to the smooth delivery
of services to unemployed people.
''The Government has therefore decided to defer the full operation of
the Jobseeker's Allowance by six months to October 1996.''
He insisted the delay did not affect Government policy, and added:
''Our priority is to deliver a good service to unemployed people. We
believe it right to delay the introduction of the JSA so as to give an
excellent and reliable service from day one.''
However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats seized on the announcement.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar said that criticism by
peers reflected the anger at the decision to cut unemployment benefit
from 12 to six months, and that the delay in implementing the
legislation was further evidence of Government incompetence.
He said: ''The scheme has been ill-thought-out and today's retreat
must be a major embarrassment for Mr Lilley (the Social Security
Secretary) and his colleagues. They ran into a storm of protest over the
drafting of the Bill and now it appears the systems required to
implement it are simply not in place.
''Some Conservatives may be politically grateful for the delay, but
the only real progress would be a major rethink of a scheme designed to
cut protection for those losing their jobs.''
Shadow Employment Minister Ian McCartney said: ''The Government's
handling of this Bill has been both inept and incompetent. Only weeks
ago, part of it had to be sent back to committee because of its
excessive use of regulation.
''Now the introduction of the Jobseeker's Allowance has to be delayed
by six months because the Government's computer system is unable to deal
with it. The Government should admit that this ill thought-out and
vindictive Bill has been a mistake from start to finish and will do
nothing to get people back to work.''
Earl Russell, the Liberal Democrats' Social Security spokesman in the
House of Lords, said that in some ways the delay was welcome because it
gave ''some time to handle the problems of passing innumerable
regulations and of merging the Income Support and Unemployment Benefit
bureaucracies.''
He added: ''We welcome small mercies, but we still deplore the whole
measure.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday defended the fact that a record number of
people are now paying tax, despite the Conservatives claim to be a
tax-cutting party.
He said there were two main reasons why 26.2 million people now paid
tax. One was the wage drift upwards which brought more people into tax.
The second was the fall in the number of unemployed people who were now
in work and paying tax.
He told a Labour critic in the Commons: ''I would have thought you
would have welcomed that drop in unemployment.''
He received unexpected support from former Chancellor Norman Lamont --
often a Question Time critic of the Government -- who said that even
after taxes had been raised to deal with the effects of the recession
Britain had ''by a long long way one of the lowest tax burdens in
Europe.''
However Shadow Chief Secretary Andrew Smith said a Treasury Commons
answer showed that there were now half-a-million more taxpayers than
last year and 800,000 more than at the time of the last election.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard was criticised last night by the Bar
Council, who claimed he was tipping the scales of justice too far
against the accused after he proposed a crackdown on courtroom
''ambushes'' by the defence.
Yesterday's move to require defence lawyers south of the Border to
disclose their main line of argument to the prosecution before a trial
begins, follows changes to the right of silence and to a jury trial.
The police were delighted at the changes, warning that the existing
system allowed criminals to walk free.
However, the Bar Council warned that Mr Howard's criminal justice
system reforms were ''driven too much by the demands of the police'' and
said they were ''tipping the scales of justice'' against the accused.
Civil rights group Liberty echoed the criticism and warned that the
proposals would ''further undermine the principle of the presumption of
innocence''.
Mr Howard argued that the current system was weighted too heavily in
favour of the criminal.
He believes the guilty can get off free because of courtroom
''ambushes'' by the defence which end trials prematurely.
Under the current system the prosecution must disclose almost all its
unused material to the defence, but the defence is generally not obliged
to disclose anything about its case.
Mr Howard said: ''The present system encourages the late preparation
of cases. It is all too easy for the defendant to ambush the prosecution
by running a plausible but false defence at the last minute.''
Under proposals in his consultation paper published today, the
prosecution would give the defence material on which it will rely and
any other material which may assist the defence.
The defence would then be obliged to provide sufficient detail of its
case to identify the issues in dispute.
The prosecution would assess whether it had any further undisclosed
material relevant to the defence's case and would have to disclose this.
The police welcomed the reforms.
Mr Bill Taylor, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers'
crime committee and Commissioner of the City of London Police said:
''It's not an exaggeration to say there are armed robbers, drug dealers
and other serious criminals at liberty as a direct result of the
existing system.''

THE prospect of Yarrow Shipbuilders landing a #200m order to build
corvettes took a downturn last night after reports that the South
African Government has changed its mind.
The Clydeside yard was believed to have been on a short list of two
for the order which could secure 3000 jobs for the next two years.
Managing director Murray Easton and Glasgow's Lord Provost are in South
Africa for the final decision which had been expected today.
However, it has been reported that the short list has been scrapped
and, according to South African Government sources, President Nelson
Mandela is considering abandoning the programme to acquire four naval
corvettes altogether.
It is claimed that the tendering process has been reopened to accept
late revised bids from Denmark, Germany, and possibly France.
Member of Parliament Piet Groenewald said a representative of a German
consortium told members of his parliamentary defence committee that
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had promised in February to reopen the
tender process.
However, a source close to Mr Mandela said he was considering late on
Tuesday whether to propose to his coalition government the abandonment
of the programme.
Opponents of the programme to update South Africa's navy -- reduced
under a United Nations anti-apartheid arms embargo to a handful of
Israeli and local fast patrol boats -- say South Africa needs only a
coastguard to protect its fishing grounds.
Members of Parliament's two defence committees confirmed they were
being lobbied heavily by delegations from Britain, Spain, Denmark, and
Germany.
Cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel said the corvette deal, which could net
counter-trade at least equal to the contract price, would be on the
cabinet agenda on Wednesday. He said the Cabinet would decide whether to
go ahead with the programme and, if so, how to choose from among the
competing bids.
Nobody from Yarrow's management team could be contacted for comment
last night. However, senior shop steward George Kerr said he had no
knowledge of a change of heart. Last night, he said: ''The managing
director and the Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall, along with Campbell
Christie from the STUC and Sir Gavin Laird are in South Africa at the
moment and we are expecting to hear something tomorrow.''

LABOUR'S devolution proposals for Scotland were ''unworkable,'' the
Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday.
Mr Major said Labour still had refused to answer key questions about
how its plans for a legislative tax-raising parliament would work.
He said it could not explain why Scottish MPs at Westminister still
would be able to vote on matters affecting England while English MPs
would be unable to do the same for Scotland.
Neither had it explained why those who lived there '' should have the
pleasure of paying more taxes simply for the pleasure of being in
Scotland.''
He agreed with Mr Bill Walker (North Tayside -- Con.) that the Labour
plans were ''unworkable and a stepping stone to separation.''
The exchange made clear that as long as Mr Major remains leader the
Conservative Party will not be switching to support for a Scottish
parliament remotely resembling the Labour model although, in the wake of
their local elections disaster, some Scottish Conservative have urged a
rethink.
He said there were a whole range of questions which if Labour was
serious about the constitution of Scotland it would have been able to
answer. He branded its policy as ''bad for Scotland, bad for the economy
and bad for the UK.''

UNFOLD those forgotten lottery tickets. Six months after the national
lottery was launched, Scots have still to claim prizes totalling #1.6m.
Yesterday, the lottery organisers, Camelot, reeled off a clutch of
six-month statistics. Among the unclaimed prizes is a #342,048 sum, for
the five winning numbers printed on a ticket bought at a Scottish outlet
on Christmas Eve. It is the largest unclaimed prize in the UK. Unless it
is claimed by tomorrow, the holder becomes assimilated into the folklore
of Great Losers of Our Time.
Camelot's Scottish regional manager, Mr Alex McLelland, said any money
uncollected by winners would be divided up among the lottery's five
beneficiaries: the arts, sport, charities, national heritage, and the
Millennium Fund.
He maintained that in other countries, unclaimed lottery cash was
collected as profit by the organisers.
Across Britain, nearly #30m remains unclaimed since November, with #4m
uncollected in London alone. At the other end of the scale, 60 people,
after striking a line through their lucky numbers, have become
millionaires, including a Scottish couple from Linlithgow.
Mr McLelland spoke in Camelot's Glasgow office, the scene of many
jubilant cheque presentations. He was surrounded by giant bottles of
unopened champagne.
He made it clear that people who bought winning tickets in the first
week of the lottery had until tomorrow to claim their prizes under the
180-day deadline.
Camelot knew from which retail outlet the forgetful #342,048 winner
had purchased his or her ticket but Mr McLelland was unable to reveal
the details until the person had come forward to collect.
Since the lottery was launched, he said, people in Scotland had spent
#135m on tickets, around #5.4m every week. This figure makes up around
8% of UK sales. The number of lottery outlets has doubled to around
2000, with the inhabitants of most of the more remote islands now able
to play. It is planned to open another 2000 outlets by the end of next
year.
However, while the lottery continues to attract millions of gamblers,
lottery beneficiaries have been slow to reap the fruits.
Around #13m has been distributed in Scotland to arts and sports
organisations but, unlike Churchill's heirs, Scottish charities will
have to wait until the autumn before they receive lottery funds, and the
Millennium Commission has yet to decide which projects it will fund.
For the forgetful Christmas Eve winner, the unclaimed five number
ticket is 2, 3, 27, 29, 39, 44 and bonus number 6.

A DOCTOR supervising a school measles vaccine session had to use an
emergency drug to revive a child who collapsed after being inoculated,
Greater Glasgow Health Board was told yesterday.
Dr Howard McNulty, the Chief Administrative Pharmaceutical Officer,
said the emergency was one of about 20 adverse reactions out of more
than 122,000 vaccinations administered in the board's area during the
recent ''catch-up'' measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) campaign.
The others were all minor allergic side-effects involving rashes for
which anti-histamine tablets were required.
The child who collapsed, with what appeared to be anaphylactic shock,
also recovered completely, and Dr McNulty said other factors were partly
responsible for the incident.
''There was no evidence that an allergic reaction was responsible --
it may even have been the shock of the injection itself,'' Dr McNulty
said later.
''Our staff supervising these sessions are trained and equipped to
deal with any eventuality we could think of and the doctor used an
injection to bring the child round -- but it wasn't a case of full
cardiac resuscitation.''
The overall response rate was 87.3% of the target school population
but adding the numbers declining for reason of previous immunisation or
measles itself brought this up to 89.6%, compared with a Scottish
average of 90%.
At the end of the programme, said Dr McNulty, there were 40,000 doses
of vaccine left in stock, thanks partly to tight control of the
cold-chain which minimised wastage, and partly to the fact that his
staff were able to get nine doses from each vial instead of the seven
recommended by the manufacturers.
It has a shelf life to August next year and can be used by GPs for
individual catch-ups.

A JUDGE yesterday threatened to close the public gallery at the Old
Bailey trial of three police officers accused of the manslaughter of
illegal immigrant Mrs Joy Gardner.
Justice Mantell warned that he would clear the public from the court
after a shouted interruption during evidence from a retired member of
the Metropolitan Police deportation unit.
As Mr William Johnson described how a special belt was used to
restrain deportees, a man shouted ''disgusting'' from the gallery.
The judge reminded the jury they were trying the case on evidence they
heard from the witness box and nothing else.
Detective Sergeant Linda Evans, 42, and Constables Colin Whitby, 48,
and John Burrell, 43, have all denied unlawfully killing Mrs Gardner on
August 1, 1993.
The court has heard that Mrs Gardner, 40, died after she was gagged
with 13ft of sticky plaster by officers sent to deport her.
She was also trussed with leather restraining belts round her waist,
thighs, and ankles, the court was told.
Mrs Gardner suffered extensive and fatal brain damage due to asphyxia
through the obstruction of her mouth by the gag, the prosecution has
alleged.
Mr Johnson said he had designed the leather waist belt with handcuffs
at the front and a buckle at the back, himself.
He said sticky surgical tape was used as gags on a number of occasions
to stop deportees from biting officers or shouting and swearing on
aircraft.
''It was very much an exception and only used when a person is so
violent you are frightened for your own personal safety or that of
members of the public,'' Mr Johnson added.
Mr Johnson said that since the discovery of the Aids virus, officers
were worried about being bitten.
The witness said he had taught himself how to use a gag. He
demonstrated to the jury how he twisted a roll of the surgical tape and
put it into the mouth of the person to be gagged.
The trial continues.

THE percentage of National Health staff in Scotland employed on
managerial and administrative work has risen in each of the last seven
years, it was disclosed by the Government last night.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said in a Commons
written reply that 12.4% of NHS staff were employed as senior managers,
administrative or clerical workers in 1988.
Figures showed that this had risen steadily until last year, when the
figure was 16.7%.
They also put the number of employees undertaking such work at 13,311
in 1988 and 17,296 last year.
''Increases in numbers can be accounted for in part due to the
assimilation of some professional staff into senior manager grades,'' he
told Liberal Democrat James Wallace (Orkney and Shetland).

SOME doctors are being forced to join the scheme under which they
manage their own budgets, Labour claimed yesterday.
Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett told the Commons that health
managers ''in some parts of the country are said to be insisting that
GPs become fund-holders and are refusing financial support to
commissioning GPs, which are less expensive and more effective''.
She said: ''They seem to be acting on instructions from the Department
of Health.''
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley insisted GP fund-holding remained
a ''voluntary arrangement''.
However, she emphasised there were benefits to the system: ''It offers
very much more direct control for the GP in securing, commissioning and
monitoring services.''

THE basic public library service will stay free to users and will not
be privatised, National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell pledged
yesterday, announcing initial findings of the first Government review of
the service for 50 years.
The disclosure, in a Commons written reply, that Britain's 4769
libraries should remain under council control was welcomed by the
Library Assocation, the professional body representing librarians.
It had feared privatisation could have meant charges for the 552
million books loaned each year -- 33.5 million out at any time. Mr
Dorrell emphasised the importance of libraries to all sections of the
community and the crucial role they play in the economy.
He said he had no intention of introducing charges for the present
free core of the public library service
Mr Ross Shimmon of the Library Association, said: ''Despite the
threats to their survival, libraries are still a great British success
story. The research for this report shows they are used by 60% of the
British population.''

<TEXT>
THE public faces a nightmare future in which police officers will be
replaced on the streets by private ''bully boy'' firms which protect
only the rich, it was claimed at the Police Federation's conference in
Bournemouth last night.
Federation leaders said Home Office figures showed 40 out of 43 forces
in England and Wales were under strength, with more cuts planned to meet
budgets.
They accused the Government of being bent on creating a ''demoralised
and disaffected police service''.
They predicted a nightmare scenario of the police service in 2020,
when ''creeping privatisation'' would have brought ''policing bought and
sold for private gain'' with professional officers down to a heavily
armed rump of robo-style crime fighters working across Europe for a
federal police force.
Mr David French, who represents the 90,000 constables in England and
Wales, said British policing was being ''downgraded by stealth''.
''We already know that the growth of private security services means
those who can afford it are looking to hired hands to protect them,
using the police only as the necessary back-up when arrests need to be
made.
''There's no plan behind it. There will be no legislation. They are
leaving it to market forces.
''But there are known criminals in many of these companies. The public
have no right to vet them and no comeback when things go wrong.
''It's one thing for a burglar to steal your telly and quite another
to pay him to do it.''
He asked of the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard: ''Does he really
understand policing? Would an understanding Home Secretary sit idly by
when vulnerable officers in many forces are forced to pay for their own
protection out of their own pockets just to stay alive?
''I think sometimes that politicians understand policing like a dog
understands lampposts.''
Ms Diana Reardon, vice- chairman of the federation's constables
central committee, gave delegates a graphic description of the police
service in the year 2020.
Professional officers would sit behind banks of closed-circuit
televisions waiting for action and armed to the teeth with the latest
weaponary.
''While these professionals sit and await the next assignment, the
streets are policed by civil patrollers.
''They are dressed to resemble police officers but are semi-literate,
untrained, badly equipped, poorly paid, and unregulated. ''Yet they
possess the power to stop and search. In short, they are little more
than a mixture of bully boys, more concerned with completing the shift
with a minimum of disruption than assisting the public.''
Ms Reardon denied her picture was far fetched and the product of
watching too many Robocop films.
''Right now, today, private security firms are policing our streets
and housing estates in Plymouth, Salford, Islington, Long Eaton,
Newcastle, Crosby to name but a few, while in Sedgefield the local
council are paying for street patrols,'' said Ms Reardon.
Mr Howard attends the conference today.

A TORY backbench move to make it an offence for anyone knowingly to
employ an illegal immigrant cleared its first Commons hurdle with a
slender nine-vote majority yesterday. MPs gave a formal first reading to
Eastbourne MP Nigel Waterson's Employment of Illegal Immigrants Bill by
74 to 65. The legislation, which stands no chance of becoming law owing
to lack of parliamentary time, was condemned by Walthamstow Labour MP
Neil Gerrard as a ''nasty, vicious little proposal''. Mr Waterson said
it was claimed that 40,000 entered the UK each year with only one in
seven being caught. ''A significant number of those employed in hotels
and restaurants or factories or farms at harvest-time are illegal
immigrants,'' he said.

SCOTLAND'S civil defence facility at Cultybraggan is to be retained as
a possible emergency centre of government in the event of war, Scottish
Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton disclosed last night. He
said in a written reply that much of the civil defence infrastructure
had now been sold or dismantled. However, he said the purpose-built
centre at Cultybraggan would be retained because it housed the ''central
node'' of the Emergency Communications Network.  This linked ''all local
authorities, the emergency services, a number of central government
locations and other sites such as nuclear industry off-site emergency
centres''.

THERE is growing anger over the condition of the site of Scotland's
most famous victory over the English.
The location of the nation's proudest moment against ''the enemy'' --
with the possible exception of Murrayfield in 1990 -- lies buried under
a growing sea of rubbish and housing.
Now a mass demonstration is being planned to save Bannockburn
battlefield near Stirling from what activists claim are the ravages of
the twentieth century.
Glasgow-based expert Mr Ashby McGowan said yesterday: ''The people of
Scotland gained their freedom on the blood-soaked fields of Bannockburn.
Yet, day by day, the battle site is being destroyed. How do we remember
those who fought and died for freedom? With a disgusting tip and a burn
filled with rubbish.''
Next month, on the 681st anniversary of the battle, 30 demonstrators
will rally at Braehead to highlight the plight of the battlefield in the
hope that they will persuade Government and heritage bodies to take
action.
Bannockburn, on June 24, 1314, was where Robert the Bruce's 45,000
Scots vanquished the English army of 140,000 men, commanded by Edward
II. For many historians and most Scottish nationalists it was the most
important battle fought on Scottish soil.
The actual battlefield is a half-hour walk from the statue of the
Bruce at the National Trust Scotland's heritage centre. The site is
divided by a motorway and a main railway line. The area of the fiercest
fighting lies under a huge tip, covered with rubbish and animal waste.
''The tip is where the English king fought for his life, his sword
dripping with the blood of Scotsmen,'' says Mr McGowan, who is writing a
book about the battle.
''But the Bannockburn that once was patterned with the blood-stained
banners of the defeated English is now littered with plastic bags and
empty cans. A new housing estate is spreading over the area where the
Scots soldiers knelt to pray before battle.''
Mr McGowan urged immediate action to save the battlefield from further
damage: ''If we don't do something now, it will be destroyed
completely.''
He claims that saving the historic site would cost about #500,000 but
some of the funding could come from tourism and the Millenium Fund. He
also wants an official body to take responsibility for its preservation.
Mr McGowan has gained strong support from The Battlefields Trust. Mr
Kelvin van Hasselt said he thought it was ''extraordinary'' that
Scottish authorities had allowed housing to be built ''on the site of
its most famous victory''.
''This is potentially a Unesco world heritage site which could attract
one million visitors a year to Scotland if properly managed and
marketed,'' he claimed. ''We would urge Historic Scotland and other
organisations concerned with our heritage to work towards the purchase
of the site and preserve it for future generations.''
Mr Ian Murdoch, of The Clan, said his organisation would not become
involved in the demonstration but he supported the concerns over the
battlefield.
''The whole place desperately needs to be cleared up and we are
willing to help,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for the National Trust for Scotland, which owns the land
around the heritage centre, agreed that there was a need to tidy the
battlefield and seek some means of preserving it. ''But the problem is
the varied ownership of what is essentially a large area of land,'' she
added.
''Although the NTS has no immediate plans to alter the centre, we
would like to replace the building in the longer term. This would only
be possible if the NTS could attract substantial financial assistance --
perhaps from Lottery funds.''
The row over Scotland's historical heritage has taken a second twist.
An ancient woodland, where the English king Edward I felled oaks to
build artillery for his attacks on Stirling Castle in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, is under threat from an opencast mining company.
Perth-based contractors J Fenton and Sons have applied to Clackmannan
District Council for permission to extract more than 400,000 tonnes of
coal over three and a half years from an 120-acre site at Birkhill
Forest, near the Gartmorn Dam nature reserve. The wood is owned by a
Hong Kong registered trust controlled by a local landowner, Mrs Lucy
Poett.
More than 500 letters of protest have already been received by the
council.
Objectors say the forest, which has probably been woodland since the
last Ice Age, is home to numerous rare animals, birds, and plants,
including otters, red squirrels, buzzards, bats, orchids, and lichens.
They say opencasting would destroy their habitats forever, and the
mine would be a noisy, dusty, polluting eyesore.
Lodging a formal objection, the charity Scottish Native Woods said the
site could not be reconstructed once destroyed and if planning
permission was granted, its 10,000-year natural history would be lost.
Among other objectors, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Association for
the Protection of Rural Scotland, and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds point to the proximity of two Sites of Special
Scientific Interest. SNH also warns of a possible pollution hazard to
the Black Devon river.
In an internal memorandum, Clackmannan District Council's countryside
access officer, Mr Ron McCraw, said: ''I do not believe that a forest of
this nature should be sacrificed for short-term economic gains.''

THE British Boxing Board of Control has accepted the need for an
extensive scientific inquiry into the brain damage caused by boxing, and
will announce the formation of a study group this summer.
The move, welcomed by boxing's opponents at Westminster yesterday, is
one of the recommendations of a report prepared for the board by an
independent panel of medical experts.
A draft of the report is being considered by the board. It has already
produced a change in pre-match weigh-in rules: from next month boxers
will be weighed no less than 24 hours before a contest, to protect
against dehydration.
The board's willingness to support a scientific study was welcomed by
Mr Sam Galbraith, the Labour MP who has campaigned to have boxing
banned.
He said it would provide independent evidence of the effects repeated
punches have on a boxer's brain. ''I have pressed them for just such an
inquiry for some time, and am delighted they have decided to proceed.''
The report, prepared by a group of medical experts over nine months,
will recommend setting up a research project to study the careers of
young boxers from the time they turn professional.
The study is expected to take several months to organise and five
years to complete. Boxers will have their brain functions measured
before and after each fight, and the findings will be compared to those
from a control group.
Mr John Morris, the board's secretary, said: ''We have to find out if
there is significant brain damage to boxers and, if there is, at what
level, and what can we do about it.''
Mr Galbraith, who studied the effects of punch-drunk syndrome on
boxers as a neuro-surgeon at Glasgow Southern General Hospital, said he
did not expect the study to reverse his opposition to boxing. ''The only
thing that would change my mind would be if the report showed boxing
causes absolutely no brain damage.''
In February, American boxer Gerald McClellan was knocked unconscious
by British fighter Nigel Benn and suffered brain damage that put him in
a coma. An estimated 500 boxers world-wide have died as a result of
boxing.
The board's principal opponent is the British Medical Association,
which is pressing for a ban and is running its own inquiry into boxing
safety. In 1993 the Government rejected the BMA's demand for an
independent inquiry into the safety of the sport.

THIS by-election, asserted Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign manager
Archy Kirkwood confidently yesterday, is about ''Cinderella and the
three dwarves''.
His reference to the party's Cinderella candidate Veronica Linklater,
brought some unintended humour to what has become a strangely dour
campaign in Perth and Kinross.
The media must take its share of the blame for the lacklustre
performance of candidates, for the relentless search for banana skins
means that inevitably the parties adopt a safety first approach -- a
case of loose talk costs votes.
Mrs Linklater is nothing if not game. Her father Michael Lyle served
on Perth county and Tayside regional councils as a Liberal and her
grandfather, Sir Archibald Sinclair led the Liberal Party before serving
in Churchill's War Cabinet.
The heiress of that political tradition is prone to using quaint
language from that previous era, billing herself as a ''Perthshire gel''
and describing her campaign as ''pukka and chipper''.
However, she holds dearly to other qualities of the past, with a
genuine sense of commitment to public service and evident outrage at the
sleaze which has come to characterise public life after 16 years of Tory
rule.
''It's been fascinating but it's also been a very steep learning
curve,'' she said yesterday, between a visit to Perth library, where
Liberal Democrats had campaigned for longer opening hours, and a trip to
meet parents at a Bridge of Earn primary school.
She admits that as someone whose career as a social worker instilled
in her a dislike of the unpredictable and a preference to be on top of
her job, her new role of political novice has been unsettling: ''I worry
sometimes that I am not doing the party and the people of Perthshire
justice.''
The shire reference trips readily off the tongue, and Mr Kirkwood's
''three dwarves'' jibe at rivals was not the first time reference has
been made to the statuesque quality of their candidate.
She comes across as someone who may at one time have played a mean
game of lacrosse. A formidable specimen of the county set, it is not
difficult to see how she might appeal to a certain kind of disaffected
Conservative voter, particularly given the youth and stature of her Tory
and Labour male opponents.
Born in 1943, she was raised on her father's farm and attended a local
primary at Butterstone. She was eventually to return to take over that
same building, spurred on by the unhappy experience of her own daughter
to found the New School, Butterstone, for youngsters with learning
difficulties.
Between these two shaping experiences, she attended the universities
of the Sorbonne in Paris, Sussex, and London before embarking on her
social work career. While husband Magnus scaled the ladder of Fleet
Street, she developed an expertise in education and prisons, pioneering
visitor schemes for inmates and the Butler Trust awards for officers.
Returning to Scotland, she restored links with her Perthshire
background, opening her school, becoming president of Friends of Dunkeld
Cathedral, and serving on children's panels. She also worked on the
Pushkin Awards, a cultural exchange scheme between Scots and Russian
youngsters.
Then came the invitation from the Scottish Liberal Democrat hierarchy
to enter the political arena. ''I was absolutely astonished when I was
approached,'' she said. ''I thought, don't be stupid, but it was a kind
of extension of what I had been doing with my life, a serious
opportunity to do and to learn something.''
Encouraged by her family, she agreed, only to have severe doubts
again. ''The radio alarm would wake us and I would listen to people
being grilled and think, God, I don't want that. I would put my head
back under the pillow. But, by mid-morning, my Calvinist background
would take over and I would say to myself, don't be so wet.''
And now? ''I wasn't prepared for it to be quite such a bear pit, to be
honest. But the Observer said I was too much of a gentle woman and I
rather resented that. I can give as good as I get.
''Despite all the privilege and luck I have had in my life, because of
my profession I am as in touch with the difficulties, anxieties,
deprivations, and realities of everyday people as anyone. I have also
enjoyed all the joys and miseries and anxieties of motherhood. If you
are going to represent the needs of people in a constituency like this,
you can't just learn it from a book or a party manifesto. You have to
have some experience to base it on.''
Despite her determination, the Liberal Democrats are still trailing in
fourth place in Perth and Kinross.

PUBLICANS were drowning their sorrows last night after the big brewers
escaped censure over beer prices to tenants.
An Office of Fair Trading report said there was no reason to ask the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to examine breweries' wholesale
pricing policies.
Tenants said the OFT's decision would push hundreds of publicans
closer to bankruptcy.
Brewers welcomed the report, which is the result of a three-month
inquiry. However, tenants and the Campaign for Real Ale were furious.
Mr Angelo Belger, chairman of the tenants' pressure group Pubs in
Peril Campaign, said brewing giants were charging unjustifiably high
rents and unreasonable beer prices.
''We believe that 900 tenants have been put out of business in England
and Wales in the last year because of the pressure they are under,'' he
said.
''There have been instances where rents have more than trebled over
the last few years.''
A Camra spokesman said the report was a ''cop out''.
Brewers said they were not surprised at the outcome of the inquiry.
Courage chairman Michael Foster said in recent years major brewers had
''played a substantial part in ensuring that all customers receive the
best value possible''.
The controversy has emerged as competition in brewing increases and
brewers have been forced to grant big discounts to independent pub
owners to persuade them to stock their products. Many tied tenants
complained they were being treated unfairly.
OFT chief Sir Bryan Carsberg said tied pubs were not being placed at a
significant disadvantage.
Free houses were, on average, paying 19% a barrel less for lager and
13% a barrel less for bitter from big brewers, concluded the OFT report.
Tied tenants' rent was generally lower than the amount free-house
owners were paying.
They also benefited in other ways from the backing of a big brewer.
Nor did Sir Bryan criticise brewers over rents, although he did
express concern that some tied tenants had found obligations imposed by
their leases difficult to meet.

COUNCIL tenants in Edinburgh have come up with their own scheme to
help protect their homes from burglars.
Over the next 12 months, the Safe Housing Agency, which is managed by
Edinburgh Tenants' Federation, aims to fit new security systems -- free
of charge -- to around 1600 council homes in areas of the city higher
than average figures.
The project gets under way this week with tenants living in Tron
Square, in the Old Town, the first to benefit.
Tron Square is one of the city's smallest estates but has one of the
highest rates of attempted theft and housebreaking. Tenants in the
Niddrie Mains area will be the next to be offered the service.
The Safe Housing Agency arranges surveys of each house and will draw
up a tailor-made security package.
Owner-occupiers can also benefit from the scheme but will have to pay
for the equipment and fitting costs.
The agency, set up by Edinburgh District Council and the Tenants'
Federation, has funding through the Urban Aid Programme for four years.

A HEALTH trust has created more anger amongst its staff by trying to
attract a new chief executive with a 27% pay increase, in the week it
offered the staff just 2.5%.
Moray Health Services described the across-the-board offer as the most
equitable it could afford. However, a leading trade unionist claimed the
#60,000-a-year package was an insult to the workforce.
The advertisement is aimed at finding a replacement for Mrs Elizabeth
Hogg, who resigned last February following an internal row.
However, the board could not comment on the salary increase because
members of its sub-committee, including chairman Mr James Sneddon, are
all on holiday.
The trust's public relations manager, Mr Gavin Barclay, would say
only: ''It is part of a package. The successful applicant may not
necessarily be given #60,000. You have to bear in mind also that our
capital asset base has doubled from #20m to #40m, while our income is up
from #25m to #30m.''
The figures refer to the imminent opening of the first phase of a new
#22m hospital in Elgin.
However, the move has led local health unions to question the ethics
of the board, which has given staff until May 25 to respond to its
offer.
Moray Trades Council spokesman Mr Conal Smith said it would almost
certainly have the effect of ''depressing staff even more. A 2.5%
increase is hardly recognition for the work and co-operation staff have
given towards the new development.''

A SHAKE-UP of Scottish Office departments announced yesterday will
make around 30 of its 190 most senior civil servants redundant.
The plan is to achieve the 16% cuts without resorting to compulsory
redundancies.
The reorganisation, revealed exclusively in The Herald on February 1,
will see the education and industry departments merge. Responsibility
for environmental policy will move under the same roof as agriculture
and fisheries, a decision which may not go down well in some farming
quarters.
''Putting issues like ecology and pollution control and sponsorship of
Scottish Natural Heritage together with agriculture and fisheries policy
is potentially very exciting but we realise we may have to do a lot of
selling of why it's a good idea,'' said one Scottish Office source.
The review, which is subject to consultation but is expected to be
implemented this autumn, will also see responsibility for roads and
transport, urban regeneration, and new towns move from the industry
department to a new local government, housing, planning, and transport
department. Home affairs and health are to become separate departments.
An alternative structure, under which agriculture and fisheries would
have merged with industry, was considered, as were two more radical
options which would have involved wholesale dismantling of existing
departments and the creation of a larger number of units with a clearer
business or customer focus.
A Scottish Office paper outlining the choices argues that the option
finally favoured would produce ''logical, coherent, and manageable
commands'' which would readily be understood by staff and customers
alike.
The changes are part of the Government's drive, announced last summer,
to save on departmental running costs by pegging them at the same level
in 1997/98 as they were running at in 1993/94. That implies a 13% to 14%
real reduction over three years in the #328m the Scottish Office is
devoting to running costs this year.
Mr Peter Mackay's decision to take early retirement this October
leaves the post of secretary at the Scottish Office Industry Department
vacant. That departure, although it was dictated by a personal desire to
seek fresh challenges, has helped to make the reorganisation easier at
the very top level.
No names have been attached to the most senior jobs in the new
departments, all of whom will continue to report to the Scottish Office
Permanent Secretary, Sir Russell Hillhouse. But it would be a
considerable surprise to St Andrew's House insiders if the outcome is
not as follows.
Mr Gerald Wilson will become Secretary of the combined Education and
Industry Department. Mr Muir Russell will take over Agriculture,
Fisheries, and Environment. Mr Harold Mills becomes Secretary of Local
Government, Housing, Planning, and Transport (a department where the
more creative men in grey suits are scouring the lexicon for a simpler
title). Mr Hamish Hamill takes over Home Affairs and the Scottish Courts
Administration.
Mr Geoff Scaife, chief executive of the NHS management executive, will
join the senior management team, taking charge of the new health
department. Existing ranks and grades will become redundant next year
when the Scottish Office, in common with Whitehall departments, moves to
a new pay structure for senior staff, with remuneration more closely
linked to the job each individual does.
The internal Scottish Office groups which devised the new structure
were assisted by two outsiders, Mr Peter Craig, personnel operations
manager with BP Exploration, and Mr Garth Heron, until recently
personnel director of United Distillers. In addition, the views of
around 40 outsiders -- senior local authority officials, chairmen and
chief executives of non-departmental public bodies, university
principals, the CBI, and others -- were sought.
The decision to merge education and industry was, in part, dictated by
criticisms that Scottish industry continues to experience a skills
deficit. However, while industry will welcome that response, the loss of
roads and other infrastructure issues (including European structural
funds) to the new local government etc department might cause some
unease.

FURTHER detailed evidence that British workers are putting in more
hours than a decade ago, and increasingly more than their EU
counterparts, comes in a new report published today.
The TUC-commissioned report, Hard Labour: Britain's Longer Working
Week, shows that the UK workplace is dominated by a long-hours culture
almost unique in Europe, that many managers are also on excessive weekly
hours, and most people want to work shorter hours.
The report shows that one in four British full-time employees works 48
hours a week or more compared with 20% a decade ago. For managers and
administrators the figure is one in three as they try to cope with
growing workloads or to seek promotion. It also shows that 70% of
full-time UK workers want to work less than 40 hours a week.
TUC general secretary John Monks maintained that long working hours
were detrimental to health and safety, and urged the Government to drop
its opposition to the EU Working Time Directive which seeks to restrict
working to a maximum of 48 hours.

PEOPLE living in Scotland and England stand a poorer chance of
survival from certain types of cancer than sufferers in other Western
European countries, according to a study published yesterday.
For cancers of the breast, large bowel, and stomach, for which the
stage of the disease at time of treatment is crucial, there are big
differences between populations, according to a Eurocare investigation.
Survival in Scotland and England was poor in both men and women for
cancers of the stomach and colon and for cancers of the breasts, lungs,
ovaries, and cervix in women compared to other countries. The
investigation compared survival rates of nearly 800,000 patients from 11
countries.
The proportion of UK patients with stomach cancer who live for five
years after being diagnosed is about half the European average -- 8-9%
compared to 16%. And just a third of those with cancer of the large
bowel live for five years, compared to about 50% of patients in
Switzerland.
Possible reasons for the differences could be earlier diagnosis, type
of treatment or the nature of the tumour.
It also found that for cancers which respond well to drug treatment,
including testicular tumours and Hodgkin's disease, survival is high in
most populations. For most types of cancer, survival rates are broadly
similar across Europe.
Patients studied were diagnosed between 1978 and 1985 and followed up
to the end of 1990. Cancer patients in Finland, Switzerland, and the
Netherlands fared the best while those in Poland and Estonia did least
well.
Survival for adult cancer patients in Scotland and England was at or
near to the European average for cancers of the uterus in women and
lungs in men; for cancers of the rectum, brain, and pancreas in both
sexes and for leukaemia in children.
About 60% of patients with Hodgkin's disease and more than 80% of men
with testicular cancer survived five years or more -- also close to the
European average.

Meanwhile, nurses at Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary expressed disgust at
a pay deal which they claim could see them losing #300 a year, writes
ALISON DANIELS.
According to Unison, staff are expected to reject the Victoria
Infirmary NHS Trust's annual pay offer at a mass meeting today.
Although the trust has made a 3% offer, it is to be financed by a
number of cuts. These are: a reduction in special duty payments; the end
of the unsocial hours premium; conversion of public holidays to annual
leave; and the end of extra payment for nurses working with geriatric
patients.
According to Mr Jim Devine, Unison's senior regional officer, some
nurses who work night shifts in geriatric wards could lose as much as
#665 a year as a result of the cuts. Taken with a pay rise of around
#360, nurses would then lose a total of #305 a year.
Mr Raymond Cowie, the trust's personnel director, said staff had three
weeks to make a formal response and said the cuts were the only way that
the trust could finance a 3% pay increase.
Another health trust has angered its staff by trying to attract a new
chief executive with a 27% pay increase, in the week it offered staff
just 2.5%.
Moray Health Services described the across-the-board offer as the most
equitable it could afford. However, a leading trade unionist claimed the
#60,000-a-year package was an insult to the workforce.
The advertisement is aimed at finding a replacement for Mrs Elizabeth
Hogg, who resigned last February following an internal row.
However, the board could not comment on the salary increase because
members of its sub-committee, including chairman Mr James Sneddon, are
all on holiday.
The trust's public relations manager, Mr Gavin Barclay, would say
only: ''It is part of a package. The successful applicant may not
necessarily be given #60,000. You have to bear in mind also that our
capital asset base has doubled from #20m to #40m, while our income is up

Mr Conal Smith, a spokesman for Moray Trades Council, said it would

ANOTHER sleaze allegation hits the Government today on the eve of the
Commons debate on the Nolan Committee Report on standards in public
life.
Sir Jerry Wiggin, Conservative MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former
Minister, admitted that he had tabled an amendment to a Bill in which he
had a financial interest in the name of another MP without telling him.
In an interview with the Channel 4 TV Dispatches programme being
screened tonight he admitted that he had done the same sort of thing
before.
An embarrassed Mr Sebastian Coe, Conservative MP for Falmouth and
Camborne, told the programme that Sir Jerry had not told him about the
amendment before tabling it.
Sir Jerry, who is paid by British Holiday and Home Parks to represent
its interests, put down the amendment when the Gas Bill was in committee
supporting the supply of gas to mobile homes.
He told the Dispatches interviewer that he had used another MP's name
because he thought using his own ''might be misinterpreted by people
like you''.
Sir Jerry admitted that he had used other MPs names before, usually
friends who were involved in the subject of the Bill.
''I find it's more tactful if possible to find someone who is
interested in the subject,'' he said.
The Opposition is certain to state today that his action raises
questions which should be cleared up.
Sir Jerry was not a member of the Gas Bill Committee, whereas Mr Coe
was. It would not be unheard of for an MP with an interest in the Bill
to ask another Member who was on the committee to move an amendment for
him.
One oddity about the affair is that the MP in whose name the amendment
stands is perfectly free to withdraw it (as this particular amendment
was withdrawn).
But Sir Jerry's admission that he preferred not to use his own name in
seeking to make changes in a Bill on behalf of clients will be seized
upon by the Opposition.
The revelation is certainly the last thing the Government needs as it
struggles to free itself from allegations of sleaze among its supporters
and as MPs prepare to debate the Nolan recommendations tomorrow.
Labour is likely to obtain an inquiry by either the Privileges or
Procedure Committee of the Commons into whether MPs should be allowed to
ask others to move amendments for them, especially if they are
representing some outside body.
Downing Street said last night that if the issue was raised, it would
be a matter for the authorities at the House of Commons and not for No
10.
An official said: ''It would be up to the House authorities to
investigate that kind of thing -- much like cash-for-questions.''
Labour MP Peter Hain, a member of the Gas Bill standing committee,
said last night: ''This is a clear case of gross misconduct and abuse of
the House's procedures.''
Asked why he did not table the amendment in his own name, Sir Jerry
told the Dispatches programme: ''I preferred not to. I think it would
get misinterpreted by people like you.
''I think it is better not to put down amendments in which one has an
interest, because one can't be on the committee to declare that
interest. Where I am technically allowed to, I prefer to get a friend to
do it.''
He added later: ''I personally find it more tactful if possible to
find people who are interested in the subject than to do it oneself, and
that is the way I have always operated.
''I thought he (Coe) would be friendly to this amendment, put his name
on it. It turned out he wasn't and I should have asked him in advance --
I didn't.''
Sir Jerry, who is in South Africa, was last night pursued by a camera
crew for his response to the allegations.
He declined to comment, and, shielding himself from the camera, said
only: ''Go away.''
The Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said:
''There must be the fullest possible inquiry into this very serious
allegation.
''If true, this is at least as serious as anything else Lord Nolan has
investigated and amounts to gross abuse of parliamentary procedure.''
The Liberal Democrats' Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Nick Harvey,
said: ''This is a shocking and appalling misuse of Parliament. We must
include within the Nolan Committee an inquiry into this sleazy approach
to the legislative process.''
Sir Jerry is staying at the Vineyard Hotel in Cape Town. He checked in
on Monday and is said to be staying at the hotel for three days.
He said: ''I am not talking to the press at the moment. I am not going
to issue a statement until I see what is happening.''
The Old Etonian might now be seeing his political reputation in danger
after more than a quarter of a century in Parliament.
The allegations he faces are regarded by Westminster observers as
potentially graver than the cash-for-questions incident.
Sir Jerry, a languid performer in the Commons, has rebellious
tendencies.
He was privately willing the demise of Mrs Thatcher as Prime Minister
some years before her actual downfall. He was also a leading light in
the so-called tearoom rebellion by somes Tories which led to a 30%
increase in MPs' allowances.
He served as a junior Minister in the two departments in which he has
particular interest: agriculture and defence, but was dropped -- to his
chagrin -- in 1983 just when he was expecting promotion.

LEADERS of the largest nurses' union, the non-TUC Royal College of
Nursing, yesterday voted overwhelmingly to jettison its no-strike rule
in a reversal of a 79-year policy of moderation.
Their angry reaction to the Government's ''miserly'' pay offer of 1%
nationally, with the prospect of an additional 2% by way of local
bargaining, resulted in a 488 to 3 vote, with two absentions, at the
RCN's annual congress in Harrogate.
The RCN's 300,000 members will now be balloted on the new rule, which
allows for limited action.
The ballot will take place next month and a two-thirds majority is
needed for the rule change to be endorsed, and even then there would
need to be a further legal industrial action ballot before action could
be taken.
Yesterday's dramatic decision opens the way to possible joint action
with the TUC health unions, who are already preparing the ground for
industrial action ballots among their 600,000 members, in protest at
broadly similar pay offers.
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health for Unison, which has some 440,000
members employed in the NHS, welcomed the RCN decision.
''If RCN members back this decision in their ballot, the Government
will never again be able to drive a wedge between the RCN and the other
half of the nursing workforce in Unison,'' he said.
It would mean that college members would be able to stand shoulder to
shoulder with Unison's nurses and other health staff this year, in an
effective nationwide campaign to secure a fair pay deal for all staff.
However, patients could rest assured that all the unions were pledged
to take action that would not put them at risk, Mr Abberley added.
In an opening speech to RCN delegates, Miss Judith Hunter, chair of
the RCN governing council, called for support for the change -- and won
a standing ovation.
Miss Hunter said that, while the fundamental principle of not harming
patients remained the same, conditions in the NHS had changed. The RCN
would still never take industrial action which would harm patients.
However, she went on: ''What has changed is the environment in which
we nurses are working in. It has changed beyond recognition. Now nurses
are in an environment that talks numbers, data, winners and losers,
statistics, and market forces. These have become the fundamental aspects
of caring.''
Miss Christine Hancock, the RCN general secretary, said directly after
the vote it had showed clearly that the Government had pushed nurses too
far -- the move was not just over pay but over changing working
conditions in the health service.
Asked about the likelihood of industrial action, she said: ''This is
no poker game. There is real concern and real anger.''
Nurses were concerned not for themselves personally, but for the
''reality of what is happening in the health service at the moment''.
However, Health Minister Gerald Malone warned that any sort of action
by nurses ''would mean patients feel the pain''. In a statement, he said
he regretted the RCN decision, adding that he felt potential action was
still a long way off.
''The RCN appears to be labouring under the illusion that limited
industrial action would not impact on patients. Any sort of action would
mean patients feel the pain. Simply put, if nurses do not fill in forms,
trusts will not be able to treat patients and waiting times will rise.
And what forms does the RCN have in mind?''
He claimed that 321 NHS trusts out of a total of 485 had made offers,
three quarters of them at 3% and said that he expected the remaining 164
to have come forward with offers by the end of the month.
Later, Miss Hancock told a news conference it was ''very difficult''
to tell whether nurses would take action in the current pay dispute.
Latest figures showed 115 trusts had made offers worth 3% with no
strings attached -- the condition of the RCN. She believed 300 offers
were needed for victory.
She emphasised repeatedly that nurses would not harm patients and that
industrial action remained for the RCN an action of last resort.

RACIST violence against North African Arabs is part of the furniture
in France, infrequently reported and rarely noticed. Yet the death by
drowning of Brahim Bouarram, a 29-year-old Moroccan, punched and pushed
into the Seine in Paris by a group of skinheads during a National Front
rally on May 1, has become almost an affair of state.
It has put the spotlight on the way the extreme right-wing
organisation, despite its avowed respectability, encourages such crime
with its zenophobic propaganda and notorious fondness for neo-Nazi
skinhead gangs.
On Wednesday, after rounding up and interviewing dozens of skinheads
in the Paris region, police arrested three suspects near Reims, in the
eastern Champagne region of France. Next day, 19-year-old Michael
Freminet, one of five children of a vineyard labourer who had just
finished his national service in a parachute regiment, was charged with
murdering Bouarram.
The other two men who had been with him, Christophe Calame, 25, a
former member of the extreme right-wing group Oeuvre Francaise, and
David Parent, 19, the unemployed son of a gendarme, were charged with
complicity to murder. If inquiries establish there was no premeditation,
the charges will be reduced to manslaughter.
The Bouarram affair has come as a startling eye opener, far too late,
that Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant platform is more than just empty
rhetoric and hostile words.
The attraction which the Front exerts on skinheads who belong to small
eccentric neo-Nazi organisations is notorious. It was striking on May 1
to see just how many such shaven-headed young men, cracking open cans of
beer and bawling racist slogans, brought up the rear of the NF march --
not to mention the large number present in the crowd which later stood
for an hour in front of the Paris Opera listening to Le Pen trundling
out his hate-filled messages.
Freminet and his friends had apparently broken away from the march in
its early stages, near to the Carrousel bridge which links the Louvre to
the Left Bank, and went down to the riverbank to get rid of their beer.
A fight broke out between Freminet and Bouarram, who had been walking
along enjoying the sun and ended up in the river.
That night, Le Pen reacted furiously, as he so often does, to
accusations that his organisation had anything to do with the murder,
which he termed ''an incident''. The outrage was all part of the
extremist leader's rhetoric, for gaining respectability and making the
NF appear an ordinary component of French political life as being a long
uphill struggle, and Le Pen has much to lose.
It was finally a video film taken by NF security services, which had
no fewer than 400 stewards policing the demonstration, along with
information which the party offered to police after carrying out its own
inquiries, which permitted the arrest of the trio.
Immediately after the arrest, considering its honour had been
re-established, the NF published a communique denying yet again that it
had any connection with the three men and denounced ''those who thought
they could exploit this drama'' to sully the party's reputation.
True, none of the three accused is a card-carrying member of the NF.
Nor were most of the thousands of people who marched through Paris with
the Front that day. The three men had travelled to and from the capital
in a free coach supplied by the Front. Police inquiries may or may not
tell to what extent the three of them had been marked by the xenophobic
speeches of NF leaders.
The fatal meeting between Bouarram and Freminet was one between two
very ordinary men right at the bottom of the French social and economic

From LORRIE GRANT, Charleston, Friday
A TEAM of divers says it has discovered the long-sought sunken hull of
an American Civil War submarine that was the first in history to sink a
warship, off the coast of South Carolina in 1864.
The CSS Hunley was intact and could be easily raised to confirm its
identity, according to author Clive Cussler, an underwater adventurer
and author of the novel Raise the Titanic.
The Hunley was found off Charleston on May 3 when underwater
explorers, using a metal detector, struck an unknown target in 18ft of
water.
After digging through two feet of silt, they located one of the
submarine's two small conning towers.
''The sub is completely intact and remarkably well-preserved,'' said
Ralph Wilbanks, one of the divers. ''She can easily be raised using
proper engineering and marine salvage technology.''
The search for the Hunley was spearheaded by archaeologist Mark Newell
of the University of South Carolina, who began searching for the
submarine about five years before Cussler. Cussler paid the #80,000 cost
of the expedition.
The Hunley will belong to the state of South Carolina because
Cussler's expedition group, the National Underwater and Marine Age is
non-profit-making.
The Hunley was propelled by eight men operating hand cranks and could
move at four miles an hour.
It was often called the Peripatetic Coffin for sinking three times and
killing all three crews, including designer and builder Horace Hunley.
The submarine's last voyage was the night of February 17, 1864.
The Hunley sailed out of Charleston Harbour and rammed a topedo,
packed with 100lb of gunpowder, into the stern of the Union Frigate USS
Housatonic.
It backed 120ft away and triggered the charge with a rope fuse. The
explosion sank the Union warship within five minutes with a loss of five
crewmen.
''Though victorious, the Hunley failed to return to her dock and her
disappearance has been a great source of mystery for more than 131
years,'' the searchers said in a statement.
Cussler began looking for the Hunley in 1980 and found it on his
fourth try. Others, including circus boss P T Barnum, had tried and
failed.--Reuter.

From SUE PLEMING Brussels, Friday
NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes was questioned by Belgium's highest
court today over a murky defence contract scandal when he was a Belgian
minister.
''I am very pleased that I finally had the opportunity to say what I
have to say (to the court),'' Claes told reporters after he had been
questioned by the Court of Cassation for three hours.
He returned later today for a second round of interrogation and
repeated an earlier comment to reporters waiting outside the court that
if they wanted to behave like magistrates they should apply for a job at
the Justice Ministry.
Claes has been named in a corruption scandal involving the Italian
arms firm Agusta which allegedy paid kickbacks to his Flemish Socialist
Party to secure a helicopter contract with the Belgian army in the late
1980s.
Claes, who was Belgian economic affairs minister at the time of the
Agusta deal, has denied any wrongdoing in the affair.
Earlier, a Nato spokesman reiterated the 16-nation alliance's support
for Claes. ''The (Nato) allies have confidence in Mr Claes, but of
course would like this business cleared up as soon as possible,'' he
told Reuters.
''The Secretary-General is willing fully to cooperate and to give as
much testimony as possible,'' the spokesman added.
The questioning could not have come at a busier time for Claes, who
faces a barrage of urgent Nato affairs as well as the ongoing conflict
in former Yugoslavia.
Next week he plans to travel to Athens and Ankara to seek to resolve a
Greek-Turkish dispute that has blocked approval of Nato's budget.
In addition, he is to chair a meeting of alliance foreign ministers in
the Netherlands at the end of this month that will review Nato's
expansion plans into Eastern Europe.
The Court of Cassation was allowed to see Claes after Belgium's
parliament voted overwhelmingly last month to allow the court to
interrogate the Nato chief and two other leading Belgian politicians.
Immediately after the parliamentary vote, Claes' private and official
residences were searched by police who left with bank account numbers.
Legal sources said Claes had been asked about the alleged payment by
Agusta of 51 million Belgian francs ($1.8m) to the Flemish Socialist
Party shortly after it won the eight billion franc ($276m) helicopter
contract.
Last February, Claes admitted after earlier denials that he had been
told by the former party treasurer Etienne Mange that Agusta had offered
the Socialist Party a ''gift''. Claes said he had instructed Mange to
turn down the offer.
Mange, who has been in jail along with three others since February
over the Agusta affair, said through his lawyers he had ignored Claes'
advice and accepted the money.

Orkney, South Africa, Friday
EXHAUSTED rescuers today hauled most of the bodies of 104 men killed
in one of South Africa's worst gold mine disasters from the bloody pit
where they died.
As 74 smashed and bloodied bodies were brought to the surface one
miner believed to be among the dead turned up alive and told how he had
missed his shift.
''We have found someone who was meant to be on that shift but who
didn't go down,'' said a spokeswoman for mine owners Anglo American
Corporation.
The men plunged to their deaths on Wednesday night when a 12-tonne
underground locomotive toppled down a 1[1/2]-mile deep vertical pit
shaft and crushed the lift cage in which they were travelling.
Black and white miners waiting to start work at the Vaal Reefs Gold
Mine stared in horror today as rescuers, their boots spattered in blood,
carried the mangled remains of friends and workmates to the surface.
All the victims were blacks from South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique and
Botswana, mine officials said.
Rescuer Garth Ellis said the accident was the worst he had seen. The
shaft bottom, where the lift cage came to a rest after plunging hundreds
of feet, was full of blood and water, he said.
Mine officials said the remains recovered today were so badly mangled
that rescuers working with angle-grinders to cut through a tangle of
steel did not know exactly how many bodies they had found.
President Nelson Mandela has declared a national day of mourning on
May 17.
Mines minister Pik Botha has called for an independent inquiry into
the disaster.
The government wants quick answers as to how the train, whose driver
leapt to safety, swept through safety barriers and other devices which
should have halted it.--Reuter.

From SUSAN CORNWELL, Kiev, Friday
TENS of thousands of Ukrainians roared their approval today when
President Bill Clinton told them the United States would support their
drive for prosperity and praised their country for giving up nuclear
weapons.
Usually reserved students cheered wildly and elderly Ukrainians wept
as Clinton made his emotionally-charged address outside Kiev's
red-colonnaded state university.
''Your nation can claim responsibility for a major contribution to
global peace,'' the president told the crowd.
After weeks of debate, a United Nations conference agreed yesterday
indefinitely to extend the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which
has underpinned arms control for 25 years. Clinton said Kiev had set an
example in arms reduction.
''Your wise decision to eliminate nuclear weapons on your territory
has earned your nation respect and gratitude everywhere in the world.''
The loudest cheers went up when he ended his speech with the
traditional exhortation ''Slava Ukraini'' (Glory to Ukraine).
While many thousands packed the square for Clinton's speech, thousands
more lined his route throughout the city a day after problem-free talks
with President Leonid Kuchma culminating in an extra $27m of aid, mostly
in the defence sphere.
After visiting Babi Yar, a ravine where the Nazis massacred more than
100,000 people, mostly Jews, and a tour of the city's major tourist
sites, Clinton left for home.
His warm remarks and welcome contrasted sharply with the summit that
preceded it in Moscow. Talks there were dominated by controversy over
Russia's plans to sell nuclear technology to Iran, its objections to
Nato expansion and its continuing campaign against separatist Chechnya.
Outside the university, the mainly young crowd cheered when Clinton
told them Washington would help them bear the sacrifices endured in
moving towards a market economy.
''You should know this. As you build your future the United States
will stand with you,'' he said.
''For America's support for an independent Ukraine in its recognised
borders is not only a matter of sympathy. It is in our own national
interests as well.''
He told the crowd, gathered since early morning and entertained by
Ukrainian rock bands, that Washington and Ukraine would ''help design
the architecture of security in an undivided Europe so that Ukraine's
security is strengthened''.
Ukraine's leadership had worked hard to eliminate irritants in ties,
securing parliamentary approval for the NPT and launching the country's
first post-Soviet economic reforms.
Clinton started the day by placing a wreath at the obelisk in the Park
of Glory honouring up to eight million people killed in Ukraine's fight
against Nazi occupation.
He later stood in silence alongside his wife Hillary at Babi Yar, one
of the first sites of mass Nazi killing of Jews.
''The victims of Babi Yar cry out to us still,'' he said next to a
Jewish menorah. ''Never forget they tell us that humanity is capable of
the worst just as it is capable of the best.''--Reuter.

Kinshasa, Friday
INTERNATIONAL experts arrived at the centre of Zaire's Ebola virus
outbreak today as one of the most lethal diseases known to man spread to
a third town and the death toll reached 48.
Zaire's top virologist said the epidemic was moving into a second
phase in which the death toll was expected to rise.
But the World Health Organisation and the aid group Medecins Sans
Frontieres, who have experts battling the disease on the ground, were
confident it could be contained.
Professor Jacques Muyembe, head of virology at Kinshasa University,
said in Kikwit, where the virus surfaced at the start of the month, that
it was potentially more serious than a 1976 epidemic which killed
several hundred people in a small Zaire village.
''It's much more frightening, more serious in the sense that Kikwit is
a town of more than 400,000 people,'' he said.
Kikwit itself, on the fringe of tropical rain forest 300 miles east of
the capital Kinshasa, appeared normal today, with markets and streets
full of people.
But residents said there was widespread fear. As the latest
international team arrived from Kinshasa scores of people milled around
outside its ramshackle hospital waiting for news of relatives.
''People won't even shake hands,'' one resident said.
* Britain is ''strongly advising'' its nationals against visiting the
Central African state.
About 400 Britons live in Zaire but the Foreign Office has no plans to
get them out.
The Government's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Ken Calman, said: ''The
risk of the Ebola virus coming to the UK is remote, particularly if
efforts to contain the virus in the affected part of Zaire are
successful.
''We are watching the situation closely. My advice to anyone returning
from Zaire is to contact a doctor if they suffer a sudden onset of fever
within three weeks of their departure.''

From SEAN MAGUIRE, Sarajevo, Friday
UNITED Nations chiefs called for a full review of their peacekeeping
mandate in Bosnia today and hinted that the embattled 22,000-strong UN
force could be withdrawn.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali met the UN mission's
diplomatic and military commanders in Paris to assess its crumbling
morale and sense of impotence under armed attack and harassment.
He said he would seek a Security Council review of the mandate in
Bosnia because of increased fighting and attacks on peacekeepers since a
ceasefire between government and Serb forces ended on May 1.
His spokesman in New York, Joe Sills, said that ''what we are being
asked to do (in Bosnia) is becoming untenable . . . the gap is widening
between the mandate and the resources that we have and what is expected
of us.''
Sills did not say outright that Boutros-Ghali would urge a withdrawal
of the mission and Security Council President Jean-Pierre Merimee said
he thought it was unlikely.
France and Britain, which contribute the largest troop contingents,
are unilaterally threatening to pull out their forces but even a partial
withdrawal would be an immense military risk requiring intervention by
Nato and the United States.
Military strategists believe the Muslim-led government, its forces
handicapped against the Serbs by a UN weapons embargo, have most to lose
from a UN departure.
The peace process in Bosnia has been brought to a standstill by the
refusal of Serbs to sign a territorial division proposed by a Big Power
Contact Group.
Officials of the group -- the United States, Russia, France, Britain
and Germany -- also met today and called on the warring sides to respect
UN authority.
The UN crisis of confidence in Bosnia has been provoked by its
inability to curb a tightening of the Serb siege around Sarajevo and
restrictions on its operations.
General Rupert Smith, the UN commander in Bosnia, joined the Paris
talks after issuing fresh orders to his troops to fire back at attackers
from both sides who regularly targeting them.
He acted after a French UN soldier was critically wounded by a sniper
yesterday in Sarajevo where two French soldiers were shot dead last
month.
UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko told reporters: ''These attacks must
cease immediately and General Smith has informed his troops . . . that
they should not hesitate to use force when targeted by either warring
party.''
The latest French casualty was the victim of a freak shot which went
through his head while he used a thermal imaging device to peer through
a tiny aperture between sandbags.
Peacekeepers were angered when Serbs, who have taken effective control
of Sarajevo airport, refused to allow him to be evacuated from the city
by helicopter.
His departure by another aircraft was delayed for two hours while a
Serb liaison officer argued that he should leave by mountain roads
liable to attack by Serb gunners.
UN officials in Bosnia have openly challenged the terms of their role
since mission chiefs ruled out punitive Nato air strikes against Serbs
who killed 11 people in a shelling attack in Sarajevo on Sunday.
With the level of violence escalating again and UN and civilian
casualty figures growing, a spokesman said they cannot protect Sarajevo
without Nato's help.--Reuter.

From PATRICK BROGAN, Washington, Friday
THE FBI has put out the name of its latest suspect in the Oklahoma
City bombing: Steven Colbern. He is said to be a member of an extremist
militia, the Arizona Patriots, and an associate of prime suspect Timothy
McVeigh.
He is said to drive a brown pickup truck. Such a vehicle was seen
travelling alongside McVeigh's car 90 minutes after the bombing when
McVeigh was stopped for speeding on an interstate north of Oklahoma
City.
His car lacked a number plate, and he was found to be carrying a
concealed weapon and was arrested.
Two days later, he was identified as the suspect described as ''John
Doe number 1'' and has since been charged with the bombing.
The pickup stopped when McVeigh was pulled over, and then drove away.
The FBI will not say whether it thinks Colbern might be John Doe number
2, the man who, with McVeigh, allegedly rented the Ryder removal truck
that was used in the attack.
McVeigh lived in a motel in Kingman, Arizona, for several months in
late 1994 and early this year. Colbern was reportedly one of the people
he met there.

THE Minister of State for Transport, Mr John Watts, was due to give a
keynote speech to the Tory conference yesterday on the Government's
success in developing the Scottish transport infrastructure.
Unfortunately, he was delayed for 20 minutes on his flight from
Aberdeen to Glasgow, and then stuck in traffic on the Kingston Bridge,
which needs #10m worth of patchwork repairs to stop it sinking.
The conference had to rejig tight schedules to ensure Mr Watts could
deliver his address, the last before the Prime Minister took the stage.
Delegates were subsequently warned there would be only two ''short
contributions'' from the floor in the so-called transport debate -- at a
time when Scotland is a cauldron over transport issues, including
threats to Highland rail sleeper services.
Observers noted the motion -- selected out of 19 submitted -- merely
referred to a restructuring rather than a privatisation of the railways.
It read: This Conference notes the commitment of the Government to
developing the transport infrastructure of Scotland, applauds it on the
transformation of our road system, bus services, and airports, and looks
forward to a similar success in the restructuring of our rail services.
Among motions turned down was one from Aberdeen South that urged ''the
maintenance of Scottish railway sleeper links''.
Another, from Edinburgh South, called on the Government ''to place on
hold the privatisation of British Rail'' until the current position
stabilised and was seen to be providing a reliable, acceptable service
to the travelling public.
Paisley North also lost out, on seeking a motion that ''welcomed''
railway privatisation and which urged the Government to take every
opportunity ''to publicise the benefits of this policy''.
The Conservative Woman's Scottish Council had hoped for a debate on
concerns over road and rail communications, especially Motorail and
sleeper services -- ''bearing in mind the implications for both
businesses and the tourist industry''.
The final result was so bland that Mr David McLetchie, chairman of
SCUA, had to be reminded a vote was necessary -- after dismissing the
audience. Dissenters could be counted on one hand.
In his speech, Mr Watts made no reference to Highland Regional
Council's legal action which has brought a reprieve for the Fort
William-London sleeper service which British Rail wants to withdraw.
There was also no mention of ScotRail's threats to slash services and
jobs unless more subsidy is forthcoming.
Mr Watts was adamant railway privatisation is good news for passengers
and business, and that it will produce a better service for all rail
users.
He cited success stories including British Airports, National Express,
and the British Airports Authority, and added: ''If ever there was an
industry which was in need of the skills which the private sector can
bring it is the railways.''
He insisted the decline in railways was not in a failure to invest but
that nationalisation had failed because it was unresponsive to
consumers' needs.
He said passenger requirements will ''safeguard services on every
route and every line to every destination''.
He also promised more roads to relieve congestion and delay. Mr Watts
said Britain's transport services and infrastructure have been
transformed, although much was still to be done -- not necessarily at
taxpayers' expense.
The private sector would continue to be tapped to help fund a
transformation which, in Scotland, already included the Skye Bridge, to
be opened later this year, A74 upgradings, and preparations for a second
Forth road bridge.
Mr Watts received polite applause, one of the few not to receive a
standing ovation from the party faithful.
* Moves to have an electrification of the Edinburgh-Aberdeen line
included in a list of routes eligible for funding by the European
Parliament, due to be ratified next week, got under way yesterday.

TWO former Tory Chancellors weighed into the debate over interest
rates yesterday, with stinging criticisms of the way the Government is
handling monetary policy and the battle against inflation.
As the consequences of last Friday's decision not to increase rates
continued to reverberate around Westminster, Mr Norman Lamont warned
against sacrificing low inflation for short-term political gains.
Lord Lawson attacked Chancellor Kenneth Clarke for allowing his
''foolish and damaging'' disagreement with the Bank of England to become
public. Mr Clarke had been wrong to ignore the bank's advice that a rate
rise was necessary to counter inflationary pressures.
Yesterday, a soaring pound brought the Chancellor temporary relief, as
his colleagues came to his defence against suggestions from the Tory
right that the Chancellor's handling of the economy had become a
liability.
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, said: ''Anybody
who says Kenneth Clarke should be sacked is, frankly, barking.'' He
reasserted the Government's commitment to the fight against inflation.
However, in a speech to the Freedom Association in Cheltenham, Mr
Lamont said it was wrong for the Government to put its record of low
inflation at risk for political reasons. Control of inflation was vital
to the Government's future.
''It would be foolish in the extreme if the Government weakened in any
way its grip on inflation in the illusory pursuit of a revival of the
so-called feel-good factor,'' he said.
His speech gave a clear signal to his successor and the rest of the
Cabinet that the Tory right is not prepared to see the party's
commitment to ''sound money'' abandoned.
Mr Clarke announced last Friday that he had decided against an
increase in interest rates, following a meeting with Bank Governor Mr
Eddie George during which it is understood Mr George pressed for a rate
increase.
On Thursday, in Aberdeen, Mr George revealed the extent of the rift
between the bank and the Government over the handling of the economy by
blaming ''inadequate'' Government policies for the recession and warning
that interest rates would have to go up in the future.
Mr George's criticisms and his admission that, on the recent run of
low inflation, ''I often wake up in the night fearing it might all be
thrown away'', have been seized on by the markets and Labour as proof
that the Government is more interested in short-term political gains. Mr
Clarke insists his decision was taken for strictly economic reasons.
Mr Lamont said: ''I believe Kenneth Clarke's assurance that interest
rates are not being set according to political criteria.'' However, low
inflation was a moral issue.
He added: ''The argument over the last week reinforces my view that it
is essential that the Bank of England be made independent and
accountable for the conduct of monetary policy. Low inflation should not
be a political question.''
''At present, core inflation is in the top half of the 1% to 4% band.
The Government's target is to be in the lower part of this band not at
the end of this Parliament, but now. The aim of policy in setting
interest rates must be to get inflation down, not just to stop it
rising.''
Mr Lamont rejected the view that economic recovery was enough to
secure victory for the Government at the next election. ''The recession
ended and the recovery began nearly three years ago. Over that period,
the Government's popularity, far from recovering, has steadily declined.
''It would be folly to expect that more of the same from the economy
for the next two years would restore what has been lost, in terms of the
Government's popularity.''
Lord Lawson, speaking on BBC Radio, reiterated his belief in an
independent central bank with full control of monetary policy: ''I
believe Mr Clarke was wrong not to put up interest rates but I'm
prepared to believe that he took this decision entirely on economic
grounds.
''The point is that markets won't believe that.''
Meanwhile, Mr Clarke has written to Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
demanding Labour make clear its policy on inflation and interest rates:
''The public have a right to know whether you and Tony Blair think
interest rates should have gone up or stayed the same last Friday.''

ROBBIE DINWOODIE, Scottish Political Correspondent, reports from the
Scottish Conservative Party Conference in Glasgow
THE Tories were accused yesterday of missing out on a populist move
which would have commanded widespread electoral support, as their
Scottish conference failed to table a bid to prevent the elderly from
having their life savings seized to pay for residental care.
At present, savings and assets worth more than #8000, including the
family home, can be clawed back to pay for residential care -- a power
which was condemned during several debates yesterday.
However, a move by Edinburgh Tory council leader, Mrs Daphne Sleigh,
to raise this figure to #50,000 was not accepted as an amendment,
although it would probably have received near unanimous support.
Councillor Sleigh said afterwards that she was disappointed her move
had been blocked -- ostensibly because of pressures of time -- as it
would have been a clear signal that the party was listening to feedback
on the doorsteps.
Social Security Minister Lord MacKay did promise in his response to
listen to these concerns but nothing will now go forward in writing from
the conference to force his hand.
The incident highlighted the nature of the Conservatives' Scottish
conference -- staged by the voluntary wing of the Tory movement, it is
essentially voluntary and advisory and its deferential nature at a time
when party fortunes are at a low ebb came in for criticism yesterday.
Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association vice-chairwoman, Mrs
Annabel Goldie, was frank about the lacklustre nature of the conference,
telling a question-and-answer session: ''We are too bland, at times too
obedient, at times too tight-lipped.
''At times, we should just unzip and say what we feel. Conference is
too bland, too predictable, too acquiescent, too safe, and too
uncritical. I don't think we stimulate ourselves by following that
pattern or earn the respect and interest of the wider Scottish
electorate.'
However, the following debate, on the social security system, should
have had before it precisely the kind of thing that would indicate
genuine debate -- an amendment which would have stood a strong chance of
being accepted by conference.
Mrs Sleigh called on the Government to review the capital allowance on
which contributions to residential and nursing care are based, raising
this from #8000 to #50,000. For reasons of time, with the conference
running late, she was not allowed to have her amendment formally put to
the vote, although she was allowed to speak on the subject.
In an impassioned plea, she told delegates that Tory rhetoric had
turned sour.
''What happened to helping those who help themselves, rewarding
effort, diligence, self-reliance?'' she asked.
''There is a whole generation of people, most of whom have been our
loyal supporters for many years, people who have come through World War
Two, put their lives together after the conflict, followed Conservative
principles of hard work, saving, providing for their families, buying
their own homes, securing a pension, and pride of achieving for their
old age.
''They are today's elderly and they believed the Prime Minister when
he said that in a Conservative Britain the fruits of their labour would
cascade down to the next generation.''
She said there was no longer an incentive to work hard and make
sacrifices when, at the end of the day, the State rendered responsible
elderly people paupers, no better off than had they made no provision.
''The lesson is clear for future generations -- spend as you make it,
save nothing and you will get exactly the same at the end of the day as
those who behave more prudently. This is not Conservatism -- this is
Communism,'' she said.
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish told her: ''That question and a number of
other questions on care and carers are very much under consideration at
present. We are taking these problems very seriously.''
Mrs Sleigh made clear afterwards that she accepted Lord MacKay was
sincere on this but she felt it was wrong that her amendment had not
been tabled formally.
Such a wording passed by conference. Existing in black and white it
would have forced the department's hand and given activists something
tangible to take back to voters as a sign that Tories were acting on
their concerns.
* Scottish Office Health Minister, Lord Fraser of Carmylie, spoke
yesterday not for 12 minutes but for a period of #490,867. That, he
said, was the sum spent on the NHS in Scotland during the time he was on
his feet at the conference.
In an unlikely Conservative boast, he said he was the biggest spending
Health Minister in the history of the NHS in Scotland, disbursing one
third of the entire Scottish Office budget, #900 for every adult and
child in Scotland and 23% more per head than in England.
Lord Fraser said there had been a 4.4% fall in waiting lists, 300,000
extra patients were being treated annually compared to five years ago,
and there were 34% more qualified nurses compared to 1979.
These achievements, he claimed, were not to be found in ''press
fiction'' about the health service. He complained: ''Every change we
have made to improve the health service has been presented as a cut.''
Meanwhile, Scottish party chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, issued a
thinly-veiled attack on the party's internal critics, such as Scottish
backbenchers Allan Stewart and Bill Walker.
''I sympathise with our supporters who despair about disunity in the
Parliamentary party and interpret that indiscipline as a lack of purpose
and direction in the Government,'' he said.
''I get just as fed up as you do when I see some of our MPs popping up
on Westminster Green to criticise John Major or some important issue of
policy.
''These MPs don't own the party and they should not forget that they
wouldn't be there if it weren't for the efforts of the voluntary
workers. The one and only lesson that our Parliamentary party could
usefully learn from Labour is the discipline of hunger for power.''
Criticising Labour's ''magpie tendency'' to steal policies from the
Tories, he said the greatest achievement of the Conservatives had been
to change the political culture of Scotland irreversibly so that
opponents now supported many policies they had previously opposed.
