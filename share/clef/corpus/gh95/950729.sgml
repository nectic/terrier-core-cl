THE just society is a little like Heaven. Most of us are agreed as to
what it should be and most of us know from experience that it is hard to
achieve. The problem with all utopias is not in their nature but in how
to get there, and then how to stay there. In our hearts, as well as in
our minds, we all desire and seek that gentle, fair, and considerate
society of near equals, each having regard and respect for the other,
and especially for the very young and the very old.
These are, of course, the sentiments of the family writ large and
almost exactly the same values are shared by all the world's peoples, be
they Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Confucians, Yoruba,
or Aborigines. Happily, therefore, all humans nurture the same ideals of
a similar just society built on familial behaviour and principles. They
are the abiding values of the spiritual state of humanity, and we ignore
them at our peril.
The strength of our spiritual roots is the best of news and the worst
of news. It is the best because we are agreed about the nature of the
world we wish to live in. It is the worst because we cling to the
importance of insignificant details of the particular historic religious
expressions of the one source of our spiritual longings we call God.
Nothing more terrible stands between that longing for the larger family
we call society than the unchanging belief that we are right and they
are wrong. Having just emerged from the Holocaust, it is mind-numbing
that we are content to tolerate the injustices of Bosnia, Israel, Iraq,
Zululand, Chechnya, and Northern Ireland.
In the search for the just society there have been many milestones.
The Greeks gave much thought to the matter. The Romans acted more wisely
and their pragmatic appreciation of human frailty was evident in their
constitutional curbs on power and in their insistence on the rule of
law. Their statement that ''the government that governs best is the
government that governs least'' remains true to this day. Good
government has therefore to be small government. We all know that power
and size go together. Both are corrupting and in extreme cases extremely
so. The greatest threat to the just society has always been big
government, even when that government has been democratically elected.
The instrument of the just society is therefore the rule of law. There
can be no civilisation or justice without the law. At the same time,
there can be no law without morality and there can be no morality
without eternal values -- the ethical principles of all religions. But,
given the law, to be useful it must be practised effectively and
efficiently. At present that is far from so. Legal procedures are too
slow and too expensive. Justice delayed is justice denied.
If this first defence of the just society is flawed, it is because the
machinery of the law is mired in the profession of law. As Adam Smith
reminded us, all professions are greedy and a threat, none more so than
the legal profession if only because of its importance. Moreover, the
business of the law is archaic, and proudly so. Its majesty is not to be
protected by old-boy networks, wigs, silver buckles, and fancy dress but
only by high standards, transparent procedures, and absolute integrity.
It cannot serve the people by serving itself.
The answer, then, to the age-old question ''Who guards the
guardians?'' has to be disinterested peers from outside the profession,
perhaps in an upper house of legislature, perhaps a senate of wise men
and women. The law must be out of reach of parliament but not above it.
And parliament itself? It thinks itself above the law, and that will not
do either. Parliamentary power, like all power, is corrupting and needs
to be curbed. Fixed-term parliaments and proportional representation
would be a start. Those who argue for strong government should study
their history.
The just society, therefore, looks more like a federation of small
self-governing states than a large centralised bureaucracy of any kind.
But while small is beautiful it is also vulnerable. Scotland please
note. Every act of federalist devolution has to be matched by a
contribution to the federation's law enforcement. Overwhelming force is
the guarantee of law at all levels and there must be no short-changing
here. The price of peace was always eternal vigilance. If the good are
not stronger than the bad, then we are lost.
The other justification of the large state was its mechanical and
economic efficiency, but in the global market this is now irrelevant.
The wellbeing of the individual is less protected by government than by
purchasing power and it is obvious to most that Bodyshop, Sainsburys,
and Marks &amp; Spencer, to name but a few, have done more to protect the
consumer and the environment than any centralised government.
Another bulwark of the just society is its ability to access
information, by radio, television, fax, video, multimedia, in real time
or in our time.
Information systems are the embryonic nervous system of a one-world
federation of small, manageable nations, regions, cities, towns, and
villages. Politics is information. The pain of one village in Rwanda is
felt with the same intensity in Moscow, Beijing, or Stornoway. Never
again shall we be able to hide behind the excuse that we did not know.
The corollary is that while information should be freely available it
must also be true. ''The truth shall set you free,'' says the King James
version but, as philosophers continue to remind us, the truth is not a
simple matter. We may not always know the truth but we can invariably
detect a lie. Deadly enemies of a just society are those who tell lies
and those who would deny others access to the truth.
This is now near the heart of the matter. Every established
organisation, every industry, every political party, and every religion
seeks to preserve itself and its power to coerce others by claiming a
monopoly of the truth.
We hallow the accumulation of custom, prejudice, and practice by
calling it tradition and we must worry about those who seek to
manipulate these beliefs for selfish purposes. There are three main
kinds of culprit. First there are those in the information business;
newspapers, television networks, and pressure groups. Operators in these
fields need to be disinterested in their judgments and transparent in
their actions. They are seldom either. Private ownership of the media
and overt campaigns are not in the public interest and need to be
overseen by other, independent bodies. There is no justification for the
gutter press, for frenzied television, and for systematic half-truths by
pressure groups and others.
The second kind of culprit is government. It shamelessly justifies
means by ends and seeks every excuse to disguise its affairs, its
failures, and its negotiations. Cabinet responsibility has come to mean
secret arrangements. A Freedom of Information Act would be welcome, as
would the repeal of the Official Secrets Act. There is no room in the
just society for secretiveness. The truth cannot harm good government,
but lies immediately undermine its credibility.
Thirdly, and most painfully, is the possessive nature of religious
truths. In every religion all revelations are heresy except those safely
in the past. Yet every day there are new understandings of the world we
live in and new insights into human behaviour. All these wonders are
compatible with the truths of old taken in their context. ''I am the
way, the light, and the truth'' belongs to all religions, but we know
and we should fear the vested interests of existing churches which will
have none of it. I do believe that goodness must prevail. I do believe
that we must search after righteousness. I do believe that most
churchmen would welcome coming together. But the theory of shocks tells
us this will not happen except by catastrophe. I wish I knew how big
that catastrophe has to be.
To survive, a just society has three requirements. The first is to
satisfy its material needs. Technology has shown us how, provided we act
sensibly. The second is to establish our identities, to know and love
ourselves. Liberal democracy has paved the way for this and there are
now no political obstacles to live and let live. The third is to enlarge
the human spirit without denying others. This last requirement may take
another millennium or a final war to rinse out religious prejudice. It
is not certain that humankind can surmount this barrier, but we must
pray that it can.
For those with smaller ambitions there are smaller battles to be
fought. A just society has to be a fair society as well. Even a rich,
educated, and confident society that is not also fair cannot be a just
society. Gross disparities of incomes, opportunities, lifestyles and
basic necessities weaken the cohesiveness of society. Without cohesion
and fellow feeling there can be no society at all.
The redistribution of resources is therefore a matter of great
practical importance. Party politics is about nothing else. Liberal
democracy is the only ideology to have survived the conflicts of the
present millennium. It presumes fairness and the protection of the poor
and weak from coercion by the rich and powerful. The instrument of power
sharing is taxation and we should be pleased and grateful when we pay
taxes to and for good government. Taxes must, of course, be fair and
dodgers should be punished. Taxes must be carefully harvested and well
spent, in clearly understood ways.
The good society should know where its money comes from and where it
goes. Money is not a dirty word. It once described offerings to deities
and it should be treated with respect. It is the life blood of the
transactions of all societies, and not least of the just society. The
common currency, the single European Bank and the International Monetary
Fund are each expressions of the importance of dealing carefully and
openly with money.
The constraints imposed by these legal and financial frameworks are
for the protection of the individual, of the weak from the strong, of
the small from the big. Only that way can we be free. Once these
frameworks are in place, being continuously revised, refreshed, and
reformed, they will represent the social environment of the just society
in which the individual can flourish.
Even within the free and just society forces will be at work to
diminish our rights and privileges. The most threatening force will be
change, the results of which are seldom easy to predict, and which may
or may not be to our advantage. Where we can insure against accidents
and prepare prudently for disasters, epidemics, and famines, we do.
However, if a beneficial invention replaces the light bulb by a laser or
the gramophone by a laser disc then those developing the invention will
be greatly advantaged over those whose technology has been eclipsed.
Already, changing technologies have cut a swathe through our early
societies of labour-intensive, older industries. We see, even in the
good societies of the 1990s, that unemployment is high and seemingly
permanent. This unwanted consequence of the industrial revolution that
still embraces us is the newest threat to social stability, human
happiness and, therefore, to the just society.
While casual unemployment is inevitable, high structural unemployment
is not. It is a sin against humankind, most of the members of which see
work not just as a meal ticket or a place to go. It is a
near-sacramental act of justifying our lives to ourselves, to our
partners, and to our children. .
Work is an essential ingredient of life. Not everyone wants to work
relentlessly to improve themselves or their families but at a basic
level we all want to work. Once we agree that this is so then we can
take appropriate measures, as some countries have done already. The
entry of the young into the workplace can be delayed. The retiral of
those who have done their stint can be accelerated. Longer holidays,
shorter working weeks, and job creation must be switched on and paid
for. The equations of cost effectiveness must include the costs of
unemployment and of its resulting social deprivations, and need not
interfere with markets and market forces.
Full employment and fair wages are therefore staples of the just
society, but are not sufficient in themselves. Two other divisive
factors must be dealt with. The first has to do with education. Britain
is a class-conscious society, England more so than Scotland.
Nevertheless, in both countries there are attitudes of mind which
incline towards old models of society and past political positions.
Those with a cloth-cap or blue-collar image of themselves have low
expectations. They perform less well at school and their futures are
blighted. There then lurks the prospect of an underclass unwilling and
unable to meet the challenges of the free and just society.
Good education is the solution and always has been. It is Scotland's
strength. What then should we do to ensure our people develop their
talents to the full?
For this to happen education itself must change. It must become more
inviting and less excluding, more enjoyable and more motivating. Its
purpose is human development, not grading, and in the interests of the
student customer rather than those of the teacher provider. The key to
this revolution is also to be found in new technology. The individual
multimedia experience, the personalising of student progress and the
replacement of academic attitudes and targets by more creative learning
apprenticeships are there for the asking. Left to do their best, these
learning technologies will transform education. And the rhetorical
question -- ''If education is good for you, why is it compulsory?'' will
attract the honest answer -- ''Because we make it difficult, and
unnecessarily so.''
The most important part of education is the beginning. No better
investment can ever be made than in educating and training the very
young. They will repay all the resources put into nursery and primary
schooling. The teachers must be the best and therefore the best paid.
Their role is vital, as life-long role models and as inspiring masters
of the arts of learning and doing. We cannot easily wipe away the bad
habits of centuries but we could quite quickly bring out the best in
every child. The child that is well regarded becomes the good citizen,
the main defender of the just society. The child that is unloved becomes
the thief and the psychopath.
In this context the idea of segregated schools is abhorrent. Freedom
to pursue one's religion is essential but to prejudice the young is
wrong. This is that second divisive factor. While it cannot be
proscribed it should not be publicly supported.
So the just society, like the open society, has many enemies, but the
times are against these foes. Their disparate natures are no match for
the collective wisdom of a world increasingly aware of its holistic
powers and responsibilities. Two great engines are at work on our
behalf; the universal demand for higher quality and the force of global
opinion. These can be used for good or for ill, and care must be taken
to prevent the large from overwhelming the small. Democracy can make
mistakes. It can also make hard decisions harder still.
So we can report some progress towards the just society. Only war can
keep us from greater progress still. The seven deadly sins are still
around, even in the family, but they are less fun than they were. A land
flowing with milk and honey? Sure thing. Heaven on earth? Not yet.

CASH-strapped Chris Robinson faced George Fulston over the poker table
last night and splashed #1m on winning Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies.
The two premier-division rivals have been involved in a week-long
struggle for Jefferies and Falkirk chairman Fulston's five-year contract
bid seemed to have cleaned up.
However, last night his Hearts counterpart Robinson slapped a rival
five-year deal on the table to match the Brockville ace, as the game
slipped into green baize mode.
Although there is little up-front cash involved in this audacious move
by Robinson to avoid a humiliating rejection, the long-term commitment
to the kitty is inescapable.
Former manager Tommy McLean's legal advisers are confident that his
shock dismissal last Friday will bring them in excess of #200,000 in
court with interest and costs.
Should Fulston, who has offered his manager a further day to decide,
loses this all-too-public game, he will be seeking similar compensation
for Jefferies and his assistant, Billy Brown.
If Robinson's hand prevails, McLean's assistant Eamonn Bannon will
make way, with Hearts picking up the tab for the remaining two years of
his contract and, finally, Robinson will be looking to find some
#500,000 in salaries for the Jefferies/Brown partnership which has taken
Falkirk from the first division to the top half of the premier in five
years.
Meanwhile, Jefferies was preparing for another sleepless night,
choosing between the club he has supported all his life, and the one
that helped him make the big time.
''There is no problem on my part with the terms on either side but I
want to see the Hearts proposals in writing before making a choice,'' he
said.
''It's going to be a desperate decision to make but I would like to
stress that these offers and counter offers have not been sought by
me.''
Without this latest intervention by the Edinburgh club, they were big
outsiders to scoop the pool but last night even money appeared an
accurate call.
Meanwhile, Bannon and coach Walter Kidd travelled with a bemused squad
to the Highlands yesterday where they met Peterhead last night before
playing Elgin City and Montrose over the weekend.

* Would any of your experts be able to say how capital gains are taxed
if they are made on shareholdings held overseas? I ask this because I
have the opportunity to invest funds which are banked abroad and this
could be a better bet than investing in the UK market.
* An individual who is UK resident for part of a fiscal year or
ordinarily resident for the whole year is liable to UK capital gains tax
on gains made in the UK or abroad. If the person is not domiciled in the
UK he or she will only be taxed on the amount received here.
The question of whether the gains would be taxed abroad would depend
on the rules applying to that country, but it would be unusual for a
liability to arise even where you do not live in the country. If it
does, the UK has agreements with many countries to avoid double taxation
of income or gains. Generally speaking, capital gains arising to UK
residents will be taxed here and not abroad, but if they are taxed in
both countries provision will be made to obtain credit for the foreign
tax paid against the UK liability.

* I am self-employed and I am not satisfied with the treatment I am
getting at my local Social Security office in respect of my contribution
record. Can you tell me how I go about complaining to a higher
authority?
* Assuming you have got nowhere with the head of your Contributions
Agency office, you should first write to the chief executive of the
agency in Newcastle (Room C1837, Contributions Agency, Longbenton,
Newcastle NE98 1YX). Only if this does not satisfy you, should you
complain to the offical adjudicator for the agency, the Inland Revenue
and Customs and Excise, Elizabeth Filkin. However, she cannot act on
disputes relating to matters of law. These have to go to the Secretary
of State for Social Security, Peter Lilley.
In any complaint you should set out your case in as much detail as you
can, including dates and names of people spoken to. You can telephone
the adjudicator's office on 0171 930 2292 for advice on this if
required. The adjudicator will want to know exactly what you would like
the Contributions Agency to do. You should also give an estimate of
expenses you have incurred so far, such as stamps, transport costs and
telephone charges.
The adjudicator listens to both sides in the dispute and makes a
formal recommendation to the agency about how the case should be
resolved, which will not necessarily be in your favour. The agency is
not bound to follow the recommendation though in practice it almost
always does. If it doesn't, this is noted in the adjudicator's annual
report, so ensuring maximum publicity is given to it.
There is a further course of action you can take and that is
complaining to the Parliamentary ombudsman, which has to be done through
your MP. You can request this without going first to the adjudicator,
though this would be inadvisable in most cases, and can also do so after
she has delivered her ruling.
* My wife and I are 65 years of age and retired. My wife has an
estimated income of #4450 from state pension, superannuation, building
societies, and shares. I pay tax at the 25% rate. The mortgage on the
house has been cleared and we are satisfied that our annual income from
various sources is sufficient.
My wife has 900 BT shares, 1000 British Gas, #8000 in building society
three-year bonds at 8.5%, and #21,000 in two building society postal
accounts. I have 900 BT shares, 1300 ScottishPower and 500 Anglian
Water. We also have a joint #3000 Save and Prosper PEP and a joint
#30,000 Scottish Provident capital investment bond which terminates in
two years. None of the privatised shares are in PEPs and I would
appreciate your advice on whether they should be, or would it perhaps be
more beneficial to change some or all of them into investment trust
PEPs?
* There are two aspects of your financial arrangements which we do not
like. The first and most obvious is that your directly held equity
investments are all in privatisation stocks, and as you both hold BT
shares you are heavily dependent on the performance of this one company.
Second, the #30,000 you have invested in the capital investment bond
is excessive in relation to your total resources, which amount to just
under #80,000. Investment bonds are inferior financial vehicles to unit
and investment trusts, and the practice of investing large sums in these
breaks one of the golden rules of investment, not to put too many eggs
into one basket.
If you switch some or all of your privatisation stocks into investment
trusts it is likely to result in a reduction in income, since these
funds tend to put the emphasis on capital rather than income growth. For
this reason they should prove good hedges against inflation, which over
time can turn out to be the biggest threat to nest eggs upon which
retired people depend.
Personal equity plans hold more attractions for you than your wife,
since she seems unlikely to have much of a tax liability. But even in
your case you will have to watch that your savings on income tax are not
eaten up by management charges.
Incidentally, you cannot have a joint PEP as you say you have. They
must be individually held, and you and your wife are each able to put
#6000 per annum into a general PEP and a further #3000 into a single
company one.
A thorough review of your portfolio should be possible once your
capital bond matures in two years, that is if you do not decide to
dispose of it before then. Meanwhile, we would advise you to consult a
good stockbroker -- the Stock Exchange in Glasgow can, if necessary,
supply a list -- on the best use of your funds, which are by no means
inconsequential.
Depending on when you bought them, you may have done well out of your
privatisation stocks (with the exception of ScottishPower which has
hardly provided its shareholders with a bonanza so far), but the
regulatory process is becoming increasingly tough. Too great a
dependence on utilities is, therefore, to be avoided.
* I note that building societies are having a tough time with the
depressed housing market. Also the new rules relating to the payment of
mortgage interest for unemployed people by Social Security are likely to
mean higher repossessions. I am wondering about the security of smaller
societies. Would one actually be allowed to go under as a sort of
warning to others to be more prudent?
I have accounts with several small societies partly in the hope of
some windfall profits should one be take over. Meanwhile, they are
paying higher interest than the larger societies.
* Small building societies will never be as cast iron as the household
names, but it is unlikely that one would actually be allowed to go bust.
For the good name of the industry another society would rally round and
take it over, safeguarding savers' funds.
The Building Societies Association has always ensured in the past that
this would happen. With the whole idea of mutuality under pressure, with
more societies opting to become companies, it would be even less likely
to allow any society to go under. Many small societies are a tiny
fraction of the size of the majors, so the cost to the rescuer would be
small, given that there would be no premium for purchase.
However, it would still be unwise to leave large sums with smaller
societies. The compensation is limited to 90% of deposits of up to
#20,000, so you should definitely not exceed this figure per society.
Incidentally, the small societies are arguably less likely to be taken
over. They can command local loyalty and the expenses of purchase make
them relatively poor value. There will always be room for such niche
players in the market.

THERE has always been some uncertainty over feeding levels for plants,
especially ornamentals.
No-one would disagree that inducing vegetables to grow to their
maximum is generally desirable, but it can be a different matter with
feeding levels for flowering and fruiting items. Ornamental cherries can
take several years after being planted in a rich soil to settle down to
a flowering sequence.
Many bedding plants can be a little tricky if over-fed. Nasturtiums
will romp away merrily and produce masses of leaves and very few
flowers. The same is true of petunias.
All growing plants have definite nutrient requirements for the main
three elements -- nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash.
Many shrubs, and particularly trees, have intensive rooting systems,
so there is seldom any need to feed them. The roots will search out
moisture and nutrients over a wide area.
With short-term bedding plants, getting the balance right is the
problem. The popular way of feeding nowadays is in liquid form. Remember
the basic rules: nitrogen encourages leaf growth, phosphorus encourages
root and fruit growth, potassium tends to act as a regulator of growth
and enhances colour.
There are lots of other elements with a role to play, such as
magnesium and iron, but most are included in liquid feeds.
Assess whether plants make enough leaf growth. If so, use a balanced
liquid feed with equal amounts of N, P and K. If leaf size is small and
not of good colour, add a feed that is high in nitrogen.

* WITH more than half-a-century of experience in the gardening
business, I should know what not to grow in my garden, but I still get
things wrong.
This year I have a typical example. I am very keen on annuals produced
from direct sowing, and I put a range of seeds into borders in late
April and early May.
At first there was good germination, but it was from that attractive
and energetic plant rightly named forget-me-not, or myosotis to give it
its proper name, which I hadn't actually sowed out.
It is a hardy bi-annual, with seed sown one year for the next, and I
can remember planting out a few to complement spring bulbs a few years
ago.
It must be the seed crop from these which has come up in profusion.
But how am I going to get rid of them?
Perhaps the best solution is to leave things as they are, cultivate
the ground thoroughly, and sow all the annuals in the greenhouse for
planting out in May.
By that time, surface hoeing or persistent hand-weeding will take care
of next year's crop of these seedlings.

Aileen Little finds that alotting space to medicinal plants was one of
the main reasons for setting up large gardens.
IT'S often forgotten that the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
started out in 1670 as a collection of more than 1000 plants for
medicinal purposes. ''It taught apothecaries how to identify plants and
how to mix herbal remedies,'' says David Rae, the Garden's horticultural
training officer and conservation co-ordinator.
Coincidentally, David is overseeing the gradual renovation and renewal
of St Mary's Pleasance, a reproduction physic garden in Haddington, East
Lothian. Part of a 17th-century Scottish lookalike garden behind
Haddington House, in a spot known as St Mary's Pleasance, the physic
garden takes the form of a sunken parterre.
It was designed -- as was the four-acre site as a whole -- by Sir
George Taylor, an Edinburgh man and a former director of Kew who retired
to East Lothian.
''He modelled the physic garden on the Queen's Garden he designed at
Kew. His friendship with the late Duke of Hamilton encouraged the Duke
to purchase the historic ground and set up a trust to administer it,''
says David, who took over the job of chairman of the board of trustees
after Sir George's death.
The physic garden, which boasts 15 species of aromatic and medicinal
herbs, is open to the public daily and is made especially interesting by
the addition of labels quoting from John Gerrard's Herball or General
Historie of Plantes, first published in 1597.
Sage, for example ''strengthneth the sinewes'' and is commended
against the spitting of blood. The combined minds of Pliny, Dioscorides
and Plutarch agreed that rue ''quickens the sight'' when ''a little
boiled or skolded and kept in pickle'', and feverfew is ''very good for
them that are giddie in the head''.
Gerrard reckoned ailments afflicting everything from ''ruptures,
cornes and joynts to madness and cherry-cheeked winches'' could be
remedied by a drop of the green stuff. And, as David points out, many
such plants are still seriously regarded for their health-giving
properites.
But herbalism must be used with caution. ''We have signs telling
people not to try out the remedies. Many medicines use minute quantities
of poisonous plants.''
David, who recently moved from Haddington to Edinburgh, is hard at
work designing his own physic garden.
''I like the shape of formal gardens, but with informal planting
inside them. I'm creating a small parterre with edges of box, globe
artichokes, lavender and rosemary. I plan to put a square pond in the
centre.''
A garden like this, he maintains, can be made low-maintenance by using
perennial herbaceous plants like chives and purple sage as ground cover.
''I'm going to mix in Christmas roses, thyme, and several types of
variegated mint.''

* A SCOT has come up with a new concept in greenhouses based on the
design of the original North American Indian tipi.
Andrew McIntyre's Backwoodsman operation outside Oban even uses the
same spelling as the Indians -- tipi. The word is from the Siouan
language, and means ''used for dwelling''. Andrew's factory outside Oban
builds three sizes of GrowMates.
''The North American Indian bit came when I realised that tipis had
proved very habitable as far north as Hudson Bay,'' says Andrew.
''The Indians kept their tipis stable with a circle of boulders on the
hide cover turned in at the base. A bit of testing found that a raised
bed of compost inside did the same for my GrowMate.
''The compost bed absorbed warmth in the sun and radiated it out
later. Along with the plants inside, it evaporates moisture and cools
the entire structure.
''The octagonal glass top rotates to give full access to the GrowMate
through just one opening. The top is misaligned with the base, allowing
for ventilation slots, which means cool air comes in at the bottom, and
as it becomes warm it rises and flows out of the top.''
''It is,'' he adds, ''very easy to keep heating costs right down over
winter. Would you believe the equivalent in electricity of
one-and-a-half light bulbs, or a gallon or paraffin a month?''
The stability of the GrowMate means it can be placed on rooftop
gardens, unlike a normal greenhouse, and it is completely portable, so
if you decide to move you can simply take it with you.
The GrowMates come in three sizes, the Standard is 5ft in diameter and
5ft in height, the Mini 4ft by 4ft and the Baby, which is ideal for
balconies, measures 2ft by 4ft. They cost #399, #349 and #199, including
glass, plus a delivery of charge of #35.
Before he set up his factory outside Oban six years ago, Andrew ran a
wood-burning stove and heating consultancy business. He handed that over
to his wife, Susan, when he decided to produce the GrowMate himself.
He now runs a highly successful business selling around 300 units a
year, and employs five people, including his elder son Tim, an engineer.
Andrew goes to most of the larger horticultural shows to exhibit the
GrowMates, as the company has no stockists as yet. The Oban factory is
busy at the moment meeting deadlines on orders from the Hampton Court
Show, the Chelsea Show and the Highland Show at Ingliston.
South-east England seems a favourite buying area, possibly because
land prices are so high and people have to garden on little space.
People write to Andrew saying they can grow pretty well anything in
his glass pyramids -- cuttings, plants, alpines, tomatoes, you name it.
''The only problem is that 'serious growers' seem to think they're
just a showcase for pretty plants,'' says Andrew. ''Actually, nothing
could be further from the truth. Everything grows well. Ask anyone who's
tried them.''

* THE recent furore about surfinia petunias being affected by a
crippling viral disease highlighted the role viruses have to play in the
plant world.
I doubt whether any plant is completely free from viruses, although
many damaging ones have been successfully eliminated. Sereral viruses
don't make their presence known.
Typical symptoms can be seen on many plants. Dahlias are well-known as
being readily infected. The late John Granger, a plant pathologist at
the West of Scotland Agricultural College, spent a large part of his
life attempting to remove these diseases, and he was remarkably
successful.
Tomatoes can be host to many viruses, notably mosaic virus. In its
mild forms, it doesn't seem to affect cropping too much but there are
more serious diseases.
One well-known one is reversion disease, which affects blackcurrants.
It is spread by the big bud mite, and once it gets a real grip, it can
reduce fruiting potential considerably.
There are scientists all round the world working on control of viral
diseases. The ironic thing is that, for every virus conquered, others
arise.
There is not a lot the average gardener can do, apart from buying
clean stock in the first place. Another thing is to control sucking
pests, the main cause of virus spread.
This can be caused by merely holding a virus-infected plant, and once
a sound plant is badly infected and shows signs of severe debility,
there is little point in keeping it.
You can generally be sure that there will be stunting, leaf mottling
and other related symptoms to indicate onset of the disease. If you are
really concerned, seek specialist help from the Scottish Agricultural
College or another scientific body.

* YOU HAVE just come back from holiday and with some apprehension you
view the garden.
If you had a minder in, things may not be too bad, but if you let the
garden take pot luck, chances are you have overgrown lawns and edges,
and floppy plants and weeds in the vegetable section. Plus a possible
disaster with the tomatoes.
Sometimes mowers can't cope with holiday hangovers. Rotary ones can be
remarkably efficient for long grass, but when the grass is sheared it
takes some time to recover. Watering may help, especially if the weather
is exceptionally hot and dry.
Using some of the new nitrogen-based lawn fertilisers could also be a
good idea. Apply them in the cool of the evening or in the early
morning.
As for weeds in the vegetable section, there is nothing for it but to
get down to a bit of pulling. Once you get a reasonable level of
control, you can go back to hoeing again.
There should be plenty of vegetables to use, especially early turnips,
lettuce, calabrese, peas and possibly broad beans, with French beans
coming along.
Whether your tomatoes are past redemption depends on the watering in
your absence. At all events, strip off a proportion of leaves --
undoubtedly yellowing -- give plenty of water, and hopefully things may
recover.
Groups of pot plants in a shady corner of the house may have gone
lanky. When restored to their normal positions, you may find some
trimming is needed.
Plants left in the bath with wet feet have probably got some yellow on
their leaves and these should be coaxed back to a healthy colour by some
liquid fertiliser.
As a bonus, there should still be raspberries to pick, followed by
blackcurrants. As for roses, there will be spent blooms to remove. It is
a good idea to give some general fertiliser to encourage strong new
growth.

ONCE your home cinema is set up, your local video shop becomes the
gateway to a bright new world of entertainment, and you will find that
you want to retain many of the classic films in your own library.
A must-have VHS tape is the widescreen edition of Forbidden Planet, a
sci-fi reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest, made in 1956 in
spectacular Cinemascope. A disc-full of astronauts, led by Leslie
Nielsen, land on a planet populated by scientist Walter Pidgeon, his
daughter, and Robby the Robot.
The special collector's edition, with original trailer, sells in a
collector's pack at #12.99, and is suitable for family viewing.
In the same Beyond Vision series, this time with surround sound, are
Batman and Batman Returns, both with hugely entertaining soundtracks.
This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Jaws, which earned three
Oscars and entered the annals of pop culture. This classic film's
award-winning score still conjures up a sense of dread, and a widescreen
edition is now available on VHS.
It will be interesting to see how Shallow Grave is regarded in 20
years. Chances are this Scottish black comedy, directed by Danny Boyle
and with a stunning soundtrack, will be in every collector's library.
Shallow Grave is now out on rental.

* ONE day somebody is going to deliver a learned paper entitled ''The
Video Rental Shop as a Catalyst of Latent Function in late 20th Century
Scottish Communities'' and, whatever it means, it should be interesting.
Take the village nearest to us. I'd just love to see what the
itinerant sociologist -- clipboard, stopwatch, serious glasses and all
-- would make of it.
There are around 10 shops in the village and more than half of them
rent videos.
At the butcher's you can buy pork chops and rent Chainsaws a-Go-Go; at
the less-than-supermarket you can buy dried suet and rent Four
Swamp-Things and a Chainsaw; at the booze shop you can buy Mateus Rose,
and some still do, and rent The Great Chainsaw Robbery; at the newspaper
shop . . . No need to continue. I'm sure you get the picture, if not the
entire tape.
There's another paper to be written, I'm sure, on ''The Symbolic
Importance of the Chainsaw in the Contemporary Home Entertainment
Repertoire''.
All this videotape ubiquity sows confusion in the mind of the average
renter. Here -- word-for-word but expletives deleted -- are the minutes
of a conversation in this very house this very week.
''What did you get?''
''Er, Batman and the Bonnie Prince Charlie Chainsaw Case.''
''Idiot. We've seen it twice already.''
''In two words -- im-possible. I've never rented a video from the
ironmonger's before. And I'm positive I've never seen this
illustration.'' (Show video box with picture of Bonnie Prince Charlie,
fangs slavering, advancing on Batman with a roaring chainsaw while
Batman, well-hung in a plastic spray-on Batsuit, considers his options.)
''Listen. They change the illustrations every few months to catch out
people like you. Ah well, let's see it . . . again.''
Sure enough, the story did seem strangely familiar: but if you've paid
the ironmonger #3.50 there's no point in wasting the money.
Next day, as he took back his tape, the ironmonger asked: ''Enjoy
it?''
Not a bit, I said, plus which I'd seen it before. ''Happens all the
time,'' he said happily.
So I asked him the sociological question. Why, given that he's
supposed to be an ironmonger, does he rent videos?
''Easy one, that,'' he said. ''Look at all these (gestures towards the
chainsaw-swollen racks). I can take any tape home at any time and watch
it for free. It's an escape from ironmongery.''
And, I asked, the butcher, the booze shop, the newsagent? ''The
same,'' he said. ''In fact we go round to each other's houses when one
of us has a new tape in stock. It's a sort of village art cinema club.''
So that was the answer. But anyway, I'd come in for a packet of
half-inch carpet tacks. ''Sorry,'' he said. ''I sold the last this
morning.'' Not a note of regret in his voice either.

She shall have music wherever she goes: and with the new portable
Sharp CD-changer WQ-CH950H, youngsters can tune into the cult long-wave
radio station all around the home and in the garden, too.
YOU can invest in the best in hi-fi, and turn the living room into a
veritable home cinema, but chances are the younger members of the family
will be in their room or out in the garden, listening to the radio or
playing their favourite discs/tapes on their personal stereo or
ghetto-blaster.
Sound quality may not be their prime consideration. First questions
are likely to be: Can I pump up the volume? Can I boost the bass?
However, these days portable music machines are a far cry from the
tinny trannies of a generation ago, with high-quality signals from FM
radio stations and disc-reading lasers, and with Dolby circuits removing
tape hiss.
There's just one problem...
For many youngsters these days, there's only one radio station to tune
in to, and that's Atlantic 252 -- on long wave. But until 252 came along
it was only fuddy-duddy Radio Four listeners who needed long wave, so
nobody thought of including the band in radios aimed at the pop market.
You won't find LW on any Walkman, though Sony do have a couple of
portable radios with the band -- the ICF490L at #19,99, and the ICF790L
at #24.00.
Full marks to Sharp, who have just brought out a teenager-friendly
portable machine with a five-disc CD changer designed to deliver up to
six hours of non-stop music, a twin cassette deck, bass-booster, graphic
equaliser, infra-red remote control, and . . . yes, a radio with long
wave and short wave. Called the WQ-CH950H, it is priced at #199.99.

Magazines often sing the praises of one set of black boxes over
another, but Johanna Hall advises listening before any notes change
hands.
FOR most people, buying a new hi-fi is a major purchase and one which
can be quite baffling to say the least. Walk into most department or
electrical stores and there are rows and rows of black, sleek-looking
boxes with varying amounts of flashing lights, dials and buttons . . .
all with different prices on and sometimes a sharp salesman on hand (if
you're lucky) to bamboozle you with facts and figures, not to mention
prices.
Alan Gibb owns Stereo Stereo in St Vincent Street in Glasgow, and we
talked about how to go about buying a system from a sofa in a sitting
room. There was hardly a black box in sight. Alan thinks people have
certain things on their mind when they go to buy a hi-fi.
''The biggest fear most folk have is that they don't get the best
value for their money or that they buy something which, in the long run,
will disappoint them. A lot of folk will have bought a magazine, but
there are hundreds of companies making thousands of models.
''A lot of folk who are writing about this equipment are trying to
describe music with words, so you get really crazy, weird nonsense.
People are reading about how this kind of speaker has a very dry
mid-range. I wonder what a wet mid-range sounds like!''
So perhaps you can't rely on magazines, and if you ask a friend they
are probably going to recommend the unit they have. Well they would,
wouldn't they? The way Alan Gibb goes about selling his equipment is so
obvious it's novel.
''What you do is just play stuff for people. It's best to hear the
difference between two CD players rather than saying this one has extra
buttons on it and such-and-such a feature, the most important thing is
to work out whether you are going to listen to it.''
Hence the sitting-room atmosphere in his showroom, and the number of
different-sized rooms ranging from a small bedroom to a West End
lounge-sized room.
Some people, however, may worry about telling the difference between
good sound and bad sound. Alan says not to worry. ''It's like having a
glass of beer, you don't have to make beer to know if you enjoy it or
not.''
Preconceived ideas can be a problem, however. ''Most people try to
work out how much they are going to buy before they have even listened
to anything. Don't worry about the technical ins and outs, have a listen
first.''
In Stereo Stereo, equipment is perhaps not the cheapest you can find,
but the quality is there. As to whether the more you pay the better the
system gets, it will depend on the individual.
Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between a #400 CD player
and a #600 one, but perhaps someone would hear a big difference. As to
how much people will pay, there is a system made by Linn, a Scottish
company, for #20,000. If this is a bit beyond your budget, then perhaps
you don't want to start with a complete system (turntable, CD, tape,
tuner . . . the works).
However, you might consider buying ''separates'' and build up your
system slowly. There are three main components to the hi-fi: the source
(CD, radio, radio tuner, etc) the control systems (base, treble, balance
etc) and playback (amplifier and speakers).
Sometimes folk put their money in the wrong place, says Alan. ''People
think that the most important thing is the speakers because the sound is
coming out of them. The best way to describe it is by analogy, like if
you buy a telly. You can buy the best telly in the world and if you are
in a bad reception area, and use an indoor aerial, you will get a rotten
picture.
''You would be better buying the next model down and an outside
aerial. The same thing is true of a hi-fi system, you have to get the
music, so the most important thing is the source component, CD or
whatever. You have to get it right or all the amplifier will do is make
the mistake louder.''
No matter where you go to buy your system take your time, go back and
listen more than once. Take your own music to listen to as you will be
used to the sounds and it may be easier to make listening comparisons.

ANDREAS Thom, of Bayer Leverkusen, yesterday became the player who did
not get away from Celtic. Manager Tommy Burns finally got his man when
the 29-year-old German international striker walked into Parkhead and
signed a three-year contract which, according to the club's chief
executive, Fergus McCann, will cost #4m over that period.
Burns is convinced that his signing activity is not yet over, saying
that he could have two more new men in his squad before the start of the
season.
Around 1000 Celtic fans waited in the rain outside the ground as the
deal -- the transfer fee was #2.2m -- was completed, and Thom, capped 51
times by the old East Germany and 11 times by the unified German team,
revealed that a last-gasp bid by another top club failed to tempt him.
Through his agent, who acted as interpreter, the player said: ''One of
the biggest clubs in Germany (believed to be Werder Bremen) made me an
offer only yesterday, but my mind was made up. My wife and I are
delighted to be coming to Scotland and to a club of such stature as
Celtic.
''It is always a big challenge for a player to move to another
country, and it is a challenge I want. Of course, I want to continue to
play for the German national side, but that will happen only if I play
well for Celtic.
''In 1986 I played against Aberdeen and that's when I learned about
the fantastic atmosphere in Scotland. I think the Celtic fans are the
best in the country and I will be putting my all into making this a
successful season for both them and the club. I'm really looking forward
to playing in front of those great fans for the first time.''
That will almost certainly happen next Saturday, when Celtic return to
the new Parkhead to play against Newcastle United. Thom will not be on
duty when the team travels to Birmingham today, or south again next
Tuesday, when they face Everton at Goodison Park.
Said manager Burns: ''Andreas and his wife have had a hectic time over
the last four or five days. I think it is important that they get back
to Germany to say goodbye to their friends and attend to other business.
I expect him back at Celtic Park next week and I think it's important he
makes his debut for Celtic in front of our own fans, probably against
Newcastle.
''Andreas is a very mature, very quick front player, who can also
operate in the midfield. He is also a good family man, who has his
priorities right.
''But he has not come here as some kind of saviour. We hope to bring
in another couple of new men quickly to help him, and, of course, we
already have other quality players at the club.
''It's the biggest signing the club has ever made, and when you sign
someone of his standing in the game, it should help others to want to
come here. I am very happy for all those people standing out there in
the rain and for the other Celtic fans who have been disappointed.''
Celtic finally got the quick, front player they wanted after having
been turned down by other international stars, including Belgian Marc
Degryse and Frenchman David Ginola. They also lost Dundee United
defender Gordan Petric to Rangers, with United chairman Jim McLean
accusing someone from inside Celtic Park of leaking confidential
information about the negotiation.
All McCann would say about that yesterday was: ''Mr McLean has not
given me the courtesy of a reply as to why he made those accusations. I
think it is improper and that he should be held accountable for it. You
can draw your own conclusions. But we don't do business that way.''
McCann also revealed that Celtic Park will have a capacity of 31,000
for the Newcastle match. He said: ''We are delighted with the progress
of the work achieved by Miller Construction, so much so that we have
invited the 300 workers on the project to attend the game as guests of
the club in recognition of their good work. An additional 3340 seats
will be opened before the first competetive match, which may be on
August 30.''
Meantime, manager Burns said that both Phil O'Donnell and Tom Boyd,
who went on the tour of Germany with the club but did not play because
they were recovering from injuries, would get a run at some stage of
this afternoon's match against Birmingham City.
John Collins has been pinpointed by Birmingham manager Barry Fry as
the Celtic danger man. Fry said: ''Everyone down here knows about the
player. He's very much talked about and admired. The lad is a very
gifted and talented player.
''Then again, I suppose anyone who's good enough to play for a team
like Celtic must have some quality.''
My wife and I are delighted to be coming to Scotland and to a club of
such stature as Celtic.

Sound thinking is producing big screen effects on the living room.
HANDS up all those who hid behind the sofa when the dastardly Daleks
trundled on to the scene. The family television in those days was
probably a small-screen, black-and-white model with a tiny, tinny
loudspeaker.
Now, imagine horror-movie action in vivid colour on a 50in screen with
spine-chilling howl of a werewolf suddenly coming from behind you. There
is nowhere to hide! After decades of steady but fairly undramatic
development in the domestic television set, during which colour became
the norm, and screens became flatter and squarer and could be viewed
without drawing the curtains, home entertainment is being revolutionised
-- and the key element is sound.
However big the screen and bright the colours, the ideal of the home
cinema based on the domestic television receiver was unattainable until
the arrival of surround sound. The gap between Star Trek seen in the
cinema and viewed at home was immense, and the difference was in the
quality and direction of what we could hear. Now spaceships really do
zoom toward you and whoosh across the room, and all the more subtle
shadings of sound add enormously to our appreciation and enjoyment of
everything from blockbusting extravaganza to wildlife documentary.
The technologies that bring cinema-style sound into the home is called
Dolby Surround and Dolby Pro-Logic, which use clever encoding to squeeze
extra information on to a stereo soundtrack. When this is decoded and
delivered through extra speakers -- up to seven can be used -- it
produces sounds of amazing depth and width, filling the room and adding
new perceptions and enhanced entertainment.
The electronics industry had already provided us with a range of
large-screen television sets with conventional cathode ray tubes
stretching to over 30in, boxed-in projection units up to 50in, and even
larger images available when projected onto walls and ceilings.
The arrival of the now-ubiquitous Nicam sets, which can decode stereo
signals, was the essential first step on the road to the true home
cinema. This brought much-improved sound quality, and encouraged greater
amplification and improved speakers. The new surround systems add hi-fi
clarity and volume levels, with floor-shaking sub-woofers for those who
want to really annoy their neighbours.
As in other areas of consumer electronics, such as PCs and computer
games, the range of new models and the speed with which they are
introduced can baffle all but the most dedicated techno-freaks. The
positive aspect of all this competitive ingenuity and activity is that
this is one of the few areas in life where prices, in real terms, do not
inexorably rise.
Let's look at some of the more significant machines now on the market
or about to be introduced.
Most people find the 25in television set, which is becoming the
non-portable norm, is on the small side for home cinema. Nicam 28/29in
sets are becoming popular with the British consumer, and you can pay as
little as #400 for a Goodman's 28in, though you should expect to pay
over #600 to get a quality picture. The Sony KV-X2972 at around #730 is
highly recommended, the Sony KV-G2915 has a built-in satellite receiver,
and the Bang and Olufsen MX 7000 at #1650 has powered external speakers.
If you want to impress your friends, you could opt for a 37in screen,
such as the Grundig M95-775/9, with picture-in-picture, at #2800, or
splurge out on a Panasonic TX37A2G at around #4000.
For the purist film buff, it probably has to be a widescreen
television offering a 19:9 ratio to capture the full impact of modern
cinematography. The number of films available in widescreen format is
limited, but now growing steadily. Widescreen prices range from the 27in
Bush WS5000 at #800, to B&amp;O's flagship, the versatile 28in Beovision
Avant, at #3300, with the award-winning 28in Philips 28W682A in between
at just under #1000. Choosing a projection television, which can turn
Jurassic Park into a mammoth experience, should be undertaken with great
care, for a number of them are just not suitable for domestic use. If
you really want to go for broke, you could look at the Sanyo PLC300MB,
which will fill a 300in screen at a cost of about #10,500.
At the heart of your home cinema system will be a Dolby sound
processor. If you want to use your existing hi-fi system, you can buy an
add-on Pro-Logic processor and connect it to your amplifier to extract
surround sound from all signal sources. Some also supply power for the
centre and rear channels. The Kenwood SS-3300 is a straightforward,
upgradable model for #250. If you spend four times that, you can have
the award-winning Fosgate Model 4 high-end processor.
If you want to replace your existing amp, or are starting from
scratch, you can buy a Dolby Pro-Logic audio video amplifier which will
perform all your home cinema and hi-fi functions. Yamaha has
consistently set the standard for other AV amps to follow, and the
current Pro-Logic champion is their DSP-A2070. At #1,1000, this machine
has provision for front stereo, front effects, rear effects, and two
front centre channels, as well as a sub-woofer output. It also has
multiple video and audio outputs and inputs. Superb sound quality at a
keen price is provided by the #800 Denon AVC-2800, which employs what
the makers call a Dynamic Discrete Surround Circuit.
Perhaps the perfect starter system for the home cinema is the Sony
MHC-901AV Pro-Logic mini system, which for #500 provides a full set of
hi-fi and surround-sound components -- and comes with a set of five
speakers.
When it comes to speakers, the enormous choice can be bewildering. The
novice should perhaps opt for a package of five speakers, or six
including a sub-woofer, from the same manufacturer, to ensure a
well-matched sound. If you are incorporating existing speakers into a
Pro-Logic system, note that the centre one is probably the most
important, and should be magnetically shielded. Dolby surround does not
use a centre speaker. For a good value, no-nonsense sent of five
speakers which perform well in Pro-Logic mode, listen to RA Labs Black
Gold series at #268. The Mission 73 series at #380 is a welcome entry to
the home cinema area, providing an enjoyable experience and a decent
bass without needing a sub-woofer.
If you are the kind of person who loves poring over technical
specifications and compiling fantasy systems from disparate sources
before making a buying decision, then home cinema, with its many
component parts, is sure to get your juices flowing. However, what if
you just want to sit down and enjoy a good movie?
Despair not. Major manufacturers are now bringing to the market
all-in-one Dolby Pro-Logic/Surround television systems, so you can sleep
soundly without nightmare about whether your sub-woofer is incompatible
with your satellite receiver.
Grundig has a formidable surround set of three -- 25in, 27in and 29in
-- priced at #900, #1100 and #1400. The Philips 29828C is outstanding
value for money at around #1000, and Sony's KVA2942 at the same price is
also recommended.
Whether you plan to compile your own system from separates, or
purchase manufacturer's package, there is one golden rule: look AND
LISTEN before you leap.
Video Glossary
AV -- Shorthand used to denote the union of sound and vision --
audio/video.
Aspect Ratio -- The ratio between the height and width of a television
picture. A conventional television screen measures 4 units wide by 3
units high (4:3). Widescreen televisions now becoming available have an
aspect ratio of 16:9, although many films are made in a much wider,
21:9, ratio.
CD-I -- Compact Disc-Interative. CD-based audio/video/games
entertainment system, developed by Philips.
DSP -- Digital Soundfield Processing. Found on home cinema amplifiers
of Pro-Logic televisions, this is a method of artificially recreating
the acoustic characteristics of live venues, such as a church hall or an
open-air stadium.
Dolby Pro-Logic -- The domestic version of Dolby's cinema sound
system, Dolby Stereo. It includes standard left and right stereo
channels, a centre channel for dialogue and effects, plus a mono rear
effects channel, usually duplicated and sent to two surround speakers.
Dolby Surround Sound -- On equipment it refers to the
nearly-obsolescent three-channel domestic surround system which
pre-dated Pro-Logic.

THE July issue of a famous angling magazine has what appears to be a
timely selection of articles for the game angler. ''July Trout
Problems'' are addressed by Eric Taverner, Douglas Malone gives advice
on fishing for Ayrshire sea trout, there are essays on catching trout in
Yorkshire and salmon in Wales, the usual angling reports, and a piece by
Tom Stewart about Loch Leven and its presents problems, including the
possibility that something new and abhorrent may be introduced to the
Loch -- namely outboard motors.
If anything goes to show that no matter how much we advance in
technology, and that fishing still furnishes us with the same enduring
challenges, it is these excerpts from the partial reprinting of the
first issue of Trout and Salmon in this month's celebratory 40th
anniversary issue.
A message of congratulation from HRH Prince of Wales on the magazine's
place in his angling life very much echoes many people's feelings. Over
the years Trout and Salmon has been amusing, varied and informative,
sometimes controversial, and never afraid to address issues of
importance to those who participate in, or depend on, game fishing.
There is an article on the genesis of the magazine by one of those
involved, Bernard Venables, and I was surprised to find that the first
editor was that confirmed Loch Lomond angler Ian Wood. Early
contributors were all experienced anglers in their particular spheres .
. . Dermot Wilson on the chalk streams, Terry Thomas, often
controversial about tackle and tactics, and Bill Currie, giving his
individual Scottish slant.
As thoughts and techniques have advanced during the years the magazine
has, through looking for quality contributors, kept anglers up to date.
In the midst of all this innovation, however, the magazine has a soft
spot for those of nostalgic bent. There are frequent pieces that warm
the heart.
This month, for instance, George Darwell enthuses on the life and
times of a two-piece greenheart trout fly rod inherited from a
formidable school teacher (with a heart of gold, of course). It's this
variety that makes me look forward to the beginning of the month.
Because at my advanced age, my osmotic rate for technical innovation is
slow.
Mention Boobies or Collie Dogs to me and it takes a moment for me to
assimilate that we're talking flies here.
The writer of the first editorial, Howard Marshall, also ventured that
the reader would not be confined to game fishing in the British Isles.
He promised visits to New Zealand, Canada, and North America,
Scandinavia and Europe. I've lost count of the overseas articles I've
read in the magazine but the present editor Sandy Leventon still fulfils
Howard Marshall's promise with, this month, two articles -- one on flies
for Scandinavian salmon and sea trout, and the other on sea trout
fishing in the salt waters of Denmark.
The reproduced first edition of Trout and Salmon brings back many
memories. There is an advert for Cafaro Bros' famous Murray Bluebottle
Spiders. These were so successful because of the body material with
which they were tied that the range was extended from trout flies to
salmon, sea trout and terror flies.
But the item that took my eye most of all was a short piece about an
angler fishing the Loch of Skaill in Orkney. He'd landed a four pound
fish -- Skaill was famous for its big trout -- and had hooked another
good one, around three pounds. As he was playing it, two baby otters the
size of cats took hold of the fish and the angler was faced with a
tug-of-war until the cast broke and the otters escaped with their meal.
A good story and one I'd heard first-hand from the angler in question,
my dear friend and consummate rascal Ted Zawadzki.
As with many of Ted's stories, you were never entirely sure if every
word was true . . . perhaps there might occasionally be a hint of tongue
firmly in cheek as he led you along in that wonderful fractured
Scottish-Polish accent of his.
But the story was there in that first edition, so it must be true.
Sorry Ted, and thank you Trout and Salmon for that and so many other
memories.

THERE are a few rugby players of interest, some of them Scottish,
still happily enjoying life in South Africa a month after the World Cup.
Laurent Cabannes and Robert Jones are in Cape Town, Thierry Lacroix
and Olivier Roumat are enjoying Natal in Durban on the country's east
coast, and they are joined there by Derek Stark and Rob Wainwright.
Stark is there on holiday, and having a thoroughly good time
hob-nobbing it with Andre Joubert, but arguably Scotland's most
important player of the future, Rob Wainwright, is battling against an
Achilles tendon injury and is trying to get into the full Natal side for
a few games after two storming performances for Natal B.
''The big difference over here, apart from the obvious one that
includes being in a rugby-mad country, is that club rugby is really
secondary,'' he said. ''Some of the club games here are not very good at
all -- second-division compared to our stuff.
''I played for Natal B and that was still less than our district
rugby, but sitting on the bench for the Natal game, you quickly realise
that the top-level provincial rugby is just a step under international
status.''
Wainwright spent time with John Allan, the former Scottish hooker, at
a game reserve in the country, and that he found enjoyable. But the days
in South Africa's winter are short and he misses home. ''I have been
doing some coaching here, but it's been a real struggle to get over the
Achilles, and we haven't been doing much socialising at all.''
When Wainwright comes back to play in this country, and he would not
confirm any rumours as to where he will play next season after his spell
of unpaid leave from the Army, he will find himself in the midst of a
changing rugby game that has been beset by the taxing question of
professionalism.
''When you are out here, you realise just how quickly the pace of
change is going. With all of this talk about the Murdoch TV deal and the
Packer circus, everyone considers that the game will go full-time
professional.''
John Allan confirms that the speed of change could be much quicker
than people imagine. ''The boys here talk as though it could be next
week,'' said Allan.
''A lot of the boys have said that if the sort of money on offer was
really there, then they would go. It is one of those decisions in life
that has to be taken. Whatever happens, the game is going
professional.''
When Wainwright does eventually come back to these shores to play
rugby, there is no doubt that anyone wishing to influence the way the
national team thinks will first have to influence Wainwright. He is a
big, quiet man. A deep thinker. When it does get down to talking turkey
with whoever wishes to employ the players, it is likely that the army
captain will be there in the front rank, along with his friend and
playing colleague, Gavin Hastings.
The last time I spoke with Rob at any length before this interview was
after the World Cup final when Hastings, Rob the army captain, and I had
a couple of hours chewing the fat high above the stadium. They have some
thoughts close to their hearts about what needs to be done to get our
game on a par with the leading nations.
Wainwright is having a chance to see what is happening in the world's
most rugby-mad country at first hand, licking his wounds in big-game
country, but more importantly trying to put his inquisitive mind into
gear and cure the tendon in his heel.
He wanted, more than anything, strangely, for us to remind the world
that the Ivory Coast winger Max Britto was paralysed in the World Cup
and that the ongoing effort to secure a former player's future was
perhaps more important than anything else right now.
The one line I always remember about Rob Wainwright is that when he
first came on the scene there were suggestions that the boy was soft.
The boy was, folk had forgotten, a boxing blue from University. He could
be the next Lions' captain. He will definitely be the next Scotland
captain. He's quite a player.

'The great thing about athletics is that you are viewed as a
competitor in your own right, not somebody to be patronised'
WHEN the World Championships open next weekend in Gothenburg, the eyes
of the world will be on Linford Christie and other so-called athletics
heroes, as they pursue the records and victories which will enrich them
even more.
With his catalogue of 23 major championship medals, his achievements
compel respect. Yet Christie's millionaire status, his unseemly
wrangling over inflated appearance fees, and his petulant pleading to be
permitted a reprieve once eliminated from the AAA Championships,
surfaced almost as an obscenity this week when compared with the
achievements of Scottish track record-breaker Jamie Cuthbertson.
In my book, the 34-year old Cuthbertson is the greater sporting hero.
Last weekend he broke his own national records at 800 and 1500 metres,
in the European Championships. And for this he seeks no financial
reward.
His ambition is to trim just one more second from his two-lap time,
for that should book his place in the UK team for the Atlanta Olympics
next year -- by which time Christie insists he will have retired.
But Cuthbertson's vision of racing there is clear, and reinforced by
having run the three fastest times of his life last weekend in Valencia.
His body is lean and mean, hardened by training six days a week,
running up Ben Lomond, and by windsurfing, cycling, and ski-ing.
Yet Cuthbertson would not be an Olympic contender were it not for an
accident near Aldershot nine years ago.
A captain in the Royal Engineers, he was putting a group of recruits
through explosives training when a spark from a safety fuse ignited a
box of detonators. The blast damaged his right hand, and tore a
fist-sized lump from his right thigh. He lost six pints of blood,
surviving only thanks to immediate medical attention.
But they were unable to do anything about Cuthbertson's sight. He is
completely blind.
He has lost count of the number of operations he had to undergo:
''About a dozen, I guess, perhaps 15.'' Plastic surgery, and grafts,
plugged the hole in his right leg, gave him a new eyelid, and repaired
the tiny holes where metal fragments had pierced his face. The fingers
of his hand were saved. He labels it ''just a Guy Fawkes night type of
accident.''
Cuthbertson graduated from Glasgow University with a BSc in mechanical
engineering, then signed up for a three-year short service commission.
After the explosion he underwent prolonged treatment at St Dunstan's,
the service rehabilitation unit at Brighton. ''Psychologically, going
there did me a lot of good. It changes your perception of your problems
when confronted by blind colleagues who have no hands.'' Fourteen months
after the accident Jamie left the service, returning to Glasgow
University and graduating with a Masters degree in information
technology.
He is now full-time technology officer at the West of Scotland Society
for the Blind, as well as membership secretary and vice president of Red
Star, the Glasgow athletic club which caters for physically impaired
sportsmen and women, and those with learning difficulties.
''I was no great sportsman before,'' he confesses. ''I played rugby at
Kelvinside Academy, but only for the fourth XV. I did some
cross-country, hockey, and a bit of fencing.''
It was only three years ago that the 34-year old Cuthbertson took up
running again. He has already lowered the Scottish best for both 800 and
1500 metres, to 2-16.4 and 4-46.4 respectively this year, despite his
training having been curtailed by illness.
Both records were achieved last weekend at the European Championships
for the Blind in Valencia.
''If I can get below 2-15, I have a fair chance of going to Atlanta,
where our Olympics are staged immediately after the Games for
able-bodied competitors,'' he says.
Blind runners have guides, who run alongside, linked by a short
stretch of knotted rope. Social worker Pete Wyman, a top quality club
athlete who was part of Scotland's coaching team at last year's
Commonwealth Games, was Jamie's guide in Spain.
When he has no guide, Jamie works out on a treadmill in the dining
room of his Bearsden home: ''It can simulate hills or track repetitions,
and is safer than bumping into lamposts. But I love getting out on to
good paths on moorland, at Mugdock.
''It gives me some space, away from the family, and them space from
me.'' Jamie has married since that fateful day in 1986, and has three
young children. ''I'm lucky, I knew my wife, Shauna, before. So I know
what she looks like.
''The biggest loss is never seeing your children, not being able to
drive, and needing someone to deal with all your mail. ''But there is no
point in being a whinging git. You just bore people.
''The great thing about athletics is that you are viewed as a
competitor in your own right, not somebody to be patronised. At the club
we train with abled athletes, and are accepted. It is not a token
gesture.''
He insists that being blind has its compensations: ''I'm a better
skier now. Hills used to terrify me when I could see them. Now I go down
with a guide behind me, who shouts when to turn. It's just a matter of
blind faith.''

BRIAN Grant's injury jinx has struck again to rule him out of
Aberdeen's start to the new season, writes Ian Broadley.
The midfield player fractured the same arm which had earlier
threatened his career to deal a major blow to manager Roy Aitken's
plans. The break happened in a friendly match against Lossiemouth and
Aitken admitted: ''I cannot put a date on his comeback.
''The break came just below where his arm has been plated. They are
treating it as a normal fracture but there is no doubt it is a blow. We
don't need any player injured at this stage.''
With defender Brian Irvine also ruled out with MS, it means the
Pittodrie squad will be stretched.
Aitken plans to give youth its fling to fill the void. ''I intend to
promote from within and there will be opportunities for our
youngsters.''

RANGERS pushed their summer spending to within touching distance of an
astonishing #10m yesterday, when they completed the transfer of striker
Oleg Salenko from Valencia at Ibrox.
Salenko cost the Scottish champions #2.5m and is added to the #4.3m
they paid for Paul Gascoigne and the #3m paid out for Stephen Wright and
Gordan Petric.
It is the biggest cash outlay in the history of the Glasgow club and,
while there were delays in registering the two latest signings, Rangers
have completed the deals with the players' respective clubs.
The signing of the Russian, Salenko, has still to be passed by the
Department of Employment.
Although Petric had a work permit while he was with Dundee United, he
had to re-apply because he had changed clubs.
Last night he was given the all-clear which could allow him to play
today and will certainly have him available for the preliminary round of
the European Cup.
Salenko, of course, is a newcomer and, like all non-EEC nationals,
requires the work permit.
This, however, appears to be a minor problem. He is an established
international player and was in the Russian World Cup squad in the
United States last summer.
Both men strengthen the Rangers squad immensely and manager Walter
Smith pointed out: ''We cannot be confined by the European competition
rules, which limit us to three foreign players. There is no way that we
can lose sight of the domestic challenges we face.
''After all, we have to win at home before we can be in the Champions'
Cup. There is no way we can forget that. That is why we are going for
the best players available.
''In Europe, we will have a problem fitting them all in, but, at home,
that problem does not exist.''
Salenko clearly is a player who excites the Rangers manager. ''He
played against us when he was with Dynamo Kiev and gave us a lot of
problems,'' Smith recalled. ''He is just 26 and both Archie Knox and
myself saw him play for Russia in the World Cup last summer.
''He leads the line well and likes to do his work in the penalty box.
In build, and in style, he reminds you of Jimmy Millar.''
Smith admitted that Florin Raducioiu had been his main target but,
when that deal was in doubt, he looked elsewhere.
Salenko had been just one season with Valencia and Smith did not think
he would be available. When he found out he could be bought, he made his
move.
The striker eventually signed at lunchtime yesterday and added the
final touches to Smith's summer revolution.
Said Smith: ''I have been wanting to change the team around and have
also been looking to lowering the side's average age. I think I've been
able to do both.
''Now, I believe that we're better prepared than we have been for some
time. There is a better look about the squad and a better feel among the
players.
''I wanted to bring in another striker because both Ally McCoist and
Mark Hateley have suffered injuries over the past two seasons and I felt
we needed cover for them.''
Salenko cannot play in this weekend's Ibrox international tournament,
but McCoist has been included in the squad.
Smith also confirmed that Gascoigne and Wright will make their home
debuts against Steaua Bucharest in this afternoon's opening game.
''This is an important weekend for us, because this tournament can
help add that last competitive edge to the side. We have been much
happier with the way things have gone this close season.
''The fitness problems we had last season are not with us this time
and we have strengthened the squad significantly.
''We are a lot happier with the way we are looking.''

ISTANBUL: About 15,000 people fled the northwestern Turkish town of
Pamukova yesterday when a nearby army ammunition dump caught fire and
exploded, police said. Explosions rocked the hills around the town for
more than five hours but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Police in the provincial capital Sakarya said the cause of the blaze was
unknown.

JON Edwards could break two barriers at once today.
Britain's world triple jump record-holder is in Sestriere, Italy,
where a #100,000 Ferarri would be his reward for a world best, though he
acknowledges that coming from Tyneside -- car theft capital of the
Western world -- it would not last five minutes outside his door.
''I'd sell it,'' confesses Edwards who holds the existing world mark
at 17.98 metres, and hopes to be the first man, legally, beyond 18m. He
has already done so four times, but all wind-assisted.
However John Crotty, the UK national triple jump coach of the past 14
years, said: ''It's like Bob Beaman. Everybody used to say if he ever
took off close to the board, he would do well, and he certainly did. (He
set a world long jump record which lasted 23 years).
''It's just the same with Jon. There really is no reason why he should
not jump 19 metres.''
Sestriere, which lies at altitude, some 60 miles from Turin, is,
however, notoriously windy, and despite the erection of special screens,
Edwards may be denied again.
* SCOTLAND is taking early steps to prepare for what will almost
certainly be their final full senior international.
Turkey and Wales have indicated the Scots should fulfil the commitment
given to host next year's contest. They were due to stage the match
which was transferred to Wales last weekend because of a domestic
shortfall in funds.
Israel, who withdrew on the eve of the Cardiff meeting, are being
asked if they wish to travel, and the Scottish Athletic Federation is
seeking a major backer to ensure their final fling is memorable.
SAF secretary Bob Greenoak hopes that leading Scots, reluctant to
appear in recent years, will rally to the cause.
But Phil Mowbray cast doubts on the efforts of selectors who protested
they could not raise an adequate quality team for Wales.
Mowbray, the Scottish 1500m champion, who runs for Britain at 5000m
today in France, says he was not contacted for either event.
* LIZ McColgan, en route to Sweden and an attempt to regain her world
10,000m title, will keep her marathon love affair alive on Monday, being
airlifted to Greenwich by helicopter to unveil a new sponsor for the
London Marathon.
McColgan must compete in the event next year to fulfil the most
lucrative contract in the history of British athletics.
* THE Olympic sprint hurdles champion, Mark McKoy, has joined rival
Colin Jackson in withdrawing from the World Championships in Gothenburg.
He aggravated hip and tendon injuries during training yesterday.
* THE Sri Chinmoy 100km road race tomorrow at Riccarton (7am), is both
the UK and Scottish championship, and has attracted entries from all
over Europe, including 59-year-old Henri Gerault, who has completed more
than 300 such races.
Orcadian Angora rabbit fur farmer Willie Sichel defends his Scottish
title.

Riding The Rap by Elmore Leonard
Viking, #15.00
RAYLAN Givens is the kind of lawman who is peculiar to America. Or, to
be more specific, peculiar to American fiction. He is honest and
upright. Tough but scrupulously fair. He is Clint Eastwood and James
Stewart rolled in to one paragon of virtue. The solid, dependable,
personification of probity.
This searing book, the 32nd from the godfather of the modern American
crime novel, is to all intents and purposes an old-fashioned cowboy
story. (What Leonard work is not?) Givens is a US marshal, complete with
stetson and rattlesnake boots. He rides high in the saddle of a sleek
Jaguar automobile. For Carson City read the urban badlands north of
Miami; for desperadoes read low-life scumbags.
Riding the rap means there's nothing personal in it for Givens. You
commit the crime, you do the time. End of story. Start of sentence. Just
doin' my job, ma'am. He is a man who's gotta do those things that a
man's gotta do. And what he's gotta do, as a member of the Fugitive
Apprehension Strike Team, is round up Palm Beach County's pesky varments
and bring 'em to justice, dead or alive. They gotta ride the rap.
The character will be familiar to Leonard fans. In his last (and
frankly less satisfying novel), Pronto, Givens met up with the
incongruous Harry Arno, ageing bookie and founder member of the Florida
branch of the Ezra Pound fan club. With the law breathing down his neck
and the Mob after his blood, Arno high-tailed it to Italy -- with the
Marshal riding shotgun by his side.
Pronto ended back in Miami with Givens shooting a wiseguy to death in
a restaurant. Now, with the US Attorney after his badge, Riding The Rap
opens with Givens out to pasture, kicking his heels in the Strike Team
and waiting for things to cool down. Enter Harry Arno. Again.
This time Harry, who must surely be in line for the lucky white
heather, finds himself kidnapped by a trio of bad guys. There's Roberto
Deagracias or Bobby Deo, aka Bobby the Gardener, a Latino sociopath who
carries a pair of secateurs around with him to prune, not just plants,
but also fingers. Then there's Louis Lewis, a man with a rap sheet which
any self-respecting wannabee villain would kill for; a black Bajan who
tries to hide his West Indian origins behind an Afro-American accent and
a homeboy attitude. And there's Warren ''Chip'' Ganz III, who put his
momma in a home, spent all her money, and now he's deep in debt to the
bookies.
But Chip has a plan. Watching all that television crap about the
Iranian hostages gave him an idea. What if you steal a rich man,
blindfold him and let him simmer in a room for a while? Then you ask him
what he thinks his life's worth. And you make him pay you millions --
because life's not cheap. And the beauty of it is that there's no danger
of being caught because no-one knows the guy's been kidnapped; you make
it look as if he's just gone away for a while. No messy ransom demands
to his family. Just a straight financial transaction between Chip and
the hostage. If he won't deal then there's always Bobby's secateurs.
But Harry Arno is a bad choice for a kidnap victim because he's got a
friend called Raylan Givens. And for now Raylan Givens has nothing
better to do than look for Harry Arno.
The author is not just a master storyteller, he is also a social
anthropologist of the American underworld. Whether it's Detroit or
Florida, his two principal killing grounds, he tells it like it is.
Riding The Rap is typical, if a little short of vintage, Elmore Leonard.
But even an average Leonard is better than most of the rest. Life
doesn't come much lower than through his eyes.

TIM Henman dumped fellow Briton Mark Petchey out of the Northern
Electric Men's Open in Newcastle yesterday to book his place in the last
four.
The 20-year-old, world ranked 47 places below Petchey, moved into the
semi-finals with a superb display of attacking tennis.
Henman, who played a singles match in Britain's Davis Cup win over
Monaco earlier this month at the expense of Petchey, broke the
big-serving second seed's serve four times to win 7-5, 6-2 in a
rain-interrupted clash.
''The way I performed against a higher ranked opponent was very
pleasing,'' said the No.7 seed.
Henman now plays another big server, Belgian Dick Norman, who came
from a set down to beat fifth seeded Italian Omar Camporese 4-6, 7-6,
6-2 in the semi-finals.
* GREG Rusedski was spared further barracking as he and partner Paul
Wekesa, of Kenya, lost their second-round doubles match at the Canadian
Open in Montreal.
Adopted Briton Rusedski, a Montreal native, had been jeered by the
crowd when he lost in the first round of the singles competition earlier
this week after his decision to switch nationalities.
Meanwhile, top seed Andre Agassi and second ranked Pete Sampras made
comfortable progress through to the quarter-finals of the #1.2m
tournament.
Defending champion Agassi cruised past Daniel Vacek, of the Czech
Republic, 6-4, 6-2 while Sampras overcame a poor first serve percentage
of 40 to bypass Colombia's Mauricio Hadad 6-2, 6-3.
Former world No.1 Mats Wilander, currently ranked No.102, posted a
stunning 6-3, 6-2 upset over sixth-seeded Wayne Ferreira, of South
Africa, to log his first victory over a top-10 player this year.

THE harsh commercial realities of the sheep trade yesterday seemed a
million miles away from the pedigree world, or more precisely 68,000
guineas apart.
That was the new UK record price for a sheep set at Ingliston, near
Edinburgh, when a seven-month-old pedigree Suffolk ram bred in
Aberdeenshire put the Blackface breed and its #49,000 record firmly in
its place, never mind the previous best of 26,000gns for a Suffolk.
Selling the record breaker, which was the reserve champion and a son
of the 22,000gns Pankymoor Prelude, were the brothers Kenny and Bruce
Mair from Kinnermit, Turriff. The buyer was Jimmy Douglas, Woodhead of
Cairness, Fraserburgh.
Speaking after the sale, Bruce Mair said: ''We've been breeding
Suffolks for 40 years and this is one of the best, but he made about
three times more than we expected.'' Mr Douglas commented: ''When you
see a sheep like that you cannae afford to miss him. I was going to have
him at any price.''
The Mairs had a truly astonishing day, selling four others at above
10,000gns. The first went for 16,000gns jointly to Michael Walton,
Roseden, Alnwick, and J Greensit, Holme-on-Swale, Thirsk.
The next sold for 14,000gns to Stan Hulme, Crosemere Hall, Ellesmere,
Shropshire, followed by one at 13,000gns to Don Frame, Haspielaw,
Hamilton, buying with Robert Fleming, Boreland, Lesmahagow.
The Mairs rounded the day off by selling their overall champion at
12,000gns to Jonathan Hayward, East Learmonth, Cornhill on Tweed, to
gross #152,775 for 12 sold.
Mr Douglas did not have long to wait before recovering his investment
when he sold his best -- another son of Prelude -- for 32,000gns to
Jimmy Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, and John Sherrat,
Pankymoor, Wem, Shropshire. Mr Douglas also sold at 25,000gns to Tom
Bailey, Batterstown, County Meath, and again at 14,000gns to Stan Hulme.
A much-fancied second prize lamb from Welsh breeder Paul Delves of
Churchstoke, Powys, sold for 21,000gns to Ian Barbour, Beechgrove,
Annan, while Stan Hulme was back in the action selling his best at
14,000gns to the brothers Mair.
Sandy Campbell, Kirkton, Kinellar, Aberdeenshire, had a useful pen and
his number one duly fetched 15,000gns in a joint deal to Jock McCallum,
Mountrich, Dingwall, and K Gill and Co, Easter Templand, Fortrose,
Ross-shire.
However, this was bettered by one from the same pen at 32,000gns. This
one returns to the North-east to be shared by Harry Emslie, Brae of
Coynach, Mintlaw, Jimmy Douglas, and the Mairs.
Much of the action was concentrated at the beginning of the sale and
it was late in the afternoon when the final five-figure bid came at
10,000gns, with Sandy Lee, Fordafourie, Fraserburgh, selling to Gordon
Wilson, Bogs of Paithnick, Keith, and C McNeill, Tarneil, The Hollies,
Dingwall.
The breed president Sandy Campbell summed the day up when he said:
''It's absolutely marvellous for a handful of breeders, but I do think
when you look at the top prices for beef animals it's a wee bit out of
proportion.''

THE dissident shareholders' group which had brought forward
resolutions critical of the board of Scottish Pride was roundly defeated
at yesterday's annual general meeting.
An attempt by the group to force the board to seek the shareholders'
consent to any future closure or running down of any of the creamery
businesses was defeated by 7.7 million votes to 2.3 million. A
resolution calling on the company to meet the group's legal bills --
estimated at between #15,000 and #20,000 -- was rejected by 7.9 million
votes to 2.2 million.
Lord Sanderson of Bowden, company chairman, said he was prepared to
consider discussion and consultation on any changes but on a point of
principle the board could not accept the restrictions implied by the
motion on future closures.
The company's policy, he said, was to promote the island cheeses
strongly and to ensure better production from these centres. As an
ex-Highlands Minister, he would be the last person to want to close
island creameries -- ''because they are so important to the area.''
The restrictions proposed by those who had requisitioned the motions
for the agm were, however, ''something unheard of in normal company
practice,'' he said. ''Such an imposition should not be put on a board
of directors.''
Strong support for the board came from Sir David Landale,
Dumfriesshire, who said that the first he had heard of the existence of
a shareholders association was when he received notice from Scottish
Pride of the resolutions to be put before the agm. ''When they say they
represent the voice of milk producing shareholders I think that is not
correct -- they certainly do not represent me,'' he said to loud
applause.
''No board of directors could accept the restrictions proposed in
these resolutions,'' he added. ''They completely undermine the board's
ability to manage the business. I do not know how many hidden agendas
there are lurking behind these proposals but I do know these resolutions
are not helping your company.''
In moving that the company should reject the call to pay the costs
incurred by the shareholders association, Lord Sanderson pointed out
that the requisition containing their motions for discussions for the
agm had arrived without any prior notice or discussion.
The company had already incurred considerable expense in dealing with
the motions and it would inappropriate for company funds to be used to
reimburse the shareholders association.
The association withdrew one motion which called upon directors who
had purchased shares in February anbd March of this year to sell them
back to the company at the price then prevailing. Another resolution,
which would have made it possible for share deals to be agreed between
two individuals without going through the company stockbroker, was
defeated.
Speaking after the meeting, Michael McCreath, Garlieston Home Farm,
Newton Stewart, secretary of the shareholders association, said he was
confident that donations would be received to meet the legal and
professional bills incurred in drawing up the motions for the meeting.
In the future he envisaged the association adopting a much broader
role. It could play an important part in providing a platform where
individual producers could air their views.
Lord Sanderson said future relations with the group was something that
would evolve. He regretted the damage that had been done by creating
uncertainty in the minds of customers.

DUNCAN Farquhar and Kevin Rickerby overcame a final day of light winds
on the Clyde to win the crucial last race of Loch Long Week and collect
the Clyde Cup for the Loch Long class title for the third time in six
years.
Sailing Sula, the Cove pair made the most of what feeble whispers of
breeze there were and maintained their lead to the finish after sailing
just one circuit, despite the thick mist which made finding the turning
marks difficult.
Overnight leader Murray Caldwell in Rebel, who was bidding to become
the youngest skipper to win the title, finished ninth yesterday and had
to be content with second overall. Results:
Race 6 -- 1, Sula (D Farquhar); 2, Zephyr (C Still); 3, Allegro (A
Black/M Bradshaw); 4, Oronsay (M McDonald); 5, Moonshine (G McGarrity).
Overall -- 1, Sula 12.5 points; 2, Rebel (M Caldwell) 17.75; 3,
Boomerang (G Hutchinson) 19.75; 4, Allegro 20.75; 5, Zephyr 27.
* THE Tennent's West Highland Yachting Week takes to the seas off
Crinan, Oban, and Tobermory in turn, starting with a passage race from
Crinan to Oban tomorrow.
A total of 165 boats have entered this year with a significant growth
in the East Coast complement represented by competing yachts from as far
afield as Hartlepool and the Forth.
While the keen racing edge to Class 1 may have been dulled as more of
the country's top racing boats abandon the week in favour of the bigger
fleets of Bangor and Cork Weeks, there is still no shortage of variety
from the 46-foot Swan of Martin Dooney which is Irish registered and
sailing under the flag of the New York Yacht Club down to the new Melges
24s.
* TOP English yachtsman Lawrie Smith yesterday revealed why he took
the decision to race with America in this year's Champagne Mumm
Admiral's Cup, as Great Britain struggled once more on the second day of
racing.
''I would have loved the chance to race with the British team,''
explained Smith. ''But two months ago when I was asked by the Americans
I didn't even know if there was going to be a British entry.
Acting as tactician on the American yacht Blue Yankee, owned by
Connecticut millionaire Bob Towse, Smith's local knowledge in the Solent
off Cowes proved vital as 24 yachts from eight nations headed off for
the 200-mile Channel Race yesterday. Details:

DESPITE a fierce onslaught of hostile bowling from their four-pronged
pace attack, the West Indies were unable to seize the initiative from
England in this Fourth Test match at Old Trafford yesterday.
On 347 for seven, when bad light and rain ended play early, and with
five overs remaining, England were comfortably placed with a lead of
131, and with three wickets standing.
Graham Thorpe, with an innings of great merit, had taken England to
this position of strength. He had paced his innings entirely according
to England's need -- helping MichaelAtherton first in building a solid
foundation and then consolidating it in partnership with Robin Smith.
He waited for the right balls to hit, and picked up runs more rapidly
when the opportunity came during a four-and-a-half hour stay at the
crease. He finally departed just six short of a century after having
faced 147 balls.
At the end of the day's play, Thorpe said: ''I am a little
disappointed at getting out on 94, but I think we are in a good
position.'' He added: ''It's harder to get runs against the West Indies
in this country. They seem to get the ball through a lot quicker.''
The momentum gained by England on the first day was fully maintained
throughout another action-packed session which saw the Tourists'
frustrations boil over. Unable to make early inroads into the England
innings, the West Indians resorted to a series of fast, short-pitched
deliveries which England's batsmen faced without flinching.
Having resumed the innings on 65 for two, England's captain Mike
Atherton, who, on 26, was dropped by Brian Lara at first slip off Ian
Bishop's third over, staged another gritty performance taking his score
to 47, from the overnight 15, during a stamina-sapping three hours at
the crease.
During that period, he was hit on the chest by a bouncer from Courtney
Walsh, who then unleashed two more deliveries which umpire Dickie Bird
considered intimidatory according to Law 42.8 and consequently issued a
warning to the bowler.
England's batsmen coped admirably with the aggressive bowling, and the
slowing down tactics of the West Indians.
Curtly Ambrose, who had claimed his 250th Test wicket when he
dismissed Atherton, caught behind off his gloves -- a decision which the
England captain did not feel happy about -- later in the day stopped
several times in his run-up.
Normally, this has a distracting effect on a batsman, apart from
slowing the game down, and the West Indies captain, Richie Richardson,
had to go over twice to speak to his bowler.
Shortly after that, the big Antiguan dismissed Smith with a
spectacular diving catch at second slip by substitute fielder Williams.
He had been on the field all day for Carl Hooper, who has a broken
finger.
Smith, who has been in fine form in this series from the second Test
Match, had once again batted with great determination. Along with
Thorpe, he put on 104 for the fourth wicket when he was dismissed just
before tea. It was the third big partnership the two had shared, having
put together 111 and 85 in the two innings at Lord's.
During their century stand, they faced a relentless attack of
belligerent bowling. Smith received a nasty hit on the elbow -- albeit
on that occasion the bowler was not to blame as Smith had ducked into
the ball expecting it to be a lifter.
Thorpe and Smith made full use of the best batting strip in the series
so far. Smith hit Benjamin twice for 4 off his legs before lunch to see
the bowler replaced, and Thorpe was effortless in his strokeplay.
After having pulled Ambrose for 4, he cut Bishop to the boundary at
the start of the second session and then pushed him firmly for 3 to
mid-on to register his twelfth Test half-century.
Although beaten outside the off-stump by both Bishop and Walsh, Thorpe
remained unperturbed and progressed to 70 at tea, which was taken early
owing to a steady drizzle.
In the final session of the day, Thorpe unleashed a severe attack on
the West Indian bowling, with paceman Benjamin conceding 20 runs in one
over, the seventieth of the day. The left-handed batsman had taken 16 of
those runs with four consecutive boundaries -- the first and last of
which were drives to mid-off and the other two were pulls to mid-wicket
and square leg.
The 300 was up on the board in the eighty-eighth over and by this
time, West Indies' bowlers were losing a little of their rhythm. Of the
34 no balls, in the total of 51 extras, 20 were bowled yesterday.

FORMER Ryder Cup player Brian Barnes produced another typically
powerful display to open a three-stroke lead after the second round of
the Senior British Open yesterday at Royal Portrush.
The 50-year-old senior rookie again demonstrated his new-found buoyant
mood and superb form with a second successive five-under-par 67
featuring an eagle 3 and four birdies. His only blemish was a last-hole
bogey 5. His eagle at the par-5 tenth -- achieved with ''the best
No.3-wood shot of my life'' to eight feet -- gave him his first
significant move ahead of the field.
Barnes, who dearly wants to win the title over the course where his
father-in-law Max Faulkner won the Open 44 years ago, finished with a
10-under-par halfway total of 134.
He holds a three-shot lead over formidable American senior Bob Murphy,
who is second at seven under after a 69.
John Morgan, last year's PGA Seniors Tour Order of Merit winner, moved
into the reckoning with a four-under-par second round 68, just 24 hours
after almost pulling out with a back injury. He climbed into third at
five under par, five behind Barnes.
Leading aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
134 -- B Barnes 67, 67.
137 -- B Murphy (USA) 68, 69.
139 -- J Morgan 71, 68.
140 -- J Jacobs (USA) 69, 71.
141 -- M Gregson 72, 69; J Fourie (S Africa) 70, 71.
Other scores included: 143 -- B Charles (New Zealand) 70, 73. 145 -- B
Huggett 74, 71. 146 -- T Wargo (USA) 75, 71; G Player (S Africa) 77, 69;

VAGLIANO TROPHY
THE Scots kept Great Britain and Ireland in touch yesterday in the
Vagliano Trophy at Ganton, where they won three out of only four
victories the team tallied against their continental rivals.
However, their best efforts were not enough to prevent the team from
trailing the Europeans by 6[1/2]-5[1/2] after the first day, signalling
the possibility that the trophy may leave the British Isles for the
first time in six years.
Stirling's Alison Rose and her English partner Emma Duggleby put the
first full point on the board in the foursomes. Mhairi McKay, of
Turnberry, and Janice Moodie, of Windyhill, made up for a foursomes
defeat with wins in the singles. The only other win in the afternoon
came from Ireland's Hazel Kavanagh.
Moodie came back from two down to defeat Mourgue D'Algue, the
runner-up in this year's British Championship, thanks mainly to a huge
putt from off the edge of the green at the eleventh and a chip-in from
35 yards at the thirteenth. McKay was never behind in her 4 and 3 win
over Sara Beautell, of Spain. Details (GB&amp;I names first):
Foursomes -- J Hall and L Walton halved with M Hjorth and S Eriksson;
J Moodie and M McKay lost to S Beautell and A Belen Sanchez, 3 and 2; A
Rose and E Duggleby beat K Mourge D'Algue and A Vincent, 3 and 2; H
Kavanagh and E Rose-Power halved with S Cavalleri and M Pons.
Singles -- Hall lost to Eriksson, 3 and 1; Walton halved with Sanchez;
S Lambert lost to W Stensrud, 1 hole; Moodie beat Mourgue d'Algue, 3 and
2; Rose lost to Pons, 2 and 1; Kavanagh beat Cavalleri, 2 holes; Power
lost to Hjorth, 5 and 4; McKay beat Beautell, 4 and 3.
* CURTIS Cup competitors Mhairi McKay and Janice Moodie will not
compete for Scotland in the Home International matches at Wrexham from
October 4 to 6, the Scottish Ladies Golf Association confirmed
yesterday.
The Great Britain and Ireland internationalists are unable to compete
due to academic commitments and the eight-strong team will now be headed
by Stirling's Alison Rose and Scottish Ladies champion Hilary Monaghan
of Longniddry. Team:
C Agnew (Eastwood), J Ford (Gullane Ladies), F McKay (Turnberry), S
McMaster (Dunbar), H Monaghan (Longniddry), L Nicholson (Haddington), A
Rose (Stirling), L Roxburgh (Tain).
Reserves -- A Laing (Vale of Leven), F F McKay (Elgin), L Moffat (West
Kilbride), C Hunter (Deeside).

BRITAIN'S Laura Davies clipped a stroke off her own course record
yesterday with a 66 in the second round of the Guardian Irish Holidays
Open at St Margaret's in Dublin.
Despite a 7 at the eighth, Davies, the holder, posted a 13-under-par
halfway total of 133, eight strokes clear of England's Lora Fairclough
and Lisa Hackney, who share second place with American Jill McGill.
Scotland's Gillian Stewart and Dale Reid, following respective rounds
of 73 and 68, are in a group one stroke behind at four-under-par 142.
Davies missed a birdie at the first but made amends by holing from 25
feet for an eagle at the fourth, which she followed with birdies at the
sixth and seventh holes.
Disaster struck at the 451-yard eighth, where Davies drove into the
lake. After taking a penalty drop she went through the green with a
No.3-iron, then chipped back to eight feet, from where she took three
putts.
Not even this could stop Davies. She birdied the next three holes then
added two more at the long sixteenth and seventeenth to open up her
biggest ever halfway lead. Leading second-round scores (British and
Irish unless stated):
133 -- L Davies 67, 66.
141 -- L Hackney 70, 71; L Fairclough 68, 73; J McGill (USA) 67, 74.
142 -- D Reid 74, 68; S Strudwick 71, 71; M Koch (Germany) 70, 72; G
Stewart 69, 73.
Scottish scores: 145 -- M McKinlay 70, 75. 146 -- J Forbes 70, 76.
Non-qualifiers: 152 -- T Craik 75, 77. 158 -- J Kinloch 81, 77.

SAM Torrance, who came in with a magnificent 64 to finish 10 under par
on 132 and grab the halfway lead in the in the #650,000 Heineken Dutch
Open at Hilversum, afterwards credited his wife, Suzanne, for his
self-confidence.
Torrance, who always seems to reserve his best form for Ryder Cup year
and has already clinched his place, chalked up a glorious eagle 3 at the
fourth and followed that with birdies at the fifth and seventh to go out
in 32. Two bogeys on the back nine denied him a course record, although
he chalked up his second eagle of the day at the twelfth.
He had good reason to be well satisfied, and said: ''I have drawn a
lot of strength from Suzanne over the years through her philosophy on
life. She tells me 'worry is the interest on the inevitable'.''
Ian Woosnam, meanwhile, is adamant he will not keep playing just to
ensure his place in the Ryder Cup team. The Welshman lies just out of
the selection zone at eleventh place and knows he is not guaranteed a
wild card by captain Bernard Gallacher, despite past glories including
the 1991 US Masters title.
But at least he showed yesterday that he can still get his game
together when the pressure is on by posting a fine 66. He goes into
today's third round four behind Torrance.
Woosnam said: ''I am playing next week and the week after plus the US
PGA Championship. But I won't keep playing just to get in the Ryder Cup.
I have never had to be picked for the cup. If I miss it then it is up to
Bernard. It is his problem. Jose Maria Olazabal has never kept playing
to get in, nobody else has, so why should I?''
Open champion John Daly, who also shot a 66, is so desperate to play
for America he is willing to strike up a bargain with captain Lanny
Wadkins. ''If he picks me I will let him tell me what to hit off the
tees,'' Daly promised after thrilling the galleries with a string of
birdies including three in a row from the tenth.
While Daly was basking in the glory at St Andrews, Woosnam trailed in
a lowly forty-seventh. He has played only eight events before Holland
this year, missing the cut in three of them.
One under overnight, he picked up three birdies in the first nine
holes. He dropped a shot at the eleventh, but that was the only blemish
on his card and he picked up further shots at the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and the last.
Torrance leads by two shots from joint overnight leader Ireland's
Philip Walton, another player aiming to secure a Ryder Cup berth, and
Lancashire's Paul Eales, in his third season on the tour.
Eales, who came in with a 65, managed second spot in the Canaries Open
but his form has been patchy this year.
Colin Montgomerie was five adrift after a 70 while Open runner-up
Costantino Rocca made the cut on the button at 141 along with English
pro Steve Bottomley, who was joint third at St Andrews. On the same
score is Gleddoch's Dean Robertson, the third and last Scottish
survivor.
On the wrong side by just one shot are Paul Lawrie and Mike Miller,
the same mark as Scottish Open champion Wayne Riley. Leading scores
(British or Irish unless stated):
132 -- S Torrance 68, 64.
134 -- P Walton 65, 69; P Eales 69, 65.
135 -- S Hoch (USA) 65, 70; M Jonzon (Sweden) 70, 65; M James 70, 65.

TROUBLED Southampton keeper Bruce Grobbelaar has received a welcome
bonus of around #1000 from the Zimbabwe government.
The Zimbabwe internationalist, jointly charged with conspiracy related
to match-fixing, was among 19 players awarded individual bonuses of
12,000 Zimbabwe-dollars as a morale-booster ahead of tomorrow's crucial
African Nations Cup qualifier against Cameroon.
Sports minister Witness Mangwende said the bonus was not conditional
on the squad winning the match -- it was a token of appreciation from
the government for the players' training efforts.
Zimbabwe must win to secure a place in the Africa Cup finals in South
Africa in January.
On Monday Hampshire police charged Grobbelaar with four counts of
conspiracy relating to match-fixing of Premier League games. Four others
were also charged, including Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers and Aston
Villa striker John Fashanu.
* MANAGERLESS Hearts strolled to a 6-0 win against Peterhead last
night.
Temporary manager Eamonn Bannon fielded a strong side against the Blue
Toon, but had to wait until 20 minutes for the opener, when Murie
slipped his man and scored, with Colin Cram and Scott Leitch striking a
double blow in the five minutes before the break.
Peterhead's new #9000 signing from Cove Rangers, Doug Baxter, battled
hard in midfield, but John Colquhoun and Brian Hamilton took Hearts to
5-0. John Robertson, a second-half substitute, celebrated his re-signing
with a spot-kick two minutes from time.
* DUNDEE United will field #1.25m in summer signings today when they
tackle Brechin City at Glebe Park.
Ex-Coventry defender Steven Pressley and Sandy Robertson will make
their debuts alongside another former Ranger, keeper Ally Maxwell.
* MORTON manager Allan McGraw made one of his biggest signings last
night when he retained club captain Derek McInnes.
The midfield player has been the subject of interest from a host of
clubs north and south of the Border during last season, but the new
one-year contract keeps his options open.
''Morton have made me a very good offer and, having just been
promoted, I'm happy to get things settled,'' he said.
''I have an agreement with the club that if anyone shows interest
during the season, they will not stand in my way.''
* FA CUP winners Everton lost 3-1 to Mersey rivals Tranmere in a
friendly at Prenton Park last night. John Aldridge (11 minutes), new
signing Gary Bennett (66), and Pat Nevin (77) scored for Tranmere while
Duncan Ferguson (82) grabbed Everton's consolation.
* CALEY Thistle scored a shock 2-0 win over a Motherwell XI at Fir
Park last night. Dougie Green blasted home the opening goal in 11
minutes and on the hour mark Martin Lyall scored with a blinding volley.

From the pier to the pan - fast. That's good enough for Conrad Wilson
when it comes to seafood.
AS A place for restaurants, Oban has always seemed a bit of a
graveyard. The hotels along the waterfront offer orthodox menus, the
fail-safes of British cuisine, tired dishes and bar snacks served
without flair, while the sea outside teems with fish. Nowhere is
Britain's deep suspicion of fresh seafood more prevalent than in its
seaside towns, of which Oban is an example as depressing as any.
But things perhaps are changing. Oban may have destroyed its fine
period railway station and replaced it with a building as trivially
bijou as the trains that come in and out. It may have cluttered its
harbourside with an irrelevant brick shopping centre incongruously
disguised as a maltings. But, squeezed between station and shops, a
small touch of authenticity has been carelessly allowed to survive. What
was once a fishermen's mission, its metal-framed windows still intact,
its air of a 1930s garage or roadhouse still definable, is now the
Waterfront Restaurant.
Though it has been up and running for the past five years, people
scuttling between train and boat probably give it no more than a glance,
and consider this to be all it is worth. It does undoubtedly look
somewhat makeshift. Yet there is something about it that should halt
fish-lovers in their tracks. I spotted it, en passant, a year ago, and
vowed to give it a try. This year I did so. The Waterfront indeed serves
seafood, not only seafood but fresh seafood, your genuine catch of the
day. Crab, langoustine, monkfish, sole, and halibut co-exist with the
more predictably Obanese scampi and chips. In short, an effort is being
made to recognise and live up to the potential of what, in Dieppe or
Honfleur or Barcelona, would be a sought-after site.
The restaurant, one floor up, has done its best to create the right
sort of ambience, with the black and white decor of traditional French
and Belgian seafood joints, the similarly monochrome waiters, some
(again very French) touches of scarlet, and smart, polite service. The
open-plan kitchen, with three busy chefs in whites, looks like the real
thing. ''We've no guilty secrets,'' remarked a waitress when I exclaimed
about this. ''From the pier to the pan as fast as we can,'' is the
place's printed motto.
The day's menu, chalked on blackboards, bears this out. It may offer a
fresh crab and avocado starter, paupiettes of sole stuffed with prawns,
langoustines cooked in garlic and white wine, halibut in a tomato
hollandaise. If these do not entice, there is also the formal printed
menu, on which lobster comes two ways, at a by no means greedy #17 a
throw. The Oban fish chowder is saved from being blandly glutinous by a
generous quantity of salmon and scallops, complete with corals. Though
meat-eaters are not neglected -- steak pie is one of several
appeasements -- it would be foolish to think of the Waterfront except in
terms of fish.
Over in Tobermory, seafood seems largely limited to token offerings.
Moreover, the cooking confirms my general impression that -- with the
exception of Sicily -- you seldom eat well on islands. Sicily,
admittedly, is a big island with a big population and its own vivid
cuisine. But driving off the ferry at Craignure does prompt hopes that
are unlikely to be fulfilled. Tobermory's tiny village fish shop, with
the sparsest of window displays, implies that seafood is not a local
priority, and the waterfront cafes and restaurants rather bear this out.
The Western Isles Hotel, poised above the village, has found refuge
this year in the East, with an ingenious Asiatic menu featuring dishes
from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, China, and the Philippines. But only
the Back Brae Restaurant has attempted, with some success, to create a
meaningful Tobermory menu based on shellfish and venison. Even the
scampi and chips are worthy of their name, which is saying something in
Scotland.
Where it falls down, as many such places do, is in its saucing. What
could be brilliantly fresh scallops emerge sodden in garlic butter, and
Tobermory trout -- small and potentially tasty -- is done no favours by
its accompanying garlic mayonnaise. But the vegetarian starters are OK
and the place itself, a cosy whitewashed room at the top of a courtyard
staircase, has the right feel. The service is friendly, the atmosphere
convivial, and dinner markedly superior to lunch. When a concert
overruns at the Mendelssohn on Mull festival, late eaters are
accommodated rather than turned away. The short wine-list includes
well-priced whites from Chile and California, and an excellent house
claret.
Tobermory's Back Brae, like Oban's Waterfront, is an oasis. But the
fact remains that the best seafood in the area is what you can buy from
the little stall on the Oban harbourside, wide-ranging, unsauced, and
utterly fresh. Buy its crab and prawn sandwiches to take on board the
boat or train. You won't get anything like them from Caledonian
MacBrayne or British Rail.
* Waterfront Restaurant, 1 The Waterfront, The Pier, Oban (tel: 01631
563110). Average cost of a two-course meal for two with an inexpensive
bottle of wine: about #48.

FIERY Fred Funk plundered nine birdies from the defenceless Pleasant
Valley course to vault into a five-stroke lead after his second round at
the $1m Ideon New England Classic in Worcester, Massachusetts,
yesterday.
Funk, renowned for displaying bad temper when his game is not on song,
had no cause for complaint after shooting nine-under-par 63 in benign
morning conditions.
He posted a tournament record low 13-under 129 halfway total, while
fellow Americans Brian Claar (66), Gene Sauers (68), and Dan Forsman
(65) were tied for second on 134 with half the field back in the
clubhouse.
''You can hit it good all day, but if you're not putting good you're
not going to shoot 63,'' said Funk, who claimed he did not miss a putt
from inside 10 feet.
He made a technical adjustment following Thursday's first round, and
putted yesterday with more weight on his left side in an effort to keep
the putter closer to the ground.
Funk, 39, had his lone US Tour victory at the 1992 Houston Open.
Leading completed scores (Americans unless stated):
129 -- Fred Funk 66, 63.
134 -- Brian Claar 68, 66; Gene Sauers 66, 68; Dan Forsman 69, 65.

WHEN a friend returned from a cycling holiday in Belgium many years
ago with a pannier crammed with beer it was an introduction for
Cellarman to the wealth of brewing from that nation. And on a sunny
afternoon in his country garden he pulled bottle after bottle out of the
pannier. Bright, colourful labels adorned with cherries, peaches, monks
and nuns which may have rested better in a wine store but for names such
as lambic, kriek, faro, gueuze, mars, saisons, Trappist and abbey.
But on that hot summer's day it was the lambic that gradually made an
impression through bitter, almost cider-like, samples to those which had
peach, cherry, and raspberry flavours.
It is a beer of undoubted individuality and a pedigree splashed with
purple hue. A royal decree was conferred upon it almost 30 years ago and
all lambics must be brewed in accordance with certain rules to retain
their legitimacy.
Its life begins in the winter months in a not unfamiliar fashion. To
the mash tun is added 30% unmalted wheat and 70% roasted barley. Later,
seasoned hops that have passed their sell-by date are added. They
provide no flavour, aroma, or bitterness; their purpose is to protect
the beer against infection as they contain a natural antiseptic. Lambic
brewers have time on their hands and they often let the wort boil for
six hours compared with a more standard 90 minutes.
But it is after this that science departs and nature has its way. The
beer is poured into shallow troughs, often in the loft of the brewery,
where the windows are left open overnight to allow the invasion of
''wild yeast angels'' who dive into the brew and cause a fair turmoil.
It is otherwise know as spontaneous fermentation. The yeasts that take
this moonlight dip are common to an area near Brussels called
Payottenland in the Zene Valley and it is only beer brewed in this way
and from this area that can truly call itself a lambic.
From its room at the top, the beer is transferred into old oak barrels
where fermentation continues but it is not until two weeks have passed
that the bung can be put in and the barrel laid aside for six months.
Because of its dependence on wild yeasts for fermentation and the use
of different-sized oak barrels, no two lambics are identical other than
having a general cider-like taste with a lemony tang. In this straight
form, however, it is rarely available outside Brussels.
Lambics are used as the base for many fruit beers and by the marriage
of the young and old a beer named gueuze is created. In the making of
gueuze several blends may be used to create individual characteristics.
Timmermans at Itterbeck is a traditional lambic brewer which produces
two types of gueuze, a medium-sweet called Feltfa and the other a much
drier and perhaps preferable version called Caveau. The brewery also
produces a range of lambic-based fruit beers which are enjoying an
increase in popularity.
In the making of cherry beer (kriek) a quantity of cherries is added
to the barrel of lambic and after six to eight months soaking the fruit
is completely dissolved. When the beer has been strained a quantity of
young lambic is introduced to create a secondary fermentation which also
puts a bit of life into the bottle. Cherry beers may differ in taste
among brands as much depends on how long the beer and fruit have been in
company.
Raspberries, blackcurrants, and peaches have also been used
successfully in the brewing of lambic-based fruit beers. However,
despite this Belgian traditionof making so many beers, lager is popular
among 70% of the population. In Scotland the picture is not unfamiliar
with Tennent's lager being consumed in greater quantity than pints of
milk, and that's every day.

CHRIS Eubank will be fighting to please the bank manager tonight and
not purely to flex his muscles for the September 9 rematch with
Ireland's Steve Collins.
The former World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion meets
Spain's Jose Igancio Barruetabena over 10 rounds at Whitley Bay, but
insists that his night at the local ice rink is not principly designed
as a warm-up for his vital clash with Collins in Cork.
''I regard this as a pay day. I'm not fighting to get warmed-up, I'm
fighting for money,'' said Eubank.
Money, of course, has been Eubank's main motivating factor in a career
including 20 successive WBO champioship bouts -- and Barruetabena does
not threaten to make the ex-champion work overtime for his latest pay
packet.
The Spaniard, the son of a Bilbao fisherman, has netted a decent
record of 18 wins and one defeat, but his standard of opposition has not
been over-demanding and his sole loss came in his stiffest test to date,
against the unbeaten Russian, Andrei Pestriaev.
But to keep winning is the way to get rated and the WBO's
often-criticised rankings list recently placed Barruetabena at No.10 in
the 12st division.
Barruetabena, though, appears to be a bulked-up light-middle. Only a
year ago, he was scaling 11st 2lb and, with tonight's match made at 12st
3lb, Eubank will be an extremely strong fighting specimen.
The distance of the fight will depend on which version of Eubank
climbs through the ropes, as the ex-champion has the habit of rising or
falling to his opponent's level.
Barruetabena's chances look to be zero. It is just a matter of when
Eubank will move successfully on to his #1.6m fight with Collins.
Also on the bill is Irvine's WBO junior flyweight champion Paul Weir.
He meets the experienced Jose Luis Valarde over 10 rounds as he waits
for a money-spinning fight against former world champion Jake Matlala in
South Africa.

COLIN McRae has powered into the lead of the fifth round of the World
Rally Championship in New Zealand and is now on course for a hat trick
of victories.
The 26-year-old from Lanark, navigated by Derek Ringer, moved his
Subaru Impreza up from equal fifth on Thursday's first leg into a
12-second lead over defending world champion, Frenchman Didier Auriol,
whose Toyota team-mate, Germany's Armin Schwarz, has slipped from second
to third, 29 seconds behind McRae.
Finland's Juha Kankkunen, co-driven by Nicky Grist, from Abergavenny,
is fourth in his Toyota Celica.
Kenneth Eriksson, driving for Andrew Cowan's Mitsubishi Lancer Team,
ended yesterday's leg of nine stages in fifth place.
Snow is forecast for today's third leg which includes the 45km Motu
special stage, the longest and most demanding in the four day, 2000km
rally, which finishes in Auckland today. Results:
1, C McRae/D Ringer, Subaru Impreza, 2hr 05min 26sec; 2, D Auriol/D
Giraudet (F), Toyota Celica, 2-05:38; 3, A Schwarz/K Wicha (D), Toyota
Celica, 2-05:55; 4, J Kankkunen (Fin)/N Grist (GB), Toyota Celica
2-06:01; 5, K Eriksson/S Parmander (S), Mitsubishi Lancer 2-06:03; 6, F
Delecour/C Francois (F), Ford Escort, 2-06:16; 7, R Burns/R Reid, Subaru
Impreza 2-06:25.
ALISTER McRae completed yesterday's first leg of the two-day
Belfast-based Stena Sealink Ulster Rally in ninth place overall.
Like the majority of top seeded drivers, the 24-year-old from Lanark
fought to control his Nissan Sunny on slick tyres in the second of
Friday's six special stages when a cloudburst turned a dry road into a
torrent of rainwater.
Kelso's Dominic Buckley, driving a VW Golf, finished the day in
eleventh place overall.
Kilmarnock's Robbie Head, driving for the French-based Renault Clio
team, was thriteenth.
The 450-mile rally -- which finishes in Belfast this afternoon -- is
led by Ulsterman Bertie Fisher in a four-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza.
Leading results:
1, B Fisher/R Kennedy (Subaru Impreza) 1hr 01min 38sec; 2, S Finlay/P
Mills (Ford Escort) 1-02-20; 3, A Nesbitt/B Murphy (Toyota Celica)

GERMAN GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill has been threatened with a life ban from motor racing by
one of the sport's top officials.
Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors' Association,
yesterday blamed Hill for his shunt with arch-rival Michael Schumacher
at the British Grand Prix a fortnight ago.
''Hill blundered and I think the stewards at Silverstone were wrong
even to blame Schumacher. He was not guilty of anything,'' said
Ecclestone, who is also deputy chief at FIA, the sport's ruling
authority.
''Drivers should remember that we can take away their licence for a
life-time. We would not hesitate to do it for acts of stupidity.
''Somebody could get killed or hurt if this sort of thing carried on.
These are not dodgems they are driving, they are very fast racing
cars.''
Hill insisted this week that he was not guilty of any misdemeanour
after being branded ''crazy and stupid'' by Schumacher for attempting to
overtake the German at Silverstone.
The resulting collision took both drivers out of the race, but Hill
said he would not hold back if a similar opportunity arose.
Ecclestone has ruled out the possibility of Hill and Schumacher
sitting side by side during tomorrow's parade lap for the German Grand
Prix, as it is against the rules.
It already had been quite a day for Hill at Hockenheim.
His so-called peace-pact with world champion Schumacher was scuppered,
he spun off in practice, then blew kisses to a jeering crowd, and, at
the last minute, took provisional pole position just ahead of Renault
Williams team-mate David Coulthard, relegating Schumacher and his
Benetton to third place.
All this before another practice today which will decide the final
grid positions for tomorrow's race.
Bitter rivals Hill and Schumacher had agreed to sit together in a
vintage car during the parade lap before tomorrow's race in the hope of
quelling any threat of problems from the 120,000 sell-out crowd.
But Hill's Williams team revealed yesterday that the plan had been
overruled by the powerful Ecclestone.
''We made an official request as we felt we should do in the
situation, but we've been told no,'' said a Williams spokeswoman. ''It
is very disappointing. ''We have been told that if Damon and Michael
were allowed to do it, then everybody would want to.''
Hill, who allegedly received death threats last year, again has a
personal bodyguard to prevent the threat of a possible attack from a
fanatical fan.
Schumacher, though angry at the way Hill had ''taken him out'' at
Silverstone, had accepted the offer after having asked his supporters to
be fair to his British rival.
Out on the racetrack, meanwhile, Hill secured provision pole position
with a last-gasp flying lap. He clocked 1min 44.932sec with only two
minutes remaining as the track dried out on a day of intermittent wet
and dry spells. He finished three-tenths of a second ahead of Coulthard.
Hill drew some of the sting from the big crowd in the morning. After
having spun off in wet conditions in the stadium section of the
high-speed track, he climbed out of his car. When the crowd jeered and
shouted at him, he blew kisses and waved in reply. There were no
security scares for Hill or the Williams team, despite fears they would
be intimidated or threatened.
Hill was left grinning with delight after the session. ''That was good
fun,'' he said. ''It was very exciting and the crowd was great. I think
you would call it good natured-ribbing. I enjoyed it all.
''Last year we had 3.5-litre engines. This year, we have only
three-litre engines, so it is very impressive. And I certainly won't be
crying if it rains tomorrow, although I understand the forecast is for
warm weather.''
Schumacher said he suffered from incorrect gear ratios for the circuit
and was unable to make the most of his power. ''It is a bit
disappointing for us as I hoped we would do more, but we know what we
have to do tomorrow,'' he said. Leading provisional qualifying times:
1, Damon Hill (Britain), Williams, 1min 44.932sec; 2, David Coulthard
(Britain), Williams, 1-45.306; 3, Michael Schumacher (Germany),
Benetton, 1-45.505; 4, Mika Hakkinen (Finland), McLaren, 1-46.291; 5,
Jean Alesi (France), Ferrari, 1-46.356; 6, Johnny Herbert (Britain),
Benetton, 1-46.381; 7, Gerhard Berger (Austrian), Ferrari, 1-46.482; 8,
Eddie Irvine (Austria), Jordan, 1-46.916; 9, Olivier Panis (France),
Ligier, 1-47.372; 10, Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Germany), Sauber, 1-47.769;
11, Mark Blundell (Britain), McLaren, 1-47.854.

GEORGE ELIOT: A Biography.
Frederick Karl
Harper Collins, #25.
WHAT'S in a name? Quite a lot in the case of Mary Anne Evans (1819-80)
who first used the name George Eliot in 1857 in a letter to the
publisher of her Scenes of Clerical Life. The most obvious significance
of the pseudonym was in the first name which celebrated her life with
George Henry Lewes.
As for the surname, Frederick Karl suggests it has no significance,
being ''truly nondescript''. However, David Williams's biography of her
life with George Henry Lewes -- Mr George Eliot (1983) -- interpreted it
otherwise. It was, Williams argued, a code name acknowledging a debt.
Eliot derived from L I O T, meaning: ''It is to L (Lewes) that I owe
it.'' Sounds right.
Eliot's career as a novelist coincides with the time she spent with
Lewes: her first novel, Adam Bede (1859), appeared after her decision to
move in with Lewes who survived her last novel, Daniel Deronda (1876),
by two years. After his death she died as a creative artist. The two
Georges created a house of fiction between them, so much so that Lewes
referred to Eliot fictions as ''our'' novels as he had suggested scenes
and written bits and pieces of description and dialogue. Behind one
successful woman there was a devoted man.
Although both Eliot and Lewes were moralistic Victorians, their
unmarried status -- Lewes could not obtain a divorce from his unfaithful
wife -- caused distress to the novelist. She could cope with the
hypocritical disapproval of fellow intellectuals but was more vulnerable
to the attitude of her family.
Evidently Eliot thought Lewes was a worthy altar on which to sacrifice
her respectability. He was a talented and resourceful man whose own
writings remain impressive for their argumentative clarity. From an
early age Lewes wanted to make his mark as a writer though his talents
were more analytical than creative.
At the age of 25 he wrote an autobiographical novel, Ranthorpe (1847),
which begs the question ''is therefore genius a fatal gift?'' In his own
case the question was academic but he was well-placed to encourage
genius when it came close to him. It was Lewes who first encouraged Mary
Ann -- or Marian as she subsequently renamed herself -- to try her hand
at fiction.
The theme of Karl's biography is the need of a great novelist to
re-create herself through other characters, in fiction or in fact with
the men in her life from her father onwards: ''When Mrs Evans died,
Marian became Evans's wife in all but bed -- as domestic manager,
companion, reader, tender of the sick man. This position as 'wife' was
then denied her when he died, and she tried to find equivalents for it
in the relationship to Lewes, when at first she served his needs as she
had served Evans's.''
Other men in Eliot's life included Charles Bray, the seductive
freethinker who influenced her outlook on religion; Robert Brabant, the
model for the tiresomely pedantic Edward Casaubon in Middlemarch (1872);
John Chapman, publisher of the Westminster Review which Eliot helped
edit; Herbert Spencer, ''probably the most distinguished man Marian came
close to''. She wanted to marry Spencer but he found her physically
unattractive and introduced her to Lewes who liberated her.
Karl rejects the theory that the novelist was intimidated by the men
in her life. He stresses the inner conflict in Evans/Eliot. According to
Karl, Eliot was able to inhabit other characters and thereby take
creative control of her own life. Thus she remade her father and Lewes
in the image of Adam Bede, a hard man who becomes a sensitive soul under
the influence of the women in his life. Under the influence of Eliot,
Lewes became a new man. He described his change of life on meeting her
as nothing less than ''a new birth''.
When Lewes died, Eliot was too upset to attend his funeral. Writing,
she felt after the funeral, was ''all trivial stuff'' but she persevered
with Impressions of Theophrastus Such (1879) since Lewes wanted it
published. This last work, a collection of essays, features a
philosophical narrator who is partly Herbert Spencer by another name --
a self-centred bachelor and intellectual bully -- and partly Eliot under
yet another literary disguise.
Such puts his cynicism down to experience: ''the illusions that began
for us when we were less acquainted with evil have not lost their value
when we discern them to be illusions.'' Eliot delegated in illusions,
disguising herself as a man when she wasn't and as a married woman --
Mrs Lewes -- when she was nothing of the kind. She had little time to
have illusions about the man she eventually married. Cross was possibly
homosexual, though Karl is careful about outing him, suggesting he may
have kept his distance from younger women because of ''a low-keyed
sexual drive''.
Karl also considers the possibility that Eliot was bisexual but admits
there is no factual evidence for the sexual ambiguity of his heroine. As
an authority on an author he loves, Karl has put Eliot firmly in her
place which is in the fiction she made of the facts of her life.

ASK any Formula 1 fan the question ''who is the biggest Scottish
presence in the sport,'' not surprisingly they will deliver the answer,
David Coulthard.
If you ask a Formula 1 insider the same question, the likely reply
will be: ''Tom Walkinshaw.''
While young David is a talent of great potential, the 45-year-old
Lanark-born Walkinshaw is a major power, not only in Formula 1, but in
motorsport worldwide.
He began as a driver in the late 1960s and eventually formed his own
team, Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR).
Success quickly followed with touring car championships, and, of
course, the legendary days with Jaguar and two world sports car
championships. The Walkinshaw automotive empire now extends to more than
30 companies throughout the world.
He brought Michael Schumacher to Benetton, and it was the Walkinshaw
expertise that unquestionably earned Benetton a championship season in
1994.
Success brings its detractors, but with Walkinshaw on the pit wall,
winning is only a matter of time. While he retains links with Benetton,
he now runs the show at Ligier.
The shambolic remains of the French outfit came under the Walkinshaw
influence late last season, and is starting to get its act together.
How soon could Ligier be in a similar position to Benetton? ''I don't
see any reason why Ligier can't be in the running for a championship
within three years. I certainly expect to win a Grand Prix by then, but
it will take a couple of years to bring everything together.
''You need the right staff, the consistency to challenge. You also
have the media pressure which comes when you start to be sucessful. It
can get to people and it takes time to get used to it.''
Ligier is a TWR project in all but name, and that's enough for
Walkinshaw. ''I don't feel the need to have a team with the TWR label to
demonstrate our ability. The Ligier challenge is a big one, and if we
can successfully run a project as difficult as Formula 1, it is good
commercially for us. It proves we can run a project anywhere in the
world.''
Walkinshaw raced for the first time at Ingliston in an Austin Sprite,
but it was from a single-seater in 1968 that he aspired to reach Formula
1.
''It was an inspiring time for a young Scots driver, because you had
the likes of Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart doing well and I wanted to
follow them.
''I never reached Formula 1 as a driver, but I was a professional for
many years and enjoyed my time behind the wheel immensely.''
Walkinshaw's time behind that wheel has left him with a keen eye for
talent spotting. Michael Schumacher made a sensational Grand Prix debut
with Jordan at Spa in 1991.
Within a week, Walkinshaw pulled off the coup of the decade and signed
him to Benetton. ''I knew he had the potential to be as good as he is
because I had seen him in Group C sports cars. Those 3[1/2]-litre
machines are really two-seater Formula 1 cars.
''I must point out, though, that there are a whole lot of reasons for
his success. First, he had the opportunity to be in the right team at
the right time.
''He has also been handled very well, but to put it simply, he has
been put in an environment where he could deliver his potential.''
Walkinshaw's assessment of David Coulthard is cautious.
''It's difficult to say how good he is, or he will be, not least
because of his team-mate Damon Hill. Since the death of Ayrton Senna, it
is difficult to gauge Hill's progress.
''If we put David alongside an established superstar, we could get a
good assessment of how good he is. My view is that he is certainly Grand
Prix-winning material, but his world championship potential is difficult
to quantify.''
Drivers come and go in Formula 1. Many bring lofty reputations from
the junior formulae and do not make it. Why? Walkinshaw may have the
answer.
''It could be all down to weight. I have noticed that the lighter guys
tend to do well in Formula Ford and Formula 3. If a driver has a bigger
frame, it usually takes the likes of Formula 1 to get the best out of
them.
''I think this phenomenon explains why one guy comes in as a real
hotshot and doesn't make it, while another will come in quietly and do
extremely well. Nigel Mansell's is a case in point.''
The financial plight of the smaller teams on the grid is a regular
cause for concern, but making up the numbers is not on, says Walkinshaw.
''Formula 1 has an image to protect. It's the pinnacle of motorsport,
but it's no secret that there are people out there who are just too slow
and just not competitive.
''Serious people are always welcome in Formula 1 and eventually there
might have to be some sort of qualifying criteria developed for new
entrants, purely to prevent no-hopers coming in.
''From there, perhaps we could then find a structure to help the new
outfits to prosper.''
'It's difficult to say how good he is, or he will be, not least
because of his team-mate Damon Hill. Since the death of Ayrton Senna, it
is difficult to gauge Hill's progress.' WALKINSHAW ABOUT DAVID COULTHARD

* Roger Ormerod. AND HOPE TO DIE (Constable, #14).
PHILIPA Lowe is commissioned to go to a country-house sale to which
her not-quite-yet boyfriend, Oliver Simpson, has independently been sent
already by his firm. Philipa's task is to authenticate or otherwise a
nude portrait of herself attributed to her estranged and now late
husband. The only thing that seems to be wrong with it is that the
distinguishing birthmark under her left breast is missing. The
country-house sale itself has been forced on the family living there by
the apparent suicide of its head and the consequent refusal of their
insurance company to pay up. Philipa is asked to help them prove that it
was murder instead. The main drawback is that the death had taken place
in the traditional ''locked room''. This is enough to tax the ingenuity
of Philipa and Oliver, not to mention that of Roger Ormerod himself . .
. but luckily all three are up to it.
* Mike Ripley. ANGEL CONFIDENTIAL (HarperCollins, #14.99).
FOR those who, like me, have not before met the ''Angel'' of the
title, he is a taxi-driver -- or rather the driver of a taxi. The
distinction is an important one because, while ''Armstrong'' is
undeniably a London black taxi, Angel is not a licensed London cabby,
however often it might suit him to allow himself to be mistaken for one.
It is just such a mistake that leads to his association with Veronica
Blugden, an apprentice PI. She and Angel, however, together with
Armstrong, a character in his own right, and others pursue the purveyors
of assorted villainy, such as phoney religious sects, suspected
drug-running, shady car museums and property market rigging, to an
improbably successful conclusion.
* Tony Aspler. BLOOD IS THICKER THAN BEAUJOLAIS (Headline, #16.99)
AND almost as plentiful! Erza Brant, a Canadian wine journalist as
distinguished as is his creating author, goes back to France accompanied
by Connie, his petulant wife, to buy a barrel of wine from top
winemaker, Jaques Verrier, and thereby take part on the Beaujolais
Nouveau race to London. At Jacques's vineyard Erza finds the first
corpse but almost immediately loses Jacques and thereby has foisted on
him the first of a series of problems that the journalist in him cannot
leave alone. The way Ezra Brant tackles and finally solves the case
makes this book a must for all wine-connoisseurs while, at the same
time, providing education as well as entertainment for those who are
not.
* Barry Norman. THE MICKEY MOUSE AFFAIR (Orion, #15.99)
THIS time a political thriller is something of a spoof too. Unless, of
course, Norman really believes in the cliche that everybody involved in
politics is necessarily corrupt. Archie Beckway, a junior minister on
his way to higher things, is trapped by three crooks, wearing masks of
Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Pluto, into being photographed in an explicitly
compromising position with a fourth, this one Minnie Mouse. The
detective hero, Bobby Lennox, a retired boxer with private means, is
engaged to watch over Archie by a master criminal called Donovan, who
has his own questionable reasons for keeping him out of trouble. In this
Bobby has varying degrees of help and distraction from a series of
ravishing girls. The crucial question is . . . who is Minnie Mouse? The
only really sympathetic male character, not excluding the hero, is the
crook Donovan. But, as you would expect from the TV presenter,  this is
a fast-moving and compelling story.

to allow media baron Rupert Murdoch to keep the American television

* MISLEADING labels on products are the concern of The Cosmetics
Industry Coalition for Animal Welfare. The CICAW are campaigning for a
real cessation of animal testing. They have launched a ''Truth
Campaign'' information pack for retailers which will help shoppers
identify the ''fixed cut-off date'' for cosmetics and toiletries in
their shops.
Observing this date is imperative if companies are to stop misleading
the public, a stance which they only adopt when the public themselves
take steps to convince them they should be telling the truth. The
''fixed cut-off date'' criterion is the only policy which can eliminate
animal testing.
This is because it addresses the cause of the perpetuation of animal
testing: evaluating the safety of new innovative ingredients. In other
words, companies which say that their goods are cruelty-free or not
tested on animals may simultaneously be testing new ingredients on
animals for other or similar products. This is commercial expediency
which allows any company to exploit the genuine concerns of many people
while taking advantage of the latest ingredients developed for the
industry at the cost of animal suffering.

* THE Naff Product Award goes this week goes to Inner Scents. Printed
on cotton with a red lip kiss logo, each T-shirt is impregnated with
pheromone. Pheromones are subtle aromas that are produced by the body
from puberty and act as a secret sexual signal to the opposite sex.
Animal pheromones, like musk, have been used for hundreds of years for
their aphrodisiac properties. So, in effect, the T-shirt -- made in
Essex, would you believe it? -- is every sad person's way of getting a
partner. Completely non-toxic, the pheromone lasts for many washes and
is activated when the body is warm. Available by mail order at #11.99

* Chris Paling. AFTER THE RAID (Cape #9.99).
PALING'S first novel is set in London during the Blitz. It gives
stereotypes such as the chirpy Cockney a miss in favour of what must
approach the reality of dislocation and anxiety, the constant strain and
fear, the horror of digging corpses from the rubble of fired and ruined
buildings.
The opening images are wonderful; the desolation and fragmented
buildings exactly mirror Gregory Swift's state of mind. On the train to
Manchester he meets a nurse who is haunted by what she has seen in
hospital. The couple again meet up with Arnold, a boy they found at the
station. They leave the train at a country halt, where they are
abandoned and eventually separated.
The tranquillity of their surroundings is contrasted with Swift's
mental collapse. His subsequent hospitalisation only increases his
isolation. His hope is to connect with the woman he met on the train;
but rather than a heartwarming ending, Paling stays true to his text and
offers the only solution such a fractured couple could hope to find.
* Jean Rouaud. OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN (Harvill Press, #14.99).
ROUAUD won the Prix Goncourt with his first novel, Fields of Glory,
which concerned the haunting impact the First World War had on a French
family. Anita Brookner said ''it stands out from the normal run of
novels''. The same could be said of its sequel.
It, too, is a place where fiction approaches reality, both a memoir
and a novel of discovery. Beautifully structured and evocative, it does
what novels rarely do, gives the sense of a whole person, a place and
time, so that the three are inexplicably linked.
The narrator's father is a resourceful and energetic commercial
traveller whom we meet in the austere years after the war, hawking
chinaware samples round the Brittany countryside, coming home to help
his wife run their village shop and dying of a sudden heart attack, aged
41.
The narrator trawls his memories for glimpses of his father, gradually
uncovering a hero who survived the German occupation, escaped from the
ranks of French workers conscripted to Germany, and was active in the
local Resistance.
What is wonderful is what he does not tell, but what we know ourselves
-- that the way of life and landscape his father fought to protect was
destroyed after the war, that the old man's Brittany is now a
developers' wasteland.*Aidan Higgins. DONKEY'S YEARS (Secker &amp; Warburg,
#14.99).
Finally, not strictly a work of fiction itself, though it's difficult
to tell. It carries the subtitle of Memories of a Life as Story Told.
Higgins approaches his landscape with claustrophobic intensity, rattling
skeletons and sabres with flourish, recalling his family and childhood
with loving objectivity, bearing all in a way that would make many
fictionalists tremble.

INDEPENDENCE DAY. Richard Ford, Harvill, #14.99 pp 451.
FRANK BASCOMBE first appeared as The Sportswriter, an ex-novelist,
dislocated by the break-up of his marriage and the death of his first
son. What made him exceptional was the way he managed to face the
future, or at least to turn away from his past.
Now we find him six years on, an estate agent, or Residential
Specialist, living alone in Haddam, New Jersey, and struggling with the
same unresolved issues, though he has a new philosophy which is not to
make a big deal out of anything.
Bascombe intends spending time with his 15-year-old son, Paul, an
event ''which promises, unlike most of my seekings, to be starred by
weighty life events''. Before setting off to collect the boy in
Connecticut, he almost succeeds in finding a home for a couple of
no-hopers. Frank is supposed to be good at his job and manages to sell
them a place later, which is pretty good since the action takes place
over the 1988 Fourth of July weekend.
He maintains a desultory relationship with tall, blonde, and leggy
Sally Caldwell, who says her life seems congested. Her husband walked
out 20 years ago after fighting in Vietnam, leaving her to raise their
two children. It isn't love, but it's close, though Frank senses trouble
ahead and they share a disastrous meal when he calls en route to his
ex-wife's home in Connecticut.
The heart of the novel concerns his time with Paul and his
relationship with the boy, who's a burgeoning delinquent. They reach a
form of understanding, despite Frank's concerns about the news that his
ex-wife is going to remarry and the fact that his time with Paul is
abbreviated by an accident which results in the boy having surgery. He
drives back to Haddam where he talks to Sally on the telephone. She
could tell he had been ''vitally moved'' by something ''deep and
complicated'', that he had emerged from his Existence Period and was
probably off and running into ''some other epoch''.
Given the fact that the action takes place during the Bush-Dukakis
presidential campaign and on the most important weekend in the American
political calendar, given the subject, the place, the size of the book,
and Ford's ambition, he seems to be combining a state-of-the-nation
novel with yet another inquiry into the middle-aged and middle-classed,
white American male.
It resembles its subjects in its flabbiness, verbosity and lack of
direction, but most especially in its willingness to settle for the
obvious. Ford never challenges a given assumption, never offers a view
other than orthodoxy. His narrative style would be lost without lists
and when he does offer an existential inquiry he produces some mundane
conclusions.
''A sad fact, of course, about adult life,'' he muses, ''is that you
see the very things you'll never adapt to coming towards you on the
horizon.'' Pages of this kind of nonsense are given the weight, length,
and treatment of philosophical discourses, the kind of thing Frank
promised to quit.
But for all his meaningless introspection, Frank comes across as a
well-meaning and likeable man, a good soul at heart, a dreamer who
strives to rise above the mundane. And even though his children are a
source of anxiety, there is a comic vein which can catch you unaware on
a number of wonderful set pieces, ranging from Frank's disgust at the
boredom of driving and his encounter with the paramedics and Fortress
America following Paul's accident.
Frank's Existence Period is an attempt to re-establish links with his
family and to find a place in his community. The novel ends with the
suggestion that he has succeeded; but, to believe this, we must concur
with Sally's diagnosis, and she is scarcely a reliable analyst. Like
everyone else in this novel she is too self-obsessed, too ready to give
and believe her own opinion, too concerned with her own welfare.

SCOTTISH Value Management yesterday revealed it had raised more than
#26m for its highly-successful Undervalued Assets investment trust
through a placing and open offer, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Of the new money, #20m came from institutions, with existing private
shareholders investing another #6.5m. The capital-raising exercise takes
the Undervalued Assets fund to #86m.
Scottish Value Management, under Colin McLean, has so far proved as
good as its claim that it can identify UK-quoted companies which are
undervalued.
Undervalued Assets' net asset value has risen from 96.1p on launch in
April last year to 112.1p, significantly outperforming its benchmark
All-Share index.
Applications were received for 26.6 million of the 30 million, 100p
units which were the subject of the placing and open offer.
With one unit representing about 0.878 Ordinary shares, shareholders
approved the allotment of 23.4 million new shares at an extraordinary
general meeting yesterday. Dealings are expected to commence on
Wednesday.

TWO major banks, Swiss Bank Corporation and Salomon Brothers,
confirmed yesterday they were under investigation by the Paris stock
market watchdog over alleged insider trading in Eurotunnel shares. Both
denied any wrongdoing.
The Paris regulator, the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB),
this week sent a report to the public prosecutor alleging insider
trading by two banks which took part in underwriting a share rights
issue last year by Eurotunnel, the Channel Tunnel operator. It did not
name the banks.
SBC and Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc, denied any improper
conduct in the rights issue, which raised #816m. They said they would
co-operate with the COB's probe.

THE Stock Exchange is to take no further action in respect of the
National Power and PowerGen share sales and the subsequent sharp fall in
share prices when the electricity regulator, Professor Stephen
Littlechild, unexpectedly called for a tougher pricing regime for the
power distributors.
This follows the release of a review of the matter by the Treasury
which found no evidence of wrongdoing but made various recommendations,
which were welcomed by Stock Exchange chief executive Michael Lawrence
yesterday.
The action of the regulator infuriated institutions, some of which
threatened to sue the Treasury. Mr Lawrence said the release of the
Treasury's statement would allow ''an informed judgment'' of the events
to be made.
The Treasury recommended that the regulator and the responsible
Exchange department consult fully over regulatory announcements. Mr
Lawrence has already proposed that regulators should meet him to discuss
how price-sensitive information should be released. The Treasury
suggested the regulators should consider whether they have appropriate
market expertise.

SOUTH West Water shares fell back 15p to 524p on disappointment with
the Monopolies and Merger Commission's decision on the prices the group
can charge, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Its price cap has been set at inflation plus 1% between now and
1999/2000 and exactly at the level of inflation thereafter. The group
decided to exercise its right to a review by the MMC after the last
pricing proposals from the water industry regulator Ian Byatt, which it
considered excessively harsh.
The MMC has been more lenient but only slightly so, and its review was
welcomed by Ofwat which maintained the MMC's proposed price cap was only
slightly different to its own.
Meanwhile, two English regional electricity distributors, Norweb and
Southern, said they had accepted the price limits proposed by industry
regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild. Norweb said its price limits
would reduce its income by #100m and would mean 450 job losses by March
1997. Its income will fall by 11% or #29m in 1996-97 and a further 3% in
each subsequent year.

THE recovery programme at Burtons continues to deliver slow but
encouraging results. In the 20-week period from the beginning of March
to mid-July Burton Group sales were 1.9% higher than in the same period
last year.
Burton is Britain's second biggest clothing retailer but its margins
have some way to go before they match those of market leader Marks &amp;
Spencer. In the period under review, Burton's gross margin rose by 3.7%
although this improvement is not expected to be sustained throughout the
year.
The company, which used to be known for its perennial sales, is
successfully managing to get people to shop in its stores at full price
for longer periods.
In a trading statement, Burton Group said its continued drive towards
prime trading and away from discounted sales was having a beneficial
effect on margins through reduced markdown. During the 20 weeks, the
fashion stores traded at full price for 79% of the time compared with
51% last time.
''Brand building has helped improve performance. The businesses now
have the building blocks with which to deliver a more acceptable rate of
return in the future.''
Within the group, Debenhams continues to be star performer helped by
stronger own-brand development and the introduction of ranges by
well-known fashion designers such as Ben de Lisi and Lulu Guinness.
Sales were mixed in its other outlets. Top Shop/Top Man and Principles
continue to build on the improvements reported at the half-way stage in
May and Dorothy Perkins is beginning to reverse the decline of last
year.
Burton Menswear, which became too fashionable last year and
subsequently alienated its traditional customer base, is also starting
to show an improvement in trading.
Total costs for the year to September 2 are anticipated to be broadly
level with last year -- forecast to rise by about 2% after stripping out
last year's 53rd week. Capital expenditure on modernising and renovating
stores is expected to be around #120m for the year.
Broker BZW is looking for Burton Group to increase its annual profits
to around #82m from #39.4m in 1994 with the possibility of a profit
upgrade. Against the background of a more favourable consumer
environment in 1996 and 1997, Burton should be capable of delivering
further recovery albeit more sales than margin driven. This augurs well
for the shares, which yesterday added 2p to 97p.

<HEADLINE>General bad-debt provision raised by #120m ready for higher interest rates. Lloyds reports impressive profits</HEADLINE>

LLOYDS Bank chief executive Sir Brian Pitman has aligned himself with
Bank of England Governor Eddie George and the other interest rate hawks
in the City of London in being cautious over the outlook for inflation.
Sir Brian pointed out yesterday that inflation had edged up over the
past three months. It was now more than 3% and continuing to rise, and
lately he considered there had not been as much action as he would have
liked, a clear indication that he would have sided with Mr George in the
debate over interest rates.
He was talking on publication of the group's first-half results, the
first to appear from a large clearer. They looked impressive, with
underlying profits up 19% and a 15% rise in the interim dividend to
8.6p.
But there was some surprise that the general provision against
possible bad debts had been raised by #120m. This was done as a
''measure of prudence'' because of the current economic cycle.
Sir Brian said it was impossible to tell what part of the cycle the
economy had reached or what shape it would take. He still hoped for a
flat cycle.
Lloyds clearly thinks the day is not far away when interest rates will
have to rise sufficiently to tip the economy into recession and so
restrain inflation, and it is preparing the ground for this.
However, Sir Brian said the key indicator of higher inflation to come
would be a rise in house prices and there was no sign of this. He
indicated that there was considerable scepticism overseas about whether
Britain had really got away from its old inflationary habits, and his
tone suggested he was pretty sceptical too.
The increase in the general provision was in line with current Bank of
England thinking. Earlier this year executive director Brian Quinn
called on banks to make provisions at the time loans were made rather
than increase them all at once when economic conditions worsened.
The banks were hit very hard in the last recession, when Lloyds'
provisions for example topped 4% of its loan book, and they are keen to
smooth the bad debt profile, and therefore their profits, in the present
cycle. This is certainly Lloyds' view, but it may have been encouraged
to tuck the #120m away because of the spare #193m it had available from
the sale of its stakes in 3i and Standard Chartered.
Analysts were doubtful if other banks would follow Lloyds' example,
not because they disagreed with the philosophy behind it, but because
they considered their provisions sufficient. Another problem is that
only specific provisions can be allowed against corporation tax so the
mix of provisioning is important.
At the same time as the general provision was increased, specific
provisions in the UK were down from #184m to #140m as overall credit
quality improved. This helped pre-tax profits to rise 21% to #735m in
the first half. Before provisions, ongoing businesses pushed profits 19%
ahead. As a result of lower recoveries from problem country debt
provisions, total specific provisions were higher at #141m against
#102m.
UK retail banking and insurance was a strong performer, raising its
trading surplus by 26% to #483m on the back of higher volumes and tight
cost control. The bank said its focus on the personal sector and small
and medium-sized businesses was behind its success. It has been
encouraging small businesses to replace overdrafts with fixed-rate
borrowing with considerable success. Now more than half is on this
basis, which is seen as a ''healthy trend''.
Despite lower margins on mortgages, net interest margins held up well.
There was a rise in current account balances, partly as a result of a
flight to quality after Barings. Savings deposits fell as a result of
the attractions of equities.
Lloyds is looking forward to an increase in its mortgage business
following the acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society
which takes effect on August 1. The bank is already gaining market
share, with mortgage balances up a tenth in the six months, twice the
industry average. This trend is expected to continue given C&amp;G's
competitive position. As the lowest cost provider, its rates are
typically [1/4]% below the competition. Integration plans are apparently
well advanced and several bank branches are already offering C&amp;G
mortgages.
Corporate banking and treasury profits were down 12% at #151m owing to
higher development costs to support the core dealing and electronic
banking businesses. Private banking and financial services were also
down because of lower activity in securities markets. International
banking more than doubled its contribution to #66m, largely reflecting
recovery in the Brazilian associate.
Sir Brian is quite right to be wary about the Government's commitment
to low inflation, given the almost irresistible temptation to try and
inflate its way to popularity, particularly via the housing market. If
financial institutions and others can keep up the pressure then the
Government will be more likely to continue to act responsibly.
As for Lloyds itself, the results were well received, with the shares
up 16[1/2]p at 680[1/2]p, but there is some division of opinion among
analysts, with some expecting the group to regain its premium rating,
while others feeling it will be constrained by relatively low capital
ratios.

will improve the appearance of the breast, not so's you'd want to take
it out and show it off at parties, mind, but so you feel better about
yourself.
Used on Vichy guinea-pigs, although in this case they'd have to be

Anvar Khan consumes chocolate and bananas in the interests of research
into the ravages of time, but still enjoys a glass of the amber nectar
A VISIT from an emissary from the Body Shop recently left me pondering
on nature. The thrust of laboratory work in cosmetics is to allow women
to fight it, to stop the creasing of the skin on the face (lessened by
sleeping on a satin pillow, apparently, which makes sense if you
remember how much of existence is spent in the sack), to stop the
creaking of limbs, the lines around the eyes, anything, in fact, which
highlights the horrible fact that time is passing and one is
rollercoasting toward death.
The thrust of Body Shop care, however, is a complete reliance on
natural ingredients. They use warfare techniques much more so than the
whitecoats administering pain to huddles of small furry creatures in
cages. The Body Shop respect the enemy of time, the elements, the earth,
befriend them and turn them against themselves.
The Body Shop rep was Dr Barbara Brockway, who describes herself as
''a boring chemist trainspotter''. She told that the Body Shop to look
at past works such as those of Mrs Beeton in the 1880s for inspiration.
In this way they educate themselves in food, enzymes, herbs, natural and
time-honoured remedies.
But Dr Brockway has a great job. Last week, she told me, she was
knee-deep in 50 kilos of strawberry juice. The Body Shop always work
with raw matter.
''We are one of the few British companies who manufacture and
export,'' she said. ''Rivals sell throughout the UK, we sell abroad.''
She visited The Herald to promote Body Shop banana products and made
me eat some (banana, that is) and a snifter of chocolate so I could
understand the similarity in both foods' ability to produce a feeling of
wellbeing. It worked. Then she told me that Cadbury, Rowntree, and Fry
were companies started by Quaker families who wanted to promote an
alternative to beer. Presently, millions of tonnes of chocolate are
annually consumed in Britain. In the twentieth century, chocaholism is a
disease. Well, at least their intentions were good. But some of us still
believe that chocolate cannot compete with beer.

MICHAEL FORSYTH is becoming endearingly mischievous. His appointment
earlier this week of Sunday Times commentator Gerald Warner as special
adviser was the equivalent of administering a laxative to Labour and the
SNP.
On cue Shadow Scots Secretary George Robertson spewed forth that
hiring a right-wing ideologue ''gives the lie to the claim that Forsyth
has learned from his past failures'', while SNP leader Alex Salmond
burst forth with the condemnation that this ''extraordinary appointment
shows Forsyth's mask is slipping''.
But just when they thought it was safe to venture out, the Scottish
Secretary yesterday appointed another special adviser, Brian Meek, The
Herald columnist and -- say it quietly -- pro-devolutionist and honorary
vice-president of the left-leaning Tory Reform Group. The groans of
constipation returned.
Of course, Forsyth could well have announced the appointments the
other way round. That, he anticipated, would not have been as much fun.
Nor would it have guaranteed as many column inches in the newspapers or
soundbites on radio. This was media manipulation which would have made
Max Clifford blush.
After all, when did anyone apart from political aficionados know the
name of a Secretary of State's special adviser, a post as mysterious and
indeterminate as a character from a Michael Dobbs novel. One of the best
in recent years has been Graham Carter, the right-hand man of Malcolm
Rifkind; shrewd, astute, and wise beyond his years but totally invisible
from public view. Warner and Meek will be about as invisible as the
Scott Monument in Princes Street on a clear day.
Although they sit on opposite pews of the broad church of the Tory
party, they do share an acerbity and wit which has been gravely lacking.
They are being tipped as the new St Andrews House equivalent of Laurence
Marks and Maurice Gran, those irreverent co-authors of ITV's sitcom, The
New Statesman.
You can be certain that in future their fingerprints will be found on
all Forsyth's speeches. After all, this will be an important factor in
the Scottish Secretary's attempt to regain lost ground in Scotland. If
poor presentation, rather than policies, is at the heart of the Tories
problems then Forsyth now has two men who can sharpen and hone the
message he needs to get across.
Both will feel it was a pity they had not been appointed a few days
earlier. Otherwise they would have devastatingly mocked this week's
''exclusive'' in the Scotsman which must have startled the nation by
revealing that 20 years ago, as a student at St Andrews University,
Forsyth had actually written a pamphlet extolling the virtues of an
Assembly. Apparently this would now ''haunt'' him. Probably as much as
student communist Denis Healey was haunted when he was Minister of
Defence or at the Treasury.
Their remit, however, extends beyond lampooning the Government's
opponents. They will be expected to submit proposals and alert Forsyth
of the political implications of Government decisions. Viewing
everything from different political perspectives, it is hoped, might
anticipate possible banana skins. As one party wit put it: ''When Gerry
hangs abortionists from the lamp-posts at least Brian will be on hand to
cut them down.''
This is a reference to Warner's opposition to abortion, one of the
many strident views he holds. Although a Roman Catholic he has called
for the sacking of Cardinal Basil Hume for showing sympathy to
homosexuals. He has also attacked nursery education proposals, scorned
''neanderthal socialism'' north of the Border and attacked the Scottish
press, including The Herald, for their ''whingeing'' and opposition to
Government initiatives. Forsyth does believe he gets a bad press and
shares the contempt for socialism, but his views do not reflect
Warner's.
What the two men do share is a tenacity of purpose and the belief that
the Tories can be revitalised. Warner will play a pivotal role in the
Tory courting of the Catholic vote, although some might regard it more
as a ''rough wooing''. The previous Scots Secretary, Ian Lang, had long
been dismayed at the tendency for many Catholics to see Labour as their
natural party when on many issues, like the maintenance of fee-paying
religious schools, the Conservatives were more sympathetic. It was to
this end that preliminary talks were held with Cardinal Winning, and
Forsyth is keen to see this strategy pursued.
As an academic, Warner was the author of a history of the Scottish
Tory party, and has vigorously argued that the party's roots are deeply
embedded in Scottish soil. On a number of occasions he has traced the
genesis of the Scottish Tories to the Jacobites who opposed the 1707 Act
of Union as a sell-out by corrupt Whig landowners.
As ''Cockburn'' of the Sunday Times Scotland diary -- a kind of pukka
Tom Shields (if that is imaginable) although not as funny -- he reported
on many society figures and met many of the movers and shakers of
Scottish business life, another constituency which Forsyth has still to
win over. The Conservatives' relationship with leading businessmen has
been seriously damaged, and unless the Scots Secretary can prove that he
will be more than an 18-month wonder a number have stated privately that
they will continue to keep their distance and court Labour.
But it will be on Brian Meek that Forsyth will depend to build bridges
with the party faithful. Meek is a man of many parts, not just a
journalist but an Edinburgh Tory councillor and rugby enthusiast, who
had handled press relations for the Scottish Rugby Union and who is a
highly entertaining after-dinner speaker.
He played a seminal role in Malcolm Rifkind's early days and remained
close to him when the Pentlands MP became Secretary of State for
Scotland. His wit, ease of mixing at all levels, and his political
acumen is celebrated throughout the party, although some have viewed him
with suspicion because of his pro-devolutionary fervour and -- as Herald
readers will know -- his insistence on speaking his mind, even if it is
against party policy.
Many expected him to be a favoured candidate for Lord Provost of
Edinburgh under the new unitary council set-up but the Conservatives did
badly at the local elections, although arguably better than in other
parts of Scotland. Had he become the city's first citizen he would have
been the architect of a host of projects to raise the capital's profile
along the lines of Michael Kelly's ''Glasgow's Miles Better'' campaign.
It is this innovative thinking, along with his facility for tapping
into the genuine concerns of people, which will be invaluable for
Forsyth, providing him with an accurate barometer of public opinion.
But it is Meek's expertise in one area in particular which has
attracted the Secretary of State -- local government. Forsyth needed
someone on his team who knows his way around the councils. This is
crucial if the Scottish Secretary is to achieve his aim of devolving
more power to this level, thus further blunting the attraction -- and
even the credibility -- of Labour's proposed Assembly, while avoiding
the pitfalls. It would be ironic, indeed, if the devolutionist Meek
proved to be the Assembly's Trojan horse.
''Many people will regard Gerry and Brian as chalk and cheese,'' said
a senior Conservative last night. ''But that is what the Secretary of
State wants. He does not want yes men. He wants those with strong views
yet able to debate them intelligently and have enough nous to think
through the implications of policy.
''Too often a good idea falls flat because it is not put across
properly or there are some hidden pitfalls. There are a lot of ideas
about promoting sport, for instance, on which Brian, I should imagine,
will have a lot to say. The Secretary of State has chosen two men who,
like himself, are not averse to a bit of mischief-making. That will make
it uncomfortable for the Opposition. And if Michael Forsyth can get such
publicity for what is basically internal appointments, just think what
will happen when he announces policy.''

ANNA BUCHAN and O DOUGLAS
Wendy Forrester
The Maitland Press, #6.99.
TO HAVE a famous man for elder brother must be a mixed blessing. To
aspire to be a writer when this elder brother is already
well-established as such must have its problems too. Anna Buchan, sister
of the great John, was in both these situations. That she succeeded in
her chosen sphere of homely novels and that the siblings remained
closely attached says much for the personalities of the two and for the
remarkable Free Kirk manse family whence they sprang.
Wendy Forrester tells Anna Buchan's story sympathetically. It's a pity
that this Buchan's books (she wrote as O Douglas) are not currently on
publishers' lists, except for a large-print edition of Penny Plain. It
is frustrating not to be able to judge the inherent merits of her
writing and to have glimpses into plots and characters without being
able to follow them up -- especially since most of her tales were set in
Glasgow or in a lightly fictionalised Peebles.
Anna spent most of her adult life in the Border town where she lived
with a less eminent brother, Walter, solicitor and town clerk, and their
widowed mother. She is known to have raided her own life extensively for
material for her fiction and wrote about it overtly in her
autobiography, Unforgettable, Unforgotten -- a much more revealing book
than her brother's Memory Hold-the-Door.
It is the formative years of the talented siblings which perhaps most
fascinate. Their Free Kirk minister father married their golden-haired
mother when she was 17. This teenager grew into a woman described by her
son John's biographer as ''brooding on past mischances, plans gone awry,
lost opportunities, and foreseeing future calamity with sombre relish''.
How very Calvinistic. John himself referred to his mother affectionately
if sharply as the ''Mater lacrimosa''. The family lived in Pathhead,
Fife, before moving to John Knox Church in the Gorbals, Glasgow.
While big brother went to Hutchesons' Grammar School, Glasgow
University, and thence to Oxford, to embrace and be embraced by the
southern establishment, his sister ploughed a humbler furrow. Her young
adulthood was spent in sharing manse burdens, visiting the sick,
collecting for foreign missions, attending the Band of Hope with grubby,
barefoot children.
In Oxford, John Buchan worried that ''while I am wandering the high
seas and highways of the world my poor old sister should be a 'blighted
being' at home. Drastic steps must be taken of some sort.'' With
generosity and insight, he made her an allowance of #100 to be spent on
or by herself.
Not that Anna was without spirit. Hence her effort at one point to
give her manse surroundings ''a suitable air of romantic depravity'' in
best fin de siecle tradition by burning incense and keeping the blinds
down. ''The effort came to an end when her father fell over a footstool
and shouted, 'Why should we sit in darkness and a horrible stink? Get up
girl, and don't sit attitudinising there.''' This was hardly a typical
Free Kirk environment.
The loss of a brother and sister through illness and second brother in
the First World War must have drawn the remaining Buchans together. In
later years, sister and mother witnessed John's public elevation, first
as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, then as Governor-General of Canada. It's sad to read that the
absurd formalities of the latter position temporarily distanced him from
the sister whom he had so consistently encouraged and cared for over the
years.

<HEADLINE>Investigators brief fiscal over Dounreay 'hot spots'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE procurator-fiscal has been briefed over the discovery of
radioactive 'hot spots' around Dounreay.
Officials from HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate are conducting an
investigation ''into the nature of all radioactive contamination in the
environment'' near the complex.
The local fiscal, Mr Alistair MacDonald, of Wick, has been kept
informed but further investigations will take place before any decision
is taken whether or not to prosecute the Atomic Energy Authority, which
operates Dounreay, for any alleged breaches of pollution laws.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the investigation was being conducted
''with regard to the Radioactive Substances Act of 1993''.
He said the inspectorate ''will consider referring papers to the
procurator-fiscal should they feel there is sufficient evidence of an
offence to sustain a prosecution''.
More than 140 radiating particles have been found on the foreshore
near Dounreay during the last 15 years.
In the past two months, more than 20 areas contaminated with
radioactivity have been discovered during a search near roadways on the
Dounreay site.
Ten of these areas have now been cordoned off.
The Dounreay authorities, who have pledged to clean-up these remaining
areas as soon as possible, believe the contamination could have ''fallen
off the back of lorries'' taking atomic wastes to the plant in the 1960s
and 1970s.
Former managers at Dounreay were recently criticised by two
governmental advisory bodies over their handling of a waste shaft at the
complex.
This shaft contains an unknown mixture of highly-radioactive material
dumped there over a 20-year period.
It was closed following an explosion in 1977, which the advisers think
could be linked to the hot-spot finds.
The shaft is bored into rock near a crumbling cliff face and the cost
to the taxpayers of removing the wastes and cleaning up the surrounding
area has been estimated at upwards of #100m.
This is the second time in three months that the fiscal has been
alerted about possible breaches of law by Dounreay's operators, the UK
Atomic Energy Authority.
Officials of the Highland River Purification Board spoke to the fiscal
in April about the unlicensed discharge into the Pentland Firth of
nitric acid, used in Dounreay's reprocessing plants.
Dounreay spokesman Andy Munn said talks were continuing with the board
about a ''conditioning plant to treat the acid effluents''.
He said the discussions also involved a timetable for the installation
of the plant.

THE American economy slowed sharply in the second quarter, though
fears of negative growth were not validated.
Gross domestic product grew by an annualised rate of 0.5%, its slowest
pace since the final quarter of 1991 when the economy was beginning to
recover from the recession.
The Federal Reserve earlier this month cut interest rates by a
quarter-point for the first time in nearly three years in a
controversial bid to give the economy a boost, but subsequently the
central bank's Chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that activity was
recovering again.
The big question is how far the economy will bounce back again and
whether the Fed will have the scope to reduce interest rates further.
Many Wall Street analysts believe the Fed funds rate could fall in
stages from its current 5.75% to 5%, but others have questioned the
wisdom of cutting rates at all.
In the first quarter GDP increased by 2.7%, but the subsequent
slowdown is being blamed on a sharp decline in production for
stock-building, especially in cars and trucks.
The second-quarter report from the Commerce Department showed prices
remained well in check and indicated consumers were starting to spend
more freely.
Without the cutbacks in the automobile industry, GDP would have
expanded at 1.9%, according to official calculations. Businesses
increased inventories at a $30.4bn annual rate, down sharply from
increases of $51.1bn in the first quarter and $49.4bn in the fourth
quarter of last year.
Weaker production for inventories acts as a drag on growth. Department
officials said the second-quarter slowdown in the rate of inventory
accumulation was the sharpest since the fourth quarter of 1990.
The second-quarter GDP estimate is preliminary since the statisticians
do not yet have figures on international trade or inventories during
June. It will be revised twice in the coming months.
Two inflation measures in the second-quarter GDP report pointed to
moderating prices. The implicit price deflator slowed to 1.3% in the
second quarter from 2.2% in the first, while the fixed-weights measure
of price changes rose at 2.7%, compared with 3.3% in the first.
Spending by consumers, which fuels two-thirds of national economic
activity, picked up in the second quarter. It grew at a $22.6bn annual
rate, up from $14.3bn in the first quarter. That was still only half the
rate of growth in spending in the final quarter last year when GDP was
growing at an annual rate of 5.1%.
James Capel's David Bloom said the US economy was on track for above
trend growth in the third and fourth quarters.
''If this is the worst the mid-cycle inventory correction can do, the
Fed may lament cutting interest rates so hastily, especially since the
Commerce Department estimates that a large chunk of the slowdown comes
from the autos sector which has already shown signs of rebound.''

A SCOTTISH doctor, described as a ''messenger of death'' by Zimbabwean
prosecutors, was granted leave in Harare yesterday to appeal against his
conviction and sentence for unlawfully killing two young patients in his
care.
Anaesthetist Richard McGown, 58, who was born in India of Scottish
parents and educated in Glasgow and Edinburgh, was sentenced in January
to six months in jail with hard labour and fined #800 or another six
months in prison for causing the deaths of two children through
excessive morphine doses and inadequate post-operative care.
Supreme Court Judge Ahmed Ibrahim said in his judgment yesterday that
it would be desirable for the appeal court to consider McGown's case,
saying it was an ''unusual one, without precedent'' for which there was
no ''normal'' sentence.
No date was set for the appeal. A legal analyst said it was likely
that it would not be heard for a further year. McGown, who lives in an
exclusive suburb and drives a Bentley, has been granted bail until then.
''What is likely to happen is that they are going to go through the
whole trial again,'' one analyst said.
McGown had pled not guilty to culpable homicide and was acquitted on
three similar counts. His application for appeal was turned down, with
High Court judge Paddington Garwe saying he had no reasonable prospects
for success. The Supreme Court later overturned the ruling.
Justice Ibrahim said there was merit in the defence's submission when
it sought leave to appeal.
The defence had argued that a difference of opinion in the trial
judge's judgment and the prosecutor's regarding the cause of death in
respect of one of the children illustrated the difficulty the court
should have had when it concluded McGown had no reasonable prospect of
success on appeal.
The case of McGown caused a sensation in the former British colony of
Rhodesia after a parliamentary committee alleged he had killed patients
between 1986 and 1992 while testing the side-effects of spine-injected
morphine doses on women and children.
Although charges of ''Nazi-style experiments'' and racism were made in
the Zimbabwean parliament, the prosecution said when the case went to
court that it had no evidence that the doctor was experimenting when
five of his patients -- three blacks and two Zimbabweans of Greek and
Asian origin -- died.
McGown's trial in the High Court drew widespread demonstrations by
university students, who labelled the doctor a racist. Most of his
patients were black.
McGown's family returned to Scotland from India when he was two and he
went to Glasgow Academy and later to Edinburgh University, where he
graduated in medicine in 1959.
He trained as an anaesthetist in Sweden and, after short periods in
Scotland, Barbados, and Zambia, moved to the then Rhodesia in 1968 with
his wife, Sheena, a nurse from Aberdeen.

<HEADLINE>Thatcher's NHS reformer 'driven to drugs'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977158283</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE main adviser to Baroness Thatcher for the former Prime Minister's
health service reform spun a web of falsehood to hide his chronic heroin
addiction, a dependence partly caused by the abuse he suffered over his
NHS role, it was claimed yesterday.
Clive Froggatt had claimed he was secretly obtaining diamorphine
through forged prescriptions from different chemists to conceal the fact
he was treating the late MP for Cheltenham, Sir Charles Irving.
In fact, barrister Rosalind Foster told the General Medical Council's
professional conduct committee that Froggatt was getting between 66 and
166 milligrammes of the drug per day to satisfy his own addiction.
The committee heard that one of the reasons he had started taking
drugs was the amount of criticism he had to take because of his helping
to reform the NHS.
It decided to refer his case to the GMC's health committee ''to decide
whether his fitness to practice is seriously impaired due to
ill-health''.
He will be prevented from prescribing drugs and carrying out any
clinical practice until his case is considered.
Miss Foster said Froggatt, 47, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on
April 28 this year. He pleaded guilty to eight specimen charges of
obtaining drugs by deception and was sentenced to 12 months'
imprisonment, suspended for two years.
The charges represented the tip of the iceberg of the doctor's drug
problems, which appeared to date back to 1990, said Miss Foster.
At the peak of the doctor's deception, he was visiting up to four
different chemists in one day. In October 1993, for example, he
presented a total of 4710 prescriptions for 151 patients.
Froggatt, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, used the names of
people long since dead and close friends, without their knowledge, to
obtain the drugs.
Miss Foster said that, during interviews with police, Froggat, of
Hatherley Road, Cheltenham, had lied extensively, although eventually he
came clean and admitted his addiction, claiming, amongst other things,
that he had taken to cocaine followed by heroin after his failure to be
elected president of the Royal College of General Practitioners.
His heavy involvement in the NHS reforms and consequent unpopularity
among sections of the Health Service had also contributed, said Miss
Foster.
His excuse using Sir Charles was exposed when the Cheltenham MP was
interviewed by police and said he had never received any diamorphine
from the doctor.
Miss Foster said the doctor's massive heroin addiction must have posed
a serious threat to his patients.
She told the committee there were several extremely serious aspects to
the case involving Froggatt, not least of which were the huge amounts of
drugs involved and the fact that the NHS had been deprived of funds
through his deception.
Also, she added, he had used the names of nine of his patients and had
implicated those of them who were still alive in what was a sorry
affair.
Mr Anthony Arlidge QC, representing Froggatt, said one of the reasons
he had started taking cocaine and then heroin was the abuse he had
received because of his major role in the reform of the NHS.
He had pleaded guilty to offences of deceit which were brought about
by the consequences of his addiction to heroin.
''Both cocaine and heroin are known to be highly addictive over a very
short period of time and there is no doubt that his addiction was very
serious,'' said Mr Arlidge.
However, he added it should be remembered that, as far as he was
aware, there had been not a single complaint from patients that Froggat
had mistreated them.
After the hearing, the doctor said he was happy with the decision.
''I am extremely grateful for the very serious and detailed
consideration it has given to my case,'' he said. He was not currently
taking addictive drugs and ''sincerely hoped'' he would never be tempted
again.

<TEXT>
A FORMER senior nursing officer was found guilty yesterday of raping
four women patients at a psychiatric hospital over a 10-year period.
Norman McBain, 70, had denied the charges before the High Court in
Airdrie that he had committed the offences at Kirklands Psychiatric
Hospital, Bothwell, Lanarkshire, where he worked between 1969 and 1979.
The four women -- three of whom are no longer patients -- told the
court how McBain, of Hilton House, Hilton, near Banff, Grampian, forced
them to have sex at various places in the hospital over the years.
The rape allegations came to light when one of the women, who is still
a patient in Kirklands, Miss Z, had a breakdown in 1992 and told staff
of the sex attacks carried out when she was still a teenager.
Giving evidence during the three-day trial McBain had described his
victims, now aged 62, 59, 50, and 37, as ''sub-normal and apt to
fantasise''. His defence QC, Mr Gordon Jackson, claimed McBain's victims
had the mental age of children.
McBain took up the post of senior nursing officer at Kirklands in
1969. He had a flat at the hospital and regularly visited areas reserved
for women patients and women's bathrooms which had no lock, the court
was told. McBain retired in 1979, aged 54.
The court heard that McBain had told one of his victims, Miss W, now
59, that she would not be released from hospital if she spoke of her sex
ordeal.
The jury of 10 women and five men took an hour-and-a-half to find
McBain guilty on all four charges of rape, all unanimously.
Following the verdict the judge, Lord Gill, described McBain's actions
as a ''grievous breach of trust''.
Sentenced was deferred until August 18 to allow Lord Gill to study
background reports, including a psychiatric report.
He remanded McBain in custody until then.
McBain was led to a waiting police car with a blanket over his head.
Later his lawyer, Mr Joe Beltrami, said it had not been decided yet
whether an appeal would be launched.
Last night Lanarkshire Health Board's chief executive, Professor Frank
Clark, refused to comment on the case until sentence is passed.
A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing in Glasgow said: ''It is
a terrible thing to have happened.
''This man was put in a position of trust, and especially when working
with vulnerable people, that trust should be carried out to its fullest.
''Those people should not be put at risk like that. It must now be
looked at how best to screen people for employment.''
Norman McBain began studying to be a nurse as a teenager in the early
years of the war, only breaking off to serve in the Army in Burma.
He quickly rose through the ranks of the nursing profession, and
specialised in psychiatric nursing.
He held posts in Scotland and England helping to look after patients
with learning disabilities.
In 1969, aged 44, he was promoted to senior nursing officer and given
charge of Kirklands Hospital.
According to McBain the wards were largely ''closed'' when he took
over. But he introduced a programme of reforms which allowed patients
greater freedom.
The post of senior nursing officer involved McBain and his wife Ena,
now 67, being given a flat at the hospital.
Witnesses told how McBain had free and easy access to all areas of the
hospital, and because of his duties, could be in any part of the complex
at any time of the day.
The sex allegations only came to light when a woman who is still a
patient at Kirklands saw him years later when he returned for a
Christmas party.
The woman, Miss Z, now aged 37, had a breakdown. It was when staff at
the hospital tried to find out what was wrong that she accused McBain of
the sex abuse, carried out when she was still a teenager.
Former patients who had lived at Kirklands during McBain's reign were
interviewed by the procurator-fiscal in Hamilton.
The conviction hinged solely on the evidence of the four women.
Each was judged for their suitability to give evidence.
Psychiatric reports showed that though they all had learning
disabilities, each knew the difference between the truth and lies.
There was no police involvement in the questioning of the victims.
The first time McBain knew his past had finally caught up with him was
when Grampian Police came to arrest him at his country home near Banff.
He appeared on petition last August and was allowed bail.

AS the world ruling body of athletics intensified its pressure on
drug-reprieved Diane Modahl yesterday, British anti-doping chiefs
revealed a significant increase in adverse findings in UK sport.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation confirmed that it was
considering a third test on the urine sample of the former Commonwealth
800m champion despite a British appeal panel having cleared her of any
offence this week.
The IAAF wants further tests to determine whether heat could cause
excessive testosterone levels, adding substance to the view that they
will push to have the appeal verdict overturned.
Medical evidence introduced by the Modahl camp persuaded the panel
that the high levels could have resulted from unrefrigerated storage at
the Lisbon laboratory where the sample was tested.
The IAAF general secretary, Istvan Gyulai, said yesterday that a new
test would show whether the levels had been caused by heat or were
already present in Modahl's body.
Confirmation that the 29-year-old Sale Harrier's ordeal is far from
over came as the Scottish Sports Council confirmed that its anti-doping
initiatives had detected almost double the offences of last year -- up
from four to seven.
Overall in Britain, offenders increased from 43 to 67, mostly as the
result of a campaign against the abuse of social (rather than
performance-enhancing) substances by young professional footballers.
The intensification of tests at football training grounds in England
resulted in 13 positive findings, according to the annual report of the
Sports Council's doping control service.
Eight of those linked players to marijuana, four involved stimulants,
and one was for narcotic use. Only powerlifting produced more positives
-- 16 -- and all but three were for anabolic steroid offences, which
carry lengthy bans.
The seven caught in the Scottish Sports Council's anti-doping net came
from fewer tests than the previous year -- from 443 tests in 27 sports
at 150 different venues. Last year 511 tests were conducted.
Four of the seven were stimulants found in proprietory medication,
however, and could have been taken accidentally. A total of 28% of tests
were out of competition. The most frequently tested sports were
athletics, cycling, football, rugby, and weightlifting.

Shooting stars aren't quite what they seem, finds John Fowler
HERE we are back on solid ground. After whizzing us around space in
search of cosmic thrills, illustrator Mark McLellan brings us down to
earth again. We stand on the sea-shore (Millport it isn't, unless that
whale has strayed into the Firth of Clyde), gazing out over the darkling
ocean, when suddenly a bright streak flashes across the sky -- a
shooting star.
It's one of a cluster visible this month in the neighbourhood of the
constellation Perseus -- hence named the Perseids.
Shooting stars -- also called more prosaically meteors or meteoroids
-- deserve the name only in part. They certainly shoot, careering across
the heavens at high velocity. But they are not in the least like stars.
In fact they aren't like anything much; just bits of space debris shed
by comets in their passage round the sun, usually when breaking up. Many
meteoroids are no bigger than a grain of sand. They show up as shooting
stars when the earth passes through a drift of debris, and they appear
for about 10 nights in succession with the peak of activity about midway
in the sequence. The Perseids will be at their best in mid-August.
Never confuse a meteor or a meteoroid with a meteorite (it could be
dangerous). The crater half a mile wide in the Arizona desert was caused
by the impact of a meteorite many thousands of years ago. This gigantic
hole goes by the name of Meteor Crater, which of course is a misnomer --
strictly speaking it ought to be called Meteorite Crater.
When Mark was in New York last year he visited the Hayden Planetarium
where he saw the largest meteorite on public show, a black lump more
than a metre long, pitted with numerous holes like a petrified sponge.
This object was brought to the States by the American polar explorer,
Robert Peary.
Things from outer space can create quite a mess -- even comets which
seem to be somewhat flimsy and insubstantial things. The European probe
Giotto which sent back pictures of Halley's Comet in 1986 confirmed that
the nucleus is just dirt, rock, and ice. Just over a year ago the comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted with Jupiter, with spectacular results. The
comet didn't literally smack into the planet (which is composed mainly
of hydrogen and helium gases) but was catastrophically torn apart on the
outskirts by Jupiter's gravitational pull before impact a year later.
In pre-nuclear days -- in June 1908 -- an explosion on the scale of an
atom bomb sent shock waves booming over the Siberian forest. No crater
was caused at Tunguska but the trees were flattened within a radius of
12 miles, felled in a neat pattern resembling the spokes of a bicycle
wheel. The devastation is thought to have been caused by the break-up of
a portion of the comet Encke.
Most comets follow elliptical orbits, with the sun lying off-centre.
When they come close to the sun its heat causes them to releases gases
and dust which stream away in a shimmering tail. Some comets take almost
an eternity to return. Encke orbits the sun in a little more than three
years.
The Perseid shown in Mark's illustration is a tiny fragment from the
comet Swift-Tuttle, which made a rather disappointing appearance in
1992. Maybe next time around it will provide a better show, though none
of us alive today will see it. It's not due back for another 128 years.
Research: Mark McLellan.

* YOU'VE got to hand it to them -- collectors of the awkwardly named
Railwayana are persistent. An article in a recent Antiques Trade Gazette
tells the story of one of their Holy Grails -- a GWR brass cabside
number-plate bearing the number 4000. This apparently had started on a
locomotive no.40 built at Swindon in 1906. In 1912, it was renumbered
4000 and the locomotive bearing that number stayed in operation until
1957. Then the plate, highly valued by collectors because there are only
four known plates with three noughts in the number, went missing.
It was tracked to New South Wales where it had passed into the
possession of a man who passed it on to his ex-wife as part of the
divorce settlement. The lady in question had re-married, her new name
was not known and the trail went cold again.
Then, by a fluke, a collector saw the elusive plate leaning against
the counter of a Sydney antique shop where it had ended up after a house
clearance. The story ended -- for the meantime -- in a Sheffield auction
this June, when it was sold for an astonishing #7200.

JOHN Wilson, formerly Head of Music, Craigie College of Education,
Ayr, has died.
He was educated at Ayr Academy, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music,
and Jordanhill College of Education before returning to Ayrshire to
pursue his career, teaching in several schools before being appointed
head of music in Marr College, Troon, in 1959.
When Craigie College opened in 1964 he was appointed principal
lecturer in music, a post which he held until his early retirement in
1979.
During his time at Craigie he organised two national music education
conferences which helped to revolutionise the teaching of music in
Scotland's schools. For more than 20 years heenriched the lives of
hundreds of music lovers throughout Ayrshire.
He held several organist posts, and was conductor of the Ayrshire
Symphony Orchestra throughout the 1970s.

<TEXT>
FINANCIER Peter Clowes, convicted of stealing #16m from his investors,
has been awarded legal aid to challenge the parole board's refusal last
week to grant him an early release.
His solicitor, Mr Milton Firman, said: ''We appealed (against an
earlier refusal of legal aid) on the basis that Mr Clowes was at risk of
being treated differently from everybody else purely because of his
notoriety.''
Clowes, 52, formerly of Prestbury, Cheshire, has served one third of
his 10-year sentence for theft and fraud following the collapse of his
Barlow Clowes empire in 1988.
He is in Sudbury open prison, Derbyshire. Papers have been lodged with
the Appeal Court in the efforts to secure parole.
His legal aid could now pay for further representation in court by
Cherie Booth QC, wife of Labour leader Tony Blair. She put his case at
the unsuccessful challenge to the parole board last week. The board
thinks Clowes should serve more time.

EDINBURGH-based Bell Lawrie White, which held firm in the face of poor
stock market volumes earlier this year, limited the fall in interim
profits at stockbroking and portfolio management group Brewin Dolphin
Holdings.
London-based Brewin Dolphin, which acquired Bell Lawrie from Hill
Samuel two years ago, suffered a 21% fall in pre-tax profits, from
#2.55m to #2.01m, in the 29 weeks to end-June.
The decline is effectively even greater, given that this year's
interim period, which marks the change to a calendar-year reporting
period, was two weeks longer than the previous one.
Brewin Dolphin, which was floated in June last year, announced an
interim dividend of 2p. Its shares lost 3p to 150p.
Managing director John Hall claimed Brewin Dolphin had not suffered as
badly as some other securities houses from poor volumes and low prices
in the first quarter of this year. Weak prices depress fee income.
Mr Hall said: ''One of the parts of the group that has performed most
strongly over the last six months has been Bell Lawrie.
''It has been very resistant to the downturn in volumes. That has been
very helpful in keeping our performance ahead of the market norm.''
Brewin Dolphin's decline in earnings was also arrested by the
contribution from recent acquisitions, which added #243,000 to pre-tax
profits.
Abtrust Bell Lawrie, the Aberdeen stockbroker in which fund management
group Abtrust and Brewin Dolphin each hold a 50% stake, acquired a
similar-sized business in the north-east city from Allied Provincial
Securities last October.
In December, Brewin Dolphin purchased an office at Marlborough in
Wiltshire from Butterfield Securities. It opened a branch in Lymington,
on the south coast, in April.
Mr Hall revealed Brewin Dolphin was looking at further acquisitions
but would not say where.
Business in the second quarter was ahead of the previous year but was
not sufficient to compensate for the decline in first-quarter
performance. The first three months of the previous year were
particularly strong.
Brewin Dolphin, now trading ahead of last year, is ''quietly hopeful''
about stock market prospects. It expects healthy corporate earnings and
does not foresee a further hike in UK interest rates in the near future.
During the 29-week period, funds under management rose 15% to #5750m
with the FTSE-100 index, which did well during the second quarter, up
11%.

When BBC radio turns the clock back 50 years this weekend to
commemorate its first Light Programme, Jack Webster will tune in to the
memories.
THERE was a time, before television, drugs, mindless violence, and the
break-up of the family unit, when life was a neatly ordered and
harmonious business. It was a time when, in the common danger of
history's greatest emergency, wartime people had learned to speak to
their neighbours, help each other, and behave towards their fellow
humans as civilised people should.
But that was 50 years ago -- and much has changed in a troubled world,
not least in the field of entertainment where bewildering choice now
leads human attention in a multiplicity of directions.
In simpler times, the airwaves belonged mainly to BBC wireless, with
Big Ben measuring out our days on the Home Service and lighter fare
coming through the Forces Programme.
The Second World War was scarcely over, however, when that Forces
Programme changed its name to the Light Programme, a mixture of music,
comedy, and the old Radio Newsreel, to which the whole nation was tuned
in a sense of unity.
That change, in fact, took place exactly 50 years ago today, in the
week when the new Labour Government took office, and just two weeks
before the surrender of the Japanese brought the war to an end.
So, at a time of anniversaries and not a little nostalgia, listeners
are in for a feast this weekend as the BBC marks the 50 years since a
man called Norman Collins founded the Light Programme.
It lasted for 22 years, until the corporation gave up names for
numbers and started calling it Radio 2, now well established and still
highly popular as the middle-of-the-road service, symbolised by names
like Terry Wogan, Ken Bruce, Jimmy Young, Ed Stewart, and David Jacobs.
But it is the texture of its predecessor which will dominate Radio 2
this weekend, ranging from Mrs Dale's Diary and Two Way Family
Favourites to The Billy Cotton Band Show and Take it From Here.
My own favourite, I suspect, will be Music While You Work tomorrow
afternoon, when Victor Silvester Jnr will direct his father's style of
strict-tempo dance music, a sound which will almost certainly stir me to
action with an imaginary partner, cutting a neat figure on the
living-room floor while hoping that neighbours are not watching.
It all gets under way this morning when Ed Stewart pays a fond return
to Children's Favourites, the programme in which Uncle Mac presented the
youngsters' requests. Ed will feel not too far from home since he
himself presented the Junior Choice programme which succeeded it in
1967.
That is followed, at 10am, by an archive edition of Saturday Club, a
single programme which included, would you believe it, the live
appearance of The Beatles, Cliff Richard, the Everly Brothers, Roy
Orbison, Frank Ifield, Kenny Ball's Jazz Men, and Kathy Kirby.
A visit to Mrs Dale's Diary of the 1950s will not only stir a memory
for the devoted millions, but remind us how far we have come from the
family atmosphere of Dr Dale and his family which was not untypical of
the time.
Indeed, this whole weekend of Light Programme recollection tells of a
Britain from a very different age. Listen with Mother (1.45pm) was a
time when children really did ''sit comfortably'' and listen with
mother, instead of being abandoned at a box for the sake of peace.
Comedy begins tonight with The Navy Lark and continues tomorrow with
Round the Horne and Take It From Here, with Jimmy Edwards, Dick Bentley
and June Whitfield.
A repeat of The Billy Cotton Band Show tomorrow afternoon will stir
envy in many a television star of today when it is recalled that upwards
of 20 million people used to tune in to this radio programme, responding
to the leader's call of ''Wakey-Wakey!''
Cotton's son Bill was soon to become a power at the head of the BBC.
And Scotland took pride in the fact that the band-show's glamorous
singer was none other than Kathy Kay, wife of Scots comedian Archie
McCulloch and mother of young Ken McCulloch, who would rise to give us
such gastronomic havens as One Devonshire Gardens and the Malmaison
restaurants.
That splendid and grossly under-rated broadcaster Chris Stuart will
bring much of this anniversary weekend together when he devotes his
Sunday morning to the people and programmes who shaped up the tone and
character of the Light Programme.
But for me there is one programme above all which will recreate the
style and tenor of the time. On my very first visit to Broadcasting
House, London, 45 years ago I joined the audience of Grand Hotel, in
which the Palm Court Orchestra was under the baton of the great Tom
Jenkins.
Jenkins' fame was surpassed only by that of his predecessor, Albert
Sandler, who had set this fashion in 1925, when he began broadcasting
from the Grand Hotel at Eastbourne.
And on this special night, the BBC takes us back to that famous south
coast hotel, where the London Palm Court Orchestra will celebrate the
70th anniversary of Sandler's first broadcast.
This fine venue used to boast a clientele with great names like Elgar,
Caruso, and Beecham. Claude Debussy completed his Symphonic Sketches
''La Mer'' while staying at the hotel.
This was the light classical genre of Eric Coates and Albert Ketelby,
Noel Coward and Ivor Novello, which became an essential part of the
British musical fabric, now much and sadly neglected.
But I'll be listening for a treat, putting the musical seal on a
wireless weekend to remember.

GOLF is without a doubt one of the world's great levellers.
Particularly in Scotland, it remains a game for everybody irrespective
of class, creed, or the colour of your Pringle. Unfortunately, like many
of the best things in life, golf the sport has been hijacked by a
minority, and has become golf the status symbol. The further south you
go, the more it's an entry requirement for The Old Duffers Society than
a sport.
This image has undoubtedly alienated many normal people from golf
clubs, and is an unfair representation of the sport in general: many use
the Old School Tie as a badge of acceptability, but no-one would suggest
that education is nothing but a Toff's pursuit, not least because no-one
outside of the cast of EastEnders uses the word toff anymore.
Golf is a unique game, where everyone can compete on equal terms.
Which other sport has a universally accepted handicap system? In theory,
a completely untalented player could take on Greg Norman and still have
all to play for coming up the eighteenth. That doesn't happen in other
sports.
You don't see Rangers giving Arbroath a two-goal start when they play
in the cup, and you won't see Stephen Hendry having to play some
also-ran with a paper bag over his head.
Our foremost golf clubs encourage the right sort of chap to join, they
take considerable amounts of money from him, and then make sure that he
can't have a drink in his own clubhouse bar and feel comfortable at the
same time. Why any man should be at all interested in another man's mode
of dress is completely beyond me, unless he's dressed ridiculously
enough to merit a few jibes while he's just about to putt.
Many people waste time and energy getting uptight about the
reactionary, bigoted nature of the stuffier clubs, but it's not
something that I can get worked up about. That our golf clubs are run by
old dodderers is probably a blessed relief for our society.
If these old men didn't have golf clubs to run, what would they do
with their time? The danger is that if they didn't concern themselves
with banning jeans from the clubhouse bar, they might try to get some
power out in the real world. If these committees exerted any influence
in our streets, can you imagine the havoc that would ensue? Ladies would
have restricted shopping times and people would be banned from our
public parks if they were not dressed suitably.
The game was never about exclusive posh clubs. St Andrews, the home of
golf, is not only the world's oldest, and probably best, course, it's
still a municipal course. There are some things that money can't buy,
and because it belongs to the town of St Andrews, the Old Course will
remain in public hands. In this mercenary age, is it not refreshing to
see that some things remain unadulterated?
The corruption of golf as a tool for social advancement was obvious
during last week's visit to the Open Golf Championship. The crowd was
mainly made up of normal, ordinary, everyday people. Admittedly there
were quite a few Americans but, by transatlantic standards, even they
seemed to be quite normal. You could spot the Yanks right off: they were
the ones continually weeping because it was Arnold Palmer's last Open.
There's Arnie's last opening round (boo hoo); there's Arnie's last wave
to the crowd (wail); there's Arnie taking four shots to get out of a
bunker (cue uncontrollable grief).
I can sympathise with an outpouring of emotion from some people when
faced with the inexorable decline of man with time, but if you're
reduced to tears when you see some old walnut of a golfer decide that
he's not good enough to win the Open any more, then you have an urgent
need to pop down to ''Lives'R'Us'' and get yourself one pronto.
Among the vast majority of normal fans were a hard core of people who
were obviously out of place on a golf course. The rise of corporate
entertainment may be unstoppable, but if it means that there will be, as
there was last Friday, several prats hanging round the fairways shouting
into mobile phones, then maybe someone should have a good try.
It's not as if it was an emergency. Most of the calls involved telling
Julian in the London office how pissed Trevor got the previous evening,
and making sure Diane knew to make sure Jeffrey had the Mallington
contract ready by the end of the day. It says much for the manners of
the average golf fan and player that the tosser avoided getting a
special BT suppository.
The most moving facet of golf as a leveller was the public way in
which its favourite sons are eventually humiliated. No matter how good a
golfer the tragedy of the middle-aged competitor is that self belief
never fades, while skill inevitably does, and the disparity between
ambition and capability is surely the bitterest thing for any of these
previous world-beaters to take.
Walking along watching the professionals at work was a sobering
experience. There are several species of bird that would struggle to fly
as far as a professional's drive, but when you see the concentration in
the average pro's face, you realise that it's not all fun. They take an
age to play each shot, each of them having his own pre-shot routine but,
apparently no matter how cold and wet you are, it would appear to be bad
form to shout ''get a move on'' while they're preparing to play.
What the professional golfer needs is to get more enjoyment back in
the game, and the biggest thing they lack is any decent banter. I
watched Tom Watson play for a while, and his putting was about as good
as Stevie Wonder's. Having missed a few short ones, he obviously got a
bit rattled, and his play gradually deteriorated all week.
In my experience, a round of golf is enhanced by a bit of male
repartee, and what Tom needs is a caddie who will be happy to laugh
loudly and call him a big poof if he leaves a putt short. Other choice
examples of male wit would help to diffuse the tension, and Tom would
almost certainly stop missing the short ones.
As we left the Old Course, having had a great day out we were handed a
leaflet. It was from a corporate hospitality agency, who had just
clinched an exclusive deal with St Andrews Links Management Committee.
Despite the fact that it is a municipal course, optimal tee-times will
be sold to those rich enough to pay over-inflated prices, instead of
being open to the people of St Andrews. Perhaps there are still some
places where fairness matters more than money. Sadly, the Old Course is
no longer one of them.

MY big, spanking mountain bike was recently stolen from the landing
where it was padlocked outside my front door. When a detective called he
said he had a drug addict in custody who had admitted he'd taken it
during the night. It had been reset and I won't get it back. Bikes are
currency in druggie society. He sold it for #30 for a fix. But his
injection cost me #500 for that's what the bike was worth.
Only a month or so ago my partner and I strolled into a newsagent's in
Glasgow's West End around 9.30pm to discover a man and woman aggravating
the Sikh owner. ''What was all that about?'' I asked, as Cruella de Vil
and her beau shuffled out the door. ''They were trying to sell me
heroin,'' he said. He keeps his kids in the back. But sometimes the
tenants of the flats above send their children out to buy bread or milk.
As soon as a child is old enough to go into a shop alone, he or she is
already vulnerable to drug culture. Drug addicts are desperate people.
Some of them sell to children already.
Ordinary citizens do not want to live under lock and key, but
defendants and apologists for Glasgow's hard or soft-drug culture insist
that addicts should have their freedom. The caring moral guardians blame
the Government for not having enough money to give to rehabilitation
clinics, for not providing those dependent on Temazepam with treatment.
They criticise the police for prosecuting dope smokers. In short,
blaming everyone but the user himself for his habits. Personal
responsibility is at a premium in the drugs debate.
Not so long ago, a Glasgow drugs worker, Ms Maxie Richards, said in
the Evening Times that the publication of post-mortem examination
results would be a small step towards awakening the public to the
seriousness of the drugs problem in Scotland.
''Why is it that we don't investigate these matters fully?'' she
asked, using the royal ''we'' while speaking for herself. (Moral
guardians always use the royal ''we'' because it suits them to believe
that everybody shares their views.) ''Is it because drug addicts don't
matter? I'm afraid it is,'' she lamented.
I, for one, think that the public know all about the menace of
hard-drug addiction, I know of other people who have been robbed by
addicts. Do ''we'', then, think that the fate of drug addicts should be
relegated in importance to the lives of drug-free citizens?
Yes, many ordinary people trying to go about their daily business,
bringing up a family, waiting for a bus, all do believe, and I think
quite reasonably so, that they have the right to a decent life without
the added fear of violence, theft, or intimidation.
Especially when the sole cause is a stranger's decision to inject a
lethal drug which he or she cannot afford in terms of health or finance.
And don't give me that rubbish about alcohol and cigarettes being just
as bad.
There are very few people banged up for attacking a man to get money
to buy 10 Silk Cut.
Any deadhead who wants to get out his face regardless of who he or she
hurts in the process is a selfish moron. However, you need hours
practising the art of drinking spirits to become an alcoholic and
experience a hedonistic buzz. You need only half a dozen injections of
heroin before you have to take heavier cocktails to achieve the same
high with drugs. Alcoholics have a life span, hard-drug addicts
regularly injecting live as long in comparison as the midge.
I spoke confidentially with a few people who work on or with the
problem of drug dependency. They had a million reasons why the public
should not condemn the drug addict. However, they also admitted that
there were no particular social factors, no common denominator, in the
psychology of the druggie, other than the desire to get high.
It is often the case that some doctors who work with addicts have a
compassionate attitude towards drug culture. There is a generation in
practice who are themselves products of the sixties and seventies, and
probably not averse to a little smoke here and there too.
One told me that drugs can expand the mind, but his archaic attitude
no longer has a place.
Drugs, if they ever did, don't make you clever. If you want
intelligence, get an education. Getting stoned is the drop-out's
approach to FE.
If you opt out of mainstream society, whether you are a New Age hippy,
a criminal, or a drug addict, that society is, by your very vocation,
the first thing you'll turn on. Which is why, basically, I don't have a
bike anymore.

IN the first of a new series, Taking the Plunge (R4), the audio diary
of Alison and Julie's life with a new baby after being together eight
years should be prescribed listening for that unimaginative moral
brigade who hold the view that children should only be born into the
hetero-nuclear model family, believing that any other setup is
detrimental or corrupting to the young.
Producer Jane Ray's choice of this couple was an excellent one: the
two women were funny, honest, and Mabel's contributions were sweet and
hillarious by turn. This was a programme essentially about parenthood,
rather than gayness, although the possible future difficulties were
openly addressed. As with many parents who adopt, the two women have
made the decision to be utterly open when the time comes about how Mabel
came to be born.
''Two mums and no dads'' need be no deprivation when the statement
''she's made our dreams come true'' is uttered with simply heartfelt
truthfulness.
Since I became a radio critic I have heard a radio ballet, a series on
architecture, and now the sound of a baby being breastfed at half past
four in the morning: a versatile medium indeed.
Another new series, Some Tame Gazelle (R4), an adaptation by Elizabeth
Proud of a Barbara Pym novel set in the thirties, is going to prove
addictive. Miriam Margolyes and Hannah Gordon are brilliant as the
unmarried sisters -- it's all crushes on curates, impossible passions
for archdeacons in a tight gentile English world wickedly conveyed in
all its restrictions, gossip, and unspoken yearning.
With what relish the wonderful Margolyes invites the curate to eat
chicken with his hands and politely and devastatingly bad-mouth her
neighbours. Pym has a genius for conveying how decorum and
respectability can stifle the unselfish heart and make loneliness a
constant threat.
Being unsettled has to be avoided when horizons are so limited. Peter
Jeffrey as Henry is a joy, his tactlessness when -- surrounded by doting
spinsters -- he describes how ''we in the church are victims'' is finely
judged: the unthinking comment stings Hannah Gordon's fragile composure.
A terrific production.
In Cover Stories (Radio Scotland) Ian Docherty investigated the
tabloid war with its price cutting and its scramble for readers.
London-based newspapers looking towards the Scottish market put a tartan
trim on what essentially remains an English product.
''Putting a kilt round the papers'' reminded me of the risibly cynical
appearance of a Scottish Sun appearing with a thistle on its front page.
The fundamental role of The Herald and the Scotsman in the Scottish
democratic process as the means of the country interpreting itself to
itself was made evident. This role cannot be replaced by papers like the
Scottish Daily Mail with its token ''Scottish'' interviews and total
lack of any distinctive Scottish voice.
In Bottoms, Beaks, Bellies and Feet (R4) Caroline Sarll concluded her
series about our protruding bits. These delightful off-the-wall
programmes gave us space to consider our relationship and attraction to
our various parts.
Some sweat and work out to flatten tummies to develop a shape that
others might want to gaze upon, while some find a delight in rounder
shapes. I'm sure to the delight of many a male listener one woman sang
the praises of the beer belly. Her favourite pastime, it seemed, was to
curl up on the sofa watching television, her head nestling comfortably
on the cushion that was her partner's paunch.
Victoria Woods's little monologue about her stretch marks was a hoot,
a slightly cringing one, but funny all the same.
More than slightly cringe-making was the consideration of the practice
of foot-binding. The price of tiny female Chinese feet meant the foot
often was so crippled that the toes fell off. Which one would have
thought a bigger turn-off than cellulite by far. I suppose there is a
price to be paid for everything in the illogical world of sensual taste.

After the fiction writing class at Wormwood Scrubs, the post of
Writing Fellow at the University of East Anglia should have been a
breeze. But for Carole Morin it was a sentence of sentences. Here, she
explains why she ended up wanting to machine-gun the entire populaton of
Norwich.
WHEN I was offered the position of Writing Fellow for the spring
semester at the University of East Anglia this year, I ignored the
warnings of previous fellows and decided not to refuse. So what if one
of them nearly went mental, another ran away, and another considered
jumping into the lake because the rest of the faculty wouldn't say hello
to him? Living on the Norwich campus for four months couldn't be that
bad. There's an all-night Diet Pepsi machine that gives change: and the
students taking my fiction-writing course -- no matter how spotty --
couldn't be as boring as the murderers in my class at Wormwood Scrubs.
Soon after I arrived, a mutilated photograph of me wearing shorts in
Barcelona was pinned to the door of the office I inherited from Malcolm
Bradbury. Unpinning the picture, I chipped my Rouge Noir nail polish. On
the back, an academic nutcase had written: ''I hate you''.
A lot of people hate writers, usually because they want to be one.
Everyone has a book ''in them'' along with their liver and kidneys. I
threw the picture in Malcy's bin, then opened the windows wide to
relieve the air of its dated perfume.
As I was thinking up lots of good reasons why artists become
alcoholics, a smiling student came to my door. ''Are you the writer?''
he asked me.
''No, I've borrowed her office. I'm Carina Carew the prostitute.''
Harry Matthews, the experimentalist, used to pretend to be an insurance
salesman when asked at a party, ''What do you do?'' Anyone daft enough
to admit to being a writer can expect the next sneery question: ''Had
anything published?'' How many chefs have been asked: ''Anyone eaten
your nosh?''
The grinning galoot gave me his trilogy to read anyway, saying: ''You
don't look like a writer.'' Hail Mary for that.
On the other hand, being taken for a student is a serious insult. On
my first day on the concrete campus I was thrown out of the staff caff
and sent to eat dog turd and chips ''with the other students''.
I'd eaten this turd at Harvard a decade ago, and it didn't taste any
better with East Anglian ketchup. Surrounded by John and Yoko lookalikes
heaving big bags full of stolen books and soiled underwear, who pay 50p
to hear UB40 (?!) on the juke-box, studentworld hadn't changed. There's
even a blonde who looks identical to a girl who used to be in my drama
class. Alarmingly, it turns out to be the same girl -- she must be a
woman now -- still studying after all these years.
In the corridor outside my office, men with backcombed grey hair and
women with faces like boiled eggs rabbited off in the opposite direction
to avoid me. I refused to take it personally. This rabbit run is the
normal procedure among socially autistic academics. A high proportion of
them are students who didn't have another idea. Thirty years on this
campus (that used to be a golf course) would give anyone personality
problems.
The inmates in an institution are never quite as bad as the staff;
though writing courses are famous for attracting loonies. One of my
poet-murderers in the Scrubs had invited me to move into his cell ''on a
trial basis''.
Superficially, UEA resembles the prison: the students are treated like
shit and the central heating is never switched off.
While in-residence at Glasgow University, Alasdair Gray said: ''It's
always the weirdos who visit you.'' There's the traditional dandruffy
plastic-carrier-clutching student with Ideas who doesn't do Sentences;
then argues that it's part of his Style. There's the jolly out-there
foreign student who wants to know how to Structure their issues. There's
the great galoot with stunning A-level results and a memory like a
tape-recorder who can repeat back what you've just said but doesn't do
spontaneous dialogue.
These visits had a rigid etiquette. The story appeared in my mailbox.
The scribbler knocked on my door and asked: ''Have I got it?'' There are
those who're only going to believe a bad talent forecast; and others who
expect to be complimented for their genius. Like Mystic Meg, I took an
ambiguous guess -- hoping there would be no tears or violence -- but
keeping a hammer handy, just in case.
The interview concluded with an insult. ''So,'' the student said to
me, ''you're a writer? Well I haven't heard of you!'' (I'll take it as a
compliment.) Or, ''I bought your book but I couldn't be bothered reading
it''. (Tee-hee, I still get the royalties.) Or, ''I could write a book
exactly like yours if I felt like it''. (I could never write like you.)
A summons to a creative-writing debate arrived. I was supposed to pay
to listen to a group of people who'd taught writing answer the loaded
question, ''Can Creative Writing Be Taught?''
Evidently. Malcolm Bradbury for one has made a career out of it. But
can it be taught effectively? Imagination is anarchic. The academic
instructor expects to stick to a course outline. This certainty of a
neat set of rules appeals to students whose brains are already
programmed to analyse, not imagine. But rules can make fiction
flawlessly unambitious. A random flick through the work of old boy and
girl, Mark Illis and Suzanna Dunn, on the campus bookstore reveals
remarkably similar sentence structures in bland books with transparent
issues. As aptly named Dean Lorna Sage says: ''There's a true
slipperiness in any text worth its salt.''
Students often ask: ''If Bradbury was any good at teaching writing
wouldn't his own books be better?'' Another professor insists that ''the
best thing about his novels is that nobody reads them''. An Italian
intellectual admitted: ''I read one! He has this useful technique of
announcing a joke at least five pages in advance''.
It's impossible to be a mediocre practitioner but a brilliant
motivator. Though it's likely that famous graduates Ian McEwan and Kazuo
Ishiguro would have been published without Professor Bradbury's
guidance. Who knows, their novels may have been more exciting. As
anarchist Enrico Malatesta said: ''If a man was born with chains on his
legs . . . he might attribute his ability to walk to those very
chains.''
Though the question could be ''Why not teach writing?'' It's as
justifiable an option for a degree course as Renaissance poetry or the
semiotics of the big toe.
My class met once a week at 9am in the basement. There was a bad smell
in the room, possibly because students didn't have time to jump into the
communal shower beforehand. They'd been up all night raging -- or
reading -- and need as much sleep as possible before a hard day's
talking.
My students were familiar with UEA creative-writing structure -- or
the Malcolm Method; photocopied fiction from two subscribers is
circulated in advance; read aloud in the two-hour seminar; then
discussed by the group. Everyone falls asleep until it's their turn.
''So,'' I said to introduce myself, ''write a short fiction in the
first person on losing your virginity.''
''Aren't we going to discuss this?'' Dandruff asked, alarmed.
''In this writing class we're going to write,'' I replied, full of my
own importance.
''I'm still a virgin,'' Smiler admitted out loud.
''Make it up.'' I explained the relationship between autobiography and
fiction -- how the first-person voice isn't really you. Seven-year-olds
understand this, but educated teenagers stress about motivation.
''Who is it then?'' Big Bore asked.
''It's your character.''
''How do I know who he is?'' he persisted, with a face that was asking
for a slap.
''Ambiguity can make art more interesting.''
Outside my window, defecating dogs used the gap between the house I
was paid to live in and the lake. None of their owners carried pooper
scoopers. As the semester progressed, the dogs were still defecating --
sometimes taking a swim afterwards. The students had started wearing
crazy tight shorts to show off their thunderthighs. If I were writing
from life, I'd have to use this scene in my book.
Nick Hornby gave a reading from his novel, High Fidelity, and admitted
that it's made up! A student visited me to complain: ''That guy hasn't
done his research. I wasn't impressed.''
''But surely making it up makes it better? Fiction's supposed to be
invented.'' Unconvinced, she handed in a story about incest -- leaving
me to vomit over the anal research.
Stories about incest were pushed under my door until I felt like
committing suicide. Stories about bored teenagers in a borrowed car
driving to an off-licence made me reach for the iced vodka. The
good-natured-mum-who-wants-to iron-lots-of-shirts story gave me violent
fantasies. Though I would hate to have missed the intriguing tale about
the addictive side of airport prostitution; and two boy geniuses in a
class of 11 isn't bad.
Even though I kept urging them to lie and reinvent reality, they kept
assuring me that ''everything I've written is true''. When I suggested
that anyone stuck for inspiration could steal from other art forms, my
Likeable Lad student confessed to taking a tin of salmon from the Union
Stores.
My colleagues were still rabbiting off in the other direction when
they saw me coming, and even occasionally swinging doors in my face --
but I refused to take it personally. The thought of having to talk and
use the photocopier throws the boiled-egg brigade into a panic attack.
Anyway I'd started jumping into the elevator and using the back stairs
to avoid people myself. Not to mention pretending to be my twin sister,
Carina Carew.
Then I heard that the vice-chancellor didn't approve of me. A meeting
had been held in the coffee-room. My worst offence was that when UEA had
its Teaching Quality Assessment the external examiner graded me
(snigger, smirk) Excellent, while the School was Satisfactory. Instead
of making me want to jump in the lake, this open warfare cheered me up.
I could stop pretending it was nothing personal.
Near the end of my sentence, Hugo Williams -- a former Fellow who has
continued to teach poetry at UEA for 15 years -- cheerfully asked: ''Is
everyone being horrible to you?'' Doing their feeble best. Though the
Vice-Chancellor's racy wife had explained that I was joking when I said
I wanted to machine-gun everyone in Norwich. Doors had stopped slamming
in my face and a few people had smiled at me. (OK, they stank of gin.)
Now school's out. I've escaped the Norwich nightmare. Angela Carter
was an extra in my dream last night. Wearing an alarmingly tight PVC
catsuit, she was driving around the UEA campus in a caddie, hunting down
a cockroach that turned out to be Professor Bradbury.
Angela Carter didn't have a big faculty fan club at UEA until after
she became famous. ''That was when Angela really wanted to kill them,
when they tried to take the credit for inventing her.''

* THE Divine Miss M -- aka Bette Midler -- has at last confessed that
it has all been an illusion. ''That image was a mask. My real self isn't
a character people would pay to see.''
Outrageous diva of the New York and San Francisco bath houses, the
Honolulu-born star is now 49 and admits: ''I'm a walking dichotomy.
Though my image is urban, brash, fast, I have sugar-cane roots. It's a
part of myself I cherish.''
After a couple of movie duds -- deaths in the case of Stella, For the
Boys and Scene from a Mall -- her movie career is back on track with
three films in pre-production and a television thriller completed. Her
16th album Bette of Roses has also just been released. And -- how things
change -- the critics have had a go accusing her of being ''too
mainstream''.
She's not changed. She's just not pushing the bad girl image any more.
She and her husband Martin Von Hasselberg, along with eight-year-old
daughter Sophie, have left Hollywood to live in New York.
''I wanted a life . . . not a lifestyle,'' she says.
Midler, who's been an Oscar nominee (The Rose, 1979), the comedy queen
of Disney (Ruthless People, Big Business), and a feminist champion
(Beaches), talks of slowing down, of learning Italian, and becoming a
gourmet cook. She also talks up a storm about touring with a back-up
band and making movies that matter. Which is it?
''I don't want to have to come back to this planet and serve another
term. I want to do it all now. Though I don't know that he made me in
his image, God is my idol. Besides there's got to be some redeeming
value in all this.''
* FRANK Langella who was a brilliant Broadway and then screen Dracula
a disquieting 17 years ago, is hoping to pull off that difficult double
again starring in Strindberg's classic The Father. First, he will appear
on the New York stage, and then the production will be filmed.
Langella, an engaging actor, has kept busy often as villains in the
movies but also on stage in Los Angeles in productions like Scenes from
an Execution and Les Liaisons Dangereuses with Lynn Redgrave as the
malignant, scheming countess. But who will play Strindberg's scheming
Laura? Director Robert Falls says the search for Langella's co-star goes
on.
* AS does the hunt for new, tantalising villains for Peter Falk's
Columbo to confront. All involved with the shabby detective like the
scripts for his new series of television films which begin filming this
month. It's just finding big-name stars with the time to give stature to
evil. Falk friend and Columbo regular Patrick The Prisoner McGoohan is
set, and there is talk of Joan Collins filling a slot as an evil movie
queen. Liz Taylor, depending on her health, also might make a cameo
appearance.
* WITH the incredible box office of Apollo 13 star Tom Hanks has
nothing but offers. Producer Brian Grazer says: ''He's the most
sought-after star in the world right now.''
But he points out: ''Tom is impeccably scrutinising about which movie
he makes. The back-to-back Oscar winner for Philadelphia and Forrest
Gump happily insists: ''I don't see any reason to play a mad bomber just
for the sake of blowing an image out of the water.''
And he's resisting all attempts for a Forrest Gump 2, saying: ''It
wouldn't be a good movie.''
* WHAT'S in a name? Meg Ryan's latest movie French Kiss was originally
titled Paris Match, but comic-actor and Ryan's When Harry Met Sally
co-star Billy Crystal got miffed. His summer romantic comedy was titled
Forget Paris. Lawyers got involved but Ryan's producer Lawrence Kasdan
simply changed his title and says: ''We got lucky. French Kiss is
better.'' It has also done better at the box office.
* YOU could change the lyrics to ''Yo re mi''. Yes Sylvester Stallone
-- Judge Dredd in his latest movie incarnation -- believes a musical
Rocky would work. ''It's perfect. You have all the different sides like
West Side Story. You've got the girl, the boy. You got Apollo Creed
versus Rocky.''
He'd like Elton John to do the music. Who would play and sing Rocky?
''Oh, no, no, no -- I don't sing.'' Let's hope he's not protesting too
much.
* The latest Hollywood diner joke revolves around the movie Species in
which a human mates with a half-alien. Wags are saying it should have
been titled The Lisa Marie Presley Story.

EVER since I was a little boy in the port of Partick and we used to
run up to sailors in the street and touch their collars for luck -- no
sniggering at the back, please -- I've always had a certain fondness for
the Royal Navy. It seems at the same time to be the most traditional and
the most tolerant of individuality among the Services: bright and
breezy, free and easy.
And although the second voice you hear in the new documentary series
HMS Brilliant (BBC1) was that of a lugubrious matelot pointing out, like
Dr Johnson, that living on a ship at sea is like being in jail with the
chance of drowning, there was an amiable fecklessness (except in point
of duty) about these hearts of oak that was most appealing.
I mean, I bet you couldn't find a single Army barracks where they keep
an electronic parrot called 'Arry (''hello, sailors!'') -- must get one
for the office -- or prepare for a night on the town by dressing up as
cowboys and Indians. Sailors don't care.
Leading seaman Micky Goble, a rustic English butterball with an
attitude of mind reminiscent equally of Sergeant Bilko and Corporal Sad
Sack, was the star of the opening show. A maritime philosopher (''This
ship is like a little bit of England . . . village idiots, mad
scientists, mess-room lawyers, toffs, and a few bog-common dregs like
Marines'') with a penchant for party tricks like stretching a french
letter over his head and blowing it up from inside -- while keeping his
hat on -- he had, like most of the crew, something sweetly boyish and
Peter Pan about him. A thing of duty, as Keats so nearly says, is a boy
forever.
Standing at the top of the gangway as a succession of jolly tars
rolled aboard, in a state somewhat less than shipshape and Bristol
fashion, Micky liberally applied the Navy rule that, if they can get on
board under their own steam, they're all right. A pair of Marines in
lingerie, survivors of a campaign whose battles included the ominously
named nightclub Nemesis, were among the most notable casualties. ''Look
at the killing machines,'' commented Micky. ''Their make-up's running.''
Below decks, the atmosphere was the usual military mixture of
comradeship, bonhomie, malice, and grumbles, but one sensed that for
most of the younger ratings the Navy was the most fun they'd ever have
in their lives: a job to do, friends to do it with, pay for doing it,
and no other responsibilities whatsoever. It's not grown-up, but then I
think British society is too grown-up as it is. God bless them all and
all the ships they sail in: if I weren't a bit old for the recruiting
board, HMS Brilliant might make me run away to sea yesterday.
It should, by the way, be interesting to see how the other members of
the crew develop. Captain James Rapp, for a start, who doesn't even
share a mess with his officers but dines alone (''You need to stand
apart''). Check out next week's episode to see if he's started clacking
a pair of ball-bearings in his hand, or initiated a major inquiry into
the disappearance of a can of strawberries.
Tom Morton, distinguished broadcaster on subjects as diverse (or as
akin) as whisky, pop music, and religion, combines the latter two to
charming effect in The Rock That Doesn't Roll (ITV). The tension between
the devil's music and God's salvation makes him Scotland's answer to
Jerry Lee Lewis, except that no-one's ever found any drowned young wives
in Tom Morton's swimming pool.
TRTDR (for the sake of brevity) opened its account with a justly --
you'll know why I say that if you saw it -- self-deprecating account of
the presenter's 1960s history as a guitar-man evangelist, courageously
reviving such lyrics as Romans 10 and 9/ Is a favourite verse of mine/
Hear the words of praise/ In golden letters shine.
That apart, this first instalment was a touchingly nostalgic
recollection of seaside Gospel missions, anti-pop 1960s prejudice (one
clergyman had his church reconsecrated after Morton's band played
there), and a short history of religion in pop from John Wesley to the
Joy Strings. Anyone with the cojones to appear on Top Of The Pops in
Salvation Army uniform is OK with me.
What makes me the best person on the Herald to review Bob Monkhouse's
stand-up comedy series Bob Monkhouse On The Spot (BBC1) is that I was
born a post-modernist: that is to say, I've always liked cheap trash
since before it became ironic.
Looking at it from a semi-professional point of view, one has to
admire the old sleazeball's sheer professionalism. There is a sincerity
in his insincerity that is positively spellbinding, a callous honesty
about the relationship between audience and entertainer that gains
rather than loses by the blatantly frank admission that it's all just un
job de cash. Here I am, here you are: I'm going to tell some jokes and
you can laugh if you like.
Most of Bob's jokes are too indecent to quote in a family newspaper,
which is just as well, because I was too busy admiring his mechanical
perfection to write them down. This show is the essence of camp, in that
the show is a joke in itself and the audience is in on the joke; but I
think I should also add that it was very funny; and that Monkhouse
eschews racist jokes and the wilder shores of sexism. Goddamnit, he's a
pro.
Meanwhile on Brookside (C4) crisis turned into disaster as per usual
with the mysterious death in the cells beneath the Appeal Court in
London of Beth Jordache (Anna Friel), the abused daughter and co-killer
(with her mum Mandy) of her wicked dad. It was a death as dramatically
mysterious as medically -- Beth/Anna never made a single on-screen
appearance -- which suggests Anna Friel decided not to work her notice.
Can't say I blame her, for Brookie has become easily the cheapest and
cheesiest of the soaps, exploiting rather than illuminating the social
problems in which it majors. Maybe Anna Friel decided to follow the same
policy as Brendan Behan when he was sentenced to death by the old
Official IRA: the sentence was given in his absence, so he invited them
to carry it out in his absence as well.
Two to follow from a better than average week: My So-Called Life (C4),
an American drama about being female and 15 that reminds me, as it will
many parents of teenage daughters, of that famous James Thurber cartoon
to which the caption is ''But what do you want to be inscrutable for,
Marcia?''. And Resort To Murder (BBC1), a Brighton-set murder mystery
that makes good use of that raffish literary legacy of Greeneland
violence and corruption. More of both of these next Saturday: until
then, ciao.

IT IS only in the last 10 or 11 years that I have been using herbs
with such abundance in my cooking. Before then the herb content of my
ingredients was restricted to parsley and chives, with the occasional
use of tarragon.
How times have changed.
I used to try to grow enough herbs for our use, but although basil
would flourish on my windowsills for a while, every summer the same fate
befell my plants, so carefully nurtured. The green and white flies
descended.
The cure for this, so someone told me, was to wipe each leaf with
Fairy Liquid. I didn't see much point in even trying this because I felt
the taste combination of basil and Fairy Liquid unappealing, to say the
least.
Neither Godfrey nor I are noted for our horticultural success, and our
polythene tunnels abounded with dill gone to seed and similar herbal
failures. So you can imagine how great was my joy when Scotherbs, based
near Perth, began to post us vast weeky consignments of a wide variety
of herbs.
The herbs we get each week are parsley, chives, dill, tarragon, basil,
and a small amount of sweet cicely -- use this last herb sparingly,
unless you like a very dominant flavour of aniseed. We grow our own
rosemary and thyme, and have a good supply of bay. The only mint I
really like to use is the broad-leaved applemint, with its
furry-textured leaves. The furriness vanishes as soon as the mint is
chopped or cooked, and the flavour is so much better than either the
common spearmint or Moroccan mint leaves.
Fleshy herbs, such as mint and basil, lose most of their taste if they
are in heat for any length of time. This is why I add chopped mint to
cooked and drained new potatoes, rather than cooking them with a sprig
or two of mint. Similarly, basil must be added to a hot dish at the last
possible moment to keep its flavour. The same applies to parsley. Yet
dill has rather more staying-power, flavour-wise, in heat. The woody
stemmed herbs such as thyme and rosemary, on the other hand, keep their
full flavour.
I have yet to encounter a dried herb which didn't smell and taste of
old grass cuttings. There really is no substitute for fresh herbs, but
some of them do freeze well -- chopped mint and parsley are very
convenient to have stored away in the freezer. Chives also freeze well.
But don't try to chop chives, they are much easiest snipped with sharp
scissors. They need to be snipped even before being added to a
liquidiser or food processor -- otherwise the chives bind themselves
around the blades.
Parsley is a herb which I never think is accorded sufficient merit as
a flavour. It is too often associated with a garnish. For dense taste,
flat-leaved parsley is delicious, and parsley, whether flat or curly
leaved, goes with just about every savoury food I can think of.
There are some herbs which are synonymous with certain foods. But with
a little experimentation their uses can be found to complement so many
other foods -- try chopped dill instead of mint with new potatoes. And
basil was created to be eaten with tomatoes but recently I have been
using basil with salmon and scallops -- a warm salad of char-grilled
scallops with torn basil leaves in the dressing is delicious. It is
better to tear the basil leaves because when metal is used with basil
the leaves tend to turn brownish.
Bay is greatly underused, and it can be used -- in moderation -- to
flavour savoury foods, stocks, casseroles of meat, game, and chicken,
but also can be used to infuse single cream before being made into an
eggy custard for eating with any summer fruits.
Mixed fresh herbs can be used to flavour the batter for crepes. What
you include in this batter depends to a certain extent on what you
intend to fill the crepes with. For instance, when I make smoked trout
and cucumber filled crepes, I use a lot of dill in the batter, with
parsley and chives, too. If I am using a mushroom-based filling, I use
less dill (but some) and thyme.
Herbs are so easy to buy these days, for those of us who don't grow
our own. Any supermarket has a good selection of fresh herbs, and I
can't think how dull my cooking must have been in the days before the
herb abundance.
This week's recipe is for a truly green salad, made with a wide
assortment of salad leaves with a thick avocado and herb dressing. It is
quite substantial, and can be a main course to be served with warm
bread.
A selection of iceberg torn into bits, rocket, water cress, young
spinach, sorrel, nasturtium leaves, flat or curly parsley torn into
small bits, chopped applemint (or any other type of mint). Torn basil.
For the dressing
About 1 tablespoon snipped chives, a handful of parsley, a few leaves
of mint, a sprig or more of dill, 1 avocado, 2 teaspoons mustard powder,
[1/2] teaspoon sugar, [1/2] teaspoon salt, lots of freshly ground black
pepper, [1/4] pint olive-oil and [1/4] pint sunflower oil and about 4
tablespoons lemon juice.
TO MAKE the dressing, put the herbs, mustard, salt, sugar and pepper
into a food processor. Scoop the flesh from the avocado into the
processor and whiz, very gradually adding the oils, drop by drop then in
a trickle. Lastly whiz in the lemon juice, which not only adds a
necessary sharpness but also helps prevent the avocado from
discolouring. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, whiz in a
tablespoon or two of very hot water to thin it down a bit. Serve in a
bowl to hand around with the salad.

THE complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas is a challenge that
has been accepted in recent years by Alfred Brendel, Richard Goode and,
among Scottish-based performers, Gusztav Fenyo. But the sonatas for
violin and piano present a challenge of a different sort -- that of
restraint -- and it was impressively met last night in the first of
three recitals in which Fenyo and the young German violinist, Susanne
Stanzeleit, self-effacingly suppressed their personalities for the sake
of the sort of partnership these works demand.
That is not to say the performances were faceless, however. The
Cottier Theatre, where they took place, is a converted church with
theatrical lighting, raked seating, and clear acoustics that projected
the nuances of the music to fine effect, enabling the players to
concentrate on gentleness of repartee and a light fluency of line.
Though done entirely without eye contact, the performances sounded
scrupulously balanced and integrated.
Favouring a soft-grained yet always lucid approach, the violinist
treated the slow movements -- that of the A major sonata, Op 12, No 2 in
particular -- as quiet, poignant songs. Nothing in the early sonatas was
exaggerated or nudged out of shape, but when the C minor, Op 30, No 2
arrived -- each programme has been designed to end with a major work --
it was placed within more or less the same constraints, and sounded all
the better for it.
This was playing that captured Beethoven's half-lights rather than his
explosiveness. Tonight's and tomorrow's recitals, with the Kreutzer as
destination, should be well worth hearing.

They're the kids from nowhere and they want a big, fat slice of the
fame cake. But first they must lay themselves bare for the ritual
humiliations of the audition. Stephen Ferguson put himself to the test
and found stardom a tempting mistress.
I ALWAYS knew it would happen. I always knew that I was made for
stardom. Even when I was just a writhing, wriggling morsel in a pram,
award-winning, flood-lit fame beckoned. It called out to me. I listened,
I waited, I grew. And now, I have my chance, my once-in-a-lifetime shot
at the big one. Mama, watch me shine.
No matter that I have a face like an anaemic racoon, a voice like Tony
Blair on steroids, a torso the muscle despises, and legs more crooked
than the Kray twins. When you got it, you got it.
Kenny Ireland, prestigious director of Edinburgh's Lyceum Theatre, is
the man who will see it. The ''it'' that separates me -- the chosen one,
the blessed -- from you: the ordinary grubby folk, the ''scumatozoon''
of the world. Mr Ireland (Sir, great man, chief) has agreed to audition
me for a place within a stable of players being compiled to enact three
plays at the Lyceum in the autumn. I've successfully convinced both my
editor and Mr Ireland (ever-wise guru, head-honcho, anointed king) that
it's all in the name of in-depth feature-writing, of solid research --
to understand the ins-and-outs of ''audition culture''; that
never-ending process of tested-then-rejected that thousands of actors
must go through in the pursuit of work.
Not a bit of it. I want my slice of the big, fat fame-cake. And if
anyone stands in my way they'll lose a vital limb. I want it bad. Step
aside, buster, I'm coming through.
I am not the only fully-grown adult with such potentially psychotic
delusions. In fact, we probably all have the feeling that we are made
for something great and profound at some point in our lives -- sadly,
the feeling is too soon obscured by endless banalities and by the pull
of domesticity. Most of us hide it well; the hope that turns to a burn,
turns to a blister that festers deep within, well out of sight.
I dabbled ever-so briefly with the world of amateur dramatics soon
after leaving secondary school, deciding to get out of it after quickly,
and inexplicably, becoming type-cast as an elderly Jewish man. Since
that time all those years ago, I've tried to keep my potential lunacy a
closely-guarded secret.
Actors and actresses are those people in society who parade their
mental aberrations for all to see: the schizophrenia of role-playing,
the Little Napoleon complex (to be found occasionally in the
shortcomings of tall people, too), the visions, the voices, the
dressing-up in abnormal garb. One actress concluded: ''There's so much
fear in actors, they're like wee children, wanting success so badly.
They're completely nuts. You have no idea the things that go on in an
actor's mind.''
The public evidence of insanity lies not only in the acting work
itself but in the ridiculous rodeo that is the audition process: films,
plays, commercials, TV series, soaps, voice-overs -- you name it,
there's a put-your-butt-on-the-line audition to go through to get the
work.
Therein acting professionals inflict endless damage upon themselves
through the receiving of painful rejection after painful rejection. And
yet social services allow them to walk the streets as bold as brass.
Care in the community -- it ain't working.
''An audition is such a frightening thing you've got to be a bit daft
to go through it,'' says Scottish-based actor Ricky Callan, a bit of a
veteran in the television supporting-actor department. ''You really lay
yourself bare; sometimes there is just one person watching you, other
times there will be a panel of maybe five people all watching you, which
is terrible. I don't think I've ever got used to it, but I've learnt to
adopt a persona, I suppose it's a kind of inner strength that I call
upon, and that gets me through it. Although it's scary and daunting, if
you want to get on, it has to be done.''
For a day I join the ranks of the self-evidently unstable, the
obviously deranged. There are around 800 actors out of the 1400 members
of the Scottish branch of Equity, 79% of whom would have registered
unemployed in the last five years according to recent Scottish Arts
Council calculations, and the majority will earn less than #5000 in a
year. Also, there are 10,000 community actors, many of whom have
professional aspirations and carry out paid professional work. A modicum
of competition. So sedate me heavily, show me where to stand, and get a
nurse at the ready, I feel a Shakespearian soliloquy coming on.
On the surface the audition process seems a simple one: the actor
performs two prepared speeches that last a few minutes each, one or more
people observe, the actor chats with said person or people, the actor
goes home and waits by the phone or letter-box. At television auditions
the actor would usually be expected to read a section of the script
instead of a prepared speech, often being recorded or photographed in
the process -- and that would be the only real difference. Where's the
problem in that, you might ask?
Even for actors with theatrical agents, getting an audition can be a
huge problem in itself. Many actors contest that they -- and not the
agent -- invariably do most of the work: the phone-calls, the mailing of
letters and photographs, the networking. And the problems at audition
time usually do not stem from talent; neither the abundance nor the
absence of much-prized ability, but of psychology. And the overcoming of
psychology is one of the main keys to success: exuding confidence in the
face of adversarial fears and doubts, overcoming the silent intimidation
of other competitors while waiting for the actual audition to take
place, and beating back the worry that the physical appearance is all
wrong and the choice of dress a miscalculation. Once over these hurdles
there is also the daunting pyschology of the audition environment to
contend with.
We'll call her Meg; an actress who has just completed a round of
television auditions and didn't want her name to be disclosed for fear
of it affecting her career. A woman, also, with clear thoughts and
feelings on the audition process: ''They sit and play God, the people
who carry out these auditions, and ultimately they will choose somebody
that they know. And as a woman you have to be very careful about how you
present yourself. Too self-assured and you'll get nowhere, because if a
man is auditioning he will think that he won't be able to cope with you.
And if there's a woman auditioning you have to be careful how you look,
because some women don't llke to see other women looking too good. It's
a scary world.''
Fear is a fast-moving train on precarious tracks. Using such a method
of transportation to get to the audition at the Lyceum brings the
metaphor brutally to mind. Once you're on you can't get off, the
rattling must be endured, and the expedient motion tolerated until the
final destination. Would that it were so different. Would that I were
brazen and bold.
Standing in the audition space -- an empty room in the theatre where
Kenny Ireland (Mr Benevolent, Mr Giver of Lucky Breaks) sits like a
casual judge -- I clutch my two speeches tightly as I would a railing
that might stop me from falling. I anticipate sweat. Great sprawling
oceans of the stuff; damning my clothes, damning the carpet.
I fret, I shuffle, I swallow, I raise a dramatic arm. I start to
speak. Bertolt Brecht's Caucasian Chalk Circle -- I play the part of a
philosophical thief. I'm cynical, I'm ironic. Ha Ha Ha, I say with a
devious smile. It's the perfect part once you understand to play the
character as if he's a journalist -- because we're good at cynicism and
irony. Really good, in fact.
The languid reverberation of my voice sounds like the truncated
laughter of many, muffled by as many hands trying to mask their
guffawing mouths. All of a sudden, the train of nerves decides to whisk
my words away, with me still attached. Soon, the speech is threatening
to take off as the train drives through the mass and mess of words at
breakneck speed. We want it over with. We're not happy. We don't like
this at all. Get out of the way, madam, this train's out of control. To
top it all, I'm physically rooted to the spot like a carrot in a
farmer's field -- except for this one demonstrative arm, the one that's
not clutching the imaginary railing, it's waving around like a flag in a
stiff breeze, and my will can't get it to calm down. It's possessed. It
has become a demonic arm.
A broody bit of Shakespeare follows. Hamlet: ''To be or not to be . .
.'' Perhaps you've heard of it. My acting is about as moody as Julian
Clary in a rugby scrum, I imbue the innate wisdom of the text with an
unusual and somewhat fresh flavour of ignorance, and my verse is about
as lyrical as the wording of the New Roads and Street Works Act. A sonic
boom sounds in the room as the high-speed train of my delivery passes
Fort William -- I wave with my one good arm.
Eventually -- divine intervention having missed its cue -- it's all
over. Kenny Ireland (shocked, perplexed, wishing he were somewhere
completely different) musters the response: ''OK, right, fine.''
The judge puts a piece of black cloth on his head, and I get what
other auditioning actors miss out on: dissection. ''It was a little bit
static, you could have added a little more physicality to it. You only
really used one arm -- but it can take years of experience before an
actor can confidently use both arms.'' Forsooth, thou speaketh with a
touch of sarcasm, my liege, and thou hast not given me a part in the
forthcoming production. Rejection hurteth.
Leaving the Lyceum Theatre for good -- never ever wishing to return,
mulling over the idea of torching the damned place to the ground and
dancing on its ashes -- I feel more than a little like an elderly Jewish
man, a feeling I thought I was through with. The audition process
bestows wrinkles, erases hopes, and leaves question marks in the air
that ask what went wrong, what could have been done better, and when
will a bed become free in the local psychiatric ward?
Colin Scott-Moncrieff has it all to look foward to. In July he
graduates from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Now, he is
young, fresh-faced and optimistic. After a year of auditions he could
find he's misplacing his reading glasses, and leaving his teeth on buses
-- unless he is one of the truly determined ones. ''It's quite daunting
in a way. In college we haven't really been taught to handle auditions.
We did something called Professional Practice in third year which
touched upon auditions, and were basically told to be ourselves, and to
choose audition speeches that show off our best abilities.''
The audition process tests the mettle of actors; their most important
asset. Those who make it to the top do so because of determination, and
the ability to take on the audition format and bend it to their will.
And if actors can't handle the insanity of auditions, then perhaps they
would not be able to handle the greater insanity of success that may
come at the end of it.
As for my own high-falutin aspirations of fame, all is surely not
lost. Static is, after all, a start. I can begin with the inert --
corpses, for example -- and work my way up to live things. And if I put
in some work on developing this other arm -- well, who knows?

WITH three companions I spent five days in the West Highlands around
the Loch Sunart area fishing hopefully for salmon and sea trout.
Despite avidly stalking the incoming and outgoing tides in the sea
loch and dutifully attending the brackish waters at the mouths and
pools, in draught and in spate, of two rivers, our catch, midges not
withstanding, was as follows: fish observed leaping, three; fish caught,
two very small sea trout, almost as big as the Toby they pursued.
Maybe it was a case of seven years of plenty and seven years of lean,
''the fishing is not what it wass'', or the fundamental skills were
lacking, but the presence of several fish-farm cages in the loch
engender other suspicions.
In conversation with a local gentleman about the lack of migratory
fish I unwittingly mooted the idea that these cages may well have
something to do with this state of affairs.
I was told that ''there is a lot of myth talked about this, the
reality is distorted, in fact it's a pack of lies''. I subsequently
found out that he used to operate a marine harvesting firm.
Sadly, whatever the reasons, the layman draws his own conclusions.
With regret I will think twice about foraying westward again on a
fishing holiday -- to the detriment of the local economy, bed and
breakfast establishments, and hotels and shops. Instead I'll stick to
the apparently more productive River Kelvin where the only suggestion of
cages are submerged supermarket trolleys.

I WAS interested in the letter from Wm Walker about RSNO ticket prices
(July 22).
If Mr Walker cares to procure an SCO brochure he will find that ticket
prices for senior citizens cost #2.50 for an individual concert.
A series of six concerts would therefore cost #15.
I can assure Mr Walker of a most enjoyable series of concerts.

IN 1993 our consultancy successfully tendered for the review of
Monklands District Council's personnel procedures -- recruitment,
selection, equal opportunities, training and development.
In the light of allegations concerning malpractice in its handling of
recruitment the council was prepared to subject its procedures to
professional scrutiny and to accept the findings of a critical
assessment.
We carried out the work within about six weeks, interviewing officers
and elected members, reviewing written documentation and comparing it to
personnel practice in other organisations.
The report, I believe, was objective and honest, and the council's
personnel procedures certainly did not escape criticism. Nevertheless,
the recommendations that were made were accepted in full.
The criticisms which we made, however, were of a technical nature,
based on experience and informed judgment, unlike the allegations that
went before and which have continued unabated since.
Especially insidious have been the attempts of local and national
press to play the religious discrimination card, or at least has been
the failure to analyse the issue more seriously.
For Frances McGlinchey, the lady who was so incensed on finding there
was a question asking about her religion in the forms she was asked to
complete when applying for a job with Monklands District Council, I
would like to give a clear explanation (July 25).
It is well-known that the council has been accused of showing favour
to Catholics in its recruitment. When my company undertook the review of
the personnel practices we found there to be no statistical evidence
either to refute or to substantiate the accusation, though I can say
that there was no-one among those we interviewed in the council (on
either side of the debate) who felt that religion was an issue.
But nor could we identify the figures on disabled persons' employment
or that of people from different ethnic backgrounds.
Our recommendation, therefore, was that, because outsiders to the
council had raised religion to such a point of issue, the only way to
answer these accusations in the future would be to collect the facts on
a voluntary basis and to be kept strictly confidential to the personnel
department.
The Equal Opportunities form, which asks about applicants' gender,
marital status, disablement status, dependants, nationality, ethnic
origin, and religion, carries no-one's name and is kept quite separate
from the application form: both forms are coded with the same number.
Analysis of applications, short-listed candidates, and eventual
appointments is therefore possible: this enables there to be monitoring
of the effectiveness of the Equal Opportunity policy which Monklands
District Council is trying to achieve.
The sensitivities about any form of discrimination which public
concern causes put a huge burden on all employers, public or private,
large or small.
The Equal Opportunities form which Monklands District Council uses is
the same in all respects as one used by Dunfermline District Council
(and, I believe, some other councils in Scotland).
We hear no outcry from the Fife press, nor should there be any from
any reasonable party. The trouble with the Monklands saga is that it has
brought to the surface too many unreasonable parties.
Though my company's review of Monklands' personnel procedures found
there to be plenty of room for improvement, can anyone honestly say this
would not be the case in many organisations?
Monklands District Council has a lot to be proud of in what it has
done for the people in the whole of its area: someone from the press
should take up this story sometime.
And if it is still trying to tighten up some of its personnel
procedures, please let it get on with this in a professional way.

ROSTISLAV Plyatt is a Russian actor. He also happens to be a Jew, and
is often chosen to play the part in films and plays of good-humoured,
middle-aged eccentrics and intellectuals. All this I am assured by those
who have seen him on stage or screen in his native Russia. The reason I
came to know about him is that I am apparently his double.
This knowledge has not upset me in any way since his characteristics
are not exactly off-putting. Good-humoured? Intellectual? Who could
regard these as other than terms of endearment?
The fact that he can give me a few years and still be my senior, does
not exactly flatter me, but there it is. Humble pie not caviar is to be
my diet.
Recently at a wedding I was introduced to a young Russian woman who
happens to be a danseuse, perhaps not the kind they have in the Pigalle
district of Paris, although one of her friends does actually work there.
''Haven't I met you before?'' she asked.
This could have been somewhat embarrassing, especially as she said it
in front of my wife, but it was actually my Russian spouse who came to
the rescue. ''Perhaps you are mistaking him for Rostislav Plyatt?'' she
suggested. ''That's it!'' cried the danseuse, and I was able to bask
once more in the reflected fame of my thespian double.
By another double stroke of coincidence, the wedding at which this
took place involved an identical twin as bridegroom.
Although I was officiating at the wedding and knew the bridegroom's
brother was to be his best man, I did not know he was an identical twin
until I got some odd and inappropriate responses from the man standing
at the foot of the aisle when I greeted him. Needless to say the best
man made suitable sport with the potential of the situation during his
speech at the reception.
Among the guests at this very same wedding was a man who is the double
of the late Roy Kinnear, who was tragically killed by a fall from a
horse during the filming of the movie The Three Musketeers. Bob not only
has a physical resemblance to the actor but many of his mannerisms.
He used to be asked so regularily for his autograph as ''Roy'', that
he found it was easier to oblige the actor's fans and so he smilingly
wrote ''Roy Kinnear'' and they went away happy. Bob, I should point out,
has ceased this practice since Roy's death. There are enough resurrected
Elvis Presleys out there without adding to the confusion.
However, the device of a double has been used to great effect. During
the last war, General Montgomery used a double to dupe the enemy as to
his whereabouts, as the eminently forgettable film I Was Monty's Double
testifies. Dictators are wont to use the same trick to confuse assassins
and I understand that there are quite a few Saddam Hussein lookalikes
running around in Iraq.
Mind you, considering the sickening degree of adulation which the man
insists upon, the job must have quite a few fringe benefits (unless the
double gets the bullet -- literally).
The Monty Python team once created the vision of an island populated
entirely by Alan Whicker doubles, all running around doing commentaries
on each other.
They were not so much doubles as multiples. The point of a double is
that there is only one. It is not to be confused with the concept of a
doppelganger, which is more of an evil alter-ego. Doubles are friendly
and -- here's the fun -- could swop with each other for a little
holiday.
This idea appeals to me a great deal. Rostislav could take pulpit
supply at Kinning Park. His good-humoured, intellectual sermons would be
greatly appreciated and, while he might be a little weak on the New
Testament, his fiery exposition of the Old Testament would not go amiss.
Meanwhile, I would play King Lear at the Satiry Theatre and enjoy
signing autographs for people who had caught one of my old films on TV.
Of course the idea is not a new one. In the Victorian story Vice
Versa, Mr Bultitude changes places with his young son.
To begin with, each imagines the other has a rather more interesting
life. The son wants to be an important person who is in charge at the
office. The father wants the carefree existence of a child.
Neither is equipped to deal with the new role and the pressures it
brings. It all ends in tears, except that both realise the vision each
held about the world of the other was lacking in understanding because
it lacked the vital factor of empathy.
That story is sometimes used as a parable of the Incarnation. Jesus is
the double. He is what God is like, but in the form of a human. As in
Vice Versa, in the Incarnation, God has actually experienced what it is
like to be human. The Father/Son double act is not so much two very
different people who look like each other, as two aspects of the same
reality.
Jesus invited people to look for his double. When they saw outcasts
and strangers, he encouraged them to recognise him.
The more people who have that kind of double vision, the better for
our world. Most of us tend simply to look in the mirror and are content
with what we see, whether or not it reflects the divine image.

IF Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth truly wishes to demonstrate that
he is genuinely tapped-in and listening (July 27) let him oversee the
return of our water to local authority control lest he be accused of
turning a political deaf ear to the overwhelming will of the Scottish
electorate.

THE Rev T M Cant states his belief that the committees in Church
offices appear to be in control while the voice of the people, the pew,
and the parish is disregarded (July 20).
Maybe that is why the Very Rev Professor James Whyte said at the last
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, ''The initiatives should
come from the congregations, but the thought that the ideas come from
the top stifles this. We need a grass-roots rebellion in the Church.''
I think it is high time the so-called Layman's Kirk had a layman as
Moderator of the General Assembly as at the moment the lay can pay but
have no say.
I also think the so-called Reformed and Reforming Kirk should change
some of its outworn ideas and structures and plan a fight-back against
what Mr Cant called its parlous position; or next winter it should hold
evening classes in making white flags.

THE Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election was an engrossing
political event, full of passion and dirty deeds at, around, and
possibly under the crossroads. As an act of political illumination,
bringing further light to the current state of British politics and the
relevant positions of the parties, it was less helpful. The Government
obviously hoped to catch an electoral breeze from Mr Major's successful
leadership campaign. This was a reasonable expectation as, in the
peculiar way of human nature, anything new, if short of absolute
disaster, appears to attract our attention favourably for a while.
Those last words were crucial to Conservative hopes in Littleborough
and Saddleworth. Regular opinion polls assessing the standing of Mr
Major and his party showed a heartening increase immediately after the
leadership affair, but also registered a steady slide ever since. By
polling time even this ethereal effect had evaporated, though whether
this had anything to do with Chancellor Clarke's botched attack on share
options, and his even more botched attempt to improve the situation, is
not known. This Government has made such a habit of sliding on banana
skins it is possible that banana-fatigue is beginning to affect the
public. That said, the by-election was not a disaster for the Tories,
though arguing this point rather depends on your definition of a
disaster. Neither was it much of a success. The Conservative core vote
appeared to hold firm though the Tories must be worried about the fact
that the Labour candidate appears to have taken votes from both Liberal
Democrats and Tories. Labour will be reasonably happy, but also a little
worried in some respects. Under the tutelage of the implacable Mr
Mandelson, the Labour candidate managed a much larger percentage
increase in votes than that of the Liberal Democrat victor.
Nevertheless, Labour did not win the seat. Nor does the party appear to
have won the number of votes which might have been expected from the
extraordinary effort made during the campaign. Labour's other problem
centred on the deputy leader, Mr John Prescott. Although a fresh and
often invigorating figure, Mr Prescott must take care or he will become
the Kenneth Clarke of the Labour Party. His claim during the by-election
that Labour would win and that it would mark a turning point for New
Labour was very unwise.
It might seem churlish to leave the victors until the end, but
although the Liberal Democrats secured an adequate result their share of
the vote increased by only 3%. As any politician will insist on telling
you, a majority of one vote is enough to win a poll, but while the
Liberal Democrat candidate in particular is to be congratulated for both
his energy and self-control, the result does not provide any new
evidence of a revival for the party. All-in-all it was an inconclusive
affair. The Government's majority in the House of Commons is cut to
single figures for the first time in 16 years and the main parties, with
utter predictability, proclaim themselves satisfied. We do not wish
death or disaster on any MP, but further polls will be necessary before
any new trends can be confirmed.

Johannesburg, Friday
SCIENTISTS said today they had found a missing link between man and
ape with the discovery of four 3[1/2] million-year-old fossilised foot
bones in caves at Sterkfontein near Johannesburg.
''Here in this one combination of four bones, we have a real missing
link,'' said palaeo-anthropologist Ronald Clarke, who has dubbed his
find Little Foot.
''This is a true missing link in that it combines a human type of
ankle bone with ape-like bones leading up to the big toe,'' he said,
running his fingers along the tiny bones.
Professor Phillip Tobias, director of Witwatersrand University
Palaeo-Anthropological Research Unit in Johannesburg, said the discovery
of Little Foot had solved the debate of how hominids (members of the
family of man) started walking upright.
''The new foot bones . . . comprising a row of articulating bones on
the inner side of the foot that leads down to the great toe, provide the
best evidence yet found on this question,'' he said, surrounded by
skeletons, skulls and fossils in his laboratory.
''Our studies of these foot bones show clearly that the early apeman
of Sterkfontein had a foot which equipped it to walk on two feet, as in
humans, but also its big toe was highly mobile and was set at a wide
angle to the toes as in apes.''
Tobias said the find solved the dispute over whether early African
apemen were adapted to walking upright on only two limbs (bipedal) or
whether they had retained some tree-climbing features and sometimes
moved on all fours (quadrupedal).
''It's important because of the light it throws on the way in which
the transition occurred from the quadrupedal gait of chimps and gorillas
to the bipedal gait of humans,'' he said.
''So another decades-long ferocious controversy in the scientific
literature has been resolved by Little Foot.''
Clarke agreed: ''I think anybody who looks at this and denies that we
evolved from the apes clearly hasn't studied it in very great detail,
because it says very obviously that we have a man and an ape in one
individual.''
Tobias added that Little Foot were the oldest foot bones from one
individual found anywhere, as well as providing evidence that hominids
were present in the southern African sub-tropics over 3[1/2] million
years ago.
Little Foot also confirmed what had made the three million
plus-year-old bipedal fossil footprints found by scientist Mary Leakey
in Laetoli, Tanzania, 20 years ago.
''Little Foot thus provides the first evidence of the kind of foot
belonging to an upright-walking creature that could have been
responsible for footprints like those of Laetoli.''
About 100 feet deep in the cave, Clarke pointed earlier this week to
white bones protruding from the red layer of earth from which the Little
Foot bones were unearthed by lime quarry workers in the 1920s.
The discarded rubble lay at the excavation site until the rocks were
chipped for fossils in 1980. But again, Little Foot was overlooked.
The four bones, adding up to about seven centimetres (2.8 inches),
were thought to be just animal bones and thrown into boxes until Clarke
decided to look through them last September.
''First, I found the perfectly preserved ankle bone. When I looked
some more, I found the next bone perfectly fitting into the first. That
in itself would have been a marvellous find. But then there were still
two more. All of them belonging to the same chap.''--PA/Reuter.

THE upstairs space is like a sauna. Bodies, close-packed and steamy
with heat. An ideal ambience for a trip through the mind and times of
the Unnamed Philosopher. Unnamed because official, authorised versions
of the late Michel Foucault's life tend not to dwell on the darker
aspects explored in TV Production's work-in-progress, Brainy, which has
been developed during a CCA residency.
Brainy offers four scenarios, each a nifty pastiche of a theatre of
cinema genre -- which focus on Foucault's personal quest to reach an
understanding of ultimate truths through transgression. He willingly
engaged every part of his being in his bid to move beyond the limits of
conventional morality and social shibboleths. The opening scene finds
our philosopher (Nick Philippou) upside down in an absurd situation,
while his companion (the arch diva, Adrian Howells) knits, and provides
the banalities in their exchanges. A black shadow explodes into the room
and whazam! Our Philosopher is liberated into the pursuit of truth
through actions, not words.
Next stop, Death Valley and LSD, where his mind is blown towards a
realisation of his sexuality . . . And faster than you can say Tom of
Finland, we're cruisin' the gay baths of California to the pumping
rhythms of a city listing sexual activities beyond the scope of this
column. It's dedicatedly graphic, not least in its questioning of
artistic/creative identity and the lengths one needs to go to in order
to discover it.

A NUMBER of serious questions arise from the incident in which Mr
Stanley Windsor is reported as trying to shoot an animal which he could
not identify but thought was ''a species of big cat'' (July 20).
At a distance of about 25 yards, considered a vary fair range for a
12-bore shotgun, he shot twice and wounded twice this creature which
escaped. It would be informative if he described in greater detail his
methods in this expedition.
The sportsman's code is to identify a quarry before shooting. It is
illegal to killmost wild animals and, in any case, people have been shot
accidentally when this rule is ignored.
A sportsman must choose the correct weapon and ammunition for his
particular quarry. It is illegal to use the wrong weapon or ammunition
for large mammals.
A sportsman must pursue wounded quarry by himself or with a dog, to
prevent wounded animals dying protracted and painful deaths. This is not
legally required but observed by any decent sportsman.
I am pleased to read that the police have appropriate tranquillising
guns for occasions such as this.
Finally, my last word is my own opinion and I ask a question: Does man
have the right to kill any or all other animals which threaten his
profits?

CAR drivers' reluctance to signal their intentions is not merely
discourteous it is dangerous.
When I learned to drive hand signals had to be given. Perhaps the
effort required made drivers aware of this need for communication.
Today, the effort is so minimal it comes low down in drivers'
consciousness.
I now play a guessing game: ''He is not signalling but has to be
positioning himself to turn left. But will he do so, or has he been too
lazy to get on to the correct part of the road?'' Or: ''He signals going
right, but has he forgotten to turn off his bleeper?''
When I am waiting to come out of a side street I watch the oncoming
traffic for signals. If only one car is approaching and signalling it is
turning left I should be able to go out with safety. But I do not trust
that signal and wait until the turn has started before venturing forth.
Am I alone in exercising this caution or is there a really widespread
problem here which needs attention?

AS Leader of Central Regional Council I am both delighted and
astonished at Michael Forsyth's complete U-turn on the issue of school
placements.
While I welcome yesterday's announcement that the Scottish Secretary
will address this issue, I question his political motivations.
Central Regional Council has been fighting for a change in this
legislation for some time now -- to the extent that we moved an
amendment in the House of Lords. But our appeal seemed to fall on deaf
ears.
If action had been taken then, problems for schools returning in
August could have been solved by now.
Since Michael Forsyth has never been interested in championing this
cause in the past and since nothing else has changed, I can only assume
that he is starting his election campaign early.
He also decided to make this announcement not directly to the
education authorities but in a letter to a local headteacher. A strange
act for a man so publicly quoted as wanting to nurture a good
relationship with Scottish local authorities.
As yet we have not been told exactly how Mr Foryth intends to solve
the problem of school placements. Hopefully he will listen to our
recommendation that schools be given the power to reserve places for
local pupils and we will stop the ludicrous situation where local
children cannot get into their local school.

THE contribution by John McKay is the sort of emotional outpouring
that makes me despair for the future of Scotland (July 24). One does not
justify socialism by attacking capitalism. It's as logical as defending
the inhospitable cold of the Antarctic by attacking the heat of the
Sahara.
Of course, I'm cynical about politics. Anyone over 18 who believes
what he or she hears or reads from politicians should seek urgent
psychiatric advice. In poll after poll and in country after country
politicians have been rated consistently with insurance agents and
used-car salesmen as the people least to be trusted.
It is nonsense to claim that poverty is a monopoly creation of
capitalism. Regrettably, poverty is -- and always has been -- universal.
And nowhere is it more soul-destroying than under socialism where the
poor are denied the opportunity to drag themselves out of their misery.
Mr McKay's memory should remind him that the socialists who built the
crumbling high-rise ghettos provided no car-parking. Today there are
wall-to-wall cars in the council housing estates and there are more
satellite TV dishes per square mile in those areas than in the
Bearsdens.
His claim about the sacrificing of the ordinary people in war under
capitalism is utter nonsense also. How many of the politicians in Russia
died at the hands of Germans in their battles against Hitler?
In fact, how many generals or their political masters -- in any
country -- have ever died during a war since the harnessing of gunpowder
enabled them to sit in comfort and safety in the rear? Socialist
politicians are no different from any other feather-bedded dictators.
There can be no defence of the extreme capitalism portrayed so vividly
and with such manic glee by the comrades but I have to point out that
socialism has never created anything of lasting value. Not one of the
memorials to the presence of mankind on this earth would have been
created under socialism.
Stonehenge, the Pyramids, the Vatican, the Taj Mahal, the great
cathedrals, the castles that we flaunt to the tourists; even our canals
and railways: not one of these would have seen the light of day under
socialism.
The Russians who had 70 years of uninterrupted socialism have created
nothing. Anything of value that remains in Russia was created under the
vilified Czars. Nothing of lasting value can ever be created unless
capital is allowed to accumulate. The comrades are dedicated to ensuring
that this cannot happen because of the danger that it might enable
someone to raise his or her head above the level of the submissive herd.
Yet the Socialists, whether they call themselves Labour or
Nationalist, never give up. All the present nonsense about devolution,
electoral reform, proportional representation, and independence is never
in a million years going to produce any gain for the folk of Scotland.
What it would do if we were daft enough to vote for it is to lock
Scotland once more into government by the Monklands comrades at local,
regional, and Westminster levels; but this time with the added monopoly
bonus of being controlled by the Edinburgh and Brussels comrades as
well.
Many of our voters have not spent any of their adult lives under
socialism and in their innocence they accept the unsupported promises of
Blair, Robertson, and company. What is really beyond my comprehension is
people like Mr McKay, who have lived in Monklands, Dumbarton, Edinburgh,
and East Lothian, or who have read about the exploits of the comrades in
so many areas. How can anyone still think that it would all be different
if the same people were put in power in Edinburgh and in Westminster?

ONCE a peace process has begun it is easy to forget the enormous
effort which must invariably be made to initiate the entire affair.
Quiet retrospection from time to time should convince those involved of
the dangers of flinging away gains which have already been registered,
but which might appear to diminish in the normal flow and ebb of the
continuing process. To put it simply, any peace process is a rare and
precious thing and this means that small measures, whether or not they
are contentious, are worth making in order to keep everything moving.
The Irish peace process is a perfect illustration of this. The Dublin
Government yesterday authorised the release of 12 more IRA prisoners as
part of their contribution to the ongoing effort. This follows the
decision by the British Government to allow certain IRA prisoners in
British jails to be transferred to jails in Northern Ireland.  In
themselves these moves are not desperately significant. Loyalists might
be upset and the IRA will undoubtedly claim them as a victory. It is
also likely that incremental progress on this front will increase the
pressure on the British Government to respond with further gestures of a
similar nature. Nevertheless this is necessary, not just as a subtext of
the overall process, but at certain times as an important device to
maintain momentum. On the major issues of the peace process, such as the
disarming of the IRA (we dislike ''decommissioning'' because it should
refer only to military arms used honourably) there is clear and
persistent disagreement.
The suggestion of an international body to supervise the collection
and recording of arms recovered is perfectly sensible. It has been
rejected for the moment, possibly so that it can be brought back into
play as a bargaining counter later in the process. Whatever the reason,
progress of some sort must be maintained.

Union, South Carolina, Friday
A MOTHER was sentenced to life imprisonment today for drowning her two
young sons last October.
Susan Smith, 23, was sentenced by a jury of nine men and three women
after more than two hours of deliberations. Her defence lawyer had
pleaded with the jury to spare her from execution, saying her family
could not stand more grief.
Smith stood between her attorneys, staring straight ahead, before the
decision was read to the court. Her lawyer, Mr David Bruck, put his arm
around her shoulder as circuit court judge William Howard pronounced
sentence.
As the judge spoke, Smith smiled gently at Mr Bruck, the man who had
helped save her from the death sentence.
Smith was convicted of murdering her sons, Michael, three, and Alex,
14 months, when she let her car roll into a lake with the boys strapped
in their child seats.
The sentence, voted unanimously by the jury, came five days after the
same jury convicted her on two counts of murder. The jury had the option
to sentence her to death if all members voted for her execution.
Her estranged husband and the boys' father, Mr David Smith, said later
that he was ''disappointed'' at the sentence.
Her mother, Mrs Linda Russell, who displayed little emotion throughout
the trial, cried. She and her son, Scotty Vaughan, were embraced by
well-wishers and family.
Smith's stepfather, Beverly Russell, who admitted sexually abusing her
as a teenager and gave tearful testimony on her behalf on Thursday,
cried and patted his brow with a white handkerchief after the verdict
was announced.
In his final plea to save Smith's life, Mr Bruck methodically
dismantled the main plank of the prosecution case -- that the murders
resulted from a rational decision to save a love affair.
Her lover had written her that he did not want their relationship to
continue, partly because of her children.
Mr Bruck also sought to prick the conscience of the residents of this
Bible Belt community by reading the jury a passage about casting ''the
first stone'' from the same Bible used to swear them into service.
Under South Carolina law, Smith will not be eligible for parole for 30
years.
Before the jury began its deliberations, Smith's attorney had asked
them to show mercy to the young woman and to consider the broken hearts
of her family while deliberating her fate.
''It's been our responsibility to guide her family through the worst
sort of trouble. Anybody who has been anywhere near this horrible
disaster cannot help but have the overpowering desire to do something --
to do anything -- to lift the terrible burden,'' the attorney said in
his closing argument.
He also asked the panel to remember the evidence of Smith's troubled
emotional life, saying: ''Her judgment is impaired but yours is not.''
The drama burst into the national spotlight last autumn when Smith
maintained for nine days that the children had been abducted by a
''carjacker''.
Authorities mounted a nationwide manhunt, aided by the Smith's
televised pleas for the children's return. Finally, she confessed to
rolling her car into a lake with the boys still strapped inside.
Mr Bruck said Smith committed the murders while gripped by the
overwhelming fear that her incestuous relationship with her stepfather
and another lurid affair were about to be revealed.
Psychiatrists testified that Smith was suicidal and she is likely to
be kept under special observation in prison. -- Reuter.

Tokyo, Friday
FOLLOWING a rejection by Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama,
Second World War prisoners of war were again snubbed today in their
attempt to get an apology for cruelty suffered 50 years ago.
This time, a meeting had been scheduled with Korean guards who had run
Japanese prison camps and, as 73-year-old British PoW Arthur
Titherington put it, ''had handed out some of the roughest treatment
endured by the allies''.
However, none of the guards, some convicted of war crimes, turned up
for the reconciliation opportunity with the PoWs who represent 30,000
fellow prisoners from Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United
States.
Titherington, who gave evidence yesterday in the first court hearing
of the PoWs #440m compensation claim against the Japanese government,
said his group was becoming increasingly frustrated over its treatment
in Japan.
On Tuesday, Murayama refused to meet the PoWs who, as well as a
government apology, want each prisoner to receive #14,600 compensation.
''We have come here to heal old wounds, but the perpetrators of our
suffering are obviously not willing to confess to their crimes. It is a
waste of time and very infuriating,'' Titherington said.
American Melvin Rosen said the snubs by the guards and Murayama
highlighted what he called Japanese tactics of delaying the case.
''We just seem to be taking one step forward, one step back. The court
hearing seemed good progress, but being rejected at the last minute
again knocks our confidence,'' Rosen said.''
* Japan's battered coalition government lurched into a new crisis
today when Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura offered to resign as
leader of the smallest party in the grouping.
The announcement was the final blow on a day when depressing economic
figures cast a growing shadow over Prime Minister Murayama's future.
At a hastily called meeting tonight, Sakigake party officials rejected
Takemura's offer to quit as its leader but kept open the possibility he
would still resign, saying he would delay a final decision until
tomorrow.
Takemura offered to stand down five days after Sakigake and the other
two ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Murayama's
Socialists, were all badly beaten in last Sunday's Upper House
elections.
Sakigake won three seats, half the number it wanted, and the ruling
bloc as a whole ended seven seats short of its target of 75 seats.
The result was seen as a near fatal vote of no confidence in
Murayama's ability to deal with Japan's current challenges -- an economy
battling to pull out of recession and a high yen.--Reuter.

THE Government is pressing ahead with its proposals to reduce state
help with mortgage payments if borrowers lose their jobs or fall ill.
Despite widespread objections and evidence that repossessions are on the
increase again, Peter Lilley, the Social Security Secretary, is
determined to cut back on the #1000m a year it costs to cover mortgage
payments. He wants people to take out private insurance instead.
Under the present arrangements, borrowers who claim income support get
50% of their mortgage interest paid for the first 16 weeks and 100%
thereafter. The changes mean borrowers who take out mortgages after the
beginning of October will have to wait nine months for any state help
with their payments if they become unemployed or fall ill. Those with
existing mortgages will be in a somewhat better position. They will
receive no payment for the first two months, 50% for the next four and
100% thereafter. However, the maximum loan on which interest is paid is
in all cases #100,000.
What many people do not realise is that even under the present rules
it is estimated that more than two-thirds of borrowers do not qualify to
have their mortgage payments met by the state. This is because it is a
means-tested benefit. If you live with someone who is employed and can
pay you will not qualify. If you have savings of over #8000 you are also
ineligible. Having savings of as little as #3000 also affects the amount
you can receive.
To help borrowers avoid problems meeting their payments if hardship
struck, an increasing number of lenders started offering mortgage
payment protection policies. But these were normally only available to
new borrowers or those taking further advances.
Typically, the policies cover your mortgage payments, including
endowment premiums, for up to 12 months if you become involuntarily
unemployed or suffer an accident or illness which prevents you working.
To avoid abuse -- people taking out policies knowing they are about to
be laid off -- you normally have to work for three to six months after
the policy is taken out before cover begins. Thereafter payments
generally start after you have been off work for 30 to 60 days. The cost
of the cover is usually between #6 and #7 for every #100 of mortgage
payment.
The problem in the past was that those who were self-employed, working
part-time or on fixed-term contracts were ineligible. Also certain
medical conditions were not covered, though these exclusions were not
always pointed out to policy holders.
Now it has become clear the Government is not going to change its mind
about cutbacks in state help, lenders and insurers have been looking at
ways of improving cover and making it more widely available. It is
likely existing borrowers could find themselves offered the opportunity
to take out cover between now and October and that eligibility will be
extended.
One of the first societies to act was the Skipton. Its chief
executive, John Goodfellow, took other lenders by surprise by announcing
it would be offering free unemployment cover from October 1 to all its
borrowers irrespective of the nature of their jobs. New borrowers who
wanted wider cover against sickness and accident as well would be able
to obtain it ''at the cheapest rate on the market'', that is #4.50 per
#100 of mortgage payments, and existing borrowers who already had this
cover would have their premiums reduced.
The Skipton, which has 55,000 borrowers, estimates the approximate
cost of the scheme is well over #2m. Larger societies, such as the
Halifax, have said they could not afford a similar free offer.
If you would like cover there are a number of options available. You
should find out whether your present lender offers a policy and whether
it is available to existing borrowers. If there is one, ask for a copy
and for the list of exclusions.
If your lender does not offer one or you would like to investigate the
alternatives, there are now some stand-alone policies available to all
borrowers. General Accident Direct has Protect Direct which is available
to the self-employed and contract workers as well as other employees.
Joint cover is available. Stress-related illnesses and back problems are
covered, though as with all policies pre-existing or chronic conditions
are not.
The National &amp; Provincial Building Society's cover is available to
non-customers and is much more flexible than most other policies. You
can choose either unemployment or accident and sickness cover or a
combination. There is a choice of initial claim exclusion periods (from
one to six months) and of benefit payment periods (nine to 24 months).
Premiums vary -- for example, full cover with a 60-day exclusion and a
benefit payment period of nine months would cost #3.90 per #100 of
mortgage payment.

PRESIDENT Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya runs an unpleasant regime. Many of
the distressing details were given by Sir David Steel in this newspaper
this week, and his conclusion was that the international community needs
to take a much tougher line with Kenya in the future. Thankfully, this
appears to be happening. Baroness Chalker, the Minister of State for
Overseas Development, announced yesterday that British bilateral aid to
Kenya would be frozen until satisfactory progress on human rights, as
well as economic and political reform, was clearly demonstrated.
This approach is long overdue, although Britain also has the credit,
along with other aid donors, of doing precisely the same thing in 1991
in an attempt to press for multi-party elections. One year later the
elections took place, demonstrating the fact that firm pressure in
support of important and achievable aims can succeed.  Baroness Chalker
is rightly concerned at the treatment of opposition parties and the
press in Kenya, and correct to conclude (as she probably has) that
little would improve as long as international aid continues to arrive in
Kenya for the use of the government. Two things flow from this
heartening example of British resolve. It is now obvious that economic
reform, which international institutions and governments have pressed on
African governments in recent years, must be accompanied by improvement
in human rights and by political reform. If this is dubbed ethnocentrism
by the squeamish, so be it.
Less clear is the definition of satisfactory progress in these fields.
Baroness Chalker and the British Government must keep flexibility and
freedom of operation, but it would be helpful for all concerned if the
required improvements could be described clearly. Nor should the #11m of
aid pledged by Britain to Kenya, but not yet released, be handed over. A
good start in helping the people of Kenya has been made; now it must be
followed through.

Nairobi, Friday
BRITAIN said today it was freezing bilateral aid to its former colony
Kenya until it saw satisfactory progress on political and economic
reform and human rights.
Baroness Chalker, Minister of State for Overseas Development, told a
news conference before talks with President Daniel Arap Moi: ''I will
not make any further announcement of aid until I am satisfied not only
by political reform but also economic reform and respect for human
rights.''
After the talks at State House, Chalker emerged to be overheard by
journalists telling Moi: ''I want the president of the World Bank to
come and see you and talk to you so you can see the importance of the
social dimension . . . He's a very nice man.''
''We had fruitful discussions on many matters affecting Kenya,'' Moi
told reporters but added: ''In any discussion (or) business, normally
people will democratically agree to disagree.''
The move by Britain, which long relied on ''quiet diplomacy'' to
foster change in Kenya, shocked bankers. The announcement pushed Britain
to the forefront of donors seeking changes in Kenya. Other countries
have cut their aid this year because of political concerns but none has
frozen it.
Chalker said Britain was concerned at the treatment of opposition
parties and the press and had heard ''very disturbing'' reports of
ethnic tension in the Rift Valley and the evils of corruption.
''All sides, and I do emphasise all sides, have a role to play in
improving the political atmosphere . . . We are looking forward to a
cooling down by the Government of the tension which is very apparent to
all.
''We need also to think of the needs of the people of Kenya. We want
to see a step back from the political brinkmanship and a cooling of
invective,'' the British Minister said.
Britain has already paid #4m of the #15m pledged in December. Asked if
the #11m pledged but not paid would be released, Chalker said she would
wait and see how the situation developed.
Moi this month has attacked foreign donors pressuring his Government
and denounced white conservationist Richard Leakey for aspiring to
leadership by setting up an opposition party.
Some diplomats said they were concerned the 70-year-old President was
warming up for elections due by 1997 and would keep moving hard against
the opposition unless a line was drawn.
Asked how concerned she was by Government moves to block registration
of the Safina party led by Leakey, a Kenyan and personal friend, Chalker
said registration should be open and fair.
''We are very excited by Britain's move,'' said Kiraitu Murungi, a
founder of Safina. ''Britain has at last seen through Moi's
merry-go-round with the donors.''
Britain last froze aid to Kenya in 1991 with other donors to press for
multi-party elections which took place in 1992.--Reuter.

Zenica, Bosnia, Friday
FEARS that there could be a rapid escalation in the Bosnian conflict
have, in a surprising turn of events, shifted from the expansionist
Serbs to an alliance of Croat forces.
Confirming earlier Croat reports, Bosnian Serb sources said today that
Croat troops had taken two key towns, Grahovo and Glamoc, in western
Bosnia, after a four-day offensive.
The Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) said that Croat forces had bombarded
Grahovo and that civilians were evacuated.
UN officials said that some 5000 Serb civilians had fled the town and
were heading northwards along the main road towards Drvar. Some were
driving tractors and trailers, their belongings piled high.
Up to 10,000 Croatian regular and Bosnian Croat militia forces have
poured into the Livno valley, to the southeast of Grahovo.
The most significant Croatian offensive for a year, it is aimed at
cutting Serb-held territory in two and at relieving pressure on
Croatia's allies in the besieged Bosnian government-held enclave of
Bihac, in northwest Bosnia.
Rebel Croation Serbs invaded Bihac 10 days ago to secure supply lines
to Serb-held Bosnia. They also hoped to pre-empt a possible Croatian
government offensive to retake their breakaway territory near the
Adriatic Sea.
The armoured forces, supported by Bosnian Serbs and a rebel Muslim
militia, have swallowed up about one third of the enclave.
More than 8000 Muslim refugees have fled the offensive but are still
caught in the enclave. The UN-designated ''safe area'' of Bihac only
covers Bihac town in the south of the enclave.
UN observers today reported intense Serb shelling around the enclave's
central towns of Pecigrad and Coralici.
UN spokesman Chris Gunness said that the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) warehouse in Bihac town was empty, and that the
situation was desperate. Air strikes to safeguard the town are
problematic, he said.
The UN has promised to strengthen forces on the Croatia-Bosnia border.
But the plan to bolster border forces, announced just two days ago, has
already been met with opposition by both Croat and Serb forces.
A UN spokesman said today: ''The action is being met with some
resistance by both parties, although we haven't had any reports of
physical obstructions.''
He said the problem was a matter of urgency and local commanders were
currently involved in negotiations.
Military activity at the point where Croatian troops have been pouring
over the Bosnian border was quiet tonight. A bus journey across the
Kamensko crossing point was uneventful.
French UN troops, possibly heading towards Bihac or one of the other
protected areas, were camped close to the crossing point.
Armoured vehicles were dotted along road routes but the Croatian and
Serbian fighting units were invisible to passing car and bus passengers.
Fierce fighting may have been taking place to the north but relaxed
border guards and federal police seemed oblivious.
British UN engineers continued to clear the chalky mountain roads and
government army patrols manned roadside lookouts.
A UN spokesman said peacekeeping forces in the border area had not
been involved in any fighting.
''Military activity between warring factions was not near any safe
area so we have not been involved,'' he said.
Bosnian Croat sources later said that 250 Serb soldiers had been
killed in an action which routed 9000 troops of the Second Krajina Corps
of the Bosnian Serb army along a 60-mile front.
About 80 square miles were captured in the action, and a considerable
number of tanks and heavy artillery pieces were seized, Croat military
sources said.

POLICE commandos smashed their way on to a hijacked tourist coach in
Cologne yesterday and opened fire, killing a masked gunman and freeing
20 hostages.
A woman hostage and the driver, who was shot at the start of the
hostage-taking and lay in the front seat throughout the seven-hour
stand-off, were found dead after the storming of the coach. A policeman
was also seriously wounded by the gunman. Authorities said he shot the
woman hostage for no apparent reason shortly before the bus was stormed.
Police special forces, dressed in overalls, flak jackets, and helmets,
rushed up to the coach, smashed the windows with iron bars, and swarmed
aboard as shots rang out.
''The perpetrator was shot dead. In addition to the bus driver we
found one dead hostage,'' a police spokesman said.
The rest of the hostages, who had been on a tour of Rhineland, were
all freed, he added. He could not say if any had been injured.
The gunman's identity and motive remained unclear. Police said he was
Russian-speaking and seemed a well-prepared criminal.
At one stage the man, who had demanded a Russian interpreter, took off
his shirt to display what appeared to be sticks of dynamite strapped to
his chest. Police discovered later they were fake.
A police spokesman said: ''We assume that he would have posed
political demands in the course of the negotiations.'' He would not
elaborate.
Police launched their assault shortly after a hostage, bleeding
heavily, crawled through the coach's smashed rear window and flopped to
the ground.
They lifted the man and loaded him into an armoured car.
The drama began yesterday morning when the bus was about to stop for a
view of the Rhine.
A woman who escaped from the coach said the gunman, who had been a
passenger, began arguing with the driver then took out a gun and shot
him.
''He pulled a mask over his face and threatened the people and was
asking for valuables,'' a witness said.
The gunman then shot and seriously wounded a police officer who
approached the vehicle, parked in Cologne's trade fair grounds.
Police surrounded the bus and sealed off the area with dozens of
police vans and special force vehicles, including armoured cars.
The 34-year-old woman who escaped said the gunman had asked her to
fetch his luggage from the boot of the bus after he shot the driver and
she had used the opportunity to flee.
A male passenger and an 11-year-old boy also escaped by slipping out
the bus's rear window.
The incident was a grim reminder of a similar incident in 1988 in
which bank robbers killed two women hostages they had seized in Gladbeck
after holding them captive during a two-day chase with police.--Reuter

GRANNY celebrates her twentieth birthday this year -- and, no, you
haven't just spotted a printing error. This particular Granny started
life in 1975 as a special index-linked National Savings certificate,
designed to protect elderly savers from the ravages of inflation -- and
her help may be needed again if price rises continue to run ahead of the
Government's target.
Back in 1975 inflation was more than 26% a year. Granny Bonds -- or
Retirement Issue Index-Linked Savings Certificates, to give them their
proper name -- were an immediate hit with savers over retirement age as
a way of protecting nest eggs from the effects of rising prices.
In the first five years some two million savers bought nearly #2000m
worth, attracted by the promise of guaranteed, tax-free growth to help
the value of savings keep pace with rising prices, plus the sweetener of
an extra tax-free bonus, worth 4% of the original investment, payable on
the fifth anniversary. Someone who put in #500 in June 1975, the maximum
then allowed, is now sitting on an investment worth nearly #2870.
In the last 20 years there have been eight issues of Granny Bonds, and
they've been available to savers of any age since 1981. Investors can
now put up to #10,000 of new money in the eighth issue, plus a further
#20,000 reinvested from other National Savings certificates which have
matured.
A switch into the current issue certainly makes sense for those who
have been loyal to Granny since the beginning. Around #400m remains
invested in the first and second issues, and now simply grows in line
with inflation -- there is no extra tax-free bonus on top.
The same goes for investments in the fifth issue. This went on sale in
July 1990 offering 4.5% on top of inflation and was the most popular
index-linked issue ever with nearly #2900m worth sold. Nearly #800m of
those certificates are coming up to maturity in the months ahead, but it
is absolutely vital that holders get to the fifth anniversary and don't
inadvertently cash them in before then.
That is because there is a massive extra tax-free bonus due at the end
of the fifth year -- which is almost the same amount as that paid for
the whole of the previous four years. A #1000 investment made in the
fifth issue on the first day of sale (July 2, 1990) would have been
worth #1237 by the fourth anniversary, for instance, but jumped to #1466
by the fifth.
Holders of the third and fourth issues -- on sale in 1985 and 1986 --
should also consider moving into the current one. They receive just 0.5%
a year extra on top of index-linking against an effective tax-free
yearly bonus of 3% on top of inflation with the eighth issue. Remember
though that, if you reinvest, you will have to wait a further five years
for the full tax-free bonus. The sixth and seventh issues pay an extra
3.25% and 3% respectively on top of inflation, but don't start maturing
until December 1997 and 1998.
So much for the nitty gritty, but, at a time of relatively low
inflation, do index-linked certificates still have a part to play? Well,
although inflation now may be nothing like the levels of 1975, there are
real concerns that price pressures are building up again. June's
inflation rate was the highest for 18 months and the sixth consecutive
time that price rises have been outside the Government's target to bring
underlying inflation -- excluding tax and housing costs -- below 2.5%.
The main inflation figure shows that prices are now 3.4% higher than a
year ago, nearly three times the low point reached in June 1993 when the
rate of increase slumped to just 1.2%. Higher manufacturing costs are
feeding through to shop prices, signalling an easing of last year's
savage supermarket price wars. Economists had expected further interest
rate rises to keep prices down and now fear the Government may be
relaxing its grip on inflation.
For higher rate taxpayers the argument in favour of index-linked
certificates is overwhelming. If inflation does stay at around 3.5% for
the next five years, that means a total tax-free return of 6.5% a year
-- and to achieve that sort of income after tax higher rate payers would
need a gross return of nearly 11%.
Basic rate taxpayers have to think harder about the potential rewards.
If inflation does take off again, say to around 4% or higher,
index-linked certificates make sense. But at lower rates an overall
return of around 6% can be bettered.
Tax exempt special savings accounts -- or Tessas -- from banks and
building societies could be worth a look. National &amp; Provincial's
fixed-rate Tessa pays a tax-free 7%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland's
pays a variable 6.5% plus a bonus equal to 5% of interest paid over the
five years.
Conventional Government gilt-edged stocks held for five years are
yielding more than 8% before tax, while the index-linked variety are an
excellent long-term choice too, especially now it has confirmed that
private investors holding under #200,000 of gilts will continue to be
exempt from capital gains tax.
But the main selling point of index-linked certificates must remain
their cast-iron guarantee of tax-free, inflation proofed growth which,
for millions of savers living in an uncertain financial world, still
counts for an awful lot.

A DRUNKEN vet who attacked a policeman outside a public house and
bungled an operation on a dog was struck off yesterday.
William Kerr McNeil, who practised in Aberdour, Fife, was found guilty
of five charges of disgraceful conduct and one charge of being unfit to
practise by a disciplinary board at the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons in London.
McNeil, 42, faced charges including kicking a policeman in the knee
after an incident in a bar in Burntisland, Fife, on September 18. He had
already been found guilty in court of assaulting the officer and was
fined #250.
The hearing was also told McNeil had made a mess of stitches following
an operation on a lump in a dog's stomach in August 1994, which led to a
''high risk of post-operational bleeding''.
Mr McNeil, of Livingstone Lane, Aberdour, was also found guilty of
disgraceful conduct following an incident in March this year when he
telephoned Ms Anita Smyth, of Aberdour, to tell her that her kitten
Ronald, suffering only from diarrhea, should be put down.
Other visitors to his surgery lodged complaints after they found him
''drunk on duty''.
Ms Catherine Tweed, of McGregor Road, Rosyth, said that when she
arrived at the surgery on March 10 she was ''totally shocked because it
was very dirty looking''. She saw Mr McNeil leaning on a wooden table.
''He was propping himelf up on it.''
After explaining what was wrong with her rabbit, she watched
dumbstruck as the vet struggled to take him out of the box.
''Eventually he did but he was swaying and was obviously very drunk.
The smell of alcohol was so strong. . . as soon as you opened the door
the smell really hit you.''
Mr McNeil told her the rabbit had an infection and needed an
injection. ''He was grappling with the injection, trying to fill the
syringe up, then basically he injected the rabbit in his neck. We just
froze.''
Ms Tweed asked Mr McNeil what his fee was and he just waved his hand
and ushered her from the surgery.
The next morning, her rabbit was found dead but she explained that a
post-mortem examination revealed he had cancer and would have died even
if she had taken him to another vet.
When two other vets, Mr Walter Beswick and Professor Hugh Pirie,
visited Mr McNeil's practice, they found he was so drunk that he was
''unfit to undertake veterinary practice''.
Mr Beswick said: ''If anyone had come to that door with an animal at
that time when we were with him, I would have been very embarrassed. In
the condition that he was in when I saw him, I would not have been happy
to have any animal in his care.''
Mr McNeil admitted drinking to ''steady his nerves''.
However, Mr Beswick did later speak to the board on Mr McNeil's
behalf.
He said: ''All of the problems here arose through his drink problem.
Now that he recognises that he has a problem, I think the committee
should help him.''
Mr McNeil told the hearing: ''I realise this is my last chance and I
am prepared to do or undertake any suggestion. I will do whatever it
takes to sort things out and put things back on an even keel again.''
Striking Mr McNeil off the RCVS register, disciplinary hearing
chairman Peter Hignett said: ''The committee has taken careful note of
the matters raised in mitigation, the letters of support, and the offers
of help.
''Nevertheless, the offences are such that, mindful of our
responsibility for animals and the public, we have decided that the
registrar be directed to remove your name from the register.
''It is the committee's hope that you will now take this opportunity
to overcome your problems so that in due course you will be able to
rejoin the profession.''

ONCE more we are being reminded of what an extraordinary nation we
are. After many years of agonising, we at last have a National Lottery.
It has proved to be instantly popular, and many more people than
expected are queueing to buy tickets. Many more people are winning
prizes, and they are getting bigger prizes than they originally hoped
for.
As if all this was not enough, there is a well-publicised scheme for
benefiting good causes out of the proceeds. They in turn are being given
donations for their work which are mostly much larger than they had ever
dreamed of receiving in the past.
Altogether an enormous success you might think. But alas, you would be
wrong. The only thing we seem to hear about all this is a cacophony of
complaints. Every time some worthy cause gets a grant, 10 others
complain that they have not received a grant even if they are still in
the running and waiting to hear in their turn.
We really must do better than this, or people will rightly think the
British have lost their marbles.
Let us remind ourselves of what the aim of the National Lottery is,
and of some of the facts, if it is not ''politically incorrect'' to do
so.
The objective is to allow people, if they wish, to enjoy the
excitement of a harmless game of chance, and to put the majority of the
proceeds to a multitude of good causes which would otherwise be unlikely
to get funds from another source.
It is clearly achieving these objectives very well indeed.
It might help at this point to dispel a myth. The people who buy a
lottery ticket do not do so to give to charity. They do it in the hope
of winning a big prize. There is nothing wrong with that of course, but
if they want to give #1 to cancer research they can do so at any time.
Moreover, they can do so in the sure knowledge that all of it will be
used for precisely that purpose.
It is therefore nonsense to suggest that we should be able to specify
to which cause a proportion of our #1 ticket should go.
It is also said that no grant should be given to an activity that is
enjoyed by people who are well-off. The classic example used is that of
the large grant being given to help the rebuilding of Covent Garden; but
there are many other such cases that will no doubt be brought up.
There are two answers to this. The first is that if it were so, we
should surely not give to many charities which may be of benefit to the
rich. Medical research, for instance, is just as valuable to the rich as
it is the poor, yet it would be quite unacceptable to argue that no
money should be granted for the lottery to medical research in case some
rich people benefited from it.
Another argument has even suggested that only the well-off go to
opera, ballet, or classical music. This is patronising nonsense and
quite untrue.
I have also recently heard that we should not aid great art (Picasso
paintings were mentioned) as it is not for ''ordinary'' people. Again,
what insulting rubbish this is.
It is a major national interest of us all that our main artistic
institutions should be up to the highest international standards, and
should be available to as many people as possible. The same points can
be made about grants to sport.
Distribution of lottery money cannot be immediately perfect, and
mistakes will be made. The system is wide, however, and will cover all
tastes. There are five categories for aid; charities, arts, sport,
heritage, and the millennium (celebrating the year 2000).
The grants will be both large and small, and most of them will provide
money that would never have been available without the National Lottery.
Criticism is part of life, but critics are not themselves immune from
being taken to task if their criticisms are ill-founded. I hope they
will now recognise that the National Lottery is a great success, and
will give it a chance to settle down.
Thereafter, all of us can enjoy the fruits of the extra help it will
give to many good causes. Perhaps we will then have found one success
that even the British cannot turn into a disaster.

OWEN Scott, human resources director at the Edinburgh-based WM
Company, has just cycled 500 miles from St Petersburg to Moscow on
behalf of the Friends of Russian Children. The charity raises funds for
a Russian children's hospital opened as a result of a disaster in which
hundreds of youngsters were seriously burned.
Altogether the 65 cyclists taking part have raised almost #90,000.
Having promised to gather #2500 himself, Scott's final total is nearly
#4000 -- partly due to a donation from the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, which provides accountancy training in Russia
and has close links with the country.
Scott comments: ''This is the first time I've taken part in something
like this. I've always been interested in Russia and this is a very good
way to see the country at first hand and get fit at the same time. But
the main motivation is the children -- witnessing the harrowing
conditions at the hospital made those long hours in the saddle
worthwhile.''
The participants ranged from 18 to 60 years old, and despite the fact
that most were not regular cyclists, all completed the ride. However,
Scott reveals: ''We were almost walking to Moscow when our bikes were
removed from the plane at Heathrow to make way for a consignment of
flowers.''
Chance to win a Royal souvenir
A FEW weeks ago I told Business Diary readers about a new booklet
published by the Royal Bank of Scotland to mark the 250th anniversary of
Bonnie Prince Charlie's abortive Jacobite rebellion in 1745.
Alwyn James, head of the bank's internal communications department,
was so taken by my description of the booklet, ''The diary of John
Campbell'', that he has kindly donated 50 free copies for Herald readers
who can answer the following simple question correctly: what is the
surprising connection between the Church of Scotland hymn ''Thine Be The
Glory'' and the defeat of the Jacobites at Culloden?
I can only say that those who do a bit of research and find the
solution might not sing it quite so lustily having discovered the
reasons for its writing.
The booklet sets down the diary jottings of John Campbell, who was the
Royal Bank's chief cashier at the time of the '45 rebellion, and
recounts how he went to Edinburgh Castle to retrieve gold coin after it
was demanded by Bonnie Prince Charlie's Highlanders.
There is a suggestion in the book that Campbell was a closet Jacobite
-- the front cover shows him wearing a kilt following the defeat of the
Jacobite army at Culloden. The portrait was painted at a time when the
kilt was banned and, therefore, suggests that there was a bit of the
rebel in him.
Readers should send their answers to Diary Competition, Business Desk,
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. The booklets will go to
the senders of the first 50 correct answers.
Powerful claim
about meanness
STUNG by Manweb's accusation that its #1000m takeover bid was
''mean'', ScottishPower is at pains to point out its generosity -- to
fellow Scots at least, if not to undeserving Sassenachs.
Chairman Murray Stuart told ScottishPower's AGM in Glasgow this week
that the company donated #675,000 to local charities and community
organisations during the 1994/95 financial year. The money came from
interest earned on the #36m which canny customers paid in advance to
escape VAT before it was slapped on electricity in early 1994.
Manweb, as ScottishPower officials gleefully point out, made no
attempt to give away its own windfall earnings from similar advance
payments. A spokeswoman for the Chester-based power company says it
earned #1.2m in interest on #37m of VAT-beater advance payments. This
was used to cover the cost of adding VAT to power bills and to reduce
Manweb's costs in other areas.
Leather company
drives a bargain
BUSINESS Diary just can't get away from historical connections today
as this year marks the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance between
the French and Scottish monarchs.
Links between the two countries were strengthened yesterday when
Renault UK announced a major contract with Bridge of Weir Leather. The
family-owned Renfrewshire company has been around since the turn of the
century and has had links with the car industry since the twenties, when
it supplied leather for the Model T Ford.
The company's latest contract, worth a cool #3m over the next 12
months, is to supply leather upholstery for 15,300 of Renault's Laguna
Safran cars. Among those who attended the celebrations was French
actress Fabienne Dellizotti, the mysterious star of the Laguna
television advert, who is certainly not history.
Renault will be taking part in the Scottish round of the British
Touring Car Championship at Knockhill tomorrow in a pair of racing
Lagunas.
Let's not have a
birthday drink
NEXT week RW Kinnaird will celebrate its 25th anniversary. It claims
to be Scotland's longest serving PR and marketing consultancy, but
Business Diary would not want to state this as a fact for fear of
upsetting other PRs.
However, Bob Kinnaird, the firm's teetotal managing director, says
there will be little opportunity for the customary glass of champagne as
the timing coincides with the launch of a major five-year study to
measure the effectiveness of PR in advertising.
It appears little has changed in the quarter century since Kinnaird
opened for business in a small two-roomed office above the noise of
printing presses in the Glasgow Herald building in Buchanan Street, as
no-one we have spoken to can recall any champagne being opened to mark
the launch.
Legging it for a
very good cause
KEEP an eye out today for Kenneth Archibald and Robert Brown who are
walking from Paisley to Edinburgh to raise money for Headway and the
Head Injuries Trust for Scotland. Don't think they are just a couple of
yuppies out for a stroll -- the mobile phones they are carrying have
been supplied by DX Communications.
DX has written to companies with offices or shops along the route
informing them of the event and asking for their support. As Archibald
and Brown pass they will call them and hopefully arrange to collect a
cheque.
The pair started their walk at 5am yesterday and their final
destination is Murrayfield Stadium, where two of the Claymores will be
on hand to meet them.
Best of luck lads, hope you've time to read The Herald on your way.
Help ma kilt, here
comes Batwoman
REMAINING in a historical vein, some people might argue the kilt
should be banned once more if they had visited the offices of Harper
Macleod recently, when three of the commercial law firm's partners and
one trainee came to work wearing the kilt to raise funds for the Hayley
Myles Walking Frame Appeal.
The firm's kindhearted staff each made a minimum pledge of #1 to join
in a recent ''dressing down day''. Part of the fundraising event
involved voting on who they would most like to see dressed as Batman or
Batwoman. Associate Pamela Smith gained most votes.
Hayley Myles, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is the daughter of
Caroline Myles, one of Harper Macleod's para-legals. The walking frame
appeal finished last night with a disco and hopes to have raised around
#3000, which will cover the #1600 to fit the frame together with its
maintenance.

<TEXT>
THE Metropolitan Police Commissioner has defended his initiative on
street crime after it caused outrage among the black community.
Earlier this month, Sir Paul Condon suggested most muggings in London
were carried out by black youths.
A meeting at New Scotland Yard yesterday prompted a noisy
demonstration outside the building by people commemorating the second
anniversary of the death of illegal immigrant Joy Gardner and by those
upset at Sir Paul's remarks.
Afterwards, Sir Paul said he felt it had been necessary to explain in
advance to black communities that his street crime initiative, due to go
into operation next week, was likely to target black youths.
He told a news conference that there had been an alarming increase in
muggings, doubling in the last 10 years, and were heading for a total of
40,000 this year.
Research had shown a large proportion of these offences in London were
carried out by black youngsters, Sir Paul said. ''Victims tell us that
in a significant proportion of robberies in London the people who are
committing them happen to be black. It is not their blackness that has
made them commit crime but we cannot ignore the fact that many of the
youngsters we are going to be arresting are going to be black.''
He said information from 20 police stations in the capital which had a
significant problem with street robbery suggested 60-90% of those
committing the muggings were black, and the average for London as a
whole was around 70%.
The demonstrators outside New Scotland Yard included both black and
white protesters. Among them was Joy Gardner's mother, Myrna Simpson,
who said she felt terrible about the meeting taking place.
Labour MP Bernie Grant, who declined an invitation to attend the
meeting, called on Sir Paul to publish the statistics on which he based
his remarks. The Tottenham MP warned of potential problems with the
initiative on muggings, saying: ''If police officers target young black
people who are innocent, I think you are going to have a very explosive
situation.''
Prominent among the protesters was Mr Peter Herbert, chairman of the
Society of Black Lawyers, who complained that offences such as armed
robbery in London were perpetrated predominantly by white males but Sir
Paul had not called for a meeting with Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of
the Commons Home Affairs Select committee, to ask him to ''get his
community in order''.
Sir Paul made his claims about black youths in a letter inviting
around 40 people to the meeting. He wrote: ''It is a fact that very many
of the perpetrators of mugging are very young black people who have been
excluded from school and/or are unemployed.''
Sir Paul said he had been anxious not to launch a major operation,
knowing significant numbers of black youths may be arrested, without
first explaining why it was necessary.
''We will do it as sensitively and sensibly as possible but I do not
have the luxury of ignoring the problem,'' Sir Paul said.
The objective of the street crime initiative, codenamed Eagle Eye, was
to isolate, deter, and catch the small number of people responsible.
Sir Paul said he did not regret sending his letter and denied
intending any kind of racial slur. He did not see those who would be
targeted in terms of their colour but in terms of their criminality.
''We are not interested in their colour, we are interested in the fact
that they are street robbers.''

FOR 23 long years a woman has lain in an Irish hospital, rendered near
dead after a minor operation that went wrong, and kept alive by a
life-support tube dripping food and liquids into her stomach. She has
the tragic notoriety of being Europe's longest surviving coma patient,
suspended in a near vegetative state unable to move, feed or
communicate.
Now, after a historic and controversial ruling in the Republic's
highest court she is to be allowed to die. The decision is the end of a
difficult road for her family who appealed to the courts after watching
whatever signs of recovery the woman had shown in the first few years
fade over the decades.
Beneath the complicated ethical, legal and medical issues there lies a
tangle of highly emotive and moral ones. In a country whose five Supreme
Court judges had no precedent within their own jurisdiction to fall back
on, it was inevitable that parallels would be drawn with the English
High Court ruling three years ago to allow the Hillsborough victim Tony
Bland, deemed to be in a permanent vegetative state, to die. Debate on
Ireland's first ''right to die case'' has been equally high-pitched.
And, while the Supreme Court was at pains to stress that the ruling
related solely to the case before it, the detailed judgment could have
implications for around 18 other people lying in a vegetative state in
Irish hospitals as well, strengthening the case for those who would like
parliament to consider a change in the law.
Behind this week's ruling is a story of a woman loyally visited by her
Roman Catholic relatives since her disastrous operation in 1972. The
woman, whose name has been kept private, suffered three heart seizures
during a gynaecological operation under a general anaesthetic when she
was 22. The higher part of her brain, the cortex, was virtually
destroyed after being deprived of oxygen. The brain's stem --
controlling temperature, heartbeat, digestion and breathing -- remained
unaffected.
The consequences were catastrophic. While her lungs and digestive
system function almost normally she is bedridden, paralysed with her
arms and legs extended. She cannot swallow and her teeth are clenched
together.
However, unlike Tony Bland, whose condition was described as
persistent vegetative, the woman has shown some signs of recognition
towards long-time nursing staff and shown signs of distress if strangers
have come into her field of vision.
Finally, though, in May her family sought a High Court ruling to
remove the woman's feeding tube. The court assented but its decision was
challenged by the Attorney General and by the hospital caring for the
woman.
However, the Supreme Court upheld the original ruling, concluding in a
158-page judgment that the treatment was invasive, that the true cause
of the woman's death was her original injuries, not the withdrawal of
food, and that the benefits of sustaining a life in such circumstances
were far outweighed by the burdens of sustaining a life where there was
no prospect of improvement.
Only one of the judges dissented, describing the action of removing
the feeding tube as tantamount to killing a human being.
The ruling prompted a bitter response from Ireland's well-organised
pro-life lobby which has campaigned vociferously since the 1970s on a
whole range of emotive issues including euthanasia, contraception and
abortion.
At the far end of the spectrum the court was accused of outstripping
the Nazis while others saw the judgment as the state sanctioning
euthanasia. The Dublin-based Pro-Life Campaign, for instance, declared
that the Supreme Court had allowed itself to fall into the trap of using
quality of life criteria as the basis of a judgment that ''a gravely
impaired life is without purpose or meaning and so not worth living''.
Feeding, it argued, is not a treatment. ''The medical and nursing
professions are thereby drawn into putting into effect the idea that
some people are better off dead. Such a philosophy is profoundly
anti-life and corrupts the whole concept of palliative care.''
The Catholic Church, while reiterating its teaching that medical
treatment could be withheld if it could not achieve its ''distinctive
purposes'', heard the Archbishop of Dublin add that it could never be
morally acceptable to withdraw tube-feeding precisely to end a person's
life. Yesterday the Church also referred to the Tony Bland judgment as
one which seriously eroded the legal protection offered to those in the
care of doctors.
The ruling has split the medical profession after being welcomed by
some doctors, condemned by the Nurses for Life organisation,
contradicting the Irish Nurses Organisation's code of ethics and leaving
the Medical Council floundering with the admission it has no guidelines.
It has, however, not come as a real surprise to Irish commentators
given the tendency of the courts to protect the concept of individual
rights enshrined in the Irish constitution.
In its editorial, the Irish Times argued that few fair minded people
could disagree with the opinion of Ireland's Chief Justice, Liam
Hamilton, who said that the woman was terminally ill and being
artificially kept alive. ''Given the agony and suffering endured by the
woman and her family this was a compassionate and sensitive finding.''
Tom Cooney, law lecturer at University College Dublin and a member of
the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, argues that the court ruling
could have a general application and strenghten calls for a change in
the law.
''Already the Irish parliament has before it a Bill on the power of
attorney in the event of injuries leaving an individual incapable of
making their own decisions. There will be calls now for legislation to
protect an individual's right to die without unwanted medical treatment
in the form of a living will.''
But what the Tony Bland case has illustrated is that parliaments are
likely to drag their heels over making any sweeping changes in the law.
This week, for example, an English couple are preparing their High Court
case appealing for their 22-month-old brain damaged son to die. They
believe they have been ensnared in a grey area of the law which fails to
recognise that artificial feeding is as much a life support as a
ventilator.
The Irish Supreme Court ruling is unlikely to usher in
state-sanctioned euthanasia along the lines of that practised in the
Netherlands.

THE whoops and gasps emanating briefly from a room on the 20th floor
of Barings London headquarters last Sunday evening came from a group of
weary men clustered around the only available television set.
They were watching Constantino Rocca's fluffed chip into the Valley of
Sin at St Andrews' eighteenth hole, and the roars as the 37-year-old
Italian's huge follow-up putt sank and the 124th Open Championship went
to a play-off.
The television watchers did not have time to witness the four extra
holes which saw John Daly, not Rocca, eventually snatch the claret jug.
They had other pressing work to do. The rest of the evening was devoted
to putting the finishing touches to a hush-hush project which had been
consuming all their waking hours for more than two weeks.
Next morning the rest of us were let in on the secret. An audacious
ScottishPower revealed to the Stock Exchange that it was bidding some
#1000m to take control of Manweb, one of the English regional
electricity supply companies, covering 1,300,000 customers in the
Liverpool area, Chester, and North Wales.
The bid, the first from within the sector since it was privatised at
the end of the eighties, was a complete surprise to Manweb's board. But
it was an equal shock to a City which has been speculating for months on
who would feature in the expected round-two reorganisation of the
industry.
It's not often that such charges are led from north of the Border,
south. The boot has usually been on the other foot. Hence the surprise.
At this stage Manweb's directors are pledged to resist what the southern
media has gleefully and stereotypically seized on as a ''mean'' Scottish
offer.
But ScottishPower has already built up a substantial Manweb stake by
buying in the market and must be confident, barring an intervention by
the Monopolies Commission, of eventually winning its battle.
Among the group watching Rocca's roller-coaster fortunes last Sunday
was SP's new chief executive Ian Robinson, whose main passion apart from
work and family, is banging the wee white ball himself.
A 17 handicapper, Robinson would have been at the Old Course if he and
his colleagues hadn't had bigger fish to fry in London. In the weeks
ahead, until the outcome of the Manweb bid is decided, 52-year-old
Robinson will have little time to test out his own game at his new club,
Bearsden.
But who is this white-haired, soft-spoken professional engineer who,
less than five months since he first sat down at his Atlantic Quay desk
in Glasgow, is taking a canny Scottish utility with a languishing share
price into the heated arena of a hostile take-over bid, one which
already has the industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild,
flapping uneasily in his eyrie?
When the fruits of the headhunters' long trawl for a successor to Dr
Ian Preston at ScottishPower were first announced last December, there
were plenty of pillars in the Scottish business establishment asking
''Ian who?'' of Preston's successor over the hors d'oeuvre or the
post-prandial dram.
They had, perhaps, assumed that such a plum job in a major Scottish
company would be filled from within their own ranks.
Ian Robinson, son of a railway clerk turned station master, who spent
his first 21 years living within a few paces of railway platforms around
the north of England from Hull to near Newcastle, has a Scots-born wife.
But his own roots lie the other side of Hadrian's Wall.
With Robinson following two long-term expatriate Scots -- chairman
Murray Stuart and, last year, finance director Ian Russell -- into the
key roles at ScottishPower, it has been getting harder for the more
incestuously cozy corners of Scottish commerce to keep tabs on the
changing faces at the top of the bigger of Scotland's two power
utilities.
But Robinson, with a disarming northern directness, has been telling
anyone who bothered to listen what he is about, almost from day one.
Within two weeks of his arrival in March, he told a small Scottish media
dinner that ScottishPower was now actively pursuing expansion
opportunities overseas, or in the utility sector south of the Border.
''That's the business we understand,'' he said. ''We are opportunity
rich,'' said Russell, to underline the point.
It was known that, pre-Robinson, ScottishPower had looked at playing a
white knight role in saving another regional English power company,
Northern, from the clutches of Trafalgar House (ironically Robinson's
then employer), but had baulked at joining an auction. By late May it
was public knowledge that it was bidding to buy United Energy, a power
distribution business being privatised by the Victorian State Government
in Australia.
At the start of this month, Robinson flew there himself to assess that
option. But, all along, ScottishPower's board was also exploring a range
of other options, including a share buy-back and other takeover targets
nearer home, among the English supply companies.
Manweb emerged as the prime target, not just because it is digestible
but also because, on most of the main performance measures, it offers
the largest scope for improving efficiency and adding value for
shareholders.
But why take over anything? By bench marking against some of the
world's best, ScottishPower has already turned itself into the lowest
cost electricity distribution company in the UK. It has a profitable
retail business which, thanks in part to the purchase of elements of the
failed Clydesdale empire and five other superstores from -- ironically
-- Manweb, now has 47 out of 157 outlets in England.
Its gas business supplies some 6000 sites across the UK. It launched a
new telecoms business last year. Why, with all that activity, climb into
the bidding ring?
Robinson denies that it has anything to do with being predator, lest
you turn into prey. ''We have a healthy business,'' he insists. ''But we
know that if we want to create step change in this company, we can only
do it through acquisition. But we will only contemplate acquisition if
we know it can create shareholder value.''
Much of Robinson's career has been about building things -- major
engineering projects in the first two decades, businesses in the past 10
years. ''I've always got a thrill out of tangible achievement,'' he
says. As a child he was inevitably in awe of the steam engines which
thundered along the track outside his front door. As a schoolboy in
Middlesbrough, maths and the sciences were where he excelled.
''I always wanted to be an engineer and, because I was reasonably
outstanding at chemistry, I decided to be a chemical engineer.'' After
school, Robinson went to Leeds to pursue that ambition and worked in
ICI's Wilton complex during his holidays.
Why a local university? Why not London, say, another centre of
chemical engineering excellence? ''I could have gone to London,''
Robinson concedes, ''but I just didn't feel comfortable with that
prospect. I think, at the end of the day, it was about the people. I
felt I would be a good fit at Leeds.''
Readers who think they detect a whiff of parochial caution in that
answer should think again. Robinson's career since has crisscrossed the
globe, from California to the Middle East, from Australia to Spain.
In the third year of his studies he won a scholarship from Selection
Trust which took him to Northern Rhodesia's copper mines for three
months.
''It was the first time I'd ever flown and the journey took three
days, because an engine failed on the way and spares had to be flown
out. I thought flying was wonderful.'' He and three colleagues took some
time off in the middle of the assignment, bought a car for #50, and
toured central Africa.
On his return, Robinson's professor urged him to do a PhD. But he had
his mind set on an industrial career, with ICI and Teesside as the prime
target. Having lost a promising doctoral student, his professor urged
him to join M W Kellogg, the leading American firm of consulting
engineers and contractors.
Within nine months, Robinson was off to Spain to help commission an
oil refinery. Other overseas assignments followed including nine months
in Melbourne, and a year at Kellogg's parent office in the US.
He met his wife-to-be during this time and, shortly after their
marriage, he was posted to Belgium where, for months, he was
consistently working 12-hour nights commissioning a chemical plant.
''That certainly tested our relationship,'' he adds.
After eight years with Kellogg he was lured away by the promise of
more money by another leading American engineering consultancy, Los
Angeles-based Ralph M Parsons. Working in their London office gave him a
first taste of Scotland, working on projects like the British Aluminium
smelter at Fort William, and the St Fergus oil and gas terminal.
By the age of 41, with a daughter and son added to the family, he was
managing director of Parsons' London operation, which employed 1200
people. The next move was to California, the only non-US citizens among
15 senior executives at Parsons corporate HQ.
Those were the days of building really big things, like the $10bn
industrial city of Yanbu, constructed on Saudi Arabia's western
seaboard, a massive 10-year project masterminded by Parsons. Robinson
lived in Saudi for six months.
He could, he readily admits, have succumbed to the Californian
lifestyle. But at the time, in the mid-eighties, when his children were
12 and eight, the Robinsons decided to return to England and ensure an
English education for their family. There was, he agrees, something
suspect about a culture where some 17-year-olds drive around in soft-top
BMWs.
Within nine months of coming back, Robinson was headhunted by John
Brown, to run its 1000-strong engineering office in London. At that
stage, in 1986, the business-building phase of Robinson's career began.
By 1990 he was in overall charge of John Brown's international
engineering construction business, responsible for some 8000 people in
50 countries.
In March 1992 he joined the parent Trafalgar House board. But, within
six months, the old guard at Trafalgar -- Nigel Broackes and Eric Parker
-- had gone and control was rapidly moving into the hands of Hong
Kong-based Jardine Mathieson. Robinson became chairman and managing
director of the entire engineering division of Trafalgar, an empire
embracing John Brown (including the Clydebank-based turbine business);
Davy; and the offshore business (including the Methil fabrication yard).
They were, Robinson admits, difficult times. ''You never really knew
what other people were thinking. All I could do was get on with running
the businesses I was responsible for.''
It is, he adds, a time that calls for strong leadership. ''You don't
want people standing around in corridors, speculating. You want them to
trust you to tell them what's happening, when it's appropriate to tell
them.''
When the headhunters returned, in the summer of last year, with the
prospect of the top job at ScottishPower, Robinson was, initially, cool
about the move. But gradually he changed his mind. He knew by then that,
with Jardine looking to its own, he was not going to be the next chief
executive of Trafalgar House.
Three things excited him about the alternative posting in Glasgow.
First, the work that had already been done and the momentum which had
been built up to turn ScottishPower into a quality company. Secondly, he
liked the executive team he met, and the employees who seemed committed
to the change process. And, thirdly, there were those opportunities to
grow.
''It felt a good fit,'' says Robinson, echoing that choice of Leeds as
his university. His challenge now is to persuade the regulatory
authorities and Manweb's shareholders that Chester and Liverpool are
part of that fit too.

BEMUSED passers-by were forced to take a second look at this
sixties-style ''bed-in'' staged at an Edinburgh gallery yesterday,
writes BILL MAGEE. Lying arm-in-arm and often writhing on a mattress in
a shop window in Cockburn Street, city Art College post-graduates
Katrina Moorhead and Robert Montgomery recreated roles made famous by
John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The venue, the Collective Gallery, was
responsible for an exhibition of thousands of sanitary towels three
years ago. The couple's antics caught the eye of many pedestrians. Mrs
Charlotte James, aged 66, of Drumview Avenue, Danderhall, Midlothian,
walked past the window with her daughter Julie. ''I thought it was a
live sex show. It did make you look twice.'' Mr Montgomery stressed that
he and his partner were ''clean-cut kids'' with the predominant
whiteness of the bed-in used to heighten its visual aspect. Gallery
assistant Frances Anderson said the colour chosen represented peace. The
couple, both in their early twenties, have been asked to recreate the
bed-in at Berlin's Goldsworthy Gallery. This latest arts controversy
comes hard on the heels of Edinburgh's Lord Provost Norman Irons being
urged to step in and help ban a planned Festival photographic exhibition
featuring parts of mutilated bodies.

THE outcome of the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election has, like
Perth &amp; Kinross before it, confirmed the in-built advantage which the
second placed party enjoys when tackling the Tories mid-term.
If you are well established locally then it takes a mighty amount of
political persuasion to wean those unhappy with the Government away from
the most obvious remedy: voting for the perceived main challenger.
Thus, the SNP took Perth &amp; Kinross; similarly, now, the Liberal
Democrats have dispatched the Government in Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth.
But, in truth, this latest by-election conveys much more than a mere
confirmation of Tory unpopularity -- despite the apparent fillip of
their leadership election. It poses some profound questions for the
Labour Party as well.
Consider the following, billed in a lengthy and detailed piece of
campaign literature, as a ''nightmare''. In it the accusers point the
finger at the accused, the charge sheet including proposals to:
* Spend more on education through possible tax increases;
* Establish a review body to investigate immigrants' complaints;
* Set up an office of Prison Ombudsman;
* Create an Animal Protection Commission.
The above, and I could cite no fewer than 16 more from this charge
sheet alone -- were not old Tory attacks upon Labour. They were ''new''
Labour attacks upon the Liberal Democrats. Even more remarkable, these
were not the rushed, reactionary condemnations from an inexperienced
candidate and an overheated local campaign team.
They were in fact the considered judgments issued on behalf of the
Labour leadership by one of their Front Bench Treasury spokesmen, Andrew
Smith MP. The senior Labour politician who put his and his party's name
to that set of appalling prejudices is in line to have significant
control of the purse strings of the land, come a Labour Government.
Or again, consider the vexed issue of drug abuse -- a curse which
haunts too many homes and communities across the land, leaving not one
family unconcerned about its growing incidence and deepening
implications. At last year's Liberal Democrat conference a motion was
passed -- admittedly against the wishes of the leadership -- calling for
the setting up of a Royal Commission into the issue. Specifically, that
motion called for any such Commission to consider as part of its work
the matter of the decriminalisation of so-called soft drugs.
The new Liberal Democrat MP for Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth expressed
his general support for that motion. So would the likes of the retiring
Chief Constable of Scotland's biggest police force, Leslie Sharp of
Strathclyde -- who, after all, has had to confront the problem on a
daily basis in the course of his law and order duties.
Even the present Government, in a recent legal reform which received
insufficient public attention, has moved to enable spot fines to be
issued in Scotland for possession of soft drugs. By making the matter a
civil offence, placing it on the same basis as a parking fine, you are
taking a conscious step down the decrimininalisation path. Secretary of
State Forsyth has expressed no intention of reversing his own party's
policy at Scottish Office level in this respect.
But Tony Blair's Labour Party no longer, it appears, sees the world --
and the social problems which confront us -- in quite such considered,
rational terms. Instead they resort to American-style moral majority
techniques.
I have to hand another of their more infamous leaflets from this
contest, ''By-election latest: Lib-Dems drop candidate after drugs
vote''. Does this refer to anything or anyone associated with the
localities in which it was distributed? Of course not. In fact it
involved a candidate selection process in far-off Winchester.
One should not be too precious about this sort of thing. By-election
hand-to-hand electoral combat can throw up trenchant exchanges and
tricky campaign behaviour. In days gone by I have experienced the
occasional sharp intake of breath where some of my own side's literature
has been involved, no denying that.
But what amazes me and dismays me in near equal measure about the
focus of Labour's anti-Lib Dem attacks recently have been the chosen
targets, by which I do not mean our party or even our party candidate,
both -- self-evidently -- more than capable of looking after themselves.
No, what beggars belief is the willingness of Tony Blair's Labour
Party -- here in the trusted hands of his close political confidant and
spin doctor, Peter Mandelson MP -- to select precisely the kind of
issues, affecting exactly the kinds of groups of individuals, which can
stir reactionary sentiment about people and problems which do not and
will never lend themselves to such simplistic, crude political
sloganeering.
Labour Party members and activists, Labour inclining voters, might
like to ask themselves the following kinds of questions as they reflect
upon that party's performance in this by-election.
* Do they consider the cause of a fairly based and justly administered
immigration policy to be helped or hindered by its being lambasted in
Labour literature as representing a bureaucratic ''nightmare''?
* Are they persuaded that the vital argument to win public support for
greater investment in our state education system has been advanced by
Labour leaflets caricaturing such a proposal by means of a cartoon
burglar, complete with swag bag marked ''Tax Snatch'', and commenting
''Hefty Tax Increases . . . A Price Worth Paying!''?
I suspect that the response from the vast majority of Labour members
and supporters across Scotland will be one of disgust at this
intelligence-insulting, issue-demeaning approach. Equally, there will be
a wide recognition that this kind of short-term, reactionary populism is
only going to succeed in stoking up longer-term policy and electoral
problems as the next General Election approaches.
How, for example, can Labour argue for a radical commitment to
educational improvements if it condemns a modest 1% potential tax rise?
How is the Home Rule case bettered by rubbishing such an unashamed
English regionalist as our latest MP?
My pleasure at our victory this week is tempered by the image
presented of the new, rather nasty Labour Party. They have done
themselves and opposition politics no good whatsoever by the shallow
grave which they dug at this by-election. In Perth &amp; Kinross they fought
hard and fairly; in Littleborough and Saddleworth hard and unfairly.
The Blair-driven contradiction between two Labour Parties, north and
south of the Border, is becoming steadily more apparent -- and decidedly
more unattractive. The quest for English Tory votes is ripping their
soul to shreds. This week we won. But the cause of progressive politics
didn't.

KILLER! The Baddest Rock Memoir Dver.
Jerry Lee Lewis and Charles White.
Century, #16.99.
ONE of the best known stories about Jerry Lee Lewis has him on tour
with Chuck Berry -- another monstrous ego -- and battling over who
should close the show. Lewis plays his set, then sprays the piano with
gasoline and lights it. As the piano burns, he wanders into the wings
and says to Berry: ''Follow that, nigger.''
The tale is present in this putative autobiography, but the line is
rendered: ''OK Chuck, it's your turn!'', which somehow lacks the same
ring of truth. The original might not be very admirable, but it figures
from a Louisiana redneck whose talent is huge but whose personality is
probably short of sainthood.
The Killer's life story is a gift to any biographer with guts and
integrity. The jacket for this book claims that White has been
researching this book for 25 years and has taken some six years to write
it. Excluding the (excellent) discography, it runs to a mere 165 pages.
A thorough telling of the Lewis life would need that to cover his first
recordings, or one of his six wives, or his arrest for reportedly trying
to kill Elvis Presley.
The Presley incident -- Lewis turned up drunk at Graceland with a
pistol, smashed his car into the gate, and then didn't bother denying
that murdering the king if rock 'n' roll was his mission -- is just one
of many eventualities in the Lewis lifespan that White gives his hero
space to excuse. By the time White has finished with the story of
Lewis's first visit to Britain, with new bride in tow, the reader is
surely supposed to feel that it is altogether weird for a bloke to fail
to marry his 13-year-old cousin. And then dump her.
Jerry Lee Lewis is not a nice man. People die around him (two wives,
two sons). He has a contempt for society and its laws that leaves him a
fugitive from the IRS, and fortunate to have escaped more serious
punishment for drugs and firearms offences. Beside the petulance, camp,
and cant of today's pop icons he is magisterial. His only mistake has
been to live as long.
White's limited achievement has been to tape conversations with Lewis
and his family and associates -- some from other sources -- and
transcribe them, putting them in an order that makes some thematic sense
but is chronologically confusing. Only a small proportion of those few
pages are strictly Lewis's ''memoir'' and while they contain some gems
of Jerry Lee logic, their impact is almost lost next to White's own
risible imagery.
Charting the demise of TV evangelists Jimmy Lee Swaggert (Jerry Lee's
cousin) and Jim Bakker (who claimed that his $14m fraud was because
''the devil got into my computer''), White writes: ''Just as the devil
got into Jim Bakker's computer, the devil was to enter Jimmy Lee's
trousers and go straight to ecstasy control, turning his penile tissue
into an uncontrollable boa constrictor.''
For Jerry Lee, the trouser snake was often the least of his problems,
but it is White's thesis that it is Lewis's personal life -- or, more
accurately, the despicable publicity that has surrounded it -- that has
prevented him from becoming as big as Elvis. But it is more tempting to
see in rock 'n' roll's greatest white pianist the struggle more usually
associated with the black bluesman: between Satan and God, between the
Gospel and the Devil's music. That's the sort of thing that really
worries The Killer.
That and the approval of Southern womanhood: ''I don't think God will
judge me harshly. I've brought comfort to a lot of folks. Christians and
atheists, they all love Whole Lotta Shakin'. Vivien Leigh said great
balls of fire four or five times in Gone With The Wind. I never accepted
that Great Balls Of Fire was vulgar.''
In another genre the claim of the title of this slim tome would be
ludicrous. In the world of the rock book, ''the baddest ever'' is still
not the worst. But it's not very good.

A FORMER foster parent has been acquitted of allegations of indecency
involving two girls aged 12 and 13.
Mr John Wood, 48, denied two charges of lewd, indecent, and libidinous
behaviour towards the girls. Yesterday, a jury at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court took less than an hour to find him unanimously not guilty of one
charge and to find the other not proven.
The three-day trial heard that, for part of the time of the
allegations, Mr Wood was also a residential care worker at a children's
home.
Mr Wood gave evidence on his own behalf and told the jury: ''I never
touched those lassies.''
The girls had earlier claimed that he touched their breasts through
their clothing and removed or got them to remove some of their clothes.
One girl described how Mr Wood gave her a massage and told her to take
off her bra and dressing gown.
The girls, who had both been victims of sexual abuse in the past, did
not accept the suggestion from Mr Wood's advocate, Miss Joyce Powrie,
that they were telling ''a pack of lies''.
Mr Wood, of Wester Hailes Park, Edinburgh, said he and his wife Morag
had three children of their own, and had been foster parents for five to
six years.
He first became aware that some kind of allegations had been made
against him when the mother of one of the girls made an abusive phone
call to his house. He said he was in a state of confusion and shock when
he was interviewed by police.
He told depute-fiscal Margaret Graham during cross examination that he
thought one of the girls may have been attention seeking.
A 14-year-old girl told the trial that one of the girls had asked her
if she wanted to say things about Mr Wood touching her. When she refused
the girl said that she was only joking.

THREE Irish Protestant gunmen were each jailed for 20 years yesterday
for gunning down two robbers in the street.
Their victims' crime was to rob a store in Islington, North London,
that the gunmen had planned to attack themselves.
Old Bailey Judge Michael Coombe QC, told Samuel Maclean, 45, Samuel
Wilson, 32, and Joseph Brown, 37: ''It is obvious you are all ruthless
men, utterly selfish and utterly determined to enrich yourselves, no
matter how many people may be hurt physically or materially.''
A fourth member of the gang, Kenneth MacMillan, 39, who did not take
part in the Islington incident, was found guilty of robbing another
store in Notting Hill, West London, six weeks earlier, along with
Maclean. He was jailed for 12 years. Maclean, Wilson, and Brown were
convicted of two charges of attempted murder, two counts of conspiracy
to rob, robbery, and related firearms charges.
MacLean was jailed for 12 years in Belfast in 1978 for possession of
firearms, a charge relating to a gun battle between the IRA and
Loyalists in which a soldier was shot.
The robbers were caught only after a series of bizarre coincidences,
the court heard.
The trio had planned to rob the Cullens store in Islington just before
closing time on the evening of Bank Holiday Monday, April 5, last year.
However, two other armed robbers, Gary Mullins and Colin Meeks, had
the same idea and the four Irishmen watched in astonishment as the two
interlopers rushed into the store and grabbed the takings.
Realising the cash they had hoped to get from Cullens had gone, the
frustrated gang decided to ambush the other robbers, said Mr Michael
Worsley QC, prosecuting.
They followed them as they ran to their getaway car with more than
#6000 in stolen cash -- and pounced, smashing the car windows, putting
revolvers to the back of both men's heads, and pulling the triggers.
Gary Mullins is now paralysed from the neck down and, because of his
injuries, no charges are being brought against him for the robbery.
Colin Meeks had a miraculous escape and has made a 90% recovery from
his injuries. He was interviewed by police after the shooting but later
absconded before any charges could be brought.
After the shootings, the extraordinary coincidences of that night were
far from over, the court was told.
Unknown to the two gangs of robbers, burglars had broken into a Marks
and Spencer store opposite Cullens. In doing so, they had set off the
burglar alarms and, just as the two robbers in the car were being shot,
a police van arrived on the scene to investigate.
Police spotted two of the Irish team of robbers near Marks and
Spencer,and assumed they were the burglars. After a chase, both were
caught and arrested. The two other gang members were not arrested until
the following August.

PRIME Minister John Major did visit Greater Manchester on Thursday,
but his attention was turned to England's fortunes in the Test at Old
Trafford rather than those of his party up the road in the Littleborough
and Saddleworth by-election. Unfortunately for him, success on the
cricket pitch was not repeated by the Conservatives in the polling
stations.
The Tories have slumped to yet another heavy by-election defeat, an
occurrence now all too familiar. Indeed, the Conservatives have not won
a by-election since 1989.
But although John Hudson, the Tory candidate, was pushed into third
place, the scale of the Tory defeat was not as bad as of late. Their
share of the vote dropped 20% to 24%, from 44% in 1992. But this is far
less than in recent comparable English by-elections. In the past three
polls south of the Border taken by the Liberal Democrats, the top share
for the Tories was 29% in Newbury, in Christchurch it was 32%, and in
Eastleigh it was 27%.
Had the average pattern of by-elections during the past two
Parliaments been repeated on Thursday, then the Tories could have
expected a drop to about 20% in their share of the vote. Equally, the
Liberal Democrats should have been expected to poll upwards of 60% on
Thursday, if the patterns of the past few years had been matched.
Yes, their candidate Chris Davies did take the seat, but with the
lowest increase in vote share (3%) in a by-election win for the Liberal
Democrats (or the former Liberal Party) in the post-war period.
Paddy Ashdown has gone on the offensive in the aftermath of this
victory. He is still heavily questioning the tactics of the Labour
Party's campaign run by their spin doctor and MP for Hartlepool, Peter
Mandelson.
Although the Liberal Democrats were always poised to take
Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth, just how narrow the margin eventually was
over Labour must have been a little too close for comfort.
What must be far more worrying to the Liberal Democrats is their
seemingly ineffectual response to Tony Blair's shifting of the Labour
Party towards the centre of British politics.
This by-election gives further evidence that Blair's strategy, at
least in electoral terms, is proving successful. Labour's increase in
vote share of 14%, coming from third place, easily outstrips its
previous best against the Liberal Democrats in the same situation, that
of 7% last year in Eastleigh. The Liberal Democrats need to take seats
such as Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth if they are to hold out any hope of
having the balance of power at the General Election.
Yet Labour's relative success on Thursday could actually be good news
for Paddy Ashdown. The number of seats where there is a conceivable
three-party fight between Labour, Liberal Democrats, and the
Conservatives is relatively few. If Blair's New Labour were to take
votes from the Conservatives in some areas of south and south-west
England, as it did in the local elections in May, then it may well allow
up to a dozen Tory seats to be taken by the Liberal Democrats where they
strongly challenge in second place.
For Labour, Thursday was certainly a good result. To come from 20% of
the vote at the 1992 election to 34% is a large step.
Under the new constituency boundaries for the next General Election,
the seat that largely replaces Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth, namely
Oldham East &amp; Saddleworth, on the basis of Thursday's poll, would fall
to Labour with a swing of only a tenth of 1%.
Labour really would have liked to have taken this seat now, however,
and the hand of Peter Mandelson on the campaign was evidence of how hard
New Labour is willing to push to maintain its electoral momentum.
So much of the attention in this by-election has been on the two
opposition parties that the party of government, which held the seat
until the death of Geoffrey Dickens, seems to have been relegated to the
sidelines. This, curiously, was in part their own fault. The Tories gave
no press conferences in this campaign, and although some Cabinet
heavyweights pitched in, little was said of how this by-election might
bolster the party further in the wake of John Major's success in the
leadership election.
Was this by-election a missed opportunity for the Tories? One month's
evidence of a Tory fightback does not equal a revival. The real test
will come during the next few months, in the party conference season.
Then we shall see whether the Tories have come out of their ''Summer of
Discontent'' healthier and in a better position to capture a record
fifth term in office.

A MOTHER and her three children died and their father was seriously
injured when fire swept through their home yesterday.
Neighbours, alerted to the blaze by screams, fought to save the young
couple and their children but had difficulty trying to break through
double-glazed windows.
Police later identified the victims as Mrs Anne-Marie Kemp, her son
David, aged five, and daughters Jamie-Lee, four, and Carrie-Ann, two,
who were killed, and father Mr Gary Kemp, who suffered serious burns.
The blaze gutted the upstairs of their three-bedroomed semi-detached
home in Meades Avenue, Sittingbourne, Kent.
Carrie-Ann was taken out alive from the building but died from her
injuries soon afterwards in hospital.
Mr Kemp, 25, was rushed to the specialist burns unit at East Grinstead
Hospital, Sussex, where he was said to be in a ''critical condition''.
Neighbour Michael Lock said: ''There were about 20 people all trying
to smash the windows but they had double glazing on the windows and they
could not get at them.''
Another neighbour, Mr Steve Martin, said: ''I heard the kids screaming
inside and so I grabbed a ladder and dashed back to the house.
''I put the ladder up but by the time I got to the top, there was
silence -- I can only assume the children were either unconscious or
were already dead.''
Local resident Mr Ivan Bowden said of Mr Kemp: ''The poor guy was
sitting on his lawn. He was terribly burned and he was holding his head
in his hands, crying over and over again, 'My babies, my babies'.''
It was thought he tried to save his family before fleeing from the
flames.
Kent Divisional Fire Officer Paul Trewin said: ''This is the most
tragic fire I have ever been to . . .
''The fire started in one of the bedrooms and spread very quickly,
which was caused by the type of furnishings we like to have in our homes
these days.''
He added: ''We are still trying to find the exact cause of the fire
but it is looking like an accident rather than suspicious.''
Friends and neighbours wept in the street.
A friend of the family said: ''It was terrible. I heard the father
screaming for someone to save his children.
''They were a model family. One of the most genuine you could ever
hope to meet.''
Mr Steven Howlett, chief executive of the housing association which
owns the house, said: ''We are very distressed to hear this horrendous
news of this awful tragedy.
''This has never happened in the history of the association and we are
offering counselling for any local residents who feel they may need
it.''
Fire officers rescued one member of the household unharmed -- a
labrador puppy.

A CHILDREN'S festival on the River Clyde has been cancelled because of
a higher than normal level of bacteria in the water, which could pose a
health risk.
Glasgow District Council said yesterday that the 1995 River Clyde
Festival, which was due to take place at Glasgow Green on August 6, has
been cancelled on the advice of its health officials.
The council-organised event was to have involved activities such as
canoeing and rowing.
The council's parks and recreation department said the weather during
the summer -- flash floods followed by heatwaves -- had caused the
sewage levels on the river to increase.
Mr Brian Kelly, director of environmental health, said the public
should not be alarmed and stressed that the event was cancelled as a
precaution.
He said the council became concerned after some canoeists became ill
after using the river recently.

James Holloway looks at the decorative works of the Norie family and
its influence on design
THE Norie family ran the most successful decorative painting business
in Scotland in the eighteenth century. By 1720 it had eclipsed its
rivals to emerge as the leading firm of house-painters in the country, a
position it retained for at least 50 years.
The founder of the firm was James Norie senior. He created a business
which offered his clients decorative landscape schemes, as well as
general house-painting. James Norie and his family were the first
Scottish artists to paint landscapes, and several of the most important
landscape painters of the eighteenth century served their
apprenticeships in the Norie workshops.
For the most part the Nories painted idealised landscapes, in
grisaille, often a monochrome sage-green or lilac. The landscapes showed
waterfalls and ruins, fishermen and shepherds, and belong to a tradition
of European decorative painting, the closest parallels to which can be
found in Italian or Italo-Flemish art.
Many can still be seen in the rooms for which they were painted but
their effect, even when restored to their original settings can now only
be seen in isolation.
As fashion in interior decoration changed, all the subsidiary parts of
the Nories' schemes, their graining and marbling, were painted over,
leaving only a few important landscape panels still visible. Ironically,
the elimination of their context has had the effect of over-emphasising
the importance of the surviving paintings, leaving them to be judged as
independent works of art.
James Norie was Master Painter to the Board of Ordnance in North
Britain, being paid for work at Fort Augustus, Fort William, and
Edinburgh Castle but, after James's death in 1757, it was his son Robert
who succeeded him to the lucrative post.
The Norie family's connection with this important government agency
may well have resulted from the strong links it had with the Adam
family. William Adam, active with the Nories in the creation of an art
school in Edinburgh in 1729, had been appointed Mason to the Board of
Ordnance the following year.
For the next 20 years, the two families often worked together, William
Adam building and the Nories decorating the same houses. Indeed the list
of projects where both were employed -- Arniston, Caroline Park, Haddo,
Hopetoun, Mavisbank, and Yester as well as many smaller houses -- reads
like a roll-call of many of the most important architectural projects of
the century.
The business connection, strongly apparent between James Norie senior
and William Adam, weakened after the death of the latter in 1748.
The heyday of the Norie family had been the 1730s and 1740s, when, in
town and country houses, the painters had produced a large number of
fresh and lively decorative schemes complementing the vigorous
architecture and plasterwork of William Adam and his tradesmen.

THE launch of a cut-price passenger air service between Prestwick and
London has been postponed because of ''unforeseen regulatory delays''.
A number of politicians and dignitaries had been due to join directors
of PIK, the operators of Prestwick Airport, at a launch in Glasgow on
Monday. It was announced late yesterday, however, that the event had
been put back until mid-August.
The news is a setback to airport chief executive Matthew Hudson's
attempt to further establish Prestwick as a major player in UK aviation.
He declined to comment yesterday on the reasons for the delay.
It is understood PIK will establish a franchise arrangement with an
existing small airline significantly to undercut prices of the
established cross-border carriers such as British Airways, British
Midland, and Air UK.
Mr Hudson has made it clear he will make every effort possible to
break what he views as the over-priced monopoly on UK routes and it is
likely that, if the Prestwick/London service gets off the ground, it
will be a no-frills operation aimed at the volume market.
It is not clear what regulatory delays may have hit the launch. From
1997, there will be an open-skies policy throughout Europe, with any
airline able to fly the routes of any other member state.
If the airline involved with PIK is an established one, it will
already be in possession of all the necessary certification of aircraft
and crews required by the Civil Aviation Authority.
A CAA spokesman said: ''If you want to start up an airline you need
suitable aircraft, crews, operating certificates and licences and the
support of the airports concerned. Once the air traffic control slots
have been obtained, you are more or less ready for take-off.''
It is these all-important slots which make it all but impossible for
Prestwick to be linked with either of the major London gateways at
Heathrow or Gatwick.
It is far more likely that the Ayrshire airport, taken over from BAA
by a private consortium headed by Lord Younger in April 1992, will be
linked with either Stansted or Luton airports. There should be no
difficulties acquiring slots at either, although the former would be
preferable as it has a fast train link with Victoria Station.
Meanwhile, further new services between Scotland and England are
expected to be announced in the coming weeks by a new operator, Easy
Jet.
The company, owned by the Greek shipping magnate Stelios Haji-Ioannou,
wants to introduce the concept of the low-cost, no-frills operation
which has become popular in the United States.
Easy Jet wants to be in at the start of European open skies and is
looking at both Glasgow and Edinburgh airports with a view to linking
them with Stansted or Luton.

THE home of Scottish rugby could find a close-season life as a major
rock venue on the international map.
As a huge team of workers cleared up after Thursday night's concert by
REM, the Scottish Rugby Union did not rule out future extravaganzas in
the showpiece multi-million pound stadium.
SRU marketing manager, Ms Laura Dick, said the condition of the pitch
did not appear to be too bad after taking a pounding from thousands of
dancing fans.
Prior to the concert, she said a decision had been taken to cut back
on the use of the pitch during the close season but this could be
reviewed given its condition after the rock concert, attended by more
than 46,000 fans.
''It would be nice to think the new-look Murrayfield could become a
major badly-needed venue on the east coast. We haven't ruled out the
possibility of a further big-name concert next year,'' she said.
The news will be met with dismay by local residents, who have long
opposed the use of the stadium as a rock venue.
District councillor Mrs Christine Richard said she had received a
barrage of complaints and had strongly opposed the concert when it came
before the council for licensing approval.
''Murrayfield is unsuitable for this kind of activity because of noise
levels. Out-of-town venues such as Ingliston are far more appropriate,''
said Mrs Richard.
A council spokeswoman said only a handful of complaints had been
received from members of the public.
A team of eight environmental health officers were monitoring noise
levels within the stadium.
''The results will be compared with previous concerts by U2 and David
Bowie to see what difference the new enclosed stadium has made,'' the
spokeswoman added.
Meanwhile, the fans were branded litter louts by Edinburgh District
Council. A team of eight workers had to be diverted from its usual
Princes Street beat to sweep up nearly nine tonnes of rubbish left
behind by the crowd.
An undercover operation on a team of counterfeiters, from as far
afield as Manchester and Ireland, by trading standards officers and
police netted #50,000 of fake merchandise, including T-shirts and
programmes.
Police said the concert had been relatively trouble free and praised
the crowd for its conduct. Only four fans were arrested, for minor
offences, and a further five were ejected from the stadium.
Hundreds were treated for dehydration in sweltering temperatures and
two were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

A QC yesterday defended the decision by senior law officers not to
start contempt of court proceedings against tabloid newspapers following
complaints about their reporting of the Taylor sisters' murder trial.
A ''value judgment'' was made by Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell
and Solicitor General Sir Derek Spencer that there was ''no substantial
risk of serious prejudice'' being caused by the articles, the High Court
in London was told.
It was a judgment they were fully entitled to make ''in the public
interest'' and not open to challenge in the courts, said their QC,
Phillip Havers. The decision was neither ''irrational nor
unreasonable''.
He was defending the senior law officers against accusations by
Michelle and Lisa Taylor that they had wrongly failed to prosecute the
''tormentor'' tabloids -- the Sun, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, and Daily
Express -- following publication of a series of ''outrageous'' contempts
which put their chances of receiving a fair trial in jeopardy.
The sisters, of Forest Hill, London, were sentenced to life
imprisonment in July 1992 for the murder of bank clerk Alison
Shaughnessy, the wife of Michelle's former lover.
A year later, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions because
prejudicial publicity and material irregularities at the trial made the
verdicts unsafe and unsatisfactory. The court asked the Attorney General
to consider bringing contempt proceedings against the newspapers
involved.
No action was taken and, last December, Michelle, 25, and Lisa, 22,
were granted leave for a judicial review of a decision by the Solicitor
General, acting on behalf of the Attorney General, who said it would not
be appropriate to bring contempt proceedings.
Mr Havers told Lord Justice Stuart Smith, sitting with Mr Justice
Butterfield, the trial jury should be credited ''with some independence
of mind''.
Although the publications complained of were misleading to ordinary
members of the public, they were unlikely to have misled those present
at the trial.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for the sisters, told the court that it
''simply would not do'' to say the decision not to prosecute was a
''value judgment'' and allow the newspapers to get away with it. The law
of contempt was ''not an elastic law''.
He added: ''The press, having got away with this, and been given an
inch, will take another inch next time.
''Failure to prosecute notorious cases is a signal.''
Lord Justice Taylor said the court would give its judgment on Monday.

<HEADLINE>Future staff changes raise fears for parents about 24-hour care at East Park Home. Pledge for handicapped children</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALAN MACDERMID, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A DIRECTOR of the troubled East Park Home and School in Glasgow
yesterday promised that the care it provides for 45 profoundly
handicapped children would continue.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, a leading industrialist, dismissed a suggestion
that East Park would be cut to eight places, with the other children
going home or to other community facilities.
The suggestion, described by Sir Matthew as ''ridiculous'', was in a
report prepared within Strathclyde social work department. Rumours about
it have alarmed both staff and parents of children at the home, who
depend on the 24-hour care it provides.
''There are some very caring parents who visit regularly. They are
very worried that they are going to be told they would have to look
after their children at home, or they will not be properly cared for,''
said Sir Matthew. He acknowledged that looking after such a child could
have a devastating effect on a family, with other children neglected and
marriages breaking up because of the needs of the handicapped child.
He admitted that the Community Care Act was putting pressure on East
Park to go in that direction, but he said: ''No-one is going to be told
that their child has to come home. The social work department refers
children here but once they are here they are our responsibility.
''The funding we get is on a head-by-head basis. Even if they withdrew
that for a particular child, we have our own funding to keep them here.
I am sure the public would make sure that did not happen. But it is not
a threat the social services have ever made.''
There are, however, major changes in the staffing structure, which
will erode the demarcation between the teachers at the school and the
nurses and auxiliaries at the adjacent home.
They will result in 50 redundancies, but Sir Matthew said 30 new jobs
would be available for which those being made redundant would be able to
apply. There would be one category of carer, and the present auxiliaries
could aspire to promotion to the higher grades denied to them now.
''We are putting through a modernisation programme involving staff
training, refurbishment, and changes in rotas, as a result of which the
number of jobs will be reduced from 240 to 220.
''We believe it will lead to a better East Park and to better
facilities for the children.''
However, the restructuring began dramatically in March when the matron
for eight years, Mrs Eleanor McCreadie, 55, was dismissed. Sir Matthew
said the circumstances of that were sub-judice, because it is expected
to be the subject of an industrial tribunal.
The moves followed an independent review carried out at the request of
the directors by a panel nominated by members of the staff, including
Mrs McCreadie, said Sir Matthew.
They were Dr Kenneth McAlpine, a geriatrician from the Royal Alexandra
Hospital in Paisley; Mr Alistair Milne, a retired H M Inspector of
Schools; Miss Eleanor Martin, director of nursing at Yorkhill NHS Trust;
and Mr David Warnock, unit physiotherapist at Stobhill Hospital.
Dr McAlpine was nominated by the administrator, Mrs May Henderson, who
has taken over as general manager at the home. It has emerged that he is
her boyfriend. Mrs Henderson is divorced.
Sir Matthew said he had not known about this relationship. ''Nothing
wrong with that, none of my business, but when I found out I satisfied
myself that the report was impartial. There were three other people
involved in the review, don't forget. There was no disclosure to
anyone.''
He said the resignation of Mrs McCreadie's successor, Sister Isobel
Stewart, had been amicable. She had been persuaded to take on the job on
a trial basis then opted for redundancy, but was still working at the
home at present.
''The matron's post has been changed to that of care manager, who will
be more responsible for the care of the children and less responsible
for the kitchens, for example,'' said Sir Matthew.
''There is a regrading of posts. We are offering people who may be
untrained the opportunity to apply for a more advanced job, which will
require training.
''Everyone will get a pay increase. They will will work reduced hours
and re-allocate the rotas. But the teachers won't have the long
seven-week summer holiday.''
East Park has annual running costs of #2.2m, which works out at around
#50,000 per patient.
Ms Pauline McNeil, regional orgainser of the health union GMB, said
yesterday: ''We are concerned about the contents of this review because
we have not been allowed to see it.
''We accept the integration of the school and home staff. But most of
the enrolled nurses are to go, and we see the care for these children as
very much nursing care. But we are being given a lengthy period of
negotiation.''

A NEWSPAPER publisher yesterday accepted substantial, undisclosed
libel damages over an article which implied he was guilty of misleading
the City, and his minority shareholders.
His counsel, Mr Charles Gray QC, told Mr Justice Maurice Kay in the
High Court in London that the story in Business Age magazine in April
contained a ''grave and unwarranted'' libel on the character and
integrity of his client, Telegraph group chairman Conrad Black.
''Mr Black is not prepared to tolerate aspersions of any kind on his
business probity. The allegation that he has deliberately suppressed
information which is material to the market in the Telegraph shares so
as to enrich himself at the expense of minority shareholders is
untrue.''
He said the article was about Mr Black's plans to reorganise his
international business operations which included a proposal by his
Canadian company, Hollinger, to purchase through its American subsidiary
all the minority shareholdings in The Telegraph.
It went on to imply that Mr Black was seeking to mislead City
institutions and the minority shareholders of The Telegraph as to the
true worth of the shares which he was proposing to buy through
Hollinger's subsidiary.
The suggestion was reinforced by the heading, ''Who is he trying to
kid? Will Conrad Black get away with it?''
It insinuated that information had been deliberately suppressed about
the true value of the Telegraph's minority holdings in an Australian
company, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, as well as in a Canadian company,
Southam Inc.
Mr Gray said no material information was withheld as to the value of
the Telegraph's stake in those companies.
The article was also seriously flawed in its approach to the valuation
of the company. The value placed on its shares in the article was
erroneous.
Mr Gray said Mr Black had repeatedly and publicly made clear his
judgment was that the share price of the business reflected
over-discounting by the market.
There was no justification for the imputation that he was attempting
to dupe the minority shareholders into selling their shares at a low
price.
The article contained another ''equally false'' charge that Mr Black
had been guilty of deception in connection with the sale by Hollinger in
May 1994 of 12.5 million shares in the Telegraph in that he had
concealed from the purchasers his intention to make a substantial
reduction in the cover price of the Daily Telegraph.
Mr Gray said the facts were that, five weeks after the sale of the
shares, a Telegraph management committee recommended, following the
publication in June 1994 of the circulation gain achieved by the Times
during the previous month, that the cover price of the Daily Telegraph
should be reduced. Mr Black accepted the recommendation.
This took place after the sale of shares by Hollinger. The Stock
Exchange, having conducted an inquiry, was satisfied that Mr Black had
not been guilty of any wrongdoing.
Solicitor David Price, for VNU Business Publications Ltd, said the
magazine never intended to accuse Mr Black of any impropriety but now
accepted that the article would have been understood by its readers in
the manner outlined by Mr Gray.
The magazine acknowledged that there was abolutely no truth in the
implicit accusation that Mr Black had twice within the past year engaged
in the deliberate suppression of information so as to enrich himself at
the expense of minority shareholders.
It unreservedly accepted Mr Black's assurance that he had not at any
time treated any minority shareholder unfairly.
It apologised for the embarrassment and irritation caused and had
agreed to pay him a substantial sum in damages.

GREAT fluffy clouds spinning endlessly around the Tete de la Dame, a
religious recluse who occupies a shelter in the dark forest but
advertises himself with a sign nailed to a tree declaring ''Hermit This
Way''; an eagle plunging on to the high pastures out of a scalding sun;
Thierry's devastating vin blanc and Rob Roy playing to packed houses at
the Palais, Valence. Ah yes, holidays are an education. I'd almost
forgotten.
A world of forests, mountains, sunshine, and wine is about as far
removed from the stark, flat-earth landscape of Orkney as is
conceivable. And yet on our trip to the Drome Valley in the southern
French Alps -- the first Hewitson family holiday in a decade -- we were
conscious of pressures and problems which mirrored those of rural
Scotland.
Here on the edge of the Atlantic, it's easy to feel oppressed,
forgotten, far away from the decision-making process, no longer master
of your own destiny. It's also easy to imagine, I believe, that we are
alone in adversity. This, of course, is a myth. Our plight is that of
many far-flung communities in Europe -- depopulation, changes in
traditional industries, social upheaval.
Take transport, for instance. Returning on the long trek north we were
aware that the honourable and important fight to retain rail services
and lines north of Inverness is still being waged. I've always felt that
if the dogma of profitability was allowed to become the main guideline
for living in the remoter parts of our nation, then we would very soon
have an empty land. Our rural environment cries out for co-operation,
not confrontation.
In rural France there has, in the past half century, been a steady
drift away from the land to Paris and a wheen of provincial towns, just
as there has been from the distant isles of Orkney to population
centres. In the Drome Valley, a landscape of perched and often
half-empty villages, there has been a long-running campaign to retain
the rail line between Valence and Briancon (the highest town in France,
I'm told).
Near the ancient market town of Die, once an important town in Roman
Gaul, there is a painted slogan on a cutting wall which speaks
eloquently, even for the amateur linguist, of the importance of the
track to the Drome Valley -- ''Ligne de Die -- Ligne de Vie''.
This campaign has been running for a decade and the line, meantime,
remains open (a steam train outing was planned the weekend we left).
Constant vigilance will be necessary if a similar outcome is to be
achieved in the north of Scotland.
Then there were the sheep. Having got the late lambing out of the way
on Papa Westray, and having seen all our ewes and lambs settled in the
pasture south o' Tirlo, we were ready for some sheepless nights.
Then we arrived in Die to find ourselves in the midst of the
Transhumance or ''Shove Yer Sheep Up A Mountain'' Festival. Two thousand
ewes run through the town for the benefit of the tourists before being
''bused'' to the high summer pastures.
In the local weekly newspaper a 93-year-old shepherd from Saint Julien
remembered the days when the sheep were walked along the roads from
grazings in the south. Needless to say, with every French driver
performing as if they were looking for pole position on the Grand Prix
grid, sheep walk the roads no more.
Back here in the flatlands 20mph is reckoned a break-neck pace.

CAMELOT last night confirmed it is to expand its National Lottery
ticket machines and Instant win scratch cards into public houses.
The announcement came as the Lottery organiser revealed it had handed
out #1 billion to 40 million winners since the game was launched last
November -- a prize for nearly every adult who has played the game.
Lottery machines and thousands of Instant win scratch cards will be
moved into dozens of public houses within the next few weeks, as part of
a six- month trial operation.
If the trial run is successful, Camelot plans to expand the operation
to pubs and clubs across Scotland.
Legislation allows publicans to sell Instant win scratch cards and
Lottery tickets without the need to apply for a gaming licence and is
being touted as a means to boost bar takings and Lottery funds.
A Camelot spokesman heralded the plans, adding: ''The more people
spend on the Lottery means the more money for charities.''
The move has also been welcomed by the Scottish Licensed Traders
Association, who say it will be a boost for a depressed licensed trade.
The announcement came as Camelot revealed that Scots splash out #6.5m
on Lottery tickets and #4m on scratch cards every week.
According to official statistics released yesterday, 227 people have
won a jackpot, with 15 wins topping #5m and 78 topping #1m.
National Lottery punters in North-west England appear the luckiest,
raking in #139m in winnings. #120m has gone to Yorkshire and #55m to the
North-east.
Greater London has scooped #215m but this represents a lower share in
relation to tickets bought.
Camelot says #21m in winnings has gone to Northern Ireland, #86m to
Scotland, #75m to Wales, #150m to the Midlands, #63m to eastern England,
#23m to the South-west, and #69m to the South-east.

A SHAREHOLDERS' group which challenged Scottish Pride directors on
their running of the company faces a #20,000 legal bill after failing
yesterday to win the support of shareholders at the company's first
annual meeting.
The company, which has its headquarters in Govan, is a major player in
the milk and cheese markets in Scotland and, before deregulation last
year, was the manufacturing and retailing arm of the old Scottish Milk
Marketing Board.
The majority of its 3000 shareholders are dairy farmers who were
issued with shares at the time of deregulation. Earlier this year a
shareholders' association was formed, representing about 200 farmers who
expressed concerns about the future of creameries at Kirkcudbright,
Rothesay, Arran, and Campbeltown. They also questioned arrangements for
directors buying shares in the company and claimed that directors had
been able to buy at a time when other potential buyers were told there
were no shares available.
The company's stockbrokers subsequently admitted that there had been
one occasion when an order to buy shares had been refused when it could
have been fulfilled. This was due to human error, they said, and the
prospective buyer's order had later been fulfilled, with the
stockbrokers meeting additional costs involved.
It was also explained that the directors had operated under an
agreement that any purchases by them would be completed only after all
other buying instructions had been fulfilled.
Mr Michael McCreath, of Garlieston Home Farm, Newton Stewart,
secretary of the shareholders' association, said he expected legal and
professional bills of between #15,000 and #20,000 from the association's
advisers. He was confident, however, that donations would be received to
cover that amount. The association had about 250 members, he said.
At the annual meeting, one of the association members, Mr Archie
Boreman, of Kilmarnock, argued that Scottish Pride should pick up the
association's bill. The dissident shareholders had acted in the
interests of all shareholders and had exposed confusion over share
dealings, he said.
In recent weeks share prices had moved from 38p to 60p, adding #7.5m
to the value of Scottish Pride. Lack of communication had been the
problem, he claimed.

<TEXT>
GRUNTS and groans coming from the depths of Loch Ness have puzzled a
mini-submarine's operator and pilot.
It left them wondering: was this the first time anyone has heard the
sound of Nessie?
They were heard over the headphones of their communications radio-sets
by Mr Bill Bolton on the submarine and by the company chief, Mr Alan
Whitfield, at the mini-sub's lochside base at the Clansman Marina, near
Drumnadrochit.
The two men listened to the unexplained sounds for half an hour, then
they faded away.
They had been picked up on the same radio frequency on which has been
heard the ''singing sounds'' of whales and dolphins communicating,
between 10 and 17 Khz.
Mr Bishop said: ''I have frequently heard the calls of these
sea-mammals when I have done dives in the North Sea and in the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, but this was quite different.
''It certainly poses a few very interesting questions, does it not?''
At the time, the mini-sub was involved in a scientific dive,
collecting data and shooting video footage of the rock-structure of a
spectacular underwater Loch Ness canyon with 350ft high walls of pink
granite cliffs, which lies beneath the surface off Abriachan.
Edinburgh-born Alan operates the Loch Ness Submarine and is busy just
now with trippers looking for the Highland holiday experience with a
difference.
Mr Bishop, who also operates the Loch Ness submarine for visitors,
estimates the grunts and groans they heard on their headphones came from
about 500ft beneath the surface. Loch Ness has a maximum depth of almost
800ft.
This is the second year that the Loch Ness submarine has been
available for underwater trips at the loch at #68 per passengers.
The Canadian-built vessel was designed to rescue crews of submarines
stranded on the sea-bed, and it is capable of going down to 1000ft.
The vessel uses powerful strobe-lights to pierce the underwater gloom,
but pointing the beams in the general direction of the source of the
sounds shed no light on the mystery.
Some scientists have said that if Nessie does exist, she must be part
of a breeding colony. Doing what comes quite naturally could be one
explanation for the sounds.
* There was a recent report in an American newspaper, sold in
supermarkets, which claimed Nessie had been captured by a British
scientific expedition using a big net.
It even used photo-manipulation to ''prove' that the story was true.

FANATICAL animal lover Jean Knowlson, the ''Pigeon Lady of Purley'',
was in sheltered accommodation last night after spending four days in
prison.
Mrs Knowlson, 68, had been jailed for 28 days on Monday for breaking a
court order banning her from feeding birds withbag-loads of
environmentally unfriendly bread.
Yesterday, however, she appeared at the High Court and promised Mr
Justice Buxton she would not break the orders in future.
The judge authorised her release and she left Holloway Prison to be
escorted to a waiting taxi by her solicitor.
However, she could not return to her old address in Brantwood Road,
Purley Oaks, south London, where she looked after retired draughtsman
Alan White in exchange for free accommodation.
Mr White, 66, who took Mrs Knowlson in after she was evicted from her
previous home, said he could not house her again.
He added that the pigeons, which had been a menace, were now finally
starting to disperse from the house.
Council officials in Croydon last night said Mrs Knowlson had accepted
an offer of a one-bedroom flat in a warden-assisted sheltered housing
block and that her needs would be fully assessed next week.

* NIGHTJARS are crepuscular. Just as the gorse and birch lose their
outlines and imagination starts to make up your eyes' deficiency, you
realise that something is tilting round you a few yards away. You see
long wings silhouetted on the grey sky, then lose them against the dark
heather. The bird is bigger than you expect and nearer.
White flashes on the male's wing and tail tips flicker and glide. A
clicking call, and suddenly a handclap of wings, echoed further across
the heath. Then from a different direction that noise begins -- a churr,
a jar, a wheel, a ratchet, a spinner, a grinder -- the old names echo
the sonorous reeling which makes your spine tingle in the dark.
Nightjars are seen less often than ever now because their breeding
range has contracted and also fewer people walk at night on lowland
heaths. They are rare, scattered, and unpredictable, maybe a few in
Galloway and Arran, Speyside or the Borders. Their numbers have declined
since the 1930s but may have increased in the past few years.
Thomas Hardy coolly observed the ''dewfall hawk, crossing the shades
to alight on the wind-warped upland thorn''. But since Aristotle it has
been accused of sucking goats' milk when it flies among livestock in the
dark, bristle-edged gape trawling for insects.
Among such mysteries you feel it is the human imagination which is
seriously weird. Though they fly from south of the Sahara in May and
return in August, they seem to inhabit a half-light between reason and
superstition, their definition as insubstantial as the curious shapes
wheeling round you in the gloaming.

THE controversial chairman of Lomond Healthcare NHS trust resigned
last night less than four months after his appointment.
Businessman Stephen Newall, 63, became the first Scottish trust
chairman to quit because of ''very substantial and irreconcilable
differences'' between himself and Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
Senior staff at the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria were called
in to be told of the news as Mr Newall left home in Rhu, Dunbartonshire,
for a family holiday.
His wife said: ''If he has any statement to make, he will telephone
you. He has already left.''
The decision will embarrass Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, a
former Health Minister, who initiated the Government's NHS reforms in
Scotland.
Mr Jim Devine, senior officer for the health union Unison, said: ''It
shows the cracks, strains, and stresses that prevail with the so-called
management in the Scottish NHS.''
Mr Newall's departure was announced by trust chief executive Stephen
Hayes, who said: ''The chairman has offered his resignation to the
Secretary of State because of very substantial and irreconcilable
differences between himself and the Argyll and Clyde Health Board.''
Mr Hayes denied there were any disagreements between Mr Newall and the
trust, which regretted his resignation.
''The trust has an effective management team in place and the
management executive of the NHS in Scotland are satisfied with the
performance of the trust,'' he added.
Privately, however, senior medical and nursing staff at the hospital
have voiced disapproval at Mr Newall's vigorous managerial style. A
former officer in the Parachute Regiment, he took a hands-on approach
which some saw as meddling in matters which should not concern the
chairman.
A spokeswoman for Argyll and Clyde Health Council said Mr Newall's
departure was ''sad and unsettling''.
''It is bound to blunt staff morale,'' she added.
''This is something I would have expected the health board and trust
to have sorted out before it reached a point of resignation.''
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
described Mr Newall's resignation as ''astonishing'' but added: ''The
real work of delivering health care will go on as usual.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''We regret Dr Newall feels unable
to continue as chairman.''
Mr Newall was appointed to the part-time post which carries an annual
salary of #17,000 by former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Mr Newall had been seeking money from the board for initiatives in the
trust area which extends from Erskine Bridge to Argyll.
His initial statements on how he intended to run the trust and his
refusal to co-opt a Church of Scotland minister led to an outcry.
Mr Newall later bowed to pressure and appointed the minister.
However, he made it clear he wanted to run things his own way. There
would be no room for clock-watching under the new regime and this
included highly-paid consultants.
Mr Newall has had a successful career in business and Scottish
society.
He was born in Bearsden in 1931 and educated at Loretto School before
serving a commission with the Parachute Regiment. He married Gay
Sommerville Craig and bringing up a family of four sons and one daughter
at their home in Rhu.
Mr Newall is from a wealthy background -- his father, Mr Archibald
Newall, was a Scots industrialist and an uncle, Mr Kenneth Newall, was
also wealthy.
He was managing director of Bulten-Kanthal Stephen Newall for 13 years
until 1980.
He is a former chairman of the Epilepsy Association of Scotland, a
chairman of the finance committee of Strathclyde University, and a
council member of the Scottish Business School.
In 1985, he became the Scottish Secretary's nominee on the Court of
Cranfield and the chairman of Strathclyde University Court.
He is a Deputy Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire.
He gave evidence in the trial last August of his two nephews,
Roderick, 30, and Mark, 29, who were convicted at Jersey Crown Court of
murdering their parents, Nicholas and Elizabeth Newall, seven years
previously.
Outside the courtroom, he has always refused to talk about his role in
snaring one of the nephews who killed his twin brother.
Mr Newall helped bring Roderick to justice when he secretly taped his
confession to the killing after inviting him for tea at a country hotel
in Perthshire.

TWO British women were convicted last night of conspiracy to murder a
senior American legal official when they were members of a religious
cult a decade ago.
A federal jury in Portland, Oregon, found Sally-Anne Croft and Susan
Hagan -- former followers of free-love guru Baghwan Shree Rajneesh --
guilty of conspiring in a 1985 plot to kill US attorney, Mr Charles
Turner.
The women, who were extradited to the United States last year after a
four-year fight in the British courts, now face possible life sentences
for their part in a plot which was never executed.
The jury deliberated for nearly four days after hearing two weeks of
evidence.
Prosecutors presented 29 witnesses against Croft, 45, and Hagan, 48,
including several former cult members who placed them at meetings where
a plot was hatched to kill Mr Turner.
Mr Turner, who has since retired, led a grand jury investigation that
resulted in charges of widespread immigration fraud at the cult's vast
commune in central Oregon.
Defence lawyers offered only a single witness, choosing instead to try
to discredit the key prosecution witnesses as known liars out to protect
their own futures under plea-bargain arrangements.
Croft, an accountant who was the cult's chief financial officer,
provided funding for gun-buying trips associated with the murder plot,
according to witnesses.
Hagan, an aromatherapist, was also implicated as a top official in the
cult hierarchy.
Rajneesh, who left the US after pleading guilty to arranging sham
marriages of his followers for immigration purposes, died in his native
India in 1990.
Neither Croft nor Hagan showed any emotion when the verdicts were
read.
However, in the gallery, Hagan's 19-year-old daughter, Kate, gasped
and sank her face into her hands.
After the jury, the judge, and all the lawyers had left the courtroom,
the British teenager continued to sob as her mother put her arms around
her and spoke softly to her.
Halfway through deliberations, US District Judge Malcolm Marsh had
told jurors to make another attempt to break their deadlock after they
had passed him a note saying they were unable to reach a verdict.
Last night, Marsh allowed Croft and Hagan to remain free pending
sentencing, which was set for October 16.
Both face a possible life-term in prison but sentencing guidelines
probably will allow them to receive lesser terms.
During the trial, prosecutors produced rust-covered guns, found in a
drained lake bed, that witnesses said were to be used in the killing.
They also showed surveillance photographs of Turner's house taken by
cult followers.
Prosecutors contended that Turner's immigration probe threatened the
existence of the commune and provided the motive for murder.
Many of the followers, including Croft and Hagan, were foreigners, and
sham marriages were arranged to allow them to stay in the US, witnesses
testified.
Three of the seven who were indicted in the case remain at large
overseas. Two of those indicted reached plea deals. Four others were
unindicted co-conspirators.
Baghwan Shree Rajneesh lived at the Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon
with thousands of his followers from 1981 to late 1985. The plot was
abandoned, witnesses said, shortly before the commune collapsed late in
1985 when Rajneesh admitted immigration fraud and left the country.

THE Government yesterday apologised in open court to a television
journalist and agreed to pay him #55,000 in damages and costs for
comments contained in letters signed by Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine about a Channel 4 documentary.
It is believed to be the first time that a journalist has successfully
sued the Government for libel.
The action in the High Court in London followed the screening on
January 11 of The Torture Trail, a documentary film in the Dispatches
series that exposed the willingness of Glasgow company ICL Technical
Plastics and other firms to supply electro-shock weapons to foreign
countries.
Following the broadcast, Mr Heseltine, then President of the Board of
Trade, and two of his junior Ministers -- Mr Ian Taylor and Mr Richard
Needham -- signed letters to viewers who had complained that the
Government was seemingly supporting a trade in weapons that could be
used in torture.
The letters described the allegations contained in the programme as
contrived and scaremongering. They also suggested that journalist Martyn
Gregory, who had posed as an undercover arms dealer in the film, had
persuaded the companies in question to offer to supply goods to make a
story that otherwise did not exist.
Yesterday, the DTI acknowledged that the allegations contained in the
letters were untrue and should never have been made.
''I am delighted,'' Mr Gregory said after the court hearing. ''This is
an important victory for investigative journalism .''
Mr Stephen Suttle, counsel for the DTI, said that while the department
sincerely apologised to Mr Gregory, the Government was satisfied there
was no truth in claims made by a representative of the Royal Ordnance
Division of British Aerospace in the programme.
Filmed by a secret camera, the BAe employee said his company had
supplied electric shock batons to Saudi Arabia under cover of the
government-to-government Al-Yamamah arms deal.
''The department is also satisfied that the claim made by Mr Frank
Stott, managing director of ICL Technical Plastics Ltd, that he had
visited China with assistance from the Government to sell electric shock
batons, was false.''
Mr Peter Salmon, Channel 4's controller of factual programmes, said
the Government climbdown ended a smear campaign against one of the
finest investigative programmes made this year.
''Serious questions must now be asked about why such claims were made
in the first place,'' he said. ''Why did Ministers libel our
journalists, rather than take the opportunity provided by this programme
to reappraise Government policy on the sale of weapons that can be used
for torture to brutal and oppressive regimes?''
Labour, meanwhile, accused Mr Heseltine of soaring to new heights of
arrogance. The party claimed the total cost to the taxpayer -- taking in
legal fees on both sides -- could be around #100,000.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott wrote to the Prime Minister
demanding to know whether there was any precedent for taxpayers footing
the bill for libel damages against the Government.
''Whatever the explanation, the public will be outraged that Mr
Heseltine has used the cover of his Government office to carry out
politically motivated attacks on the integrity of a journalist,'' he
said.
A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said Labour's
#100,000 figure for the total cost to the taxpayer was a ''gross
over-estimate''.

One small company is leading the fight to revegetate our land with
native forests. Peter Evans finds the move not only has aesthetic and
environmental benefits, but is creating niche market spin-offs
Native trees contribute tremendously to the landscape value of the
Highlands
IF YOU go down to the woods 20 or 30 years from now, you're sure of a
big surprise -- compared to the way much of the woodland in Scotland
looks today.
Foresters in the public and private sectors have been forced to
re-think their attitudes. Thanks to pressure from an
environmentally-conscious public, bitterly opposed to regimented blocks
of conifers, and to the Woodland Grant Scheme which encourages
landowners to increase species diversity, things are looking up for
native trees.
It's just as well, if we are going to save the few remnants of the
great Forest of Caledon that blanketed most of Scotland 8000 years ago.
Now only 2% of the land mass is covered by native species: predominantly
Scots pine, birch and oak, but also ash, hazel and alder.
They are beautiful trees, brought to their present parlous scarcity by
thousands of years of clearance, development and neglect.
Hardly any native woodlands have survived in the Scottish lowlands --
apart from some good pockets in Renfrewshire and the Clyde Valley. The
lowland woods were the first to go after the last Ice Age, cleared for
agriculture to the extent that most had disappeared by the Middle Ages.
Destruction in the Highlands came later, but because of the rugged
nature of the land, it was not quite as widespread. Consequently more
than 90% of what is left of our native woods is concentrated in that
part of the country.
Fortunately, with the changes in forestry policy they have a good
chance of survival and regeneration to increase their scope.
Tucked away in an office in the Perthshire town of Aberfeldy is the
headquarters of the only national organisation in Scotland dedicated to
native woods. The sole clue to its existence is the wooden sign outside
Kenmore Street, bearing the logo of a tree cupped in a pair of caring
hands, surrounded by the title.
Scottish Native Woods, run entirely on charitable funding, was founded
seven years ago by its director, Alan Drever. Working as a countryside
ranger in Aberdeenshire, Drever started the Buchan Countryside Group in
1982, and out of that saw a need for a Scotland-wide organisation
specialising in native woodland conservation and restoration.
So Scottish Native Woods came into being, and since then, like the
trees it wants to see spreading, has grown in strength. There are four
area initiatives in place, covering the West Highlands, North Highlands,
Highland Perthshire and the central lowlands -- West Fife, Clackmannan,
Falkirk district and lowland Stirlingshire.
A fifth -- taking the organisation back to its inspirational roots --
is soon to come into being for Highland Aberdeenshire, covering Deeside
and Strathdon. SNW will then have spread its branches into all the key
native woodland areas in the Highlands.
''There's a lot of scope for expanding what we have left,'' says
Drever, a fearsome, dark-bearded character on first acquaintance, who
vigorously promotes his cause with the fervour of a religious zealot.
What happens is this: each initiative has a project manager, a
woodland specialist whose aim is to identify, restore, and expand
remnants of native woodland through natural regeneration. That means
self-seeding of the species concerned rather than planting. Areas are
fenced off to prevent animals -- deer and sheep -- from eating young
saplings.
The process also involves the eradication of ''exotic'' species like
rhododendron, sycamore, and beech which are highly invasive and will
propagate themselves at the expense of all else.
Necessary though this is, it can cause controversy, as central
lowlands project manager Chris Perkins recently discovered when a stand
of mature beech trees along the edge of a Clackmannanshire wood was
felled. An elderly local resident who was fond of the trees, objected
strongly to what he saw as tantamount to an act of vandalism.
Assurances from Perkins that the felling was carried out with the best
of intentions and on sound environmental grounds, failed to convince
pensioner James Horne that it was the right policy. ''I have watched
these trees for 50 years and I have never ceased to admire them in all
seasons. I was just about in tears when I saw them coming down.''
Operating in the area he does, Perkins has probably the most difficult
job of all SNW's project managers. In the Highlands, where there are
much larger areas of woodland on estates, the organisation's task is
less problematic.
SNW's strategy is both proactive and reactive, explains Drever.
Woodland owners with native species on their land are approached and
encouraged to allow natural regeneration. On the other hand, SNW will
readily respond to an owner's request for assistance.
In either case, the service offered by SNW is free. This involves the
production of management plans, preparing and submitting grant
applications, overseeing contractors and on-going monitoring.
Much progress has been made in the four areas where initiatives are
already established, and the restoration and expansion of more than 7000
acres of native woodland is underway, in co-operation with 70 owners.
One success story is a project on the Cluny Estate near Newtonmore.
Estate partner Roy Tylden-Wright explained: ''Our involvement with
Scottish Native Woods came about as a result of us wanting to regenerate
some old woods that had no significant economic value, but were a
feature of the landscape.''
Apart from the benefits the regenerated woodland will have for game on
the estate -- black grouse for example, a declining game bird, likes the
edge of birch woods -- Tylden-Wright has a use for the timber: he makes
furniture based on traditional designs.
The raw material in this case is Scots pine. ''What appalled me was
that I couldn't get enough locally grown timber to make half a dozen
chairs,'' he said, and he has nothing but praise for SNW. ''They have
provided me with a very good service. The whole project is grounded in
economic and land management reality.''
Tylden-Wright's use of native timber to produce furniture illustrates
the sort of niche market application that Alan Drever stresses as one of
the practical benefits of engaging in regeneration. Other uses include
flooring, wall panelling and display boards, as well as furniture for
the open air, like picnic tables and benches, and charcoal production
for home barbecues.
''There's no doubt about the quality and versatility of the timber,''
says Drever, but stresses that it will be 40 years before markets of any
scale can be developed. ''We are talking about the next generation of
trees,'' he says. Continuity of supply is a major obstacle to the rapid
expansion of commercial uses.
Aside from niche market economic spin-offs, native trees are of great
value aesthetically and environmentally. ''They contribute tremendously
to the landscape value of the Highlands,'' says Drever.
As part of the food chain, birds like the redstart, an African
migrant, eat caterpillars and insects on the trees and in turn are
preyed on by raptors such as the sparrowhawk. On the forest floor, fungi
recycle the nutrients of decaying leaves and dead leaves into the soil.
Mosses, lichens and liverworts also grow on the trees.
Alongside rivers and burns, native trees help to stabilise banks and
prevent erosion. Again, caterpillars fall into the water and are eaten
by fish, which in turn are caught for sport. In the autumn, the leaves
of deciduous trees ending up in the water are fed on by invertebrates
like the fresh water shrimp, which is eaten by fish.
Native trees are valuable to farmers as shelter for cattle and sheep.
Cattle, explains Drever, can help to propogate a wood by breaking up the
ground with their feet, giving seeds a better chance to germinate. Sheep
numbers, of course, need to be controlled so their presence does not
prevent regeneration.
Then there are the recreational benefits. Walkers hate hillsides
swathed in impenetrable blocks of sitka spruce. Native woodlands are not
only good to look at, they offer more pleasant walking conditions and
therefore indirectly benefit tourism and local economies.
With attempts to expand the tourist season into the autumn, Drever
believes there is scope for copying the strategy in American states like
New England, where regular bulletins are issued about where to see the
best colours in the autumn.
One of the best ways of securing a future for native woodlands is to
educate the next generation about the benefits. So SNW has established a
Growing Up With Trees project, in conjunction with rural primary
schools.
Children collect seeds and establish mini-tree nurseries in the
school. Saplings are planted either in the bounds of the school itself
or on land nearby, and the children literally grow up with the trees.
Growing trees is a long-term process. Mistakes made in the past, when
native trees were seen as weeds, in the way of the relentless march of
the sitka spruce, have been acknowledged. It will be some time yet
before the benefits of the change of heart and of policy can be seen on
the ground -- but it's coming.
And with people like Alan Drever around, the cause is secured.

Honey-coloured stone buildings, meadows and sunshine - Jim C Wilson
believes the Haut Languedoc is a land of treasures.
HAVING enjoyed several holidays in the Dordogne, we felt it was time
to visit somewhere quieter, and perhaps hotter. So we headed south,
although not as far as much-publicised Provence. We settled for
Languedoc, which is next door to Provence, but less touristy and less
expensive.
We rented a house for three summer weeks from the Vacances en Campagne
organisation. This was the fifth occasion we had booked with this
company, and we have always found the properties to be of a high
standard, and beautifully situated. The house we chose this year is
called La Griotte (meaning morello cherry) and is aptly situated in a
cherry orchard, just outside the medieval village of Olargues.
The owner welcomed us with wine and the biggest bowl of cherries we'd
ever seen. After that, we were left in total peace, apart from the
shrieks of owls and the rustling of mysterious beasts which snuffed
around the garden at first light.
Olargues is in what is called Haut Languedoc, and lies on the River
Jaur at the foot of the Espinouse mountains. This meant we had a wide
choice of ways to spend our time. We even had a choice of climates. If
we journeyed south or east along the valley of the River Orb or Jaur, we
had temperatures in the nineties and a landscape of rolling vineyards or
garrigue, the dense green covering of holm oak, broom, scrub, and
fragrant herbs. If we felt like some relief from the Mediterranean heat,
a 30-minute drive and some hairpin bends took us up to 3000 feet where
cows and sheep grazed in meadows, and woodland paths were lined with
wild flowers.
Olargues itself is a delight to wander in. It is a tangle of steps,
passageways, and cobbled alleys, dominated by an eleventh-century tower.
The honey-coloured stone of the buildings appears to soak up the
sunshine. We loved to stand on the arched Pont du Diable (the village's
twelfth-century bridge) with swallows and swifts wheeling overhead, and
the big trout basking in the green waters below.
Other villages we particularly enjoyed exploring were the
half-deserted Ceps on the River Orb (with swimming possible under the
bridge), and the fortified Boussagues, once the home of
Toulouse-Lautrec.
If you want a little more bustle, follow the valley of the Jaur for
about 18 kilometres to the west and you will arrive at the small
workaday town of St Pons, where there is a market on Wednesdays. As well
as the usual stalls selling vegetables, and every part of every animal
that the French seem able to devour, there were tables displaying about
25 different kinds of olive, and others specialising in goat's and
sheep's cheeses.
A popular excursion for visitors to Languedoc is to Roquefort, where
the famous ewes' cheese is produced in the Cambalou caves. Shopping can
also be done at the spa town of Lamalou-les-Bains, where it is possible
to ''refresh'' yourself with some warm brackish water from a well in the
grounds of the casino. Both Alphonse Daudet and Andre Gide visited the
town for cures.
A day-trip to the coast is possible from Olargues but, in our past
experience, not worth the trouble, especially in mid-summer. Better by
far to follow the valley of the Orb south to the village of Roquebrun;
there you can swim, fish, or just splash about to cool off. A system of
weirs has produced a sizeable pool, as well as sparkling rapids.
Old mills and allotments line the banks, and the village clings to the
steep hillside beyond. Your only worry is the horseflies!
Roquebrun produces one of the best Saint Chinian wines, and has a
small but dramatically situated botanical gardens with spectacular views
of the Orb valley and beyond.
Canoeing is gaining in popularity in the area, and some of the lakes
in the Espinouse mountains are suitable for windsurfing and small
yachts. Our favourite lake is about a 50-minute drive from Olargues. The
water is cool and very clear, and encircled by forests and mountains.
There is even a sandy beach. The lake was created artificially to
produce hydro-electricity. A 10-minute walk past the dam takes you to
the Saut (or leap) de Vesoles. In pre-dam times there was a waterfall
which cascaded some 650 feet down the mountainside.
The whole area is great for walking. Even in the intense July heat we
couldn't resist striding (or rather puffing) up the Gorges d'Heric. A
steep path crosses and re-crosses the river, and there are countless
rock pools suitable for bathing. After about an hour and a half, the
tiny hamlet of Heric is reached. One family lives there, and thankfully
their enterprise stretches to the sale of cold drinks in an old shaded
garden.
The Caroux mountains lie just to the east of the Espinouse. (The word
Caroux is related to the Gaelic carraig, meaning rock.) Mont Caroux
(3412ft) can be reached after leaving the hamlet of Douch with its stone
roofs, and scrambling up through brooms and over boulders for about an
hour. When we reached the top, the sky was grey and a cold wind tugged
at our shirts. On a clear day it is possible to see across the plains to
the Pyrenees, and to the Mediterranean, some 65 kilometres away.
For many people, food plays a very important part in a French holiday.
Languedoc may not have the culinary reputation of Paris, Provence, or
the Dordogne, but there are many delicious specialities. As well as the
world-famous Roquefort, the best-known dishes are probably cassoulet and
bouillabaisse. The enclosed saltwater etangs at Sete provide the region
with first-class seafood, and the rivers are brimming with trout. Every
restaurant we visited had trout on offer. Sweet chestnuts can be
collected in abundance in the autumn, and feature in many recipes,
particularly in inland areas.
Our favourite restaurant was the Hotel de la Paix in Saint Chinian.
Here you can eat four big courses with wine, served in the garden for
just more than #6 a head! You can then stack the boot with delicious
medal-winning Saint Chinian wines; one of the best comes from nearby
Berlou.
Wine quaffers should also take a trip to the pretty village of
Minerve, centre for the Minervois wines which are now so widely
available throughout the UK.
With the temperature regularly in the nineties, we tended just to
enjoy the rivers, countryside and garden. Spring or autumn is probably
better for drives to Beziers, Sete, or Carcassonne. It was enough to
crumble some thyme over the locally produced pork as it slowly
smouldered on the barbecue. The surrounding orchard offered a choice of
three types of cherry, and there were wild strawberries in the garden.
We sipped ice-cold kir as the sun disappeared beyond the Espinouse. For
our more energetic moments, we improvised a badminton court in the front
garden.
It seemed to us then, as it does now, the best way to live.

Many of the art students studied part-time, some of them having gone
into the factories at the age of 11
WHEN the ''wally closes'' that still decorate many parts of Glasgow
were being built, the city must have been among the best customers for
the firms of tile-makers that clustered around Ironbridge in Shropshire.
Fashion moved on, however. Wally closes lost their popular appeal
though the ones that survive give a good idea of the stunning visual
impact of the colourful tiles with which they were decorated. Today, at
Ironbridge, tiles are still being made but with nothing like the same
self-confident flourish, though there has been a growing awareness of
the artistic value of glazed tiles and good examples of old ones are
selling for high prices in salerooms and antique shops all over the
country.
Admirers of the ''wally close'' and the decorated tile will be
interested to know that just outside Ironbridge, on the other side of
the river from Coalport, an old tileworks has been turned into the
Jackfield Tile Museum. To go round it is to be entranced by the artistry
and unending ingenuity of the Victorians. No tiles that have been
designed since can match theirs for imagination or panache.
From the end of the 1870s until the eve of the Second World War,
Jackfield was the world centre of tile-making and employed the most
skilled designers and craftsmen and women making tiles by the million
from the clay deposits of the Severn valley.
There were several factories huddled together in the narrow Ironbridge
valley -- the Craven Dunnill Tile Works (which presently sites the
Jackfield Museum), and Maw &amp; Co being the largest employers.
Maw &amp; Co's operation was so large at its height that it employed more
than 400 people and turned out 20 million tiles a year. Craven Dunnill,
though a large factory, employed only 95 people but they were extremely
productive and supplied tiles to customers all over the world. It was
Craven Dunnill tiles that were chosen to decorate Palace Chambers, the
government offices opposite the House of Commons.
The tile-makers flourished best at a time when people started becoming
interested in making their surroundings cleaner and more hygienic.
Tiles, which could be washed down, were the perfect floor and wall
coverings for public buildings, public lavatories, hospital wards and
corridors, street signs, dairies, butcher shops and any business where
food was sold. It was not enough to be hygienic, however; the tiles also
had to be eye-catching and colourful. A whole new opportunity for
artists was opened up.
Customers flocked to Ironbridge from all over the world. Maw's won the
contract to floor the Arts and Industries Building in Washington, USA,
in 1877, and by the turn of the century they had provided decorative
tiles for the marriage chamber of the palace of the Maharajah of Mysore;
not to mention the tiles for Bombay's Victoria Station; Chicago's
Wellington Hotel; and the lunatic asylum of Buenos Aires. The list of
buildings decorated with tiles from Ironbridge seems endless -- hotels
in places as far away as South Africa and Singapore, many hospitals
including Charing Cross, King Edward VII's and the Portsmouth Royal
Infirmary; Turkish baths up and down the country including the one still
in existence at Old Broad Street, London; churches including Edinburgh's
cathedral; public houses too numerous to mention, shops by the thousand
and, of course, wally closes.
The demand for decorated tiles was so huge that a School of Art was
opened in Coalbrookdale and its honours roll, as well as examples of the
work of some of its students, are on exhibition at Jackfield. Many of
those students studied part-time, some of them having gone into the
factories at the age of 11. Standards at the school were extremely high
because the tile-making companies aimed to train up their own in-house
artists. Some of the most stunning tiles on show at Jackfield are the
work of men and women who would not otherwise have had any opportunity
to exercise their artistic gifts.
John Bradburn, who designed many beautiful tiles, was a local boy who
started as an apprentice at 11 and went on to become the manager of
Maw's Architectural Faience Department in the early years of the
twentieth century. Maw's chief designer, Charles Henry Temple, also came
from an obscure background and in 1893 he designed the company's
impressive trade stand at the World's Fair in Chicago.
As well as local people, some of the best-known artists in the country
worked for the tile-makers. For example, William de Morgan and also
Walter Crane, better known for illustrating children's books, who did
wonderful nursery-rhyme tiles for Maw &amp; Co. He also designed a range of
art pottery in ancient Hellenic style for Maw's and examples of that can
be seen in the museum.
The tile makers had a wonderful instinct for fashion -- during the
Gothic revival they produced medieval-style encaustic tiles for church
floors; when Persian art took the popular fancy, Persian tiles,
particularly those designed by William de Morgan, flooded the market;
when all things Japanese started to appeal to popular taste, tiles with
Japanese ladies carrying parasols were turned out in their thousands.
All the time however they were also making standard favourites --
tiles decorated with nursery figures, flowers, birds and animals which
are still infinitely appealing. The variety of designs on display at
Jackfield is literally mind-boggling.
When fashion in architecture and interior design changed, tile-making
slumped and many of the factories, including Maw's, were demolished. In
1983, however, the Craven Dunnill site was bought by the Ironbridge
Gorge Museum and efforts were made to collect again examples of the work
done by local factories in their heyday. The tiles from the children's
wards of Charing Cross Hospital were rescued in the nick of time, as
were those from Palace Chambers, Westminster. Today they are on display
in renovated showrooms which also include offices which look as they
must have done in the early years of this century. Jackfield is a
nostalgic but also artistically exciting place to visit.

Special travel correspondent Katie Wood considers some of the best
offers available, whether you're taking your holiday at home or abroad,
on the beach or on the ski slopes.
A SEDATE break water-colour painting in the Lake District should
appeal to those looking for a few days' peace and quiet. Countrywide
Holidays (tel 1061 224 2855) are offering a week commencing either
August 12 or 19 in Grasmere for just #269 or #289 respectively. This
includes seven night's accommodation, full board in a country guest
house and all tuition. And good news for singles -- for once, there's no
single room supplements!
* EUROSTAR is here at last for Scots. Every Monday-Saturday a Eurostar
link train departs Edinburgh at 8.30am, travelling direct to London
Waterloo to connect with the Paris and Brussels services. These arrive
in the French and Belgian capitals at 6.26pm and 8.46pm respectively.
These services have opened up several short break options -- great for
those who don't like flying -- and now you can enjoy the delights of
Amsterdam, Lille, Disneyland Paris and Bruges, all at a supplement of
just #18 over the London price. Short break operator Travelscene (tel
0181 427 4445) are marketing several well priced breaks using these
services.
* AIR fares to the rest of Europe and to Africa are notoriously
expensive but one flight specialist company based in Glasgow has
currently got some unbeatable deals. PLS Worldwide, 65 Bath Street,
Glasgow (tel 0141 332 3898) have prices such as Dusseldorf #162 return
from Edinburgh/Glasgow, Bordeaux for #218 or Nairobi for #395.
* ARGYLL, Mull and Iona feature in a new guide which has just been
published by John Donald Publishers. It's got to be the most detailed,
definitive work yet on these beautiful areas. So, if you want to gen up
on all the history, culture and background it's all in Willie Orr's book
Discovering Argyll, Mull and Iona, #8.95.
* CARIBTOURS are offering clients booking into the famous five-star
Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados a free dinner per adult per day (worth a
staggering #147). An alternative is to take a free room upgrade to an
Ocean View Room (worth #145). Prices start at #1689, so it's all
relative and still not exactly a cheap holiday, but if you've got a
blowout holiday in mind, it's certainly a fantastic location and a
beautiful hotel. Call Caribtours on 0171 581 3517, or see a travel
agent.
* IF you're stressed out and need a detoxing therapeutic holiday in
the sun, there's a Holistic Centre in Spain called Cortijo Romero.
Located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, it's 20 miles
from the southern coast of Spain, near to the fabulous city of Granada.
You can choose from packages offering personal development, massage,
yoga, dance -- or even a course on ''The Dynamics of Personal
Intimacy''. Alternative stuff, but previous clients say it's heaven on
earth. They sell through an agent in England, so for more info call
Janice Gray on 01494 782720.
* PAGE &amp; MOY have an autumn brochure detailing ''Great Value
Holidays'' such as a week's tour to the Austrian village of Filzmoos for
just #225, or a four-night break to Rome, Florence and Venice for #259
including flights from London, transfers, accommodation on a B &amp; B basis
and the services of a tour leader. Call the company on 0116 252 4444.
* ANYBODY taking an Airtours holiday this summer will be pleased to
know that they now have a dedicated check-in facility at Glasgow Airport
so you won't have to stand in the general queue with people flying to
the same resort. Should save a bit of time when you need it most.
* INGHAMS -- the ski specialists -- have bought over Bladon Lines and
the combined company has just launched its new 95/96 ski programme.
Prices on packages to Switzerland and Austria are 10% down on last year
and several new ski resorts are offered. Scottish departures feature and
there are some good deals around for those able to book early. Brochures
are in travel agents now.
* STILL on a skiing note, Edinburgh-based company Osprey Holidays has
expanded its Ski Independence North America programme and released their
brochure for next season. With 22 resorts and new facilities such as
heli-skiing and snow-cat packages in Whistler, Banff/Lake Louise and
Crested Butte, it's worth getting the brochure. Prices are from #399 for
seven nights at Killington.
* IF you've been one of the hundreds hanging on the engaged line to
the Spanish National Tourist Office in London, wondering how the country
that Brits travel to more than any other can treat their potential
customers in this way, there's good and bad news. The good is that
they've now launched a 24hr consumer hotline (telephone 0891 669920).
The bad is it's yet another instance of a national tourist office
cashing in on a line that actually makes money for them. Calls cost 49p
per minute (39p cheap rate).
* DON'T forget the services of the Scottish Tourist Board if you're
holidaying at home. This year they have a wide-ranging collection of
brochures and leaflets available, covering everything from
''Watersports'' to ''Wild Scotland'' which details all the natural
splendours of the country. This excellent free literature is available
by calling STB on 0131 332 2433.

New car buyers will be queuing up this week to get their hands on the
latest Euro-jelly mould. But in other parts of the country there are
enthusiasts for whom motoring is still a pastime for the freewheeling
individual.. David Finlay ventured into the deepest recesses pf the
Southern Uplands to meet them.
ONE of the appeals of the Southern Uplands village of Leadhills is
that there are no boring roads within miles of it. If you consider a car
as simply a tool for getting from A to B, these routes are probably just
a pain in the neck, but to those of us who treat driving as an art form,
as satisfying in its own way as sketching a landscape or playing the
flute, they give a delightful opportunity to practise smoothness,
control, and observation against a backdrop of swooping hill country.
If that's the way your thoughts are tending as you approach Leadhills,
it's entirely appropriate that once you get there you will soon find
yourself at Tracks, a ''motor nostalgia cafe'' which, like almost every
other institution in the area, advertises itself as Scotland's highest.
Tracks was opened in April 1994 by Carlos and May Nunes, respectively
an expatriate Portuguese rock drummer and a nursery nurse from Newton
Stewart. They met in London, where Carlos was failing to make a
successful career as a musician. At this time Carlos was making ends
meet by painting and working in restaurants. One of these was dedicated
to the theme of American motoring, which was good because Carlos had
always loved cars. He soon discovered he loved Scotland, too, through a
series of visits to May's family. All the justifications were now in
place for Carlos and May to uproot their young family and move north to
establish Tracks.
Why Leadhills, though? ''I ask myself that every morning!'' says
Carlos. ''But I love the countryside, and Leadhills is quite central.
It's only an hour from Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Carlisle. The only
problem is that from the motorway there are no signs to the village --
you have to follow the signs to Abington -- so a lot of people go round
in circles before they find us.''
Tracks has gained enough of a reputation in its first year for a lot
of motoring enthusiasts to make the effort. The Scottish Citroen
Specials Owners' Club dropped in for breakfast during a recent tour, for
example, while this summer the cafe is being used as a base for both a
Ford Anglia 105E Owners Club national event and the second annual
Leadhills Road Run. The latter is organised by Clydesdale Nostalgia Car
Club, an informal outfit which gives life membership -- and details of
all events at Tracks -- in return for a small donation towards costs.
''At the moment we are interested in clubs getting to know the place
and coming for AGMs,'' Carlos explains. ''We organise the catering and
so on, and get bands in to the hall next door. We also organise things
for the kids, like radio-controlled cars, bouncy castles, and
face-painting.''
Since the entire population of Leadhills can hardly be expected to
drop in for three meals a day, this outside custom is vital. ''We do get
more business from outside Leadhills,'' says May, ''but the people who
do support us locally support us really well.''
May also reports that the name has travelled remarkably far, giving as
an example a visit from ''a guy who lives in London who saw our advert
in Custom Car magazine when he was serving in Bosnia!''
It's difficult to miss the motoring theme when an event is taking
place at Tracks -- 30 hot rods parked in the small square outside do
tend to catch the eye. But even when nothing specific is going on there
is plenty for a car fan to enjoy. Carlos doesn't take much persuading to
show you the vehicles he is working on himself -- the alarmingly
customised Ford Anglia, the standard Ford Prefect, and the very far from
standard Morris 8 hot rod with the 2-litre Ford engine and Jaguar rear
axle.
And there's a lot more inside. For a room which can just about cope
with 30 people sitting in it, the cafe has an astonishing amount of
motoring memorabilia, some of it from Carlos's own collection and some
donated by visitors. There are posters, hub caps, number plates from
Portugal, Germany, Brazil, and the USA, watercolours of cars by Carlos
himself, models, and oil-company adverts.
The counter is made up partly of an old axle, and Carlos has plans to
construct a couple of bar stools from old Ford gearboxes, which he
anticipates will cause howls of protest from purists.
The neatest conjunction of motoring and catering, though, concerns the
old traffic-lights which sit in one corner, and which May points out are
the only set in Leadhills (and presumably therefore Scotland's highest).
Carlos saw them advertised in Birmingham and thought they would be ideal
for Tracks. They are usually switched on, but with only red and amber
showing.
Why not green? Well, at present Tracks does not have a table licence,
and there are a couple of things to sort out before alcohol can be
served. He hopes to be serving drinks within a few months though, and
when he does he will switch the lights to green every so often to let
people know that Happy Hour has just started . . .

The Citroen 2CV is a car that some people love, others hate, and still
others can't seem to leave alone. Take Pierre Barbot, for instance. Back
in 1951, he decided to convert a 2CV into something that would be able
to compete in the Bol d'or, a very famous French long-distance race. It
took him quite a while, but eventually he and his Barbot Speciale made
it to the June 1953 event, in which they won their class.
Back then the 2CVs had engines that were half the size of those found
in the later models, and this made them considerably slower than the
ones you see chugging around today. For Barbot to have turned such a
lazybones into a Bol d'or class winner was quite an achievement.
The directors of Yacco, a major French oil company, certainly thought
so. And that's why, three months after the race, the car was involved in
an attempt to break several international speed records for cars with
engines of less than 350cc. Yacco's self-congratulatory adverts,
published shortly afterwards, mentioned only the 12 and 24-hour records,
but in fact there were nine altogether, the most dizzyingly rapid of
them being 200 kilometres at an average speed of just over 57mph.
Barbot's efforts are chronicled in Album 2CV which gave Andrew
Timpson, one of the band of Glasgow 2CV enthusiasts, the idea of
building a sort of ''homage to Barbot''.
'I just went hard at it from the start. I would go to the garage at
10pm and work on the car until two in the morning. The whole thing took
about three months.''
The work on ''Yacco'' was done from Andrew's memory of the pictures
but the basic shape of the two cars remains pretty similar -- which
means that there is no weather protection for Yacco's occupants. At
out-of-town speeds you feel as if you are being pushed face first
through ice cold treacle and if it happens to be raining . . .
Oh, but what fun Yacco is when the weather is right.

EVEN the more experienced onlookers murmur in appreciation as the
bright yellow machine leaps out of the final corner and begins an
astonishing burst of acceleration, accompanied by a scream which echoes
round the circuit. A tiny hiccup signifying a sleight-of-hand
gearchange, another ferocious cry from the exhaust, and the car leaps
across the finish line, then slows down, pulls into the paddock, stops
and is abruptly silent. After a brief undoing of belts, the tall, slim
driver stands up and climbs out.
But when the crash helmet is removed it reveals not some cocksure
young boy racer but a softly-spoken pensioner who brushes off
compliments from passers-by with a list of the mistakes he has just
made. His car is one he built himself in the garage beside his house
near Elgin.
At 65, Jim Sword believes he is the oldest racing driver in Scotland.
He is also easily the most northerly constructor of racing cars in the
UK. His car, Jasag 5, is the eighth in which he has competed, and of
those there was only one for which he was not entirely responsible, from
the drawing board to the start line.
He took early retirement in 1987, partly to spend more time building
cars and partly because his job as a draughtsman with Scottish Malt
Distillers no longer held the same appeal as it had years before.
His first attempt to to construct a racing car was back in 1965. He
had already competed on motorbikes, and was persuaded to switch to four
wheels when he went to a car meeting and saw a series of tiny Cooper
single-seaters which used motorbike engines.
''I thought they'd be very easy to build and started designing one of
my own. I wasn't going to buy a car, because I couldn't afford to for a
start, and I really like building thing -- the technical side really
appeals.''
That first car, Dagger, after his own schoolboy nickname, was
''terribly basic, but it was something to get me going''. It was
followed a few years later by the slightly more sophisticated Jasnes, a
combination of his own name, James, and his wife's, Agnes.
The first syllable came into play again in the early 1970s with the
first of the Jasag series. This was Jim's earliest attempt at a
full-size racer, using a Lotus engine. His son Graham began sharing
Jasag 1 as soon as he was old enough to get a driving licence, and it
was with a view to helping Graham's motorsport career that Jim
eventually sold the car and -- for the one and only time -- went out and
bought a Mallock sports car.
Up until now Jim had always competed in the closely related sports of
sprinting and hillclimbing, in which you drive on your own against the
clock. With the Mallock the Swords tackled circuit racing, which was
''massively more exciting. Graham really took to the Mallock, but I
didn't like it. I felt it was such a fragile thing, and I felt I could
build something better.''
His next effort, the Jasag 2 sports car, was ''a disaster -- I just
chopped it up because I was so disillusioned with it''. But Jasag 3
showed a lot of promise. It was soon sold, though, because Graham had
emigrated to Austria and Jim ''felt I was too old and slow to go circuit
racing. So I built another single-seater and went hillclimbing again.''
The fourth Jasag saw a return to the idea of using motorbike engines.
This is a popular ploy because the Japanese units in particular produce
a lot of power in standard form, and you can buy one complete with a
six-speed gearbox for as little as #1000.
Jim used an 1100cc Suzuki engine in Jasag 4, and it soon became clear
that this was one of his finest creations yet.
He said at the time that it would be his last, but he picked up so
many ideas while competing with it that an updated model simply had to
follow. Sure enough, in late 1993 the dramatic-looking Jasag 5 made its
first appearance.
There's a Suzuki engine again, but this time a modified 1300cc version
which gives the very light car quite remarkable performance. Although
Jim reckons that in a couple of respects it is not yet quite as good as
Jasag 4, it has been his most successful car, with several class wins
and records, some of them at the hands of Graham on his occasional
visits back home.
Jasag 5 also recently gave Jim his first ever outright victory at the
new Boyndie sprint course near Banff, after a day-long battle with Bill
McDonald. It is absolutely characteristic of Jim that he is the first to
say how well McDonald was driving, and  to put his own success down to
the extra straight-line speed of Jasag.

GEOFFREY WINTHROP YOUNG
Alan Hankinson
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #18.99
I BEGAN this biography with a feeling of irritation. Here, I thought,
was another of these English upper class men, born into privilege,
educated at a famous public school and at Cambridge, confident in
society, excelling in sports.
But Geoffrey Winthrop Young was much more. He was a mountaineer of
exceptional courage and skill, combining his love of heights with a
literary gift.
Young was a compulsive Alpinist, and his account in his book On High
Hills of the first ascent of the tremendous South Face of the Taschhorn
conveys vividly the terror and determination, then the detachment, of
men literally clinging to life.
''Something of the same feeling of separation between the body and the
watching mind is the experience of men actually falling or drowning,
when action is at an end and there is not even pain to reunite bodily
and mental sensation.''
By profession Geoffrey Young was an inspector of schools, approaching
his task with the same flair as he approached the snowy peaks. When the
First World War broke out he showed the qualities of the Renaissance Man
by becoming a war correspondent read by millions, and then the
administrator of an ambulance unit which brought unquantifiable comfort
to the maimed in the rubble of Ypres. But battles were like peaks to a
man of Young's stamina: he moved on to another frontier, the war in
Italy, where the revered climber lost a leg.
It didn't keep him off the mountains. He had a ''polite leg'' for work
and society, and a climbing leg which he designed himself and which had
a selection of interchangeable feet according to the rock conditions.
Young helped the refugee Kurt Hahn to establish Gordonstoun, and was
also closely involved in the attempts by German liberals in the 1930s to
get rid of Hitler.
In a deeply affecting biography, one of the most poignant passages is
about the loss of his protege George Mallory on Everest in June 1924.
Did Mallory reach the highest point of land on earth? Geoffrey Winthrop
Young, poet, mountaineer, educationist, certainly reached the clear high
heights of life.

TO SAY Dougal Drysdale is flash might not be entirely accurate, but
the Edinburgh academic does play with fire, quite literally, in the
interests of saving lives.
Dougal is a reader in fire safety engineering at the University of
Edinburgh where he teaches civil engineering. He's an expert on fires,
and how they spread. His research, along with team-mate Alan Beard in
collaboration with mathematical models produced by academics of
University College, London, could help make buildings safer from fire.
Dougal has been specialising in flashovers, best described as a fire
that suddenly flares into a raging inferno. If you've ever seen Kurt
Russell as the hero fire-fighter battling the flames in Backdraft,
you'll get a rough picture of what a flashover looks like.
For an even more graphic description, the Bradford City stadium fire a
decade ago was a flashover fire where a small fire suddenly raced out of
control so quickly that escape was almost impossible. A few years before
that, the Dublin Disco disaster was another example where flames spread
so rapidly that the heat and fumes killed many teenagers almost before
they were aware of what was happening. In flashovers like these, the
human cost can be enormous.
Dougal's work is helping to show how this kind of sudden flashover
fire occurs, and their knowledge should be able to lead the way to
preventing them.
The Edinburgh specialist says his main interest is the growth or
spread of fires. Some fires, especially those in open spaces, are
actually simple to predict mathematically. But inside buildings, due to
a huge number of factors, predictions as to how flames will spread and
how quickly, are much more difficult.
Dougal says: ''Our objective is to provide mathematical models of the
dynamics of fires that will enable architects to design buildings that
are virtually proof against flashover fires. Our ultimate aim is to make
buildings safer.
Flashovers often occur when a fire heats up furniture and floor
coverings and releases smoke and inflammable gases which rise to ceiling
height. As the fire burns, the heat can cause these gases to ignite and
the resultant flare scorches everything else in the room, sending
temperatures soaring to ferocious levels in seconds.
To help prevent such tragedies as the Dublin catastrophe and the
Bradford City horror, Dougal and his opposite numbers in London use a
computer to work out the complex maths necessary to predict fire-flow in
a method known as Computational Fluid Dynamics. Their research
theoretically divides a burning room into three levels: a high level
where smoke gathers, a fire base, and an intermediate cooler area. Using
the mathematical model and changing the factors like the size of the
fire and the room and depths of the various layers, they have been able
to predict how a flashover comes to explosive life.
Dougal says: ''We have been doing research in relation to the Kings
Cross fire where the mechanism of rapid spread is not clearly
understood.
''In flashovers, we have studied the dynamics involved in the rapid
build up of heat in enclosed spaces. We wanted to identify the size of
fire necessary to produce flashover in a given area.
''For a particular room and space, we can determine the maximum burn
rate which could be tolerated without giving rise to a flashover and
this could be one way of identifying the type of furnishings which
should be permitted in a given space. In recent years there has been a
lot of work in making upholstered furniture safer. If furniture has a
lower burn rate, then flash fires can be delayed.
''In buildings of high occupancy, offices, airports and the like, the
choice of materials for furnishings and the arrangement of space between
them can control fire rates according to the rules produced by the
mathematical model. The main danger in public buildings lies in the fact
that a fire could start in a small area of the building, and when the
flashover occurs huge amounts of smoke and fumes could affect the other
areas where people are gathered.''
The research involved 30 model rooms in the Edinburgh fire safety unit
where the experimenters were able to control ventilation and fuel. To
get the results, they naturally had to set every room alight, and using
video cameras the fire spread could be monitored accurately. They found
that the mathematical models predicted which fires would produce
flashover flares.
Returning to heroic Kurt Russell in the movie, a backdraught fire is
similar in effect to a flashover, but this equally terrifying phenomenon
happens when a fire uses up the available air and dies down, unable to
continue because all atmospheric fires need oxygen as fuel. The
smouldering heat, however, continues to release highly flammable gases
into the room. As soon as the room is ventilated, by an opened door or
window, the rush of oxygen ignites the gases in a virtual explosion
which can be hot enough to set fire to everything else and even cause a
flashover fire.
A backdraught fire may have been responsible for the deaths of more
than a dozen fire-fighters battling a warehouse blaze in Glasgow's
Cheapside Street in the sixties.
Back in Edinburgh, it's comforting to know that the researchers
setting rooms alight could be helping to make buildings safer.

A DOCTOR'S line could take on a new meaning altogether, thanks to a
new system being tried out in a collaboration between British Telecom
and IBM.
For patients could really become outpatients . . . by getting a
long-distance diagnosis down the telephone line. People with a variety
of conditions, including heart patients or pregnant women, will be able
to get a consultant's opinion without the expert having to get healing
hands-on experience.
The system, pioneered by the Institute of Health Infomatics and funded
by Telecom and the Big Blue, is being tried out in Wales and will likely
get a Scottish run soon. The remote diagnosis uses videophones, and has
already shown remarkably successful results.
A number of GPs and about 60,000 patients are taking part in the
trials in which a commercial videophone card and mini camera are
attached to each surgery's personal computer. A hi-resolution camcorder
is also available if the consultant needs clearer images.
Instead of travelling long distances for a consultation, the patient
visits the GP who operates the videophone and camcorder as requested by
the specialist. Down the line, he is able to see the pictures on screen
and make a diagnosis. In the trial, the remote diagnosis was backed up
by personal checks and the consultants discovered they were correct in
every case but two which they couldn't diagnose at all, even in the
face-to face meeting.
The physicians believe the potential benefits are huge, including huge
cuts in waiting times for consultations for some conditions.
The new system is expected to cost about #2000 for the videophone and
#900 for the camcorder. The system could link to the computers most GPs
already have in their practices on an ISDN telephone line.

* THE world's first card-run miniature video camera for use with a
laptop is a tiny Scots development with a big world-wide future.
The PC card camera, made by Edinburgh company V V L, is palm-sized,
takes digital images and links to a laptop which shows real-time motion
video. The mono-image is captured and stored on the computer's hard disk
and images can be viewed immediately via the software or imported
straight into word processing or database.
V V L say the sub-miniature video camera dispenses with waiting times
for development, running out of film, messy chemicals or fading images.
PC Camera users can point, click, store and analyse the images as soon
as they are taken.
Automatic and manual exposure controls allow it to be used in a wide
range of conditions, and the power consumption is said to be so miserly
it can be operated from the computer's battery supply. It can be fitted
with any industry standard lens including wide and narrow angles, zoom
and macro.

* FIRST Encounters is the third game in the ELITE series which has
been released a decade after the first. The other two games in the
trilogy are Elite which started it all off, and Frontier which continued
the theme of space trading.
First Encounters is set 50 years on from Frontier, which advanced half
a century on Elite, in a universe that's split between the Empire and
the Federation. The previous game relied mainly on astro-navigation
through space. The new game features a much more structured and better
defined storyline. The Thargoids, bless 'em, shoot and run aliens, it
seems, are the victims of a smear campaign. The player must uncover the
smearers. The object is to earn as much space currency as possible.
The graphics in the games have been beefed up a bit, and texture
mapping is used all over. Although you need to have quite a fast machine
to play it on, it went at a reasonable speed on a DX2/66. Every aspect
of the game has been redesigned, the ship's interior doesn't look just
as plain, and a lot of the ships have been slightly modified and texture
mapping applied. The textures unfortunately vary in quality from good to
pretty bad. On the PC CD-ROM version, there are video sequences using 35
digitised actors, and various other fancy features.
It's a very absorbing game, which can go on for hour after hypnotic
hour, but it can take a while to get into. If you want it to run at a
fair speed, turn off the texture mapping. Minimum requirements, 486
DX40, 8 meg of both ram and hard drive space.

* THE object of new technology, it seems, is to make it ever smaller.
Printers used to be room-sized machines with ink and rollers and
dangerous moving parts. They needed years of training to operate.
Now look at this. In the department of how small can things actually
get and still work, this looks like the ultimate. No doubt somebody will
prove us wrong, but at the moment, the makers, Citizen Systems, claim
it's the world's smallest portable laser quality printer.
A pocket-sized printer. Whatever will they think of next? It weighs
just over a pound, prints by thermal transfer and is 25.4 centimetres
long, or a mere ten inches, the width of a sheet of A4.
Designed to benefit business people who like to print on the move, and
built specifically for use with a laptop or the very latest palmtop
computers, the Citizen PN60 is billed as the smallest and lightest on
the market. It prints on virtually any type of office stationery from
paper to labels with no special adaptation. It even has optional colour
printing for highlighting and has a fine 360dpi resolution.
Batteries are included in the retail price of #349 plus vat.

* A BREAKTHROUGH advance in cooling system design promises to cut
costs, protect the environment and open up a new field of portable
cooling systems.
Designed by scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
the new system uses low power, exhibits very low vibration and is small
and portable. The system was developed with help from industry for use
in a portable, fieldable radiation detectio n system; however, it
promises to have application in a range of other commercial and
industrial uses.
Key to the new system is a unique method for reducing the vibration
produced by the system's motorised compressor. The Lab design uses
microprocessors to measure vibration and produce a counterforce that
cancels most of the movement. With less vibration, the compressor motor
becomes more efficient, uses less energy and lasts longer.
* FARM crop wastes can be made into granules that remove toxic metals
from industrial wastewater, a U S Department of Agriculture scientist
has found.
Water-cleaning granules -- similar to the ones that filter water in
fish tanks -- can be formed from ground hulls of soya bean, cottonseeds
and rice and can clean almost 100 percent of all copper and nickel from
waste water, better than any commercial filter known, and it's a cheap
and renewable source.
* US researchers have created a powerful new computer program, called
LINUS (Local, Independently Nucleated Units of Structure), that appears
to quickly predict the three-dimensional shapes of large protein
fragments.
All life is based on proteins, and the shapes of proteins strongly
affect what they do. If further testing and development confirm LINUS's
abilities, it could provide important assistance to medical research in
fields ranging from drug design to genetic engineering.
* A GENETICALLY engineered canarypox virus will be tested as a
potential AIDS vaccine by researchers at Johns Hopkins, the major
American university research centre. The virus, made from a vaccine used
in France to inoculate canaries, has been modified to carry genes that
produce three proteins found in HIV.
Hopkins investigators are recruiting volunteers for the study, which
will test the safety of the vaccine and its ability to stimulate the
immune system. In previous tests the virus was found to be safe and to
stimulate the immune system to produce antibo dies against the HIV in
adults. It also stimulated the immune system of some volunteers to make
antibodies which can kill cells infected with HIV and represents an
important weapon in the immune system's fight against viruses. Each
volunteer will receive between three and five injections of either the
canary vaccine or an experimental rabies vaccine during the two-year
study.
In another virus experiment, a preliminary research study sponsored by
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggests that
a new genetically engineered influenza vaccine can protect people from
the flu, with fewer of the minor side effects associated with currently
used flu vaccines.
The new vaccine contains a purified version of a protein called
hemagglutinin, normally found on the surface of the Influenza-A virus.
The vaccine is produced in cells derived from moths, unlike the current
flu vaccines, which are produced in chicken eggs. No doubt the yanks
will call it a Moth-Flu-Killer.

Actor, playwright and comedian Tony Roper tells ANN DONALD what sends
him off to sleep at night.
* I'VE got about four on the go just now that I dip in and out of. The
first one is I Claudius by Robert Graves. I watched the TV series and
loved that. Then I purchased the tapes from the BBC and loved them. Then
I was floating about London with two hours to kill so I headed for a wee
second hand bookshop and saw this. So I'm enjoying it all over again
just because I'm so attracted to that period in history.
Another one that I'm re-reading is The Mask Of Apollo by Mary Renault.
She deals mostly with Ancient Greece and the surrounding Islands. This
is about a classical Greek actor called Nikeratos and she winds in his
life story with the history of that era. It's the old thing of taking an
interesting character and setting it in a historically interesting time.
She does that better than anyone I know.
The modern stuff I'm reading is a book by Paul Davies called Are We
Alone? -- Implications Of The Discovery Of Extra Terrestial Life.
Basically he's asking -- is there something out there or not? It's a bit
more science orientated than say Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World.
From what I can gather so far he doubts whether there is anyone out
there because you'd have thought they would have reached us by now. It's
a reasonably technical book but for me. It's what I imagine the
twenty-first century is going to be about -- which is exploring what
we're all about as human beings. Philosophers have always done that but
I think we'll all be doing it scientifically in the future and that's
what interests me.
The one book that I love dipping in and out of just for fun is The
Bumper Book Of Insults edited by Nancy McPhee. Every time I get really
annoyed with someone I look this up and I think ''I wish I had said
that!'' One of my favourites is a criticism of a two line poem which
goes -- ''Very nice. Though there were dull stretches.''
I tend to be the sort of person who re-reads books over and over again
but I find as I get older that I tend to drop more books than I ever
finish.

JAMES McNEILL WHISTLER: Drawings, pastels and watercolours.
Margerat F MacDonald, Yale University Press.
* THIS book is a complete joy for Whistler fans. It's big, heavy,
expensive, and, as you would expect, comprehensive -- but also
intriguing, entertaining, and amazingly easy to read. Scholarship has a
habit of being heavy and pompous. Margaret MacDonald has managed the
impossible, skipping through history, chronology, literature, anecdote,
medium, provenance, and authentication with a light touch. Her 30 years
of scholarship, latterly as research fellow at Glasgow University's
Centre for Whistler Studies, is not thrust down our throats undigested,
as too many arrogant academics mistakenly do, but delivered with humour
and a straightforward voice.
The book contains more than 1700 entries and 1800 images, many never
exhibited or published. They vividly demonstrate the wide range of
Whistler's art, ranging from his first childhood sketches made in
schoolbooks in 1843 when he was nine, right up to drawings from 1901 of
Algiers and Corsica found in his studio on his death in 1903.
What Whister, that most pungent of critics would say about it, one can
only surmise but I believe even he would be pleased.

THE BOOK OF SECRETS
M G Vassanji
Macmillan, #14.99
IT IS the gift of Indian writers to render an audience as inert and
receptive as if Puck had flung the magic dust or Barbara Woodhouse
breathed up their nostrils. A quality that the Rushdies and Kureishis
manipulate for effect, but which quieter chroniclers simply employ.
Writers such as Vikram Seth, Rohinton Mistry, Amit Chaudhuri, and now M
G Vassanji, first winner of Canada's Booker equivalent, the Giller
Prize, whose jury included Alice Munro and Mordecai Richler.
The jury citation explains simply the charm and concealed complexity
of this book: ''Part generational history, part detective story, part
social chronicle, the novel is a living tapestry to join past to
present, a continuing commentary on the act of story-telling which is
being dramatised as we read''.
Briefly, a young English District Commissioner takes up his first post
in a developing town in the Kenyan (British East African) interior close
to the border with Tanganyika (German East Africa). The year is 1913.
The town, sprung from an impulsive settlement by an Indian Shamsi
trader and his Swahili bride, is still finding its character and
allegiances. As war looms in Europe, the ADC's impressions are recorded
each day in his diary, an object of awe to the illiterate people,
possibly a device for stealing their souls. Presently, one of them
steals the diary.
Years later it is passed to Pius Fernandez, an immigrant Shamsi from
Goa, just retired from teaching English in Dar Es Salaam. He retraces
the history of the diary and its characters in a story which is partly a
portrait of communities in exile, partly an interplay of belief,
superstition, impression, record, and the power of the written word.
From those same bizarre Great War skirmishes between British and
German East Africa that were the subject of William Boyd's An Icecream
War -- exotic double agents and spymasters haunt the jungle, among them
an albino scout, Fumfratti, and a ruthless Englishman known as The Hyena
-- the story shifts by way of Julius Nyerere's independence movement to
conclude in 1988.
Unlike western -- or eastern -- dynastic novels there is a constant
global tilt that is founded in the condition of exile, a generational
wariness of power play, and a readiness to pack up and go.
Of the historians and witnesses the teacher Fernandez turns to in his
search for the truth, many are his own former pupils, now dispersed into
academic or economic exile around the world. In this way the threads of
the tapestry are reintegrated into a work which appears throughout as
vivid personal history.
Only as it nears completion does the overview makes itself felt.
Certain blurred impressionistic elements such as the beautiful,
mystical, murdered Mariamu, presumed diary thief, escape beyond our
reach and so achieve lasting importance. Her bereaved bridegroom, Pipa,
survives to become a fat remarried grocer in Dar Es Salaam, and builds a
secret Shrine for both the diary and his dead wife's increasingly
powerful presence.
While the fleeting, smiling, slightly sinister figure known as The
Teacher, who stops at his store one day, later emerges as Nyerere
himself, whose real history and influence render him finite and
ultimately less powerful.
This is an enchanting book, written with wisdom and vision in a prose
style that never draws attention to itself. Vassanji, whose own
background is in Kenya and Tanzania before Canada, writes with equal
authority in each of his voices, from the English administrator to the
docile over-respectful Goan teacher.
If any further proof were needed of the strength of the exile
experience in modern English language fiction this is it.

IT WAS interesting to see that Mercer Ellington had once more taken a
band into the Blue Note in New York in an attempt to recapture the music
of his father Edward Kennedy Ellington.
So far I have heard no reports of the success or otherwise of the
engagement which ran through this month . . . but I would be concerned
for Duke's son who appears to be determined to keep alive his father's
music with an orchestra which would hew closely to the original.
Because, you see, there is no way that Ellington's band could ever be
kept alive.
Sure you can have ghost bands for Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey and
for others too. Incidentally, just to digress, one of the best big bands
I heard was one with a Dorsey label which had a trumpet section which
included Chris Griffin, Pee Wee Erwin, Bernie Privin and Sy Oliver. That
didn't sound anything like a re-creation.
Anyhow, to go back to Duke,I recently bought a double CD which
features the band he brought with him to Glasgow in 1958, the first time
Ellington had been to Britain with his full orchestra since the
thirties.
It would be wrong to say I had forgotten how glorious the sound was
that night in the Odeon. But it was nice to be reminded of it by a
recording of the personnel who arrived that night in Glasgow.
I mentioned one trumpet section earlier but the Ellington section was
even more severe . . . Cat Anderson, Clark Terry, Ray Nance, Shorty
Baker and Willie Cook. The saxophonists were Russell Procope, Johnny
Hodges, Jimmy Hamilton, Paul Gonsalves and Harry Carney. Trombonist
Quentin Jackson recreated the plunger glories of Tricky Sam Nanton and I
swear I thought I was in heaven . . .
Nostalgia has not deceived me. Nor has memory played tricks.Over the
last few weeks I have listened over and over again to the music which
was made that night in Glasgow and on so many other nights in so many
other places.
Clark Terry playing Perdido. Carney on Sophisticated Lady. Hodges on
Sunny Side of the Street and anything else he cared to play. Ray Nance
on violin and Shorty Baker on trumpet on Mr Gentle and Mr Cool.
And the medley, of course, that medley which was hammered by the
critics, but which Duke always offered up as ''some of the things which
were done before I joined the band'' and which the audiences came to
hear.
After all, what would an Ellington concert have been without Mood
Indigo, or Black and Tan Fantasy or Creole Love Call or any of those
marvellous, utterly Ellingtonian songs?
Which takes me back to the Blue Note and New York and Mercer, still
attempting to escape from the Ducal presence which has always enveloped
him. You cannot re-create Ellington because Ellington wrote for his
individual musicians. Their sounds became his sound.
Once you were in Duke's band you were type-cast. You became an
Ellingtonian. For some musicians that was the one accolade they wanted.
For others they looked for more and found it in other bands -- as Cootie
Williams did with Benny Goodman -- or as soloists as Ben Webster did for
so many years.
Always, though, they seemed to drift back and I recall seeing Cootie
Williams and Lawrence Brown when they returned.  Neither, though, looked
happy, and once back at a friend's house Cat Anderson sat listening to
Louis Armstrong records, the Hot Fives I seem to remember, and I asked
him how Cootie enoyed being back after all those years away.
''I don't know,'' said Cat, as he savoured another Armstrong chorus,
''he doesn't really speak to anyone but Duke.''
Naive as I was I found that hard to understand but I had a friend who
had known Duke since his days in Washington when his father worked at
the British Embassy. And Ian explained things to me about the band and
offered insights and I listened and I believed him because Ian McHardy
was the only man I knew who called Duke ''Eddie'' and he told me that
the individuals who made up that band were unique.
Unique in their musicianship, and unique in their attitudes.
And ''Eddie'' allowed that because he knew that the combination of
their talents and his offered the world a new sound, a distinctive music
which would never be duplicated.
Maybe the Blue Note gig was a success but I doubt it. Without the men
who made the music there will be only disappointment.
The last time I saw Duke in Glasgow the band was falling apart.
Gonsalves's tenor chair was empty and no explanation was offered. Money
Johnson was performing Hello Dolly as a supposed tribute to Louis, and
poor Russell Procope was marching round the stage playing Tiger Rag and
I wondered what had happened to the Ducal magic . . .
But he knew. He played more piano that night than I can ever remember
him doing. He played, for instance, Soda Fountain Rag and while you
recognised the curtain was coming down on an era you realised too that
Ellington was a genius and one who would never be replaced.
Perhaps Mercer has still to come to terms with the fact that this
music, this unforgettable  marvellous music, died with Ellington and the
men who made it.
Only the records will keep it alive.

Dundee, as William Hunter reports, will soon recognise its dream for a
textile museum and restitch jute back into the town's life
Sometimes you imagine the walls are speaking to you. It feels friendly
FIRST fruits of the National Lottery were a mixed crop for good
causes. Buying Mar Lodge Estate for heritage's sake was a mature gift
that at #10 million was also luscious. More than ripe -- verging on a
rotten apple -- was the windfall of even more bucks to the Churchill
family for Winston's papers.
Much deserved in the scramble for the smaller lots of bingo loot was
how well Dundee did. Right in its lap landed a plum.
Dundee asked for #419,000 from the memorial fund and that odd-looking
amount was exactly what it got. ''When we put in applications for funds,
we do our sums plainly,'' said Jonathan Bryant, chief executive of
Dundee Heritage Trust. Simple subtraction was the key. Having totted up
what it needed, the trust took away how much regional European money it
had in the kitty. That left it, precisely, #419,000 short to be going on
with.
Winning it all put Dundee at the top of the six-figure successes who
came after the millionaire beneficiaries.
Explaining how things worked, Lord Rothschild, chairman of the
National Heritage Memorial Fund, said: ''What we are looking for is
quality, and projects which affect the lives of people.'' He saw justice
in the claims of jute.
Restitching jute into the fabric of Dundee's industrial life has been
hardly less arduous and tricky than it once was to work. Thirteen years
ago the idea of a textile museum was a gleam in the eyes of some amateur
loyalists. Progress since has been by a series of diverse, inventive
phases much like cloth manufacture used to be. ''We raise a bit of
money, spend it, raise a bit more,'' Jonathan Bryant said.
Lottery money will help pay for museum displays at Verdant Works, the
pastoral name of a former factory restored by the heritage trust down an
industrial wynd where, once upon a time, five spinning mills stood. It
will take seven more years before the jute show is in full swing.
Already, though, colourful yarns are being spun about it. They have
even reached royal ears. On his boat trip on Britannia last month the
Prince of Wales asked to come in for a look. On some summer weekends the
museum's doors will be open for Dundonians to go in and see the progress
for themselves.
As a working museum the Verdant Works are, as yet, more working than
they are a museum.
Dave Diduca, the museum engineer, has its machinery installed and
clattering. ''There are breakdowns,'' he conceded. ''But nearly
everything has had to be put together again.''
His machines are not muckle factory brutes. They are laboratory
versions once used to teach college students. But they clack
thunderously just the same. Already they have produced some cones of
thread. Dave Diduca's hands are the first to have been turned to jute
production at the Verdant Works for a century.
Built in 1833, the mill's career has been mixed. It has been a
crockery warehouse. Once it housed a trader in rabbit skins. Carpets
were made in one part of it. Its immediate previous use was as a yard
for metal scrap.
Through it all, however, the works retained their jute pedigree.
Traditional features endured. The old mill kept its a cobbled courtyard,
a gatehouse, and the stump of a lum. A splendid mahogany office with
high stools for the clerks somehow survived.
Restoring Verdant to a fit working condition called for heavy toil by
many volunteers with loyal hearts, willing backs -- and strong stomachs.
Alan White, the trust's fundraiser, believed that, before the machinery
could be moved in, 17 tons of pigeon droppings had to be moved out.
David Hanton, the museum custodian, who has spent more time, often on
his own, at Verdant than anybody else, believed that jute memories have
found their ideal home. ''Sometimes you imagine the walls are speaking
to you,'' he said. ''It feels like a building that has been waiting for
us. It feels friendly.
''There have been some great moments. When you had spent a long dirty
day clearing up rubble, it would suddenly give up a treasure. You'd come
across an old workbench with its hand-made tools left on top. It was
magic,'' he said.
Of all jute's useful qualities, the holding of magic does not
obviously apply. It was everyday stuff. Employment was fickle. While
wages for women workers were meagre, the millowners could afford
ostentatious mansions in Broughty Ferry. Some of them became country
lairds. While jute was the making of Dundee, it also divided the city.
''Heritage cannot be valueless,'' Jonathan Bryant said. ''Somebody has
to take a view about how a story is presented. We are aware of our
responsibilities.
''It would be wrong of us to create some cosy impression of everybody
being happy working 14 hours a day.
Besides, there is Dundee's part in world history to tell. When the
covered wagons rolled to the American West, it was the city's jutemakers
who had covered them. Dundee was also committed in a way that was total
to the American Civil War. With an even hand it supplied sandbags to
both sides.
0 Dundonians know how to salute their past in harsh poetry and defiant
song. To preserve physically a part of their city's story they see
Verdant as a last chance. But because they collected its furnishings
before they had a house to put them in, their museum already has roots.
They were firmly planted away back in 1982 when enthusiasts of Abertay
Historical Society saw an industrial past being taken to the coup and
found the readies to stop the dumping. They rescued material from a
factory that was closing and fostered the classroom machinery from the
College of Commerce.
Three years later the heritage trust was formed to find them a home
and the means to pay for it. Bit by bit under William Low, the trust
chairman, they can now see their way to a total cost of #2m.
Dundee's place on the map has somehow always seemed insecure. Even
Dundonians often sound less than certain about where they are. Local
tourist literature took to calling the city the ''Geneva of the north''.
The late James Cameron, the Fleet Street journalist and television
broadcaster who had a Dundee apprenticeship, thought of the place as a
kind of Naples.
Perhaps, the schoolboy tag of jute, jam, and journalism is as crisply
accurate a label as any. And, yes, when the textile display is complete,
three floors of the Verdant Works will become a first museum of
journalism. Print artefacts are gifts in store from the giant Dandy and
Beano D C Thomson company.
But will there be jam on it? At the centre of Verdant is a glassed-in
alley that one day will house the museum shop and a cafe. Jonathan
Bryant agreed there was a temptation to include lots of local marmalades
and jellies. ''And we will not be resisting the temptation,'' he
promised.
*Verdant Works has its next open weekend on August 5 and 6.

THE man who failed by one vote in nine to become chief executive of
Glasgow City Council earlier this year had the consolation yesterday of
being appointed the new authority's senior depute chief executive.
The appointment of Mr Tom Monaghan, 48, currently chief executive of
Glasgow District Council, is expected to dilute the bitterness felt by
some city councillors over the appointment in April of a senior regional
council official, Mr John Anderson, as chief executive of the council.
Mr Anderson was depute chief executive of Strathclyde region when he
landed the #96,000-a-year city council job and some councillors feared
this might herald the start of a regional council takeover at the City
Chambers.
However, after Mr Anderson's appointment, the Labour leader of the new
authority, Councillor Robert Gould, said he would be ''disappointed if
Mr Monaghan wasn't placed within the operation of this council''.
Mrs Sarah Wood, 47, was appointed depute chief executive of the new
authority.
Mrs Wood is senior depute director of social work with Strathclyde
region.
Mr Ian Cumming, depute director of legal services for Strathclyde
Regional Council, was appointed director of legal services.

THE stud groom who blasted millionaire racehorse trainer Alex Scott to
death with a 12-bore shotgun was jailed for life yesterday after a jury
found him guilty of murder.
William ''Clem'' O'Brien showed no emotion in the dock when the jury
of seven men and five women returned their verdicts at Norwich Crown
Court.
The family and friends of Mr Scott cheered and applauded as the
foreman announced the majority 10-2 verdict. The jury had been out for
nearly five hours.
They returned a verdict of not guilty on the second charge, of
threatening to kill gardener Christopher Forster, the only witness to
the shooting in the barn at Glebe Stud, Cheveley, near Newmarket.
The jury rejected O'Brien's claim that he was guilty only of
manslaughter on the grounds that Mr Scott, 34, had provoked him by
calling him an ''Irish bastard'', words the prosecution had maintained
were never used.
Sentencing O'Brien, Mr Justice Blofeld told him: ''You brought tragedy
into many people's lives.
''You brought tragedy particularly to the Scott family, Mrs Scott and
her three children, and you brought tragedy into Mrs O'Brien's life.
''It is a terrible thing you did. For reasons that are difficult to
fathom, you totally lost your temper and in a moment of passion you
picked up that gun and shot Mr Scott.''
Outside the building, Mr Scott's wife Julia, 38, told reporters: ''I
am very relieved that the trial is over and justice has been done.
''However, nothing will bring back Alex, senselessly killed in the
prime of his life. He had so much to live for and look forward to, both
with his family and in his training career.''
Mr Scott's brother, Charles, said: ''The verdict came as a relief but
not a surprise. But no sentence my brother's killer receives can begin
to make amends.''
O'Brien's wife, Helen, who gave evidence for her husband on Thursday,
was not in court when he was convicted and sentenced.
When she left court after describing her last moments with her husband
before his arrest -- he still had the 12-bore shotgun in his hands and
his only words were, ''Sorry, Helen'' -- she said she did not intend to
return to see the end of the trial.
''I couldn't bear to be here for that,'' she said. ''It was bad enough
being here to give evidence. I don't want to make any comment yet.
''I want the truth about this to come out but I am prepared to wait.''
During his evidence, O'Brien had told how he had come to Britain from
Ireland at the age of 19 to work in a series of studs. His work was his
life, he was a perfectionist, and took pleasure in the way his previous
employer at Glebe Stud had given him such a free hand that he came to
regard the stud as his own.
However, after Mr Scott, widely seen as likely to become one of the
very top trainers in racing, bought the stud in December 1992, things
changed dramatically. A series of arguments developed about how the stud
should be run.
The prosecution had said that, during a ''blazing row'' two days
before the killing, O'Brien had told Mr Scott ''to stuff his job''.
He had said Mr Scott should have been kept in the ''loony bin'' and
the key thrown away -- a reference to Mr Scott's stay in a nursing home
in 1990, being treated for depression.
Mr Scott went to O'Brien's bungalow, with Mr Forster as witness, and
told O'Brien to confirm his resignation in writing, stop work
immediately, and clear his possessions from the barn he had used for
years.
According to the prosecution, O'Brien deliberately took his shotgun
back inside the barn as part of a ''calculated'' plan to lure his
employer to his death.
The jury rejected the defence claim that the loaded gun was already
there because it was used to scare pigeons, and that O'Brien picked it
up only when he ''just flipped'' after being called an ''Irish
bastard''.
Mr Forster had given evidence that O'Brien had told him: ''I am going
to get the old man in the barn; I am going to shut the door and no-one
will see what goes on.''
At one point during the jury's retirement, the judge responded to
requests by TV companies to use pictures taken when he and the jury, the
defendant, and counsel visited Glebe Stud on Thursday last week, the
second day of the trial.
Mr Justice Blofeld said pictures taken at the stud before their
arrival or after their departure could be used. He had no authority to
direct otherwise.
Pictures of himself, the accused or the jury arriving or leaving could
be used provided that no members of the jury were identifiable.
However, no pictures taken of the stud, even from the road outside,
while he and the jury were present, could be used because at that time
the stud was, in law, a court.

THE Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) has advised customers
of a Glasgow-based travel company, which collapsed this week, to check
with the tour operators involved to establish whether their holiday
packages were booked by the travel agency.
Abta said yesterday) that holidays which were booked by Prestige
Travel, Duke Street, Dennistoun, with various tour operators would be
honoured by the operators, while customers who paid the agency for
''specific holidays'', which were not booked, would be recompensed by
Abta, of which the agency is a member.
Mr Geoff Covey, communications officer at Abta, said people currently
on holiday with Prestige Travel or who have a confirmed booking with the
company, would not be affected by its collapse, while those who had paid
for only part of their holiday would simply pay the remainder to the
operator.
He added: ''Those people who think they have booked specific holidays
but have no confirmation invoice should contact the tour operator in the
first instance -- mainly Inspirations and Avro -- to see whether a
booking was made.
''If a booking was not made, they should contact Abta's claims
department and then their claim against the failed agency will be
processed and they will be given the full amount back out of our
(Abta's) trust fund which is made up of funds from member companies.''
A spokeswoman for Inspirations, which is based at Horley, near London,
said yesterday: ''If money hasn't been passed on, that is covered by
Abta. If it has, Inspirations will take over the booking. We have more
than 100 people who have booked through the travel agents with
Inspirations for the summer of 1995.''
A spokeswoman for Avro, which is based in London, said the company had
78 people who were booked through Prestige Travel between now and the
end of the summer. A spokesperson for Prestige Travel could not be
contacted.
Strathclyde Police confirmed yesterday that it had been ''consulted''
about a matter relating to Prestige Travel but said they had received no
official complaint from the company or about the company and were not
investigating the matter.

ARISTOCRATIC wild child Lady Alice Douglas married her convict lover
yesterday in the oddest society wedding of the year.
Armed robber Simon Melia was given a week's leave from his nine-year
sentence to wed the 30-year-old daughter of the 12th Marquess of
Queensberry in Conwy, north Wales.
Drama teacher Lady Alice was Melia's Lady Macbeth when they trod the
boards together at Suffolk's Blundeston Prison.
The Queensberry family fortune disappeared generations ago and the
current marquess, David Douglas, 65, has built a reputation as a
professor of ceramics.
''I wish Alice tremendous happiness,'' he said yesterday. ''I have
never seen two people who looked happier but only the years will tell.''
He admitted to having ''some misgivings'' when he first learned of
Melia's record. ''But I always think in life you are quite lucky if you
don't go to prison. I think there is a Russian proverb to that effect.''

A MAN was cleared yesterday of child sex abuse charges after his
alleged victim, a four-year-old girl, would not speak in court.
The girl, believed to be the youngest yet to give evidence in a
Scottish court, sat on her mother's knee but refused to answer
questions.
Even after being transferred to her father's knee, she just fidgeted
and played with a doll.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was called as a
witness at Elgin Sheriff Court in the trial of Mr Allan Geddes, 51,
alleged to have behaved indecently towards her.
He denied using lewd and libidinous behaviour and practices towards
her at his home in South Street, Newmill, near Keith, on June 20 this
year.
A screen was erected to shield the girl from Mr Geddes as he sat in
the dock. He was able to watch her on a television monitor.
Miss Rosemary Gallagher, a solicitor at the Scottish Child Law Centre,
said it illustrated the problems of using children as witnesses.
She said that, despite the use of closed-circuit television links and
efforts by the sheriff and lawyers to make the environment more
child-friendly, appearing in court remained an exceptionally traumatic
experience for youngsters.
''I have not heard of a case where the witness has been as young as
this. It can be a very intimidating experience for an adult, never mind
a child of four,'' she said.
''There are some questions as to how effective the use of
closed-circuit television is for child witnesses. There is also a
question of whether a child of four understands the concepts between
telling lies and telling the truth''.
At an earlier hearing, the girl's father told the court how he had
gone to Mr Geddes's house, suspecting his daughter might be there.
When he found her, he took her outside and she alleged that Mr Geddes
had touched her pants.
The father told defence agent Patricia Black that he had not jumped to
the wrong conclusion, otherwise he would not have put his daughter
through the ordeal of a court appearance.
The girl's mother said her daughter had demonstrated how Mr Geddes had
allegedly lifted up her skirt and touched her.
However, the girl herself was unable to answer questions put to her by
procurator-fiscal James McKay and Mrs Black.
On that occasion, proceedings were adjourned to allow the case to be
heard early in the morning, when it was thought the girl would be
fresher.
Yesterday, Sheriff Noel McPartlin, who had dispensed with his wig and
gown for the sitting, joined the girl and her parents at the table in
the well of the court.
Despite repeated attempts by both the sheriff and prosecution to get
her to relax, she still would not speak.
Asked if she watched the popular Australian TV soap Home and Away, the
girl just hung her head and reached out towards her mother.
The only time she said anything was when Mr McKay asked her what her
doll was called. ''Charlie,'' she replied shyly.
After 15 minutes had elapsed, the girl was taken out of the courtroom
and Mr McKay announced that he did not wish to proceed with the case.
''I have no intention of proceeding any further with the matter at
hand,'' he said.
Sheriff McPartlin told Mr Geddes: ''No further evidence is to be led
and Mr McKay is not seeking a prosecution. Therefore, I formally find
you not guilty and you are free to go.''
Outside the court, the girl's mother and father refused to comment on
the case and Mr McKay said there was nothing he could add.
Mr Geddes, surrounded by family and friends, also refused to comment.
The Crown Office in Edinburgh last night declined to comment on the
outcome of the case.
Miss Gallagher said a further difficulty arose in the length of time
and questioning.
''The child has probably been interviewed already by God knows how
many people. Quite often children cannot get counselling during this
process in case you are left with the allegation that evidence has been
contaminated.
''In an ideal world, evidence should be taken from the child at the
earliest stage and then the child can get appropriate counselling and
support.''
Others involved in child-care issues have advocated a switch from
solely concentrating on children's evidence and how they deliver it to
more active detective work at the outset based on the clues given in
initial statements.
''It is a terrible burden on children when they are the prime source
of evidence. Perhaps what we should be looking at is wider
investigations,'' added Miss Gallagher.

BRITISH ferry companies last night looked unlikely to act on the
findings of a damning report about the safety of their vessels, produced
by the Commons Transport Select Committee.
It said safety improvements were needed on ferries, that existing ship
''survivability'' regulations were inadequate, and that the pace of
change in the industry was too leisurely.
The committee's only Scottish member, Cunninghame South MP Brian
Donohoe, said yesterday: ''The basis on which ferries are allowed to
operate must be under constant review in light of recent experience.
''That is why there is a need to tighten up the current regulations,
so that we can learn from past mistakes.''
However, ferry companies reacted by saying they were waiting for a
report, due to be published in November, from world shipping's governing
body, the International Maritime Organisation.
Both main Scottish operators, Caledonian MacBrayne and P&amp;O, have
insisted that their vessels comply fully with international regulations.
The IMO report is expected to call for various measures to improve the
chances of ships staying afloat for long enough to ensure that
passengers can be taken off safely..
However, the member countries of the IMO are known to be hopelessly
split on the safety recommendations. The UK Government is in a minority
which supports a more stringent approach, and may be forced into a
unilateral stance after November, to get ferry companies using UK ports
to bring in the changes without international agreement.
In its widely-leaked report, Cross Channel Safety, the committee said
ferries should be altered so they stayed afloat after an accident for up
to four times longer than they do at present.
The report said modifications would not be costly, might put only #1
extra on passengers' tickets, and could be done within four years.
Committee members encouraged the UK Government to go it alone on
introducing changes if there was no international agreement. They also
suggested that ferries carry hotel-style star classifications,
indicating the safety standards that each vessel had reached.
* The new Stornoway car ferry, Isle of Lewis, undertook her maiden
voyage yesterday with invited guests on board. Scottish Office Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the ship had been built to the highest
safety standards.
The #16m ferry, which was delivered by Ferguson Shipbuilders of Port
Glasgow five weeks ahead of schedule, enters service on Monday, and will
make the crossing to Ullapool an hour faster than its predecessor.

WELL-HEELED party animals are being invited to board an 8400-mile
flight on Concorde to the Caribbean for one night, at a cost of nearly
#10,000 per couple.
The 6.15pm flight from Heathrow tonight will touch down in Barbados
ready for the first sundowner cocktail at 5.30pm before a night on the
town.
The return flight departs at 12.30pm on Sunday and arrives back into
London at 9.45pm, in time to iron a shirt for Monday morning.
British Airways says the cost of the night out is #4620 a person for a
return ticket.
BA usually runs Concorde flights to Bridgetown, Barbados, between
October and March, but because of demand will this year operate the
service every Saturday from today until August 27.
Captain David Rowland, Concorde's commercial manager, said: ''There is
less than 1000 seats available between now and August 27 -- and already
space is filling up.
''We are clearly a nation which still knows how to enjoy itself.''
Travelling at 1500mph, Concorde takes four hours and 15 minutes to fly
from London to Barbados, half the time in a normal jet. The flights will
carry everything from vintage champagne, mouthwash, caviar, toothpicks,
silver napkin rings, and rubber hot-water bottles.

<HEADLINE>Watchdogs bid to stop export of royal crowns</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977158397</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ART watchdogs are trying to prevent the export of three crowns once
worn by British kings and queens.
The silver frames of the Imperial State Crown of George I (dating from
1715), Coronation Crown of George IV (1821) and Coronation Crown of
Queen Adelaide (1831), stripped of their jewels, are up for sale -- and
could be bought with National Lottery money.
National Heritage Minister Lord Inglewood yesterday announced the
deferment of decisions on export licence applications by the London art
dealers, Asprey, which now owns the crowns.
The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art is empowered to
seek buyers within Britain to save the crowns, considered to be part of
the nation's heritage, from going abroad.
Export of a first-century Celtic strap-union from a chariot horse
harness is also being blocked until after January 24 next year.
Minimum offers from British-based buyers are now being sought of
#576,000 for the George I crown, #376,000 for the George IV crown, and
#425,000 for the Queen Adelaide crown.
A museum, such as the British Museum or Victoria and Albert, could
apply to the Heritage Memorial Fund for #1,377,000 of National Lottery
money to buy them and keep them on public display in Britain.
The Celtic strap-union, which is not owned by Asprey, is priced at
#2940.63.
It seems likely that all three crown frames were retained by
Rundell's, the royal goldsmiths, when the stones were broken from them
in the 1820s and 1830s.
All three frames subsequently entered the ownership of Mr William
Daniel-Tyssen, an MP, distinguished bibliophile, and collector, who
became Baron Amherst of Hackney in 1892. They were lent by the Amherst
family to the Museum of London from 1933 to 1985.
They were acquired from dealers in 1987 by Asprey, which now wishes to
take them to the International Antique Dealers' Fair in New York for
sale.
''It has always been our wish that these things should be kept in
Britain,'' said Asprey antiques director Mr Charles Truman.
''We approached a number of institutions, including the British Museum
and the Victoria and Albert.''

A FORMER prisoner last night confirmed that he was helping Moors
murderer Myra Hindley to write her autobiography.
Scot Mark Leech, who was released from Saughton Prison in Edinburgh in
March after serving a seven-year sentence for a robbery he insists he
did not commit, has been visiting Hindley at her cell in Durham jail.
He said last night that four publishers were contesting the right to
publish the book, which is expected to be published early next year with
all profits going to children's charities. Hindley has asked him to edit
her tale.
Mr Leech defended the project. ''I think it's very important that,
after 30 years, we hear her side of the story. Without it, we wouldn't
ever know exactly what happened.''
He described Hindley, 53, as ''a very intelligent, very lonely woman
who speaks softly and appears to be a committed Christian''.
In 1966, Hindley and her lover, Glasgow-born Ian Brady, were jailed
for life after being convicted of murdering Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and
John Kilbride. Eight years ago, the pair confessed to killing Keith
Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16, on the moors near their Manchester
home.
Mr Leech, 37, an award-winning writer and journalist who now lives in
Bristol, was regarded by the Scottish prison establishment as something
of a thorn in its side.
He undertook a large number of successful legal actions against the
authorities, usually for breaches of prison guidelines.
Earlier this year, his latest book was published, an inmates' guide to
the 136 jails in England and Wales. A separate edition on Scottish
prisons is planned.

A 29-year-old shoplifter yesterday became the first person to be
''tagged'' as part of a new trial of electronic monitoring of offenders.
Magistrates at King's Lynn, Norfolk, made the tagging order after
Clive Barratt admitted shoplifting and failing to surrender to custody.
He is now banned from leaving his home between 8am and 8pm daily until
the end of October.
From Monday, if he breaks the 12-hour curfew, an electronic tag
attached to his wrist will alert police that he has left his home.
Barratt supports the #1.4m scheme.''It is just better than prison. If
I am on a curfew I can be back with my family and make a fresh start,''
he said.
The tagging trial began formally in Manchester and Norfolk earlier
this month. It had been delayed because some devices failed to give a
warning during tests.

A SCOTTISH leather company has made new inroads into the motor
industry with a #3m order to supply hides to French car manufacturer
Renault.
The bumper order, announced yesterday, places the Renfrewshire-based
Bridge of Weir Leather fifth in the league of UK suppliers to Renault's
car division.
The deal, which has helped boost employment at the tannery from 130 to
190, involves providing leather for 15,300 Safranes and Laguna models
over a 12-month period.
Mr Michel Gigou, Renault UK managing director, said: ''We are
committed to ever-higher quality standards and Bridge of Weir Leather's
role as a supplier is a reflection of that central philosophy.''
Bridge of Weir Leather managing director, Mr Jonathan Muirhead, added:
''Renault wants world-class suppliers and hopefully this will lead to a
long-term relationship.''
He added: ''The Auld Alliance between our two nations stands us in
good stead and there is a genuine rapport which extends to involvement
in early stages of research and development of projects.''
Bridge of Weir Leather already supplies Volvo, Saab, Honda, and
Chrysler UK.

HOUSEWIFE Sara Thornton, jailed for life in 1990 for murdering her
violent husband, left prison last night after being granted bail pending
her renewed appeal.
As she left the gates of Holloway jail in north London, she turned
round and shouted up at the windows: ''I love you.''
She said: ''It has been a long afternoon and I am tired. I am going to
have something to eat, probably some fruit.''
Before being driven off by her solicitor, Ms Gareth Peirce, she said
she was confident she would win her appeal. Campaigners see the granting
of bail as the first move towards her permanent release.
The move, which follows the freeing of two other women jailed for the
murders of their violent husbands, was greeted with jubilation by
supporters and women's groups.
Thornton said: ''I know what my grounds are and I know what my case
is. I was hoping that I would be released today.
''Holloway is overcrowded and there is not enough staff -- it is very,
very bad. But I am very relieved, it is hard to believe it after so
long.''
Wearing leggings and a baggy shirt, she smiled for photographers and
hugged Ms Peirce.
Also with her was Jennifer Nadel, who wrote a book about the case two
years ago called The Story of a Woman Who Killed.
Thornton was mobbed by cheering supporters and well-wishers. She
kissed and hugged them before being driven off to a secret address.
In a statement earlier, Ms Peirce said: ''Mrs Thornton is very pleased
to have been granted bail.
''The primary consideration that was focused upon in her application
for bail was the strength of her arguments on appeal.
''We trust that in due course our confidence in the strength of those
arguments will be endorsed by the full Court of Appeal.
''In the meantime, Mrs Thornton would like to thank the thousands of
individuals who have helped and supported her.''
Bail was granted at a brief private hearing before Court of Appeal
judge Mr Justice Sachs.
Her case has been referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Home
Secretary, Mr Michael Howard. The hearing is expected in the autumn.
Thornton, 38, of Atherstone, Warwickshire, stabbed her husband,
Malcolm, to death with a kitchen knife in June 1989 and was sentenced to
life imprisonment at Birmingham Crown Court in February 1990.
Her case was taken up by women's rights supporters, who hailed the
decision as ''splendid''.
However, the decision did not please Mr Thornton's family. His sister
Jean Murray, who has always claimed he was not violent, said she was
''totally disgusted'' and would write to the Home Office in protest.
''The whole of Malcolm's family feels let down and disappointed with
British justice and the ability of the courts to protect the public,''
she said.
''This is just a mockery of the system. There has already been one
appeal. What is happening now is just a joke.''
Mrs Murray, from Blackpool, believed the decision to release Thornton
on bail had more to do with feminist pressure than with justice.
Thornton's feelings were being put ahead of the grief of the family, who
were not being considered.
She added: ''I don't believe Sara Thornton was a battered wife,
certainly not to the extent that it warranted a killing.''
The Justice for Women group, which has supported Thornton's case, was
''extremely pleased'' at the court's ''humane approach . . . a brave and
robust decision''.
Their spokeswoman, Ms Sarah Maguire, believed Thornton would have
telephoned her daughter Luise to tell her the news. The 16-year-old is
being cared for by Thornton's sister in the United States.
Thornton's original appeal against conviction was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal in 1991.
The case highlighted the issue of women who killed violent partners.
Kiranjit Ahluwalia, who burned her husband to death after suffering 10
years of brutality, had her murder conviction overturned by the Appeal
Court in the summer of 1992, after it accepted her guilty plea to a
manslaughter charge.
Earlier this month, Emma Humphreys, who had spent more than 10 years
in prison after being convicted of murdering her brutal boyfriend, was
freed.

IN A clear signal that he is attempting to unite all wings of the Tory
Party in Scotland, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has appointed Mr
Brian Meek, one of the party's leading devolutionists, as his political
adviser.
The post will be unpaid and on an informal basis but the appointment
indicates Mr Forsyth could be prepared to cede more tax-raising powers
to councils and to drop capping of local authorities, moves Mr Meek has
often advocated during his 25 years' uninterrupted service as a
Conservative councillor.
There are also signs that Mr Forsyth may be moving towards those in
the party who favour greater devolution for Scotland.
Mr Meek said Mr Forsyth had told him ''he was interested in any
devolution that did not include a tax-raising assembly''.
Mr Meek, a columnist and sports writer for The Herald, has not
hesitated to criticise his own party's shortcomings, particularly as
they relate to Scots, in print. The appointment may also counter-balance
Mr Forsyth's appointment of Sunday Times columnist Gerald Warner, a
right winger, to the key Civil Service post as special adviser at the
Scottish Office.
Mr Warner's appointment was interpreted by some as evidence that Mr
Forsyth had not forsaken his Libertarian views. However, recent moves by
Mr Forsyth on the Fort William sleeper service, education reforms, the
composition of the new water authorities, and local authority powers,
have indicated the Scottish Secretary is prepared to relax previous
policy.
Mr Meek said Mr Forsyth phoned him on Thursday evening and asked him
if he would be prepared to advise him, and that he had accepted.
''Yes, I was surprised, but since he came back to Scotland, Mr Forsyth
has made a point of talking to all wings of the party. I suppose it was
a natural progression that he would get to me sometime,'' said Mr Meek.
He added: ''It is an unpaid role, similar to when I was a special
adviser to Malcolm Rifkind when he was Secretary of State. I will not be
a civil servant. I will be advising the Secretary of State on a regular
weekly basis on matters relating to anything he wants to ask about.''
Mr Meek is a past convener of Lothian Regional Council, a current
member of Edinburgh District Council, and chairman of the opposition
Tory group on the City of Edinburgh Council (the new shadow authority).
Mr Meek, although he has said in print in the past that, ''Mr Forsyth
is no friend of mine'', seems determined to draw a line across past
differences.
He added: ''Michael Forsyth and I have the same aim: to have a
Conservative Government returned at the next election. I think it would
be childish and churlish to say 'no' to the Secretary of State if he
comes and asks for my advice.''
Asked if he felt that Mr Forsyth was showing a more conciliatory
attitude this time round, Mr Meek said: ''He appears to be trying very
hard. He charmed Cosla the other day -- no easy task -- which was a very
astute political move.''

SARA Thornton took a long knife from a kitchen drawer at her home and
killed her husband Malcolm with a single stab as he lay on a sofa in a
drunken slumber on June 14, 1989.
She called police and ambulance officers, was arrested and charged
with murder. The couple had been together for two years and married for
10 months.
Thornton's case has been championed by feminist groups as a test case
for battered wives.
At her trial at Birmingham Crown Court in February 1990, no attempt
was made to link her state of mind with the violence she had endured
during her brief marriage.
It ended in a mandatory life sentence for the murder of her husband, a
former policeman, who had been due to appear in court for attacking her.
Her appeal was turned down because of the time that had elapsed
between the alleged provocation and the killing.
In Holloway Prison, Thornton, of Atherstone, Warwickshire, started a
20-day hunger strike after hearing that a man had been given a two-year
suspended sentence after killing his nagging, alcoholic, wife.
Women held a vigil outside the jail calling for her to be freed and
for a change in the law dealing with provocation.
Thornton ended the hunger strike only when her daughter Luise flew
from California to ask her not to kill herself.
Two years ago, Home Secretary Michael Howard turned down a plea for a
second Appeal Court hearing on the grounds that the original trial
lawyers had access to all the evidence of abuse and psychological trauma
and should have used it.
As a teenager, she ran away to Germany, returning to train as a
nursery nurse to please her mother. In Denmark, she was briefly married
to a German by whom she had Luise.
In a pub in 1987, she met Malcolm Thornton.
When drink-fuelled ''benders'' became more frequent and violent, she
begged him to go to Alcoholics Anonymous.
He had punched her, pushed her through a shop plate-glass window,
smashed her hands with an ashtray and threatened to kill her and her
daughter.
The Birmingham trial excluded the psychological effects of sustained
brutality.
At the first appeal, judges said Thornton could have walked out or run
upstairs.
The judgment was based on case law dating from 1949 when Lord Denning
ruled that provocation could be applied only to a killing committed in
the heat of the moment.
In May, the Home Secretary referred the case back to the Appeal Court
on the basis of new witness accounts of the violence inflicted on
Thornton.
The case has prompted the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, to argue
that the law on provocation might need to be reviewed.

PARATROOPER Lee Clegg has been told he can stay in the Army, the
Ministry of Defence announced last night.
However, Private Clegg, whose release from jail earlier this month
after serving four years for the murder of a Belfast joyrider sparked
fury among republicans in Ulster, may not stay in the Parachute
Regiment.
A decision on which unit the 26-year-old soldier will serve with will
be made only after a period of retraining.
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: ''The Army Board decided that
the circumstances of his conviction and sentence were exceptional and
merited his retention in the Army.''
Private Clegg was released on licence from Wakefield Prison by
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew on July 3.
He was jailed for the murder of Karen Reilly, who died when an Army
patrol fired 36 bullets at a stolen car speeding through a checkpoint in
Belfast on September 30, 1990.
The Irish Government yesterday authorised the release of 12 more IRA
prisoners as part of their continuing response to the Northern Ireland
peace process.
0 The releases -- which are certain to intensify pressure on the
British Government for further moves by them on the paramilitary
prisoner front -- were given the go-ahead by Irish Justice Minister Nora
Owen.
In London, the Government yesterday lifted a 10-year ban on funding to
organisations suspected of paramilitary links in Northern Ireland.
The decision was made because of the assumption that the IRA and
loyalist ceasefires are permanent, the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, said.
The Northern Ireland Office also confirmed that no-parking control
zones introduced more than 20 years ago to try to thwart car-bomb
attacks are to go from midnight on Monday.
It means motorists will be free to park their vehicles and leave them
unattended anywhere in city and town centre streets across the province
without the threat of them being blown up by the security forces.
A #250m peace package for Northern Ireland and Irish border counties
was also been approved. The European Commission cash will be used to
create jobs, help urban and rural regeneration, and improve cross-border
co-operation.

AT least five rival bids for the future ownership of Rosyth Naval Base
are thought to have been submitted to Edinburgh property company, Ryden,
which is handling the sale for the Ministry of Defence.
Yesterday, however, as the 2pm deadline passed, the company could not
release details of the companies involved.
While the consortium Rosyth 2000, including Babcock International,
Forth Ports Authority, the Bank of Scotland, and ScottishPower are
thought to be front runners to take over the site, it was rumoured
strongly that Clydeport officially has entered the race.
No-one at Clydeport would comment yesterday. A spokesman for Ryden
said he could not reveal the exact number of bids because the
transactions had been carried out on a sealed bid process.
He added that Ryden's may be in a position to make an official
statement after a meeting with Ministry of Defence officials on Monday.
A final decision on the successful applicant is not expected until the
end of August.
In addition to Scottish-based companies such as the Miller Group,
interest has been shown by foreign concerns from India, China, Saudi
Arabia, and the US.
Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Miller Group said no bid had been
submitted by the company.
Ryden managing partner, Mr Roy Durie, was not available for comment
yesterday.
The 355-acre Rosyth base, scheduled to close in April next year, could
fetch as much as #15m -- it includes extensive shipping berths and the
base commander's mansion.
Yesterday, Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd's director, Mr Allan Macpherson
confirmed that his company was extremely interested in operating a new
facility and had assembled ''a powerful group of people'' including Sir
Bob Reid as a non-executive chairman to head its bid.
Speaking on behalf of the company's directors, he said: ''We are of
the view that Babcock, with a presence here already, has the potential
to operate this integrated site, maximise it, and re-generate the area.
''We feel it is also significant that Forth Ports Authority is part of
the consortium, interested in developing the tidal area.''
Unlike Leith, vessels are able to berth at Rosyth at any time because
there are no tide problems.

LABOUR, the Liberal Democrats, and the Tories were last night engaged
in a bitter war of words over the outcome of the Littleborough and
Saddleworth by-election as the parties stepped up a gear in the build-up
to the next General Election.
The by-election was won by the Liberal Democrats with a majority of
1993, overturning a Tory majority of 4494. Nevertheless, it was a good
night for Labour, who came second with 34% of the vote compared to the
Liberal Democrats' 39%, and the Tories were putting as brave a face as
they could on their latest by-election drubbing.
A Tory inquest was launched as their candidate, Mr John Hudson, was
pushed into third place with 9934 votes, well behind Liberal Democrat
victor Chris Davies, who polled 16,231 votes, and Labour's Phil Woolas,
who came second with 14,238 votes.
Labour achieved a 14% increase in its vote -- far bigger than the 3%
rise won by the Liberal Democrats -- as the Tory share of the vote won
in 1992 by the late Geoffrey Dickens slumped by 21%. His death in May
led to the by-election.
The Liberal Democrats, understandably, were celebrating. A party
spokesman pointed out that in the six by-elections held in Conservative
seats since the last General Election, the Liberal Democrats had won
four -- the two exceptions being Dudley, won by Labour, and Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn's Perth and Kinross, won by the SNP.
The Liberal Democrat share of the vote over these by-elections has
averaged 41%, compared to 25% for the Tories and 24% for Labour.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said yesterday: ''This is a
superb result. The Conservative majority has been cut to single figures
by a Liberal Democrat victory. Even with all the Labour hype of the last
year and the fact that Labour have thrown everything into winning this
by-election, the Liberal Democrats have proved that, when it comes to
real votes in real ballot boxes, the British people choose Liberal
Democrats to defeat the Government.''
The Tory majority in the House technically now is reduced to nine but
is effectively reduced to seven or eight, because two Tory MPs, Dame
Janet Fookes and Mr Michael Morris, are Deputy Speakers and therefore do
not vote, while another Tory, Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston) is
currently refusing to take the Tory whip but would probably support the
Tories on most issues except Europe and therefore becomes part of the
equation.
The Liberal Democrat victor in the by-election, Mr Davies, said:
''This was a key test for Labour. Tony Blair made it clear and his
deputy predicted victory. They said this was a seat where Labour sought
to replace the Liberal Democrats and leapfrog over ourselves and appeal
to Conservative voters. They failed.''
However, Labour leader Tony Blair said: ''This has shown once more
that new Labour is winning new support in every part of the country. The
result is another huge blow to the Conservatives and further evidence
that the leadership election made no difference whatever to their
fortunes.
The defeated Labour candidate, Mr Woolas, said it had been a
tremendous result for Labour, adding: ''It was a Pyrrhic victory for
protest, it is a convincing vote for change.''
Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney, trying to put the best gloss he
could on a bleak night, said: ''I am encouraged that the bedrock of
Conservative support held up and held firm this time in a way that we
haven't seen in recent by-elections.''
He also detected ''the first stirrings'' of a swing back to the Tories
by the voters, following Mr Major's leadership victory. However, with
less than two years to go before the next election, he admitted: ''I do
not gainsay the fact that we have a serious challenge on our hands.''
On the strength of the by-election result, both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats can claim to be in pole position to win the two marginal seats
which will replace Littleborough and Saddleworth because of boundary
changes at the next General Election, but the Labour position is the
stronger of the two.
The Littleborough part of the seat will be transferred to Rochdale, at
present represented by Liberal Democrat Liz Lynne, and Saddleworth will
go to Oldham East and Saddleworth.
According to a survey commissioned by PA News, the BBC, ITN, and Sky
News, from election experts at the University of Plymouth, both seats
would have been on a knife edge if the revised boundaries had been in
force in the 1992 election.
The Liberal Democrats would have won Rochdale, but with Labour needing
a swing of just 0.1% to take over.
Oldham East and Saddleworth would have been Tory in 1992, with the
Liberal Democrats hard on their heels, needing a swing of just 0.5%.
Labour, in third place, would need a swing of 2.1% to pass the Liberal
Democrats and 2.6% to overtake the Tories.
Last night, however, Labour did well enough to take both seats. It
scored a net 17.28% swing from Tories and also a net 5.61% switch from
the Liberal Democrats.

UP to 500 council staff at Lambeth have been guilty of fraud,
according to an independent inquiry set up by the London borough.
Nepotism was also found to be widespread.
Miss Elizabeth Appleby QC, who conducted the inquiry, said the council
was now ''in an appalling financial and administrative mess, with
non-existent or incompetent management''.
Her report, one of the most damning ever produced on town hall
corruption, makes no recommendations for prosecutions, saying there is
insufficient evidence to bring any new cases to trial.
Since 1993, when the inquiry was set up, there have been 90
prosecutions and 10 other cases of disciplinary action.
Lambeth was one the most notorious of the so-called ''loony left''
councils in the 1980s. The Labour group lost control in elections last
year and the council is now hung.
Miss Appleby said that, by last October, the council was owed #200m in
arrears for council tax, community charge, rates, rents, temporary
accommodation, and mortgage arrears.
She said: ''This is an appalling record and appalling mismanagement.
There is no justification or acceptable explanation as to why Lambeth is
in such a bad financial state.''
Over the past few months, three directors, including the finance
director, have been suspended and had disciplinary proceedings started
against them.
Lambeth's Labour rulers were too busy waging war on Government
policies to sort out the problems. There was an unwritten policy of
undermining the collection of rents, poll tax, and council tax.
Environment Secretary John Gummer said the report was a ''damning
indictment'' of Labour's record in Lambeth.
''The report scotches the myth, perpetuated by Labour, that Lambeth's
problems are a result of Government under-funding,'' he said.
''It is yet another example of the nature of Real Labour in power in
local government.''
The Shadow Environment Secretary, Mr Frank Dobson, joined in the
condemnation of the Labour councillors and called for a change in the
law to give the Government powers to ''step in and stop the rot'' in
badly run local authorities.
He said: ''On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this hard-hitting
and important report. It reveals a scandalous catalogue of shocking
failure by Lambeth Borough Council over a long period of time.
''There is no excuse for what went on. Waste and incompetence cannot
be tolerated . . . money was squandered, rent and tax were not
collected, poor management wasn't just tolerated, it was encouraged.
''What happened in Lambeth was a disgrace for everybody concerned,
including the Labour councillors then in charge of the council. It must
never be allowed to happen again.''

NEW security measures will be introduced this winter in a bid to
defeat egg thieves who are threatening the successful reintroduction of
ospreys to Scotland.
Now that the breeding season is over and all three osprey chicks have
flown the nest at the RSPB's Boat of Garten site this week, experts are
preparing themselves for a new round in the battle against the nest
raiders.
There were celebrations this summer when, for the first time since
1988, all three eggs in the nest produced chicks.
But the jubilation was tinged with anger, Mr Richard Thaxton, RSPB
warden at the site, revealed yesterday. The RSPB's annual ''hatching
party'' was deflated by robberies at secret osprey nests for the first
time in four years.
Last year there were 95 breeding pairs of ospreys in Scotland -- the
highest number for 250 years -- and it is hoped the number will reach
the 100 mark when all the records are collated.
But this spring, six nests were hit by a gang, believed to be from
England, and around 18 eggs stolen from nests near Inverness, in
Strathspey, and in Perthshire.
It angered bird expert Roy Dennis, who has played a significant role
in the reintroduction of the osprey by building artificial nests in
secret locations to give the ospreys a safe and secure place to breed.
Ospreys were wiped out in Scotland around the turn of the century by
the actions of egg thieves, collectors, and those who felt the birds
were in conflict with the fishing industry.
Mr Dennis said: ''It's been something like four or five years since we
have had robberies and we had thought that people were starting to give
the ospreys a chance. It is just disgusting. The eggs have no financial
value.''
Mr Thaxton added: ''Unfortunately we are unable to protect all the
nests. All we can do is appeal to the public to be our spies and alert
us of suspicious cars in rural and remote areas.
''But although there are now more nests for the thieves to raid, we do
not feel there will be long-term damage to the osprey. We will be trying
extra protection for the more vulnerable nests in an effort to defeat
the thieves.''
Operation Osprey was launched in 1959 after a pair were spotted
nesting in Strathspey en route from Scandinavia to Africa.

SCOTTISH Opera was facing the threat of industrial action last night
after management imposed a wage freeze on the opera's chorus.
The 34 full-time chorus members have been balloted on action and the
result will be known on Monday. However, an official of Equity, the
British Actors' association, said last night he was confident that the
ballot would favour action.
Should the threat materialise, the first casualty could be two
performances of Dvorak's The Jacobin, which Scottish Opera is scheduled
to give at the Edinburgh Festival.
The Equity spokesman said: ''Compared with the Welsh and English
national operas and Covent Garden, Scottish Opera gets its opera on the
cheap. Some of the chorus members are on family credit. On average, they
earn about #10,000 a year.''
The spokesman said they had put forward a modest claim which would
have cost Scottish Opera #42,000, less than half of one percent of its
total budget, to take members ''to the bottom-line wages of the
orchestra''. But management's response had been to impose a pay freeze.
The disaffected chorus went to the brink of industrial chaos last year
over a pay offer of 2.4%. A strike was averted at the last minute after
intervention by conciliation service Acas led to members accepting a
revised pay offer of #8 a week and a one-off payment of #300.
Central to a deal was an agreement that a working party be set up to
attempt to ensure that any future negotiations could be resolved without
taking the chorus so close to industrial action.
However, the Equity spokesman said none of the working party's
recommendations had been implemented and this was the second bone of
contention which had led them to ballot members.
Earlier this year, the joint working party report said that among
choruses, that of Scottish Opera was the lowest paid in real terms while
it was substantially underpaid in comparison with its orchestra. It
recommended that the board address these matters.
It also said: ''This JWP has uncovered problems in the relationship
between the management and chorus of SO. It therefore recommends that
mechanisms by which these problems might be identified and addressed are
explored and implemented on every level as a matter of urgency.''
However, the Equity spokesman said, the chorus's expectations that
something would happen had been dashed. While the board had accepted the
findings, it had not implemented them. ''Our members are incensed. If
the board agreed to them, why can't it implement them?'' he said.
Last night, Mr Richard Jarman, Scottish Opera's general director,
said: ''The financial difficulties facing Scottish Opera are common to
every arts organisation in Scotland. They are the result of continued
underfunding over a number of years despite the best efforts of local
government and the Scottish Arts Council.
''As a result, this pay freeze has applied to everyone in the company
and we are now planning on the basis of standstill funding for the
future.''
He said they hoped to be in a position to make the chorus's situation
a ''priority'' when the results of another working party set up by the
SAC were known in September.

<HEADLINE>Karadzic set for final fight Bosnian Serbs declare martial law as Croat troops pour across border</HEADLINE>

By our Foreign Staff
BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared a state of war last
night, mobilising all his troops as the Balkan conflict switched to the
west with Croat forces pouring across the border.
The United Nations fears the latest advance of up to 10,000 Bosnian
Croat and Croatian government troops risks starting a wider war in the
region which could include Serbia itself.
The self-styled Republic of Serb Krajina in Croatia also declared
martial law last night. It said ''the decision to declare the state of
war was adopted because of . . . Croatia's continuous threats''.
It was the first time in the three-year-old conflict in Bosnia that Mr
Karadzic had met demands by the Bosnian Serb army and proclaimed martial
law across the territory the Serbs control. He had even risked a serious
rift with his army commander, General Ratko Mladic, on the issue.
Mr Karadzic said the aim was ''reaching the final victory over our
enemy and ending the war''.
It seemed an empty boast. Although in the east, the Bosnian Serbs had
swept all before them, capturing the UN safe havens of Srebrenica and
Zepa, last night in the western region, the Croats held sway.
Croat forces poured across Bosnia's western border and cut a key
supply route to rebel Serbs, and the Croatian army commander vowed to
come to the aid of the embattled Bihac enclave.
Their advances captured two strategic towns. The Croatian victory at
Grahovo cut the main supply link between rebel Serbs in Croatia and
their brothers-in-arms in Bosnia. Whoever controls the town controls the
supply road to Knin, the Croatian Serbs' self-proclaimed capital.
Later Croats took the town of Glamoc, and claimed 20,000 civilians
were on the run.
Croatia and Bosnia had agreed to increase military co-operation in the
face of world failure to stop the Bosnian Serbs.
The Croatian involvement in Bosnia threatens to reignite war in
Croatia and blur the border between the two former Yugoslav republics.
It was in this area the Balkan conflict first erupted. The rebel
Krajina Serbs captured about one-third of Croatian territory in a six
month war in 1991. They are now fighting inside Bosnia, helping Bosnian
Serbs in their assault on the Muslim enclave of Bihac.
The separatist Krajina enclave comprises about 17% of Croatia,
wrapping like a boomerang around the north-west border of Bosnia with
Bihac nestled in its hollow.
To complicate the issue, Bihac is also under attack from rebel Muslims
led by a warlord, Fikret Abdic.
It was in the face of these attacks that Mr Karadzic made his
proclamation last night. ''Ministries and all other organs of the state
are obliged to strictly carry out the decision on general mobilisation
and ensure the armed forces necessary manpower and material conditions
for successful waging of war,'' his statement said.
He said in his proclamation that Croatia had carried out an act of
aggression against the Bosnian Serbs and the breakaway Croatian Serbs,
and that the Muslim-Croat federation aimed to ''destroy the Serb people
and their state.''
His statement followed reports that Croat forces were heading for
Knin, the stronghold of the Krajina Serbs.
The problem for the Serbs is that the Srebrenica and Zepa campaigns in
the east were led by General Mladic and tied down crack units that could
have been used in the west.
The Bosnian Serbs, enjoying uncontested supremacy in heavy firepower,
are chronically short of manpower. Even forced mobilisation in rump
Yugoslavia last month of up to 5000 men could not alleviate this,
diplomats said.
''The Srebrenica and Zepa campaigns were a pushover for the Serbs. The
battle theatre in north and west Bosnia is a different matter
altogether,'' a Western diplomat in Belgrade said.
''The Bihac campaign could easily prove to be the turning point of the
war. If the Serbs take it, then Serb Krajina is secure. If they lose,
then Krajina is also lost.
''But the Serbs have taken too long in grabbing Bihac and now the
Croatian army has joined the fray and could tip the balance which even
Bosnian Serb mobilisation may not be enough to counter. The 'state of
war' decision may have come just a little bit too late.''
Meanwhile Bosnian Serb forces shelled an aid convoy near Sarajevo, the
United Nations said.
The convoy was hit by mortar fire as it crossed a bridge linking the
Sarajevo suburb of Butmir with Hrasnica, south of the city's airport, to
pick up supplies.
One truck blazed fiercely throughout the afternoon witnesses said, and
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gerard Dubois said at least three more
vehicles were damaged by shrapnel.
The UN said there were no casualties.
Despite this attack, the big guns of the Rapid Reaction Force dug in
on Mount Igman, overlooking Sarajevo, have deterred Serb attacks on the
UN without firing a shot, according to their French commanding officer.
Brigadier-General Andre Soubirou told a news conference that France
was sending more heavy artillery and tanks to boost the Force's ability
to defend UN convoys and personnel.
Eight French 155mm guns and a squadron of tanks will join 12 British
Army 105mm guns dug into fields on Mount Igman, bringing the effective
range of the Force's ability to respond up from 10.5 miles to 15.5
miles.
The British guns, which together can fire 72 rounds a minute, have
halted attacks on UN convoys on the exposed Mount Igman road and
effectively forced the Serbs to let some aid through on roads they hold,
he said.
The elements of the multinational brigade deployed after two French
peacekeepers were killed by Serb shells last Saturday had also showed
their worth by halting a Serb attempt to capture a UN post on Thursday.
''Last night our mission to protect the UN was played with success and
by deterrence alone,'' General Soubirou said.
The general's aides described how three Serb armoured vehicles
approached within 30 yards of a French UN observation post east of
Igman.
A platoon of French legionnaires reinforced the observation post,
armoured vehicles arrived in the area in a show of strength and for the
first time since they arrived ammunition was stacked ready by the
British guns.
A Serb tank fired one 76mm shell that wounded a French UN soldier
before it retreated. Colonel Antoine LeCerf said the tank would have
been destroyed if it had remained in sight.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo is to visit Washington next week
for talks with key US political figures. The crisis in Bosnia, and the
efforts by the US Senate to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian
government, is expected to top the agenda.
* Scottish churches, trade unions, businessmen and political figures
last night mobilised support for the refugees and victims of Bosnia. The
Save the Bosnian People Campaign, formed earlier this week as an
alliance of business people and politicians, yesterday took the first
step to providing direct aid to the victims.
A cheque for #1000 raised by Glasgow business people was presented to
Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the STUC to assist its
special appeal to help coal miners and their families in the Tuzla
region of northern Bosnia.
