ELEANOR HOUGHTON finds student borrowing a necessary evil. . . but
post-graduation pay-back time casts a long shadow over career
aspirations
'I don't like being in debt but, frankly, I don't really notice the
repayments'
NEITHER a borrower nor a lender be. Polonius's words to his
university-bound son were considered good advice for centuries. Then
came student loans. They were introduced by the Government in 1990 to
supplement the student grant which was frozen in 1989. As the graph
shows, the amount which can be borrowed has increased every year since
then. In 1993 the Government resolved to reduce the grant over three
years so that by 1996/97 the value of grants and loans will be the same.
At first, the whole scheme was opposed by students' representatives,
such as the NUS, but it is now becoming clear that many students realise
they must contribute in some way to their own living costs. The debate
has moved on and is now concerned with the best way of doing this.
Looking at repayment of loans from the students' perspective is an
important part of this. Student loans have been around for four years
now, and for many past students it's payback time.
Chris Middleton was quite prepared to get into debt before he started
his Engineering degree. ''I knew my parents couldn't help out and the
grant's not enough to live on, so I was glad to get the money from
somewhere,'' he explained. ''It made me think twice about going to
university but I thought of debt as a necessary evil.''
But others are not so sanguine about being in debt. Helen Anderson,
who studied English and Theatre studies at Glasgow, worries about it
every day. She resents the constraints debt imposes on her future; debt
which, as a student, she had no choice but to incur. ''Having unpaid
debt makes it very difficult to make other financial commitments,'' she
says. Moreover, although she plans to train as an actress, she worries
that she is not free to choose this career because she will have to
re-pay sometime.
In fact, if she chooses a low-paying career she may never have to pay
back the money she borrowed. To make the scheme pallatable, the
Government established a ''safety net'' system when it introduced
Student Loans. Sir Eric Ash, the Student Loans Company's chief
executive, has described the repayment terms as ''extraordinarily
benign''.
Student Loans are interest-free, with repayment linked to inflation.
Students are not asked to start paying back loans until the April after
they finish their course. Even then this can be deferred if the student
earns below a threshold income level -- 85% of the national average --
currently #15,204 a year.
Once you start earning over the threshold, loans must be repayed
within a fixed period in monthly instalments. The repayment period for
up to four loans is five years, and for five or more loans is seven
years.
As an extra safety measure, the debt is written off after 25 years or
when you reach the age of 50. If you were over 40 when you last
borrowed, the debt stands until age 60. The debt is waived also if you
die.
However, it seems none of this stops students like Helen worrying.
Some graduates are repaying their loans before they have to. There are
no official figures for the number of graduates paying back loans
voluntarily, but research suggests it may be quite common. Helen is now
a postgraduate student and is unlikely to earn above the threshold for
some time, but she has been working a gruelling night-shift in a data
processing firm to try to clear her debts.
Jackie Pirie is another example. Although her income is slightly below
the repayment threshold, she has already begun to pay back the money she
borrowed while a student at the University of Abertay. Her reason is
simply that she doesn't like ''having debts hanging over my head''.
Because she graduated two years ago, when loans were smaller, she only
borrowed about #1200. She has a good job as a software engineer and
doesn't miss the #22-a-month repayments she has chosen to make.
Jackie's boyfriend Andy does earn enough to be over the income
threshold. ''I just think of it as another bill,'' he says. ''I don't
like being in debt but, frankly, I don't really notice the repayments.''
So although graduates do not like being in debt, it seems most are
finding repayment relatively painless. But these are people who do not
face the large sums borrowed by today's students. Already it is
estimated that a student who borrowed the maximum amount for four years
could face monthly repayments of #53.33 over five years -- more than
double Jackie's current payments. Once they earn above the threshold,
graduates must repay over the same period regardless of the amounts
borrowed and whether they earn just over #15,000 or over #100,000.
According to the Committe of Vice-Chancellors and Principles (CVCP),
this means that: ''Students face a disproportionate burden in the early
years of their careers.'' And of course, this will get worse as loan
amounts increase. The CVCP argues that it would be better for graduates
to negotiate monthly payments according to income and abolish the
''arbitrary'' repayment period of five years. The Government has
''undertaken to review'' loan repayment terms but is not committed to
either extending the repayment periods or raising the percentage
threshold.
But if monthly repayments become unmanageable, freezing the amount
which can be borrowed will not help overall levels of student debt. Many
students find they simply cannot stay in the black, even with a full
grant and loan, and have to borrow from other sources. Other lenders
usually charge very high rates of interest which must be payed
regardless of income.
When asked about student loans, Dave Milne, a Law graduate from
Edinburgh said ''No, I don't worry about them, but I do worry about a
lot my other debts. I wish the rest of the money I owe had the same
repayment terms.'' Chris Middleton, too, worries more about his other
debt than about his student loan. Both Chris and Dave agreed they would
not be in so much financial trouble if they had been able to borrow more
from the Student Loan Company.
In the absence of a living grant, it seems Government-administered
loans are preferable to other ways of borrowing. Most people still
disagree with loans in principle, but now that the worst of the outrage
has died down it seems Polonius has lost the battle.

A CERTAIN bejewelling and bedazzling is needed on bridal gowns in
winter, when brides can virtually rule out any added lustre being
bestowed from the heavens.
With only a crispness in the air making any sunshine merely steely
shafts, bridal gowns for the coming few months need a touch of
contrasting embroidery to be enlivened by the remaining light. Being all
bright in white is not enough.
At this time of year dressmakers and manufacturers really have to
display skills that go beyond tailoring into embroidery and decoration.
To be effective, a good gown needs more than a nice line and some lace.
It needs to be lifted up from under a potentially thunderous sky with
creative touches of colour and texture, playing off different features
and highlighting new areas.
In winter, bodices especially come into their own as platforms for
innovative designs. The recent vogue for medieval styles is still around
with a number of simpler crossover bodice designs making their mark in a
few collections, but this trend has also provided the stimulus for a
wider scale and variety of embroidery.
Piped and lace bodices are well represented in this winter's excellent
collection from Andrea Wilkin, and range from the medieval in style,
such as the Fresia design, which combines a bodice laced with gold cord
with crystal pleating, to more quaintly rural numbers such as its Aimee
design, which is pure Bo Peep with a plain silk contrasted sharply by an
underskirt and piping of deepest red on the bodice.
Complex embroideries and beading also draw the eye on other more
conventional bodices and gowns within the collection, creating a new
perspective on bridal gowns for brides who aspire to individuality and
subtlety.
Without a doubt, the colour for this subtle contrast and delineation
across the board and myriad companies is that magic word -- gold. All
that glitters is certainly not 16 or 22 carat, but a little golden glow
on bodice work can easily lift a gown which would otherwise be downcast
against a cloud-laden sky.
Again the inspiration for this trend has come from dabbling with
medieval styles. Other colours can and do appear on medieval styles,
from russet tones to sultry siren reds, but no other colour quite
conjures up the image of the queen in her castle and -- all is right in
her world -- as much as gold.
The incorporation of gold, however, has obviously moved on from just
those styles to a broad spectrum of bridal dresses to add a touch of
untainted majesty to many a gown. As well as embroidered spirals and
florals, ideas which are taking currency this winter include gold
braiding lightly edging bridal jackets and slivers of gold thread woven
through fabric to emanate a subtle lustre.
A major benefit, of course, of subtle touches of gold is that it is a
hue which sits well with a wide range of shades from ultra white, which
it softens, to creamier tones which it enhances. Likewise, gold looks
good against most Caucasian skins from those bedecked with freckles to
olive tones, although it can be harder to handle on a white base for
darker skin tones.
The right kind of blonde can find her hair is underlined to dramatic
effect.
Hardy annual silk and lace floral additions are another way to enliven
winter bridal gowns with colour and texture. Women who prefer overtly
feminine creations have always wafted towards floral additions, but
material flowers can also be used to offset essentially plain gowns in a
no-nonsense kind of way.
A simple bodice and wide skirt can be transformed with florals at
pivotal points such as the shoulders and at the top of a bustle.
Then, of course, for those who dare there is the opportunity to go
overboard with flowers making the running down V-panelled bodices or
stitched liberally over skirt lacing. Big blowsy and bold flowers are
their own statement and instantly recall hazy memories of sunlit days in
another country.
And when flowers take the lead on the gown they also set the score for
the veil, headband and of course the real bouquets -- affording brides
an easily attainable overall theme. Then the bridesmaids' gowns can take
their cue from the floral colours.
Going into winter, colours which work well on floral additions tend to
be lighter and more sophisticated than their summer counterparts in
shades such as tea-rose and buttermilk to offset but not shatter the
fragile light of the season. Occasionally darker tones such as damson
can be used to good effect, particularly on brunettes.
When it comes to the shape of these floral additions, you can pick
your plant from big round cabbage roses to tiny rosebuds and even poppy
styles this winter. A silken and lace nursery of blooms awaits.
Glistening pearls play with any quality of light at any time of year
and therefore pack a twinkle into any gown in winter. The Alfred Angelo
range -- which tends to display starrily romantic and glamourous styles
in its collections -- has a few new takes on decoration this year.

POLICE hunting a man who abducted and assaulted two Kirkcaldy
schoolgirls last week have issued a fresh appeal. They say that a blue
Ford Fiesta used in the incident had blue, furry front seats, a brown
rear seat cover, no head rests and no rear parcel shelf, and that the
man, aged between 22 and 25, had an L-shaped mark of freckles or moles
on his neck.

WHAT would you do if you won a couple of million on the lottery? Isn't
it what we all dream about? John Godber's latest turns out to be one of
his best for some time - a crisp little homily on the dangers of mammon
and much else besides, not least marriage.
Dramatically speaking, Godber used to be a near relative to Mike
Leigh. Now he's getting closer and closer to Ayckbourn which means his
characters still have the sting of caricature about them - it's a pretty
devastating portrait of the domestic life of the northern working class
- but with a compassionate underbelly.
Lucky Sods tells the saddening tale of ordinary couple, Morris, a
bored security guard and his sharp-tongued, slightly rejected wife Jean,
who suddenly finds the knack of winning the Lottery not once but several
times. Needless to say, their 'good luck' turns out to be of a
double-edged variety. Money, in fact, pushes them apart - or rather,
highlights the emotional chasm between them which Godber, in the very
first, very funny scene, indicates with livid accuracy.
But then, the whole thing has the stab of emotional truth about it,
from the envious, slighted relatives to the senile, bedridden mother to
Morris's old girl-friend taking him and his new-found affluence for a
ride. Godber's Hull Truck company, too, boasts some wonderfully
colourful, detailed performances from Iain Rogerson and Christine Cox as
the ill-starred Morris and Jean and Janet Dibley (stunning as Morris's
ex, Connie) and Nicholas Lane as the family relations from hell and
various other guises.

IF A FIRST IS NO LONGER A SAFE PASS TO A SAFE JOB, WHAT'S THE SECRET?
FRASER NELSON LOOKS AT WHAT EMPLOYERS LOOK FOR NOW
Q: ''What do you say to an Arts graduate?''
A: ''A Big Mac and Fries, please.''
* THIS joke has been doing the rounds on campus for decades, but is
now starting to lose its bite. It is based on the time-honoured
understanding that to do anything useful with a history degree, you need
a Tardis.
But over the last few years, the employment market has been
revolutionised. Employment is now anyone's game -- medieval historians
are becoming merchant bankers, chemists are becoming politicians and
lawyers are making the sandwiches.
This is the aftermath of the education revolution. Where once the
high-flyers were those who managed straights As throughout university,
these people are today finding themselves on the shelf. Today's
employers are looking far beyond the academic course.
''We are simply not looking for students with first-class degrees,''
says Sue Saddler from the much-sought-after graduate recruiters, Marks &amp;
Spencer. ''If someone applied to us who has studied hard, achieved good
results but didn't have time to do anything else, then frankly that's
not the sort of person we would want at Marks &amp; Spencer.''
She has separate criteria, echoed in almost every recruitment office
in the country. ''We need people with leadership skills, powers of
analysis, quick decision makers, and people who can cope under pressure.
Nowadays, to get as far as a first interview, students will need to have
solid examples of all of the above. We need people who can juggle lots
of balls in the air.''
So, to succeed in today's labour market, students must spend their
time at university not with their heads in books but in search of balls
with which to juggle. This is worth bearing in mind when carving up a
four-year plan. Students react differently to this: some go taking on as
many irrelevant positions in obscure societies as they can, in search of
a golden CV. But that method of predatory job-hunting is also a relic of
the past. To get ahead in 1999, the job hunter has to be much more
subtle, as Saatchi and Saatchi's Paul Arnold explains:
''We get 1000 applications for around six or seven places. To tell the
truth, they could all probably do the job, but we're out to be
impressed. It doesn't work any more to have a string of presidencies of
various clubs under your belt. This would have been impressive three or
four years ago, but it's run of the mill in 1995. We're looking for the
sort of person who has had a good idea and has actually done something
about it.
''This is what separates the successes from the rest: we all have good
ideas but very few of us follow them through. It could be anything. If
we find someone who has raised funds to take disabled children across
the Alps, it shows all the qualities we're looking for.''
So, if you have a first-class degree and little else, it's no good.
Equally, if you have been president of a society but merely followed in
someone's footsteps, you would find difficulty impressing Saatchi and
Saatchi. The leaders of tomorrow can no longer be found in the student
union's debating chambers, but spending a summer in an Israeli kibbutz.
* THE NEW LABOUR market is both good news and bad news for students.
The good news is that no one is pidgeon-holed by his or her choice of
subject. Employers seldom care what you did, and only a few care how you
did it. The irony of this is not lost on Paul Graham, who turned down
literature for accountancy purely to enhance his employment chances. ''I
find that I may as well not have bothered,'' he confesses. ''The idea of
a vocational degree has gone out of the window.''
So, then, has the joke about Arts students. ''Discipline mobility'',
as it is known, has never been greater, as Anderson Consulting's
graduate recrtuitment manager Sam Clark confirms. ''We're as interested
in computer studies students as we are in archaeologists. What we're
after is people who are bright, lively and interested in the job. CVs
help only if they illustrate those criteria.''
The bad news is that university life is now a lot more difficult. Not
because the workload has been increased, but because students are
finding themselves in the position where what they do on holiday is more
important than what they do during term. If you spend a summer relaxing
at home when you could be working to support yourself, that will be held
in evidence against you at the interview.
''Employers now want to know what you did with every summer since you
left school'', explains Louise, who claims she only ''pulled herself
together'' in her third year. ''At the interview, they will ask you why
you didn't join any societies. You can't tell them that you were
probably still in bed.''
This means that students can no longer afford the privilidge of having
four years in a social abstraction. To bridge the ever-widening gap
between university and the real world, students must practise their
'inter-personal skills' in their lunch breaks.
Q: Why don't students open their curtains in the morning?
A: To give them something to do in the afternoon.
* THIS JOKE IS another relic of a forgotton age. Students who have any
plans to be high-flyers can ill afford the luxury of sleeping in until
afternoon Neighbours. The immortal caricature ''Student Grant'', coined
by student gospel Viz represents one side of the schizophrenic student
life in 1995. While the new labour market has produced switched-on
careerists, there are still just as many freeloaders who come to
university purely to enjoy the ''student lifestyle''. As The Herald
student survey shows, both types of students exist in almost equal
numbers.
James Tornos is one such freeloader. He views employment as the
beginning of the end of his life. ''The last thing I want is to wake up
one day with a wife, two kids and a mortgage. I'm in no rush to have
about 14 days' holiday a year and still be paying off my student loan.
I'm not going to jump on board the industrial conveyor-belt just yet.''
He has kept his head above water academically, but deeply resents
suggestions that he must get his CV together before it is too late.
''There's still life in me yet,'' he insists, ''What's the point of
going through education only to be spat out the other end in a pinstripe
suit?''
There are still many arguments for seeing university as time to enjoy
life before work begins with the rat race. But if you spend too long
relaxing, you won't be able to get into a pinstripe suit if you try.
Getting a job is a four-year operation that has to be kept in mind from
the first day at university. Work experience is now weighted by
employers as counting for twice the degree. For those wanting to get
ahead, Saatchi and Saatchi's Paul Arnold has some advice:
''Students should think of themselves as a baked beans can on a
supermarket shelf, because to the vast majority of employers that's
exactly what they are. What will make you stand out so that you will be
picked over the other cans? You must do something different with your
lives, and something that your CV will shout out.''
The last thing student freeloaders like James Tornos want to do is
think of themselves as a baked beans can. But it is this attitude which
separates him from the victors of tomorrow's job market.
Mariah Nicol graduated in Political Economy this year. Like 1,800
others, she applied to Mercury Communications' graduate trainee course,
and was one of 12 selected.
''At the interviews, I felt inadequate,'' she says. ''There were
plenty of students with much better CVs than mine -- people who had
travelled around much more, who had many more relevant qualifications. I
could say I was lucky, but there is more to it than luck. I think I got
the job because I really, really wanted it. I think always comes across.
I really enjoyed my time at uni, but I never lost sight of why I was
there.''

* Sarah Urquhart (21) gave up a top job selling ice-cream in Edinburgh
to join Herald Student after graduating from Glasgow. She is looking
forward to another year of poverty as a post-graduate journalism student
at Strathclyde. In the future, she hopes to lern how to spel.
* Jonathan Northcroft (24) is The Herald Fellow. He went to Edinburgh
university but finds the memory of those days receding faster than his

than #5. High scores on both taste and value-for-money fronts.
PUBS
STUDENT: Ma Camerons, Little Belmont Street. Tel 01224 644487.

lunches. Great choice of top-quality home-made burgers with exotic

Open Sun-Thurs 5pm-12am, Fri-Sat 5pm-1am.
The ultimate 'hot-date' place, the only students seen here are either
being fed by parents or seriously attempting to impress. There is no
better place in Dundee to do either -- Jah's boasts a superb range of
Indian and European cuisine.
VALUE: Chaska Indo-Pak Takeaway, High Street. Tel 01382-228248. Open
6pm-1am, seven days.
To all appearances, the Chaska is a standard post-pub donnar merchant,
but any resemblance to its rivals is misleading. Even its kebabs are
encased in fresh nan bread, baked before your eyes in a proper tandoori
oven, and the curries are better and taste fresher than any of Dundee's
more upmarket Indian restaurants. They also cost a fraction of the
price, and are available at a student discount.
PUBS
UPMARKET: The Parliamentary, Perth Road. Tel 01382 202658. Open
Mon-Sat 11am-12am, Sun 7am-11pm.
The Parliamentary is widely accepted as the best pub in Dundee. The
beer is as good and as varied as the talent. Huge, open surroundings
allow for maximum socialising. A drunken crawl away from the university.
Don't waste time seeking a better place to go on a Saturday. There isn't
one.
QUIET: The Fisherman, 12 Fort Street, Broughty Ferry. Tel 01382
775941. Open Mon-Sat 11am-12am, Sun 11.30am-12am.
A bit off the beaten track for Dundee and Abertay students, but for
variety there are many good pubs in Broughty Ferry. The Fisherman wins
national awards for its cask-conditioned beers and has a loyal core of
wrinkly regulars, who don't object to the numerous young people the
laid-back atmosphere and friendly bar-staff attract. A pub to make you
feel at peace with the world -- Aran jumpers and pipe optional.
LATE: Laing's Bar, 2 Roseangle. Tel 01382 221777. Open Sun-Thurs
11am-11.30pm, Fri/Sat 11am-1am.
The latest-licensed restaurant in Dundee if only you can get past the
surly bouncers. ''Regulars only tonight'', they will tell you, even if
you go there three or four times a week. But it's well worth braving
this just for the spectacular, landscaped beer garden. In summer it's a
paradise.
HAIRDRESSERS
WET CUT: McIntyres, Perth Road. Tel 01382-643200. Open Mon-Fri
9am-8pm, Sat 9am-4pm.
At #11.80 for a cut and blow dry, this is bit more expensive than the
Lionel Blair brigade but for students who actually care about their
hair, there's no alternative. Student discount 20%.
DRY CUT: Fellows, 2 Commercial Street. Tel 01382 322887. Open Mon-Fri
9am-4.30pm, Sat 9am-3.30pm.
''Or you could have a Lionel Blair cut like mine . . .'' No-fuss, good
value head-shavers. This place is clean, cheap and friendly. No
appointments. Take a good tabloid and you'll come out a fresher man.
Even if you're a woman.
PHOTOCOPIERS
The libraries of both universities have no real competition. #1 for 15
copies, six machines and relatively small queues -- but the day before
exams the rush builds up.
SECOND-HAND BOOKS
Both Dundee and Abertay universities organise internal second-hand
book-buying. Blackwells on Perth Road (tel 01382 322184) has a
second-hand book section and is open 9am-5.30pm Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri;
9am-5pm Wed and 9am-1pm Sat.

Victoria Street (0131 225 1721), West Nicholson Street (0131 667 2355).
Wobbly chairs, rickety tables and delicious portions of French food
make any Pierre Victoire the place that it is.
EXPENSIVE: Phenecia, 55 West Nicolson Street, Tel 0131 662-4493. Open
Mon-Sat 11am-6pm.
Has an inspired mix of North African/Mediteranian food for the
adventurous. Offers sublime Couscous Royale, but is priced for special
occasions. Like winning the lottery.
VALUE: Chinese Home Cooking, Argyle Place. Tel 0131-668-4946. Open
Sun-Thurs 5.30pm-11pm, Sun/Fri 5.30-11.30.
So small you have to wait outside until your table is ready, and the
service is, at best, idiosyncratic. But the food more than compensates.
Stocked with every Chinese meal you can imagine and some you can't. The
prices are modest, which should finally clinch it. Has been praised by
Elle magazine, but don't let that put you off.
PUBS
STUDENT: Oddfellows, 16 Forrest Road. Tel 0131 220 1816. Open Mon-Sat
11am-1am, Sun 12.30pm-11pm.
Lovingly known as 'Sadfellows' to its regulars, this magnetic student
haunt is one of the few to stock the ultra-potent Green Chartreuse. A
veritable Tardis, the small door opens up to thousands of students.
QUIET: The Canny Man, 237 Morningside Road. Tel 0131 4471484. Open
Mon-Sat 11am-12am, Sun 11.30am-11pm.
Paraphernalia galore in this famous Morningside Pub. It quite
inadvertantly has the cluttered, stuff-on-the-walls look that so many
establishments are now trying to create. Plenty of quiet corners and you
can even sit outside in the garage beyond the beer garden.
HAIRDRESSERS
WET CUT: Cheynes, branches at 3 Drumsheugh Place (0131 225 2234), 46
George Street (0131 220 0777), 57 South Bridge (0131 556 0108), and 45a
York Place (0131 558 1010).
You can visit some place with a witty pun in its title, or you can
spend a litte bit more and visit Cheynes. Guaranteed decent cuts, they
also have guaranteed early morning and late evening offers as long as
you ask for a stylist.
DRY CUT: Woods, 12 Drummond Street. Tel 0131 556 6716.
Spit-and-sawdust barbers, famous for its Woods' No 1. Possibly the

REPROGRAPHICS

Mon-Fri 9am-5.30pm, Sat 9.30am-5pm.

BOOKS
James Thin, South Bridge. Tel 0131 556 6743. Open Mon-Fri, 9am-10pm
(9.30am Tues), Sat 9.30am-5.30pm; Sun 11am-5pm.
Course books are said to be the third most expensive purchase a human
will make after a car and a mortgage. The second-hand section at James
Thin's finds a way around this, undercutting the full-whack price on
offer upstairs. Unless you arrived last month, forget about the library.
GLASGOW (central)
FOOD
CHEAP: The Horse Shoe Bar, 17 Drury Street. Tel 0141 221 3051. Meals
served all day.
Upstairs you'll find a three-course lunch which is good value for
money. Although the basic fare is slightly reminiscent of school
dinners, downstairs food is served all day with a value lunch for #2.40
(from 12pm-2.30).
MEDIUM: Pierre Victoire, 91 Miller Street. Tel 0141 221 7565. Meals
served Mon-Sat 12pm-3pm (evening 6pm-1am).

waiters, chill out in typically good PV's atmosphere over a three course
#4.95 lunch with hefty portions of French food.
EXPENSIVE: Rogano, 11 Exchange Place. Tel 0141 248 4055. Food served
in the bar 12pm-6pm.
Slightly more expensive but the starters are big enough for a light
lunch. Dissected tree table tops and sizeable hot chocolates make this
the perfect stop for that long lunch.
VALUE: McChuills Straight No Chaser, 40 High Street. Tel 0141 552
2135. Lunch served 12.30pm-3pm daily.
Lots of food at good value prices. Proper meals, baguettes and daily

PUBS
STUDENT: Blackfriars, 36 Bell Street. Tel 0141 552 5924. Open seven
days 11am-12am.
This student hang-out has a real ales and a wide selection of good
wines. Live jazz on a Saturday night is a bonus and gets you swinging.
QUIET: De Quinceys, 71 Renfield Street. Tel 0141 3339725. Open Mon-Fri
11am-12am, Sat 12pm-12am, Sun 7pm-11am.

pre/post cinema drink. Brahms and Liszt downstairs are available for a
busier, sweatier atmosphere.
HAIRDRESSERS
WET CUT: Rainbow Room International Academy, 24 Royal Exchange Square.
Tel 0141 2044460. Open Mon-Sat 7.30am-7.30pm.
At a mere #5-#9 per cut, the Rainbow Room Academy is well worth a
visit. To book just go into the main salon on Royal Exchange Square.
Heavenly head massage before each cut makes this a not-to-be-missed
bargain!
DRY CUT: City Barbers, 99 West Nile Street. Tel 0141 3327114. Open
Mon/Tues 8am-5.15pm, Wed-Fri 8am-5.30pm, Sat 8am-4pm.
With old boxing and football programmes on the wall and sport on the
TV, this is a must for all sporting fanatics. However, it's quick so
don't get too absorbed in a game -- your cut takes less than 10 minutes
-- even if there is a queue.
REPROGRAPHICS
Roland Butter, 112 George Street. Tel 0141 5521100.
For only 4p per copy this is dead cheap. What makes it even more of a
bargain is than it is in fact a sandwich shop. An opportunity for
simultaneously catching up with missed lectures and having lunch could
well reduce the time spent on campus to an absolute minimum.
SECOND-HAND BOOKS
ABC Educational Co, Telfer House, 74 Miller Street.
Here's a place where you can buy second-hand and sell third-hand
textbooks. A bargain system which saves pennies all round.
GLASGOW (west)
FOOD
CHEAP: Joe's Garage, Bank Street, Hillhead. Tel 0141 339 5407. Open
12pm-11pm.
#1.95 for two courses and a coffee more than makes up for the pot luck
on quality and sitting eight to a table for two. Service is so speedy
it's even possible to do lunch here in a one-hour break. Beware -- it
turns into a normal eaterie beyond 2pm.
MEDIUM: Shalimar, Gibson Street, Hillhead. Tel 0141 3396453. Open
12pm-2.30pm, 5pm-12am.
This has a buffet for #5.95 at lunchtime and #8.50 in the evening for
as much curry, korma, and rice as your stomach can stand. Take this once
a week and you only need feast on toast for the next seven days. Also
does 'Businessmen's Lunch' (ie, student lunch) at a reasonable price.
EXPENSIVE: The Ubiquitous Chip, Ashton Lane, Hillhead. Tel 0141
3345007. Open 12pm-2.15pm, 5.30pm -- last orders 10.45pm.
Allegedly named thus as it was the only retaurant in Glasgow not to
serve chips, this is only for really special treats to be paid for by
parents. It has a jungle-like atmosphere with lots of plants and running
water. Worth a look at least once for spotting minor Scottish media
celebrities.
VALUE: Di Maggios, Ruthven Lane, Hillhead. Tel 0141 3348560. Open
12pm-2.30pm, 5pm-12am.
Good-value food to be found down a lane beyond some sizeable potholes.
Provides some excellent pizza, pasta and delicious desserts at
reasonable prices. You will even feel justified in ordering a Coke to go
with your meal, as opposed to the usual ''I'm so poor I'll just have
tapwater'' cry, normally obligitory in the land of student eating.

Mon-Thurs 12pm-11pm; Fri, Sat 12am-12pm; Sun 12.30pm-11pm.
Good place to start any afternoon drinking sessions as it's

floors, thespians, and happy hour(s) on Friday from 5-7pm make this a
hot spot.

Mon-Thurs 11am-11pm, Fri 11am-12am, Sat 12pm-12am, Sun 12.30pm-11pm.
A lengthy pub spanning four rooms; the lowest one with long tables is
for those club and society drinking sessions. Serves its own ale brewed
next door, which can also be bought by the keg. With its adornment of
Scottish bric-a-brac and barmen in kilts, it's a must for any pub-crawl;
but if you're there for the evening, arrive early or its standing room
only.
QUIET: The Piano Bar, 383 Byres Road. Tel 0141 3398811. Open Mon-Sun,
12pm-11pm.
The child of the Grosvenor Hotel, charging about 20p extra a pint --

Sat/Sun 4pm-7pm for high teas.
For the very few St Andrews students who don't live within 10 minutes

cheaper than Tescos (ie, your kitchen which is probably where you'll be
having lunch).

PUBS
UPMARKET: The Central, 77 Market Street. Tel 01334-478296. Open
11am-11.30pm, seven days.

finishing their exams. A haven for the Yahs, which is fine if you're a
Yah.

* KNOWING about wine is impressive. Whether you can stretch to best
Bollinger or make do with a cheeky little Chateau deux-quatre-neuf from
Safeway, choosing with confidence always looks good.
In quest of this talent, never be afraid to ask advice. Staff in shops
like Oddbins know what they are talking about and won't laugh if you ask
for something under #3 to go with beans on toast; or even to take to
that paupers' party.
To make things a bit easier, we appointed a panel of dedicated tasters
who duly sampled a selection of wines kindly donated by Safeway and
Oddbins.
Unfortunately, price usually is a fairly good indicator of quality,
but there is a good choice of reasonable wines available for around #3
to #4. Within this price range there are a few tips which might help.
Cheap red wine is often better than cheap white. Red has a more robust
flavour which can disguise excess acidity to some extent, whereas any
hint of oxidation, which gives the wine a brownish tinge, is readily
apparent in white wine. If you prefer white stick to the upper end of
your budget and choose carefully, or opt for Lambrusco (such as Safeway
Lambrusco Bianco #2.59), described by our panel of tasters as ''sweet,
fizzy -- gets you trolleyed''.
In general ''New World wines'', from Australia, California and Chile,
come at a good price and are very palatable. All that sun means good
wine can be produced more cheaply. We tried Caliterra, a Chilean
Sauvignon Blanc (Oddbins, #3.99) which was ''crisp and slightly
fruity''. One panel member thought it would make ''an ideal seduction
wine: tastes expensive and slips down easily''.
Reliable favourites are red Australian Jacob's Creek (Safeway, #4.39)
and Californian Ernest and Julio Gallo Sauvignon Blanc (Safeway, #3.90).
South African wine is becoming more available, but is still tends to be
quite expensive. Two words on French wines: Muraroa Atoll. We didn't
taste any.
Eastern European wines are often, sad to say, best avoided if you plan
to drink them. Our panel thought Safeway's red Bulgarian Country Wine
(#2.79) might be OK to run your car on. ''Harsh. Can I taste Bulgarian
peasants' sweat?'' was one comment. ''Heading for a headache'' was
another.
For this price range, Oddbins recommended Mediterranean wines. Their
Navarra Agramont barrel-fermented Chardonnay (#4.19) was thought by one
taster to be ''fresh with peppery undertones'', while another asked:
''Am I tasting pine kitchens?'' However, it was generally agreed to be
''drinkable''. Safeway's Italian Bianco di Verona (#2.29) was more
universally popular. A recurring remark was simply ''Iced water'',
though one taster got carried away: ''Nice, melony, light and lovely''
she said, perhaps a sign we'd tasted too many.

<TEXT>
A LONG time ago students from the more remote areas of Scotland were
sent off to university with a sack of oatmeal and a barrel of salt
herring to sustain them during term. Auld fish and purridge is not on
the Government's menu for reducing public expenditure on undergraduate
maintenance, as far as we know, but dining at the Ritz is still out of
the question for most students. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean they
can't eat well.
For your delectation Herald Student presents a selection of recipes
which are cheap, made with readily-available ingredients, and don't
require state-of-the-art kitchenware. Bon appetit!
Pizza Scozese (makes one large pizza)
This includes a recipe for the base which uses yeast and must be made
in advance. A scone base can be baked immediately and is very filling,
but quite heavy. And of course, you can always buy ready-to-bake bases,
although they are more expensive.
Ingredients: base: 100g plain flour
1 packet ready-to-use yeast
pinch of salt
water -- add as required
2 tbsp olive oil
Mix all dry ingredients. Add water and 1 tbsp olive oil a little at a
time and work into mixture with hands until a moist dough is formed.
Leave to rise for several hours in a warm place (eg on top of a
boiler/radiator or next to a heater), then kneed until elastic. Roll out
to fit a greased baking tray. Brush top with remaining olive oil.
Topping: 1 small tin plum tomatoes
25g mozarella cheese
black pepper
salt to taste
2 tdsp dried oregano
Apply to base and bake for approx 30 mins at 250C/400F/Gas mark 7. Of
course, any topping can be added. There is no need for a tomato sauce,
and cheese should be sliced and added as a topping, not grated and piled
high. Mozarella is expensive, so any cheese will do instead --
Lancashire or Wensleydale are less greasy alternatives to Cheddar when
cooked. Try gorgonzola and pear on a plain base.
Tuna and Red Pepper Risotto (serves two)
A cheap alternative to pasta. Well worth buying Arborio rice for this.
Ingredients: XXg Italian Arborio Rice -- available in supermarkets
X water
1 tin tuna
1 small red pepper
1 vegetable stock cube
1 clove garlic
Boil water with stock cube and whole peeled, bruised clove of garlic.
Add rice, bring back to boil and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes
until water is absorbed or rice is soft but not mushy -- like pasta, it
should be al dente. Arborio rice has a sticky rice-pudding-like texture.
If you are having wine (red or white) with your meal or have the dregs
of a bottle left over, slosh some in. Meanwhile, fry tuna in its own oil
with chopped red pepper. Add to rice when ready. Remove garlic and
serve.

Can you change courses in mid-stream? The answer, says FRASER NELSON,
is . . .
AT THE end of each year, exam stress brings students to reflect on
three unanswerable mysteries -- Do we exist? . . . Why are we here? . .
. and: What on God's earth made me take this course?
The last question is usually the most difficult to fathom. Each
November, without any clear idea of what the course will entail,
students sign themselves up for subjects on the strength of a short
paragraph in a prospectus, and a few ideals. Beyond that, it is a leap
in the dark.
Without any first-hand experience, subject choice can be nothing more.
Most unversity subjects aren't available at school, so choosing Law,
Medicine, Quantum Physics etc can only be a gamble.
But, unlike our English counterparts, most Scottish students can
change their minds on arrival. Summer exam results can alter ideas about
your strengths, and those admitted to a faculty can change, immediately,
to any combination of subjects within it.
The same flexibility allows students to change courses up until four
weeks into the year. The true colours of a course can only be seen once
in the lecture theatre, with the reading and lecture lists in front of
you.
Throwing these lists away could be the worst mistake you make at
university. By looking at the line-up for the first term, Elaine
realised that her Product Design Engineering course was all maths and no
design: ''After the first week, I had waded through nine hours of
Engineering to get to two hours of Art. It seemed my idea of making Art
employable came at the price of double maths on a Monday morning. After
two weeks of that, I was offski.''
She changed to History of Art. ''It was a matter of being honest with
myself. What I really enjoyed was the Art -- and although the job
prospects are slimmer, it's better than spending my life doing something
I don't really enjoy.''
Elaine was lucky: If she had reached this conclusion two weeks later,
the option of changing would not be open, as Aberdeen University's
Admissions Officer Cheryl Croydon explains:
''After two weeks, a lot of ground has been covered. We are much more
reluctant to let students embark on a course if they've missed its
foundations. If a student decides that they're on the wrong course after
two weeks, they're pretty much stuck with it.''
Honesty is a bitter pill to swallow in the first few weeks of term.
Mark Ericson took psychology, for all the right reasons, but took too
long to accept two basic facts -- the lectures were at 9am and he was a
lazy git.
''My body clock never fully recovered from Freshers' Week. I ended up
going to about six lectures all year,'' he recalls, after eventually
passing the resit. ''I should have realised there was no point in
choosing a subject I was realistically never going to attend. But it's
the sort of consideration you'd never really take seriously.''
Changing from Medicine to Biology is straightforward, but it is almost
impossible to change to a subject that requires higher entrance
qualifications. In short, you can change down but not change up. ''We
are very aware of those using an offer in the clearing system as a back
door to a better subject,'' warns Cherly Croyden. ''The Scottish system
is flexible within the faculty, but changing from Divinity to
Microbiology would mean going through the admissions procedure just like
an UCAS application. It's not any easier.''
* THOSE FATHOMING their career choices at the top of the Library may
reflect back to the three false career gods: Parental Influence,
Careerism and a Romantic Ideal. John Mitchell took accountancy as part
of his father's 15-year plan for him. ''Dad is a realist. He pointed out
that the aim of a degree was to get a job. I went along with him, but
after a while I realised I was just taking my place on a commercial
conveyor belt.'' He dropped out, toyed with forestry and the Royal
Marines, and eventually landed back down to earth to do an Ordinary
degree in Economics.
Ditching a subject you enjoy for one which will get you a job can lead
to disaster, as Edinburgh University's Admissions Convenor Dr Margaret
Mackay explains:
''There are many subjects not linked to a job. It is vitally important
to study a subject you are genuinely interested in, or the four years
become very difficult. Moreover, employers are now looking at the
profile of the whole person, not just their discipline.''
But at the core of the majority of career choices, is the Romantic
Ideal. Despite the reams of brouchures containing career advice, it's
idols that finally clinch the course, as Dundee's Mary Houghton admitts:
''Law is an excellent course with rewarding prospects, but few
students make cold career-based calculations. I chose law because I've
been hooked on LA Law for years. It motivates me when I'm waist-deep in
statistics. LA Law is the light at the end of my tunnel. Sad, but
true.''
''It is impossible to visualise a career plan by looking at a
prospectus,'' agrees her course-mate Euan Morris. ''But fasciation with
anything from Stephen Hawkings to Rob Roy is a very reliable indicator.
Much more reliable than advice from the recesses of your parents'
memory.''
This method have its casualties, adds Euan. ''My little brother
watched Braveheart last week -- now he's hellbent on studying Scottish
history. He won't be so keen when he's revising the municipal reforms of
James II. Ha, ha, ha . . .''
But to Dr Mackay, no reason is a bad reason. ''The purpose of
university is to try things out. Exploring a subject on a whim is an
excellent education,'' she insists.
She hasn't seen Braveheart yet, but would not discourage Euan's
brother. ''Watching a film is in many ways the modern equivalent of
reading a book. It is as good a motive as any to explore a subject. If
Braveheart is going to prompt students to delve into Scottish history,
it will have served a fine purpose.''

PROMISES, PROMISES
* THE world is divided into four financial estates: the rich, the
moderately rich, the poor, and the student (writes FRASER NELSON).
While the first three earn, a student spends three to four years in a
financial vortex where his or her bank balance ranges ranges between
zero and -#500. So why are the high street banks climbing over
themselves to make friends with students and give them money for
nothing?
The theory is that a student is an investment. A bank will give you
free money, railcards, cinema tickets and as much plastic as you can fit
in your wallet to lure you under its wing -- on the assumption that,
after graduation when you are moderately rich with great prospects, you
will keep the same bank account. Sign up a fresher, they reckon, and
he/she will stay signed-up for life.
Well, maybe. Armed with your friendly Switch card, you can burst
through your overdraft limit as quickly as you can say Freshers' Week
hangover, and it is then -- soon, too soon -- that goodwill and promised
lifelong friendship evaporates and many banks begin to show their true
colours.
The worst will take the chance to charge you to the hilt, and words
like ''understanding students deserve . . .'' are quickly forgotten.
Overdraft letters, when issued, cost around 28p to produce. Charging
anything up to #25 for sending you one is simply not civilised.
Bad banks will argue that you must be careful never, ever to slip into
debt; but they simultaneously arm you with the means of doing so --
cheques, instant debit cards, etc.
As almost all banks are telling students this October, not all banks
are the same. Those that do not offer incentives claim they offer
''simply good banking''.
That, however, is a matter of the customer's opinion. What is our idea
of a good bank? Surely it's one that helps us over the thin ice and
doesn't try to take money from us when we're already sipping down the
vortex.
BANK USER'S GUIDE
* OPEN an account with a branch at the furthest point away from your
campus. Student branches are used to saying No to students who are
desperate. Other bank managers still have some sympathy.
* SAY you're on a law or medicine course. These produce high-earners
so, far from hounding you for money, the bank manager will be fetching
coffee for you if you don't invent an urgent appointment elsewhere.
* EVEN if you're happy with your current overdraft, ask for another
chunk until the end of the year. Don't be put off by being asked: ''When
and how will you pay the money back?'' Explain you really don't want it,
but you want even less to be a bother with unauthorised withdrawals.
Works every time.
* WHEN charged for an indiscretion, make use of the bank's
student-friendly slogan and ask them how this sqaures for charging over
a tenner for #1 over the limit. When in the bank, point out to staff
that they're your friends and that it says so on their jumpers.
* HAVE a handy reserve of lines to fend off charges: ''Five pounds is
a drop in the ocean to a multi-billion pound company like you! To me, it
is three lunches!'' Exclaimed in the presence of queueing customers,
this works a treat.
* NEVER use your Switch card in off-licences if you're thinking of
extending your overdraft. The words Victoria Wine - #43.22 on your bank
statement will not strengthen your case for ''living expenses''.
* WHEN you first get your cheque book, don't celebrate by writing your
friends #1000 cheques for a laugh. You never know when they might get
desperate.

* TESTS show that, five years after leaving uni, most graduates can
write everything they remember being taught on half a side of A4, writes
FRASER NELSON. This speaks volumes. With the exception of the vocational
courses, students don't actually need to know anything at all. It's all
for the sake of learning. The trick is not to remember but to pretend.
This is now a way of life for thousands of students. They shun
conventional study guides in search of how to do it all within a
fortnight. This requires cunning and resource, bringing to fruition
specialised study tecqniques designed to minimise the workload and leave
time for social life.
Rather unsurprisingly, these methods are not broadcast. We have
collected five tried and tested methods designed to give the best
results with the minimum amount of time -- and effort. If you plan
messing about all year until two weeks before your exams, this guide is
for you.
* AUTOMATIC COMPLIANCE
* The Theory: If we see a person in a suit, the psyche automatically
assumes they are responsible, etc. In the same vein, if you make an
allusion to a topic, writer or theorist in an exam, the marker will
automatically assume you know what you're talking about.
Step 1: Read a footnote to find the name of an obscure author
Step 2: Find a book written by the author and read the introduction
Step 3: Copy one or two quotes.
Step 4: Place them anywhere in the exam.
Result: Marker sees an obscure book reference, assumes wide reading.
Guarantees a pass at the very least.
* MINDMAPS: The student miracle.
* The Theory: The memory is naturally made up of cells which link to
more cells. To access our intelligence, we should learn in harmony with
the mind's natural storage system: ie, with a central point linked to
subsiduary points, linked to subsiduary points . . .
Reasons for use: Lectures bore students stupid. By taking notes,
students invariably bypass the intellect and write meaningless phrases.
Revision reveals a set of incoherent lists. The mind is hence lured into
a semi-hypnotic trance. Students will fall asleep after 18 minutes and
be experiencing REM after 40.
Method: Replace lined paper and biro with blank A4 and four-coloured
pen. When in lectures, omit detail and write summary trigger words in a
circle. Draw the links between this circle and periphery ideas.
Advantages: notes are colourful and interesting to read. The mind is
engaged throughout the lecture, as the links between the subjects are
not explicit. Notes are shorter as peripheral detail is left out.
Revision reveals the structure of the topic, so all that is needed to do
is flesh it out with facts.
* TOPIC PROBABILITY:
* The Theory: In a year course, you will be asked to write four essays
out of, say, 12 topics taught throughout the year. Examiners are not
very original and ask roughly the same questions each year, but as they
only look at last year's paper, they forget. It is here that the hustler
triumphs. By researching past papers, he/she can draw a frequency chart
of the examiner's favourite topics.
Advantages: Unlike national exams, university exams rest entirely on
the eccentricies of lecturers which are are utterly, utterly
predictable.
Method: Go to university library, list topics from 1995 exam, and make
a grid. Read the '94 paper and make a parallel grid, ticking recurring
topics. Continue until 1988, when a firm pattern should be established.
Your topics for the year are now selected.
Points: Done at the start of term, this can render unnecessary 70% of
the lectures. Better a complete set of one topic than one day from eight
topics.
* EXEMPTIONS: HOME BY APRIL
* The Theory: Examiners hate marking exams. So, if you average a
certain mark during the year, you get the rest of the year off.
The method: Work out what exemptions are based on (usually two essays
plus course test). Don't go to lectures, but work on the essays.
Advantages: Obvious. By doing a little at certain points in the year,
you avoid the herculean labour of learning one year's work in one week.
Also, if you get a full board of exemptions you can go home in April and
earn lots of money.
Disadvantages: Organisation wounds the pride of crammers. It involves
preplanning and acumen. Neither is on the agenda in first year as most
students are too busy getting drunk, preparing for an end-of-year rush.

* SOME unkind Neighbours viewers might suggest it would have taken a
freeze-frame and radio telescope to locate Kylie's cleavage, but for a
group of young men it became the biggest thing in their lives, writes
JONATHAN NORTHCROFT.
We're talking intra-mural sport, of course, that athletic twilight
zone where names speak volumes and deeds, more often than not, are
simply footnotes. Kylie's Cleavage FC strolled the gusty acres of
Edinburgh University's Peffermill sports ground, and those less
salubrious pitches around the city during my time at university in the
early part of this decade.
They were committed, valiant and not that good. Though it is now
defunct and the antipodean A-cup has since discovered silicone, the
moniker looms large in the memories of all those who played them.
For the uninitiated, intra-mural is non-establishment sport, a chance
for players to by-pass organised university clubs for reasons of
ability, commitment or simple dislike of those in the official set-ups.
Consequently team names say much about players' cavalier, even
renegade outlooks. BBC researcher David Dick recalls his six-a-side
team, Plop, which bestrode Stirling University football from 1990-94:
''Though we all had ability, none of us got on with the official
university team who took themselves very seriously. We formed our own
team and the name Plop really expressed what we were about. The
university lads couldn't get rid of us, simply could not flush us away.
Plus we were a very free-flowing outfit.''
But other titles have little in common with the teams to which they
are attatched. Among the Kylies' contemporaries, Pink Doorknobs sounded
soft, marshmallowy. They weren't. And the Pinks turned out to be a pack
of rabid ex-public schoolboys, programmed to snap Achilles and scramble
cruciate ligaments.
Conversely, Fish Fingers suggested something rather honest and
workaday but were instead the prima donna league champions, breadcrumbed
with arrogance.
Some names are deliberately ironic -- such as Malcolm XI (Edinburgh)
-- and some unintentionally so. Edinburgh University sports union
president Sam Seddon explains: ''I used to play for a hockey team called
Hackers. We actually cheated a bit and used more university club players
than the rest. Consequently we were more hacked against than hacking.''
Unfortunately, none of the gladiators who stepped out under Ms
Minogue's bijou banner could be contacted for this article; they are
probably now brokers or accountants, their loyalties owed to companies
with drab names based in forgettable locations.
But in the Space Wombles, the Young Boys of Beer (both Edinburgh), the
Lawrence of Arabia Allstars (Aberdeen) and Huey, Ralph and the Porcelain
Yodellers (Stirling), to name a few, their spirit lives on.
STOP PRESS POLITICAL CORRECTION
DUE to technical difficulties beyond our control (ie, the Herald
Student picture editor's intense academic interest in the anatomy of
antipodean wildlife) the apparently gratuitous picture above was
reproduced in error. At time of writing, it was too late to replace it
and we must therefore apologise for any offence cause to Ms Minogue or
any unappreciative reader. The picture editor has been severely
reprimanded and banished to Australia for wife . . . er, life. His
failure was to misunderstand the Editorial Board's Directive No VIII(b)
which intended to effect the illustration of Kylie's Cleavage THE TEAM;
not the actual phenomenon. Under the circumstances, it was felt there
was little option but to issue this contrite and grovelling statement in
the belief that our readers would appreciate our willingness to make a
full breast of it.

MORE graduates are finding that securing a first degree isn't enough
to get a job. Statistics confirm that a growing number are staying on in
higher education to undertake postgraduate study, particularly in
vocational areas.
Research remains an obvious option for those with degrees out of the
top drawer, especially in the sciences, which attract private funding
for PhD programmes. But taking shorter postgraduate, job-related courses
is becoming almost the norm for other graduates, particularly in the
arts and social science disciplines.
The trend is good for reducing graduate unemployment figures, but for
those choosing to continue in education things aren't so
straightforward.
The Students' Awards Authority Scotland (SAAS) makes about 3600
postgraduate awards a year and just under a third of these go to teacher
training courses. Every other postgraduate diploma course competes for a
share of the remaining awards.
Graduates in non-vocational areas face a choice between postgraduate
courses which are funded, such as teacher training, and those whose
costs they must meet themselves.
Julia, a philosophy and English language graduate, plumped for the
former. She is about to start a one-year, fully-funded information
technology course which she is embarking upon in the expectation that
the qualification will improve her employment prospects. ''Yes, I was
limited by my decision to apply for funded course, but I had no
choice,'' she says.
For those who choose unfunded courses, private funding from industry
or charitable trusts can be an option, although competition is fierce.
Parental support can be invaluable, but not all parents are willing, or
able, to help. And if the time-consuming search for funding is
fruitless, the alternative is self-funding. Like undergraduates,
full-time postgraduate students cannot claim social security allowances,
but unlike undergraduates, they are not eligible for student loans.
Perhaps in recognition of this anomaly, the Government has introduced
the Career Development Loan, which involves four major banks lending the
money.
Borrowers can take out a loan to cover 80% of their course fees plus a
sum for maintenance costs. The course must be approved and of a
vocational nature. A maximum of #8000 can be borrowed for the course.
The Government pays the interest on the loan for the duration of the
course, and for one month after completion. Repayment can be deferred
for a further five months on application to the bank if the borrower is
unemployed.
As the only means of funding available, CDLs make vocational training
possible for thousands of people each year, but the 80% fees limit can
be an obstacle to continuing students who do not have the remaining 20%.
Perhaps this is why only 20% of all CDLs were taken out by continuing
students last year. The remainder were taken by people in employment or
registered unemployed people, who qualify for loans covering 100% of
costs, up to #8000.
In addition, the short six-month ''interest holiday'' makes these
loans somewhat risky. If borrowers do not find a job within six months
of completing their course, they could be faced with high interest
repayments on very large sums.
Intelligent and motivated, Fiona Graham finished university with debt
and felt she could not guarantee to meet the conditions of a Career
Development Loan. As a result, she could not go on to study speech
therapy, which she saw as her vocation.
She simply could not afford it. But that prompts the obvious and vital
question: Can the country afford to go on losing the motivation of
people like her?

Football? Rugby? Forget them. Jonathan Northcroft sees more room for
glory in unlikely sporting pursuits like jolly-boat, octopush and korf
I PLAYED football for my university and we thought we were pretty good
-- to the point of hiring a professional coach and restricting our
diets, drinking and off-field ballwork before games. But if truth be
told we were rubbish -- at least in the wider scheme of things.
To us, epic failures to overcome the likes of Ormiston Primrose,
Muirhouse Viole(n)t and Civil Service Strollers bore a touch of romance
but it was hardly Champions' League stuff.
In fact, mainstream university sport, though still producing the odd
outstanding performer -- Brian McClair (Strathclyde University), Lindsey
Macdonald (Edinburgh) -- is long past the days when its standards
matched those of the best. Not since the Bannister era -- Roger was a
student at Oxford University when he ran the first four-minute mile --
have the institutions achieved something of genuine world class.
The real heroes of university sport these days are those who live the
maxim that it is a place at which to try anything. They surround us in
obscurity. That scrawny guy from the nine o'clock lecture? UK real
table-tennis No 2. The fat girl from the flat above? She won the Euro
toe wrestling bronze last year.
Like Clark Kents, these international stars remain anonymous, slipping
out of tutorials early to train for world championships, missing parties
to travel to national trials, pausing only the local phone box to don
their yo-yo glove, fingernail guard or whatever prosthetic their curious
pastime requires.
This, of course, is to do them a disservice. What we're talking about,
in most cases, are serious, honed althletes. It's just that in PC
parlance, they are differently trained.
Even snow-boarding these days is tame. Aberdeen University mature
student Paul Hamilton is a member of the institution's most successful
championship team. Heard of him? He is a Scottish bronze medallist -- at
the sport of Octopush.
For the non-cognescenti Octopush is a six-a-side game using metal
goals, wooden bats and a lead puck and is played on the floor at the
bottom of a swimming pool. It evolved in the 1950s as a way of keeping
Navy divers fit during winter months and, though non-contact, it's a
pretty gruelling affair.
''It's all about stamina and determination,'' says Hamilton. ''If the
goal is 10m away and you've run out of breath, you've just got to hold
on and go for it.
''There have been cases of people getting oxygen starvation. I've seen
a couple of broken fingers and at the Scottish champs last year a guy
got a puck coming through his mask which cut up his face a bit.
''But the worst is when someone's bat raps you on the knuckles. It's
excruciating.''
Like all whose jobs or pursuits are tinged by the absurd, these badges
of eccentricity are worn with pride by Hamilton. He recalls taking the
plunge fondly: ''I went along to a session at the uni diving club. At
the end, all these nutters appeared with bats and masks. I had to watch
for a while but then I decided to give it a try.''
Hamilton's classmates remain unaware of the champion in their midst.
He adds: ''When I describe what I do, they shake their heads. Generally,
Octopush is greeted with mild amusement. Nobody takes me that seriously.
''I know it will never be well known. You don't get any crowds at
games -- it's not really a spectator sport.''
Some pursuits are glad to avoid the mainstream of sports and the
hyper-competition which often attends them. Former Edinburgh student
John Johnson, whose university Ultimate Frisbee team came sixth in the
1993 UK championships says his sport thrives on its alternative
philosophy.
''Ultimate is based on the idea of spirit. You've got to play 'with
spirit' and can win prizes for it as well as for winning games,'' he
says.
Crucial to the ideal is the absence of referees. In the game, teams
score by passing the frisbee into an endzone, as in US Football, but
cannot run with the disc, as in Netball. To force a pass an opponent
shouts ''stall!'' and counts to ten during which the frisbee must be
released. Accordingly, much is taken on trust.
Johnson says: ''If you are used to playing with referees, it won't
work. Even in the world championships, where people have been known to
have huge bust-ups and argue points for 20 to 30 minutes, things get
sorted out. Otherwise the game can't go on.''
Though university peers often refused to equate Ultimate with sport,
Johnson saw this as no great loss.
He says: ''It's not in the nature of frisbee players to care whether
people think it a sport or not. Part of what kept me going in the game
is the relaxed, social atmosphere which surrounds it.''
Like Ultimate, where many of the top teams come from universities, the
institutions provide the fauna without which rare sports would become
extinct. Edinburgh University and St Andrew host Scotland's only two
Korfball clubs. An indoor eight-a-side game in which players shoot an
orb similar to a football into a wicker basket, it claims to be the only
mixed team game in the world.
At Glasgow university and Moray House there survives Scotland's only
participants in Shorinji-kempo, a 2000 year old defensive martial art
practised in pairs. It originated in India and was revived by a Japanese
historian during the Second World war.
However, sporting administrators are now questioning the value of
minority sports due to financial pressures. Edinburgh University sports
union president Sam Seddon points out that they are often very expensive
to fund, since teams have to travel great distances to find fellow
competitors. ''In the case of Korfball, Edinburgh play in the Northern
Area championships, which stretches all the way to Manchester. It costs
around #5000 a year for travel alone.''
Seddon welcomes the achievements of the club -- 12th in the European
championships in 1994 -- but adds: ''It all comes down to money. We
probably receive the highest sports union grant in Scotland but have the
most clubs and participants to support.
''We now have a blanket ban on new sports as we don't have the
facilities or pitches to support them.''
One senior sports administrator at Heriot-Watt university puts it more
bluntly: ''We have requests from time to time from students asking if we
can fund them to play this sport or that, but we feel that, with a
shrinking budget, keeping the 33 mainstream clubs going is doing well.''
Thus in many cases minority sportsmen are forced outside the
university structure to find support. Strathclyde student Stewart Bates
is a Scottish international at jolly-boats, a rowing event using 1930's
style crafts, now commonly found on boating lakes.
He raised interest for the event within the university rowing club but
has so far been unable to secure the time and funding for them to race
seriously and so continues jolly-boating for the Royal West club in
Greenock.
''I do it for love of the sport,'' he says. ''It's a sad rowing
addiction really. But it would be nice if there were more recognition
and public knowledge about it.''
But despite their troubles, while the desire to frisb, jolly-boat,
octopush and korf still beats, such pastimes will continue to creep into
the university fabric alongside the likes of football and rugby. And, as
any apologist of athletic obscurantum will tell you, the institutions
provided nurture for those established sports during their early days
Oh, and Edinburgh students be proud -- did you know your university
hot-air balloonists held the ''Classic Spurtle for Team Efficiency''
from 1993-4. They didn't put that one in the prospectus.

* MICHELLE FOWLER, EastEnders
* MATURE student Michelle (pictured here with screen father, Arthur
Fowler) dropped out of the University of Life and took a degree at the
University of Greater London instead. Overcoming a disadvantaged
background and the problems of single motherhood, she graduated
successfully, but with a Douglas Hurd (Third). Cue ''graduate
unemployment'' storyline but -- proof that it's personality that counts
-- our 'Chelle now has a good job down the Council.

* ANDY McDONALD, Coronation Street
* The Street had high hopes for Andy when he set out for Sheffield
University, but he gave it all up for love and a job in a supermarket.
As a management trainee, at least he wasn't stocking shelves, like most
graduates. But time and soap plots stand still for no man, and Andy was
soon without job or girlfriend. Taking solace in renewed studies, Andy
now commutes to university and works long hours to support himself at
the Rover's Return, where his boyish good looks easily won him a job as
barman.

STYLE is not about what you wear but how you wear it. It's not about
what label you have on your back or the price tag on your jeans, it's
about defining yourself articulately. It's not about being fashionable
and following current trends, it's about attitude and confidence.
Fashion changes with every season, style remains perennial.
Your student years are likely to be the only ones where you will have
the chance to be true to your own sense of style. Most of the factors
that inhibit style and expression -- excluding the obvious material ones
-- are entirely absent from student life.
There's no need to worry about the office manager's attitude to body
piercings, whether bleaching your hair is a sackable offence, whether
your clothing is appropriate for your position, whether your mates will
still talk to you if you wear make-up to the pub. These things don't
apply. Nobody cares. Being a student gives you the opportunity truly to
be yourself.
But it is an opportunity that is too easily squandered. Even in ivory
towers the pressures to conform to a particular image still apply and
the way you dress shouldn't just signify the bands you like, the friends
you have or the clubs you go to. Clothing is the most visual form of
self-expression. If being a student is about education, and education is
the development of character, then part of this evolution must be
learning to depict yourself indulgently and visually.
One of the things the Nineties has made clear is that dressing well is
not about the Eighties vision of designer-name clothes; today it's
primarily about dissection. Clothes should be worn creatively,
originally and unexpectedly. Look for what it is that makes you feel
good about yourself, be it extrovert colours or sedate tones, and make
that the focus of your dressing.
Style dictates that conformity is obsolete. Designer clothing can be
worn with second-hand tat, chain store with Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The clothes
pictured on these pages come from the designer end of the clothing
market, but expressing yourself with style decrees a form of sartorial
mixing and matching and one or two good-quality and original pieces will
allow you to make the most of a more affordable wardrobe.
Hair is also vitally important -- an integral part of you, rather than
just an adornment that can be taken on and off at will. A good haircut
should emphasise the shape of your face, of your head and, more
importantly, your personality. As part of your body it should reflect
your demeanour and disposition and, as such, it should be cut
creatively. This doesn't necessarily mean expensively. Vidal Sassoon,
who styled the hair for this article, will give students a cut in their
school for #5 and other salons offer similar services.
The best part of being a student is being given the freedom to learn
about yourself and to define yourself. Do it visually as well as on
paper and in what you say. Do it with style. Do it with attitude.

THAT'S NOT EVEN THE QUESTION FOR A GRANT SQUEEZED STUDENT
NOT all students watch TV and the reason is not always scholarly
fervour, writes ELEANOR HOUGHTON. As grants are squeezed, many students,
myself included, cannot afford even to rent a television. Perhaps this
trend is an indication of our poverty but, though students spend their
days in the pursuit of intellectual enrichment, who can measure the
mental anguish of television deprivation? It's not easy being excluded
from the club of TV-watchers.
Such is the all-embracing power of television, it is almost always
assumed to be a shared experience. ''Did you see EastEnders last
night?'' is an integral part of a normal conversation, in much the same
way as, say, talking about the weather might have been a century ago.
Moreover, supportive friends try to make up for tele-ignorance by
constant reference to missed viewing. At first, my response to these
persistent ''Did you see . . .'' openers was a mild ''Must have missed
it''. However, as the cold-turkey effects of TV withdrawal began to kick
in, a slightly crazed response emerged, capable of stopping any
conversation in its tracks:
''NO! I DIDN'T see it! I don't HAVE a TV!'
And don't expect to go round to friends for a quick fix of your
favourite show. TV-owners will infuriatingly switch off the set as soon
as you sit down, opting instead for conversation.
This kind of cultural isolation cannot fail to have consequences. In
an attempt to avoid these, at one point I tried to resurrect an ancient
black-and-white set. All this achieved was hours of staring at fuzzy
white snow, mentally constructing images of Coronation Street through
the blizzard.
A more sinister development was my compulsion to buy Hello! magazine
to satisfy my junk TV habit. And, instead of watching Neighbours, I
soothed away exam stress by listening to Radio 4's daily shipping
forecast.  Fortunately, I couldn't afford a car; otherwise I might have
had one of those nerdy ''I'm an Archers Addict'' car stickers by now.
The positive side should be lots of time for extra studying and
wholesome, improving pursuits such as reading books and newspapers. But
the truth is that the human brain needs a break every now and then.
Television is a pre-packed, no-fuss relaxation fix, but if it's not
there there are other ways to waste time.  I may have avoided the big
pay-out of buying a TV or large monthly rental instalments, not to
mention the licence fee, but what I saved I more than spent on phone
bills, cinema tickets and subscriptions to Hello!
Confession time: I like watching TV. I've passed the urban survival
test, but I'd like to come in from the cold now, please.

Clean Break or Big Commitment -- the choice can be agonising, says
ELEANOR HOUGHTON, when faced with all that New Talent
SALLY'S boyfriend dumped her just before he left for college. She was
still at school, and in the weeks before he left she felt, ''I could
sense he was becoming more distant and was thinking about making the
break. My natural instinct was to see him as often as possible before he
left. I used to go round to his friend's house, uninvited, when I knew
he was there, and generally became really clingy. Needless to say, he
soon got fed up of this and finished things early.''
Leaving a girlfriend or boyfriend behind at the start of university is
a common predicament. One of life's ironies is that the siren lure of
love is almost certain to succeed just when departure is imminent. Just
as prospective partners can scent desperation at a 100 paces and adopt
evasive action, so the opposite is true of a desire not to get involved.
When we most want to impress, we often make the mistake of trying too
hard, but when there's no pressure, being relaxed and acting naturally
is an unintentional aphrodisiac. That's why so many people have holiday
romances, after all.
Many people feel that with separation looming, positive action is the
best course, so they opt for the Clean Break solution. If by mutual
aggreement, this can be relatively painless and, indeed, has provided a
neat conclusion to many a faltering fling which might otherwise have
lingered pointlessly, as Jim and his girlfriend found out, ''leaving
home saved me from thinking up a reason to end it; but we both knew it
was over anyway''.
However, an imposed ending like this can seem rather clinical to some
people. The pressure of knowing that love will end a week on Thursday is
highly likely to strain a relationship to the point where it will die
through the natural causes of resentment, arguments and moodiness. This
is particularly true where the decision is not mutual, and one partner
would prefer to at least try to make it work.
Despite such problems, the short-term pain of starting afresh does
avoid complications which could crop up later. It's worth remembering
that university or college will be awash with new talent. Never again in
most people's lives do they meet so many like-minded, single young
people.
Many people see this as an incredible never-to-be-repeated opportunity
which should be embraced, and not resisted. Hence, numerous would-be
long-distance relationships falter at the first Freshers' Week free-beer
bonanza, when good intentions dissolve, and lovers find they can resist
anything except temptation.
The relationship carnage of the first few weeks can be an amusing
spectacle to bystanders. Lindsey comments: ''It seemed every girl in my
hall of residence came to uni fully equipped with a boyfriend from home
but, one by one, they were all traded in for a new model.''
For those determined to stick together, in mind if not always in body,
life settles into a weekly round of expensive telephone calls and
keenly-awaited letters. Sure, you can go out with your new-found
friends, but what if you miss that phone-call . . . ?
Long-distance couples often miss out on weekends altogether, as they
dash the length of the country to snatch two days of intense
togetherness. ''I wasted my first year running after my boyfriend who
was at another university,'' Natalie complains. ''I really regret it. My
social life is so much better since we split up.''
Of course, some people are happy for things to continue, but on a
cooler basis, with little contact during term, meeting up during the
holidays. When university separated him from his girlfriend, Andrew was
''quite happy'' enjoying himself. ''I found the lads accepted the fact I
wasn't chasing women all the time because I had a girlfriend somewhere
else. I made some good friendships with girls, too, because I wasn't
trying to score with them, and they knew I wasn't available. And I had
great holidays with my girlfriend -- the best of both worlds.''
Jenny's experience was completely different. ''I couldn't put my
emotions into compartments like that,'' she explains. ''For me it's all
or nothing, so my boyfriend and I have really tried to make it work for
us, by seeing each other as often as possible. Like Andrew, we have the
best of both worlds, and an extra set of friends, too. We go out
together with each other's friends at the weekend to make sure our lives
are completely integrated. Most long-term couples I know have no
personality when they are not together, but this way we are both forced
to have a life.''
So long-distance relationships can and do work for some couples. Some
factors seem to make it more likely that a relationship will last the
distance. University means a totally different lifestyle. Where only one
partner experiences change of this kind, an added stress is placed on
the relationship. For this reason, it is often couples who are apart but
both at university or college who survive. Most important is a couple's
commitment to each other, and this may be stronger if they have been
together for longer before separation. But, regardless of the length of
the relationship, the couple must be good friends.
Experiences like Andrew's and Jenny's show that sometimes being
together can mean being apart for long periods. And if, like Sally, you
end up on your own, it's a no-lose situation. University is just the
place to find solace. Just think of it as one big blind date -- arranged
by an enormous Dateline computer called UCAS.

SARAH URQUHART in praise of the passing daze
IN a recent performance, comedian Simon Bligh commented on the next
step after phoning in sick to work. ''You put down the phone and think:
Kilroy, Richard and Judy, Neighbours twice.'' For the student, this
thought process is not just reserved for a sickie -- it is a daily
occurence.
Student TV usually conjures up pictures of psychedelic ''yoof''
programming like The Word and Fantasy Football League. But Daytime TV,
with Judy Finnigan's beige suits and Dale Winton's manic pink-sweatered
contestants, was not made with students in mind; yet they make up a
large chunk of the viewers.
So what is the attraction of fashion problems and supermarket
gameshows to students? Sarah Cupples, studying at St Andrews, is a fan
of This Morning, presented by married couple and ultimate student heroes
Richard Madley and Judy Finnigan.
''It's lazy viewing -- they tell you what's coming up every ten
seconds, so it requires absolutely no attention span and very little
thought.'' Dawn Kofie, a student at Stirling University, agrees: ''It's
easy to watch disposable TV and helps you avoid work for a while.''
The attraction also differs from television aimed especially at the
yoof market. ''Programmes like The Word are self-consciously bad,
whereas morning television doesn't do it on purpose,'' claims Sarah.
Easy watching, work avoidance, escapism and boredom are all factors in
attracting a student audience. But out of four channels students all
tend to watch the same programmes. For an apparently mindless activity
there is definitely some type of choice being made. Both the BBC and ITV
run similar programmes at similar times. Good Morning with Anne and Nick
goes out at virtually the same time as This Morning with Richard and
Judy. Spot any similarities in the titles?
The formula is strikingly similar too. Agony aunts, cookery, human
interest features; yet for the discerning student Richard and Judy win
every time.
A spokesperson at This Morning sees its appeal in the magazine format
of the programme. ''Within the programme there are lots of different
elements, many of which appeal to students -- such as budget fashion.
There are also areas of universal interest such as health issues and
celebrity guests.''
Julie Cromwell, studying in Leeds, puts the attraction down to the
gossip factor. ''There's nothing better than sitting down and bitching
about them. Richard's just so greedy and Judy has got no style.''
Indeed, find a student who hasn't chatted about them in the library.
Remember the time Joan Collins told Judy she should try putting cucumber
on her eyes? Funny things always seem to happen on the show -- like the
time weather man Fred fell off the floating weather map into the Mersey
after someone disconnected Ireland.
It's just not the same on Good Morning. ''Anne and Nick are just like
your Mum and Dad,'' claims Sarah. ''It's much more fun to watch Judy
panicking in front of the camera than to watch Anne being all serious.''
Dawn agrees: ''There's a good rapport between Richard and Judy.''
Daytime TV isn't all about laughing at the presenters, though. Jill
Mclure, studying at Edinburgh University, thinks it has a much more
serious side. ''They do communicate a lot of problems. Life can get so
'party-party', but with Daytime TV you get a bit of touchdown and
reality; you see that there is more to life than being a student.''

* DAMIAN, Home and Away
* In Australian soaps, 'Uni' is a generally accepted euphemism for an
actor getting a better job. Plenty of intrepid souls have set out on the
road to higher understanding, but few have ever made it back. Damian,
however, has succeeded in breaking the mould, returning to attend to a
pregnant Selina. Is this proof that Australian universities are not, in
fact, sinister black holes? Or is it just a sophisticated plot device?

UNIVERSITY Union gigs have always been a traditional route to the top
for many of the best rock and pop bands. The most recent shining example
is REM. These four Georgians spent countless years toiling on the
American college circuit, before graduating with honours to the
mainstream big time, and are now one of the biggest stadium rock bands
in the world.
So who are the best bands currently doing the Scottish university
unions, and why? Herald Student spoke to the entertainments conveners
and organisers of the top Scots unis to find out who are the biggest
names on the 'varsity scene.
Dave Daly, of Glasgow University, listed his three most popular bands
as The Supernaturals, Dallas Motorcade, and Hard Body, while on the
other side of the city at Strathclyde University, Tony Kerr's
most-booked bands included the Radoos, Bosley, Spleen, and Slacker.
Edinburgh's Heriot Watt University is most frequented by -- according
to Charles Owen -- Papa's Magic Beard, Little Green Monkeys, and Joe
Capaldi's Jazz Quartet, while Buenos Hormell of Napier reckons The
Supernaturals and Bartok are the most popular with his students.
Meanwhile in Aberdeen, Bob Strange tells me that the most asked-for
acts are The Supernaturals, Khartoum Heroes, Dawntreaders, and Peptone.
St Andrews' student-friendly rock comes in the shape of Tartan
Amoebas, Exmachine, Uncle Bluebeef, and Onion, while the Beaver
Brothers, Bullet Head, Filter Jaw, and Doug James are the most popular
acts with Stirling students.
Throughout these lists, the most popular band seems to be Glasgow's
Supernaturals. In addition to doing their damndest to play at every
higher education facility in Scotland, they have also recently played
their own headlining gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, as well as enjoying
slots at Phoenix Festival and on the Caledonia stage at T in the Park.
Hailed by many as one of the greatest guitar pop bands currently
playing in Scotland, it is probably the most well-known independent
group in Scotland, and having sold out both its independently-produced
CDs, Sitting In The Sun and Let It Bleed.
Gerry McManus, the band's manager, tries to explain their amazing
popularity among students: ''I think part of it is that we don't care at
all, the boys in the band are very unpredictable -- we have three front
men and our keyboardist is, I think, mad.
''We have now built up a solid fanbase -- with more than 1000 people
on our mailing list north and south of the Border -- and most of these
are students who travel all over to see us.''
The band may be well established on the scene, but what are the
consequences of trying to mix a music career with a full-time degree
course? Supernaturals' keyboard player Ken McAlpine, who is studying
interior design at Napier University in Edinburgh, found it very hard.
''The rest of the band are based in Glasgow, so I have to travel
through from Edinburgh a lot, which is very time-consuming. My
university work has suffered quite badly this last year, as we are a
very hard-working band, travelling all over the country quite regularly.
''My lecturers last year actually mentioned this to me several times
and I got letters stating that my work was being badly affected by the
band work. Ironically, on the other side of the coin, everyone else in
the band keep complaining that I don't spend enough time musically. They
want me to pack in uni so I can concentrate full-time like them.
''The tensions will be the same this year as the band work is just as
great, and I need to do more research on projects, which I neglected
last year.''
Regarding the sensitive subject of money, which all students are
obviously concerned about, Ken says that he doesn't get to see any of
the cash which The Supernaturals make from touring and record sales, as
everything is put straight back into the band for recording and
expansion.
''We get expenses, which is good for me as I always have to travel to
Glasgow for rehearsals and recording, as well as normal travel costs for
the band.''
While The Supernaturals are established on the Scots scene, the new
band UGE are just starting out. With a line-up entirely of students from
different institutions, UGE have just begun to play university events
but feel they have a great future.
Guitarist Shady -- other band members have equally challenging names
such as Niki, Steak Pie (honest!), Epik, and DJ Edge -- speak
enthusiastically about the band. ''We have a very funky style. It is
very danceable and accessible but there's also some social comment in
Epik's rapping. It's a bit like Public Enemy but funkier.''
Shady -- aka Stephen Lawson -- studies music technology at Glasgow's
Stow College but, unlike Ken of The Supernaturals, finds there are no
tensions between his studies and his music.
''The lecturers and technicians who teach me are great. They're very
understanding. A lot of them know what I'm going through, and don't mind
me taking time off for rehearsals, which helps as the band want to have
a situation where we can be totally self-sufficient, with our own PA
system and the knowledge to use all the technology to its best.''
''At first we didn't see being a regularly playing band as a financial
possibility and the first series of gigs we played we lost money on
strings, PA use, that type of thing. However, thanks partly to my
studies we are a lot better organised.''
The band's DJ, MC Edge, who studies chemistry at Glasgow Caledonian
University, says: ''Music has always been a really big part of my life
and I find it very helpful when I am studying for exams. It is a respite
from studying, which I think actually makes my work better.
''Although the music and the band are very important to me, university
comes first. Fortunately the others understand that. That means that
when it comes to exam time, I will definitely cool it on the
rehearsals.''

'I was more nervous than a five-year-old going to school'
TOM SHIELDS returns to taste the red meat of knowledge with cheap veg
* BEING a mature is, for me, all about the pursuit of knowledge. And
cheap veg. More about the cheap veg later but first details of the
pursuit of knowledge.
I signed up three years ago to do a part-time degree in Spanish at
Strathclyde University, some 25 years after my first and not entirely
successful dalliance with that yoonie's engineering and mathematics
departments.
When the time came to attend the first class, I was more nervous than
a five-year-old going to primary school. I was put somewhat at ease by
realising that my young fellow students were even more nervous, and then
entirely so by the efforts of the lecturer, Juan Cristobal McIntyre.
Or John Christopher McIntyre as he is better known. Juan Cristobal
explained to the class that if he, a lad from New Stevenston in darkest
Lanarkshire, could end up with a rather decent Spanish accent, there was
hope for us all.
I looked around and saw that a number of the students were writing the
words ''New Stevenston'' and ''Lanarkshire'' in their new notepads with
their new pens recently purchased at the student union shop. Put your
pens away, Juan Cristobal ordered, you are here today to shout.
If you don't leave the class today with a sore jaw and a sore head, he
added, you're not doing it right. He then proceeded to have us bellow
our way through a long list of Spanish place names.
Some people weren't shouting loud enough. There may be a Spanish word
for whisper, said Juan Cristobal, but it is little known and rarely
used. After an hour of this you do indeed have a sore jaw from laughing
as well as shouting and you're on your way into the wonderful world of
Spanish.
It is perhaps invidious to single out Juan Cristobal from the many
excellent lecturers in Strathclyde's Spanish department but I will. He
has been inspirational to generations of students over the last 30 years
and has now opted to be two-thirds retired. His students are two-thirds
sorry that he is not around so much now and two-thirds happy for him
that he is able to get on with his own interests.
It can be difficult fitting the lecture hours required of a part-time
degree into a busy working week, but the rewards are immense. The time
at the university stimulates a mind that may have become one-track in
pursuit of a career. It is remarkably therapeutic to immerse yourself in
the intricacies of the pluperfect subjunctive or the vagaries of the two
verbs the Spanish have for ''to be'', and forget about the concerns of
your daily life.
It is also instructional to observe the young students. They are a
more serious bunch then we ever were. They are currently on the
receiving end of a raw deal which would have had us old revolutionaries
in Bastille-storming mood.
They have no grants worth speaking about. Many have to work full-time
to support themselves and study full-time. They do so, in the main, in a
cheerful and uncomplaining fashion.
One of the drawbacks of being a mature student is that everyone is so
polite. (''Look, professor, I've told you. Just call me Tom.'')
It is reassuring to find a classmate who is even greyer of beard and
advanced in years. Whenever I feel I'm getting too old for this academic
stuff, I think of the retired sea captain who is reputed to be doing a
thesis in the geography department. The subject is piracy in the South
Seas and it is based on his own experiences. I've never actually met the
ancient mariner but he remains a great exampe of what can be achieved by
us oldies.
But what about the cheap veg? I hear you ask. This is just one of the
side benefits of having a student card. Roots and Fruits in Great
Western Road, Glasgow, offer a 10% discount to students. I reckon if you
buy #40 of fruit and veg a week, you can cover the cost of your class
fees.
Then there is the student discount at most cinemas, the yoonie
swimming pool which you can use for 10p a session, and the other
sporting facilities available at low cost.
All this and the pursuit of knowledge, too.

SELLING FOOTBALL PROGRAMMES
* IN every city, there is a football ground, with thousands of fans
waiting to buy their favourite fanzine. Paying the pricely sum of about
#8 per hour, it is the ideal Saturday job. Nathaniel Lloyd (pictured
right) tried his luck outside Ibrox stadium. ''I thought I might get
some abuse because I was black, but if I got abuse, it was because I was
English. Some people. I just kept my mouth shut after that.''
* CID LINE-UPS
IF you're young, single and look like a criminal, you could earn a
fortune by standing in CID line-ups. At #20 per session, there are few
better ways to earn money. After the CID went round the halls for
volunteers, Anvar was earning a fortune. ''You've just got to look
scary. Asian women are in short supply, so it's a real earner for me. We
all try our hardest to get picked and look really evil. I just hope I
never get called up for a crime I actually committed, although the CID
wouldn't organise a line-up for stealing pint glasses. I hope.''
* DRUG TESTING
STUDENTS abuse their bodies in almost every conceivable way --
overburdening the liver, under-appreciating the vitamins, going short of
sleep, etc. So why not make a living out of it? Clinical research
hospitals pay students #600 per week. ''I stayed there during Easter to
revise,'' says Dundee student James Taylor. ''I took some anti-asthma
pills twice a day, and got my head down. They kept me indoors, so I got
straight As in my exams.'' James was still alive at the time of going to
press.
* NUDE MODELLING
EACH and every art school in the country needs students with no shame
to stand naked in front of a class of 19-year-olds. Rates range from #30
to #60 per hour, but good heating is not always guaranteed. Donald Ross
from St Andrews had no qualms. ''I was being paid for doing nothing . .
. my ideal job. It got a bit embarrassing if I got the horn, but hey,
it's art.'' Bodies in any condition are considered.
* PSYCHOLOGY TESTS
UNIVERSITIES are hives of sociological experimentation. They need
minds for menial memory games -- and pay handsomely. ''I was asked how I
felt about my kitchen utensils,'' says Edinburgh's Jamie Reid, ''and
exactly which emotions I attached to them. I told the guy that my
toaster represented a slick exterior while red-hot inside. God knows
what that says about me.''
* DRIVING THE UNION NIGHTBUS
THE only living organisms that can tolerate being in a bus with a load
of drunk students are sober students. For #3.10 per hour, the driver can
embark on a journey into the mysteries of human behaviour. ''It makes
you want to turn Morman,'' says Neil Duxbury. ''Seeing the lawyers and
doctors of tomorrow wheel each other about in supermarket trolleys. God
knows how anyone pulls in that state. I have a peuk bucket for
Saturdays. I don't get any extra for what misses it. Bloody students.''
PROFESSIONAL HUSSY
* ''IT WAS the worst job I've ever had,'' says Claire. ''It's the
closest I have ever come to being a prostitute.'' A cheap trip to
Tenerife provided Claire with an on-the-spot job offer -- as PR girl for
a dodgy nightclub. ''I had to stand outside the club and try to get guys
to come in by pretending to chat them up. All the other girls were so
tarty, they all looked like Pamela Anderson. Blonde hair, false
eyelashes and full make-up in raging heat. Eventually I just found the
most intellectual-looking guy and said: 'Look if you come in you get a
free drink and so do I. All the clubs are the same. I hate this job. I
want to go home.' And they would feel sorry for me and come in.'' You to
can earn around #1.50 per hour from such summertime fun.
KARAOKE WARMER-UPPER
* ALWAYS secretly yearned to vocalise at full belt in front of a room
of dazed admirers but never had the opportunity/break/talent? Well if
you're prepared to substitute dazed for half-cut, then the perfect job
awaits you: become a warm-up person for a Karaoke roadshow. ''I didn't
have any money to stay in Glasgow so I got this job as a barmaid at
home,'' says Fiona. ''The Karaoke of a Sunday evening was a big social
occasion at the Fox and Geese and the bar manager said I had to do a
couple of numbers to encourage everyone to get started, or I was sacked.
I really can't sing so we used to turn the Karaoke machine up so nobody
could hear me.''
THE SPERM DONOR
* FOR thosewilling to turn their hand to it, the bank which likes to
say ''Oh, yes'' pays out a fixed dividend for every deposit. Investors
can choose whether their currency is used for research or donor
purposes. ''It was a pretty grubby way to make a living,'' remembers
John Tuson who was paid ''#10 a squirt'' by Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
''It was also pretty tiring. Samples were once weekly and you weren't
allowed to ejaculate for 36 hours beforehand. Mine had to be in for
9.30am on Wednesdays, which meant I was up at what seemed like the crack
of dawn. I had to take my effort to a disgusting place at the hospital
where this horrible warty little man stuck it in a fridge with about 20
other samples. However, he didn't ask questions and it was cash in hand
-- a tenner for two minutes' work. Which must be one of the best rates
of pay around.'' John lasted two terms before getting a ''proper job''
in a bar.
MORGUE CLEANING
* THE classic student'scrap job is cleaning toilets. But there are
worse things to clean than toilets. A morgue, for instance.But to
Graham, it could have been worse. ''It was quite a good cleaning job
because all the supervisors were too scared to go down there, so you
could skive off and have lots of fag breaks,'' states our intrepid
cleaner. Duties include hosing down the marble slab where autopsies are
performed and buffing the floor. And the wages for such toil? ''Round
about #3 per hour, but no danger or gruesome money.''

SARAH URQUHART meets a few 'mature' bravehearts
MATURE students are seen by many as a species apart. Older, often with
a family, they appear to really want to study. But all students face the
same deadlines, the same queues for library books, and the same degree
exams. So is the life of a mature student really so different?
In many respects it seems to be. Many give up more than a dossy sixth
year at school to enter the poverty-stricken world of studenthood.
Financial security, for example.
At 29, Laura Smith gave up her job with the Strathclyde Regional Arts
Team to undertake a degree in European business management at Glasgow
Caledonian University. ''I was having a miserable time at work one day
so I decided to telephone some universities to find out what I would
need to get in. Caledonian University was the first one I called, and
within 10 minutes I had been offered a place.''
Four years ago, then aged 32, Peter Hastings was disillusioned with
his job as an engineer. He exchanged what he viewed as a lack of
prospects and money for a five-year dental degree at Glasgow University,
where he is about to enter his final year. ''I really didn't enjoy my
job at all. I was so keen to change that I handed in my notice on the
strength of my interview at Glasgow.''
For many potential mature students, gaining entry to further education
can present problems, however. ''Many have non-traditional
qualifications which can be a hindrance to them before they come to
university,'' claims Imelda Devlin, mature students' liason officer at
Strathclyde University in Glasgow.
Even with so-called ''traditional'' qualifications, entry can still be
problematical. At 27, Kim Esdale -- mother of five-year-old Hannah -- is
about to enter the third year of an honours history degree at Glasgow
University. The year before she began her degree she had to undertake
two access courses in the evening in order to gain entry.
''As it was over five years since I had sat my Highers, they were out
of date, so although I had stayed on to sixth year at school I still had
to do the course.'' This, however, was not a bad thing. ''I hadn't
studied for a long time and the course certainly prepared me for
university more than I might have been otherwise.''
Access for for mature students to further education is certainly
increasing. Dr Melvin Dalgarno is the director of the centre for
continuing education at Aberdeen University. ''Our centre aims to offer
guidance for those interested in returning to education. We run
pre-access and access courses and even have independent subject study
where students can undertake a course in a subject they are really
interested and ultimately may even be able to move up to degree level.''
Open-door policies like these are enabling more and more mature
students to go to university, according to Dr Dalgarno. ''The image of
universities is changing from that of a finishing school to something
serving the whole community.''
At Aberdeen University alone, the percentage of undergraduate mature
students has increased form 5% in 1984 to 30% in 1994/5, a trend
reproduced at universities across Scotland. Consequently many
higher-education establishments now have mature student clubs and
societies.
Moira Douglas is the Convenor of Strathclyde University Mature
Students Association. ''We aim to help mature students to settle down
and enjoy their time. They need an alternative support network to the
young peole who seem to flock around campus. Although there is a broad
cross-section of mature studets of different ages, they all share
similar problems which are different from the problems of a
school-leaver undergraduate.''
More serious financial difficulties is one such problem. ''The
decision to become a full-time student marks a big change in someone's
life and has big financial implications for them and their family.''
says Dr Dalgarno.
Imelda Devlin agrees. ''Many already have financial commitments when
they come and financial problems for mature students have certainely
increased recently, with the reduction of the mature students' allowance
in the November Budget.''
For Peter, Kim and Laura, money has been a big problem. Although
recent Government action has put financial restrictions on all students,
regardless of age, many mature students who come to university are under
special financial pressure. The idea of getting a student loan is not
always as straightforward to those at 30 as to an 18-year-old school
leaver. ''Many mature students may already have debts and mortgages, and
are well aware of the full implications of borrowing money'', claims
Laura. ''I don't think you'd find a mature student whose hand hasn't
hovered reluctantly over the dotted line on their loan agreement.''
Many also have family commitments which set them apart from other
students. For Kim, having a five-year-old daughter has meant she has had
to plan her time more efficiently than other students. ''I have to
juggle my commitments really well to make sure I spend enough time with
Hannah. It's hard as I have to look after her on my own, but in many
respects I think perhaps being a student has meant I have more
flexibility to see her than if I was working.''
Imelda Devlin sees the family aspect as very important. ''Being a
mature student will often change the relationship a student has with
their family,'' she says. ''They really have to learn how to manage
their time.''
For Moira Douglas, family commitments also set her apart from other
students. ''Younger students can study at 10pm at night. With three
children, I don't have that option.''
But if mature students are set apart by finacial and social
constraints, where is the justification for their image as studious
do-gooders, hidden away in the library from dawn to dusk and asserting
themselves in tutorials?
Laura does believe mature students are perceived to be hard workers.
''On my course, everyone always seems to think I'll know the answer,''
she says. ''Once, when I went to class having not done the preparation,
everyone else panicked because they had been relying on me to do it! But
it's true -- being older means you are on the course because you really,
really want to be. You're bound to work hard.''
Peter found himself working harder than his younger counterparts in
the early years of his degree. ''I did really want to do well. I think I
possibly felt I had something to prove.''
So with all these differences, it's no surprise that mature students
are viewed as a separate entity. But do they really have a hard time
socialising with 17-year-olds? Not according to Kim. ''I have a lot of
integration with younger people. To be honest, I think it's the mature
students who often take the initiative socially. I know that in
tutorials it'll often be me who suggests going out for a drink.''
Laura, too, enjoys an active social life with her course mates.
''Sometimes you get the impression that they are worried that if they
ask me out to a club I am going to need a Zimmer in the morning! But my
course mixes well together and there is a lot of integration.
''One girl on my course once asked me how I managed to have such an
active social life and still hand my essays in on time. I replied that
it was simply because she was 18 and I wasn't. Being that bit older
means you are a much better time manager and that makes a big
difference.''
In common with younger students, mature students have similar hopes
and aspirations for when they leave university. ''I don't believe I'll
have any trouble getting a job in dentistry when I finish,'' says Peter.
Kim, too, hopes for a well-paid job and better career prospects when she
finishes her degree. And Laura, like many students, is unsure what she
wants to do. ''I really feel that having given everything up to come to
university I'm not ready to make a decision about my future.
''A degree like mine doesn't qualify me for a job. I did it to point
me in a better direction than my old job.''

FRASER NELSON on the campus crusader's good fight . . . armed with tea
and scones
STANDING ALONE among the rabble of Freshers' Week is a Fresher with a
difference. In the flocks of Freshers being ushered from one pub to the
next, he is shouting: ''Tea and a Scone? Tea and a Scone?''
His name is Tim, and he is a Christian. He is not trying to sign
students up to a club or society but is out to win their souls. Tim is
pulling in the Freshers for God.
He has his work cut out for him. As Freshers are discovering the free
condom in their Fresher Pack, Tim is offering celibacy, guitars and the
Truth. He is aiming his scones at a new breed of student: a breed
described by his Christian quarterly, NB, as ''Generation X''. It
explains: ''They are people without hope without meaning and without
God. To Christians, they are the lost.''
But not to Father James Hill, Catholic chaplain of Glasgow University.
''Christians can't describe people as 'lost'. There are many ways to
Truth. Christianity is one of them, but we don't have a monopoly on
heaven.''
Tim most certainly disagrees. The Bible tells Tim that he is going to
heaven and that the ''lost'' are not. Neither are homosexuals, Muslims,
Buddists, non-believers and most certainly not the promiscuous. ''It's a
bitter pill to swallow,'' admits Tim, ''but Jesus and his way of life is
our only redemption. We can only forgiven through reading the Gospel. As
a group, we believe that every word in the Gospel is the Truth. Every
Christian does.''
One Christian who does not is Bishop Richard Holloway, Primate of the
Scottish Episcopalian Church. ''I don't see the Bible as a fax from God.
It's there to be thought about. God gave us a brain and wants us to use
it. Nor do I believe in the lurid medieval stories of Hell -- God
roasting people in some kind of eternal barbecue. The fundamental
Christian message is of love, forgiveness and toleration.
''Those people who claim to speak for Christianity as a whole are the
product of youthful arrogance.''
Holloway wishes there was a Trades Descriptions Act to distinguish
groups of Christians. ''I'm not knocking them, but they are just a
particular breed of Christians who haven't got a specific title.''
Yet they are the loudest voice of Christianity on campus, and they are
making themselves heard. A quick flick through Glasgow University's
handbook, however, reveals that other students have reservations.
''Religion is a personal thing,'' it warns, ''and anyone who tells you
otherwise should be sent on their way with a simple: ''Two things, okay:
-- Daid Koresh and the Waco seige.''
''A Radical obedience to Christ has never been well received,'' admits
the Christian Union's student guide, telling how two medieval student
evangelists were burned at the stake. ''But by spreading the Good News,
we reach the Garden of Eden.''
If the Garden of Eden is paradise for mankind, then halls of residence
are paradise for the evangelical Christian. Nowhere is there a higher
concentration of souls waiting to be saved. Tim is planning a ''Grill
the God Squad'' evening in halls where residents can put their questions
to people most of them see as complete lunatics.
''They put us down as weirdos at first,'' says Tim, but they want to
know about the gifts they can discover at university which are free --
forgiveness and love.''
Tim's idea of free love may be at odds with the more carnal versions
around in Freshers' Week, but judging by the number of people sitting in
Tim's University Crypt, there are many students who feel more
comfortable with tea and a scone than downing a Freshers Week pint in
under 20 seconds. Tim feels he will overcome.
''Tonight, we may get together, read extracts of the Gospel, and sing
a few songs on the guitar. It should be a very relaxing evening.''

Eleanor Houghton enters the brave new world ofcontinuous assessment
and computerised lectures
END-OF-YEAR exams are unpleasant, stressful, terrifying, and . . .out
of date. Already many Scottish universities have abolished academia's
ritual 100-yard dash. The once-yearly all-or-nothing degree exam is
being ditched in favour of a modular approach, where continuous
assessment means long-distance stamina.
Under the new system there are two semesters in every academic year
instead of the traditional three terms. Each module is examined at the
end of a semester. This means there are two sets of exams per year and
there is never a time when a student has to know a whole year's work at
once. Several Scottish universities have adopted this system, among them
Strathclyde and Aberdeen, while maintaining more or less the traditional
pattern of Christmas, Easter and summer holidays. Stirling has adopted
long winter an summer breaks and just a week off for Easter.
According to Professor Ian MacDonald, Vice Principal of Aberdeen
University, the ''Big Bang'' once-a-year exam may have had its day.
''There is no great virtue in students knowing everything at once,'' he
says. ''Swotting up a whole year's worth of information is not something
most students will have to do in their future careers.''
However, at a time when Education Secretary Gillian Shepherd has
ordered an inquiry into standards in higher education, Prof MacDonald is
aware of the dangers of what he calls a ''cafeteria'' system, where
modules are studied piece-meal without looking at the overall structure
of the degree.
''The advantage is flexibility,'' he explains. ''But as one of the
older universities, we have tried to maintain coherence, especially in
Honours.'' He argues that Aberdeen's semester-type modularised system
actually makes students work harder: ''It enables students to see the
rewards of their work and move on. We find course work is done more
thoroughly.''
But modularisation isn't the only movement for change in higher
education, and degree exams aren't the only student bugbear on the way
out. The dreaded 9 o'clock lecture could also be a thing of the past.
Computers and the Internet are being used more and more in
universities. With the recent expansion of the higher education sector
and the huge increase in student numbers, using computers to deliver
ready-made course material could be a way of maintaining high quality at
a time when resources are very much at a premium. At Heriot Watt
University, lecturers are alreay being encouraged to produce teaching
materials on computer disk as well as in reading packs. And, as part of
the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme, TLTP, the univesity has
developed its own software, known as ''courseware'', which can be use in
place of formal classes.
Vice Principal Professor Charles Brown predicts how this kind of
teaching could work in the future, when most people have access to
computers. ''In theory,'' he claims, ''a student could wake up in the
middle of the night and decide to go to a lecture, by simply going to
his computer and pulling the lecture he wants off the Intenet.
''In future, we hope that it will be possible to choose the best
course from anywhere in the world to make use of it here.'' This will
mean that the student can go through the material at his own pace. But
the most important thing, says Prof Brown, is that the student should
still have access to a member of staff. Professor Allison, a Vice
Principal of Glasgow University, agrees: ''We should be looking at
computers as a back-up to normal teaching methods. Personal staff
involvement will always be crucial.''
He points out there have been problems with modifying TLTP for use in
other institutions. And both Professors Brown and Allison agree that a
balance will have to be struck between sharing ready-made courses and
maintaining each university's originality.
Perhaps students shouldn't throw away their alarm clocks yet. The 9am
lecture may well linger awhile . . .

* MARK BAIN, fourth-year Computer Science student at Heriot Watt:
I WORKED with CALM (Computer Aided Maths Learning) in second year and
found it very helpful. I offered a good mix of teaching methods. You
could go through the course-work at our own pace and ask the tutor if
there were any problems. It was better than traditional methods where
there is a group of students competing for the tutor's attention. The
chances are that, if you get stuck, you'll get individual help while the
others carry on working on their computers.
* SARAH LOGAN, recent graduate in English and History from Aberdeen
University:
ABERDEEN has a modularised semester system, but holidays aren't much
different. The semester continues for two weeks after the Christmas
holidays, which gives time to get back into things before exams. It
meant I could party over the holidays without worrying about studying.
My sister at St Andrews will have nine scary Finals all at once at the
end of this year. Modules meant I never suffered this. Exams are at the
end of every semester and course work counts for 50%. I think it's
fairer.
* DAWN KOFIE, second-year English and Film &amp; TV student at Stirling
University:
STIRLING has a two-semester system. The main difference is that we
have a long break in the middle of winter when, if you haven't a job,
you have at least a month of sitting aroung watching TV and relying on
your parents for money. Working to semesters wouldn't be a problem if
other universities had the same system. You find all your friends from
home disappear back to university after three weeks, leaving you on your
own.

* HOW they see today's students and how they're going to convert them
-- extracts from the latest edition of the Christian Union Student's
quarterly, NB:
The era:
* ''Yuppies and hippies optimistically chose their lifestyles.
Generation X have simply retreated into theirs. Dissillusioned,
apathetic, adrift in a sea of relativity, Generation X long for a way
out. Therein is our dilemma and opportunity.''
The species:
* ''Generation X dance to deliberately monotonous music like U2. They
reminisce about children's television and space-hoppers, drinking to the
past. It's only the mid-90s and already student unions are holding 80s
discos!''
The method:
* ''Hard hit-and-run evangelism will spring off an Xer's cynicism like
water off a duck's back. We must use indirect methods, which can be
especially helpful in the pre-evangelistic softening of the soil. The
more personal and direct the evangelism, the more effective it will
be.''

'Once, I would like to see if I could be put back on the train sober'
He is an actor, novelist and comedian, and his favourite word is
''parper''. Stephen Fry is the rector every student dreams of: funny,
intelligent and, mosty surprisingly, devoted. Since his installation in
1992, his conscientious approach has astonished those who imagined that
his celebrity status would render him a mere figurehead. And since his
self-imposed exile in France, receiving his honorary degree from Dundee
University was the only appointment that drew him back to Britain. In
the only interview he has given since leaving for France, Stephen Fry
tells FRASER NELSON what makes him take the position so seriously, what
should be done with university education, and what exactly he means by
''parper''.
* Why are you taking the role of rector so seriously?
* Well, there doesn't seem much point in doing things by halves. This
belief has been both a blessing and a curse. I suppose I'm not saying
anything more interesting than ''If a thing's worth doing, it's worth
doing well''.
* What are your main priorities as rector?
* I tend to come up by sleeper from London and return on the evening
train. Once, just once, I would like to see if I could be put back on
the train sober. There seems to be a conspiracy among those who show me
around and look after me during the day. The other priorities resolve
arond trying to be sure that student quality of life in Dundee is as
high as any in the land. That Dundee students never need feel too much
pressure, academically financially or socially; that there are enough
people of good will and understanding in DUSA and among the teaching
staff to save students from the despair, fear, loneliness and worry
which can often accompany academic life.
* How do you define the role and responsibilities of rector of a
university?
* Well, I think they define themselves, really. You have to be there
to respond to whatever emerges. The crucual point about rectors is that
they are elected to serve the students. Not the university as a whole,
nor the staff, nor the court, but the students. I took an oath saying
that I would attempt to represent their interests to the best of my
abilities, and of course that involves a large number of different
areas. Some students have individual problems I try to address; on other
occasions the Students' Association will tell me about a general
problem, often to do with rental problems, accommodation facilities, and
so on.
* The role of rector is in many ways ceremonial. Does this put you
off?
* An old queen like me? I revel in ceremony. Well, really, the
ceremony has a kind of metaphorical function: by showing the Rector to
be a senior officer of the University, the institution is showing its
respect to student wishes. Their elected official is treated as an
integral part of the university. It's a trifle embarassing to be seen in
a cap and gown, but it's part of that whole respect element and
altogether no bad thing, really.
* Do you consider the role of rector a political position?
* Hmm. Tricky one. I think it's up to the students. My predecessor was
an SNP man and his election clearly showed an aspect of the political
thinking of the students. I doubt my election could be seen as a very
political statement. On the other hand, the issue of student welfare is
a nauturally political one and the fight for better conditions,
financial stability and a proper respect and status for students is
necessarily a political one.
* Scotland is one of the few countries to maintain the medieval
position of rector: do you consider it outdated in any way?
* Not at all; I feel sorry for those English universities which have
no equivalent.
* What do you enjoy most about being rector?
* Well, at the risk of sounding greasy and obvious, I suppose I will
have to come out with the old cliche -- ''meeting people''. I have, so
far, been shown around over 12 university departments, as well as
attending any number of student gatherings. A surprising number of
people my age just simply never get to meet those much younger than
themselves. I regard it as an elixir of youth; the nearer I am to the
young and sappy, the younger and sappier I'll remain myself.
* Is it unusual for an English novelist and comedian to be elected to
be rector of a Scottish University
* Not so unusual as to be embarassing. My predecessors, Peter Ustinov
and Clement Freud, had similarly various, non-Scottish backgrounds.
* Do you think there is a danger of electing ''novelty'' rectors to a
position which requires so much time and attention?
* It's up to the students, really, to choose people who really might
have the motivation and desire to do more than show up for installation.
If the students really want a Winnie Mandela who'll never show up, then
there's nothing to stop them; there's no reason, however, why a
musician, actor, disc jockey or whoever might not be a huge success.
* Celebrities must have much to do; even before you were rector people
were saying that you took on so much, there must be two of you. Why add
another burden to your life by being a working rector?
* My, that's a good question. A damned good question. I can't really
think of an answer to that. I suppose the more different things one can
do, the more fun one will have. One of the pleasing aspects about the
''celebrity'' thing is that one does get asked to do things that
otherwise would never come one's way. Why turn them down?
* What fuels your deep concern about student poverty?
* It is the singular major factor which militates against student
happiness. I suppose, too, that I remember the bliss of my own student
days, not long ago really, just 15 years or so: all my fees paid -- as a
matter of right -- by the local authority and a grant level that allowed
a pretty decent standard of living. It's so hard nowadays for students
to get by without jobs during term, let alone in the vacations.
* How does your experience of student life relate to that of today?
* I'm not sure, to be honest. I went to rather an odd university, with
a collegiate system, ancient buildings and a tradition for allowing
students to do no work, while encouraging them to do plays, sports,
comedy and so on instead. My student life was in some respects rather
different, therefore, from that of the average Dundonian. But the
similarities count: there were still the problems, for all that, of
academic pressure, financial worries and so on . . . in fact, Cambridge
notably had (and, I believe, still has) a far grimmer record of student
suicides than Dundee.
* What is your attitude towards student loans?
* Well, at first I was repelled by them; it seemed to me to be a
mean-spirited short-sighted, ill-conceived idea, at odds with what I
assumed was a consensus on the part of the nation that their young
should be educated at the willing expense of us all. The repayment comes
when students go into work and start paying tax and giving back to the
society which succored them. But, to be realistic, they exist, and to
ignore them would be silly. If that's the only way we can currently
afford students, then it's better than means-testing parents or denying
places to students from poorer families. So, grudgingly, it has to be
faced that student loans are better than nothing.
* What should be done to combat student poverty?
* Well, it's all part of the nation's commitment to tertiary
education, really. The problem is partly to do with the nature of
national and local government restrictions on spending, partly to do
with the expansion of the tertiary sector and the ever-growing need for
young people to qualify to get any sort of job. We have to decide
whether education is an expense or an investment. To the reasonable
person, it's clearly an investment and should be made with full
conviction.
* Will you stand for a third term?
* Lordy: I just can't say. If I'm asked again, I'll certainly think
about it carefully. Really can't peep that far ahead at the moment,
however.
* Finally, what does ''parper'' mean?
* Everyone knows that.

Self-catering, private bathrooms, colour TV, and even computers. The
old wardens would have regarded it all as decadence. ELEANOR HOUGHTON
looks at how luxury has arrived in our halls of residence
'TIME gentlemen, please.' Thirty years ago this is how male visitors
were rudely ejected from single-sex female halls of residence by the
warden at half past nine every night. In the Sixties the principal
criterion for suitable student accommodation seemed to be to keep the
Sexual Revolution well away from well-bred young scholars.
Though mixed halls have been accepted for some time, not all aspects
of halls life were so quick to change. A prurient element could still be
detected, in some cases until the present day, in the general ethos that
halls should not be too comfortable. As in the best public schools, cold
showers, narrow beds and and inedible food were considered
character-building.
But over the last two years, a new generation of ''luxury'' halls have
been spreading across Scotland. Millions of pounds have been spent on
new developments which challenge preconceptions of poor-quality,
cracked-paint institutions, and for the first time the emphasis has
shifted from functional to comfortable.
How? New halls in Dundee, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and
Strathclyde have ''en suite'' bathrooms, and other unprecedented
features like colour TVs and telephone and computer connections in the
bedrooms. Some even have double beds.
All of this is available at a price, of course, but to those who can
afford it, or who feel the extra is worth finding in a tight budget, at
last the choice is available. And it is worth remembering that while any
halls can seem an expensive option (#66 per week for standard full-board
at Edinburgh's Pollock Halls, compared with around #40-#50 for a private
rented flat), fees are for term-time only and are inclusive of bills.
Edinburgh University publicity about the new halls explains that they
are not a ''student feather-bedding exercise''. That it is considered
necessary to justify improving accommodation proves that the ''Hardship
Builds Character'' school of thought still exists. Indeed, providing
better conditions may not be for the benefit of students at all, and has
more to do with the demands of paying summer and conference visitors,
who increasingly expect a higher standard of facilities.
But, as John Lindsay of Edinburgh University explains, the new luxury
benefits students not only because they can use the rooms during
term-time, but also because conference revenue is used to subsidise hall
fees.
Other universities insist the new standards are due to student demand.
Certainly, financial self-sufficiency means filling rooms during
holidays is important, but St Andrews University's programme came about
after a survey of what students wanted, according to Miss Clifford,
spokeswoman for the university. The same is true at Dundee. Residencies
officer David Brand finds that en suite facilities in particular are
requested by students. ''Students today are more health- and
hygiene-conscious, and they don't like sharing bathrooms,'' he says.
Gone are the joys of a dual shower-footbath, paddling in mysterious
ankle-deep waters, as shower drains block up with the hairs of others.
Another drive for change has come from the information technology
revolution. Though Aberdeen University has concentrated on providing
well-equipped computer suites in some Halls, Dundee makes a feature of
linking up individual rooms to the Internet. New halls in St Andrews and
Edinburgh also provide telephone and computer points. Access to
technology is an important aspect of modern academic life, and such
facilities can be considered a necessity.
This is all very well for those able to afford higher fees, lucky
enough to attend a university with this type of development, and to find
a place in these popular new halls. And at about #100 extra a term in
most cases, the new halls are for students who hold their comforts dear
indeed. At the new St Andrews facility, those who have taken the new
soft option have proved to be the slightly financially better off, but
also more mature students. Returning to full-time education after a
break is a daunting enough prospect without having to face
boarding-school austerity, it seems.
Fortunately for others, it seems new ''luxury halls'' are just a small
part of plans to upgrade university-owned accommodation across the
country. Installing computer and telephone points is a relatively simple
operation, but there are also plans to refurbish some older halls
incorporating en suite bathrooms.
Though Edinburgh University admits that attracting other guests is the
main motive for change, John Lindsay makes the point that students
shouldn't have to rent deteriorating accommodation. Rents in university
areas are generally much higher than other areas, so students have a
right to expect acceptable standards.
One thing is certain -- the old wardens would find these new halls of
residence almost unrecognisable compared to the halls of 30 years ago.
Self-catering, private bathrooms, colour TVs, computers would probably
be regarded as the trappings of decadence. And we can only imagine what
they would make of double beds.

They're a mixed bag but don'tcha just love 'em? Fraser Nelson looks at
Scotland's uni-chiefs
THERE is nothing that animates the student body more than choosing a
celebrity representative. With a free hand to approach anyone in the
country, the hunt is on every three years, for a candidate with
respectability, intellectual renown and the fighting spirit needed to
campaign for student rights. It therefore came as some surprise to
Andrew Ridgely to be voted in as honorary president of the University of
Stirling. He won by 503 votes to 500 against (he was unopposed) but is
under no real obligation to be active -- it is an honorary post,
designed to make Stirling students laugh when they pass his portrait in
the union.
The duties of a rector are much more serious. By preserving medieval
university tradition, five Scottish universities can elect anyone they
like to occupy the third highest position in their university. Sadly,
all this is entirely beside the point at election time. The vast
majority of students know little and care less about the finer points of
the university mechanics. For most, university court is where you are
taken after perpetrating some complex practical joke on the halls'
warden. The selection of Rector is, therefore, based on sheer
popularity.

They're a mixed bag but don'tcha just love 'em? FRASER NELSON looks at
Scotland's honorary uni-chiefs
* JOHNNY BALL: In 1993, a children's television presenter defeated an
internationally-acclaimed lawyer to the third highest post in Glasgow
University. Helena Kennedy QC had liberated the Birmingham Six and was
at the cutting edge of international feminist legal theory. Johnny Ball
presented Think of a Number. For the students, there was no competition.
''I think I had a bit of an unfair advantage over Helena,'' Johnny
admits. ''The kids remember my programmes, and I seem to have won a bit
of their affection.''
This is a gross understatement. Johnny Ball is little short of a cult
hero in Glasgow. He receives standing ovations whenever he enters the
debating halls. Students climb over each other to buy him drinks in
exchange for his signature. As far as they're concerned, his duty is
simple: to exist. All they want is Johnny Ball on a plate.
Almost by coincidence, Johnny Ball works quite hard. ''I can take any
student issue right to the Principal's desk. I chair university court
meetings and can refuse to move the meeting on if it is necessary.''
He has used his powers to curb a rise in halls fees, and is not scared
to check the Principal, for whom he shows sympathy. ''He looks so sad
when I tell him that the system's not working,'' says Ball. ''His eyes
go all gloomy. He often agrees, but says the system is the system, and
there's not a lot we can do.
''But I have more freedom, which I use to benefit the students as best
I can.''
The mad gamble of electing the star of Play-Away over has paid off.
* IAIN HAMILTON QC: Despite Helena Kennedy's defeat, QCs currently
account for 40% of Scottish rectors. To Iain Hamilton QC, Rector of
Aberdeen University, the strength of his position is that it subverts.
''Without a rector, there would be two people at the top,'' he says.
''Two can cohort and scheme. With three, there are quarrels. This is
medieval wisdom -- put three kids together and watch the result. The
Principal should be watching his back all the time, because I shall
certainly challenge him.''
Iain Hamilton QC has one distinct advantage over the competition.
While at university, he committed the greatest student theft in history.
In 1953, he was prime mover in the stealing of the Stone of Destiny from
Westminster -- which was briefly returned to Scotland.
''Well, you can't separate a man from his history,'' Hamilton admits.
''I am very proud of what I did and still believe that the only reason a
man should visit Westminster is to pillage it. But I've had a few more
accomplishments in my time than just stealing a stone.''
Iain Hamilton is a rebel of the first water -- he even rides a
motor-bike -- and that fact that is not lost on the students of
Aberdeen.
* DONALD FINDLAY QC: Lawyers, with their comprehensive knowledge of
the system, can be relied upon to subvert it where necessary. This
inherent advantage is recognised by St Andrews students who recently
elected Donald Findlay QC as their rector. Findlay, however, sees it as
a coincidence.
''We are all completely different people,'' he says. ''Iain Hamilton
is an eccentric nationalist, Helena Kennedy is a Bolshevik feminist, and
I am a nice guy who offends no one.''
He wouldn't mind offending the university authorities, though. ''The
university is a multi-million pound company. As rector, I am the chair
of the university court, which is a multi-million-pound company. I
control the purse-strings and not one penny can be spent without my
say-so. This puts the students in a very powerful position.''
This is assuming that the rector sticks to expressing student
concerns. In electing a rector, students can make mistakes. One such was
Pat Kane, singer of late-80s pop group Hue and Cry, Rector of Glasgow
University 1990-3. He had a political agenda of his own.
''My goal was to drag education from its Thatcherite foxhole of
decay,'' he recalls. ''The students, by and large, didn't want to know.
Their attitude was 'go to uni, get drunk, get a job'. Pathetic. They
kept asking me to play gigs for the toga night at the kayak club or
whatever. I just thought, 'Away and lose yoursel'. I left with the
conclusion that education is wasted on 17- to 21-year-olds''.
So Kane didn't like the students and the students didn't like Kane.
This is not Donald Findlay's idea of representation. ''The Rector is
there for students and students alone. The purpose of university is to
enjoy yourself and broaden your horizons and have a go at everything --
politics if you feel so inclined. People who use the post as a vehicle
for their own political views are a waste of space.''
* DR MALCOLM MACLEOD: Edinburgh University students have broken the
long line of whacky tradition. Last year, they turned down Tony
Slattery, the STV weatherman and perpetual try-hard Richard Demarco in
favour of a mild-mannered Edinburgh dentist.
Dr Malcom Macleod is home-grown: an ex-student and ex-president of
Edinburgh's SRC. He feels in the position to make up for his lack of
glamour by hard work.
''I am placed to give the position the time it deserves. I can hold
weekly drop-in meetings, discuss and act upon student issues.'' He has
set himself the task of visiting local secondary schools to persuade
school-leavers that university it is not the preserve of the rich.
''The position of Rector is only as good as the candidate. Celebrities
have many, many other duties and seldom know the territory. I am an
Edinburgh man and have promised to hold weekly surgeries to see students
whenever they need me.''
He didn't fancy his chances against the celebrities, though. ''If it
were a beauty contest, I would have come last. But it seems the students
are after something more than glamour.''

It's been a long slog for a talented young artist. TERRY ANDERSON can
hardly believe it. But it's coming true . . .
HEY, kids! Do you remember talking to a careers officer back in your
school days? Or going to a university open day? Your memories of these
experiences probably don't include feelings of frustration, anger or (in
one case) floods of tears, as mine do.
Ever since I was a child, my mind has centred around a single
ambition. Although the specifics have changed slightly over the years
(from cartoonist to animator to comic-book artist) my dream has always
been the same -- to show the world my work, and try to make a living in
the process. Unfortunately, this idea did not seem to mesh with the
world I lived in.
For years, I was educated by people who couldn't tell the difference
between a cartoonist and a commercial artist, who told me comic-book art
wasn't ''real'', and seemed uncomfortable with the notion that someone
might be able to turn a hobby into a job. I realised that while my
friends were finding courses and qualifications tailor-made for their
career choices, I was sitting in the middle of a culture unwilling and
unable to accommodate me.
But this isn't meant to be some bitter tirade against society. This is
a happy story (all the more so because it is true) intended for anyone
who feels that his or her life is following Plan B, anyone who abandoned
wilder, more passionate, more original ambitions, not because they
weren't possible, but because no-one else seemed to understand. Because
the end was well thought-out but the means were not. Perhaps that spark
of inspiration was snuffed out by circumstance. There is always hope.
You have to keep your eyes open, though.
Thankfully, my eyes were more or less open when, in 1993, I spotted a
half-page ad for an art school open day in a back issue of The Fantastic
Four (nowhere near as sad as it sounds, and nothing to do with Enid
Blyton). American comic. American school. Maybe worth a letter anyway.
As it turned out, The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art does
accept foreign students, and based purely on the merit of their
performance in an interview and their folio.
At the time, I was just about to begin my fifth year of secondary
school. It would be a long time before I knew my Higher results, and
whether or not a sixth year was on the cards. I didn't have a college
fund like most of my American competitors did (competitors because the
School only accepts 110 out of 500-600 applicants every year) and I was
pretty sure John Major wasn't going to come up with the money. It cost
#30,000 to complete the three-year diploma course. Despite all this, it
was the best option I'd been offered by anyone.
Two years on, and I'm on the other side of the world as you read this,
beginning my first year at The Joe Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey.
How I got here has been a mixture of hard work and a little luck. During
my eventual sixth year of school, I began sending countless letters, CVs
and examples of my work to likely sympathisers, with the backing of the
Renfrewshire Education Business Partnership which is based in my home
town of Paisley.
My suspicions about government were confirmed, and so I focused my
attention on the private sector. Although most people already in the
business were happier to give advice rather than make a more tangible
commitment, I did make a few allies along the way. Meanwhile, I achieved
an A in SYS Art with a cartoon-based folio, and became involved in Young
Enterprise activities within school.
My success there brought me to the attention of many potential
supporters, and meant that after leaving school I could work freelance.
I produced graphics for ScottishPower and Scottish Enterprise and
monthly cartoons for the hallowed newspaper you now hold. Combining my
income from these contracts with personal funds meant I could make an
application to the School with confidence and my placement was confirmed
in February.
Since then I have received support from Renfrewshire Educational Trust
and, thanks to another bit of eagle-eyed reading, was awarded a
substantial sum by the STUC's James Milne Memorial Trust just last
month.
Seeing all this written down, the whole thing seems phenomenally easy;
IT WASN'T. For every wonderful friend who said ''yes, I'll help'' there
were a dozen dead ends and unfulfilled promises. The only way anyone can
find out about these little reservoirs of money is to tell absolutely
everyone you meet what it is you want to do, to read the papers
regularly, to explore every possibility and then re-explore them, to
harass, nag and annoy the fat cats until they cough up.
Yes, you will become a crushing bore and people will probably hate
you, but it'll work.
Although my first year is secure, I am still campaigning for funding
for the second and third (donations c/o The Editor). I clearly have a
long way to go, and it is possible I won't make it to the end. However,
the fact remains that I am now among like-minded people, receiving the
education I want, in the hope of leading my ideal life. The dream is
nearing reality, and if it ever falls apart, I will at least have the
knowledge that I tried. We all owe ourselves that favour.

If you want to be an Interesting Person, don't pussyfoot around -- lie
flagrantly and outrageously, says Gerard Seenan
WHOEVER said honesty is the best policy was a liar. If you want to win
friends and influence people then the best, no only, policy is to lie.
Don't fib, tell porkies, tall tales or falsehoods. Forget all those
boring euphemisms; what you need to do is pervert the truth beyond any
semblance of reality -- you need to tell great, big stonking lies.
Now liars fall in to two categories: those who can get away with it
and those who can't, and the only factor separating these groups is
imagination. If you're going to lie then lie outrageously. Don't be
namby-pamby and pussyfoot about. The more exorbitant and flagrantly
untrue the lie, the more believable it is.
The fact that you spent the summer packing shelves in Asda to help pay
for your first term's expenses rates a consummate zero on the
Interesting Scale and will endear you to no-one save your ever-loving
mother. Lie Number One: you spent the summer travelling.
Every Fresher known to man wants to travel. Not go on holiday -- oh
no, the pretentious little gits want to spend the summer in a state of
extreme discomfort, preferably in baking heat, sleeping in a hammock
with chronic diarrhoea and not a penny to their name in some mangy part
of the Indian sub-continent.
Let the stories abound, of how you met a maharishi in Jaipur, before
travelling on to Delhi to live in abject poverty on a roadside -- you
missed out the Taj Mahal because, you know, there are just too many
tourists there. Don't bother with any half-baked nonsense about spending
the summer in France -- it's far too easy to get caught.
Next in the line-up of Freshers' Week lies is drugs. It doesn't matter
if your father plays a key role in the Department of Customs and Excise
and the closest you've ever come to a joint is your elbow, take the
sensible option and lie.
On the way back from your travels in India you journeyed through Nepal
-- where the people are so, like, at peace with themselves (the fact
that they have nothing, live in mud huts and eat the same food seven
days a week is entirely irrelevant. Ludicrous statements like this carry
weight in the student world).
While in this little kingdom you were given a few ounces of Nepalese
black by a local goat herd in exchange for your Nike trainers. Now you
just happened to smuggle the said hashish back into the country and
would your compatriots like some?
Just the job here will be an Oxo cube mixed with some black shoe
polish, and while we're on the subject, if you're particularly skint,
why not flog them some parsley and freeze-dried herbs as ''best
quality'' grass later in the term? There's no fool like a first-year
student.
In those particularly dull afternoons friends can always be sought
from the English Literature Department. Easily recognisable, you'll find
them poncing about the quads with University scarves on looking like
refugees from Brideshead Revisited. Never make the mistake of telling
them you've read anything popular or, God forbid, intelligible.
A prime text to use here is Thomas Pynchon's Gravity Rainbow, a boring
and impenetrable tome by some hermetical American -- you don't have to
read the thing, just mutter the phrase ''deconstructionism'' rather a
lot and you'll go down a treat. A few references to Thomas Mann, James
Joyce and Milan Kundera (apart from The Unbearable Lightness of Being,
far too popular) and you're away.
As far as music is concerned, you're into gabba (don't worry they
won't know what it is either) and to top off any conversation there's
the old stalwart, film. Under no circumstances let on that you've ever
been to the Odeon. Lord no, of an evening you frequent the Edinburgh
Film House, GFT and the ilk. Favourite films include that Hong Kong
classic City of Fire -- and, you know, Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs just
completely rips it off -- and anything by any Icelander, Finn, Swede or
any national of any country where they have practically no indigenous
film-making.
So there you go. Forget honesty, prepare yourself for a rather sultry
afterlife, tell scandalous and heinous lies without even the merest
twinge of conscience, and you're half way to being President of the
Union.

BERNARD Gallacher had a four-word answer today when he was asked if he
would consider staying on as European Ryder Cup captain after their
magnificent, heart-stopping victory over the Americans at Oak Hill.
''Never, never, never, never,'' said the 46-year-old Scot. ''I'll be
glad to move out of the public light.''
Gallacher was persuaded by the players to lead them again this year
after handing in his letter of resignation even before the 15-13 defeat
at The Belfry in 1993.
The morning after the 14[1/2]-13[1/2] triumph of the night before,
Gallacher did not allow his jubilation to change his belief that Seve
Ballesteros was the obvious choice to succeed him for the first-ever
match to be held in Spain at Valderrama in two years' time.
''It's an open secret that I think it should be Seve. It's probably up
to him -- the only question is whether we can have a playing captain.
''I don't think it's going to be a difficult decision for the Ryder
Cup Committee. It just depends if the person that's asked will want to
do the job.''
Ballesteros himself said: ''It would be a tremendous honour to captain
the team -- some time. I will have to make a decision if I am asked, but
I don't think you can play and be captain.''
The Ryder Cup Committee, of which Ballesteros was a member until he
resigned last year after disagreeing with the choice of Valderrama,
meets on November 16.
They do not have to decide then, but one option they could consider is
to appoint Ballesteros as captain, but also to have a manager-type
figure on stand-by should the 38-year-old qualify for the side again.
On the evidence of Oak Hill there is not much chance. Ballesteros,
left out of the two foursomes sessions, joked: ''I played three matches
and hit only three fairways. I cleared all the rough and all the
branches from the golf course -- I'm sure all the members are not going
to lose any balls any more.''
But he has come back from slumps before and Bernhard Langer said
before stepping on to Concorde yesterday: ''I think he will get his game
back in the winter and when he hits it straight he will be one of the
best in the world again.''
Langer, Faldo, and Colin Montgomerie are obvious future captains as
well -- and Sam Torrance would have been a strong alternative candidate
for Valderrama but for the fact that at 42 he is playing the golf of his
life. Leader of the order of merit, Oak Hill was easily the best of his
eight Ryder Cups with three wins.
The great thing about this weekend's match was that every one of the
12-strong side contributed at least one point.
Corey Pavin was the top points-scorer with four wins out of five and
Phil Mickelson won all his three games, but current Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw and twice US Open champion Curtis Strange left empty-handed.
There was no doubt which of the two departed feeling the worse.
Strange led Faldo by one with two to play and America would have
retained the trophy even if he had finished all square, but he bogeyed
the last three -- and that after he was just short in two whereas Faldo
was 93 yards from the flag.
The best pitch-and-putt of Faldo's glittering career -- his wedge shot
finished a mere three feet from the flag -- was one of five last-hole
dramas on the gripping final afternoon. Of the five, Howard Clark, David
Gilford, Faldo, and Philip Walton all won and Ian Woosnam got a half.
Those who were waiting to change Oak Hill to Choke Hill got their
chance, but it was home players who left themselves open to the jibe.
Strange, chosen by captain Lanny Wadkins for his strength of character
even though he had not won a tour event since his US Open win on the
course in 1989, missed a six-foot putt, Brad Faxon a five-footer, and
then Jay Haas, having kept the cup alive by taking the sixteenth and
seventeenth off Walton, drove into the trees on the last and allowed the
Irishman to be the hero with a bogey 5.
Never has a bogey felt better than it did for the 33-year-old cup
rookie from Malahide, who feared his missed four-foot putt on the
seventeenth would haunt him.
''When I was playing the eighteenth I had someone else's legs, I tell
ya. It was suicide stuff out there and it's not a nice situation to be
in, but there's a lot of satisfaction in coming through it and it will
make me a stronger person.''
The 1993 victory has to be considered a finer achievement that the
1985 and 1987 ones because Europe's superstars were at the peak of their
powers then. This year they were not and one of them, Jose Maria
Olazabal, was not there at all because of injury.
After all the criticism he took from his predecessor Tony Jacklin and
others, Gallacher had the last laugh. He came back, at his players'
urging, to lead them to glory and, with a few scares along the way, he
did.
* BALLESTEROS suggested to Gallacher that the European team should
wear blue instead of green for Sunday's 12 singles matches. Ballesteros
said it was his lucky colour -- and Gallacher bought it.
''It was going to be green and I went to Bernard and said it should be
blue,'' Ballesteros said. ''He gave me a look and then said, 'Alright,
we'll change.' ''
* EUROPE have been installed 10-11 favourites by bookmakers William
Hill to win the 1997 match at Valderrama. The United States are quoted
at evens with the draw a 10-1 chance.

* THE tan peeled off in the shower, everyone's seen the photos --
twice -- and the cheap local brew you imported tastes oddly like lighter
fluid. Coming back from your holdays is grim enough, but returning after
a year abroad can be the maiden relative of all anti-climaxes.
The consensus (see left) is that study abroad offers
once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, but what's life like once it's all
over?
Fifth-year Aberdeen University French and Spanish student Lesley
Nicolson spent ten months in Mexico, followed by four in Reunion Island,
near Madagascar. She describes her experience as ''incredible'' but
suffered a year-out hangover in the form of course work piling
headachingly high on her return.
She says: ''The problem was that when I went away, I didn't study as
hard as I should have done. I went to a few classes, but they were all
quite relaxed.
''It was a bit of a shock to the system coming back and realising I
had to work very hard to catch up.''
Although her language skills were enhanced, essay-writing, after more
than a year's break, was hard to pick up again. ''It was difficult. My
course is continuous assessment and my first essay marks were low. In
that sense I was penalised for my time abroad.''
Heriot-Watt Chemistry and French student Kathryn Naughton enjoyed her
year in Lille so much she stayed on for the summer. She describes coming
back as ''weird'' and says: ''I was really phased for a while. I missed
France a lot at first, having got used to a different way of life.
''You also gain a lot of freedom and independence as an exchange
student whereas you come home to be just another student in the
department.''
While acknowledging such problems exchange programme co-ordinators
generally agree re-adjustment to be a character-building experience.
''Making the transitions between the cultures is all part of the
learning process a year abroad entails,'' says Aberdeen University
international office director Dr Jeffrey Stone.
Some schemes have built-in facilities to help ease the transition: at
Heriot-Watt university, veterans meet with future exchange students to
help prepare them for their year abroad and what comes after.
Glasgow university ERASMUS accountancy students are visited by a
member of their department midway through the exchange, to plan their
study for when they return.
Yet potentially, finishing the year out remains problematic, even for
those whose experiences were negative. Glasgow University French student
Oona Macfarlane, ''hated'' her exchange as a language assistant in
northern France, finding her accommodation to be unsuitable and her host
school unfriendly. Although coming home was ''a relief'', she adds:
''I'm utterly panic-stricken about going back to study. I'm terrified
that everyone's French will be better than mine because they've had
better years abroad.''
However, of the difficulties encountered by returning year-abroad
students, the most common appears to be a desire to go straight back.
Lesley Nicolson has already planned a further year in Mexico once her
degree is over. Two of her friends are returning to marry Mexicans they
met while on the exchange. Despite her experience Oona Macfarlane is
considering becoming a French teacher and looks forward to going back to
the country.
Dr Stone says European exchange programmes now offer a simple remedy
for those whose reverse-homesickness proves overpowering: ''They can
always negotiate to complete their study abroad. The European Credit
Transfer system entails slotting what they've learned at home into other
EU degree systems.
''It is not only becoming easier, but a more recognised way of doing
things.''

<HEADLINE>Coulthard ready to carry on winning</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STILL beaming after his first Formula 1 triumph, David Coulthard
yesterday said he intended to carry on winning, but, even though still
swamped by euphoria, he was not careless enough to suggest that he could
mount a late challenge to claim the world championship.
The Scot began to realise his undoubted title potential with a
comprehensive victory in Sunday's Portuguese Grand Prix after 20
unsuccessful attempts and, although his win lifted him to third place in
the championship, he is 33 points behind defending champion Michael
Schumacher.
Even Coulthard's Williams team-mate Damon Hill has all but written off
his title hopes after having slipped further behind Schumacher -- the
gap is now 17 points with just four races left -- after having finished
third and, although a display of bravado would have gone down well with
headlines writers, Coulthard could not be tempted.
''It's wins that matter to me this year,'' said the driver whose place
with McLaren is expected to be confirmed at this weekend's European
Grand Prix. ''The championship is for another year.''
''The title, in fact, doesn't bother me either way. This is my first
full season in Formula 1 so just getting a win or two is more important
and I've now reached a level which has allowed me to qualify in pole
position and race from the front, which I have done in the last two
grands prix.
''Thankfully, I had the reliability to win this one. I have won a
grand prix fairly and squarely in front of Michael and Damon, who are
the championship contenders, and I'll enjoy it, but it's now a case of
getting back down to work and looking ahead to the Nurburgring on
Sunday.''
Coulthard's comfortable triumph in Estoril ensured he achieved the
first of his objectives this season and with the backing of Williams --
both car and team -- should also manage the second. ''I said at the
start of the year I wanted to win a grand prix and finish in the top
three in the championship,'' he added. ''I've done the first now and
will be racing as hard as I can for the rest of the season.''
Team owner Frank Williams said of his outgoing driver's victory:
''David demonstrated here that he has a mature head on his shoulders and
that he is going to be a top driver for many years to come.''
There must be a hint of regret that the team have allowed
Twynholm-born Coulthard to leave, although Ron Dennis, who looks set to
welcome him at McLaren next season, hinted at the weekend that Williams
may not have had a choice in the matter.
It is also clear Williams will not sacrifice the team hopes of a
fourth successive constructors' crown -- they are now just 12 points
behind Benetton -- by taking the risk of ordering Coulthard to let Hill
win. ''The great thing is Frank (Williams) and Patrick (Head) told me
that if I am not holding Damon up I am free to race which, given the
position of the championship, could not be fairer.
''I believe it will be the same situation for the rest of the year.
It's the fairest way. If I am holding Damon up then I should not race
with him because he has an outside chance of the championship, but for
the team it's all about getting constructors' points and that's probably
more important to them than winning the drivers' championship.''
Meanwhile, Japanese driver Ukyo Katayama, who crashed spectacularly at
the start of Portuguese Grand Prix, was discharged from hospital
yesterday and could take part in next weekend's race.
His Tyrrell flew through the air after a collision with the Minardi of
Italian Luca Badoer and then barrel-rolled into the barriers before
coming to rest upside down in the middle of the track.
Katayama lost consciousness briefly after the crash but suffered no
serious injury.
No decision will be made on whether he races in this Sunday's race
until after a medical examination tomorrow by F1 doctor Sid Watkins.

It was 'the best year of my life' said one student who really went for
it. But the SOCRATES scheme has snags too, says ELEANOR HOUGHTON
EUROPE. Home of crazed Commissioners who dictate regulations on bent
bananas, crooked cucumbers and give free cash to students to go to
exciting European locations. Only one of the above -- the exciting one
-- is anything more than a Euro-myth and it's called SOCRATES. Formerly
known as ERASMUS, it is a European exchange programme for university
students.
In fact, it is probably the best-known European Commission programme.
Since 1987 it has offered tremendous opportunities for students to live
and study in foreign countries. Every UK university participates and
there is an exchange available for almost every subject and to almost
every country in the EU.
Under the scheme, students can receive a grant to cover travel and the
extra living costs of living abroad to study in another European
university for between three months and a year. SOCRATES will also pay
for intensive language training. Paris, Florence, Copenhagen . . .
Europe is your oyster.
Too good to be true? James went from Glasgow to study English
literature in Turin last year, and returned as an enthusiast for the
scheme. ''It's free money to go abroad,'' he says. ''But most people
have never heard of it in Scotland. I've heard it's very competitive to
get a place in most European countries, but I told my tutor I wanted to
go, and within three months I was in Italy.''
Claire, a Law student who went to Holland from Dundee, has a similarly
glowing report: ''The best year of my life!'' She has lived at home
while at university so she felt ''the independence of living abroad was
particularly valuable to me; now no employer can say I lacked
initiative''.
But James and Claire had very different experiences when it came to
paternalistic care in their host universities. While Holland provides
good student accommodation and facilities, Italian universities, as
James found, couldn't care less: ''It took us quite a while to find a
flat, but we were lucky in that Italian people, as opposed to
universities, are very helpful towards strangers.
''Eventually we found a tiny flat near a beautiful park. It was the
chief hunting ground for transvestites, but we thought they added colour
to the area.''
John Reilly, UK Director of SOCRATES, feels being abandoned like this
in a strange land is not neccessarily a negative experience. ''It's no
bad thing to have to fend for yourself,'' he says. ''British students do
complain more about domestic arrangements than other nationalities. I
think it's because they tend to be younger and come from a far more
sheltered university system, so they take welfare facilities for
granted.''
Knowing she had a place in a hall of residence before she left was
reassuring to Claire, but in practice she found it ''a bit of a SOCRATES
ghetto''. She met lots of people from different countries but very few
Dutch. Because there were so many nationalities, English was the lingua
franca so I didn't have a chance to speak a foreign language. After a
while, I moved out and found my own place.''
And James, who had to cope without help from the university, seems to
agree: ''Surely it misses the point if everything is arranged for you. I
feel more confident now, having organised things myself, and I'm
planning to live and work abroad when I graduate.''
Like James, Claire now sees international borders as less of a barrier
and wants to specialise in European Law and work in Brussels or
Luxembourg. ''I just miss the beer,'' she says.
If Scots are to compete in the European job market we need to be
prepared to learn foreign languages and travel to find work. James feels
this helps define the purpose of SOCRATES. ''There would be less
unemployment in the EU as a whole if more people were prepared to move
to different countries,'' he says.
But can it really be claimed that a scheme like this helps the
economy? More than 14,000 students from the UK are expected to take
advantage of the scheme this year, yet this represents only about 5% of
the student population. The British government feels that available
funds should be targeted at all students, arguing that ''open distance
learning'' and more university staff exchanges would let UK students
taste Continental Europe from their own campuses.
This does not convince John Reilly. For him, one of the greatest
benefits of the existing scheme is what he calls the ''multiplier
effect'' -- for every student SOCRATES helps, his or her enthusiasm for
the new Europe is passed on to family and friends. It is certainly hard
to see how the confidence and cultural insight gained by Claire and
James could have been achieved using a slide projector in Dundee. ''It
wouldn't work,'' says James. ''You just can't get good espresso in
Glasgow.''
As far as individual students are concerned, the experience they
gained from actually living abroad is irreplaceable. However, although
SOCRATES is a lot of fun and enhances job prospects, it is less certain
that it will improve your academic status. Many SOCRATES students can
gain an extra qualification in their host country, but this is not
universal and, in the past, individual experiences have varied widely.
Claire and John feel their overall degrees might have been affected,
but not beyond repair. For Claire, her Dutch coursework was out of line
with what she'd been studying in Dundee. James found there were no
classes at all in Turin on the subjects he was studying. ''Great,'' he
says. ''It was a real home from home.''
Sadly, the recent introduction of the European Credit Transfer System
should ensure there will be work to do for all SOCRATES students. In
future, SOCRATES will be as valuable academically as it is socially.
If there is a complaint from SOCRATES students it is usually that the
''travel and displacement'' grant is not big enough. Unfortunately, this
may get worse in the future. In the coming academic session student
numbers will rise by 8-9% over last year's figures with a funding rise
of only 0.3%.
When ERASMUS changed its name to SOCRATES at the beginning of the
year, the changes were mostly administrative.
The biggest change is in funding. Under ERASMUS, all students who took
part received a grant, which was not means-tested. Now, there are fewer
grants and those are allocated by the university -- to its own criteria.
This means more people can apply, but it is now possible to take part in
SOCRATES, unlike ERASMUS, without any funding from anyone. But for those
whose course includes time abroad, such as languages or business, the
government allocates separate grants on a means-tested basis.
Even with funding, James and Claire found money was short. ''I'll
never get a Eurocheque card again, and the bank cut my credit card into
tiny pieces,'' says Claire. ''But I don't care. I could have stayed at
home and saved money; but if I could do it again I'd never miss out, no
matter what it cost.''

KILMARNOCK chairman Bob Fleeting, stung by recent criticism of his
leadership, reacted in typically forthright style yesterday by
announcing that he is willing to relinquish his post and move aside.
Fleeting, who is only nine weeks short of a six-year reign, accepts
that directors, like footballers, can overstay their welcomes and if
others believe he has passed his sell-by date he would not risk the
club's future by attempting to cling to power.
It is my belief that the controlling interest in Kilmarnock, who have
started the season miserably, could be bought for #2.5m.
Fleeting and his directors, American Laurel Chadwick, who is the
chairman's mother-in-law, former owner of AT Mays Jim Moffat, John
Paton, the former Rangers chairman, and Ronnie Hamilton, appear to be in
agreement that if someone else is willing to take the club forward all
they have to do is lift the phone and make an offer.
If any prospective buyer wants to retain the services of some
directors but not all, then that, too, would be acceptable so long as
the club was being transferred to a caring owner.
Moffat, who along with Chadwick is a major shareholder, would be
willing to dilute his shareholding but would perfer to remain on any new
board.
''My shares are not for sale but I wouldn't mind them being diluted. I
came aboard Kilmarnock six years ago to take them forward and we can
only do that with more cash,'' he said.
Although an individual who would rather speak out than suffer in
silence, Fleeting's commitment to the Kilmarnock cause has never been in
doubt and the changes forced through after he had won a protracted
takeover battle -- with the help of the supporters, it should be
remembered -- have carried the club into the real world.
Fans of most clubs will always complain that more money should be
spent on strengthening the playing squads, but, as more than Kilmarnock
are discovering in these Taylor Report dominated times, rebuilding
stadiums and teams simultaneously is impossible.
''I can hear the criticism and I have spoken to Jim Moffat and Mrs
Chadwick and perhaps it is time to see if there is anyone else in
Scotland willing to operate a football club,'' Fleeting said. ''Maybe
we've taken this club as far as we can, but I have to say it was always
only our intention to get Kilmarnock moving in the right direction and I
believe we have done that.''
Undoubtedly, Fleeting and his people, who he claims have put
''hundreds of thousands of pounds'' into the club during their term, are
hurt by criticisms that they could be doing more to give Alex Totten
better players when the new Rugby Park and the team's premier-division
status are not false testament to the work achieved.
Granted the team's dismal performances so far in the premier division
in which they are bottom with no points and only one goal scored suggest
an alarming degree of poverty, but a stadium which Fleeting says was
recently priced at #17m by an independent valuer proves no-one has been
wasting time in the boardroom. Rugby Park, which cost #5.5m to rebuild
and has an all-seated capacity of 18,200, is one of only a handful of
fully completed grounds in the country.

* SCOTTISH MPs are to meet football chiefs tomorrow to discuss the
implications of the Jean Marc Bosman decision.
The European Court last week ruled the European transfer system
illegal in a decision which could change the face of the game.
Members of the all-party Parliamentary Scottish Sports Group will meet
officials from the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish
Football League at Hampden Park.
Labour MP Dennis Canavan, head of the group, said: ''We want to have
some discussions on the implications of the Bosman ruling for clubs in
Scotland and on the subject of the employment of foreign players.
''The European ruling could have implications which may involve the
Government having to amend legislation.''

* A FEW years ago the average student newspaper would have been more
likely to contain greasy chips than interviews with the likes of Blur,
Martin Amis and Chris Evans. But in the new age of Internet
cyber-democracy and cheap desk-top publishing packages, all is changed.
The chips are down and student media is going places fast.
There are currently more than 850 student titles coming hot off the
presses in the UK. Some, like Student, Edinburgh University's paper --
founded in 1887 by Robert Louis Stevenson -- are well established.
However, recent years have seen a real explosion in the volume of
student media in Britain. Seemingly, you can't teach a parrot to talk
these days without some bright spark setting up a magazine in the cage.
But why are people attracted to student media? Gayle MacIntyre, editor
of Strathclyde University's Telegraph, has the answer. ''It's just such
a great buzz,'' she enthuses. ''Nothing compares with holding that new
edition and thinking you made it. I just love it.''
Still, no matter how many titles there are, what matters is whether
they are any good. Not too long ago, student media blotted its copybook
with a reputation for inaccuracy and bad writing. But in the last few
years all that has changed. The student media has graduated to the big
league, scoring interviews and scooping stories that the estblished
press would be proud of. John Mulholland, media editor at The Guardian
-- of Glasgow University -- agrees.
''There are now many good student media,'' he says. ''I think that's
got a lot to do with DIY publishing and media literacy. Perhaps the best
student media isn't much better than 10 years ago, but there's an awful
lot more of it.''
It isn't just media-types in the know who value student journalism.
The Principal of Strathclyde University, Professor John Arbuthnott, also
acknowledges its importance, noting that ''any student publication is
immensely important''. He elaborates: ''It is the way in which the
student body communicates and informs. I see it as a very important part
of our community life together.''
The president of the National Union of Students, Jim Murphy, is also
quick with applause, despite recognising potential faults. ''At its
best, student media is a constant invitation to get involved in all
aspects of the student movement,'' he comments. ''At its worst it is
cliquey, insular and self-important; owned and run for a minority.''
So what makes a good student paper? Lisa Pritchard, full-time editor
of Gair Rhydd, the University of Cardiff's paper, believes simply that
it should be ''something that students actually want to read''. John
Mulholland goes further . . .
''The ideal student paper should be innovative,'' he says firmly. ''It
doesn't take much to copy something that's already there, be it Wire,
The Face, New Musical Express, The Guardian or whatever.''
That theory is all very well in an ideal universe, but in the real
world student publications face much more fundamental difficulties than
how to rip off that crazy Melody Maker typeface. This is an
all-too-famailiar story of Paul Lang, past editor of Cogno at Robert
Gordon University. Paul was a founding member in 1993, and has found the
romance of print to come complete with less-than-romantic setbacks.
''The main problem was trying to get people involved, basically
getting people in through the door,'' Paul admits with a sigh. ''Another
was selling advertising. Getting people to part with their money for a
student publication isn't easy.''
Such lack of interest seems a common problem for student editors.
Perhaps the student paper has had its day. Perhaps the time has come for
it to be replaced by more hi-tech media. Principal Arbuthnott certainly
seems to think so, commenting that ''in the future, it's not going to be
a question of student newspapers but of student multi-media systems;
there's going to be a bit of a revolution''.
This far-sighted view is supported by Andrej Lipkin, network
controller at Birmingham University's Guild TV, who speculates that ''10
to 15 years from now, every university worth its salt may have its own
television station''.
So does this spell the end for the student press? Is the ink on the
campus finally going to run dry? John Mulholland doesn't think so. He
believes that ''at least for the foreseeable future there will be a
place for student magazines and newspapers''.
It seems then that we are entering a golden age for student media.
Thanks to cheap publishing packages and increased educational access,
the student paper is finally coming of age. Not only that, but
publications are increasingly complemented by student radio and
television.
So, all things considered, in 1995 your standard fish supper may not
taste any better, but you can bet that the wrapper is in a class of its
own.

Iceland
IF his carefully laid plans to control the threat that is posed by
Akranes' highly regarded twins, Arnar and Bjaki Gunnlaugsson, succeeds,
Jimmy Nicholl's Raith Rovers will start Scotland's European week with a
party.
The Fife team hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg, and the mood of
manager and players as they arrived at cold Keflavik airport yesterday
was one of genuine conviction that they will not let their chance slip.
Rovers are desperate to get through to the second round of the UEFA
Cup, where they might achieve the desire they have nurtured since
beating Celtic in the Coca-Cola Cup final in November, to meet one of
the glamorous continental teams.
First, they have to shackle the twins and make sure they protect their
hard-earned lead from Stark's Park. One man who is bound to be
particularly zealous in that respect is defender Julian Broddle who
believed he was suspended from the tie.
In one of the more bizarre episodes in European competition, Broddle
has discovered that UEFA have no record of his booking in the Faroes in
the preliminary round by Welsh referee Alun Howells, only notification
of his yellow card in the first leg of the current round.
''It seems the referee did not include my booking in his report,''
said the delighted Broddle, ''and maybe he reconsidered it and decided
not to record it. I thought it was soft at the time but I now think he
was a brilliant referee. You won't catch me criticising them again.''
Nicholl, who had made his team plans without Broddle, now will accept
UEFA's assurance, albeit reluctantly, that he is clear to play. The Fife
manager, in common with his peers, is always wary of repercussions when
the rules are not administered in a straightforward fashion. However,
the Broddle news balances a little the loss of forwards Ally Graham and
Tony Rougier, both of whom were injured on Saturday.
Graham, in particular, was very much in Nicholl's plans after the
effect his height and strength had when he came on during the second
half of the opening leg.
''I would like to have had Ally for this tie but what is really
important for us here is to get things right defensively,'' said
Nicholl, ''and if we can keep control of the twins there is not a great
deal other than set-piece danger for us to worry about.
''If our markers can do a job on the two danger men it would go a long
way towards taking us through.''
Nicholl is hopeful that his team can snatch a goal, especially as
their recent form has included a steady scoring flow. They have
accumulated nine goals in their last three games, the type of form that
encourages players to believe they can take on anyone.
However, Rovers' respect for the Gunnlaugsson twins is justified.
Striker Arnar has scored 15 goals in seven games this season, including
a hat trick in the 5-1 win over IPV on Saturday. ''There is no doubt
about his quality or that of his brother,'' said Nicholl, ''and they
will expect to be closely watched.''
The Akranes' coach, Logi Olafsson, was saying all the predictable
things managers do in the circumstances.
''We still believe we can get into the next round,'' he said, ''but it
would be foolish to go into all-out attack. We will play our normal game
and hope we can win 2-0.''
Despite that, Nicholl anticipates a whirlwind start from the
Icelanders and consequently will brief his team on that premise. ''I
look at it this way. If we were down 3-1 we would be going at them hell
for leather. That is how I am sure they'll respond, too.''
It was at the insistence of the Akranes' players that the tie is being
played in their own little stadium, rather than in the national park
where more fans could be accommodated.
The reason is in a simple statistic: in five European games at their
own pitch since 1977, they have not been beaten and in fact have not
lost a goal. Maybe that record will be smashed tonight in front of the
predicted 2000 fans -- double the normal attendance -- and certainly
Rovers, who have won their last three games since losing heavily to
Rangers, are capable of that . . . and maybe a bit more.

With freaked-out parents, we can only freak in and understand AbFab's
Saffy, says ELEANOR HOUGHTON
* ''SOMETIMES I think my parents would be happier if I were a
lesbian,'' says Sarah. ''We could have been so understanding,'' they
told her. Sarah is a worry to her parents. Her nose isn't pierced, her
hair isn't pink, and she isn't shacked up with an anarchist drop-out.
She's a real disappointment.
Lucy's parents feel just as let down. ''It must be awful to be your
age and not sexually active,'' complained her mother. ''Why don't you go
out and have an affair or something? You're just like that Saffy from
Absolutely Fabulous.''
It seems Saffy, the boring daughter, has struck a chord with many a
progressive parent. To former hippies, today's generation of young
people are a sorry lot. What's the good of being understanding if their
children provide nothing for them to come to terms with?
Like AbFab's Edina, they dispair at their children's normality.
Whatever happened to the spirit of the Sixties and Seventies, they ask?
Nobody seems to rebel any more.
But, let's face it, rebellion was so much easier in those days. In
1962 The Beatles' moderate mop-tops were considered scandalously long,
presenting a serious threat to moral and social order. Hip kids had only
to abstain from visiting the barber for a couple of weeks to cause
consternation in the older generation. And punk rockers had it easy.
Comb half your hair with a razor, spike the rest, rip your jeans and put
a safety pin in your nose -- conspicuous rebellion in an instant.
In the 1990s, however, shock value doesn't come so cheap. Alan
describes seeing a punk recently: ''I looked at him and I wasn't
horrified, or impressed, or scared. I just thought he looked
old-fashioned.
''If you want to make a statement you can't just adopt any old rebel
uniform from the past. Drawing on history defeats the purpose.''
Greg agrees: ''The thing about rebellion is it has a very short
shelf-life. Doc Martens used to make a statement. They were clumsy, ugly
and scruffy, and parents hated them. Little by little they became a
student staple -- sensible, safe and predictable. Now 13-year-old
school-kids wear them.''
Grunge, the Punk of the Nineties, took a similar course. The ultimate
in laissez-faire grooming, it grew from an innovative Detroit music
scene, first popularised by Nirvana. To its followers it meant
mismatching layers of ancient, unkempt, but comfortable, clothes, and
huge savings on shampoo. Mums and Dads were aghast.
Then, disaster happened: Grunge went mainstream. Alan explains: ''The
minute you could actually buy 'Grunge' in the shops the look was dead.
Like punk, it wasn't just the clothes, it was the whole ethos that
mattered and, in both cases, DIY was the key.''
Rebellion? Once again the establishment had hijacked the vehicle of
youth and, in doing so, quelled the insurrection. Not only is it ever
more difficult to come up with something genuinely novel, then, but the
older generation is constantly snapping at youth's carefully frayed and
faded heel in the quest for cool.
Modern parents were in at the start of youth culture, after all, and
they are not about to buy a cardie and slippers, sit by the fire and let
the youngsters run the show. Higher living standards and improved health
means our parents have the time and energy for a groovy middle age, and
access to new trends via mass media let them keep up to date.
Hence the reverse rebellion trend. Sarah and Lucy might seem boring to
their forward-thinking parents, but think how revolutionary their
attitude is. Youth rebellion means turning parental expectations on
their heads, which is exactly what Sarah, Lucy and poor old Saffy have
done.
Note the similarity between the reaction to this new phenomenon and
good old-fashioned shock tactics: aggrieved parental haranguing and a
strong all-round sense of having let the side down.
Of course this effect can be achieved without actually having to be
boring. ''I've given up competing with my parents' hippy stories,'' says
Lucy, ''No matter what I do they act as if they did it three times
before breakfast in the good old days, so I keep quiet and let them
think the most exciting part of my day is bedtime cocoa. They keep their
feeling of trendy superiority and I don't have to suffer embarassing
chats with my mum about my sex life.''
Moreover, Greg suspects liberal attitudes are often no more than PC
posturing: ''My parents like to seem open-minded when somebody else's
child is in trouble, but if I got someone pregnant or dropped out of
university it would be a different story.''
And after all, times have changed. Economic realities make a good
education an imperative and HIV means careless experimentation with sex
and drugs is out of the question.
Added to this is the fact that today's society imposes far fewer
restraints. Many of the strictures that prompted our parents to rebel no
longer exist. In fact if Sarah and Lucy had lived in the Sixties their
''boring'' lifestyles would have seemed the hight of depravity.
Sarah seems to confirm this: ''What's the point of rebelling? I'm too
busy having a good time to bother.''

Changes in approaches to university education are having a profound
effect on students. Fraser Nelson comments on a survey that suggests a
serious erosion of the once-elite status of campus society
'Anyone who describes students as rich kids, political wackos or
druggies has completely lost touch with the complex character of
mid-Nineties campus life'
THE WORLD OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION is going through a complete
metamorphosis. In the last 10 years, the number of universities -- and
the number of students -- has doubled. The student grant, which levelled
the playing field between rich and poor, has collapsed, replaced by a
national network of debt.
Universities are in transit from being ivory towers of education to
market-led slipways into the commercial world. The face of Scottish
higher education is changing completely.
But how is this affecting the students? The Herald has commissioned a
wide-reaching survey of student attitudes across the country, to gauge
the impact that these education changes have made on campus life. The
results should make interesting reading for students, lecturers, the
Government and anyone connected to higher education in Scotland.
Campus life is now too diverse to support any of the traditional
student stereotypes. One in three young Scots is a student and over half
are ''mature'' students. There are now as many types of student as there
are types of people. Anyone who describes students as rich kids,
political wackos or druggies has completely lost touch with the complex
character of mid-Nineties campus life.
There is no straight answer to why students are at university. The
most popular approach to university is ''a place to get yourself
together and become focused''. But beyond that, the survey shows that
students diverge along three equally popular and completely different
approaches.
A slim 19% hold the traditional approach of seeing university as a
place to be taught by experts. Most of these students are looking to go
on to post-graduate study.
A sizeable minority sees university as ''a chance to doss about''.
They are usually dismissed as a waste of taxpayers' money and a relic
from the Sixties. But further probing reveals that they, too, are the
by-product of the modern education revolution.
One respondent preferred the title ''anti-careerist'' to ''dosser''.
''I hate yahs and try-hards,'' she elaborated. ''I'm not going to turn
out like them.'' So, the number of ''slackers'' remains high; but,
rather than drifting into this lifestyle, today's slacker is positively
choosing it.
The most important development revealed by the survey is the emergence
of a new breed of students: 20% of students now see university as ''a
springboard to a career if you make the right moves''. These students
aim to go into management or start their own business. But there is also
more to the student careerist than the statistics suggest . . .
Ben Wallace, a 22-year-old management student at Glasgow University,
describes himself as ''career conscious'', but not a child of Thatcher.
''I left school at 16 and, after working for five years, I knew there
was no time to mess about. Does that make me a fat capitalist?''
THE MOST SHOCKING fact uncovered by the survey is that today's
students are now distinguished not by their background, age or faculty,
but by whether they are rich or poor.
As many as 39% of the more comfortable students, who are not affected
by the cutbacks, are warming to the Government's loan scheme. But the
poorer ones are suffering, and are beginning to develop an entirely
different view of university.
Poorer students are half as likely to enjoy university as the
''comfortable''. The poorer student is four times as likely to have been
put in two minds about coming to university, twice as likely to have a
term-time job, and half as likely to view university as a springboard to
a career.
But, for the majority, the spectrum of student wealth ranges from
medium to low . . . 44% are ''coping'', and fewer than 25% describe
their financial situation as ''comfortable''. Nineties students are far
more likely to be pulling pints than propping up the union bar.
STUDENT LEADERS have reacted with anger to the Herald evidence that a
two-tier student population is emerging -- those who are coping
financially and those who are not.
NUS President Jim Murphy was not surprised. ''The survey has proved
once and for all that in every lecture theatre in Scotland there is a
growing underclass of one third of the student population who simply are
not coping.''
Edinburgh University Student Association President Zoe Heathcote was
disturbed by fact that 17% of students wanted a term-time job, but
couldn't find one. To combat this, she is setting up a student Job Shop
with the university career service.
''It is a sad fact of student life that we must provide this kind of
service'', she mused.
The Scottish Office, however, was ''encouraged'' by the survey. ''Most
students find university challenging but recognise it is a great
opportunity as well,'' said Raymond Robertson, Minister for Education.
However, he was disappointed that after 15 years of Tory rule, fewer
than 10% of students wanted to start their own business. ''I would like
to see more students considering this possibility,'' he admitted.
WHILE TODAY'S STUDENT may not be sure what he or she wants to do, they
are most certainly sure where they want to do it -- abroad. Seeking work
abroad was the most popular career choice, followed by Postgraduate
study, Media and Management.
Getting a job was the main aim of half of respondents, but 10% said
their main ambition after university was to have a decent social life. A
substantial 5% admitted their main aim was to have a ''decent boyfriend
or girlfriend''. Curiously, this figure was highest in the Engineering
faculty.
University has also lost it place as the arena of discovering
recreational drugs . . . 85% claimed to have taken illegal drugs, and
78% of these had done so before university. While Eighties Freshers
tried marijuana for the first time at uni, Nineties students are
arriving with their own plants.
There was only one statistic which stayed the same throughout
inter-faculty and inter-university divisions. Students, it seems, spend
48% of their disposable income on alcohol.
When asked what he wishes he had been told before university, a Dundee
respondent answered: ''That my liver would turn black.'' And Freshers'
Week is just the beginning. As many as 47% of First Years spend most of
their disposable money of drink. This creeps up to 55% for fourth years,
reaching an astonishing 64% for postgraduate students.
This leads to the most decisive result of the survey. We asked
students what was the best cure for hangovers. The answer: Barr's Irn
Bru, preferably flat and accompanied by a fry-up. Of those who offered a
cure, 89% cited Scotland's other national drink as the perfect remedy.

CLYDEBANK coach Brian Wright yesterday appealed for the supporters to
come out in numbers tonight to back his side in the Challenge cup.
Bankies face injury hit Dundee united with the winner going through to a
semi-final tie against either Dunfermline or Brechin, who are also in
action.
Said Wright: ''Our tie against St Johnstone in the last round was an
enjoyable match, but unhappily it did not get the numbers watching that
it deserved.''
Dundee United manager Billy Kirkwood will be forced into changes in
the Challenge Cup, with Paddy Connolly the latest on his increasing
injured list.
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton is set to make at least four changes
from the side beaten on Saturday, with Craig Robertson coming back to
face Brechin.

HOW does this page look to you? Is the paper brushing the tip of your
nose or do need another few inches on the length of your arms, to get
the print into sharper focus?
When eyes get tired more easily and sight starts to blur at the end of
the day, the optician's chair must beckon.
A full eye examination every two years is regarded as a sensible
health precaution. Apart from any deficiencies in sight, an optometrist
can also detect other health problems such as high blood pressure or
diabetes.
Those entitled to a free examination include children under 16 (under
19 in full-time education), those receiving Income Support or Family
Credit, those just above the Social Security benefit level, diabetics,
glaucoma sufferers and certain relatives, the blind and partially
sighted, and people entitled to NHS complex lens vouchers.
The NHS spectacles of old are no longer in existence, but those who
are deemed to need financial help with the purchase of spectacles
receive vouchers which can be put towards the cost.
Those NHS frames, some believe, are responsible for the stigma
attached to wearing spectacles in this country. The mood is changing
slowly, however, with forward-looking opticians importing the most
stylish frames from around Europe and developing lenses which are much
more slender and unobtrusive, no matter what degree of short or
long-sightedness they have to correct.
Pauline Masson opticians in Princes Square is more in tune with the
relaxed clothes shops which the centre is famous for rather than a
clinical opticians. This, explains co-owner Jez Levy, is a deliberate
move towards making spectacles more than a utilitarian visual aid.
''Although we are just as strict when it comes to the eye care side
such as testing and fitting for contact lenses, we believe it's
important that customers are exposed to the best choice of frames
possible. There is a stigma in this country attached to wearing
spectacles, but slowly, spectacles will be seen as part of a person's
whole image, rather than something which intrudes upon it.
Full-time spectacle wearers should consider at least a ''work'' pair
and a ''play'' pair which blend with their particular office and leisure
styles. Jez Levy hopes that people will come to regard spectacles in the
same way as they regard an item of jewellery.
''There are so many things which can be done to improve the cosmetic
effect. Reducing the thickness with mid index and high index lenses goes
a long way to giving a better effect -- it also makes the spectacles
lighter in weight and consequently more comfortable to wear.''
Anti-reflection coating is something which helps all spectacle
wearers. If your reflection is evident in a friend or relative's
spectacles, it's a fair bet that they don't have the coating. It could
help them see more clearly and make the lens tougher.
The increasing demands which are placed upon our eyes make regular eye
care more important. There is no agreement that increased use of Display
Screen Equipment such as Visual Display Units does any real harm but
insufficient rest from the screen, incorrect positioning and unsuitable
lighting can all lead to eye fatigue. An anti-reflection coating can
also help DSE users.
It's important that first-time and ''experienced'' spectacle wearers
find an optician who gives care and advice that satisfies them -- then
find a pair of spectacles which are part of your personal style rather
than something which obscures it.

FOR those who hated wearing spectacles, but couldn't cope without
them, the introduction of contact lenses was hailed as a minor miracle.
Although technology has developed, some opticians believe that contact
lenses should not be viewed as a full-time alternative to spectacles.
''Contact lenses should be worn in conjunction with spectacles,'' said
Jez Levy. ''They are fantastic things, but it's important that eyes are
given a break. We would recommend reducing contact lens wearing time to
no more than eight to ten hours a day, four or five days a week.''
Although, in most cases, the primary motivation behind wearing contact
lenses is vanity, there are other plus points. Lenses offer extremely
sharp vision, they don't fog up or smudge, and some types are excellent
for sporty types.
There are two basic types of lenses -- hard and soft. The most common
hard lenses are gas permeable, made from a firm plastic, which lets
oxygen through well. These can be easier to look after than their soft
counterparts. The majority of lenses now fall into the soft category,
with a wide choice within the range, including toric and high-water
content lenses.
An experienced contact lens fitter won't just recommend a lens on the
basis of eye shape, he or she will take into consideration lifestyle.
Good quality lenses come at a price, but there are easy-payment
schemes available which can be structured to include insurance and
replacement.

* DUTCH keeper Theo Snelders was warned yesterday that he will have to
fight to regain his place with Aberdeen, writes Ian Broadley.
Snelders lost the top spot when, because his wife gave birth to their
daughter before the Coca-Cola Cup tie with Motherwell last week, he
claimed he was not in the right frame of mind to play, but expected to
return at Kilmarnock at the weekend.
Instead, his understudy, Michael Watt, retained his place. Dons'
manager Roy Aitken yesterday denied there had been another row with
Snelders.
Aitken, who hammered Snelders with a record #4000 fine earlier in the
season for walking out before a friendly with Coventry City, insisted:
''Any suggestion of a row between us is simply mischief-making.
''I don't expect any player who is left out to be happy. But he is a
professional and must react positively.''
Snelders, who trained as normal yesterday, will have the chance to
stake his claim for a first-team return when he plays in the reserves
today against Kilmarnock.
Brian Grant, fully recovered from a third fracture to an arm, also
will make his comeback.

DAMAGE to crops in the Grampian area following intensive rainfall
earlier this month has been estimated at #26.5m in a report compiled for
the National Farmers' Union of Scotland by the Scottish Agricultural
College.
NFUS president John Ross told farmers in Elgin yesterday that the SAC
figures had been submitted to the European Commission and to Euro MPs in
support of the union's claim for compensation.
''The detail in the report confirms our worst fears,'' he said.
Peter Macdonald, president of Moray and Nairn NFU, said that harvest
losses would be very hard to make up. Earlier payment of subsidies would
help with cash flow. However, if farm income was down by #15,000 that
was a very big gap to plug.
At a ceremony to mark the completion of the #500,000 refurbishment of
Elgin Mart, Mr Ross said that reforms of the CAP meant that cattle from
the opening sale were going to ''real markets'' not intervention markets
as might have been the case three or four years ago.
The reformed CAP had achieved most of the aims set for it, he said.
His advice to those who classed themselves as radical thinkers and
advocated a totally free market in agriculture was to think long and
hard about that prospect.
''I am convinced that Europe will never be without an agricultural
policy of some kind,'' he said. It is about more than keeping farmers in
business, it is about the environment, local communities and the way
society wishes the countryside to be used.''
While accepting that the enlargement of the EU meant that there would
be strains on the system he took the view that there would have to be a
CAP for the foreseeable future.
George Ritch, chairman of the ANM group, operators of the new Elgin
Auction Centre said that he looked forward to a continued expansion in
the throughput of both cattle and sheep. The first phase of the
redevelopment provides tiered seating and new covered penning for 900
cattle. The second phase will include provision of a new large sales
hall for weekly furniture sales.

KALE, a traditional forage crop used by livestock farmers, is enjoying
a re-vamped image as a result of pioneering work carried out in Devon.
Dairy farmer Ron Patey and his son Malcolm have been using the crop for
silage and claim to have achieved excellent feeding value.
Their pioneering efforts have now been backed by seed company Sharpes
International who will be marketing the system next year under the brand
name Kaleage.
Martin Titley of Sharpes said: ''Kale has always offered dairy and
sheep farmers a high yield potential but its use has declined over the
past decade. Strip grazing with dairy cows in poor weather conditions
increased the risk of foot problems.''
The alternative of making silage in large black plastic bales had a
number of advantages, he said. ''By cutting and baling the kale crop in
late summer fields can be released for an autumn sowing. The wastage
factor associated with any strip-grazed crop is eliminated.''
Mr Titley pointed out that kale thrives on large quantities of
farmyard manure or slurry, making it a good dumping ground for such
material.
Ron Patey and his son, who farm 200 acres near Totnes, have been firm
believers in big-baling techniques for years and decided to evaluate the
possibilities of conserving kale in that way. Kale silage is now an
integral part of the feeding regime for their dairy herd.
Sharpes recommend that kale should be cut and wilted in late August or
early September when the stems are still very palatable. The crop is
then baled, wrapped and stored ready for future use.
An appropriate silage additive has to be used to ensure a rapid
fermentation which, in turn, promotes a stable and palatable feed.

Obree as our best bet.
Obree has breathed new life into his racing career after a series of

His main challengers in South America are likely to be Australian
champion Brad McGee, Italian Andrea Colinelli, a surprise winner against
Obree at the Manchester World Cup meeting, and Frenchman Philippe
Ermenault.
Obree, who twice broke the world one-hour record and won the rainbow

BRITAIN'S 44 million sheep play a vital role as environment improvers,
particularly in the hills and uplands, industry leaders claimed
yesterday.
And with an annual turnover of #3500m and over 250,000 jobs at stake
on both sides of the farm gate they are also a key economic factor in
many areas.
For these reasons, industry leaders want to keep incentives for
environmental objectives running alongside production support payments
rather than used as a substitute.
''Decoupling the two is an unacceptable option,'' said Joe Stoddart,
president of the National Sheep Association, at a London news conference
marking the issue of its new publication Sheep UK -- Our National Hidden
Asset.
''Provided the electorate as a whole gets value for money in terms of
prime lamb, wool and a well-cared-for sustainable countryside, the
natural renewable resources provided by sheep farming will continue to
be an essential part of the economy throughout the UK.''
The report, written by Joe Read, former head of sheep development with
the Meat and Livestock Commission, and Professor Ian Cunninham, formerly
principal of the West of Scotland College of Agriculture and director of
the Hill Farming Research Organisation, is aimed at providing a whole
picture of the stratified industry.
It is the basis for the NSA's submission to the Ministry of
Agriculture for the forthcoming rural white paper. It will also be sent
to MPs and other opinion formers.
It traces the development of the industry from the advent of the
European sheepmeat regime in 1980 when Britain was only 67%
self-sufficient in lamb and 44% self-sufficient in wool to 1993 when the
figures were 113% and 74% respectively.
During that time exports rose from #67m a year to nearly #370m. The
report says that exports are expected to account for up to 60% of total
production by the year 2000. John Thorley, NSA chief executive, admitted
that British Consumers were eating less lamb. ''But we are finding new
markets and all that we produce is being eaten.''
Continuing support payments to Britain's 90,000 sheep farmers are
vital, particularly in difficult hill and upland areas where these may
account for two-thirds of total farm income. Lowlands support payments
are running at about 25% with an average of 33% over the whole industry.
The report warns these figures may be expected to decrease, making it
more important that producers meet market requirements particularly on
product consistency, year-round supply and well-muscled leaner carcass
production. It also urges processors and retailers to be more innovative
in meeting consumer demand.

He added: ''We want to make that semi-final and we're going for it.
We've got the potential to go all the way.
''We've got good goaltending, some of the best defencemen in the
league and great fire-power up-front.''
The other tie in the Northern section features Durham Wasps and

WE SCOTS don't have that many world champions, as one of them, Stephen
Hendry, was pointing out the other day. He was not patting himself on
the back, and indeed he might have added that, in his own case, the
world title is undisputed.
Snooker does not have weight divisions, nor are there any rival
organisations to award different versions of the ''world'' title. Nor is
there much dispute now that he is the greatest player of all time.
His predecessor, Steve Davis, ruled the roost with mostly hit-and-run
tactics. But that generation of exponents of safety play -- Terry
Griffiths, Dennis Taylor, ''grinder'' Cliff Thorburn, and boring old
Eddie Charlton -- have been routed for a long time now by the
long-potters and break-builders, led by Hendry, Jimmy White, James
Wattana, and Ronnie O'Sullivan. We should also discount the only other
contender for the title of all-time best, multiple world champion Joe
Davis, who belonged to an era when his only requirement was to defend
his title each year against a solitary challenger, often nominated.
But Scotland's world champion, who won the Regal Masters at Motherwell
Civic Centre at the weekend for a record third time, could well be
dubbed ''one-visit Hendry''. He beat Peter Ebdon 9-5 in the final to
collect his fifty-fifth major title, and never in the history of the
sport has anyone so decisively and consistently put frames out of the
reach of bewildered, sedentary opponents.
''I wish I could always play as well as I have done this week and
that's the frustrating thing about my game,'' admitted the Scot, who
already was looking forward to the next event, which starts in Thailand
on Friday. ''I always try each season to get better and better but,
while I'm buzzing sometimes, that isn't always the case. You can't win
every frame with a century.''
The frightening thought occurs that Hendry does have a quest for
perfection, a desire to rise to an even higher pinnacle. After his
awesome 6-2 demolition of the hapless Darren Morgan in the semi-final at
Motherwell, during which Hendry achieved the 300th century of his
remarkable career, I asked him if there were any aspects of his game
that he was not completely happy with. He confessed that some of his
safety shots were not as good as he would have liked, and I suppose
that's why he won by ''only'' 6-2 instead of 6-0.
That performance surely was as close to perfection as one is likely to
see. His frame-winning breaks of 129, 136, 77, 91, and 116 in the space
of eight frames followed a similar purple patch in the second half of
his quarter-final against Nigel Bond. Together, that made nine
frame-clinching breaks, including four centuries, in 13 frames.
Perhaps just how intimidating the Scot can be is best expressed by
opponents. Morgan said after his 6-2 defeat: ''Stephen was playing like
a machine. I don't care who he would have played -- that was
unbelievable snooker. It was the best anyone has ever played against me.
If you could guarantee that he was going to play like that against me
next time, I'd just stay in the house and watch him playing. It would
save me a journey.''
Ebdon said after the final: ''I've lost to a great, great player --
arguably the best there has ever been.''

profits by 20% to #617,000 with the dividend moving up a like proportion
to 1.2p.
The company which owns the Fort Matilda industrial estate in Greenock
is thought likely to make a fairly large acquisition over the next three
months.
Its share price is currently dominated by the requirement from the
Stock Exchange that Channel Hotels and Properties has to reduce its
current 36% holding to under 30% by the year-end.
Although gearing is about 160%, interest cover is a healthy 1.7 times
while there is speculative attraction in the #20m of tax losses to be
carried forward. Net asset value is put at 9p compared with the 7p share
price.

ALEX McLeish has warned Rangers that Borussia Dortmund may resort to
shady tactics to win tomorrow night's Champions' League tie at Ibrox.
Motherwell had two players, Rab Shannon and Dougie Arnott, ordered off
last season when they played the Germans in the UEFA Cup. ''I have
discussed Dortmund with Walter Smith and warned him that they will try
and influence the referee with gamesmanship,'' said McLeish.
''I was disappointed that a team of their calibre should stoop to such
methods to get players booked and red-carded. It was premeditated on
their part. Their players went down as if the were shot when tackled,
yet were able to sprint all over the park within minutes.
''They surrounded the ref in packs to insist he took action and
protest about our tackles. The Scots are branded as physical opponents
throughout the Continent and pay a heavy price at times. Rangers must
ensure they stand up for themselves and don't let the referee be
conned.''
McLeish is convinced Rangers can keep their European hopes alive if
they shackle Dortmund's Andy Moller. ''With their strike force of
Stephane Chapuisat and Karl-Hienz Riedle out injured, he is the one they
will look to for inspiration. Yet Moller is a difficult player to mark.
He drifts between attack and midfield, possesses and powerful shot in
either foot, and can create openings. If Rangers can subdue him they
have a chance of winning.
On the night, 1-0 is all they need. They just have to be patient. ''It
is also important that Rangers don't put Dortmund on a pedestal,'' added
McLeish, ''as we Scots are prone to do when up against household names.
We went to watch what we thought were a team of supermen last season and
Dortmund were turned over 4-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt with Anthony Yeboah
ripping them apart.
''Fortunately for Rangers he will be playing in the sweeper's role. He
is more dangerous in midfield with his shooting ability. But he is ever
willing to break to support his attack and Ally McCoist, or whoever,
must be prepared to check his run.

<TEXT>
Washington, Monday -- Federal Reserve policy-makers, buoyed by a
brightening US economic outlook, are expected to keep on the same course
and hold US interest rates steady when they meet here tomorrow,
economists said.
With the economy picking up speed and inflation becalmed, the central
bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has no reason to
fiddle with short-term rates this week, they said.
''When the dials are apparently set so accurately, why change them?''
asked Robert Dederick, chief economist at Chicago-based Northern Trust
Company.
Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said as much on Friday, telling lawmakers
that the economy was looking up and that growth was not being held back
by high short-term interest rates.
''On the whole, the near-term prospects for the economy have improved
in recent months,'' he said.
The Fed cut short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly
three years in July, trimming the federal funds rate that commercial
banks charge each other for money by a quarter percentage point, to
5[3/4]%.
But it has held rates steady since then as the economy has shown signs
of shaking off a second-quarter slowdown.
In his semi-annual testimony to Congress last week on the health of
the economy, Greenspan said he expected growth to pick up this quarter
as strong stock and bond markets fuel consumer and corporate spending.
''He's much more confident now that the economy is on track,'' said
David Jones, vice-chairman of Wall Street broker Aubrey G Lanston &amp; Co.
''He feels no urgency about going any further on interest rates.''
Many financial analysts still expect the Fed to trim rates once more
this year, although some, including Jones, believe that the next move is
more likely to be up than down to help keep the economy -- and inflation
-- on a short leash.
The trigger for another rate cut, if there is one, could be a deal
between the Republican-led Congress and the Clinton administration to
balance the federal budget. -- Reuter.

HOPE can be found in adversity provided you look hard enough, and
rather than panic at the prospect of being without key defenders Richard
Gough and David Robertson for tomorrow night's Champions' League match
against Borussia Dortmund at Ibrox, Walter Smith will demand a positive
reaction from the able bodied.
If he has to go into battle without two stalwarts the Rangers manager
is likely to go for broke by instructing his players to launch a
full-scale offensive against the Germans.
There would, as he acknowledged, be little point in asking a team to
be defensively minded if that team's best defenders are unavailable, and
Borussia, who arrive in Glasgow around lunch time today, would relish
the opportunity to test the validity of a second-choice back division.
Players like Andy Moller, Matthias Sammer, Stefan Reuter, and the
wonderfully gifted striker, Ruben Sosa, are serious threats to any side,
even one with a full and able-bodied complement and the Germans, who
lost their opening match at home to Juventus, believe they must now win
away from home to repair the damage caused by the Italians.
Although the Bundesliga side have been in erratic mood their spirits
are lifted by news of Smith's woes.
Also despite the claim of Borussia's coach, Ottmar Hitzfeld, that
Rangers will be better off without Mark Hateley, there should be little
doubt the Germans are pleased they won't be coming up against the
Englishman, who signed yesterday for Queen's Park Rangers.
However, even if he hadn't been transferred, Hateley would have been
unable to play tomorrow night because he still is on the mend after
ankle and knee surgery.
Hateley, who signed on at Ibrox five years ago for #1m, has gone for
the same fee, even though he is now 33, but his new manager and former
Ibrox and England team-mate Ray Wilkins says: ''His experience will be
an enormous help here and our younger forwards can learn from him.
Having him at QPR was something I'd wanted since I became manager.''
Hateley, who signed a two-and-a-half year contract, added: ''I'd
reached the stage at Ibrox where I thought it was coming to an end for
me, and I must always have targets, ambitions, and rewards. The
Premiership has turned into a great stage in the last couple of years
and I'm looking forward to the new challenge of playing in it
immensely.''
As well as the injury problems hampering Gough and Robertson, another
defender, Alan McLaren, is suspended for the match and the manager is
not sure about the fitness of Stuart McCall.
The midfield player has not played in any of the last five games
because of knee ligament trouble, and although he trained yesterday
there can often be a delayed, adverse reaction with such injuries, and
even if McCall reports back fit and well, it might be asking too much of
him to resume in such a crucial match.
Again, though, Smith might have little choice, especially since
McCall's versatility -- he could be used at full back -- might make him
an attractive alternative, but with Ian Ferguson fit again McCall might
have to wait.
The problems at the back are intensified further because the
Australian, Craig Moore, who could step in at full back or midfield,
would leave Smith with only two more slots for foreigners, and it is
certain two of those places will be taken by Gordan Petric and Brian
Laudrup.
The third place will go to either Paul Gascoigne or Oleg Salenko with
the English internationalist favourite.
He and Laudrup were purchased for contests like the one which now
faces Rangers, who lost their first Champions' League game in Bucharest
a fortnight ago, and much will depend on their contributions, which have
been minimal so far.
Gordon Durie, whose goal against Anorthosis Famagusta at Ibrox was
enough to give Rangers a winning edge in the preliminary round, is
likely to partner Ally McCoist up front, but scoring in competitive
European matches has been a problem for Smith's team. In fact, they have
scored only once in their last five games, hardly a strike-rate designed
to put fear into the hearts of opposing defenders.
''We are left poorly in terms of defenders,'' Smith said, ''and if we
are hit with the worst scenario, which would be losing Gough and
Robertson, whose chances of being fit are 50-50, then I would have to do
a lot of reshuffling.
''Even before the Champions' League started I was always aware we
could run into this kind of problem, but I didn't expect I would be
coping with it this early.''
The manager added that while he knows which three foreigners will be
playing, he has no idea of the identities of those who will be deployed
around that trio because of the injury problems. However, he will be
looking at the likes of Alex Cleland, Brian Reid, and Gary Bollan, who
will all have been placed on standby.

EDINBURGH-based fund management group Ivory &amp; Sime is doubling the
size of its development capital operation with the #3.1m acquisition,
announced yesterday, of London-based Baronsmead.
The deal had been expected.
Ivory &amp; Sime's existing development capital business, in the form of
its #80m Enterprise Capital investment trust, will be incorporated
within Baronsmead, which also manages about #80m.
The enlarged operation, to be known as Ivory &amp; Sime Baronsmead, will
be headed by Baronsmead managing director Richard Hargreaves. The
Midlands and South of England will be covered from the existing London
office of Baronsmead, with development capital deals in Scotland and the
North of England dealt with by Ivory &amp; Sime's Edinburgh office.
Ivory &amp; Sime will pay for Baronsmead, which has a team of 12
professionals, through the issue of 1,365,638 Ordinary shares. With a
few of Baronsmead's private shareholders having opted for cash rather
than shares, 135,610 of these shares have been placed with Ivory &amp;
Sime's major shareholder, the Cayzer family's Caledonia Investments, at
227p.
As a result of the share issue, Caledonia's stake in Ivory &amp; Sime will
be diluted from 29.2% to 28.4%.
Baronsmead, which provides established private companies with equity
capital, runs the Barclays Baronsmead Fund on behalf of the ''big four''
bank. It also manages the Baronsmead Investment Trust, which invests in
unquoted UK companies primarily with market values of up to #10m.
Later this week, Baronsmead will launch a #15m venture capital trust
and it is also planning an Alternative Investment Market trust.
In the year to end-December, Baronsmead made pre-tax profits of
#436,000 on revenues of #2.26m. It had net liabilities of #489,000.
Ivory &amp; Sime managing director Colin Hook believed the enlarged
development capital operation could be considered to be of ''optimal
mass''.
He added that the acquisition, which comes a couple of months after
the #6.85m purchase of the investment trust-focused Clan Asset
Management, was ''part of what we hope is a carefully orchestrated plan
to strengthen Ivory &amp; Sime and return it to its premier position in
Scotland''.
There have been major changes at Ivory &amp; Sime in recent months,
including the shake-up of its flagship British Assets and related
Investors Capital investment trusts, the launch of the Discovery fund
and the merger of Selective Assets into the more successful British
Empire Securities and General Trust, which was acquired as part of Clan.
Yesterday it was announced that the holders of 79.6% of Selective had
accepted British Empire's share offer by the first closing date of
Saturday. Caledonia, which has increased its stake in Selective from
0.7% to 9.3%, has accepted the offer, which has been extended until
October 6.
At end-April, Ivory &amp; Sime had funds under management of #3100m.
Another #240.5m came from Clan, and, with the #80m from Baronsmead and
recent stock-market appreciation, Mr Hook is relatively pleased with the
way the funds total is advancing.
Shares in Ivory &amp; Sime were yesterday unchanged at 226p.
* MERCURY Asset Management has appointed Christopher McNeil to head a
new Scottish regional office in Edinburgh.
Mr McNeil, who recently joined MAM from Save &amp; Prosper, will be
responsible for building up institutional and retail business in
Scotland with particular emphasis on the Independent Financial Advisers
market. London-based MAM has #63bn of funds under management.

ROBBIE Fowler could land a lone strike role tonight as Liverpool look
to polish off UEFA Cup rivals Vladikavkaz -- and give Anfield more
European glory.
Goals from Steve McManaman and Jamie Redknapp have given Liverpool a
2-1 cushion, and now Liverpool manager Roy Evans, wary of the Russians'
counter-attacking potential, may employ a safety-first system.
At the City Ground, Frank Clark's Nottingham Forest, 2-1 down against
a confident Malmo side, will be hoping that their fans can help them
reach the next round.
''We'll see how confident Malmo are once they get out there in what
will be a white-hot atmosphere,'' said Clark, who is looking to his
striker Bryan Roy for something special.
''Bryan is frustrated he hasn't scored in the last four games,'' said
the manager, ''but is important he does well for us now.''

MANCHESTER United will hope that Andy Cole can convert their goalless
away draw into a UEFA Cup success against Rotor Volgograd tonight.
Cole, who missed the first leg in Russia, and Roy Keane, hurt in the
first game, could feature after having come through a training session.
Manager Alex Ferguson believes that Cole's pace and eye for a
half-chance will prove the key to unlock the Rotor defence and send
United through to the second round.
Leeds are in a strong position, with a 3-0 lead over Monaco from the
first leg, but United manager Howard Wilkinson has warned his team to
take nothing for granted.
''History shows that anything is possible,'' said Wilkinson. ''Monaco
have scored four goals at St Etienne and Bordeaux. They have a decent
away record and they are a club I respect.''

EDINBURGH Fund Managers Group yesterday announced a fall in interim
pre-tax profits from #7.39m to #6.52m, in spite of the recent strength
of the London and New York stock markets.
However, the setback was in line with comments made by managing
director Iain Watt when the company announced a 40% rise in annual
profits to a record #13.7m in March.
The interim dividend was held at 8p.
Funds under management fell from #3437m to #3285m during the six
months to end-July.
Profits were hit by a drop in first-half fund management income from
#11.7m to #9.65m and in net profits from unit trust trading from #1.15m
to #415,000.
Chairman Colin Ross said the drop in earnings per share, from 26.7p to
23.1p, was in line with other fund management companies.
He said share prices in Far Eastern and Latin American markets,
important sources of management fees, had not returned to the levels of
a year ago.
The Pacific region accounts for 23% of funds under management, with
another 9% in the recently-troubled Japanese market and 3% in Latin
America.
However, Mr Ross highlighted the reduction in first-half
administrative expenses from #5.90m to #5.07m.
On July 7, Edinburgh Fund Managers sold its private client management
business to Invesco Private Portfolio Management. First-half operating
profits from the discontinued business were #37,000, compared with
#304,000 last year.
The UK accounts for 49% of the group's funds under management, and
North America 11%.
Shares in Edinburgh Fund Managers showed little reaction to the fall
in profits, losing only 1p to 723p.

* MURRAY Johnstone's new venture capital trust has raised #18.4m
through a placing sponsored by Smith New Court Corporate Finance.
Murray Johnstone director Iain Tulloch said capital for the new trust,
called Murray VCT, was raised entirely on the retail market through over
200 firms of private client advisers.
The share register will open with approximately 1100 individual
investors and dealings in Murray VCT will begin on the stock exchange on
Thursday.
It is one of several venture capital trusts being set up under new
government regulations to encourage the growth of small and medium-sized
unquoted companies.
The new trusts are aimed at plugging the ''equity gap'' of firms that
need a bigger capital base to expand, but are not big enough to go for a
flotation.

FORTUNES in golf can change with such bewildering speed that it
becomes difficult to reconcile one set of circumstances with another and
make any sense of them. The most recent example until Sunday was in the
Walker Cup match, won at Royal Porthcawl by Britain and Ireland this
month within two years of a combined side having been comprehensively
demolished at Interlachen.
Similarly, in the afterglow of Europe's victory over the United States
in the Ryder Cup match, the memory has to be jogged to recall the
scepticism which surrounded the final composition of the team. Too old,
too injury-prone, not arrived at in the best way and the selection
system made to look inept by the saga dogging Ian Woosnam's late
substitution for Jose Maria Olazabal. The unexpected is the oxygen,
maybe the justification for sport.
Golf is not an overtly emotional game. The pressures are internal in
the routine four-round professional tournament, which does comparatively
little for the game's image as a public entertainment so lethargic is
the pace of play. It tends to repeat one person's jaundiced view that
''golf is the most tedious game played outdoors in daylight.''
But the flesh-and-blood element of team matchplay brings out hidden
assets and reserves in players accustomed to the other discipline. Not
only that, but spectators' reaction to events is warmer and more
unbridled. Although naturally the great preponderance of support was for
the American side, the best shots of Europes players were as fully
appreciated.
Oddly, both teams could have been stronger. Olazabal's foot injury was
an obvious setback particularly given his largely successful partnership
with Seve Ballesteros. There also was a strong lobby for including
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, a committed US Tour player who has begun to
assemble genuine credentials.
On the American side there was equally emphatic support for Lee Janzen
and some also favoured John Daly, if for no other reason than that if
Oak Hills' examination might have been too unremittingly rigorous for
the gipsy-like tendency of his shot, the Open Champion deserved the
recognition due to his title.
The Americans, however, must lie on the bed they make for themselves,
as must the Europeans. Their captain, Bernard Gallacher, was on this
occasion proved right for his adherence to 10 places gained on points,
supplemented by his own two selections. Future leaders may not always be
so correct -- or so fortunate.
It became easy to criticise by hindsight the preference of the
American captain, Wadkins for his friend and contemporary Curtis
Strange, aged 40, over other and younger candidates. His choice surely
backfired on him as Strange lost all three of his matches most crucially
to Nick Faldo when he bogeyed the last three holes.
Faldo's crucial contribution in beating Strange with two closing par
figures would not have counted without the help of two of Europe's most
quirky characters, Howard Clark and Mark James. Not having played since
the first foursomes and put out second and third behind Ballesteros,
they appeared to be sacrificial lambs; instead they led their opponents
to the slaughter.
In that respect all credit is due to Gallacher, and whoever he may
have consulted, for devising so successful a line-up which at first
glance carried a striking resemblance to a suicide note. Instead his
troops, from their uneasy trapdoor position of being two points behind,
peremptorily silenced their leader's critics.
If more European professionals of standing were, like Faldo and
Parnevik, to transfer their basic loyalties to the US Tour it would,
however, make sense to allow the captain four wild cards.
The places gained automatically should not be seen to be the reward
for, as it were, perfect attendance in Europe. The only valid reason for
holding the match is to enter the strongest possible side and if noses
are put out of joint, so be it.
There is a dismaying tendency among the 30-somethings neither to
sustain nor advance careers which either have marked time or have
declined from a position of promise.
Last week the PGA European tour proudly published figures extolling
the fact that 44 members had earned more than #1m in prize-money.
Interestingly, four of that number comprised Ronan Rafferty, aged 31,
Barry Lane, aged 35, Steven Richardson, aged 29, Peter Baker, aged 28,
and Paul Broadhurst, aged 30, all with only one match to their names.
But two years on, others will have to be knocking at the door because
Clark, James, and Sam Torrance will all be well into their forties and
Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ballesteros and Woosnam will have reached their
fifth decades. Health and form permitting, Colin and Montgomerie and
Olazabal will be in the team, the linch-pins of it, no less.
Certainly, the pressures of the match have become, in Gallacher's own
description, ''almost too much to bear.'' But that is the acceptable
face of success in modern sport. Professional golfers, in contrast with
the gladiatorial element present in other major sports, really have a
quiet life.
For the first time in seven encounters, dating back to 1983, when the
Ryder Cup began to become a contest between equals instead of one of
predictable lop-sidedness, Europe found themselves neither ahead nor
tied for the lead going into the final day's play.
What further deepened misgivings over the final outcome, facing
opposition customarily stronger in depth than themselves, was the
statistic that even so, only once in the previous six matches had Europe
been able to win a singles series -- in 1985, when the United States
lost for the first time for 28 years.
That was pressure of the extreme sort. Faldo later told Montgomerie
that, in the climax of his match-winning duel with Strange, he was,
''almost not quite there'' in the sense that he did not fully realise
what he was about or what winning his game would mean to the team --
''not that I wanted to be told anyway,'' Faldo declared emphatically.

THE rift which appears to have opened up between Tommy Burns and John
Collins at Celtic Park will not be allowed to damage Celtic's chances of
moving into the next round of the European Cup-winners' Cup, and if the
manager believes the midfield player's presence is essential, then he
will play against Batumi on Thursday night writes James Traynor
It looks certain that Collins will be leaving Celtic as soon as an
appropriate offer comes in -- Burns probably would accept #3m -- but the
manager will not hesitate to recall the player who was relegated to the
reserves last Saturday after having spoken out about his position within
the club.
Burns later had his say, but made it clear Collins had not played his
last game for the first team, and yesterday the assistant manager, Billy
Stark, added: ''It's too early to say if Collins will be playing on
Thursday, but the manager has said the door won't be shut on him.''
Celtic are concerned about Phil O'Donnell, Pierre van Hooydonk, and
Andreas Thom, who are all injured, and it would be foolish at this stage
to deny themselves the services of Collins because he and the manager
are not seeing eye to eye on his future.

BUMPER crowds are expected at this week's Smurfit European Open near
Dublin. With all but two of the triumphant Oak Hill line-up expected at
the start of the event on Thursday -- Severiano Ballesteros and Nick
Faldo will be absent -- officials are bracing themselves for
record-breaking attendances at Kildare Country Club.
''This is the first time the event has been to Ireland, but we're
expecting to beat the previous best which is around 70,000,'' explained
Jamie Birkmyre, general manager of the European Open. ''From the very
moment we opened our office this morning, the phone hasn't stopped
ringing.''
Interest in the annual event has grown further with the key role
played at Oak Hill by Dublin-born 33-year-old Philip Walton, whose
singles win over Jay Haas clinched only the second European success on
American soil in Ryder Cup history -- and he is sure to be greeted as a
returning hero.
''We've been inundated with requests ever since Europe's victory,''
admitted Birkmyre. ''The fact that Philip Walton won the deciding game
just added to the interest. The Guinness sales will be going through the
roof during the event. There will be non-stop parties.''
* EVEN the Duke of York had the chance to hold the Ryder Cup as he
joined Europe's victorious team on their Concorde flight back to Dublin
and then London yesterday.
''To have been invited to witness this great sporting achievement is a
moment to savour,'' said Prince Andrew, a keen golfer who followed all
the action at Oak Hill and was even kitted out in official team clothes.
There was no chance of a lie-in after the victory dinner. The
specially-chartered Concorde flew out of Rochester yesterday morning
carrying the entire team -- all bar Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros are
playing in this week's European Open in Ireland -- their wives or
girlfriends and a number of dignitaries.
European tour executive director Ken Schofield said he could not put a
figure on the value of the win for the European Tour. ''It's a different
situation to when he won back the cup in 1985 because we were a young
Tour then,'' he said.
Prize-money in 1984 was only #3.4m. Next season, with a Seniors Tour
and secondary Challenge Tour in place, it is expected to reach #30m.
* DEFENDING champion Ian Young, of Braid Hills, will face Gary
Collinson, of Windyhill, in the first round of the revived Edinburgh
Crystal Scottish Daily Express SPGA Matchplay championship, which starts
tomorrow at Glasgow Gailes.
In the draw announced yesterday, another previous winner, John Chillas
of Glenbervie, will line up against Dalmahoy's Stuart Callan when
Scotland's top professionals try their hand at matchplay after an
absence of four years.
Lee Vannet, of Carnoustie, and Russell Weir, of Cowal, who both
finished in the top four of last year's money list, also clash in the
first round. The re-vamped competition, which has been played only twice
before, in 1990 and 1991, will carry a top prize of #4500 and will
feature a pre-tournament pro-am today.
* CAWDER'S Alan Tait battled against gale force winds and driving rain
to win the Peter Scott Knitwear/Hawick Pro-Am at Hawick yesterday. The
Scottish Assistants' champion was the only player to break par across
the 5929-yard course with a three-under-par 31 inward half giving him a
one-under-par 67 and a three-stroke cushion over David Thomson, of
King's Links. Leading scores:
67 -- A Tait (Cawder). 71 -- D Thomson (Kings Links). 72 -- E McIntosh
(Braid Hills), D Drysdale (Dunbar). 73 -- B Dunbar (Easter Moffat), C
Brooks (Glencorse). 74 -- B Lockie (Kilmarnock Barassie), S Kerr
(Renfrew), A McCloskey (Airdrie), C Ronald (East Kilbride), C Everett
(Caldwell), L Vannet (Carnoustie), S Stephen (Braid Hills), K Hutton
(Downfield). Team: 58 -- B Dunbar (Easter Moffat) J Scott, B George, G
Davidson.
* IN an all-West and windy final, Glasgow High School FP beat 1990
winners Hutchesons' Grammar School FP 2-1 to win the forty-third annual
Queen Elizabeth Coronation Schools Foursomes Trophy at Royal Burgess,
Edinburgh, yesterday for a record ninth time. Details:
I Carslaw and K Macnair lost to A Young and G Cox, 3 and 2; A Neilson
and A Fergusson beat G Baird and J Crawford, 2 and 1; K Macintosh and S
Pascal beat I Danskin and F Alexander, at 20th.

Dundee 1, Stenhousemuir 3
TERRY Christie's Ochilview heroes wrote another chapter in their cup
success story with another night of glory at Dens Park last night. The
Warriors roared their way past the inept challenge of first division
Dundee to earn themselves a League Challenge Cup semi-final tie against
either Livinston or Stirling Albion.
Dundee, without six regulars through injury, found themselves swamped
by an impressive tide of visiting attacks.
Dundee defender Kevin Bain deflected a fourth minute Gareth Hutchison
cross past his own keeper Paul Mathers for the opener.
Two minutes into the second half, Ian Little scored. Cargill appeared
to have breathed some life into the home cause when pulling back a goal
on the hour mark. But Stenhousemuir clinched the match in style. Miller
Mathieson survived three challenges in a surging 75-yard solo run before
rounding keeper Mathers and netting.
DUNDEE -- Mathers, Matheson, M Hutchison, J Duffy, Cargill, McBain,
Anderson, Bain, Dailly, Hamilton, McCann. Substitutes -- Cadger, Shaw,
Britton.
STENHOUSEMUIR -- McKenzie, Bannon, Haddow, Armstrong, McGeachie,
Sprott, Hunter, Fisher, Mathieson, G Hutchison, Little. Substitutes --
Aitken, Logan, Henderson.

STIRLING County will use their Royal showpiece game against the
Barbarians today as a another building block in the drive to put their
premiership campaign in good order.
The Scottish champions, who were due to carry out fitness tests on
weekend casualties Jim Brough and Stewart Hamilton last night, were
faced with the option of throwing caution to the winds and serving up
champagne fare, or of treating the game, at Stirling Albion's Forthbank
Stadium (k.o. 4pm), as a serious test of their mettle.
Coach Brian Edwards explained yesterday: ''We've decided to stick to
the pattern that we've been trying to play this season. Obviously we
hope that it will still be entertaining but we'll be seeking a win
rather than throwing all caution to the winds.
The Barbarians' side, captained by Gavin Hastings, shows four changes
to that announced last week. Simon Geoghegan, Cameron Glasgow, Paul
Arnold and Craig Chalmers have all withdrawn because of injury, but the
Baa Baas have still put together a strong selection.
Of particular interest will be the appearance of Gregor Townsend at
fly-half in place of Chalmers (hamstring). This will be Townsend's first
appearance in Scotland since injury at the end of last season and a
summer spent in Australia with the Warringah club.
The match, for which a capacity crowd of 6000 is expected, represents
only the third time that the Barbarians have played a Scottish club
side. It will, too, be played in the presence of SRU patron, the
Princess Royal, whose son Peter Phillips will captain Gordonstoun School
against the Stirling County under-18 side in a curtain-raiser for the
main event. Teams:
Stirling County -- C M Sangster; A S M Turner, I C Jardine, M N
McGrandles, K M Logan; M McKenzie, K G M Harper; Forwards from J J
Manson, J Gibson, K D McKenzie, G B Robertson, J S Hamilton, G Douglas,
M Norval, E Elliot, J Brough, G N Flockhart.
Barbarians -- A G Hastings (Watsonians and Scotland); N Woods
(Blackrock, Ireland), J Bell (Northampton, Ireland), G Thomas (Bridgend,
Wales), R Subbianni (Bedford); G P J Townsend (Northampton, Scotland), B
W Redpath (Melrose, Scotland); K Colclough (Swansea), T J Kingston
(Dolphin, Ireland), G F Halpin (London Irish, Ireland), G Prosser
(Pontypridd), S D Shaw (Bristol), A J Charron (Ottoway Irish, Canada), D
W Peters (Bath, Scotland), I R Morrison (London Scottish, Scotland).
Replacements -- R McBride (Llanelli), R Pask (Abertillery), S Paul
(Heriot's FP), G H Oliver (Hawick, Scotland).

RICHARD Corsie survived a scare in Preston yesterday before swelling
the Scottish contingent in the second round of the Saga International
Open to five when he hit back to beat Welsh internationalist Robert
Weale 2-7, 7-5, 7-0.
Corsie kept intact the 100% record of the Scots after opening-day wins
for Alex Marshall, Paul Conlan, Willie Wood, and David Gourlay, but had
to dig deep for this victory.
With Corsie struggling with his opening two deliveries, Weale took the
opening set 7-2, and then moved 5-4 ahead in the second. ''At that point
I was there for the taking -- I had been playing catch-up bowls for most
of the match and putting myself in a lot of bother with slack opening
deliveries,'' said Corsie.
The Edinburgh man, however, found the perfect answer with three shots
on the seventh end of the second set, giving him a 7-5 success, and he
followed that with a count of 4 on the opening end of the decider.
Corsie needed just two more ends to wrap up his win with a single on
the second end followed by a double on the third.
''During the early stages I was just playing to keep in the game and
was getting more and more frustrated as Robert kept getting good results
with his running bowls -- I'm just pleased to still be in the event,''
said Corsie.
Earlier, defending champion Mark McMahon, the Scots-born man from Hong
Kong, won through in three sets against reigning British women's
champion Mary Price.
McMahon took the opening set 7-3, but lost a 6-2 lead in the second as
Price hit back with counts of 3 and 2 to sntach the set 7-6. However,
McMahon went on to take the decider 7-2.
''I was under pressure, and when Mary started with singles at the
first two ends of the deciding set, I knew it wasn't going to be easy,''
said McMahon.
Crown green man David Holt, who is also a flat green internationalist,
claimed his second-round berth when he beat New Zealand Rowan Brassey
7-2, 7-4.
Later, world champion Andy Thomson was pushed to the limit last night
before scraping home a 6-7, 7-3, 7-4 winner over Welsh internationalist

THE Flat season at Hamilton ended on a high note for Ayr trainer Linda
Perratt yesterday when she had the 33-1 winner.
Five of the 16 runners in the apprentices race came from Cree Lodge
and Leading Princess was an all-the-way winner for the stable, closely
followed by Mister Westsound.
It also was a big occasions for 20-year-old apprentice jockey Angela
Gallimore, who rode her first winner from 35 mounts. Mister Westsound's
jockey Carl Lowther, who drove his mount hard in the final furlong, was
less fortunate, being banned for two days for excessive use of the whip.
Pleased with her success, Perratt said: ''I had five in the race
because they are all sprinters and this was the last chance of a run in
Scotland until the November meeting at Edinburgh.''
She said that Diet had been the choice of the stable and Leading
Princess was something of a surprise. The four-year-old was ''desperate
for a cut in the ground'' and relished the rain-soaked track, the
trainer explained.
Keep Your Distance, easy winner of claimer, appears to enjoy racing in
Scotland. His success was his fourth victory from five starts, all of
them on Scottish tracks.
Kevin Darley held him up in the early stages but when he took the lead
two furlongs out the result was never in doubt.
It was owner Peter Savill's thirty-fourth winner of the season and he
confessed: ''I never thought this one would win four on the trot.''
He may run the gelding again at Lingfield on Thursday. After that it
will be back to a winter campaign over hurdles.
Despite a lay off of four months, Art of War was too good for his five
rivals in the conditions race. Roger Charlton's runner was last in the
Greenham Stakes behind Celtic Swing, but since then has been gelded. He
tracked the leading four until coming through approaching the final
furlong and going on to beat Sub Zero by four lengths.
Newmarket trainer Stuart Williams boasts an outstanding strike rate at
Hamilton and he made it six wins there from just 12 runners when
saddling Ayunili to capture the Bill McHarg Memorial Handicap in
clear-cut style.
Jockey Jeff Marshall signed off with a winner, only his second of the
year, on Eric's Bett, who sprang a shock in the maiden. Marshall leaves
for Cyprus today for a six-months riding stint. ''I have found things
difficult in Britain since losing my allowance earlier this year,'' said
Marshall.

TAKE the early price about Seckar Vale in the Hunter Price Handicap at
Newmarket this afternoon.
After a some lacklustre, early efforts, trainer Jack Hanson decided to
geld Seckar Vale and, after he refused to enter the stalls at Ripon in
August, sent him to Barry Hills for a change of scenery.
The benefits were seen when Seckar Vale ran at Doncaster earlier this
month. He had trouble in running but finished strongly to be fourth
behind Out On A Promise.
Hanson has maintained that Seckar Vale would come into his own over a
mile and a half, which is what he gets for the first time today, and
with Willie Carson booked, Seckar Vale looks a snip.
In the opening race, Lady Lacey could spring a surprise. Toby
Balding's eight-year-old always comes from off the pace but is not a
difficult ride and could pounce late at the right moment, while trainer
David Loder has good prospects of lifting the #25,000-added Tattersalls
Houghton Stakes with Rio Duvida.

PUNTERS have put their faith in experience as veteran Rambo's Hall was
the day's best-backed horse for the Cambridgeshire, for which 64 entries
have been announced.
Jeremy Glover's runner is going for an unprecedented third win in the
race, having captured the prize in 1992 and '89, after having been sold
to race in the USA in the interim.
One bookmaker reported support for Rambo's Hall, who is now joint
third favourite in the ante-post lists at 9-1, having been 12-1 when
doors opened for trading.
Glover recently issued punters with a warning that Rambo's Hall would
attempt a third triumph only granted significant rainfall and branded
those who had backed the gelding as ''barmy.''
However, he was more upbeat yesterday, reporting: ''Rambo's Hall is
fine. There has been some rain but there is a lot more forecast, and the
more the better.''

THE annual conference of the Law Society of England and Wales takes
place at the Birmingham International Convention Centre on October 6 and
7 and once again it is being sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The sponsorship -- to the tune of #65,000 -- means the cost of admission
drops from #199 to #160.
The organisers have this year received more than 1800 inquiries,
according to event manager Pru Ross. Its appeal has undoubtedly
increased because of the Royal Bank's involvement. The support is the
largest single sponsorship the Law Society has ever received and has
been provided by the bank as part of its drive to emphasise its leading
role in serving legal practioners throughout Britain.
One of the UK's largest providers of services to the legal profession,
the Royal Bank says it recognises that solicitors face the same
financial demands as any other business and today they are confronting
tougher challenges than ever because of deregulation and the growth of
competition within the profession.
This year's keynote speech will be made by Martin Mears, the first
democratically elected president of the Law Society for 41 years.
The Royal Bank has extensive sponsorship connections throughout the
UK. And the Law Society of Scotland has a long-standing relationship
with seminars, client care manuals and a bursary scheme for young
solicitors, all sponsored by the Royal Bank.

BELLAHOUSTON Sports Centre has been a friend to fitness and sport
enthusiasts in Glasgow for almost thirty years now, but even the oldest
of acquaintances will be delighted at the transformation of the centre
when it reopens its doors to the public this weekend.
After a year of refurbishment, facilities have been greatly expanded
to include the type of sports equipment and leisure amenities that will
take Glaswegians fighting fit into the twenty-first century.
The centre, which is owned by Glasgow City Council's Parks and
Recreation Department, is situated in the picturesque surroundings of
Bellahouston Park, just a few minutes drive from junction 24 of the M8.
The range of classes and activities follows the department's Sport for
Life for You strategy, which hopes to encourage certain sections of the
community to take advantage of the many fitness resources provided by
the parks and recreation department. A centre like Bellahouston is also
affordable to all, with added concessions for those on low incomes.
Among the new facilities made available by the #700,000 refurbishment
is a fitness studio. This has been purpose built to withstand the
pounding of over 30 classes a week. The mirrored room, which has a
sprung floor, air conditioning and a hi-tech sound system, will host
everything from aerobics to tone and stretch to box'r'cise and circuit
training.
Each class is graded by levels with absolute beginners in the same
classes as their counterparts -- no fear of being left behind -- and
gradually working through the levels as their fitness improves.
Bellahouston also boasts a new fitness suite which has been kitted out
with over 30 pieces of hi-tech Nautilus equipment, chosen not only for
its excellent reputation but because it's easy to use as a more
controlled way to tone up and improve your overall fitness level.
Although the suite can be used quite freely, the centre does insist
that first-time visitors book an induction programme where trained
instructors will demonstrate how to use the stations safely and for the
best possible benefit.
They will also draw up a programme, depending on what each person is
looking for from the equipment, and this is updated as fitness levels
improve over the months. This part of the centre is restricted to those
over 14 years old.
The centre can now also offer the perfect way to relax after a workout
or fitness class. The new health suite offers the luxury of a sauna,
steam room and sunbeds and there's also the chance to watch some
television and cool down with a refreshment in the lounge. There are
mixed and women-only sessions in the health suite -- here there's a
minimum age of 16.
Another new idea at Bellahouston is Bella-play, soft play sessions for
children. This soft play area includes colourful ball pools, slides,
ramps and other play equipment -- all on soft surfaces, meaning that
children can use up excess energy in a safe and stimulating environment.
The sessions are divided between those which are supervised, where
parents can go off and enjoy the centre's facilities, and unsupervised
where parents are required to stay in the area at all times. Certain
sessions are open to under fives, the rest to under eights. There is a
fun session on Saturday afternoons, however, where five to 12-year-olds
can enjoy the multi-activity studio for just 60p.
The prices put the activities within everyone's reach. A particularly
good example is the women's evening every Tuesday.
For just #3.40, women have full use of the facility for four hours
when they can choose to use the fitness suite, join in a class, use the
health suite and use the remainder of the evening to simply relax in the
lounge. There are supervised soft play sessions for children which run
in conjuction with the women only sessions -- these at just #1.20 per
child per session.
The women's jogging network, which is split into beginners and more
experienced joggers, takes advantage of the park surroundings -- and the
centre's 400 running track. The beginners' session can be booked in an
eight-week block.
There are also special sessions for people with disabilities, which
consist of a wide range of sports including short tennis, boccia and
table tennis. These are held in the main sports hall which is the size
of ten badminton courts.
Hockey, netball, badminton, basketball and volleyball are among the
team sports on offer. The council, as part of their sports strategy,
have also appointed development officers for certain sports, so with
regular coaching and excellent facilities, these centres may be
providing our national teams with the stars of the future. The sports
hall is also available for booking on a casual basis.
For the even more energetic, two squash courts are available for
booking throughout the week, and if anyone needs a partner, sessions on
Thursday and Sunday evenings will find a worthy competitor.
Not all fitness has to be fast and furious, however, especially for
the over-50 age group. Classes tailored to a more relaxed way of staying
supple such as slow jive and dance sessions are available, as is Tai Chi
which is said to relax both the mind and body.
Children's sessions begin at just 60p, adults at under #2. It's a pay
as you play centre, but for just #2 anyone can become a registered
customer which allows the booking of activities by telephone up to seven
days in advance -- particularly useful for peak times and popular
classes. Those on a low income may also qualify for a Passport to
Recreation. For #1, there are discounts of around 50% for off-peak
periods.
The activity starts in earnest at 9am this Saturday, but there's the
chance of a sneak preview on Friday evening from 5pm to 9pm, when anyone
interested can go along for a look round.

THE small business sector continues to be one of the fastest-growth
areas in the UK economy. Yet in Scotland, the deeply-entrenched belief
that it's better to work for someone else than for yourself prevails,
and Scots are still lagging behind the rest of the country when it comes
to starting up their own businesses.
Scottish Enterprise, aiming to boost the business birthrate north of
the Border, is in the middle of a major campaign driven by its boss
Crawford Beveridge. If the industrial and commercial base of Scotland
plc is to grow, it needs a strong and vibrant small business sector.
Every large company we have was once just a glint in somebody's eye!
A job for life has, for most of us, gone for good. Our own careers and
those of our children will increasingly involve radical changes in
direction, and that might well involve more of us starting our own
businesses.
Today, John Downie (left) of the Federation of Small Businesses checks
out three books which are currently vying for the hearts and minds of
those about to take the plunge.
RUNNING your own business, however small, can be an immensely
satisfying and stimulating experience. Given my position, you'd expect
me to say that, wouldn't you?
The truth is, every year thousands of Scots consider taking that
critical first step into the unknown. Faced with such a momentous
decision, many opt for the help of a start-your-own-business book.
But which one? Should it be the simple guide? The exhaustive
reference? The choice is endless. It appears that in the current
publishing war, business books seem to be one area that is resisting the
collapse of the Net Book Agreement. Certainly, a whole range of start-up
guides appear in an ever-ending flow.
Unfortunately, only a few are ever read from cover to cover by someone
running their own business. Personally, I know a good many business
people who barely have time to read their daily Herald! So for them, it
is a significant decision!
Are such books worth anyone's hard-earned cash? Just as important,
some valuable reading time? And how do these books stand up against the
free guide published by Scottish Enterprise? Which one will provide our
would-be retailers, manufacturers, publicans and self-employed
consultants with the answers to chart the way through the start-up
minefield?
The key, one successful young entrepreneur told a recent conference,
is simplicity. ''In the early stages, starting your own business can be
like playing football blindfolded. You may know you're on a playing
field, but is it level? And where are the goalposts? No matter how smart
you think you are, what you really need is a step-by-step idiot's guide
to keep you out of trouble.''
With this criterion in mind, I examined two recent bestsellers.
Judging the first candidate in the battle for readers proved to be
simple. The Complete Guide* might be No 2 in the charts, but it came a
cropper at the first hurdle. As a source of information for a would-be
entrepreneur it would scare half of them to death.
There's undoubtedly truth in its claim to be an ''exhaustive reference
source'' but as a user-friendly guide for the potential entrepreneur, I
am afraid it doesn't work. It delivers information overkill in a format
which is far from user-friendly.
In marked contrast The Small Business Bible* is, as befits a book
written by a business journalist, a much more accessible guide. It reads
like a book you would buy for pleasure, although I think ''bible'' is
going a bit strong. The condensed Reader's Digest version is more like
it.
It deals with the basic questions any budding tycoon wants answered.
''Can I really run my own business? . . . What business should I be in
anyway? . . . Where can I raise the start-up finance?'' and ''What
support is there for new businesses?''
As a buy-me-and-use-me business book it gets my vote . . . but wait
just a minute. How does it stand up against the free guide from Scottish
Enterprise?
A Guide to Business in Scotland* provides a concise and elementary
outline of all the areas you should consider before starting your own
business. And while, like its conpetitors, it answers all the main
start-up questions, it makes absolutely no claims to be a comprehensive
guide.
This is an important, but often ignored, point. No start-up guide can
or should even attempt to cover everything, given the sheer variety of
new business possibilities. Knowledge is the key but only in the proper
context.
The Guide is a simple testament to this fact. A businesswoman said to
me recently: ''At the start I had a million questions churning around in
my brain. Raising extra finance, creating my business plan, paying
taxes, sole trader or limited company? The Guide put everything into
perspective. Each chapter is set out in a simple and logical sequence
and most importantly the book includes a section on where to go for more
detailed help and information.''
The Guide then is, in my view, an excellent read -- a no-nonsense
guide to business success and a great starting point for anyone who's
planning to take the plunge.

RODIME has suffered a major setback in its legal battle to protect its
patent rights for computer disk drives in the United States, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
The Scottish company said a federal appeals court in Washington had
upheld the decision of a Minnesota district court which ruled that
certain claims of Rodime's US patent 383 were invalid.
Rodime said this setback in its suit against the US computer firm
Quantum would adversely affect its ability to enforce licencing
agreements with other manufacturers ''thereby significantly reducing the
potential royalties available to the company.''
Rodime's battered shares lost more than half their remaining value
after the announcement, falling 2[1/2]p to 2p.
Director David Mathewson said Rodime was now considering whether or
not to carry its appeal against the Quantum ruling to the US supreme
court.
But he said the company would continue pressing for a separate suit
against the US firm Seagate to be brought to trial in California.
Mr Mathewson said part of the Quantum ruling had an impact on the
Seagate case, but there were other issues which were unaffected by it.
''The strategy is to bring Seagate to trial as soon as possible,'' he
said.
Rodime was a leading developer of computer disk drives in the 1980's,
but pulled out of manufacturing to rely on income from licencing others
to make the hardware.
The company has received virtually no revenue since it signed its last
licencing agreement in 1993, but it has shelled out millions of dollars
over the last three years to fight its legal battles against Quantum and
Seagate.
The precedents set by these two cases will determine Rodime's ability
to obtain royalties from other disk drive manufacturers.
Rodime suffered a $2m loss during the six months to March 31.

AYRSHIRE-based fertiliser company Scotphos has been acquired by the
publicly-quoted Carr's Milling Industries, based in Carlisle, for #1.2m,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
Executive chairman Gordon Howe, who owns the majority of Scotphos, and
his deputy, Peter Scott, will between them receive #670,000 worth of
Carr's shares, with the balance paid in cash on December 31.
Mr Howe will remain a director of Scotphos and will also play a role
within Carr's agricultural division. Mr Scott will take over as managing
director.
Scotphos, the subject of a management buy-out from Scottish
Agricultural Industries about five years ago, manufactures forestry and
agricultural fertiliser at Newton-on-Ayr for distribution throughout
Scotland and the Borders area of England.
Carr's, with interests spanning agriculture, food and engineering,
will increase the West Coast coverage of its fertiliser business with
the acquisition of Scotphos.
It already produces fertiliser at Runcorn, Cheshire, and at Silloth,
Cumbria.
In the year to end-December, Scotphos made pre-tax profits of #9000 on
turnover of #3.9m. However, it has warranted that pre-tax profits for
the nine months to end-September will be at least #300,000 and that net
asset value will be not less than #700,000 at September 30.
Although production is likely to be increased at Newton-on-Ayr as a
result of the takeover, no increase is anticipated in the 11-strong
workforce.
Carr's chief executive Chris Holmes said: ''The expansion into
Scotland should allow Carr's Milling to distribute other products
through Scotphos, as well as giving Carr's similar opportunities to
market the Scotphos specialist product range.''

INTERNATIONAL marketing group Inchcape, which is the world's largest
independent car distributor, yesterday spelt out the adverse impact of a
soaring yen on demand for Toyota cars and the consumer spending downturn
in some of its markets.
The company has suffered for around 18 months and has issued several
profit warnings. It is now taking a large exceptional charge of #64.7m
for cost cutting, mainly redundancies, and structural actions which has
contributed to an 85% slump half-year pre-tax profits.
At the operating level ahead of exceptionals, profits are 34% lower at
#83.3m on turnover just 3% ahead. The interim dividend is maintained but
paid as a Foreign Income Dividend.
The shares eased 12p to 356p.
Inchcape, which announced a worldwide 2000 redundancy programme in
May, has already cut 1520 jobs, mostly concentrated in the motor and
marketing divisions, and is also lining up further cutting measures and
disposals including its London head office.
Commenting on group action, group chief executive and deputy chairman
Charles Mackay said: ''What this shows is that we won't shrink from
taking aggressive action even if it hurts us in the short term.''
The net effect of all the exceptionals charged against the half year
will be a cash inflow of more than #40m and a reduction to the cost base
of around #30m in 1996 and about #40m per annum thereafter.
Disposals planned for the second half are expected to give rise to an
exceptional loss of up to #50m, including write-off of historical
goodwill, but they will also generate more than #20m cash and will have
small positive effect on future profits.
Most of Inchcape's Japanese franchises suffered further from lack of
price competitiveness amid weak market conditions, particularly in
France and in Hong Kong, where a 25% fall in the latter market hit all
the franchises.
However, the non-Japanese import operations, such as Jaguar and Audi
in Australia and Chrysler and Ferrari in the UK, generally continued to
perform well as did stand-alone retailing in the UK.
In marketing, profits were slightly down on the previous year with
both Hong Kong and Singapore suffering from downturns in consumer
spending. Against this, though, Japan continued to improve, driven by
increased consumer product sales and the upturn in the brewery equipment
industry, while the performance of Coca Cola in Chile is described as
''outstanding''.
In addition to its overall review of activitutes and attendant cost
reductions, Inchcape has been negotiating with its principals for
improved terms of trade and support in difficult markets and expects to
increasingly benefit over the next two years from these and the launch
of new products. Working capital control and asset utilisation also
remain a high priority and the company says it is beginning to see an
improvement.
Chairman Sir David Plastow says that when consumer demand for vehicles
and other products in Inchcape's key markets recovers, and the Japanese
vehicle manufacturers regain price competitiveness across their product
range, profits will benefit accordingly.
A sustained weakening of the yen will help this process, but it should
be noted, says the chairman, that so far the yen has only returned to
the level of the end of last year.
Inchcape's international insurance broking operation Bain Hogg, whose
Scottish operation is one of the most rapidly expanding in the country,
has achieved a 32% increase in operating profit to #25.3m.

FOREIGN exchange markets were a good deal quieter yesterday after
Friday's turmoil when the dollar plunged below 100 yen and the mark made
headway amid speculation about the diminishing chances of European
monetary union materialising on schedule.
The weekend summit in Majorca did nothing to restore confidence.
Nevertheless the mark was taking a breather after recent gains, and the
dollar at one point reclaimed 100 yen territory before remarks by
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer questioned the effectiveness of
central bank support operations, from which the dollar has benefited.
The pound, very much the pig in the middle of the currency tug-of-war
between the dollar on the one hand and the mark and the yen on the
other, dropped 0.85 cents to $1.5713 but rose 1.50 pfennigs to DM2.2481.
Sterling looked wobbly as its trade-weighted index edged down from 84.5
to 84.4.
At this level it has lost 4.6% of its value since the start of the
year. At one point yesterday the index was down at 84.2. Back in May
just after Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke first rebuffed
Bank of England Governor Eddie George over interest rates the pound
dropped to 82.7 when it hit a low of DM2.1795.
A weak currency is a sure fire way of importing inflation. Whether
sterling plumbs May's depths again depends largely on the fortunes of
the dollar and whether any tax cuts in the Budget are perceived to be
fiscally responsible.
The dollar had a good run over the summer, but was out of favour last
week after profit-taking set in. Sentiment was also upset by concern
over the US trade gap and disappointment over Japan's economic package
which is designed to bring its longest post-war recession to an end.
Currency markets are notoriously difficult to second guess, but one
persistent fear is that the dollar is in terminal decline against the
hard currencies because of the size of its fiscal and trade deficits.
Its relative strength against the Mexican peso and the Canadian
dollar, in which it conducts increasing proportions of its trade, is
another limitation on its chances of staging a full recovery.
Against such a background Clarke cannot afford to take risks with
fiscal policy as he plans his Budget strategy.
Long road
INCHCAPE'S problems have been well aired and the half-year
performance, albeit below some projections and consequently hitting the
share price, was not totally unexpected by the markets.
The company is clearly now making all the right moves against a still
extremely tough background. Its non-motor activities continue for the
most part to hold up well. And chief executive Charles Mackay makes no
bones about taking whatever action he deems necessary to put the group
back on a sound footing after the disappointments of the past year or
two.
Action already being taken will generate more than #40m cash, and
improve the cost base by some #30m next year rising to #40m thereafter.
The company has also been reducing its reliance on Japanese car makers
with non-Japanese franchises rising in recent years. Inchcape is also
renegotiating its contracts with manufacturers. In short it is doing
everthing it can to clear the decks.
That said, the chairman's warning that the yen has only returned to
the level of the end of last year, and the recent turmoil in currency
markets, means that Inchcape is by no means out of the wood yet.
A sustained weakening of the yen would be more than helpful but there
can be no guarantees on this score. Moreover demand remains week with
core markets depressed. Toyota's concentration on the luxury end of the
market did not help sales in Europe and while the Japanese car
manufacturer is now catering for a broader spectrum, this will take time
to work through.
In short, while Inchcape is taking out costs, as yet there is no
overall progress in underlying market conditions and this seems bound to
continue to act as a constraint on the share price.
T&amp;N burden
ENGINEER T&amp;N still carries the burden of its past like the proverbial
albatross and that continues to affect market sentiment towards what is
undoubtedly one of the major success stories in British manufacturing
industry.
One one hand there is a company which is rapidly gaining ever greater
share of the European motor components market as it is in the US thanks
to its heavy and persistent investment in research and development.
However, the dark cloud remains the long running asbestosis
compensation claims where the financial impact has ebbed and flowed over
the years but is currently threatening a spring tide.
Next month a $185m case starts brought by Chase Manhattan bank for
compensation because asbestosis was incorporated into its headquarters
building.
Ominously, perhaps, the case is a before jury in New York state --
until now T&amp;N has been remarkably successful in its defences although
under different state jurisdictions.
T&amp;N has said that it has subsantial legal cover and yesterday added to
its financial war chest with the #52m sale of its BIP plastics business
as not being a core actvty any longer. So in the last few months,
chairman Colin Hope has accumulated #100m against a rainy day --
although the half-time results last month incorporated additional
asbestosis provisions.
The figures also included additional carrying costs against the
options to buy a majority stake in the Kolbenschmidt piston manufacturer
in Germany which has been rejected several times by the regulatory
authorities on cartel grounds. That is again being appealed although it
will not be for several months before a final decision is reached.
T&amp;N's acquisitions so far in Germany have been remarkably successful
and have the advantage of combining the technologies of both that
country and the UK where it has one of the best records for research and
development even during the worst of the automobile recessions.
The Chase case will not be finished until February. Success for T&amp;N
would coincide with the expected recoveries from weakness in both its
major car markets. At 182p, the shares are anticipating a reasonably
sanguine outcome.

With only one Scots school having opted out in five years, the
Government has renewed efforts to lead parents towards self-government.
STUART MILLAR reports.
EVEN by Tory standards it is a bizarre strategy. On both sides of the
border the Government has defied all logic and embarked once again on a
crusade to persuade schools to opt out of local authority control.
In Scotland the policy is particularly strange. More than five years
down the line only one school, Dornoch Academy in Grampian, has chosen
self-governing status. Little wonder that the latest noises from St
Andrews House have been greeted with a combination of apathy and
complete bewilderment.
Despite the protestations of Scottish Education Minister Raymond
Robertson, who claims to be ''An unashamed fan of self-governing
schools'', parents and education professionals remain united in their
opposition to opting out.
John Mitchell, of the Headteachers' Association of Scotland, sums up
the dominant attitude: ''Heads down south talk about money all the time,
heads up here talk about education, teaching and learning.'' In Scotland
opting out is seen as an English phenomenon.
But is it? Certainly at the outset at least, self-governing status
seemed to take off. And a glance at the statistics backs up the notion
that opting out has been a success in England. According to the Grant
Maintained Schools Foundation, the Government-funded body charged with
promoting and advising on GM status, 75% of local education authorities
in England contain schools which are either already grant maintained or
have been approved for GM status. A quarter of LEAs have 25% or more of
secondary pupils in GM schools.
However, closer analysis paints a different picture. The number of
schools voting to opt out had dropped by 70% in each of the last two
years. From a post-election high of 555 in 1992/93, just 50 have opted
out in the last year. Now only 1081 schools in England and 16 in Wales
have GM status.
Clearly the Government is falling well short of meeting its target of
3900 GM secondary schools it set in the Choice and Diversity White Paper
let alone the ''significant proportion of the 19,000 primary schools''
target. South of the border, opting out is almost as big a washout as in
Scotland.
Yet the Government -- or number 10 in the Scottish Office if not the
Department for Education -- remain devotees of opting out. Raymond
Robertson admits opting out has not been a big hit with parents, but
that is only because they are being fed black propaganda and
misinformation by educational Luddites in the guise of parents groups,
teaching unions and opposition parties. If only parents really
understood the benefits, we are told, they would be queuing up for
self-governing status.
A similar argument has been run in England and Wales. According to Sir
Robert Balchin, chairman of the Grant Maintained Schools Foundation, the
decline in opting out stems from ''a wave of hostility against every
opt-out attempt'' on the part of opposition-controlled LEAs. As a
result, parental ballots have become ''seriously politicised'' and fewer
heads and governors have been willing to push too hard for GM status.
The expansion of Local Management of Schools -- the English equivalent
of Devolved Management -- under which at least 90% of budget
responsibility for schools is delegated to the governing body, has been
the focus of opposition deception, Sir Robert claimed.
''In some areas schools and parents have been misled into believing
that the advantages of GM have diminished,'' he said. ''Nothing could be
further from the truth.''
Mr Robertson's solution, and so far the only concrete proposal for
boosting opting out in Scotland, is the establishment of ''one stop
advice shops'' for parents and school boards. The Grant Maintained
Schools Foundation is a useful indicator of what Scotland can expect
from these one-stop shops.
It receives over #700,000 a year from the Department of Education to,
as Sir Robert put it, ''give parents the truth about what the advantages
are of becoming grant maintained and to remind them of the
difficulties.''
However, despite the amount of resources put into promoting GM by the
Foundation -- at one point it was criticised for having more staff than
schools had opted out in that month -- the fact remains that opt-outs
have slowed to a trickle. Raymond Robertson take note: one stop advice
shops may sound good but they will not cause a flood in opt-out
applications.
''We have found that the more parents know about it the less likely
they are to go for it,'' said Martin Rogers of Local Schools
Information, an organisation opposed to opting out which is funded by
almost every education authority in England and Wales.
''Governors and parents have been on the receiving end of a
bombardment of propaganda. It beggers belief that John Major can't see
the writing on the wall even when it's written in such large and bright
letters.''
Judging by this month's speech to GM school heads in Newcastle, the
Prime Minister has apparently recognised that it will take more than
information to convince parents to opt out.
While stopping short of announcing legislation making all schools
grant maintained, he outlined proposals which can solve the thorny
problem of sceptical parents by removing them from the equation
altogether. Under a new ''fast track'' route, church schools currently
run by LEAs and governing bodies including church trustees will be
allowed to opt out simply by a vote of the governors and without
consulting parents. Only 131 of the 4860 church schools have opted out
so far.
After the speech, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard said abolishing
ballots was only one proposal for consultation. But the removal of the
parental voice from a policy supposedly based on parental choice could
extend to all schools, according to Sir Robert Balchin.
''Parental choice is very limited,'' he said. ''It is poised between
two ideologies. I would support the ballot going on if Labour and the
Liberals pledge to keep their people from engaging in bitter campaigns
of hostile misinformation. But that is not going to happen.''
Martin Rogers believes that the Prime Minister's speech will not
increase opting out and will in fact return to haunt him before the
election. ''I can see a scenario where John Major over the next 12
months becomes as embarrassed by education policy as he has accused Tony
Blair of being in the last 12 months,'' he said.
At the moment Raymond Robertson is ruling out any form of compulsion
in Scotland. But as the English experience shows, when information alone
does not work more extreme measures will be considered.

THERE is still a living to be made in the building and construction
sector if one knows where to look and at present Amey is hoping to pick
up quite chunky contracts in Scotland.
It is bidding for three with the largest being the upgrading of the
A74 to motorway standard and worth perhaps #100m with the Scottish
Office decision expected before the year end. That should coincide to
within a week or two with the awards of the Clyde and Tay five-year road
maintenance contracts which should be worth somewhat over #50m each and
where Amey is in competition with three or four other construction
groups.
Already under its belt is the joint venture design and build #25m
contract with Miller for the A1 between Haddington and Tranent in East
Lothian.
The overall order book has received an additional #158m of new work to
increase the total outstanding to #288m.
In the half-year to June, pre-tax profits were effectively unchanged
at #1.74m on turnover 17% better at #114m. But that is somewhat more
historic than usual as Amey has now pushed decisively into facilities
management -- the biggest deal being the #80m contract to manage
services in Portsmouth over five years from street cleaning to housing
and also involvng the transfer of 1000 employees.
Chairman Neil Ashley is optimistic that the Private Finance Initiative
will soon result in much more work, particularly in road building -- in
contrast to Taylor Woodrow's Colin Parsons who said last week that the
PFI was ''constipated''.
Amey which was floated last year at 161p has a small housebuilding
business with a sales target of about 150 units. Somewhat unusually, it
buys land with planning permission rather than accumulating a land bank
but so far has found it hard going with only breakeven at present.
The interim dividend has been raised 60% to 2.4p.
Full-year profits seem likely to improve from #5.2m to #6.4m which
would leave the shares now at 137p trading a 9[1/2] times possible
earnings accompanied by a 5.8% yield on the basis of a full year payout
of 6.4p. This looks like one of the better bets in the sector.

JOHN Menzies has bought Concorde Express Transport, a freight handling
company at Heathrow airport, for #9.6m, as part of its plans to become a
major player in the air cargo sector, writes ROBERT POWELL.
John Menzies already owns AMI, a company which consolidates air
freight shipments at Heathrow and Gatwick on behalf of courier and
forwarding companies.
Group managing director Ranald Noel-Paton said there was plenty of
scope for synergy between AMI and Concorde, but they would continue
operating as separate businesses.
Further acquisitions in the air freight handling sector are planned.
''We will be looking at the opportunities that present themselves,'' Mr
Noel-Paton said.
Concorde is the only independent company that loads and unloads
freight at Heathrow which is not owned by a major airline. It made a
pre-tax profit of #1.1m during the year to June 30.
Concorde's clients include Virgin Atlantic Airways, the US carrier
Braniff and the Brazilian national airline Varig.
Mr Noel-Paton said the air freight handling business was a new area
where John Menzies planned to apply its expertise in distribution, built
up in its core business as a news agent, stationer and bookseller.
''It is a transmission of our traditional skills into a new market
which offers us strong growth over the long term and steady year-round
business which is not subject to seasonal fluctuations,'' he said.
Mr Noel-Paton said John Menzies would concentrate on building up its
air freight handling business at Heathrow airport, which handles 80% of
all UK air cargo by value.
But he said the Edinburgh-based group might also buy freight handling
companies operating at other airports if the opportunity arose.
John Menzies will pay for Concorde with three-year loan notes. Its
shares closed unchanged at 610p.

HODDER Headline warned yesterday that profits would fall this year
amid ''exceptionally difficult'' conditions for consumer books.
The depressed market and an increased interest charge were expected to
reduce profits below the #8.2m pre-tax figure achieved in 1994, it said.
Hodder gave the warning as it unveiled half-year taxable profits of
#2.1m, compared with #2m for the first half of last year.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 2p on earnings per share
increased to 4.2p from 3.8p.
''The UK consumer book market has become exceptionally difficult
during this year.
''These results are respectable in the circumstances, but I am very
cautious about the prospects for 1995,'' said chief executive Tim Hely
Hutchinson.
''Library budgets for book purchases have fallen sharply and there
have been widely reported problems at some of our retail customers,'' he
added.

THE Scottish investment community is losing, at least for the moment,
one of its most outstanding figures after Graeme Knox said that he is
resigning from both Scottish Amicable Investment Management as managing
director and also from the board of the life company.
Mr Knox's announcement came as a thunderbolt in its timing although
there has been speculation as to what he would do eventually.
In a formal statement, he said that it has never been his intention to
retire gracefully at 60, he is now 50, but rather to leave when he could
see that his long term aspirations for SAIM as a company were coming to
fruition.
Later he added that that it had not been possible to find a role for
him in the company.
It is thought that he will receive compensation.
Mr Knox, who always seems to have a twinkle in the eye, is being
succeeded by two fellow SAIM directors.
Douglas Ferrans becomes chief executive officer -- he currently heads
up the UK equities side while international equities chief Stewart
Gilchrist becomes chief investment officer.
SAIM was set up earlier this year to give the fund management side
greater autonomy although employees will be given a minority
shareholding.
It is believed that one reason for its formation was that it would
dissuade certain directors leaving ScotAm for higher salaries elsewhere.
Bernard Solomons who chairs SAIM as well as Allied Provincial
Securities said that Mr Knox is going out at the peak of his powers.
Mr Knox is probably best known as being a contrarian thinker and
always prepared to speak his mind. That reached perhaps its greatest
prominence when he spoke out against the Guinness bid for Distillers.
At a shareholders' meeting in September 1986 in the Churchill Hotel in
London, he virtually alone spoke out against the rubber stamping of
Ernest Saunders as chairman and chief executive and the dumping of then
Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Thomas Risk as chairman of the enlarged
drinks group. One Robert Maxwell, now deceased, uttered a paean of
praise to Mr Saunders.
Mr Knox said that he had been in the firing line for 20 years,
fighting with the quarterly performance tables. But now it was time to
move on.
He has a few irons in the fire and it seems certain that some will be
in the investment field although not in full time employment.
''Investment is in your veins as chief investment officer.''
He has held that position since 1975.
Over the years Scottsh Amicable had built up a reputation as one of
the most successful mutual life offices in the investment field.
Under his leadership, ScotAm built up investment funds of #12bn but
during the recession suffered more than most from the downturn in
markets. That reflected the decision to concentrate on small companies
for which Mr Knox was heavily critiised although he claimed yesterday
that the last three years had been very good on the investment side.
He added that building up SAIM has meant that ScotAm has been very
brave in accepting that it has an independent investment company rather
than an in-house team. It has to accept that if it is to compete, it has
got to be with a group of people who have proved themselves with
external clients. The culture is different from the service culture of
the life office.
* MEANWHILE, a spokesman for ScotAm denied speculation that there were
any merger discussions taking place with a building society at present.

MANWEB yesterday continued its week-long talks with a potential white
knight -- widely believed to the US power company Pacificorp -- to save
it from the clutches of a hostile bid by ScottishPower.
Pacificorp, which is based in Portland, Oregon, said it was looking
for possible acquisitions in the UK, Australia and India, but declined
to say whether it had Manweb in its sights.
''It's a policy of our company not to comment on any merger or
acquisition that may be under way,'' said company spokesman David
Kvamme.
''We remain interested in the globalisation of the electricity
industry and are interested in the UK, India and Australia,'' he added.
Pacificorp has 1.3 million customers in seven states in the north-west
of the US and total assets of $11.8bn.
Speculation that the mystery overseas suitor may outbid
ScottishPower's #1100m hostile bid for Manweb kept Manweb shares
relatively stable on a day when publicity surrounding Labour's plans for
a windfall profits tax on privatised utilities drove electricity
companies up to 25p lower.
Manweb shares eased 2p to 1004p while ScottishPower fell 5[1/2]p to
352[1/2]p.
This left ScottishPower's main cash-plus-shares offer for Manweb worth
only 1005p, little more than its all-cash alternative of 990p.
City analysts said any recommended offer for Manweb would have to come
in at around 1080p -- the price at which Manweb has implicitly valued
itself at.
Opinions differ as to whether ScottishPower might be prepared to top
that in a bidding war, but Kevin Lapwood, an electricity analyst with
Smith New Court in London, thought it might.
He said that valuing Manweb at 1080p involved taking a ''very very
pessimistic view'' of the company's rump value once its promised
benefits package for loyal shareholders worth 550p share had been
factored out.
Manweb declined to confirm a rash of weekend reports that its mystery
suitor was Pacificorp, but the Chester-based company repeated its
week-old mantra: ''Substantive talks are continuing with an overseas
third party which may or may not lead to a recommended cash offer.''
Chief executive John Roberts stressed that Manweb still wanted to
remain independent and the company's takeover should not be regarded as
a foregone conclusion.
''Manweb has an excellent future as an independent company,'' he said.
Weekend reports that Manweb's mystery suitor was Pacificorp gained
credence in the City yesterday. Mr Lapwood at Smith New Court said
Manweb had been collaborating with the US firm for the last six years.
A Manweb spokeswoman agreed that Manweb had exchanged information with
Pacificorp about consumer service and information technology, but added
that Manweb had conducted similar exercises with 20 US power companies.
''There is nothing significant in the fact that they were one of
them,'' she said.
City analysts said the Labour Party's pledge to impose a windfall
profits tax on privatised utilities was unlikely to put off a foreign
bidder, since this proposal had been party policy for the last three
years.
Most also dismissed suggestions that the present Government might
impose such a tax, noting that such a move would undermine
privatisations that are still pending such as the National Grid and
British Rail.
''I think it is just too much of a U-turn for the Conservative Party
to undergo,'' said one London-based electricity analyst.

* SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric yesterday accepted revised price controls
proposed by the industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild.
The Perth-based power company rejected Professor Littlechild's initial
proposals last year, saying they would not give it enough revenue in
electricity distribution to renew ageing power lines that supply remote
communities in the Highlands and Islands.
The issue was then referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
whose findings were published in June and broadly accepted by both
sides.
''Scottish Hydro-Electric has reviewed the new price controls proposed
. . . As they adopt the MMC's recommendation, the company is pleased to
accept them,'' the company said.
Hydro-Electric said its developent plans would continue to focus on
expanding business south of the Border and pledged to deliver dividend
growth of 6% a year in the medium term.

THE Serious Fraud Office said yesterday it was investigating ''alleged
irregularities'' referred to it by TSB Group.
An SFO spokesman said the inquiry centred on a former employee of the
TSB merchant bank subsidiary, Hill Samuel.
The SFO spokesman said: ''Matters referred to us from the TSB are
being investigated. The investigation is into alleged irregularities
involving a former employee of the Hill Samuel bank.''
Inquiries had begun in the spring, he added.
He refused to comment on a claim in a newspaper report yesterdaythat
the investigation could involve questioning senior TSB directors,
possibly including the group's head, Sir Nicholas Goodison.
The TSB said: ''There is no SFO investigation into the TSB Group or
involving current directors of the group or of Hill Samuel.
''The SFO is investigating a former employee who left the group in
1992. The amount of money involved in the allegations associated with
this investigation is not significant in group terms.''
A TSB spokesman said he could not confirm that the investigation
involved a former Hill Samuel director.
The SFO had been involved since ''around the time'' of the TSB's
annual meeting in Glasgow in March, when Sir Nicholas told shareholders
there was a possibility of fraud.
Following up allegations by London businessman Michael Gross, TSB
spent #675,000 last year on investigations headed by leading London law
firm Linklaters &amp; Paine.
At the annual meeting, Sir Nicholas said a similar sum was likely to
be spent in the current year.
He attributed the substantial cost of the investigation to its very
wide nature and the fact that many of Mr Gross's allegations went back
many years.
TSB reported a #150m loss in the first half of 1991, after provisions
for #440m ''bad debt'' at Hill Samuel, which it took over in 1987.

WRITER Alan Warner, whose novel Morvern Callar was published earlier
this year to critical acclaim, shrugs: ''I never go to the theatre.''
Why then is he collaborating with theatre company Boilerhouse to produce
No New Miracles, a devised work inspired by the nineteenth-century
German playwright Georg Buchner's novella Lenz? And why is that company
so drawn to working with writers, from Barry Graham to Irvine Welsh,
whose interest in, and commitment to, drama can seem little more than
debutant dabbling?
Paul Pinson, artistic director of Boilerhouse, is aware of a cynical
perception of the company as one that cashed in on the notoriety of
young local writers, but rejects it absolutely. He points out that
Boilerhouse is interested in vital collaborations with any individual
who can offer a fresh perspective to its work, which is firmly located
in devised processes as opposed to straightforward scripts or
adaptations.
Indeed, Warner's involvement had been instigated on the recommendation
of playwright and poet Duncan McLean -- who worked with Boilerhouse on
Julie Allardyce two years ago -- before Morvern Callar even hit the
bookshops.
After having worked on last year's Headstate, devised by Irvine Welsh,
Pinson had wanted to try something completely different; ''Something
that wasn't hard edged, with lots of swearing, set in a Glasgow
tenement.''
A letter from Warner setting out his interest in creating something
that avoided ''ugly, predictable urban decay'' but looked elsewhere ''at
beauty, nature, and spirituality'' seemed promising, and an informal
meeting at Edinburgh's City Cafe was set up.
What clinched the project was a perceived shared sensibility. While
Pinson enthused about the work of environmental artist Andy Galsworthy
and explained his desire to create something similarly elemental on
stage, Warner slid a book on Galsworthy across the table. In turn,
Pinson produced Buchner's Lenz and asked Warner to read it and come back
at him with ideas.
Buchner's fictionalised account of the time the playwright Jacob Lenz
spent in a small village near Strasbourg, struggling with intimations of
insanity, duly captured Warner's imagination, offering a springboard for
a non-naturalistic piece that explores notions of spirituality -- but,
significantly for Warner, outwith a Christian framework.
His involvement with the work has been intense, attending daily
rehearsals and debating every nuance with the cast, choreographer Andy
Howitt, designer Kate Borthwick, and Pinson. After the success of Morven
Callar, Warner is now busy with more lucrative work -- including a
screenplay of Morvern for the BBC Screen Two Strand -- and admits he has
been a little overwhelmed by how time-intensive the Boilerhouse project
has been. ''It has gone on a lot longer than I imagined and is now
interfering with other deadlines; but you can't walk away from a piece
like this.''
Sitting in a quiet pub across the street from the rehearsal space at
Lockhart Memorial Hall in Edinburgh, Warner and Pinson discussed the
company's collective ideology. ''Looking back to when we started out, it
seems so long ago,'' reflects Warner. ''What we are working on now
compared to what I originally wrote is quite a transformation. I've had
to interact with everybody else's ideas. For me, it's been a different
way of working, but not that different in the sense that whatever you
are writing you always think you have an idea of how it will conclude.
But experience has taught me that it never turns out the way you
imagined.''
Pinson nods: ''The nature of collaborative work is challenging for
everybody; you have to be prepared to follow the flow and . . . '' --
with a quick glance at Warner -- '' . . . to throw things away.''
Warner smiles into his pint. ''To kill your children,'' he says
ruefully.
''And to foster new ones,'' says Pinson pointedly. ''Every group of
actors has different needs, different ideas, different hopes. There is
no formula for this kind of process.''
''You soon realise that no word on the page is final; things go on
changing, and that in itself is quite exciting, but there are some
problems.
''I'm not sure exactly to what degree it is a move to justice -- the
very fact that this interview is only taking place with the director and
writer is telling in itself,'' says Warner, indicating the rest of the
company chatting in the opposite corner of the pub, although this is a
division imposed by my interview request rather than one instigated by
the company, who do seem committed to egalitarian work practices.
''There is probably not a sufficient breaking down of the power
structures, but then I'm not sure if that is what is needed for creating
art. The buck does have to stop somewhere.''
Certainly Pinson who, during a Herald debate at the Tramway as part of
the current Dark Lights season, had discussed his reluctance to assume
the traditional decision-making role, concedes that in the final week of
rehearsals he has been flexing his directorial muscles more.
Whatever the problems, they are confident they have created an
inventive work that flies in the face of their disdain for conventional
naturalistic theatre. Warner elaborates on his seemingly dismissive
views of the stage to point out that he believes  ''theatre can be
wonderful, I just don't like theatre when it tries to be a movie. The
language of theatre can be more lyrical and subtle, and that's the
language that has to be explored.''

AS soon as the curtain lifted, Phillip Prowse's adaptation of Don
Carlos by Fredrich Von Schiller made an impression on the audience
rarely matched.
The imposing, slightly threatening overhang set a mood for a play
which was rarely light-hearted. Dimly-lit, the stage instantly evoked an
eerie atmosphere, enhanced by the use of blue in the lighting. Faces and
objects were shadowed and defined strongly, echoing the dark and
slightly menacing mood throughout.
From the start, we were thrust into a complex weave of plots,
intertwined so far that it was sometimes difficult to tell exactly what
was happening. Prowse did not let his audience off lightly, making the
most of his resources to both complicate and enhance the play.
Everything was symbolic. The stage was in shades of black and white
with a touch of gold, cleverly interpreting the play's themes of evil,
innocence and the monarchy. Costumes, too, had this effect, with the
characters dressed in the colour best fitting their moods. This medium
was actually used to double impact, with three different periods
intertwined in the costume design.
Although after a while I recognised that the outfits represented the
past (tradition), the present and the future (revolution), this
complication could have perhaps been too much for some of the audience
to handle, interspersed with the complex action on stage.
The acting was no letdown after the initial thrill of the set. The
Citizens' own Giles Havergal was magnificent as the lonely King, while
Sophie Ward made a beautiful, extremely regal Queen. In her restrained
scenes with Don Carlos, I am sure she captured the heart of most of the
audience as a woman torn between desire and duty, remaining innocent
through all the evil and corruption encompassing her.
In general, the acting sparkled although there were some parts which I
did not find convincing; in particular the first scene between Don
Carlos and the Marquis of Posa.
Although Andrew Woodhall was excellent elsewhere as the Marquis --
evoking true emotion in his scene with the King and I felt that his
friendship with Carlos seemed unduly false, somewhat overacted by both
men. Benedick Bates's Don Carlos appeared rather too fickle to be such a
true and worthy prince as the play suggests.
Nevertheless, this play was one which I am sure the audience will
remember for years to come. The 10-minute intervals between each of the
five scenes were certainly needed to ponder over the plot. It was easy
to become lost with any short break of concentration.
The historical element was portrayed well, while still making
concessions for a modern audience. Every possible stop was pulled out to
make this play a complete theatrical experience and one which I am sure
Schiller himself would be proud of. The real credit however should go to
Phillip Prowse who had the vision to take charge of both design and
direction in this superb work.

As details of Glasgay! arts festival are revealed, RUTH WISHART is
assured that there will be no reduction in the high standards
THIS morning, Cordelia Ditton, artistic director of Glasgay!, will
announce the programme details of Glasgow's second Lesbian and Gay Arts
Festival. The first, launched into the void of unpredictable reaction in
1993, proved a success beyond the hopes of its organisers. Their reward
for what was widely judged both a critically and commercially viable
innovation has been the attraction of increased budgets from initially
hesitant core funders.
The Scottish Arts Council is expected to chip in #18,800 (up from
#9000), Glasgow City Council has pledged #15,000 (from #7000), and
Strathclyde's #6500 (plus #1000 for workshops continuing from the last
festival) represents a 100 % mark-up. Each of these bodies, having read
the runes from '93, felt justified in doubling its commitment.
And it was apparently this injection of public money into the modest
overall budget of #98,000 that caused the ''Scottish'' Daily Mail, now
enjoying a tartan reincarnation, to suffer from first-degree apoplexy on
its front page yesterday morning. In a headline firmly in the tradition
of its parent paper it trumpeted: ''Taxpayer Funds Gays' Jamboree''.
Two items from the jamboree attracted particular censure; a
''pinknic'' and what the Mail characterised as a ''homosexual Hallowe'en
party'' in a park. Scarcely able to contain its indignation, the Mail
breathlessly advised its readers that children would be able to attend
both events.
Ms Ditton pronounced herself more bemused and bewildered than
especially bothered when she learned of her first, somewhat unexpected,
burst of pre-festival publicity. ''One of the things I think we did best
in '93 was to stage special events that would be fun. The Pinknic is
just that kind of fun event, staged indoors inside a marquee. It's the
kind of thing that is non-scary for people who are unsure of their
sexuality, and non-threatening to people outside the lesbian and gay
community. Who can be frightened by a picnic?
''As for the Hallowe'en party, that is essentially a re-run of the
Samhain, an event that was so successful two years ago. It's got groups
of drummers from Glasgow, Dundee, and Stirling, fire dancers from
Barcelona, two choirs, and fireworks. I should have thought it the
perfect kind of thing for children to enjoy.''
More pointedly, she observes that the Lesbian and Gay community are
taxpayers for whom this civic investment is a proportionately small
return. ''I think this sort of tabloid story merely reflects how far
newspapers like this have fallen behind public opinion. All the sampling
done by organisations such as Stonewall suggests that the public at
large in the UK is in favour of more equal rights. And you have to say
that any society which fails its minorities, any society which is only
interested in reflecting the needs of the majority, is a poor society
and one bereft of humanity.''
Two years on, Glasgay! clearly has less to prove. The Scottish Arts
Council, reviewing its initial investment, concluded that the debut
venture was well run and professional, with high critical values. That
is a judgment, Ditton feels, that merely reflects their initial
determination to stage nothing that could be dismissed as amateur night.
''People have asked about Glasgow being an unlikely venue for this
kind of festival, but we made it happen by being big and bold and going
for it; by making sure we kept high professional standards, which wasn't
too difficult as there is a great deal of first-rate work out there. It
brought enjoyment to a wide range of Glaswegians, and for one week at
least the gay community really felt it was their city.''
Whether there is such a thing as specifically ''gay art'' will be the
topic at one of the seminars in an extended 10-day event. But many of
the performers will certainly be icons on the lesbian and gay scene, and
many of the dramatic offerings will explore their concerns. Yet Ditton
maintains that the cornerstone of Glasgay! is that it be as inclusive as
possible.
''I am not saying Glasgay! will be all things to all people, clearly
it won't. But it should have a wide enough range so that most people can
find something in it. We're a tiny organisation without the means to do
audience research, but the first festival told us we were able to
attract many people, especially young people, who might not until then
have had an interest in the arts.
''A crossover audience, if you like, and these big events are an
attempt to make Glasgay! accessible to them. Obviously that has appeal
to the venues, and this year places like the Tron and the Citizens
theatre were not only pleased to be associated again with Glasgay!, but
have doubled their involvement. They're in business, after all. They
like productions that attract audiences, especially new ones.''
Those ''straights'' who bought tickets last time around, attracted by
luminaries such as Sir Ian McKellan with his star-studded cast at the
opening fundraiser, may roll up in greater numbers now that some of the
supposed barriers have been broken down. One of Ditton's greatest
problems in year one was trying to convince jittery public sector
benefactors that support for the festival would not find them breaching
the infamous Clause 28, which forbids any overt promotion of
homosexuality.
''In contrast, I think we've proved that anything which promotes
greater understanding between communities can only be worthwhile.''
Having proved to the satisfaction of the local authorities that
Glasgay! is a showcase rather than a recruiting agent for the community
it serves, the main concern now is to get several shows on the road.
One, a woodland expedition in search of safer sex, should certainly keep
them busy down on the Daily Mail newsdesk.
There will, however, be a pre-Glasgay! taster for non-media types who
plan to attend the Hoedown evening, successor to the '93 tea dance. Just
as pre-event ballroom classes were held for that, so, too, will there be
opportunities to learn the art of line dancing before you root out the
check shirt. According to the latest Ditton research, Country and
Western is very big in lesbian and gay clubs. There is even, she assures
me, a whole raft of gay rodeos on the American West Coast.
You will want to know, as I did, in what manner a gay rodeo differs
from the common or garden variety.
''Easy,'' says the artistic director of Glasgay!. ''It's MUCH better
dressed.''

* UNITING under the banner Blow Your Mind -- See A Show -- The Herald
and the Citizens' Theatre today unveil the result of their collaboration
in the month-long Channel 4 / British Film Institute initiative designed
to promote wider interest in the British theatre.
Sixth-form school pupils attending the Citz' workshop session of Don
Carlos last week were asked to pen a review of the performance. Those
junior critics' reviews published on this page are the pick of the crop
received from Bearsden's Boclair Academy.
SCHILLER would have been proud of both Philip Prowse's directing and
stage-designing skills which he used to bring Don Carlos to life, at the
Citizens' Theatre. The play, a story of forbidden love and political
upheaval, gave the right blend of emotional drama and humour to keep me
on the edge of my seat until the final act.
The dominating set piece rises and falls to create a sense of
claustrophobia which is echoed in Sophie Ward's excellent performance as
Queen Elizabeth. Three doors along the back of the stage also work well,
opening and shutting frequently to allow the cast to enter and exit the
stage. This device makes sure that each section of the play is
continuous, with the only breaks coming between each act.
These intervals are well placed, and gratefully received by the
audience who need the time to recover from the powerful drama of the
play, and discuss the development of the story. Such an exchange of
ideas is necessary, as Don Carlos is a complicated play which cannot be
followed unless you are prepared to listen carefully from the first to
the last word spoken.
We are, however, given some help in understanding the complex nature
of the production, through the costumes worn by the characters. The
Marquis of Posa, played by Andrew Woodall, is the best example of this
technique. His style of dress indicates a man with modern attitudes,
which, along with his superb performance, left the audience in no doubt
about his revolutionary ideals.
Giles Havergal, as King Philip, gave the play a touch of humour, which
offered the audience a little light relief. He also manages to provoke
sympathy as the lonely old man, manipulated by those who want his power,
and in love with a wife who cannot love him.
Murray Melvin who plays Domingo, however, is truly a villain whom the
audience just love to hate, and on certain occasions can cause a ripple
of laughter in the theatre. Both these performances helped to balance
the emotionally charged actions of Don Carlos, played extremely well by
Benedick Bates.
In short, Don Carlos is an exciting, emotional play, which, thanks to
Prowse's adaptation skills, a modern audience can enjoy in five dramatic
acts. It is well worth making the effort to understand this excellent
play.

THIS year's Castlemilk Writers Festival in Glasgow (from tomorrow
until Saturday) could make populism popular. It opens with poets Jackie
Kay, Jenny Diski, and Evelyn Lau (Castlemilk Library) and closes on the
Saturday (Birgidale Complex) with Hank Wangford ''talking informally''
about his new book Lost Cowboys from Patagonia to the Alamo.
There is also an intriguing series of workshops, ranging from Stuart
Hepburn (Taggart) to Starting to Write Plays, led by Tom McGrath. On
Friday, Jamaican Linton Kwesi Johnson links up with that ''barrage of
recited verse'' known selectively as Urban Poets Society.
There is one piece of inspired pairing. Initiated by departing Writer
in Residence Carl MacDougall, it is welcomed as ''made in heaven'' by
successor Gerry Loose. The reading itself will also involve Castlemilk
Writers Group member Lesley Benzie, but she will not, I hope, object to
focus being placed on the writers accompanying her (Thursday, Castlemilk
Library, 8pm).
Coupling Dubliner Paul Durcan and Belfast-born Ciaran Carson could be
seen to represent writing in the north and south of Ireland. Both share
eclectic tastes in music: Durcan chants away with Van Morrison in The
Days Before Rock and Roll, Carson is the author of the invaluable Pocket
Guide to Traditional Music (1986). Both sing and dance verbally.
As poets they deserve serious attention as entertainers. At this
year's Edinburgh Book Festival, Durcan gave an exhilarating performance.
Carson won the inaugural T S Eliot Prize (1993) for ''best collection of
new poetry'' with First Language (Gallery Press, #5.95), a celebration
for the craft of art.
The Castlemilk Writers Festival, if for no other reason, should be
supported for its part in bringing such understanding of the literary
understatement to a Scottish audience.

IF you have any doubts about the storyline in the first half, your
suspicions are quickly confirmed in the second. A mere two songs in --
with an improbable 14 to go -- the narrative just stops.
One character is pregnant and hasn't told her boyfriend, the same
boyfriend who has been secretly sleeping with her best friend; another
character has just been told his mother is really his grandmother;
nearly everyone has been insulted one way or another; and it just stops,
open-ended, unresolved.
We do eventually get a voice-over telling us what became of this
would-be sixties pop group from Skelmersdale, but it doesn't explain
what became of the plot.
Neither does it explain what became of the Liverpool accents, though a
scan down the tour schedule does suggest the company at least had the
good sense to venture no nearer to that city than Llandudno.
But, of course, no-one's here for the play. What they want are the
hits.
After all, there's more drama in any one of them than anything the
play could muster.
That's why the real heat is generated when they ditch the story and
pound straight into those final 14 songs -- a cracking Shout, a soulful
My Girl, a spikey Get Off My Cloud, and so on.
In the production as a whole, the women are better than the men,
livelier and more gutsy, especially Lesley Anne-Sharpe; Paul Hi-Di-Hi
Shane seems only to be there to draw in the punters; and if there's a
better reason than a role in The Tomorrow People to justify Mike
Holoway's star-billing, I can't imagine what it is.

WHAT would you do if you won a couple of million on the lottery? Isn't
it what we all dream about? John Godber's latest turns out to be one of
his best for some time -- a crisp little homily on the dangers of mammon
and much else besides, not least marriage.
Dramatically speaking, Godber used to be a near relative to Mike
Leigh. Now he's getting closer and closer to Ayckbourn which means his
characters still have the sting of caricature about them -- it's a
pretty devastating portrait of the domestic life of the Northern working
class -- but with a compassionate underbelly.
Lucky Sods tells the saddening tale of an ordinary couple -- Morris, a
bored security guard and his sharp-tongued, wife Jean, who suddenly
finds the knack of winning the Lottery not once but several times.
Needless to say, their ''good luck'' turns out to be of a double-edged
variety. Money, in fact, pushes them apart -- or rather, highlights the
emotional chasm between them which Godber, in the very first, very funny
scene, indicates with livid accuracy.
But then, the whole thing has the stab of emotional truth about it,
from the envious, slighted relatives to the senile, bedridden mother to
Morris's old girlfriend taking him and his new-found affluence for a
ride.
Godber's Hull Truck company, too, boasts some wonderfully colourful,
detailed performances from Iain Rogerson and Christine Cox as the
ill-starred Morris and Jean and Janet Dibley (stunning as Morris's ex,
Connie) and Nicholas Lane as the family relations from hell and various
other guises.

Winners of this year's Scottish Tourism Oscars, sponsored by Caithness
Glass, Grampian Television, and The Herald, receive their awards of
Caithness glass today in the Turnberry Hotel. Lesley Duncan describes
the quest
THERE were unexpected encounters en route. With Andy for example. His
long, melancholy face and tightly-curled wig gave him an air of judicial
wisdom. How infra dig, then, to be throwing him buns -- and even more
infra dig of him to gobble them the way he did. But, of course, Andy was
a goat -- albeit a very special one to qualify as a denizen of the Rare
Breeds Farm Park, Oban.
There was also esoteric information to be gleaned. Why, for one thing,
Cornish pasties have rims round the edges. The reason -- learned at
Corpach, near Fort William -- was to allow miners to eat the edible bit
in the middle without contaminating it with arsenic from their hands.
The four days on the road with fellow judges of the Scottish Tourism
Oscars were full of such unexpected revelations.
The Scottish Tourism Oscars, Herald readers will remember, are awarded
annually in several categories of excellence. This year the judges were
looking for Scotland's best tourism town, best tourism village, best
overall tourist attraction, best on-the-water attraction, and most
glorious garden. There was also an additional category, best new tourist
attraction. Nominations by Herald readers were our starting point.
Now, with a short leet drawn up, the judges -- Alistair Mair, chairman
and managing director of Caithness Glass, George Mitchell, director of
programmes for Grampian TV, Valerie Gogan, star of TV's Hamish Macbeth,
and myself -- caught up with each other and the accompanying Grampian
Television crew one wet Sunday morning at Custom House Quay, Greenock.
Our objective -- a short trip on the paddle steamer Waverley, a
popular nomination in the on-the-water category. While the TV team
focused on the mesmerising rhythms of the 2100-horsepower engines, the
judges sampled the views from the deck. Small yachts were out in force,
but the peerless Clyde scenery was sadly -- and uncharacteristically for
this summer -- rain-wrapped. Waverley would be in direct competition
with Sea Life Surveys of Mull and Loch Insh watersports complex in
Inverness-shire.
We disembarked at Largs, which was on the short leet for the best town
award. A visit to Kelburn Country Park was enlivened by the commentary
of the owner, Lord Glasgow. The Secret Forest Walk, through thickets of
rhododendron to treetop-high vantage points, brought out the young
explorers in all of us. Largs Yacht Haven won plaudits for its
amenities. The Barrfields redevelopment -- incorporating Vikingar! --
though unfinished when we saw it, offers the town not only leisure
facilities and a fine theatre-cum-cinema, due to be completed in
November, but perspectives on its Viking connection (1263 and all that).
The judges admired these initiatives, though felt the town centre could
be improved -- and that was before the train crash!
Over to Bute the next morning to visit Mount Stuart, the red-sandstone
mansion of the Bute family, opened for the first time to the public with
its 300 acres of grounds in June. Its neo-gothic magnificence awed
everyone, particularly the great hall with its profusion of choice
marbles and stained glass. It has established itself instantly as a
major new focus for tourism. Its challenger in the best new attraction
category would be Duff House, Banff.
Via the Colintraive ferry to the Younger Botanic Garden, Benmore. Here
the avenue of giant redwoods, planted in the 1860s, puts mortals in
their place. Its rhododendrons are famed in springtime.
Inveraray, a contender in the best village category, was next on the
itinerary. The jail, its courtroom stocked with life-like figures and
dramatised transcripts of court cases, had won a past award in its own
right. Could the additional attraction of the schooner museum, Arctic
Penguin, and the white-painted houses clinch the wider award? Ballater
was its rival.
Next stop Oban and thence by ferry to Mull, where Sea Life Surveys
offer the possibility of seeing whales, dophins, and porpoises in the
wild. We admired the scientific commitment shown but, without going to
sea, could only guess at the impact of an actual sighting. Back, then,
to Oban and, thankfully, a few hours' respite from our punishing
schedule.
This judge rather dreaded the next morning's visit to the Rare Breeds
Farm Park, run by vet Kay Simpson and Duncan Strachan. Might it not be
rather messy and malodorous? Fears were confounded. It turned out to be
a charming place, set on a hillside with fine views of the Argyllshire
landscape. The livestock, ranging from rare sheep to ''dumpy'' hens and
a supercilious lama, were all in immaculate condition. A tiny Highland
calf with cinnamon eyes and coat was the scene-stealer of the tour.
Corpach next. Here the Treasures of the Earth Museum is located in a
former church. The judges admired the graphic presentation, complete
with miners' buggies and painted dinosaur. The crystals themselves,
particularly the huge amethyst-filled rocks like glittering natural
sculptures, were eyecatching. But the decision in the best tourist
attraction category finally went to the living attractions of the rare
breeds farm.
Our intrepid chauffeuses, Irene and Anne, wheeled us off then, via
Inverness, Nairn, and Elgin, to Duff House, Banff, officially opened by
the Prince of Wales in June as an outstation of the National Galleries
of Scotland. This splendidly restored William Adam mansion with its
pictures ranging from exquisite Ramsays to an El Greco impressed the
judges. But finally they were to opt unanimously for the more flamboyant
charms of Mount Stuart in the best new attraction category. Both places
could hold their own in any international rating.
The long day was not over yet. Down to Crathes and Royal Deeside. The
long-established gardens at Crathes -- with their outpouring of colours
and scents round the fairybook castle -- captivated everyone.
The sunny evening was casting long shadows when we reached Ballater,
Inveraray's rival for best village. The douce, clean streets and the
enthusiasm of the local business community, coupled with a refusal to
exploit the royal connection, impressed the judges enough for them to
award Ballater the best village accolade.
Tomintoul, here we came, en route to our watering and resting place at
Grantown-on-Spey at the end of a marathon day. Judges, tourist board
organisers, and the TV team all met for a meal on this final night,
camaraderie strong after the accumulated experiences of three days on
the road together.
There were three more ports of call the next day. The first was Loch
Insh Watersports Centre, Kincraig. A party of Glasgow children were
combining an unexpected holiday with initiation into sailing. And how
they were enjoying themselves -- a colourful band soon dispersed into
the equally colourful sailing boats that dotted the loch.
Not for the first time, individual initiative was to prove the
clinching consideration. The tenacity of owner Clive Freshwater in
pursuing his vision impressed everyone, as did the centre's shipshape
accommodation in the converted village hall. By a majority vote, Loch
Insh beat the Waverley as the on-the-water winner.
Aberfeldy vied with Largs as best town. It is, everyone agreed, a
delightful spot with its birks and oatmeal mill and immaculate streets.
However, the judges, taking into account the greater challenge facing
local authority and private initiatives in Largs, finally opted for the
latter.
There was one last garden to visit -- the Versailles-like acres at
Drummond Castle. Filmgoers to Rob Roy will have caught glimpses of the
garden's marble statues and fountains, peacocks, and formal plantings of
roses enclosed by box. Imposing as Drummond is, it had to yield to
Crathes on grounds of sheer high-summer loveliness.
Congratulations to the winners and the admirable runners-up. Our
700-and more-mile sortie through Scotland had not only revealed an
abundance of places to visit, but reminded us of the varied beauty of
Scottish landscapes -- perhaps in the end the greatest tourist
attraction of all.

A COUPLE of weeks back, I attended a dinner in East Kilbride to bid
farewell to the local new town development corporation. We were a trifle
premature saying goodbye in mid-September. The corporation does not
formally wind itself up until the last day of December.
But managing director John Shaw departs early next month for a new
life in the private sector. So the reminiscence chest was unlocked three
months early in the boardroom at Atholl House.
After the 48 years East Kilbride Development Corporation has spent
transforming a small Lanarkshire village into a thriving industrial and
commercial town of more than 70,000 people, the evening could have
turned into a rather tearful, nostalgic wake.
In fact it proved a happy, upbeat affair, the mood reinforced, after
the meal, by a radical reworking of traditional Scottish pipe and drum
music by Macumba, a group as influenced by Caribbean steel bands as by
Shotts &amp; Dykehead's finest.
But beneath the surface good cheer, as senior staff and board members,
past and present, swopped a near-half century of memories with their
guests, the disenchantment over the demise of Scotland's five new towns
was palpable. The mood was encapsulated in a short passage in John
Shaw's speech, when he warned: ''We in Scotland have few enough tools
(for economic development) in our hands, without throwing away some of
the ones that work.''
EKDC's last full operational annual report, for the year to last
March, is stuffed with evidence that the new town approach has indeed
worked. East Kilbride today boasts 950 local businesses, 400 of them
industrial, employing some 34,000 people. The big names, like Motorola,
which has invested some #400m in the town since it arrived in 1970, rub
shoulders with smaller local fry.
The development corporation has invested an average of #19.5m a year
in infrastructure over the past 10 years but returned a surplus to the
Scottish Office, after loan charges, in every single year from 1969 to
1993.
The total paid back, as the last chairman Harley Marshall points out
in his annual statement, comes to #126m, to which should be added a
further #55.5m in corporation tax payments. And, although all that
physical and economic development has been achieved side-by-side with
regular refunds to the public purse, registered unemployment in East
Kilbride District, at 6.7%, is the fourth lowest in Strathclyde, after
Eastwood, Bearsden &amp; Milngavie, and Strathkelvin.
There are still plenty of jokes around about new towns as bland urban
mazes where every roundabout looks like every other roundabout and
getting hopelessly lost is the daily fate of the unwary visitor. Indeed
we heard some such stories at the dinner. But the range of amenities and
employment opportunities in places like East Kilbride puts them,
arguably, well ahead of more venerable urban settlements in winning the
affection and loyalty of those who choose to live in them.
Even if you conclude that, after 48 years, East Kilbride is in danger
of apeing Bearsden Academy's best-known former pupil in clinging to its
description as a new town, you might have expected some of the
development skills built up over nearly five decades, which made all
this happen, to be offered fresh challenges elsewhere in Scotland after
wind-up.
Sadly that does not appear to be happening. There was plenty of brave
talk, when the Government's plans for winding up the special status of
the new towns were first debated six years ago, of preserving some of
these group skills on a contractual basis. But the kind of petty
jealousies and rivalries which bedevil Scottish public life have put
paid to that.
A few staff are transferring to the local enterprise companies which,
together with Scottish Enterprise and the relevant local authorities,
are assuming responsibility for economic development in the former new
towns. But the numbers are small. And the fractious nature of that
handover, in East Kilbride's case, is made crystal clear in the last
annual report.
Having noted that two EKDC staff transferred to the Lanarkshire
Development Agency during the year, the report continues: ''The
corporation's chairman, deputy chairman, and managing director have
recently met with their opposite numbers within the LDA to offer
whatever assistance and support might be required by them. It is noted
that they required no assistance from the corporation.''
Given the chilly relationship implied by these words, it is no
surprise that no-one from the LDA or indeed Scottish Enterprise was
present at the recent farewell dinner. They weren't invited.
Continuity is equally under threat on a second front. Despite
occasional ups and downs, the relationship between East Kilbride
Development Corporation and East Kilbride District Council has been
consistently constructive. But wind-up coincides with local government
reorganisation. From next April East Kilbride becomes part of the new
South Lanarkshire authority. And, again, old scores are apparently being
settled.
It is no secret that elected Labour councillordom in Scotland has long
detested the unelected new town corporations. There is also a strong
streak of resentment that so much of the post-war economic regeneration
effort and such a large slice of inward investment was directed to the
five Scottish new towns.
In South Lanarkshire, the political momentum has swung decisively to
the Hamilton-Cambuslang axis. One of the early casualties of the new
set-up has been East Kilbride District Council's well-regarded director
of planning and development, who lost out in the contest for the
equivalent South Lanarkshire post and has now taken his skills elsewhere
in the new structure.
After 48 years of being one of the new kids on the block, enjoying a
disproportionate share of the economic development cake, East Kilbride
may find that, in its urban maturity, life under the LDA on the one hand
and South Lanarkshire Council on the other, will be a lot less
rewarding.

ON an Aberdeenshire doorstep last April, during the local council
elections, a woman of English birth, upbringing, and accent was
surprised by a Liberal Democrat canvasser. ''You know,'' said he darkly,
''if the SNP ever get independence, the first thing they'll do is deport
all the English from Scotland -- you too.''
''Well,'' said the lady, ''that's a great surprise. I've been a member
of the SNP for years and they've never told me that.''
Such tactics -- or letters of the sort we published yesterday, from
Labour princes George Robertson and Norman Hogg -- debase the political
process and demean those who resort to them. They feed on fear, of
course -- the extraordinary reluctance of Scots to seize control of
their own destiny -- but, most of all, they feed on ignorance. The
Scottish National Party has been around for 60 years and been a
mainstream, parliamentary presence throughout my lifetime. Why is she so
widely misunderstood, misrepresented, and defamed?
At the party conference in Perth last week, scanning the press, or
talking to visiting journalists from England, I rapidly wearied of the
prevalent inability to understand what was going on, or to grasp the
character of the party met in the City Halls.
A wild speech by one marginalised SNP figure was hyped up as evidence
of a major split. Hacks from London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow romped
happily round Perth seeking division and dissent that weren't there.
Analysis of the Saturday elections veered wildly (depending on which
paper you read) from ''Salmond critics vanquished'' to ''Salmond
humiliated as critics survive''.
For those sufficiently versed in SNP history, however, and who
actually bothered to go out to talk to ordinary party delegates instead
of comparing notes with other journalists, last week came as little
surprise. Only the most naive, for example, would rate George
Robertson's ''leaked memo'' as anything more than a cynical spoiling
tactic, timed to disrupt the first day of conference.
And anyone who knows the SNP understands that it is a movement as much
as a party, still very much a coalition of differing philosophies and
emphases, united only in the primary quest for independence. So, come
annual elections for office, the mass of SNP activists vote in a
deliberate exercise of ''balancing the ticket'', voting for personality
and campaigning gifts rather than a narrow ideological line.
These activists are sophisticated people. They had the sense to keep
to the winning formula as far as formal posts were concerned; the SNP is
doing well, so all incumbents were easily returned. SNP veterans, too,
know that an SNP MP has yet successfully to defend a seat seized in a
by-election, and so properly declined to elect Roseanna Cunningham to a
prominent portfolio until she has bedded herself down in Perth. (But,
characteristically, they put her top of the poll in the second round, as
an NEC elected member.)
Jim Mitchell, however, did not make it. Mitchell is an original and
able character, who has built up a strong SNP base in Renfrewshire, and
did much in the eighties to revive interest in such forgotten parts of
Scots history as the 1820 Insurrection. But, last week, his judgment
deserted him. He made an over-the-top speech, on the first and very dull
day of conference, which played straight into the hands of a press
desperate for signs of divided ranks. His language in that speech -- and
he actually used such words as ''traitor'' and ''Uncle Tom'' -- was of a
sort the SNP has long since repudiated, almost calculated to frighten
voters off the party.
Mitchell's biggest gaffe, however, came on Friday morning, when he
demanded (as if by right) to be called to speak in another devolution
debate, and made the most childish spectacle of himself when denied. To
bound up to the platform for a word in the chairman's ear, trying to
inveigle Gordon Wilson into a personal favour under some old pal's act,
was an act of political suicide. The following morning the foot-soldiers
voted the prima donna off the National Executive Committee. This Army is
egalitarian and its officers forget it at their peril.
There is a division in the SNP, but it is one of emotion and
personality, rather than of principle. Certain senior party figures are
not on overly friendly terms with Alex Salmond, SNP leader. Some have
different bogeymen: Iain Lawson and Kenny MacAskill, for example, have a
particular loathing of the Labour Party, at odds -- now and again --
with a wider SNP loathing of the Tories.
And some have different memories. Those active in the seventies have
never forgotten how easily the ''First Eleven'' MPs were rolled by the
Whitehill system, and how neatly the devolution fiasco of 1979 was
pinned on the SNP, rather than on the Labour Government responsible for
it. Now they have an eerie deja vu. They deem the return of a Labour
Government inevitable, and fear re-runs of old nightmares.
What was not to be found at Perth, however, was any serious beef
against the leadership. Salmond, who has always enjoyed the respect of
his party, is beginning to win their affection. He has kept about him a
team representing all wings and emotions of the party. He has won for
the SNP the increasing marks of a professional political force --
excellent media relations, an efficient office, systematic fund-raising,
and such delights as the network live TV cast of his Friday speech. (And
it was, by the way, a very good speech -- logical, entertaining, and
passionate.)
Only a strong party could have survived, and come back, from the 1992
disappointment as well as the SNP. And the party has continued to expand
its base. It has built, in fewer than two years, a formidable presence
in local government. It has cohered as a left-wing, commonsense
alternative to a time-served and decadent Labour machine. Winnie Ewing
now has a colleague in Europe. In Roseanna Cunningham, the party has an
MP who, granted re-election in Perth, will in a few years be a credible
alternative leader. That's good for the party and, in a disciplining
sort of way, good for Alex Salmond.
One still wonders if the SNP's General Election aim -- a
one-fell-swoop bid for a majority of Scottish seats -- is a realistic
target. And some of the policies passed by conference last week --
which, mercifully, most papers were too busy to note in detail -- were
the stuff of left-wing, tax-and-spend, politically correct never-never
land. But the SNP is back. It's growing. It's formidable. And it's
making George Robertson and Norman Hogg very, very nervous. How sad.

AS ScottishPower pursues its bid to take over the Manweb electricity
company, there is speculation over what any new merged company will be
called.
The subject was indeed discussed at a meeting of the Scottish
Electricity Consumers' Committee at which a number of ScottishPower high
heid yins were in attendance. The chairman of the said committee,
Professor Tom Carbery, said it would not be entirely appropriate for the
name ScottishPower to be popping up all over Wales from Rhyl to that
place which begins Llan and goes on for another couple of dozen letters.
A new name was needed which would reflect Scotland and Wales. What
better than CelticPower which incorporated all of the Celtic fringe.
The ScottishPower representatives winced visibly at Professor
Carbery's suggestion. The prof is a well-known follower of Celtic FC and
not averse to a spot of gentle tweaking of the noses of ScottishPower
who see fit to invest in executive hospitality with Rangers and Partick
Thistle but not with Celtic.
He is very much looking forward to the first CelticPower table in the
executive suite at Ibrox.

ALWAYS up to something interesting, that boy Richard Branson of record
company, airline, and vodka and cola fame. As part of the preparations
for his upcoming round-the-world balloon flight, he was at a party last
night in a Mongolian barbecue restaurant in Leith.
Well, nearly. Branson was attending the opening of Kublai Khan's in
Assembly Street, Leith, which has been set up by one Alisdair McRobbie,
whose other job when he is not running a Mongolian barbecue is flying
planes for Virgin on the Hong Kong and Tokyo routes.
On Branson's guest list at Leith was former Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir
Dzhanibekov who is now head of the Russian space agency. Vladimir is
acting as an adviser to Branson on his planned 20-day, non-stop balloon
flight round the world. He is a handy man to have on board since the
last balloon to try to cross Russia was shot down.
For those of you interested in ballooning, the Branson craft is one
and a half times the size of the Albert Hall, will fly at 40,000ft and
will be the biggest-ever blip on the world's radar.
For those of you more interested in Mongolian barbecueing as it is
done at Kublai Khan's, the deal is that you choose various bits of
finely sliced meat from a cold shelf, plonk it in a bowl and concoct
your own marinade from a selection of oils, spices, and herbs.
It is then cooked on a huge circular sizzling hot-plate and served
with rice. This is based on how the warriors used to cook their tea on
their shields over a fire after a hard day at the raping and pillaging.
The things you learn at the Herald Diary.
Road to nowhere
COLIN Begg of North Kelvinside, Glasgow, writes to admit to a strange
interest, to whit acronyms of city transport systems. With the imminent
demise of Strathclyde Regional Council and the prospect of trams
reappearing on Glasgow streets, Mr Begg is agog at the prospect of
finding a more entertaining name than the existing Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Evecutive.
It could be Big Orange Train and Tram Operation Management -- Bottom.
Or Glasgow, Lanark, Ayr, Inverclyde, and Kilmarnock Integrated Transport
-- Glaikit. Our favourite is the unwieldy but quite nostalgic Area Unit
for the Control, Handling, Enablement, Networking and Supervision of
Hasty Urban transport in the Greater Glasgow Local Environment --
Auchenshuggle for short.
C'moan get aff, as the clippies of yesteryear were wont to say.
Hearts attack
THERE will be singing and dancing on the prairies of Saskatchewan at
Hibernian FC's victory over Rangers. Saskatchewan is the unlikely centre
of knowledge about all things to do with the Hibs on the information
superway.
A chap by the name of Colin Macpherson at the University of
Saskatchewan has set up Hibs Hypertext, an electronic fanzine, on the
internet.
So, what information about the Hibees has been winging its way
electronically to farthest Canada? Mostly, old cuttings from the
Scottish sports pages to be honest.
One of the sections looked promising -- the Albert Kidd Home Page, a
page for maligning Jambos. Through the wonders of technology, people all
over the universe now have access to the words of that song about ''the
boys in maroon are the shite o' the toon''. Progress or what?
Name game
ORGANISER of an Institute of Public Relations seminar on the
Millennium Commission is one Charmaine Easie-Grant. The lady who reads
the traffic news on a San Diego radio station is an Elaine Closure. We
notice, also, that the company Fran Fashions trading as Now and Forever
has gone into liquidation. A fax to this office from the Liberal
Democrats bears the hopeful identification code ''Votes R Us''.
Poor excuse
WE do not wish to make light of bereavement or indeed of those caught
in the poverty trap. The current issue of the Greenock Benefit Agency
newsletter does this for us.
It reports: ''New arrangements were introduced on September 5
regarding Social Fund funeral payments. The new rules will ensure the
cash goes to those who need it most -- people on low incomes with a good
reason for arranging funerals.''
The Diary suggests, as a rule of thumb, that a good reason for a
funeral is when a person is deceased.
But matters are not so simple as the newletter also reports: ''Claims
for a Social Fund funeral payment for a death prior to June 5, where the
funeral takes place on or before September 5, will be decided under the
old rules.'' The message is obvious: get granny out of the freezer and
lay her to rest under the new, improved rules.
Bravery awards
WE mentioned the new BBC Scotland Gaelic comedy series Ran Dan and
said we could not find the origin of the phrase widely used to describe
a person as being out for a night on the tiles. Bill McKelvie of Wishaw
is better than we are at looking up dictionaries.
He writes: ''According to my copy of Maclennan's Gaelic dictionary dan
means intrepid and ran means roaring. I think you would agree that
intrepid roaring is a good description of what is meant by going on the
ran dan.'' Quite right, Mr McKelvie, many's the Gael of our acquaintance
who has ended the night totally intrepid.

WE can only hope that present downpours don't obscure the
philosophical nature of Trevor Newton's toilet habits in times of
drought. His strategy, after all, raises an interesting question: do we
really need to work ourselves into the full lather of modern hygiene
ever again?
Of course there remains in this country a cussed generation which has
always mistrusted daily bathing, believing it to be the kind of
namby-pambyism which has led to Britain's rot. Such adherents (and many
of them exist in Newton's Yorkshire Water catchment), cling to the quick
rub down with a chunk of carbolic because they see in that stark
cleanliness the moral rectitude on which this country was founded. ''An
inside lavvy,'' snorted an old Barnsley miner last week, ''don't make me
laugh. There's nobody putting that dirty object in my house.''
Ripples of similar fundamentalism surround Newton's insistence that
for the past three weeks he has not taken either a shower or a bath but
only shaved and washed using one niggardly cup of water at a time.
No-one, he maintains, has noticed any difference, but this is where
Newton's law seems doubtful: since his family have been following the
same regime they are hardly in a position to detect any high-whiff
surplus. And who among a managing director's subordinates is likely to
protest about anti-social vapours in the boardroom?
Such quibbles aside, we can nevertheless be thankful to Newton for
bringing into the open one more of our guilty pleasures. We might not
confess it loudly but among the weekend's joys is that chance to relish
the indolence of going unwashed. As it happens the slatternly male, in
particular, now has science on his side, for chemists insist that men's
natural odours are far more sexually potent to women than any lyrical
cologne.
There may be something in this. Long before Tarzan swung down from the
rope, sweat must have been some woman's aphrodisiac, but what scientists
are talking about are not the fetid aromas which hang around poly-cotton
armholes. Instead they are concentrating on that magical, old essence
called a pheromone. Although barely detected by the human nose the
pheremone possesses the power to make women in men's company melt into a
mood for love.
Now much of that may sound like a male scientist's self-serving
manifesto, but the basic worry for a man is this: if there is no obvious
hint of pheremones in the air how can a chap be sure he possesses a
sufficient quantity in the first place? More pertinently, if the
pheremone is such a beguiling agent why do so many millions of women
insist on buying torrid fragrances for blokes?
But the beauty of slovenly time-off extends beyond abandoned ablutions
to take in sloppy apparel as well. Why else is the jam-stained dressing
gown such a comfortable fixture of Saturday morning? Or that sweatshirt
whose grime about the neck and cuffs might otherwise condemn it to a
floor cloth? Mind you, what people wear in the intimacy of their homes
would probably provide more creative impulses than any couturier could
muster in a lifetime.
That tatty velour bathrobe with threads hanging from the hem is such a
favourite in so many otherwise respectable households, it must be
Freudian. We know of one beautician who goes for the slapstick of cold
cream and curlers on a Sunday, neatly accessorising her M&amp;S pyjamas with
a lightweight poncho which allows her to postpone the chore of dressing
properly all day.
There is at least one lawyer who picks dirty clothes up off the floor,
only to put them on and venture out so as to blitz his weight training
at Baskin Robbins. And what about that relaxing surgeon whose weekend
wear consists of faded green hospital scrub-suits and those fuzzy golf
socks with pom-poms on the heel?
But why is it that every time a woman rushes out for Saturday's
newspapers, wearing one of her private, little Bride-of-Frankenstein
numbers -- the kaftan with dropped egg on the pocket -- she bumps into
the neighbourhood glamour-puss stunning in fishnets and stilettos? What
matter? Even fashionplates must occasionally plonk their butts on the
idle cushions of slobdom.
So, it has taken Trevor Newton's stingy, personal washing methods to
remind us that often what we most enjoy about time to ourselves is
mooching around the house, looking like a garbage heap incarnate. Funny
how being a slob is as much a self-indulgent thing as being the perfect
dandy.

IF you are feeling a little peeved that you have never won an Employee
of the Month competition in your workplace, now is your chance to get
your own back. Why not enter your boss in the new award scheme to find
Scotland's best managers? The Prime Awards seek employees' views of
their managers' performances through a form of upward appraisal.
Sponsored by the training organisation Eglington Management Centre,
the scheme was launched earlier in the month with more than 1000
nomination forms issued to companies and organisations all around the
country.
Participating employees complete a simple questionnaire following
which some go on to be interviewed on different issues which seek to
examine the quality of the relationship between the employee and his or
her manager.
Statements such as ''My manager delegates the right amount of work to
me'' or ''My manager listens to my comments'' are put to the employees
and the results are measured on a scale of ''strongly agree'' to
''strongly disagree''.
The results from 50 or so type statements are then used to calculate
an overall ''morale'' index, giving an objective measure of satisfaction
on the part of the group of employees. The winner of the award is the
manager with the highest index.
A team of judges from industry, the public sector and the human
resources profession will assess applications and visit short-listed
work teams to see why they think their manager is special.
The chairman of the judging panel, Peter Casebow of The Royal Bank of
Scotland, explains the background to the awards . . .
''Two years ago a group of managers from different companies came
together in the Scottish Executive Challenge in order to improve
Scottish management. The crucial question was: ''Is Scottish management
our own worst enemy?''
''We came up with the idea of an award using upward appraisal, since
most awards are given to the great and good by the great and good. In
this case the opinion of the staff would emerge.''
It is not uncommon to find the words ''our staff are our most
important asset'' in a company's annual report, and many organisations
use an employee opinion survey to help measure the effectiveness of this
asset. But it is a very blunt instrument, and the next logical step is
to use a form of upward feedback which will show individual managers how
their behaviour has an effect on their staff.
The process originated in the USA where subordinates, usually
anonymously, appraise various aspects of management behaviour. In
Britain, most organisations use the process as an aid to managerial
development, but one company, Federal Express Logistics, actually uses
it as a formal appraisal of management. In one instance, Federal Express
removed a senior manager from a very profitable unit because he received
poor marks in the upward appraisal reviews.
Afterwards profits rose, leading the company to the conclusion that
the manager concerned was holding back a potentially profitable
business.
A recent survey of five UK companies using the ''upward appraisal''
process all felt that it was well worth the cost. Such benefits
included: lower staff turnover, improved communication, training needs
analysis, a measure of the effectiveness of management training and a
link established between good management practice and customer
satisfaction and profit.
According to Peter Casebow, the drawbacks to such a scheme are
surprisingly limited considering the sensitivity of the subject.
Although some managers were suspicious at the start, they soon
experienced the positive effects of the process and came to regard it as
a powerful managerial tool benefiting communications, teamwork and
empowerment.
However, as Peter Casebow warns, it could backfire on companies that
introduce it as a kind of ''flavour of the month'' technique. Managers
must be willing and prepared to change, particularly where they receive
challenging feedback.
Managing director of Eglington Management Centre, Margaret Ford says:
''This is quite different from previous awards because nominations come
from the people who matter.''
Work teams score their manager against a set of criteria which
represent good management practice and then say why, in their opinion,
the management is highly effective. The Prime Awards are designed to
highlight how important it is for managers to support, motivate and
empower their staff.
The response to such an award at the moment is uncertain. The
organisers are hopeful that many different companies will pick up the
gauntlet.
However, the reward of 15,000 for management development and team
development training donated by Eglington Management Centre will
hopefully provide an incentive. There will be two Prime Awards. One for
small organisations with up to 100 employees, the other for larger
organisations with 100 plus employees.
Nomination forms are available from Eglington Management Centre, 28
Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh EH3 7RN. Tel 0131 226 2400. Closing date
for entries is October 16.

IF chartered accountants are indeed dull and boring, someone should
have told Kerry McKenzie. She qualifies as a CA next month and has found
life anything but a row of silly old figures.
''Figures play an important part, obviously,'' she says, ''but the job
is stimulating and when you work as part of an audit team you find
yourself inter-acting both with them and with the client's staff. You
also are given more and more responsibility as time goes on.''
Kerry knew from second year at Mackie Academy, Stonehaven, that she
wanted to be an accountant. She liked figures, possibly because her
father was a maths teacher, and some friends of the family were in the
profession.
So when she left in 1989 with six Highers (Maths, English, Chemistry,
Accounting, French and Physics) she headed for Heriot Watt University in
Edinburgh for an Accountancy &amp; Finance course. After three years she
graduated BA and decided it was time to get some practical experience
rather than spend another year gaining an Honours qualification.
She had in any case been offered a job in the Edinburgh audit
department of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the Big Six in the accountancy
field, so took the plunge as an audit trainee. This is a normal way into
accountancy, the other main option being entering via the tax
department.
For the next three years she gained experience in auditing, tax and
accountancy as part of the Ernst &amp; Young team, providing assurance to
management and shareholders, and gaining overall experience in
partnerships and privately-owned businesses.
She is still doing that, in an ever-more senior capacity and dealing
with a cross-section of clients in the fields of manufacturing,
retailing, investment and unit trusts, and oil and gas production. All
of this experience goes towards the final qualification as a CA.
Meanwhile, she has had to sit two important and rather difficult
examinations -- TPC1 and TPC2. TPC stands for Test of Professional
Competence and Kerry passed the second within the past couple of months.
Her three-year training contract ends this month and becoming a CA is
the reward for a great deal of hard work. ''TPC1 and TPC2 are harder
than any school or university exams,'' she says, ''and they entail a lot
of studying at home. Fortunately, my own particular firm gives you
plenty of time off -- several weeks, in fact, before each exam -- to do
some serious studying.''
It comes as a surprise to learn that a degree in Accountancy &amp; Finance
is not necessarily a prerequisite for entering the profession. Someone
with a degree in French, or Chemistry, for example, can be deemed to
have shown an ability to learn.
In their case, however, they have to sit extra professional exams at
an early stage, and undergo much more intensive training to bring them
up to speed with those who have accountancy or business degrees.
Kerry's three years have seen her progress to the stage where she now
specialises in large privately-owned companies and small listed
companies. She revels in the responsibility and enjoys the social life.
''There are nine of us in my year and we all go out as a crowd,'' she
says.
''We all have the same interests, and when there are exams to be sat
it's beneficial to have the support of your peers.''
Somehow it doesn't seem a dull life at all.

YOU won't find a firmer advocate of going back to school than Patricia
Sweeney, a 35-year-old adult returner at Denny High in Denny, Central
region. Patricia, the mother of a five year old boy, Anthony, is almost
evangelical in her promotion of the good news about widening community
and individual access to school.
Her sister-in-law, Irene Black, is living proof of Patricia's
persuasive powers. She is staying with Patricia's family while she has a
cottage renovated. Patricia recalled last week: ''Irene saw me studying
at home. She didn't get her Higher English when she was at school and
wondered about trying again. I said: ''Why don't you go for it?'' She
has, and she's really enjoying the experience.''
Irene is now going onto the committee which manages the Denny High
wider access to school project, an urban programme funded by Central
Region and the Scottish Office which encourages adults in the local
community to make the most of educational opportunities at the school.
Adult returners have a lounge at the school and have secured a room
which will give greater scope for running more classes. There is a
playgroup which allows some mothers the opportunity to take advantage of
the project. Nearly 50 adults joined pupils in certificate classes last
year, while a further 26 took part in a class run by Falkirk further
education college. More than 170 adults were involved in leisure
classes, while another 81 took part in personal development classes.
Writing in the project's annual report, Denny High rector Frank Ellis
says: ''The staff of the school have supported the project admirably
throughout the session, and many have expressed their pleasure in the
contribution made to their classes by committed and enthusiastic
adults.''
Patricia Sweeney is more than happy to return the complimentto the
school. ''I thought the adults would be separated off from the rest of
the pupils, but we aren't. I was greatly surprised because the kids have
been terrific. I thought they would be put off by us being there but
they have been friendly and brilliant. The teachers are superb. When I
was at school as a teenager it was very authoritarian but nowadays it's
a much more relaxed atmosphere.''
Patricia had left school at 17 with a couple of Highers and positive
memories of her time in the classroom. She stopped working to have her
son, then found she ''wasn't doing anything''.
She learned about the wider access project and enrolled with the aim
of studying history. ''I've enjoyed it so much that I've just carried
on,'' she said. Last year she took two Highers and this session is
taking sixth year studies courses in English and history, as well as a
classics Higher.
Patricia plans to go on to Stirling University to take a BA degree in
education and history, which will enable her to teach.
Her advice to other adults pondering a return through the school
gates? ''It's a lot easier than you think it's going to be. You just
need to take one step and you're there. I hope there will be more adults
in schools, because I'm sure they have a lot to offer, and a lot to
gain.''

ANVAR KHAN discusses football and the male libido
SIZE isn't everything, but the biggest thrill in a man's life is
football, not women. He may never find his dream girl but he can support
who he likes, so ultimately, it's the game not the dame which influences
how he does in bed. For new research, soon to be published in the
scientific press, says that football can be good for a man's sex life,
as long as his team wins.
Scientists carried out the research on two groups of men while they
watched last year's World Cup final between Brazil and Italy. They took
saliva samples -- which were later analysed for testosterone -- before
and after the game, which Brazil won on penalties. The researchers, from
Georgia State University, found that the average testosterone levels of
the Brazilian fans increased by 27.6%, compared to a 26.7% decrease in
the Italian men.
There is nothing more pitiful than fans clodhopping home after the
game, bowed and cowed because their team got beat. There is nothing more
predictable, than that primate pride when they win. Now the whole gamut
of male feeling, from A to C, because a man's emotional alphabet is much
shorter than a woman's, can be explained.
''Testosterone, and the feeling of power associated with it, increases
as subjects bask in reflected glory and decreases as they experience
vicarious defeat,'' say Julie Fielden and Candice Lutter, the two
psychologists who ran the experiment.
This is probably why some guys like to follow the best team. Nothing
to do with loyalty. They know, deep down inside that a football team,
like a car, showcases virility. And every time their team wins they feel
more like men. It's hard to understand why a spectator sport has such an
active effect.
Take Rangers supporters, for example. They are obsessed with winning.
They really fancy themselves when Rangers win, as if it had something to
do with them. Clubs back-up such feelings of participation, by swearing
that the fans are the most important of all. It must be the only game
where loud, foul-mouthed louts are appreciated.
Women have PMT, and post-menopausal depression, men have post-match
blues. Fieldon and Lutter observed clear differences in behaviour
between the two groups of fans after the game. ''Some Brazilians were
arrested for riotous celebration in the streets. The Italian men looked
depressed and apathetic.'' So unnerved were fans on the losing side,
that they ''had to be pursued into the parking lot by the experimenter
to collect post-game samples''.
The results of this research will rekindle the debate over whether
raised levels of testosterone in football fans increases their
propensity for violence. That's fair. Any girl in a football crowd at a
live match or at the bus stop can feel the craziness of bubbling
testosterone emanating from their every desperate pore. What could be
the solution? The taking of oestrogen at the turnstiles?
There is nothing more curious than the sight of excited men wrapping
their legs around each other. Without wanting to cast a dubious light on
anyone's off-pitch shenanigans, there is still the question of sexual
arousal. Indeed, to celebrate winning goals, players do a great line in
fertility rituals; the conga, the Toulouse-Lautrec shuffle and the
groin-shimmy.
Men can be classed, it seems, as lovers by the team they support. Your
fun, girls, could be a sad toss-up between AC Milan and Motherwell, and
I know which team I'd prefer.

LAST week's revelations that 32-year-old Brian MacKinnon had
successfully passed himself off as Brandon Lee, 17, to study Highers at
Bearsden Academy, brought to public notice a fact already well known to
teachers, pupils and researchers -- for the past 10 years adults have
been returning legitimately to study in Scottish secondary schools.
The trend began as a trickle of people in the early 1980s, and numbers
increased substantially between 1984 and 1987. The most recently
published Scottish Office figures show that about 12,000 adults were
studying in Scottish schools in session 1992-93.
The actual number of adults attending varies considerably across
Scotland and between schools. In Highland, the average number of adults
per school in 1992 was four, while in the Glasgow division of
Strathclyde the figure was 81. Most adults attend part-time, typically
for one day a week, and over 80% of these returners are women.
The most popular subjects are business studies, home economics,
creative subjects like art, music, and drama, and English. About 60% of
these older students take certificate courses, and so are mainly in S5
and S6 classes, though there are instances across Scotland of adults
studying in the early years of secondary school.
What is attracting adults to schools? Partly a general trend of
increasing participation in education and training by adults, in
response to a changing world, unemployment and new skill requirements in
jobs.
Schools are particularly attractive to many adults because they are
situated locally and attendance is convenient, fitting in with
commitments to school-age children, and because they offer a full range
of subjects.
Some schools have actively marketed their wares with adults in their
local communities, advertising in libraries, community centres, and
local newspapers. There are other important incentives -- courses are
usually free and many schools have received funding for creche
facilities.
Schools have generally welcomed adults, who tend to be highly
motivated and can often act as a calming influence on unruly pupils. And
for schools which, unlike Bearsden Academy, have suffered falling rolls,
adults have had important financial implications, paying for, in some
cases, between two and three teachers' jobs.
Not all adults have had quite such positive experiences in the
classroom. Returners typically have large gaps in their schooling and
schools are not geared to learning support for adults. Pupils and
younger teachers can be intimidated by articulate, life-hardened adults
in their midst. High drop-out rates and erratic attendance are other
aspects of the down side.
Recent research has also found that while adults in general experience
schools as welcoming and suppportive places to study, the personal and
vocational guidance system is aimed at children.
Most observers would agree that, on balance, the evidence points to a
successful development. All the more worrying, then, are recent reports
that reduced staffing budgets and cuts in Urban Aid grants which pay for
creche facilities have stemmed growth in this important area of adult
education, and in some areas the number of adults on school rolls is
falling.

Strathclyde.

A FORMER care worker and rave organiser who began taking drugs to help
him cope with the pressures of his job was jailed for 30 months
yesterday.
Christopher Dench, 26, admitted supplying ecstasy and cocaine at his
Stirling home in 1993 and 1994, and at Gatsby's nightclub in
Dunfermline.
Miss Susan O'Brien, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh
that police raided Dench's home in Wishart Drive, Stirling, in October
last year following the arrests of several people in a Stirling hotel.
Those arrested confirmed that Dench had supplied them with drugs and
when officers went to his house they found 165 ecstasy tablets worth
around #4000 in a coffee pot.
They also found a quantity of amphetamines and traces of cocaine.
Miss O'Brien said Dench organised raves as well as being a disc
jockey.
Miss Ruth Anderson, defence counsel, said Dench had worked long hours
as a care assistant with the mentally and physically handicapped and
took drugs to help him cope.
She explained that he was using drugs on a daily basis to keep him
awake by putting them in his coffee.
He had left his care job in September last year and become involved in
the entertainment business.
Miss Anderson told the court that Dench supplied ecstasy only to
people he knew.
She asked the court not to send Dench to jail but Lord Abernethy said
he would be failing in his public duty if he did not impose a custodial
sentence.

A DELIVERY driver who was in a coma for 45 days after a crash
involving an articulated lorry has lost his unfair dismissal case.
Mr Robert Bryson, of Cumbernauld, worked at the Cumbernauld depot of
Autobar Ltd, of High Wycombe, from April 1991 until he was sacked in
January this year. On January 19, 1994, he was involved in a serious
accident while driving for his employer and suffered head, chest, and
abdominal injuries, and total amnesia.
Mr Bryson's conditions of employment entitled him to full pay for 20
days but Autobar paid his wages for six or seven weeks. He was
discharged from hospital at the end of April 1994.
In August last year, he received a letter from Autobar's operations
manager which said that he would lose his job unless he returned to work
on August 29. When Mr Bryson, of Elliot House, Burns Road, Kildrum,
Cumbernauld, did not return to work he was dismissed and, when he
appealed against the decision, was reinstated. He finally returned to
work on January 9 this year.
Three or four days later, he was suspended on full pay, pending a
medical examination by Dr John Rankine. He was dismissed by the
operations manager after Dr Rankine's report declared that he was fit to
drive but said it was not advisable for him to lift or carry anything
heavy.
It was accepted that the work of Autobar drivers ''was physical and
generally strenuous'', with drivers having to do their own loading and
unloading.
The tribunal, in declaring the sacking was not unfair, found that the
operations manager ''was entitled to conclude that the applicant's
continued employment would put at risk his health. Accordingly,
dismissal was an option within a band of reasonable responses.''

As this year's
freshers get set
to start their
law courses,
the celebrated
Glasgow lawyer
Joe Beltrami
(right) speaks
frankly about
his 'overcrowded'
profession to
Geraldine
Abrahams.
FOR many first-year university students in Scotland, this is Freshers'
Week, when they will be given a taste of what they can expect over the
next three, four or more years.
Many of those students will study Law in the hope of practising in
that profession when they graduate. If they are lucky enough to find a
job -- and the majority still do -- those young hopefuls will find that
it has been influenced heavily by the political and socio-economic
changes of the past 15 years. The Law has become user-friendly or
unprofessional, depending on the viewpoint.
Joe Beltrami, probably Scotland's best known and most controversial
criminal lawyer, recently retired from full time practice and now acts
as a consultant with the firm he founded.
He has strong views on the direction his profession has taken, and his
opinions will give new students aiming for a future in criminal law some
food for thought. He does not mince his words.
''There are far too many lawyers qualifying at the various
universities in Scotland today and, that being the case, the slice of
the cake is getting smaller and smaller,'' he says.
''Thirty years ago, in the area of criminal law in Scotland, there
were only about 12 fairly prominent lawyers. Now you can count them in
hundreds. There appears to be a law practice on almost every street
corner.''
That increase in competition, fuelled in part by glamorous television
programmes like LA Law, has led to some very serious and undesirable
trends which Mr Beltrami says have already diminished the status and
position of criminal lawyers in Scotland.
''Because of the numbers graduating, and because of the difficulties
in obtaining business, there are lawyers who tout for business,'' he
explains. ''The struggle for clients is so great that nobody wants to
fall out with their clients, because there are another ten lawyers
waiting to take over the case.
The danger there is that the client sometimes begins to dictate his
defence to the lawyer and the lawyer, afraid of losing the client, can
be put in the position of having decisions taken by that client. This
should never happen. The lawyer is the one who should make decisions in
all cases, not the client.
In the past a lawyer's reputation was built on results, whereas Joe
Beltrami argues that, all too often today, new business is attracted by
a number of inducements offered, so that lawyers are tempted to hold on
to business to get new business. If reputation was built on results, it
was also built on respect, something he sees as lacking today.
''I hear clients in the cells screaming for lawyers by their Christian
names,'' he reflects. ''Not even my well-known client Arthur Thomson did
that. It was always on a 'Mr' basis, never Arthur or Joe. Clients had
respect for their lawyers.''
If the glut of lawyers in the legal marketplace is primarily
responsible for these changes, does that not suggest some
irresponsibility on the part of the various institutions throughout
Scotland that now offer increasing numbers of full-time and part-time
places on law courses?
''You can't criticise the universities for encouraging people for
wanting to learn and study, but I have always felt that the Law Society
should have done something about it. They should have taken the
appropriate steps years ago,'' he says. Mr Beltrami has also been
advocating other changes.
''Another problem is that because there are not enough jobs for
lawyers, they go out on their own before the ink on their certificates
is dry. I think that is very unhealthy, because they do not have the
basic background knowledge necessary for running a business,'' he says.
At least three years would make sense in Scotland, he says, although
he is sympathetic to the young lawyers who search for other options
because they cannot find jobs with established law firms.
Mr Beltrami's expressed opinions are critical of how the law is
practised today, not of the profession itself.
''There is no career I would have enjoyed more,'' he says. ''It is
exciting and a challenge. It involves a lot of hard work and
considerable strain over the years when you are representing people you
think are innocent. The more successful you are, the more the pressure
mounts, because you are doing the more serious cases.
''I would tell those going to study Law today to bear in mind that the
competition is great now, and there is a lot of hard work involved if
they are to do something with their lives. They will have to be on their
toes for the rest of their careers.
''They should have a retentive memory and an ability to cut themselves
off from other things and concentrate on the preparation of a case.
Preparation is the essence -- after all there is pride involved. And it
goes without saying that the appearance must be good.''
He stresses that Law in practice is not like it is portrayed on
television or in films, where the exciting, interesting and unusual
cases are highlighted. In reality, most of the cases in the sheriff
court are dull, and many lawyers deal with such cases all of the time.
''When I wrote my first book in 1980, all 16 cases were selected
because they were unusual. A fellow lawyer read the book, and going up
in the lift one day he asked me (jokingly) why I got all the publicity
instead of him. I replied that the public  would not be interested in
Two Cop Breaches,'' he says.
''It is difficult to enthuse in cases like that, but you must still be
on your toes. No matter how humble the case is, it must be seen as a
challenge. My first big civil case came from a very minor reset charge.
You don't start off doing the big cases, you have to start small and
when you do them well you build a reputation. That is certainly the way
it used to be.''

THE consortium of leading construction and corporate finance

in managing community projects on the eve of its launch.
Canmore Partnership will attempt to identify, develop, and operate
facilities traditionally provided by the public sector.
PFI, still in its infancy, was first mentioned in the Chancellor's
1992 autumn statement. It represents an initiative based on encouraging
the private sector to become involved in capital project work.
Active in both exploring potential projects and identifying strategic
partners, Canmore's objective is to respond to requests for tenders in
Scotland and elsewhere in the UK, for work primarily in the fields of
health, education, and leisure.
It planned to stay out of the political arena.
Behind Canmore is Glasgow-based MPM Adams, the country's largest firm
of construction project managers, and Noble &amp; Company, leading corporate
finance specialists and based in Edinburgh.
Mr Andrew Gordon, former Samuel Montagu merchant banker and director
of Health Care International, will be chief executive. He said there was
a need for private sector expertise in managing community projects to be
established in Britain, just as it had been in other countries.
Mr Tim Noble, Noble's chief executive, said: ''Canmore's strengths are
quite unique as it responds to requests to tender from those
administering the PFI initiative.''
He added: ''The aim is to see a number of operating companies
established to provide service to the community. If they can then expand
and offer their services elsewhere they will have done a double
service.''
Noble's chairman, Sir Iain Noble, is chairman of the Skye Bridge
Company, one of the first PFI examples in Scotland.
Mr David Adams, managing director of MPM Adams, said: ''We will offer
an effective bridge between the needs of the public sector and finance
and development resources of the private sector.
''In a field dominated by major contractors we believe our partnership
philosophy offers an attractive alternative to public-sector clients.''
Canmore expects to act as both a catalyst and nucleus in bringing
together financial, development, and operational expertise, as separate
ventures are launched.
Today's launch coincides with the opening of a two-day PFI conference
at Glasgow's Hilton Hotel, which will explore opportunities open to the
Scottish construction industry.

THE signing in Washington later this week of the agreement reached
between Israel and the Palestinians is, among other things, a reminder
of the umbilical link between the new accord and the ground-breaking
Oslo accord of 1993. This is useful because the entire Middle East peace
process has become so attenuated that it is useful to remind ourselves
that progress can, and will, be made. The judgment on just how much
progress is represented by the latest agreement depends on which side
you start from. Both the Palestinian side and the Israeli Government
have been subjected to substantial pressure in recent weeks to reach
agreement. Although the resulting accord is far from perfect there is no
doubt that it represents the beginning at least of a Palestinian state.
A recitation of the bare facts of the agreement, as made by Hamas, does
not look encouraging from a Palestinian point of view. It is true that a
large part of the West Bank, the bulk of its security and most of its
water resources will remain under Israeli control for the present, but
this does not represent a capitulation by Yasser Arafat, or anything
like it.
The first stage of the agreement will see an Israeli withdrawal from
six key cities. The imposition of Palestinian power in Jenin, Tulkarm,
Nablus, Qalqilya, Ramallah, and Bethlehem will give them control over
civil authority, public order, and internal security. That part of the
deal which leaves Jewish settlers, and Israeli soldiers to guard them,
in the centre of Hebron is unfortunate, but it is such a hotbed of anger
and prejudice on all sides that the status quo, for the moment, may be
wise. Without the deal on the cities Mr Arafat's gains would have looked
slender indeed, but they represent now the core of the emerging state
and an opportunity for him to demonstrate that he is capable of proper
administration. The Palestinian elections, which will probably be held
in April of next year, are long overdue and are an opportunity for the
Palestinians to elect an administration which will almost certainly be
dominated by the PLO and led by Mr Arafat. The elections will legitimise
Mr Arafat's power but will equally give the Palestinian people the
chance to impose democratic accountability on Mr Arafat. Given his
wilful behaviour in the past this will be a necessary and welcome
restriction; it will be interesting to see how he reacts.
Mr Rabin and the Israeli Labour Government have likewise suffered
under a barrage of criticism from predominantly right-wing Israelis who
have alleged that the new agreement compromises Israel's security. This
is probably not true. The wider issues of defence are unlikely to be
seriously affected by Palestinian control of the six cities and internal
security is such a difficult area that it can hardly have been worsened.
In the context of suicide bombers there is no such thing as 100%
security, and anybody who argues that it is achievable by territorial
control or any other device is a charlatan. Nevertheless Mr Rabin
clearly has political difficulties. He has skilfully crafted the
relevant part of the agreement to ensure that Israel will control much
of the rural area of the West Bank until well after the next Israeli
elections which take place in November 1996. Whether this will save him
electorally is quite a different matter. One thing is clear: the
potential for further dispute is large. It has been an achievement to
reach this stage of agreement but it will take real determination and
co-operation to go further.

THE Princess Royal escaped several soakings yesterday when she arrived
in Scotland to carry out the official opening of the country's largest
maze.
Under a threatening sky, the princess negotiated her way carefully
through Edinburgh Zoo's new leisure facility which incorporates along
its 642 metres of pathway six fountains capable of dousing those who
lose their way.
The new Darwin Maze, named after the naturalist Charles Darwin and
based on the theme of evolution, contains more than 1600 yew trees.
In the shape of a tortoise, one of the animals Darwin studied during a
visit to the Galapagos Islands, the maze is the central part of the
first phase of the Darwin Centre which has received more than #200,000
funding from a local enterprise company.
Professor Roger Wheater, director of the Royal Zoological Society of
Scotland, described the maze as ''a quality enterprise''.
Later, the princess visited the #23m Pentland Science Park at Bush
Estate, Midlothian, which is run by the Moredun Foundation of which she
is patron, and a Citizens Advice Bureau in Penicuik.

SO The Herald has got the get man. Today we publish Brian MacKinnon's
extraordinary story of deception which, we now conclusively know, he
embarked upon in a no-holds-barred effort to fulfil his lifelong
ambition to become a doctor. It was an ambition which his mother shared,
indeed actively encouraged. Brian MacKinnon acknowledges that his deceit
has cost him his chance, and instead of the medical career which he
craved, he has become, for a brief and inglorious period, the get man.
We are indebted to the London-based news bureau of the American ABC
television network for this transatlantic addition to the lexicon of
journalese. Such has been the pulling power of this story that the
network's London bureau chief spent two hours last week with his camera
crew at Bearsden Academy, finding out about the person who has become
the high-achieving, Glasgow leafy-suburb secondary school's most famous
-- or infamous -- pupil. After filming and interviewing had been
completed the bureau chief left the school's headteacher, Norman
MacLeod, his card in the hope that he would telephone the network first
if he discovered the whereabouts of the media's elusive prey. Brian
MacKinnon was, the TV journalist explained, the get man, the person
whose story every reporter wanted. It was, of course, a pious hope.
Norman MacLeod, a decent man, would not have told any journalist if his
exemplary former pupil had made contact with him.
Today we explain how we got the story. It did not involve any money
changing hands. The Herald's policy is not to pay for stories. And, over
the past couple of days, Brian MacKinnon has repeatedly emphasised that
he is not in it for the money. He does not want a penny from The Herald,
or anyone else for that matter. All he wants to do is set the record
straight, from his perspective. He admits that he returned to Bearsden
Academy under false pretences and repeated the ruse when he secured
entry to Dundee University. The university has all but said that his
duplicity makes it impossible for him to be trusted as a doctor. Brian
MacKinnon accepts that he cannot now practise medicine. But, as he sees
it -- and this appears to be the crux of the matter -- he was robbed of
that chance in the 1980s by Glasgow University. It is surely reasonable
to infer from his article in today's Herald that his exclusion from the
university's medical faculty, followed by his failure to gain the first
or upper second class honours degree in science which would have given
him a fighting chance of resuming his medical studies, have become
something of an obsession. The university believes it gave him every
chance in medicine but, based on his performance, had no option but to
take the course of action it did. For Brian MacKinnon, the university's
actions were extreme, and demanded an extreme reaction.
By a curious coincidence, the Demos think tank yesterday produced a
report which concluded that today's 18-to-34 year olds have more freedom
than any preceding generation to choose lifestyles. Brian MacKinnon is
living proof of that statement. By assuming a new identity, he took his
freedom of choice to unprecedented extremes. The dream of a medical
career would not go away but, in the end, his deceit caught up with him
and it has all faded away. Today he is left with nothing. Yet, in the
past couple of days, he has turned down offers of at least #25,000 for
his story. How many of us could honestly say we would do the same in the
same circumstances?

A MAN held as a suspect in the Naomi Smith murder investigation
yesterday threatened to sue Warwickshire Police for alleged wrongful
arrest.
Mr Darren Carter-Hounslow, 24, was released late on Saturday night. He
was arrested last week with four others who have all now been released.
One of the five was due before magistrates in Nuneaton this morning to
face unrelated charges of causing grievous bodily harm, serious sexual
assault, and three other assaults.
Mr Carter-Hounslow said he was ''suspect No 1''. He said: ''They asked
what did I feel like when I left Naomi gurgling in blood. They asked me
if I thought of my 16-year-old sister when I did it. It was sick.''
Mr Carter-Hounslow, from Ansley Common, near Nuneaton, telephoned
police on Monday last week after hearing rumours in the village he was
wanted for the killing.
He said he left his name and number. He said when he was arrested he
''felt faint''.
He said he knew Naomi but was not near the playground, known as The
Rec, when she was killed on September 14.
He added: ''I knew she had a bit of a crush on me because it was
written around the fences of The Rec and even under the slide..''

<HEADLINE>Documentary crew admits handing out Buckfast</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A TELEVISION crew admitted yesterday handing out bottles of Buckfast
wine to people taking part in a documentary.
But the crew director has insisted that no-one under 18 was given a
bottle.
Both the production company, Fuji International, and Channel 4 denied
they had handed out the tonic wine to engineer a drunken drama to
sensationalise filming.
The production team was in Airdrie filming for Channel 4's youth
programme, Passengers. The film, to be shown on Friday, October 20,
examines the phenomenon and popularity of Buckfast in the Monklands
area, which includes Airdrie and Coatbridge.
An Airdrie resident, Mrs Georgina McPherson, complained to Strathclyde
Police after her niece alleged she saw the film crew handing out bottles
to youngsters at ''The Gardens'', a local meeting spot for teenagers.
But yesterday Channel 4 hit back, saying that the director --
Glasgow-based Mr Brian Kelly -- had given a bottle to her son, Mr Chris
McPherson, 21, as thanks for taking part in the documentary.
Mr Barrie Hall, spokesman for Channel 4, said: ''The people filmed
were already drinking Buckfast when the director arrived. Word got
around that there was Buckfast in the production van, and some was given
to individuals by other members of the crew after they had asked for it.
''The director was certain no-one under 18 received any of the drink
from him or members of the crew.
''The film will be a balanced piece examining the phenomenon of the
popularity of Buckfast in Monklands, where it has been a popular drink
for generations. It examines the concern -- the 'moral panic' -- felt in
that community over the consumption of Buckfast, which goes as far as to
suggest the drink be banished.''
Mr Kelly said yesterday they had discussed ''Buckie mania'' with the
local police. So far he had been unable to speak to the Monklands East
Labour MP, Mrs Helen Liddell -- a vociferous campaigner against Buckfast
consumption.
Mr Kelly said: ''We did not engineer a situation for the sake of
filming. We had Buckfast available since that was the subject of our
film and, as far as I know, nobody under the age of 18 was given the
drink by us.''

CLASS sizes are back on the agenda and the clamour for more resources
for education has resumed. The question facing the Government is -- if
more funding becomes available, should it all necessarily go to the
school sector?
Education is compulsory between the ages of five and 16. That is where
the bulk of funds must go. Others fight their corner, and occasionally
enjoy a degree of success. In the non-statutory sector, the pre-five
lobby has campaigned hard over the years for new nursery provision, and
the Governement's new voucher scheme is the result. But what about the
rest?
''Lifelong learning'' is the in-phrase, but are we paying it more than
lip-service? The omens seem promising enough. New national targets have
been defined, and the Advisory Scottish Council on Education and
Training Targets (ASCETT) has been set up to oversee their
implementation. ASCETT is also anxious to promote a national learning
culture, with individuals having access to education and training
throughout their lives. It is a highly commendable initiative, but will
it work?
Over the last fifteen years, the staying-on rate at age 16 in Scotland
has doubled to almost 80%, and the proportion of those continuing into
higher education has nearly trebled to well over 30%. These developments
are very welcome, but we must do still better.
We belong to a global market where education and skills are the
currency. As Labour leader Tony Blair has admitted, people can no longer
expect to remain in one job for their entire careers. The need is for
core skills such as literacy, numeracy and problem-solving abilities,
leading to highly qualified, multi-skilled individuals who can apply
their qualities flexibly in different situations. Business and industry
need people who welcome change and are not overwhelmed by it.
Sir John Cassels, director of the National Commission on Education,
which has produced a blueprint for education in the United Kingdom over
the next twenty-five years, predicts massive changes in the labour
market. By the year 2000, professional and managerial employees will
outnumber blue collar workers by three million. The problem is that this
radical change will have to come about through a reskilling of the
existing workforce. ''We cannot rely on new entrants to provide the
skills which will be needed on such a vast scale,'' says Sir John.
He accepts that, even with its amateur tradition, Britain has always
been able to muddle through, but maintains that this time a more
concerted and professional approach will be needed to provide the
continuum of skills and knowledge required. The private and public
sectors are between them spending #16 billion a year on training, the
Investors in People scheme is catching on and modern apprenticeships are
gaining in popularity. However, there is still an enormous skills and
knowledge gap.
Like ASCETT, Sir John advocates: ''a learning culture in families, in
communities and in our society. We want to awaken a passion for learning
of all kinds.'' What is not there to take the learning culture forward
is a national financial support system.
For example, Sir John is disappointed that his proposal for five days
a year of paid educational leave for all employees has come to nothing.
He believes it has not been put into effect because of the fear that
employers would find a way round it. The same theme is taken up by Sir
Geoffrey Holland, former permanent secretary at the Department for
Education and now vice-chancellor at Exeter University. ''The great
majority of employers are small or medium-sized,'' he says, ''and wary
of investing in employees who may then simply leave for a job elsewhere.
In any case, personal development over a lifetime is something which
requires a commitment by the individual as well as the employer.''
Both of these distinguished educationists take the view that the only
way in which this mutual commitment can be achieved is through the
setting up of 'individual training accounts' which employees would have
the right to ask their employers to open.
''Both would contribute to it and it would accrue tax-free,'' Sir
Geoffrey explains. ''It would follow the individual, who would be the
only one able to authorise expenditure from it, to be used solely for
education or training leading to a recognised qualification.''
Such a development seems sure to be resisted by many employers, though
some -- such as Rover, Lucas and Ford -- have introduced imaginative
schemes of staff development which have raised levels of performance.
The public purse seems unlikely to be involved, because Sir John Cassels
and Sir Geoffrey Holland subscribe to the wide concern about funding
arrangements in the post-18 sector.
''At the moment many students are in poverty or near poverty,'' Sir
John claims, ''and the universities are being ground down year by year
on their unit of resource. This cannot go on without affecting the
quality of the system.''
Sir Geoffrey describes the financial support system as ''a terrible
mess''. If a young person gains a place at university, ''she or he
automatically gets an award to cover tuition fees, is eligible for a
maintenance grant and has access to the student loans scheme. But
part-time students get no such funding, and further education students
are at the mercy of local authority discretionary awards.''
The old story -- too few resources to go round. Higher public funding
-- with all its implications for levels of taxation -- may have to be
considered. ''Time is not on our side, socially or economically,'' says
Sir Geoffrey Holland. ''We need to get away from education concentrated
on the few to involving the many . . . from education as a once-for-all
stage in our early years to a lifelong activity.''
It is both a noble and a necessary vision, and few will take issue
with it in principle. Sadly, the powers that be, lacking the bottle if
not the vision, may expect us, in our best amateur tradition, to muddle
through yet again. It would, of course, be nice to be wrong.

They can't kill some of us so easily now. And I am here to fight for
equality and justice
Once the young firebrand of Northern Irish politics, Bernadette
McAliskey remains an outspoken champion of democracy, as James Young
discovers
BRITAIN has had its own Bosnia on its doorstep since the early 1920s.
And, as long ago as 1919 the Irish journalist James Winder Good argued
that ''Belfast's sudden relapses into savagery are a feature of its
record much more characteristic than its commercial progress''.
When the American historian J Dunsmore Clarkson published his book
Labour and Nationalism in Ireland in 1926, he said: ''Not only dead Jews
but live Jews are classed as Christians in Belfast, where they are
assigned to the category of 'papists', if they are in the trade union
movement, or to the category of 'prods', if they keep shop.'' But times
change, and so do people.
However, no-one can escape the sharp images of the murals and Union
Jacks as symbols of Protestant triumphalism in Belfast; and as I am
sitting on the bus just outside Sydenham, a few miles from the city
airport, the ultra-Protestants have pinched the words from the Arbroath
declaration of 1320 -- ''So long as 100 of us remain alive . . .''
However, it is better to steal words than to snuff out human lives.
Nevertheless, I was flabbergasted by the murals I saw calling for ''the
expulsion of the Irish'' from Belfast.
At the heart of establishment propaganda about the New World Order,
there has been an increasingly shrill insistence that racism and
militaristic ethnic nationalism are rooted in an irredeemably corrupt
human nature. As democratic consciousness appears to be marginalised
everywhere in the mid 1990s, I did not know what Bernadette McAliskey
would have to say for herself.
I met Bernadette in the Culturlann, a former Presbyterian church and
now an Irish language centre, in the Falls Road. She was sitting at a
table near the door, waiting for me. At once friendly and outgoing, we
chatted for a while before the formal interview began. With an
analytical brain like a new razor blade, I was very surprised by some of
her comments and judgments.
McAliskey is a unique figure on what remains of the socialist left:
committed, critical and active in the struggle against social injustice
and religious and racial discrimination. Asking her what she thought
about the prospects of the militant, democratic left in the immediate
future, she replied in one word: ''Bleak.'' Far from opting for
quietism, she is interested in struggling for practical things like mass
participation in a new democratic political structure, the ''minimum
wage'' and the defence of the National Health Service.
McAliskey is a socialist, an internationalist and a passionate
democrat. But although she does not apologise for the Catholicism or the
militancy of the Irish minority in the north of Ireland, she has
internalised the famous words of The Internationale that ''no saviours
from on high deliver, no trust have we in prince or peer''.
In ridiculing the idea that President Clinton is anything other than
the chief representative of the most imperialist country in the world,
she nevertheless emphasises that the only two unelected heads of state
in the contemporary world are ''the Queen of Britain and the Pope''.
McAliskey believes in elections and an effective democratic process.
Cheeky and irreverent, she remains an unrepentant radical. She has an
irrepressibly impish and childlike sense of humour. She speaks naturally
and honestly about her working-class upbringing: an upbringing marked by
material poverty and cultural richness. She speaks of her children of
whom she is obviously proud.
At 47, she still worries about being a good parent. And she insists
that ''happiness'' resides in ''struggle'' and in preserving one's
integrity. As she said in her autobiography The Price Of My Soul, her
principles are not for sale.
Clearly, she thinks for herself, and she is critical of the whole
intellectual and cultural heritage of Western socialism, especially in
relation to nationalism. As the formal interview began and she told me
that she was not allowed to sit her final examinations at Queen's
University, Belfast, in 1969 and so left without a degree, I kept
thinking that she could have been a superb university teacher.
Acknowledging that she has become even more of a left-wing socialist
and at the same time more nationalistic, McAliskey emphasises that she
is not against the ''peace process'' in Ulster, but as a democrat she is
opposed to the devious and anti-democratic means and mechanisms by which
''peace'' has been achieved.
Her criticisms of Gerry Adams and the Sinn Fein leadership are
motivated by her deep socialist convictions. Hostile to high politics
and secret negotiations, she believes that such tactics and behaviour
weaken the negotiating power of the nationalist community. But she is a
realist, too, and acknowledges that ''our people won't be able to go
back to armed struggle''.
Pessimistic about the possibility of the development of united action
between Protestant and Catholic workers for jobs and decent wages before
the British leave the North of Ireland, McAliskey attaches an inordinate
importance in the here and now to the struggle for ''the minimum wage''.
As we talked she was interrupted by a Gaelic-speaking teacher and
replied in Gaelic. Later on, when I asked if her fluency in the Irish
language was a recent development, she explained that she grew up
speaking English and Irish. Defending the cultural activity at
Culturlann and her own identity as an Irish Catholic, she said that she
never speaks Gaelic in the company of those who do not understand the
language. Having suffered for her own cultural identity, she is very
sensitive to the feelings of others in the Protestant community.
At the heart of McAliskey's thinking about the peace process is her
very sharp distinction between ''Hibernianism and republicanism''.
Standing in the tradition of James Connolly's socialist republicanism,
she is critical of what she sees as the desire for power on the part of
Arafat, Nelson Mandela and Gerry Adams. This appetite for power is seen
by her as ''a male thing''.
''Hibernianism is,'' she explains, ''the broad nationalist movement,
whose political ideology, whose social and economic cohesion, is towards
capitalism'' in the new independent state that she envisages in the not
too distant future. She is not a Hibernian, and she had no intention of
becoming part of a new ruling class. For her, the real goal of
republicanism is ''class equality''. But she knows that there is not
much space at the moment for old-fashioned democratic socialist
agitators like herself who speak up for ''working class rights and
dignity'', though she thinks this will change.
''My argument with the peace process is not with the ending of
violence,'' McAliskey insists, ''but with the Hibernians and republicans
who have weakened the traditional republican agenda. It was not a
socialist agenda, but it was an agenda about empowering and radicalising
the Irish working class and preparing it for new democratic
structures.''
Horrified by the secret negotiations that have gone on with various
sections of the establishment, including the hierarchy of the Catholic
Church, since the early 1970s, she quotes Mandela's discovery that the
white South African ruling class had ''a conscience''. When, she asked
with heavy sarcasm, did Gerry Adams discover that the British ruling
class had a conscience?
0 The whole set-up in the north remains anti-democratic and
repressive, she believes. This is where the ''violence'' comes from.
Whole electoral districts on both sides of the divide consist of 80% of
Catholic or Protestant voters. Emphasising that the immediate outlook is
bleak she says that ''nothing will really change until the British go!.
If we (the Catholic Irish) were black, they would be forced to describe
the situation here as one of 'apartheid'.''
Regretting the departure of Kevin MacNamarra as Labour's front-bench
spokesman on Nothern Ireland, she described him as ''a gentleman, one of
the Old School like Eric Heffer''. McAliskey dismisses what she calls
Tony Blair's ''arrogant ignorance'' about Ireland. The politicians she
respects are those who fight for their own principles and ideals.
And ''the gains'' after so much bloodshed and suffering? ''They can't
kill some of us so easily now. And I am here to fight for equality and
justice.'' Refusing to describe David Trimble as ultra-right or even
right-wing, she says the Ulster Unionist Party is the most democratic
political organisation in Ireland.
As a small gesture of reconciliation towards the Catholic minority,
the authorities at Queen's University ought to bestow an honorary
doctorate on this remarkably honest and courageous woman. The prospects
for democratic social change are indeed ''bleak'', but without those
champions of the underdogs like McAliskey we would already be living in
a post-1984 totalitarian nightmare.

SUNK deep in the easy-going, chatty pages of a Victorian novel lies a
plum item about modern newspaper work. It has to do with obituaries. For
this much proliferated part of the papers softer words were then used.
Sometimes in the book they are called biographies or else memoirs. But
they came out much the same a century ago as now. It felt that the
author, although d.l882, was reading over the shoulder.
Here is his core sentence.
''In these days (Anthony Trollope wrote) a man is nobody unless his
biography is kept so far posted up that it may be ready for the national
breakfast table on the morning after his demise.''
Trollope remarks that the instant writing-up of the life of a hero
must in some cases be difficult. Nevertheless, it is done. The only
pity, he indicates, is that the personage has to pop off before he can
read the puffs about himself. These are more my words than Trollope's.
His words come as a bizarre diversion a long, long way into his Doctor
Thorne yarn.
Trollope has a character in the tale a-dying in his bed and doing it
less than well. He demands attention. For much of every night he expects
his doctor to sit by him. Whenever the backs of his attendants are
turned, he is downing great glasses of brandy.
Although Sir Roger Scatcherd, for it is he, is not an old man, being
59, he has achieved much for his obituarists to get their teeth into.
Starting as a poor stonemason, he has left for monuments the many
canals, harbours, and jails he built.
Also a help to his biographer is how he has lingered on for four days
longer than expected. Whatever else, it improved his obituary. ''The
author had thus had more than the usual time for his work,'' Trollope
writes.
It meant that the ink was wet on his memoir before any tears for him
had dried.
Obituaries extend a reputation beyond life, but not much beyond. In
Doctor Thorne it is reckoned that they encouraged posterity to speak
audibly about the deceased for all of 24 hours.
One of the hazards of pre-packed appreciations is getting the right 24
hours. Several notables who were dusted off prematurely included Rudyard
Kipling. ''I have just read that I am dead,'' he wrote to a magazine
that had anticipated his demise. ''Don't forget to delete me from your
list of subscribers.'' Mark Twain famously erupted a cable to the effect
that reports of his death were exaggerated.
For a biographer in the business of producing what are sometimes
called last writes there is another hardship. Sometimes it feels that
writing inexorably about people in the past tense can hasten their ends.
Most subjects remain undistressed that their mortal coils are being
unwound ahead of time. Obituaries editors, a notoriously discreet bunch,
suggest as much.
From the hints they drop it seems likelier that their clients, who
include all of us, take to brooding about how they are going to be
remembered, or if. When their phones stop ringing, they take to calling
the obits page. Just to make sure the facts are right, of course.
They are worried that the newspapers, not usually long on memory, will
forget who they were in some war or what they did on this or that
quango.
Although obituaries have long been a basic allotment in newspapers,
their acreage has varied according to editorial mood. It has even been
asserted that they are the whole plot. G K Chesterton thought so. He
quoth: ''Journalism largely consists in saying 'Lord Jones Dead' to
people who never knew Lord Jones was alive.''
When Bette Davis was told of a rumour around Hollywood that she had
died, she responded that she would not consider it while there was a
newspaper strike on.
While some obituaries can be occasions of quiet pleasure, gross
veracity may not be expected to dwell among them. Some are to be read
like paper tombstones, which are about the only artefacts that stand
upright and lie on their faces at the same time.
Overprinted on any page of obituaries lies an unasked question. How is
it that a world which hath enjoyeth the work of so many good and clever
people can be in such a mess?
One whimsical solution has been to invite subjects to compose their
own last writes as members of some exclusive and learned associations
do. To this deadly game actor Lionel Barrymore contributed for his last
testament: ''I've played everything but the harp.''
Dramatist George Kaufman offered: ''Over my dead body,'' while Dorothy
Parker asked the living world to forgive her dust.
About the cruellestly neat of epitaphs was chiselled by Anonymous:
What I like about Clive
Is that he is no longer alive.
There is a great deal to be said
For being dead.
In an O. Henry story about the Wild West the baddest bad man in town
dies in the street. One by one his former neighbours gather around.
Looking down at him lying in the dust, they stand in silence. Nobody can
think what to say. From under their eyelids they urge each other to
utter one farewell thought that will allow them to get on with their
lives. At last, one of their number mutters: ''He had very good teeth.''

A MAN who disfigured a footballer by smashing a bottle or glass over
his head in an nightclub attack was given one last chance by a sheriff
yesterday.
Anthony Ritchie, 23, of Carlibar Drive, Barrhead, Renfrewshire, was
placed on two years' probation at Paisley Sheriff Court and ordered to
carry out 200 hours of community service for the assault on St Mirren
goalkeeper Alan Combe.
Sheriff Kevin Breslin warned him he would face jail if he committed
another assault.
Ritchie had admitted striking Mr Combe with a bottle or similar
instrument to his injury and permanent disfigurement in the town's
Institute nightspot last November.
The sheriff said he would not impose a custodial sentence, despite the
fact Ritchie had a previous conviction for serious assault, as defence
solicitor Robert Kerr had convinced him his client deserved a break.
The court heard how Ritchie lunged at Combe, 21, who had also been in
the Scotland Under-21 squad, as he and team mates enjoyed a night out,
welcoming a new player to the club.
Trouble erupted when Mr Combe, who was standing at the bar, felt that
Ritchie was pushing into him and thought he was trying to jump the
queue.
The footballer felt a violent blow near his right ear and slumped to
the floor after blacking out.
He was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, where he had twelve
stitches inserted in two wounds.
When cautioned and charged with the offence, the court heard that
Ritchie told police: ''He deserved it.''
Mr Kerr said that, during the row at the bar, one of Mr Combe's team
mates had apologised to his client, saying: ''Sorry, he's quite drunk.''
He said his client had sought advice from Renfrew Council of Alcohol
and counselling from his GP and was ''trying to make something of
himself'', having enrolled for a business studies college course.
The solicitor added: ''My client expresses genuine remorse and would
be more than happy to pay a compensation order.
Sheriff Breslin said, under normal circumstances, Ritchie would have
faced a custodial sentence but, after studying reports and listening to
what his lawyer had to say, he was prepared to give him a chance.

STUDENTS' representatives at a Scottish University are asking the
National Lottery Charities Board for funds to help alleviate financial
hardship among their numbers in what is understood to be an
unprecedented move.
Aberdeen University, where more than 25% of the 10,000-plus roll are
mature students, is reputed to suffer the most acute levels of poverty
among students of any UK university. Student leaders have blamed the
high cost of living in Europe's oil capital for this statistic.
A study conducted last year by the university's students'
representative council claimed that the average student was paying
almost #2000 a year in rent when the maximum grant was #2050. The
maximum grant has since been cut to #1820 and extra allowances afforded
to mature students have been withdrawn.
Taking into account other costs borne by students, including books and
travel, the majority of students at Aberdeen, says the survey, had debts
averaging #982 in the past year.
The AUSRC is hoping its application to the National Lottery Charities
Board, if successful, will help address the major problem of childcare,
which it claims is at present over-subscribed and too expensive.
The council is also hopeful of alleviating student poverty by setting
up a job-link scheme which aims to forge better links between local
employers and students. A legal advice centre on campus is also proposed
to give students access to free legal advice to address their poverty
problems.
The council's application comes three months after Aberdeen University
announced that its annual access fund of #220,000 was being augmented by
more than #500,000 a year in recognition of growing hardship among
students, although at the time universwity principal, Professor Maxwell
Irvine, admitted that it was still not enough.
The university is still seeking to raise more funds through its
quincentenary appeal. Professor Irvine said then: ''We are heavily
over-subscribed and I believe the situation will get worse.''
A Student Hardship Fund established by the university, understood to
be the first of its kind in the UK, has already received significant
contributions from the private sector.
Mr Ron Bird, president of the AUSRC, said yesterday: ''With Aberdeen
being the oil capital of Europe, it is virtually as expensive to live
here as it is in London, but we do not get a London weighting to help
offset the extra expense.
''Like many other universities we have students here who are well off.
But those who are experiencing poverty suffer more here because of the
economic situation which is peculiar to Aberdeen.''
Mr Bird added: ''Our application, if successful, would encourage
students to help find solutions to their own financial problems because
they will be involved at both planning and management level in all the
projects we have defined.''
The AUSRC expects to learn next month whether its application for
funding has been successful.

A NEW plan to protect the Cromarty Firth dolphins is being opposed by
Highland Regional Council because, it says, it will cost hundreds of
jobs and millions of pounds of investment.
The local authority says other councils throughout Scotland should
join its fight against proposals by the European Union to establish more
than 90 Special Areas of Conservation, or SACs, in Scotland under the
European Union's Habitats Directive.
It says that too much emphasis is now being placed on conservation to
the detriment of worthwhile job-creating initiatives.
The battle is being led by the council's convener, Mr Duncan
MacPherson, who is also a board member of conservation body Scottish
Natural Heritage.
SNH wants an area of the Moray Firth stretching from Lossiemouth to
Wick designated as an SAC because, it says, it is the habitat of the
rare bottlenose dolphin.
SNH is worried about the health of the dolphins, many of which are
suffering from an unidentified skin disease that experts believe is
caused by a cocktail of chemical pollution in the Cromarty Firth from
industrial and domestic waste dumped in the sea.
However, Highland Regional Council disputes that the dolphins live in
such a huge area and wants the economically important Cromarty Firth
excluded from the designation. The Cromarty Firth is already a Site of
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a national nature reserve.
The authority has successfully persuaded the Scottish Office to carry
out a study to determine exactly where the dolphin community lives
before the application is finally submitted to the EU.
Mr MacPherson said: ''If an area is designated under the Habitats
Directive it will have an inhibiting effect on inward investment,
particularly by foreign businesses. Highland has made protests already
and it is time other councils joined the fight.''
He emphasised the council wasn't opposed to the principle of the Moray
Firth getting additional protection, nor had it changed its opinion
about the dolphins.
Councillor MacPherson added: ''We recognise the international
importance of the dolphins and they do bring visitors to the area.
''However, local opinion is that the dolphins make relatively little
use of the waters of the Cromarty Firth.''
The convener, who recently led the successful fight to retain the Fort
William to London sleeper service, is worried that the flourishing
fortunes of the Easter Ross economy will be halted.
In the past 25 years, the area has seen the closure of the aluminium
smelter and the downturn in the oil industry, creating high unemployment
in Easter Ross.
Councillor MacPherson added: ''All the development agencies are
committed to promoting the development potential of the firth resulting
from the presence of deep water and sheltered anchorage in close
proximity to flat, developable land.''
He fears that potential investors will be steered away from the area
to other locations that are less constrained by nature conservation
designations.
Council planning director Richard Cameron is also concerned about the
move. He recently issued a report highlighting the growing economy and
falling unemployment in the area.
He said: ''Details of what restrictions will apply if this huge area
is designated an SAC are not yet clear but it appears as if it will
restrict industrial development in the Cromarty Firth.
''This could deter investment totalling millions of pounds in this
area and, if that happens, it may also mean the loss of current jobs as
well as preventing the creation of new ones.
''Much work has been done to promote Invergordon as a cruise ship port
of call. It has had a very successful year, including a visit by the
QE2, and next year more liners are booked to arrive. But if the area is
named an SAC it could have a significant effect on the local economy.''
Scottish Natural Heritage yesterday denied designation as an SAC would
restrict development.
A spokesman said: ''SACs are seen as an accolade and an opportunity to
promote the Highlands, not as a restriction on all development and
employment.
''Many of the proposed SACs already have significant economic activity
within them. This need not always change after designation and it is in
everybody's interest to maintain the high quality of the natural
environment that plays such a large part in the economic life of the
Highlands.
''The relatively high number of proposed SACs in the Highlands reflect
both the great international importance of its natural heritage and the
opportunities for its appropriate management and development.
''It is within the powers of the Secretary of State to accept, modify,
or withdraw any of the proposed SACs.''

RAIL fares could be cut by a third and major refurbishment projects,
including the modernisation of the West Coast main line, could proceed
if BR privatisation were scrapped, according to a report by a campaign
group.
Save Our Railways campaigners base their findings on the Commons
Transport Select Committee's assessment that privatistion will cost
between #500m and #700m a year.
The report, The Railway We Could Have, suggests these finances could
help reduce fares and that the cost of just over one year of rail
privatisation would pay for the automatic train protection (ATP) rail
experts have recommended following a spate of fatal accidents caused by
trains passing danger signals. ATP is shelved on grounds of cost.
In less than five years, the money saved could pay for four major rail
projects, including the west coast upgrading, plus a major resignalling
programme for much of the network.
Alternative uses listed include the upgrading and electrification of
the Glasgow-Edinburgh line (#89.6m), modernisation of the
Glasgow-Aberdeen route (#398.6m), and the Glasgow St Enoch's Link
(#20.7m).

THERE are several misconceptions in Diana Daly's letter about
Progression in Learning through Higher Still (September 12).
I do not as she suggests hark back to the good old days nor do I
consider pupils with brains -- regardless of their social or economic
background -- to be the privileged elite.
The assumption in her letter is that all pupils are of equal ability.
This is a foolish fantasy that any teacher can disprove with examples.
However, all pupils are of equal value and equal in human dignity. Those
with brains are no better and no worse than those with brawn.
We all have our own talents; the important thing is not to pretend we
are something else just because we want to be.
Diana Daly maintains that Scotvec is not an alternative but a
stepping-stone to Highers over two years. This contradicts all evidence
in the classroom. Apart from very few exceptions, Scotvec pupils will
not pass Highers even if they take them over 20 years.
All pupils need to succeed at their own level, so it is better for a
pupil to take Scotvec and succeed instead of being pushed by parents
into taking Highers and failing. But most parents still drag their
offspring backwards through a hedge of Highers.
Getting the system itself right is the priority says Diana Daly.
Agreed. But any system, like Scotvec, that relies totally on internal
assessment, is wide open to abuse.
I applaud her work as a parent involved with one of the task groups
but even a parent must know his/her limitations. How many parents would
question a doctor's or surgeon's diagnosis on their child, or a lawyer's
advice, an architect's assessment of a building's flaws, or a plumber's
analysis of blocked drains?
These are all professional people qualified to do their job. Yet a
teacher's assessment of a child's ability is invariably challenged with
the parent setting himself up as the expert.
Give teachers their fair due. Surprising as it may seem to some
parents, teachers do want the best for all children. The pursuit of
excellence at every level of ability is worth striving for, but it can't
be done without saying what we mean, and meaning what we say.

GEORGE Robertson and the Labour Party want to have it both ways. They
seem to think that they can say what they like about their political
opponents, but they scream with pretended outrage when they are told a
few home truths about themselves.
The Herald on September 25 provided a perfect illustration. Mr
Robertson's latest outburst was followed immediately by a letter from
another Labour MP, Norman Hogg, in which he described the SNP as
''unpleasant and dangerous''. He went on to reveal how little he knows
about the SNP which has always regarded as Scottish anyone who lives in
Scotland.
The SNP is a thoroughly democratic, patriotic, and fair-minded party
with a strong commitment to social justice. The frantic and dishonest
campaign of abuse by the Labour Party only proves, yet again, that they
have no rational answer to the overwhelming case for independence.

I have read Willy Newlands's article on the ruddy duck (September 9)
and wish to take issue with some of the remarks in it.
He states that my husband, the late Sir Peter Scott, made a fortune as
a bird painter. That is not true. My husband spent two-thirds of his
time working for his two charities, World Wildlife Fund and the Wildfowl
&amp; Wetlands Trust, and the other third earning our living. In no way
could it be said that he made a fortune (we lived comfortably but no
more).
With regard to the introduction to this country of the ruddy duck, my
husband and the WWT were primarily responsible for the escapes from
captivity of these birds but many other waterfowl breeders were equally
responsible.
It has to be said that unlike some of the other ''exotic'' waterfowl
now at large in this country, the ruddy duck does not compete with any
of our British ducks so that there was no cause for great concern until
they decided to emigrate to Spain.
If the WWT had not learned how to breed these stiff-tailed ducks in
captivity we should not have been so good at breeding the threatened
white-headed duck. We have therefore been able to provide essential
advice to the Spanish authorities which have used this information
successfully to reintroduce white-headed ducks in Spain.
Certainly my husband would have been distressed to know of the
problems that have arisen but I find the last lines, ''Lying rather
uneasily in his grave after all this fuss,'' particularly objectionable.

THE early-evening BBC Television news programme Reporting Scotland
broke the story last Monday night of Brandon Lee, the teenaged
fifth-year pupil at Bearsden Academy near Glasgow who was really a
32-year-old adult.
In common with other news-gathering organisations, The Herald
developed the story on the night and presented its readers with a fuller
version of the double life of Lee, or Brian Lachlan MacKinnon, on
Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday afternoon, Strathclyde region education officials explained
at a press conference their procedures for school admissions, and said
that they would be tightened up in light of the episode. The school's
head teacher, Norman MacLeod, spoke movingly about the man whom he
described as a model pupil.
But the subject of the story had gone to ground, and in the febrile
search for him and those who knew him well -- or thought they had known
him well -- it was open season on Brian MacKinnon.
Chequebooks were waved in an effort to entice former classmates into
giving interviews about MacKinnon. Money was also offered to anyone who
might know of his whereabouts. His disappearance gave the media a
licence to print the slightest rumour or unfounded piece of information
as fact, frequently sensational and inevitably ''exclusive''.
In the course of the week MacKinnon's closest friends became
increasingly indignant about the way they felt their former classmate
was being publicly annihilated in the tabloid press.
Although most had left school and were about to embark on higher
education, some of them went to see MacLeod on Thursday and told him
they wanted to set the record straight about the Brian MacKinnon they
knew. He advised them that The Herald would present their case fairly
and, on that basis, he telephoned the paper.
The Herald invited the group -- who had secured the approval of their
parents -- to the paper's offices, where they wrote a subjective,
extremely effective open letter to their friend. They finished with a
message which they addressed directly to him, pledging their continued
support and friendship.
After their piece, accompanied by a photograph of them, was published
on Friday, The Guardian asked for permission to reprint both on Saturday
morning. It was granted.
MacKinnon flew back from Germany on Saturday, and bought a Guardian in
London before returning to Glasgow on Saturday evening. He walked into a
circus when he arrived at Stirling Drive, Bearsden, and it went into
frenzy when word spread that he had returned home.
Offers of silly money for his story were posted through the letter box
with feverish regularity. It was think-of-a-sum-and-double-it time.
The Herald was among the many media organisations represented on the
doorstep and, like every other newspaper, TV, and radio station, was
getting nowhere with requests for an interview until a copy of Friday's
Herald with the article by MacKinnon's friends was dropped through the
letter box, along with a note explaining that we had arranged for his
friends to have their say in the newspaper, which had been followed up
by the Guardian -- as he had seen.
His mother has been a prisoner in her home since Monday last week and
it was the first he had seen of Friday's Herald.
The note offered MacKinnon the same opportunity which had been made to
his friends. If he wanted to put his case, The Herald would do it in a
fair way. The paper made it clear that there would be no payment for his
story.
The paper invited him to make contact if he wanted to take up the
offer. At 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon a man named Brian MacKinnon
telephoned the newsroom and asked to speak to the duty news editor.

AS A Glasgow medical student from the opposite end of the entrance
qualification spectrum, it is with interest that I have followed the
plight of Conor O'Reilly (September 20).
By now he is no doubt painfully aware that high school prizes, an
influential father, and the wherewithal to sue universities do not
guarantee admission to medical school.
Without wishing him any personal malice it is pleasantly ironic to see
someone with English A-levels be refused admission to a Scottish medical
school.
For too long this double standard has existed within the Scottish
private-school set who consider that the Higher is simply not good
enough a qualification to guarantee their progeny's birthright of
automatic admission to any university course.
I find his ignorance of Glasgow University's need for applicants to
''have made some personal effort to acquaint themselves with the way of
life a medical career offers'' quite unbelievable.
As the son of a doctor myself I realised this meant more than
following daddy around at work. The best ''research'' Mr O'Reilly could
engage upon in the coming year would be to ''get a life,'' and also to
acquaint himself with the realities of ordinary life in today's NHS --
some time as a hospital porter or auxiliary would provide a marvellous
insight.
Although we should beware a new tyranny of the ''good communicators'',
it is clear that high-flying research projects and straight As do not
the best doctors make.
We do need good clinical scientists but such individuals should still
demonstrate the required balance of academic and social skills.
Conor O'Reilly's courage in challenging the system is admirable but he
should remember that more potential doctors are knocked down at the
artificially high academic hurdle than at the social skills one, and
that these people have no legal recourse.
I wish him well in his new bid. If he succeeds I only hope that his
classmates, being medics, do not rib him too mercilessly as he is now a
marked man.

RUTH Wishart has done much to publicise the threat to liberal studies
in Scotland. What is now needed is a sustained campaign to prevent
Scottish adult education being dragged in the wake of its English
counterpart.
If there is a demand for accredited courses the demand has to be met
but not at the expense of the long-established courses in what might be
termed studying for pleasure or education-for-the-hell-of-it.
What is now taking place is not so much a response to a known demand
but the creation of a demand by restricting, perhaps in the course of
time abolishing, a long-established and proven educational provision.
I have been on the staff of Glasgow University's department of adult
and continuing education for 40 years. I have been involved not only in
these courses which once formed the total provision but in the more
recent access courses, of which I have enjoyed in equal measure.
I am conscious that my approach to the access course has been moulded
by experience within a department which has long catered for those who
wished simply to study for the pleasure of study.
My subject is art history and I advise my access students that the
course has two aims as they should have two objectives -- to get into
university and to learn how to enjoy paintings as they would enjoy a
poem, novel, or piece of music; the two not mutually exclusive and the
one as important as the other.
In accredited courses where everything has to be strictly measurable,
the enjoyment of works of art is all too likely to go to the wall.
This is relevant, if not to the whole, at least to a great part of
adult education. The abandonment of the traditional provision will not
only be a deprivation for those who simply want to study but will
impoverish the accredited courses by providing certificates but little
nourishment for the spirit.

DEAR me! I must have touched a very raw nerve in unionist Labour ranks
and maybe at the same time prodded a conscience or two, by referring to
those who willingly participate in a political system which keeps
Scotland in a political strait-jacket as tartan Uncle Toms and tartan
traitors.
George Robertson, the unionist Labour MP for Hamilton, asks Alex
Salmond if he approves of these words and sentiments and asks him to
make it clear if they are personally unacceptable and if they will be
outlawed by him.
The SNP has had to live for decades with taunts from unionist Labour
as being nazis, fascists, extremists, separatists, tartan Tories, kilted
communists and lots more, insult piled upon insult -- none of it is true
and no apology and no outlawing ever forthcoming.
I challenge George Robertson to issue an immediate instruction to all
his unionist MPs, councillors, and activists to unreservedly apologise
for the use of such language directed against SNP activists whose only
purpose is to return political independence to our land -- to bring back
normality to Scotland, to give us equal status with other nations in the
European Community, and to again participate with the nations of the
world.
As to the accusations made by me, about those who put the interests of
another nation before their own, there will be no apology -- if the shoe
fits.

IT IS not surprising that the Government by introducing the National
Lottery felt qualified to do so in consequence of its fixation with
numbers.
The stubborn adherence to limiting the number of Hong Kong British
passport holders to 50,000 supports the charge of Perfidious Albion.
Portugal has provided passports, without quota, to those in Macao
wishing to reside in Portugal, which means that the people of Macao can
pass freely within the European Union and, if of a mind, could settle in
the UK without let or hindrance.
That we can stand aside and refuse entry to Hong Kong British passport
holders is shameful and a dereliction of a moral duty to those loyal and
industrious people.
Understandably, many of them fear oppressive Chinese rule, but the UK
would have no cause to fear and indeed would be the beneficiaries of
their own proven worth in displaying good old-fashioned energy and sense
of community and family values.
I submit they would not prove a burden to the State. They would be
exemplary models of citizenship. In any event, by possessing British
passports, it is their right to be allowed entry and to be prevented
from doing so makes a mockery of these hitherto cherished documents.
Of course not all of the three million could, for various reasons,
come here but, if we have any decency left, we should remove the
barriers at once and support Governor Patten who has, belatedly, given
voice to what many fair-minded UK citizens have long thought as June
1997 draws uncomfortably close.
It is to be earnestly hoped the imminent Conservative conference will
support their former enlightend chairman and confound the Home Secretary
and his right-wing flag-aving Little Englanders.
If not, we should be spared for everymore the singing of ''Britons,
never, never, never shall be slaves,'' the prospect feared to be the lot
of those millions in Hong Kong who have served the Crown with unswerving
loyalty, enterprise, and with diligence.

A RENOWNED heart surgeon whose colleagues refused to work with him was
yesterday offered early retirement. But Mr Duncan Walker, who has been
dogged by controversy since he prompted an investigation of another
doctor for bribery, turned down the offer from the United Leeds Teaching
Hospital Trusts.
Uddingston-born Mr Walker, a leading paediatric heart surgeon, told
BBC Radio Leeds it was an ''insult''.
The retirement offer followed a review of Mr Walker's clinical work at
Killingbeck Hospital by the trust's board. ''Doubts'' had been expressed
by Mr Walker's colleagues about his techniques.
Mr Walker caused an investigation in January into allegations that
another heart surgeon had been offered a bribe to move an NHS patient to
the front of a surgery queue.
After the police and hospital cleared the doctor, Mr Walker's
colleagues held a meeting and concluded that he ''did not have a future
role as a cardiac surgeon'' in the unit.
The trust board claimed the offer had nothing to do with problems
following the bribery allegation, and was based purely on a review of
clinical work.
A spokesman said: ''As far as we are concerned, the offer is not
connected with that. This was a review of Mr Walker's clinical work.''
Mr Walker won the title of Yorkshireman of the Year in 1990 for his
role in raising more than #1.5m for the Killingbeck Children's Heart
Surgery Fund.
After a long period off sick he is back at work, although he is not
permitted to carry out surgical procedures.
He told Radio Leeds: ''My initial response to the offer was just 'get
stuffed', but I have to talk to my legal advisers and then we'll come
back with perhaps a stronger response.
''I am 53 years of age and I have spent 33 years as a heart surgeon.
It would be an incredible waste of public money to discard me. I have
lots to offer the NHS.''
Mr Walker said later: ''The trust has never made any specific
allegations that I can reply to. I am simply a fall guy. I've stirred up
a real can of worms and I'm being invited to take early retirement so
they can forget about it all.
''Their claim that this is based on a clinical review is rubbish. If
my conduct was all that worrisome why did they keep referring patients
to me?
''It is now some time since it all happened and I was hoping they'd be
sensible and ask me to go back to work properly.''
Mr Walker, who lives in Headingley, Leeds, said relations with some of
his colleagues were excellent, but with others they were ''poisoned''.
He said the trust had asked him to reply to its offer within 24 hours,
but he stressed: ''I will speak to my legal and medical advisers and we
will reply in our own good time.
''It is highly unlikely that I will be taking up their offer.''

As businesses in the North of England watch their precious water
supplies dwindle, George Hume reports that Scotland's most abundant
natural resource could become a jobs winner
ATTEMPTS by Yorkshire Water to reduce the number of its industrial
consumers to a level the company's shrinking reservoirs can cope with
could turn into a flood of jobs for Scotland.
Suddenly water has taken on a high profile -- with guaranteed
continuous supply in strong demand.
The invitation from Yorkshire Water to firms in its area to use less
water or ship out has left industrialists there, particularly those who
operate 24-hour process sytems, angered by the risk of empty water tanks
and dry pipes.
Scotland's superabundance of water is already a proven best-seller
when it comes to wooing major industrial developments -- a #200m
investment by Caledonian Paper at Irvine that produced 400 jobs required
a daily supply of three million gallons: likewise the setting up of a
plant at Dalry by Roche Chemicals was dependent on a constant supply.
Krystyna Robinson, Edinburgh district's director of economic
development, was yesterday gearing up to take advantage of Yorkshire
Water's cavalier attitude to local job prospects, pointing out that in
Lothian and Strathclyde a constant supply of high quality water can be
guaranteed.
''Water so far has been taken for granted, but now Yorkshire Water
have shown that is not the case. For industry, a guaranteed supply is of
major importance. The check-list that incoming companies produce usually
begins with labour, available skills, road and rail communications and
goes on through electricity and gas supplies down to water -- always at
the bottom of the list,'' says Krystyna Robinson.
''But now water has to be up near the top of the list because it is of
prime importance. What Edinburgh and Lothian can offer any industry that
wants to set up here is an uninterrupted supply of top quality water and
we will be promoting that along with all the other aspects that make
this such a good place to set up in business.''
The trend to seven-day, 24-hour working in many industries makes a
guaranteed supply particularly important, says Robinson.
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise -- LEEL -- has helped attract 23
companies to Lothian in the past year, creating 1660 jobs. But according
to Paul Lewis, LEEL's international business manager, until now ''no-one
has ever asked about water''.
Yorkshire Water's ''use less or go'' ultimatum to industries he
describes as ''sheer stupidity'', adding: ''A guaranteed supply to
customers is something you neglect at your peril, as Yorkshire Water has
found out.
''Water, so far, has not been a key factor in locating in Lothian, to
some extent because we do not go for really heavy industries. But
precision engineering and firms making semi-conductors and printed
circuit boards all rely on a good supply of water and they get it
here.''
David Campbell, of Strathclyde Business Development, describes
Yorkshire Water's approach to maintaining jobs in its area as ''highly
unusual''. He cites Strathclyde's success in attracting water-demanding
industries and does not neglect a more traditional use of water in
Scotland.
''We have the water for all types of industry -- most recently a new
distillery at Arran -- and there can be no doubt that a constant supply
of water is what many businesses need,'' he says.
A recent Scottish Office report on water resources states that
long-term rainfall statistics tend to indicate that in an average year
the overall resource outstrips the demand for supply a hundredfold.
In terms of available run-off, just 1.1% is taken for public water
supply in Scotland. In England and Wales that figure stands at 9%, and
according to research carried out last year by the National Rivers
Authority the current surplus of public water supply resources in
England and Wales could turn into a deficit.''
The jobs market in Yorkshire may yet dry up if Yorkshire Water
persists with its plan to rid itself of customers who need water in
large quantities. North Yorkshire County Council reports unemployment in
its area at 5.6% while in Lothian the figure stands at 7.5% and in
Strathclyde 9.5% -- workers as well as water for any industry seeking to
come to Scotland.

As a proud mother comes to terms with the havoc that has invaded her
everyday life, ELIZABETH BUIE explains how faith helps to triumph in the
battle against adversity
A WEEK past on Monday, Mrs May MacKinnon came home proud of the fact
that, despite her arthritic spine, she had managed to do her shopping.
Then she switched on the television, sat down, and put her feet up --
only to catch the news. What she heard was to wreak the most awful havoc
in what had been a relatively tranquil, if not trouble-free, retirement.
On screen, she saw the tale of her son's deception unfold amid false
allegations that he had had two passports and been involved in a
bar-room brawl while on holiday.
Since then, her life has not been her own. She has been unable to
leave her home, unable to buy a pint of milk, a loaf of bread, or a tin
of soup, for fear of being accosted by journalists parked outside her
door -- hell for anyone, but particularly painful for a woman who cannot
bear to spend a day without going out for a walk at some point.
After a week of virtually no sleep, constant stress, and mounting
anger at the lies that have been told about her son, she is exhausted,
but amazingly lucid about the whole affair. She is too tired to speak of
her ordeal.
This, therefore, is simply an attempt to portray the indomitable
spirit behind Brian MacKinnon.
She seems to regard the media circus that has dominated her past week
almost with incredulity. What would her life have been like if her son
had killed someone? How much worse could it have been? But in some
respects, a murderer's family would have more legal protection than
someone whose son simply embarked on an ill-conceived masquerade.
May MacKinnon suffers from blood pressure, and feared at one point
that she was going to have a stroke. But this is a woman of great moral
strength.
She found out, after a phone call from Bearsden Academy, that Brian
had lied about his name and age. But throughout his year from 1993-94 at
Bearsden, she believed he had returned as a mature student -- a practice
not uncommon these days in schools that welcome adult-returners. When
she says she never knew he used an alias, you know this is true.
Mrs MacKinnon is a woman of strong convictions, and you can sense her
dismay that her son should have lied. But he never committed any crime,
defrauded no-one, and has nothing to hide, she believes.
This is a woman brought up in a strong churchgoing tradition. Now and
then she will cite a Biblical saying of her father's, a staunch member
of the Church of Scotland. It would be understandable if her own faith
had been shattered by the predicament in which she now finds herself --
her home under siege, offers and entreaties pouring in by the hour. But,
somehow, she can still say that there is good in the worst of us and bad
in the best of us.
And if her son lied about his identity, she can forgive him that for
the support and care he showed when his father was dying at home from
cancer of the oesophagus.
The medical profession is not held in high esteem by Mrs MacKinnon, a
retired midwifery sister of 44 years' experience. She has seen good and
bad doctors at work, but nurses a deep-felt anger at the doctor who
allegedly misdiagnosed her husband's cancer.
Even greater is her anger at the way that Glasgow University's medical
department treated her son while he was pursuing the initial years of
his medical course.
She believes in retrospect that he suffered from a combination of a
coxsackie virus and ME. Had he been felled by these illnesses 10 years
later, when medical authorities knew more about them, she is sure he
would have received more understanding and sympathy.
For there can be little doubt that Brian MacKinnon's illness and
subsequent departure from Glasgow University's medical school were
crucial to his decision to embark on the road of deception.
His mother clearly sees him as a caring, gentle man -- a man who
would, had be become a doctor, have treated his patients with great
humanity, talked to them compassionately, and shown them great care.
The two are friends, who, even in the most trying of circumstances,
show a deep love for each other. Mrs MacKinnon had been married 12 years
before she had Brian, 15 before she had his sister. Who knows if it is
because he was her first-born, or because there is truth in the saying
that mothers are closer to their sons, and fathers to their daughters,
but there is a special bond between these two.
Who knows what the future holds for this indomitable woman who, at 70,
probably thought she was entering a gentler phase in a life that has
been full of hard work, tough knocks, not a lot of money, but a good
share of family happiness and laughter.
There is not much laughter in that household now, with every curtain
drawn against the photographers' long lenses. Surely Mrs MacKinnon must
be longing for the time when she can sleep peacefully through the night,
and go out shopping, free from strangers' attention -- just as she was
able to do eight days ago.

THE actor, author, and comedian Stephen Fry has broken his
self-imposed public silence to give an exclusive interview to The
Herald.
Fry has given no interviews since he walked out of the West End play
Cell Mates in February, reportedly bruised by bad reviews.
His lawyers have since said he was too ill to perform in the play
because he had suffered a breakdown.
He made his first public appearance in five months at Dundee
University in July, when he received an honorary degree in recognition
of his work on behalf of students at the university.
Fry was re-elected rector of Dundee University for a second term
earlier this year and, in that capacity, he agreed to tell The Herald
about his role and responsibilities, and about his concerns about
student hardship.
It was also apparent he had lost none of the humour or charm which
characterised his public persona. Asked if he found the rector's largely
ceremonial role off-putting, he replied: ''An old queen like me? I revel
in ceremony.''
Asked for his priorities as rector, he said: ''I tend to come up by
sleeper from London and return on the evening train. Once, just once, I
would like to see if I could be put back on the train sober.''
He said his real priority was to ensure that the quality of student
life in Dundee was as high as anywhere else in Britain. There were
enough good people at the university ''to save students from the
despair, fear, loneliness, and worry which can often accompany academic
life''.
But, he said, it was hard for students to get by without jobs during
term time, let alone during their holidays.
Fry talked about his initial opposition to the Government's student
loans scheme. ''It seemed to me to be a mean-spirited, short-sighted,
ill-conceived idea, at odds with what I assumed was a consensus on the
part of the nation that their young should be educated at the willing
expense of us all.''
However, given that the scheme appeared to be the only way the country
could currently afford to have its students, ''it has to be faced that
student loans are better than nothing''.
Asked why he had agreed to assume the added burden of being rector for
a second time when he already had many other commitments, Fry said: ''I
suppose the more different things one can do, the more fun one will
have.
''One of the pleasing aspects about the 'celebrity' thing is that one
does get asked to do things that otherwise would never come one's way.''
Following his sudden departure from Cell Mates -- after three
performances of the play -- Fry went to the south of France then entered
a London clinic for psychiatric treatment.
He is being sued by the producers of Cell Mates for breach of
contract. They are claiming #500,000 in damages for the collapse of the
production after his departure. Fry recently undertook an unscheduled
solo tour of Belgium and has been seen at social occasions in London.
The full interview with Fry appears in Student Herald, which is
published today with The Herald.

IT IS quite wrong for Treasury Minister Angela Knight to assert that
it is due to more people being in work now, as compared with at the time
of the last General Election, that more people are paying income tax
(September 23).
On the contrary, the Government's own figures show that since the
election in 1992 the number of people in employment has actually fallen
by 1.6%.
This year a record number of taxpayers are paying the cost of the
Government's mismanagement of the economy. Typical families are hit with
demands of #800 more in tax, on average, since the last election.
It is therefore wrong, too for Mrs Knight to claim that households are
better off this year.

AS AN angler and regular loch user I feel that Mr McQuillan is
fortunate indeed to have sailed Loch Lomond for a season and failed to
witness chaos or a wave of acrimony (September 16).
My own experiences tell me that James Freeman's article was accurate
and described the frustrations felt by all responsible loch users, not
just anglers.
James Freeman's views on irresponsible behaviour were supported at a
recent seminar by John McFall, MP, and Councillor Duncan Mills who both
related personal experiences of bad behaviour and emphasised the need
for some form of control on the loch.
Sheriff-Principal Hay, at a recent fatal accident inquiry, also
highlighted the need for controls following the unfortunate death of a
young woman in a boating collision.
Are these people wrong as well?
Mr McQuillan claimed that anglers were responsible for ''malicious and
dangerous behaviour on the loch.'' What does that sentence convey? It
tells us nothing.

Smokers obviously do not equate throwing cigarette ends away with
littering.
In the interests of the environment, our health, and the costs of
water purification, I propose a ban on smoking in this area, enforced by
law and a penalty.
If the Hawaiians can do it for their corals, why can't we do it for
ourselves?

THE back page of The Herald was dedicated to the redevelopment of
Leith spearheaded apparently almost single-handed by Ian Ruthven
(September 18).
I believe that he might have been assisted somewhat by the #1m to #2m
pumped annually into the town by the Scottish Development Agency,
Scottish Homes, and the district and regional councils via the Leith
Project.
Your photograph says it all. At the start of the Leith Project of the
eight buildings in the picture three were completely derelict, three
were partially derelict, and one was a gap site. All were restored with
assistance from the Leith Project.
There was a lot of talk at the time about the yuppification of Leith
because of the improvements carried out by the Leith Project, but as a
general rule the yuppies tended to move into the previously empty
warehouses rather than displace the locals from the delights of the Fort
and the Banana block.

<HEADLINE>McLeish warns of hidden clauses that could leave more northern routes at risk. 'No guarantee' for Highland lines</HEADLINE>

PRIVATISATION could kill off rail services from Inverness to Wick,
Thurso, and Kyle of Lochalsh, Labour's Shadow Transport Minister, Mr
Henry McLeish, warned yesterday.
Mr McLeish said in Inverness that campaigners who had won a reprieve
for the West Highland sleeper would need to keep the fight going to
ensure the future of these other lines.
''Currently, nearly #2000m is being given by the Government to the
director of rail franchising for socially obligated railways,'' he said.
''It is crucial in the rural areas not only to retain the railways but
to get some of this cash to retain them.
''It is the franchise director, Roger Salmon, who now has total
responsibility for that #2000m -- not the Government, not Parliament,
not any involvement with the public. So clearly his decisions matter.
''It is true that these northern services are in the Passenger Service
Requirement but while the PSR is supposed to be a legally contractual
document between the franchise operator and the director of franchising,
tucked away are clauses which allow for any of these services to be
changed.
''They are in the PSR and hopefully they will continue but there is
absolutely no guarantee for any route in the country.
''If, for example, ScotRail falls prey to Stagecoach, which has a
large chunk of the bus operation in the Highlands, what chance for rural
rail routes which would be competing against their bus services? That is
why we are fighting hard to ensure that companies like Stagecoach are
not allowed to win important franchises like Scotrail.''
The Herald contacted the Perth-based company yesterday but nobody was
available to comment on Mr McLeish's remarks.
Mr McLeish was in Inverness to endorse the Labour candidate for the
Inverness East, Nairn, and Lochaber seat, Mr David Stewart. This is the
third time Mr Stewart, a 39-year-old social work team manager who is
also a councillor on Inverness District Council, will have fought the
Inverness seat. He came a close second, within 488 votes of Sir Russell
Johnston, in 1992, but at that election the seat became a four-way
marginal with only 1800 votes dividing Liberal Democrat, Labour, SNP,
and Conservative.
Mr McLeish said he was certain that Mr Stewart would take it this
time. ''That is very important because this is a battle-ground seat. It
is in the front line against Labour's enemies.''
Both men agreed that one of the issues Labour should campaign on was
high motoring prices. A recent study by an economics lecturer at
Inverness College, Mr Derek Louden, had found that drivers in rural
areas of the Highlands and islands were paying at least #12m, or #120 a
head a year, more than their urban counterparts. That was based on an
eight pence/litre differential but, on some of the smaller islands,
drivers can pay 20p more.
Mr Stewart was one of the councillors who attended a meeting in
Inverness last week when the Highlands and island councils launched a
joint campaign on the issue.
He agreed with Mr McLeish to launch a ''fuel watch'' campaign in the
Highlands, which Mr McLeish said had been run successfully in Fife.
Mr McLeish suggested a meeting with the oil companies. ''They deserve
to be embarrassed. People are trying to make their living in the petrol
stations but it is not the managers' fault, it is not the local owners'
fault, it is directly the responsibility of the oil companies and I
think we should take it right to their doorsteps.''

WHEN the Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, suggested on BBC Radio
Four over the weekend that 3.3 million Chinese living in the colony
should be given the right of abode in the United Kingdom, it sent a
shock wave through the country and led to an immediate backlash.
Even members of his own Conservative Party spoke out angrily against
the idea.
Any move to change existing legislation, which was passed five years
ago, to allow such a mass migration was quickly quashed by Home
Secretary Michael Howard who said there is no question that Britain will
open its doors to the people of Hong Kong.
Under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990, 50,000 heads of
household have the right to a full British passport in a scheme brought
in after the Tiananmen Square massacre, in a move designed to calm fears
in the colony.
There are a number of other forms of acquiring British citizenship,
including the Sensitive Service Class, which allows the Governor to
recommend up to 6300 people to apply to him for ''special
consideration''. Most of those covered by this scheme are civil
servants, including former members of Special Branch's China-watching
section which disbanded earlier this year.
But what Mr Patten and a large number of the Hong Kong residents know,
is that even if they were awarded British nationality the vast majority
of them would not leave the colony because of the poor business
opportunities overseas.
If they did accept it there is a good chance that they would either
relinquish it or use the passport to go to a third country, preferably,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand or America.
What they really want is security, an ''insurance policy'' for the
future in case of post-handover problems following China's resumption of
sovereignty on July 1, 1997.
''I would definitely not consider settling in the UK,'' said Hong Kong
resident Rosa Chan after Patten's comments on the BBC's Any Questions
programme at Government House last Friday.
''We had qualified to settle earlier but we rejected the offer. We
plan to stay in Hong Kong.''
Others are worried about starting all over again in a country they
know little about.
''The UK economy is bad and there is racial discrimination,'' said
34-year-old Ms Chan Cheuk-kuen. ''I have brothers who were granted right
of abode previously but they all turned the offer down.''
However, there is a group of 29 Chinese and Eurasian war widows and
wives of ex-servicemen who have been campaigning for more than a decade
without success to obtain British passports. Last year they won a small
victory when they were allowed entry rights to the UK but they are still
pushing for full citizenship which they state they earned through the
husbands' sufferings in the ''service of the Crown''.
In a move aimed at easing fears of those who have obtained foreign
passports, China earlier this year said no action would be taken against
Hong Kong residents who migrated overseas but who returned to the colony
before 1997.
An increasing number are doing just that after becoming bored with
life away from their families, fed up with cold winters, strange customs
and poor economies.
But this hasn't stopped thousands of other residents from joining the
queues to get a passport out of Hong Kong. A study conducted by a
research bureau in Australia's Department of Immigration and Ethnic
Affairs found that Hong Kong-born people are emigrating to the country
at a faster rate than ever, making it second only to Britain as a
''source'' state.
The report, released earlier this year, claims that from 1985-91 a
total of 278,000 people emigrated from Hong Kong to Canada, the US and
Australia, with 27% of them moving to Australia. In that period the
number of people born in the colony living in Australia doubled to about
58,000.
''While previously Australia's image to potential immigrants from Hong
Kong may have been tainted by the exclusionary policy of the past, the
attractiveness of Australia as a destination has increased rapidly since
the mid-1980s,'' it states.
''The appeal of Australia as a land of opportunity remains potent,
nurtured by the legendary success of some of the early Chinese
immigrants who later returned to set up modern department stores in Hong
Kong.''
The other main destination country is Canada which allowed 43,453 Hong
Kong residents to migrate there last year, with most of those going to
Toronto and Vancouver which have thriving Chinatowns.
The first 70 settlers from the Pearl River Delta -- Hong Kong is on
its eastern entrance -- arrived in Canada in 1780. Since then the number
of ethnic Chinese in the country has reached about 800,000 out of a
total population of 30 million, with Chinese being the third most spoken
language after English and French.

While the Hong Kong Chinese find a welcome in America, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and other countries, Margaret Vaughan wonders
what it is the rest of the world knows that we don't
FIENDISHLY difficult matter, this business of foreigners. Tricky one
for politicians at the best of times, what? Home Secretary Michael
Howard slaps down a suggestion from Chris Patten that the Government
should grant rights of residence to 3.3 million Hong Kong people.
''There is no question of that,'' he snaps, reminding us that in a
previous incarnation Mr Patten was a senior Minister in the Cabinet that
decided in 1990 to limit the rights of citizenship of the UK to 50,000
heads of Hong Kong families fleeing the colony, ahead of Chinese rule in
1997.
''What's he up to?'' his erstwhile colleagues flap. And why should he
bother urging such a course of action when it's patently clear that
Blighty is not quite the shining beacon of opportunity to which the Hong
Kong Chinese are turning a longing face? As it turns out, even those
gilded few offered full British passports are not rushing for our
straitened shores.
Still, Mr Howard was taking no chances. Quite right too, splutters
Spelthorne's Tory member David Wilshire, who in the manner of a
Corporation clippie hanging from the platform telling us the bus is
overloaded, says: ''My constituents believe that this country is full
up.''
But hang on! There must be some room upstairs. For only last October
it was announced that a review of the rules would allow some new
migrants to negotiate the obstacle course of UK immigration laws. Just
so long as they can leap the financial hurdle of owning at least
#750,000 to be invested in Government stocks and shares.
No sooner had Mr Howard sat down hard on Mr Patten's proposals than
his Shadow, Mr Jack Shaw, popped up. Would New Labour, then, be more
convinced by the idea of allowing British rights of residence to those
industrious souls who feared heavy-handed communist rule, when Old
Labour hadn't? No! Mr Shaw confined himself to taunting the Home
Secretary with an invitation to clarify exactly what constitutes Tory
policy on immigration.
It is a good question with no good answer.
Consider Michael Portillo's fight, in March of this year, against a
directive about the rights of EU workers toiling in other countries. He
said it infringed free movement of labour and would mean ''putting up
the shutters at national frontiers''. Yet, at the same time, the UK
opposed the opening of Schengenland -- the borderless space symbolising
free movement across European borders for European citizens.
As Mr Portillo rightly acknowledged, the Brussels directive would have
stopped our people going abroad to earn money. But we are against
Schengen because we don't want other people flooding in. Here then is a
curious thing: we are, it seems, poor enough to need to export workers
to richer neighbours yet so attractive that we fear being ''swamped'' by
abandoning border-controls with the rest of the EU.
In truth, Britain has less of a foreigner problem than the politicians
pretend. This is in part because Britain already has restrictive
immigration laws with further curbs planned later this year.
New rules to halt illegal immigration include cuts in benefit payments
to asylum seekers, expected to be announced in the Queen's speech.
Ministers have decided that further legislative action on immigration
and asylum is needed because the numbers seeking refugee status on
arrival in the UK has begun to rise. Fraudulent asylum seekers are to be
weeded out with ever more zeal.
The see-us-we're-tough stance is intended to convey to anyone planning
to come to Britain, if they are in any doubt, that we are not a soft
touch. Ministers claim many of those who come to Britain seeking asylum
are economic migrants rather than refugees fleeing persecution. Just
over 19,000 asylum seekers came to Britain in the first six months of
this year. Only 825 people were granted refugee status last year. It
will be many fewer this year.
While Ministers justify further tightening of immigration rules
claiming abuses are grossly unfair on genuine refugees, critics point
out that the thrust of immigration-control policy over the past 20 years
-- from the major Immigration Act of the early seventies to visa
restrictions of the past few years -- have been aimed at controlling the
numbers of non-whites who want to settle here.
Primary immigration from places such as the Indian sub-continent
stopped years ago. Yet families of second-generation British Asians
report huge problems trying to get permission even for visits by
grandparents.
Critics also point out that for those who do attempt to invoke the
rules of asylum, detention in prison without trial is increasingly used.
There are on average 11,000 detainees held for periods varying from a
few days to months, and occasionally years, awaiting consideration of
their claim.
The Government has also revoked the automatic right of constituency
MPs to intervene before deportation or removal. It introduced, too,
legislation which holds airlines responsible, on penalty of stiff fines
and threats to their licences, if they carry passengers without the
appropriate visas.
Such restrictive immigration laws, and a succession of ''crackdowns''
may play well to those of the xenophobic tendency, but in the crashing
of doors slamming of bolts against the putative hordes, perhaps the
politicians have missed the questions that arise: isn't Britain already
a country of immigrants? Hasn't it needed regular floodings of outsiders
over the centuries to keep it fertile? Is there a single person alive
today in the UK who can claim to be a pure native Briton?
Perhaps the problem is not how to stop them coming here -- it's how to
get more of them in. We may have failed very badly with the Hong Kong
Chinese, whose energy and expertise have gone instead to Canada and
America.

He was known to his friends as Brandon Lee, schoolboy -- but to his
mother he was Brian MacKinnon, hard-working mature student. In an
exclusive interview with Ron McKenna, the would-be doctor who amazed the
world tells how his double life came about. Pictures by Patrina Malone
Had I somehow, by magic, been presented with the opportunity of
bypassing
school and going straight to medical school I would have grasped it
gladly
BRIAN MacKinnon's double life began with the kind of luck and goodwill
that enabled him to present himself as a 17-year-old pupil undetected
for almost a year. Sitting with a senior member of staff in Bearsden
Academy in May 1993 he showed her a letter from his father and told his
concocted story of how he had been schooled in Canada by tutors. As the
enrolment form was ticked off the member of staff conducting his
interview looked up from the form and said: ''Birth certificate? No?
I'll believe you.''
He was remarkably controlled about the whole affair: ''I thought it
could go wrong, but I didn't get any bad vibes. I had already made the
decision to go through with this and there wasn't time for internal
debate.''
While fully aware of what he was doing and under no delusions about
the risks he was taking, Brian managed to remain calm as he started
school as Brandon Lee.
''I can't exactly remember the first day, but nothing outstanding
happened and I just moved around the school. I was fearful of what might
happen, but nothing did.
''I was aware of the fear of being found out during the first week. I
was worried about the embarrassment, but although I had pangs of guilt,
overall I thought I was doing the right thing.''
Fellow pupils were largely accepting and Brian said he was neither
stared at nor questioned in his first few weeks. And remarkably only two
incidents brought the danger of his situation home to him.
''They stick in my mind. The first happened in the school yard when I
overheard two younger boys talking. One asked the other: 'How old is
that guy?' and his friend replied: 'I don't know. I think he's in the
fifth year.' The first then said: 'Face about 40!'
''I came home and asked my mum jokingly if I really looked that old.
But it wasn't a big deal.
''The second occasion was in the maths class where there was an
exchange student from California. He was a lot more robust for his age
than the other children and he had receding hair. I heard a boy sitting
near mutter under his breath: 'That's two 30-year-olds we've got now'.
''Beyond that there were no other disconcerting incidents regarding my
age. The whole year went surprisingly smoothly and at times I was quite
at ease. There was no sense of a Peter Pan situation where I was
actively enjoying myself. I didn't want to do this. Had I somehow, by
magic, been presented with the opportunity of bypassing school and going
straight to medical school I would gladly have grasped it with both
hands.''
Of all the schools in Glasgow Brian could have chosen to return to,
Bearsden Academy would seem the least likely choice because of the
danger of being recognised.
''I decided to go back there,'' he explained, ''because there was very
little time left until the beginning of term and other schools would not
take pupils from outwith their catchment areas. Circumstances had a
funnelling effect and all roads seemed to lead to Bearsden Academy,
which for obvious reasons would not have been my choice. I had been
there before and I knew there were teachers that had been there before
as well.''
But his appearance had changed, he had lost three stones when ill, his
face had developed and, as a last-minute attempt to change how he
looked, he had had his hair permed.
''I detected no suspicions from the teachers throughout the year. They
were always very pleasant and helpful.
''I was never comfortable with the role I was playing, but I managed
to put it to the back of my mind by concentrating on my work. I wanted
to perform well but I had to keep my foot off the accelerator to a
certain degree because I didn't want to end up in the newspaper for
having won prizes or stood out from the others.''
Despite his growing confidence he took steps to avoid the school
playground. During breaks he stood in the canteen hall. ''I would wait
on my own but pretty soon people would come and stand next to me.
''I spoke affably with these people but I used a Canadian accent
because it fitted in with my story. I said that I had lived abroad and
now lived with my grandmother so that no-one asked too many questions.
''I had lunch every day at home with my mother, who believed I was a
mature student, and after school I usually worked at home or watched
television in my house.''
At no time until the end of the school year did Brian go out socially
with people at school, although he started to make friends when he
became involved in the school play. Some of these people remained close
to him after he left school and went to Dundee University and at least
one accompanied him on a holiday to Tenerife the following year.
He found himself caught between wanting to remain in the sidelines and
not draw attention to himself and the knowledge that to get a good
report from the school he would have to participate.
''The school's report goes to the universities just after the prelims,
long before the Highers are sat and I knew that. But when I was asked to
take part in the school play, at first I refused. The teacher, a lovely
lady, pressed me and I said I would take a back-stage role.
''When I discovered I was going to play one of the leading roles I was
terrified. I was aware that there was the risk that someone in the
audience might recognise me. But when it came to it I was so caught up
in learning my lines and general stage nerves that I managed to put that
fear behind me. You can only worry about one thing at a time.''
Brian's out-of-school contact with friends was limited to helping two
fellow male pupils with their maths revision at his home and occasional
games of tennis and football.
''I didn't go out at all with people from school until I was asked to
play football a few months after I started at school. I can never resist
a game of football. But I was aware I was physically stronger and never
used my weight.''
Throughout the year the prospect of him being discovered appeared less
and less likely to him. Before he had started at school he was
reasonably confident that he could pass himself off as a teenager.
''Until recently I have had a complexion of someone younger than my
years. People repeatedly told me that. I knew I could look younger. I
also had an illness between 18 and 20 when I lost almost three stones. I
only ever regained around half that weight, so I still have the frame of
a schoolboy. I didn't see much technical difficulty in appearing to be
someone of that age.''
He had realised that the only way he would be ever admitted to a
medical faculty in Scotland was to take the drastic course of assuming a
new identity and going back to school to sit his highers.
The reason, he said, was because he felt that as a 17-year-old he had
been cheated out of completing his degree in medicine when had been
asked to leave Glasgow University after a long illness.
''I started studying in October 1980, but became ill towards the end
of the first term. I carried on with the course, but I failed three
exams, I resat them and passed. I then entered second year but was still
ill. There were long periods of forced absence. Then I was summoned to a
meeting and told I had to leave with no guarantee of readmission.
''I felt devastated. I felt as though I had been robbed and cheated
out of my place at university. Ironically, I suppose, I later tried to
cheat my way in. This was all about regaining that stolen opportunity.''
After university Brian worked for three years, including some time at
Glasgow University library. While at the library in 1986-90 he applied
for a BSc course in biological science at the university.
''I applied with the sole aim of returning to medical school. Although
a science degree was not what I wanted to do it was a way back into
medicine. I applied to the medical faculty every year without success,
despite an outstanding academic record.
''In the fourth year of my BSc I was told finally I wasn't going into
medical school.''
Brian then tried various other avenues to restart his medical career
including very briefly studying at a university in Canada.
''My father was terminally ill with cancer in 1993. In my last
conversation with him I asked him if he thought that I could yet do
something purposeful and fulfilling with my life and he replied that
'perhaps we all have our day'. My mum later told me that he said to her
'don't worry May, he'll make it yet'.
''He can't have known I was thinking about going back to school but
although his response may have seemed to an outsider, that I had already
had my day, I was acutely aware that this would be our last conversation
and I was listening more with my heart than my head.''

deliver the fourth season of Lothian European Lectures in Edinburgh.
The regional council is a major sponsor of the lectures which this
year will explore ''Special Relationships'' in an international context.
Other speakers will include US ambassador Admiral William Crowe; Sir
Alastair Morton, co-chairman of the troubled Eurotunnel; and Sir David
Steel, president of Liberal International.
Lothian region convener Eric Milligan pledged yesterday that although
the council would disappear under local government reorganisation, the
lectures, ''which had done so much to contribute to the promotion of
Edinburgh and Scotland'', would continue.

Washington
THE Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has once again threatened to
pull down the pillars of the temple if he does not get his way. He said
that he would not allow the US Government to borrow more money when it
reaches its present legal debt ceiling in November if the president has
not accepted Republican plans for a balanced budget.
At worst, this would mean the US defaulting on its obligations.
Markets around the world almost collapsed last January when Mexico
nearly defaulted. The Americans mounted a last-minute rescue, finding a
$25bn (#16bn) loan at short notice. If the United States defaults, the
crisis would be far worse. The payment which might fail is $25bn on
November 15, with other equally large ones in the weeks to follow.
Mr Gingrich and his troops in the House have proposed a series of
measures that they claim would balance the federal budget in 2002. A
first instalment includes severe cuts in a number of programmes that Mr
Clinton insists are essential, and he threatens to veto any measure
imposing those cuts.
Mr Gingrich's answer to this threat is to double the stakes, and to
prevent the government's debt ceiling being raised. If the Treasury is
faced with bankruptcy in November, there are various accounting gimmicks
that could be employed to cover the case, at least on a temporary basis,
and under certain elastic notions of fiscal responsibility the
government might scrape by for another year, until the next election.
However, none of the ideas is very sound and many may not be legal.
The speaker repeated his threat to force the government into bankruptcy
in a speech at a Republican meeting yesterday. He said that balancing
the budget was so important that it was worth a little turmoil in the
short term.

Washington
THE historic Israeli-PLO agreement to transfer much of the occupied
West Bank to Palestinian control will be signed at a White House
ceremony at noon local time on Thursday, the White House said tonight.
President Clinton will preside over what will be the third Middle East
treaty of his presidency.
He will greet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, as well as the leaders of Egypt and Jordan, said
spokesman Mike McCurry.
''The President looks at this as being a momentous moment for the
Middle East peace process,'' he said, and aims to use the ceremony to
try to create additional momentum for a comprehensive agreement.
Britain has already welcomed the agreement and Mr Arafat will meet the
Prime Minister in London on his way to the signing ceremony. Mr Major
will underline the need to implement the deal ''with determination'' in
the face of expected attacks from extremists on both sides, diplomats
say.
The accord, initialled yesterday after marathon talks between Mr
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in the Egyptian resort
of Taba, expands the existing Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho to
the West Bank.
It envisages the withdrawal of Israeli forces from six cities and more
than 400 villages, but keeps Israeli troops in parts of Hebron to
maintain the security of 400 Jewish settlers who live among 100,000
Arabs.
However the deal received only a muted welcome today from Palestinians
who wondered just how much freedom self-rule would bring.
Undaunted, Mr Arafat returned to Gaza from Jordan saying it would ''no
doubt'' pave the way for a Palestinian state.
''It's our right to look forward. It is a dream of our people,'' he
said on his arrival from Amman, where he received support for the accord
from Jordanian leaders.
Palestinian reaction ranged from eager anticipation in the northern
West Bank town of Jenin, where the Israeli withdrawal will begin, to
claims of a sell-out in the southern town of Hebron.
The militant Hamas Islamic group rejected the agreement as an attempt
to ''consecrate the Israeli occupation'' of Palestinian land.
Other hard-line Palestinian groups called it a capitulation which
entrenched the presence of more than 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza, both captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
Syria, whose own peace talks with Israel are deadlocked, also
condemned it.
Under the deal Israel will start withdrawing its troops from the West
Bank, except for parts of Hebron, 10 days after it is formally signed
and will complete the pull-out within six months.
Palestinian elections will be held 22 days later and Arafat will send
12,000 Palestinian police into the West Bank, bringing his total forces
there and in Gaza to 30,000 men.
Their main job will be to keep the lid on Islamic opponents who have
embarrassed Arafat with a wave of suicide bombings against Israelis.
Israel will have to keep in check Jewish settlers who have vowed to
ignore the authority of Palestinian police. Their continued presence in
the centre of Hebron is an important test of the agreement, which does
not even begin to tackle the explosive issues of Jerusalem and the 140
Jewish settlements. Talks on those and other ''final status'' questions
are imminent.--Reuter.

MILLIONS of low earners are being urged to stake their claim to a
#500m ''money mountain'' of wrongly-paid tax. The Inland Revenue
estimates that up to six million people, mainly pensioners, students,
children, and married women, may be eligible for a refund after
mistakenly paying tax on their savings.
Launching the Inland Revenue's first special Taxback Week in London
yesterday, deputy chairman Clive Corlett said: ''The purpose of the
Inland Revenue is to ensure that people pay the right amount of tax, not
too much and not too little, and this campaign is further evidence of
our determination to achieve that.
''We can't be sure of getting things right every time as long as there
are people out there paying too much tax and, because we don't know who
they are, they need to reveal themselves to us. They need to identify
themselves.''
Those who think they may be eligible to claim tax back can ring
freephone 0800 660800. They will be sent a Taxback Pack containing forms
to claim tax back and to tell their bank or building society.

Teddy Taylor argues that not only should we shun a single European
currency but a referendum is needed to settle our status in the EU
THE support given by John Major to the Germans at the Majorca summit
of the EU on their contention that many EU nations will not be ready to
join the single currency in 1999 has been interpreted widely as good
news for the Eurosceptics. And the comments by Malcolm Rifkind the
previous week that Britain would accept harmonisation only if it suited
our national interests were also interpreted as a move towards a tougher
Eurosceptic policy.
However, in practice, Mr Rifkind's sentiments will be difficult to
deliver when so many Euro harmonisation proposals are now subject to
majority vote, and on the wider issue of the Euro currency, it is sadly
a fact that despite a massive change in German public opinion the
enthusiasm for EMU among the Euro decision makers is as great as ever.
The change of heart at Majorca -- with the solitary exception of
Sweden which has encountered economic disaster since its ''Yes'' vote in
the referendum and does not wish to become more involved in Euro
initiatives because their public opinion links the disaster, I think
wrongly, to the EU vote -- has not been on the merits of EMU. The only
basic change was that the Germans, who are in the driving seat over EMU,
have determined that there would be no merit in including nations like
Italy and Belgium which have horrific financial problems. There is
certainly no change in the enthusiasm of nations like Italy and Belgium
to join.
The likely outcome of Majorca is not that EMU will be abandoned, only
that it may be delayed or else that the initial grouping of EMU members
with a single currency may be a small one.
Even in the case of the UK, there was no question of a change of
heart. Our official position is still that we will consider membership
on its merits at the time and that the Government might consider the
possibility of a referendum on joining the single currency. However,
even this referendum would be of limited value because before the UK
could be considered for single currency membership we would have to have
been locked into fixed exchange rates for two years and so our monetary
independence would be similar to Scotland within the UK on the basis
that we would have separate currency notes which would be purely
presentational.
Unlike our last experience with the ERM which resulted in massive
borrowing, an estimated additional 500,000 unemployed and eventual
exclusion or withdrawal on White Wednesday, the Maastricht Treaty
provides that any future rejoining of the ERM or fixed exchange rates
would be irreversible.
But why is there such enthusiasm for a single currency when so many
experts, including Bernard Connelly who was in charge of the EMU
secretariat at Brussels, have warned it would inevitably produce mass
unemployment, civil disruption and political union without democracy. Mr
Connelly in his rather exciting book points out that artificial exchange
rates will inevitably create deflation. To add to the alleged attraction
for Britain, he has stated clearly since the publication that the
concentration of economic and political power in Germany will devastate
the UK's financial sector.
Another issue which cannot be disregarded is that if we establish what
is in effect a European state the more successful and prosperous nations
will have to accept full responsibility for the economies and national
debts of the weaker ones.
So what would be the right course for the UK?
The best step would be to make it clear to the EU that there is simply
no way in which the UK would consider becoming involved in fixed
exchange rates again and that in consequence we would never consider
ourselves as candidates for a single currency. If such a statement were
to be made, it could well strengthen the position of President Chirac
who is said to be wholly unenthusiastic about monetary and political
union.
But there are many other issues on which there is a need for the UK to
take the initiative. The agricultural policy of the EU, for which reform
has been promised so often, is again breaking the expenditure records.
The draft budget of the EU for 1996 states on agricultural spending that
despite modest estimates, its spending will undoubtedly break through
its legal limits. The last time this problem arose, when Mrs Thatcher
was Prime Minister, the issue was resolved by declaring a metric year
for accountancy purposes with 12 months' income linked to 10 months'
spending. Tough action by the UK to prevent a recurrence is vital.
We also have a major problem with border controls. Britain claims to
have the right to maintain border controls. But sadly our entitlement
depends on a declaration attached to the Single European Act. A
declaration does not have adequate status to stand in any case before
the European Court. What is needed is a demand at the 1996 IGC to have
the declaration transferred to being a treaty clause.
Perhaps most important of all, before we move further into the Euro
enterprise it is vital that the people of the UK should be given the
opportunity of expressing their opinion. The nation belongs to the
people and not to the political class. They should be asked in a
referendum whether they would prefer to proceed with Euro integration,
or to seek a separate relationship with the EU or to seek total
disengagement.

A FARMER yesterday told how he cradled an injured driver for three and
a half hours after two vehicles plunged 50ft into the River Teith, near
Doune, Perthshire.
Mr Andrew Wood, 27, from West Bracklinn Farm, Callander, went to the
aid of a lorry driver whose vehicle had collided with a Land-Rover on
the Deanston Bridge which is only wide enough for single-lane traffic.
Mr Wood had arrived on the scene minutes after the two vehicles had
smashed through a parapet and fallen into the river.
The driver of the Land-Rover, Eugene Maxwell, 38, of Achray Farm,
Brig of Turk, Perthshire waded from his vehicle, which was caught under
the coupling of the articulated lorry. He was taken to Stirling Royal
Infimary, where doctors said he had escaped serious injury.
Mr Maxwell said last night: ''It was a miracle. I've just got a sore
shoulder and a sore back and a few cuts and bruises.
However, the driver of the lorry, John Stewart, 56, of Morar Drive,
Condorrat, near Cumbernauld, was trapped in his cab.
Mr Wood said: ''I climbed into the lorry and held the fellow up. He
was stuck by his ankles.
''I held him for three and a half hours. The water was at our feet in
the cab.
''Two ambulance men appeared and one got underneath him, supporting
him by curling up in a ball. That meant I couldn't get out again.
''He was conscious and talking right through. He was in a lot of pain
but he did remarkably well.''
A team from Stirling Royal Infirmary was on the scene throughout the
battle to free Mr Stewart.
Doctors said later he was ''serious but stable''.
Local residents said the accident strengthened their case for widening
the bridge or building a bypass.
Mrs Margo Bain, vice chairwoman of Kilmadock Community Council, said:
''Mothers and children use the bridge regularly to get from Deanston to
Doune. This could have been a real tragedy.''
Scottish Office officials said that traffic calming measures on the
approach to the bridge had been approved.Central Regional Council will
start work on these in November.
Police said last night the bridge would be closed for 24 hours for
repairs.

Beginning an incisive three-day series, Ann Simpson finds Moscow an
incongruous city of goodies and baddies, bodyguards and babushkas, pimps
and patricians. The rush for riches has created moguls from the ranks of
the comrades, and gangsters battle for a share of the action
THE next time horror taunts this city, applying a bullet to the head,
where will Sergei be? Stepping out from behind the driving wheel of his
treasured Jeep, the one stamped like an old cabin trunk with the
show-off labels of the Paris-Dakar rally? Or crouching in the back of
his favourite Mercedes, its rear and passenger windows masked by the
sort of white, pleated satin that sometimes lines the interior of
coffins? With luck -- and we should not discount the charm of
superstition in modern Russia -- Sergei will escape the sneak assassin.
But since luck itself requires encouragement, he already lives within a
scrum of bodyguards who scuttle in unison around him like a monster
crab.
This is Moscow, lousy with gangsters, where the Noviye Ruskie wears
protection as if it were one more ornament to brandish in the face of
poverty. Forty-five million people are now confronting Third World
hardship in the former Soviet Union, but there was a time when today's
New Russian would look on today's impoverished neighbour and call him
comrade. Everyone was a comrade then, a lie of course, the big lie at
the heart of communism. And when the system finally perished, those
determined to gorge on riches as never before sheared off from the
masses, causing each side to damn to hell the other's contemptible soul.
For Sergei Lisovsky, there are days now when he seems more packed
about with minders than the Prime Minister. And it may be true that
Viktor Chernomyrdin is considered by many to be more dispensable than
Sergei, whose sullen nature sits oddly with his flamboyant vocation. At
34, he is the Big Mover in Russia's rapidly developing entertainment and
advertising industries, his control of rock concerts, the video market,
and now his latest appointment as director of advertising for ORT, the
public television station, confirming mogul status. But in the cryptic,
unstable world of dollar-loaded Russia there is stupendous flagrancy
about his emergence as adman supremo for the cash-starved TV station.
ORT, formerly known as Ostankino, serves as the voice of the current
government, which earlier this year decided to reform the network's
vastly unprofitable affairs. What the new management discovered in the
process was a complex web of corruption and theft, so vast in scale that
the government imposed a four-month moratorium on commercial advertising
at the station. This has now been lifted but, like so much else in a
country with only ramshackle controls, the moratorium seemed to deepen
the crisis, further depriving ORT of tens of millions of dollars. More
dangerously, perhaps, it fell like the guillotine on the necks of those
advertising wholesalers, independent producers, and network employees
who had long been living off the fat of fraud, siphoning off thousands
of dollars from the station into their own pockets every week.
There are those who say that the personal loss of these illicit funds
was the motive behind the murder last March of Vladislav Listyev, the
popular television personality who had just assumed charge of ORT. At
the time, police investigated, but did not charge, Sergei Lisovsky in
connection with the killing. Now here he is, this latest big-shot
appointment demonstrating something sinister about how power still works
in Russia.
Accusations that his new job must lead to a conflict of interests are
met only by the indifferent shrugs of those involved. Lisovsky's patron
is the deputy chairman of ORT, Boris Berezovsky, who observes: ''I
realise there will be a lot of questions, but let's be realistic. This
is Russia. We have a very small market of real businessmen. Lisovsky is,
for sure, the best.'' Such modesty on Berezovsky's part costs him
nothing: an internationally known mathematician, who 10 years ago was
earning 500 roubles a month, today he heads the country's biggest car
dealership, LogoVAZ, which is now one of ORT's new owners after the
government, in a secret deal, sold 49% of the channel to loyal
commercial cronies. Like his protege, Berezovsky, too, was questioned
about Vlad Listyev's killing, but no evidence of wrongdoing was found.
However, his words do explain much about the unruliness of the
present. Without any democratic checks and balances, the rush to
capitalism has turned Moscow into a wild frontier town where, in the
stand-off between goodies and baddies, the winner is always the guy with
the best insider information for doing deals with the Kremlin. There are
many politicians and competing advertisers, of course, who believe
Sergei Lisovsky was the architect of the very system ORT's new masters
vowed to root out. But in Moscow's power circles, who has ever cared
about promises? Meanwhile, the Listyev murder, along with many others,
remains unsolved.
On this dog day of summer, Lisovsky is behind the wheel of his black
Mercedes, swinging into a reserved parking space beside LIS, his
headquarters accommodated in a graceless concrete building erected for
the Moscow Olympics in 1980. The stadium remains, used now for pop
concerts, a reminder to Lisovsky that his entrepreneurial baptism was as
a pioneering DJ, raking in no more than 20 roubles a gig. Before
alighting from the car he waits for an accompanying Toyota Jeep to line
up precisely behind him. Only then do the doors of both vehicles snap
open, and -- as if worked by some universal reflex -- Sergei and five
bodyguards emerge into the sunshine simultaneously. He turns and looks
hard in our direction, a small group -- one interpreter, one journalist,
and Lisovsky's own press secretary who inclines his head slightly
towards his boss, indicating our visit is legitimate.
There is no question that Lisovsky will be interviewed by us, of
course. Already he has acquired a rich man's loathing for reporters, and
always refuses to talk to the press. Now, as he moves towards the
entrance of LIS, his amber jacket is just visible through the huddle of
heavies. Even so, we have observed enough of his face to recognise a
rather churlish look of introspection.
Lisovsky, they say, was furious recently when his portrait on the
cover of Russia's leading business magazine made him appear -- in his
view, anyway -- to have a smile filled with metal teeth. Today he wears
his dark hair poetically to the collar, shunning the shaven skull that
is the fashionable leitmotif for Russia's young despite its gulag
connotations.
Life has taught Lisovsky to be vigilant for any glitch on the horizon,
logging it away as an intimation of hostility. And yet, for someone so
ready for attack, that amber jacket is an aberration, the merest glimpse
of it, amid the glum bulk of his minders, providing enough of a golden
target for professional hitmen. Still, if the rich can't indulge in
vanity, what's the point? For Sergei Lisovsky the point exceeds far
beyond the opportunity to drape himself in luxury.
Within Russia his aim is to become the ''universal general'' of the
leisure and consumer media, and as such he is already courted and petted
by significant politicians. His purchase of five and a half hours of air
time on one of the country's most accomplished television stations, the
St Petersburg Good Morning Channel, is among his most important
acquisitions.
At the Cannes Film Festival, his agents buy up Russian rights to
around 300 movies a year, giving him considerable clout over what films
are to be shown in cinemas and on television. And, like many fresh
millionaires, he is star-struck. Not long ago he opened Fellini's, a
nightclub and casino of decadent opulence (gold, crimson, and violet
decor, and a minimum admission of $500), where big names in
entertainment dine and play and finagle, and the house rules dictate no
denims, no prostitutes.
Ostensibly, Lisovsky's most irritating competition springs from
counterfeit videos. Moscow's commitment to fast-buck corruption is
nowhere better revealed than in the fact that 90% of films circulating
in the capital are pirated and poor quality stock. Often, too, the greed
to seize control of major movies leads to hilarious incompetence. Before
it appeared anywhere at all, Kevin Costner's splashy but foundering
Waterworld had an unofficial premiere in Moscow. What its subterranean
dealers hadn't realised, however, was that their copy, filched from a
Hollywood cutting room, was scarcely more than a discarded rough cut
with the storyline omitted.
So why would Lisovsky bother with an industry dominated by chicanery?
''We see it this way,'' says Dmitry Tugarin, an LIS executive. ''We own
the remaining legal 10% of the market. That is bound to increase as the
public becomes more educated about movies and realises that the pirates
don't operate in their interest.''
Recently, LIS demanded a $100,000 fine from a pirate for infringing
Lisovsky's rights to The Mask. ''The man obviously couldn't pay so we
struck a deal -- he could carry on distributing the movie, but only if
it carried the LIS logo. As a result, he has now become legitimate,
joining our newly formed Association for Copyright Owners. Gradually, as
court cases are brought against other pirates, more of them will see
that it is futile to challenge us -- and so we will regularise the
culture.''
For 80% of the population, however, life remains an intolerable
burden, the indicators of Third World poverty becoming more and more
apparent: diphtheria has re-emerged, and Moscow's long heatwave summer
was marred by an outbreak of cholera. The birth rate is decreasing as
women refuse to add to the hardship by having children, and the life
expectancy of men has been reduced by nearly a decade, to 58 years. By
the end of this year at least one-third of Russia will not have
sufficient food to sustain it healthily through the winter.
But the poverty is not without its own peculiar silver lining: ''We
gauge the population keeps more than #12bn under its mattress,'' says
Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy head of the country's Federal Securities
Commission. With this secret fortune in mind there is a proposal for
legislation that would encourage the creation of mutual funds whereby
domestic savings are poured into the production economy to help reverse
Russia's appalling industrial contraction. The government calculates
that six to 10 per cent of the money stashed under beds could be
attracted to the scheme, but the truly shameful fact is that more than
$25bn has already been spirited out of the country as flight capital,
much of it growing even fatter in clandestine Swiss accounts instead of
being used to make industry work back home.
On the other side of town from Fellini's, the Noviye Ruskie is
queueing for entrance to Cherry's Casino, an establishment less
sumptuous than Lisovsky's den. Nevertheless, the valets are so busy
overseeing flashy country Cadillacs, Range Rovers, and sleek Jeeps that
the car park looks like a motor dealer's midnight convention.
Inside, festooned around the bar, there are 50 or so girls, pale,
luminous-skinned creatures with dazzling eyes. Finely boned as gazelles,
they are dressed in the body furniture of international chic: Chanel
belts and Versace spangles; Prada handbags and Dolce and Gabbana
basques. In another setting they could be debutantes, giggling together
over the night's prospective conquests. In fact, they are prostitutes,
and it is among the saddest aspects of Moscow life just now that so many
of the jeunesse d'oree pin their fate to pimps, believing sex for sale
their only means to make fast money for escape.
There is such perfection about the girls' grooming that the hand of a
wardrobe mistress, or even their mothers', might be at work. But the
Mafia is the only quality controller here, and on tonight's performance
the rules are strict: no hustling for custom, no alcoholic drinks.
Instead, the girls sit on bar stools quietly greeting one another like
enigmatic members of a harem.
The duty pimp chats with them, as jovially as a brother, since
business at their end of the room is slow. But in casino terms it is too
early yet for carnal distraction, and there is about the place a leaden
intensity as customers concentrate on the tables. East or West, no one
in the world seems to laugh in a gambling house.
But the croupiers, like the hookers, are a classy lot. They could be
intellectuals re-working themselves to more lucrative ends. That girl
with the braided hair, who constantly scans every facial expression at
her table, might be a brilliant musician. The chap with the wire
spectacles and the Einstein haircut might indeed be a physicist.
Upstairs on the dance floor, a peculiar chasteness presides. Once
again the girls are clustered like tasteful flower displays. More flimsy
silk shorts, more star-dusted bandeau bras, more satin corselets, and
tanned limbs dangling into skittish stilettos, jewelled heels winking
with the promise of exotic tricks. Suddenly, two floor walkers trundle a
man off the dance floor for groping a woman. Too astonished to protest,
he doesn't find his voice until he's been lobbed into the car park, and
then he shouts: ''Who made it a crime for a man to fondle his wife? Even
under the Soviet terror there was never such an offence.''
Earlier that evening, the Hotel Metropol had beckoned, its fin de
siecle glory now assiduously brought up to scratch by the
Intercontinental Group so that it has become the favoured temporary
residence of foreign politicians and power brokers, and various
joint-venture elites.
At the start of the week the American Vice-President's delegation had
been housed there, and one morning a bellhop caused a mild collective
seizure by entering the breakfast hall, bearing a call sign printed with
the name Gore in full capitals. We laughed, but in a city where bloody
coups can happen over grapefruit, a word like gore might yet announce
some monstrous happening in Red Square.
On that Saturday night, however, Ross Perot was in town. In a sense,
there is no better place than Moscow in Klondyke transition for a flaky
American capitalist with gimlet eyes still searching for that big win --
wherever it may be. On this occasion Perot was the guest of honour at a
Sotheby's charity auction of contemporary Russian art. The proceeds were
in aid of a Moscow hospital which is a world leader in the treatment of
children's burns, and tickets were $500 a head, a steep sum in a country
with no experience of holding gala benefits for others' welfare. Would
New Russians dominate the affair? Or would the Metropol's exquisitely
mirrored banqueting suite be peopled with embassy dignitaries and
overseas business personnel?
As it happened, 80% of the tickets went to Russians, although not
entirely to the nouveau riche. Instead, here was the country's Sredny
klas, its cultivated middle class, a small enclave which, through all
the bad years, had managed somehow to hang on to its battered old trunks
of treasure and courtly European manners. Next came squads of the
influential new bankers, lawyers and utilities businessmen such as
Chernomyrdin, who made his fortune from Gazprom, the privatised Russian
gas and oil monopoly. Grey, quick-witted men, shrewd enough so far to
outmaneouvre the more gaudy gangsterism but, for that very reason,
paranoid about security.
What could Perot preach to this audience that, through years of covert
worldliness, they did not already know? He told them to be like Japan.
He urged them to establish millions of small businesses, and, oblivious
of irony, to ''terminate'' anyone found lying, cheating, or stealing
within a company. ''Adversity,'' drawled Perot, ''breeds stength. One
person can change the world.'' He delivered this lecture in banalities
for more than an hour, and through much of it his audience had the sense
to remove their simultaneous translation earphones and take a comfort
break.
As we observed Perot's old, cracked vision, a Russian journalist who
had covered the last presidential race to the White House remembered how
the little Texan mischief-maker had signed up paid ''volunteers'' as his
campaign workers, and when reporters called his briefing freephone they
found they were automatically logged as urging Perot to run. So much for
homespun integrity. But that Sotheby's evening raised $300,000, and
towards its end a handful of spivish New Russians swanked into the
gathering, flexing wallets for the auction's star lots.
Outside, limousines purred in anticipation of departures and the
gilded crowd emerged on to the pavement, heads craning to spot
bodyguards and chauffeurs. Ross Perot had said that wealth was the most
over-rated commodity in the world, but practically everyone in Moscow
now seemed to believe that wealth was infinitely preferable to politics.
It would soon be midnight and the temperature was still around 85
degrees. Between two Mercedes a decrepit babushka stood with her hand
outstretched for change, but charity's hour had passed, and on the face
of rich and poor alike there was that imprint of rage which money
sometimes causes. A stare of hard, unyielding hate.
The winner has the best insider information for doing deals with the
Kremlin

SCOTLAND faces a ''next generation brain drain'' with 58% of its
future workforce preparing to seek work abroad in the search for the
right conditions, according to a UK survey of 16-18-year-olds released
yesterday.
The study, commissioned by the Government agency, Investors in People
UK, warns that UK job trends are out of touch with young people's needs.
While employers seek flexibility, increasing their reliance on contract
and part-time workers, the youngsters' main priority is to have job
security.
The majority are now considering employment overseas as a result, the
report concludes.
In the survey, taken of 1000 16-18-year-olds ranging from university
entrants to unqualified school leavers, only Newcastle and Wales show
higher rates than Scotland for those considering an overseas job search.
Ms Mary Chapman, Investors in People UK chief executive, said: ''If UK
companies want to recruit the best and most innovative people, they are
going to have to look seriously at what they have to offer.
''If British employers do not start to invest in young people, they
are in danger of losing their best resource overseas.''
However, she added: ''The world of work is changing dramatically. Work
is becoming more project based. Young people need to recognise that they
may move between jobs and therefore require varied and transferable
skills.''
CBI Scotland assistant director Paul Walker called the number of young
Scots in the survey considering work abroad ''high'' and a matter for
concern.
''It clearly might be a serious disadvantage if it is borne out in
practice,'' he said.
He dismissed some youngsters' fears over job security as stemming from
the desire for ''someone to hold their hand'' and anticipated that those
with entrepreneurial instincts would remain in the country.
He added: ''The survey also confirms that Scots have always had a more
international focus. There is a strong tradition of Scots spending time
abroad and bringing money back into the economy.''
Across the UK, security, good working conditions and job variety led
the list of the youngsters' priorities: 75% said they would shun the
offer of superior pay and perks at a rival company in favour of one
which invested time and energy in training and development.
Three fifths of young Scots anticipated holding two jobs or less in
the next 10 years, the second highest proportion. Overwhelmingly, they
are optimistic about their future work, with 90% expecting to enjoy
their job and 63% expecting it to contain all of the elements they
consider important.
Virtually everyone surveyed wanted to take responsibility for their
own development and 87% were keen to keep learning throughout their
working lifespan.

AN inquiry has been announced into suggestions that France's nuclear
tests in the Pacific might have caused recent volcanic eruptions in New
Zealand.
The European Parliament is to hold what its environment chairman, Ken
Collins, calls ''an inquiry of the highest scientific calibre'' next
month.
Mr Collins, Euro MP for Strathclyde East, said: ''The current volcanic
action on Mount Ruapehu needs to be studied to see whether seismic shock
from the French bomb tests could have been a contributory factor.''
He will chair the two-day committee of inquiry, starting on October
16, at which the French Minister of Defence, French underwater explorer
Jacques Cousteau, and a number of expert seismologists will be called to
give evidence.
Mr Collins added: ''We intend to ensure that suggestions already
reaching us at the European Parliament that there could be some sort of
link are thoroughly explored in a scientific manner.''
CANBERRA: A conservative Australian politician is linking nuclear
testing by China and France to a recent string of earthquakes around the
Pacific and volcanic eruptions in Montserrat and New Zealand.
In the nation's parliament on Monday, Liberal party backbencher Eoin
Cameron suggested the nuclear explosions were wreaking havoc with the
earth.
''In the South Pacific, the French have been hammering away at the
earth for over 30 years, in fact, 180 nuclear detonations,'' Cameron,
from Western Australia, told his colleagues.
''It has to be asked what happens to the earth's crust?''
But Australian seisomologists say there is no evidence to link
France's nuclear testing with earthquakes or volcanic explosions.
Perhaps, Cameron suggested, only a natural disaster in the streets of
Paris would awaken the French government of President Jacques Chirac to
the dangers.
France exploded an underground nuclear device in French Polynesia on
September 5, just weeks after China conducted an underground nuclear
explosion.
A French defence specialist suggested last week that France would
conduct a second test, possibly its most powerful at around 150
kilotonnes, within 12 days.
France has scheduled up to eight nuclear tests between this month and
next May, but French officials say the series may be cut to seven or
fewer. -- Reuter

SCIENTISTS warned today that New Zealand could be on the verge of its
biggest volcanic eruption for 50 years as Mount Ruapehu blasted out
rocks as big as cars and belched ash and steam 12 miles into the air.
Air traffic was diverted, train services past the volcano halted, a
main road around its base closed and ski slopes shut down.
Eruptions from the Crater Lake area roared up every two to three
minutes, with ash, rock and steam shooting out of the 9000-ft peak.
Civil defence officials put the areas on a ''level four alert,'' which
means a large-scale eruption is regarded as imminent. People living 60
miles away were warned to expect heavy ash falls.
Rescue services at Waiouru military base, 12 miles from the mountain,
were placed on full alert and the soldiers' wives and children were
moved out. However, the 60 residents of Whakapapa village, on the
volcano's slope, were staying put today.
The few ski staff left in the area held a party, cheering each new
explosion. The village has an alarm system to give 20 minutes' warning
if a mud flow heads down the slopes.
The Civil Aviation Authority today closed the air space over much of
New Zealand's North Island, amid worries that volcanic ash could clog
aircraft engines. Two airports -- at Gisborne and Napier -- were closed
after reports of ash falling on the runways.
Falling ash settling on power lines is causing power surges throughout
the North Island. -- AP

I am always conscious of how much better things are for women
It really hasn't amounted to much, my life
A revelation from her father was Margaret Forster's starting point for
an exercise of historical detection and the genesis of a fascinating
social history of the century, of her times. Julia Langdon relates the
story
WHEN an aunt of Margaret Forster's died a few years ago there was some
family debate about her will. The discussion concerned how sometimes a
will can produce a surprise, unexpectedly reveal a dark family secret.
''That kind of thing only happens in novels,'' said the novelist,
knowingly. ''It doesn't,'' said her father, ''it happened to your mum.''
He then related to his astonished daughter how an unknown woman had
turned up at the door on the day that her grandmother was buried,
claiming that she, too, was a daughter to the lately deceased, and
announced: ''I've come to see if there's anything for me.'' Almost as
soon as he told the story, he regretted it.
Margaret was born in 1938 and named after her grandmother, Margaret
Ann, who had died two years earlier. The girl had been brought up to
worship the saintly memory of her namesake and was therefore naturally
fascinated by this extraordinary revelation from her father. It proved
to be the starting point for an exercise of historical detection, but it
was also the genesis of a fascinating social history of the century, of
her times.
''I am interested in the lives of ordinary people.'' Margaret Forster
says this with huge enthusiasm. There is nothing remotely patronising
about it. She is a distinguished biographer and historian, as well as a
novelist, but she is immensely interested in the challenge presented by
faithfully recording the social history of ''ordinary'' people,
working-class people, families like hers.
The normal tools of biographers are not available: the people in
question wrote no letters, had no desks, owned no studies; there are
instead merely half a dozen certificates -- of birth and death and
marriage -- school records, perhaps, local newspapers and, if you are
lucky, contemporary accounts. That is all that exists to mark the
passage of such a person as Margaret Ann.
Margaret Forster, scholarship girl at Oxford, award-winning, famous,
is herself an embodiment of all that has changed for women in general,
but for working-class women, in particular, in the course of the past
century, the past three generations.
That is what her new book is about. She calls it a family memoir, but
it is more important than that because it documents so much that has
happened in women's lives across the past 100 years. It is the story of
Margaret Ann; of Lilian, one of those daughters who thought there were
just the three of them until the day of the funeral; and of Margaret
herself, Lilian's daughter.
''I am always conscious, all the time, of how much better things are
for women,'' Margaret Forster says. We are talking in the comfortable
family house in London, where she and her husband, the writer Hunter
Davies, brought up their three children and where they live if they are
not in the Lake District. There is a bag of daffodil bulbs waiting by
the back door to be planted, as a conscious reminder perhaps of what
they are missing if they are in London in the spring.
The youngest child is 22. The house looks after itself. For six years
now she has been enjoying what she calls the heady days of wonderful
middle age, writing all day, doing what she wants. In the time it has
taken for this new book to wend its way through the processes before
publication, she has written another novel -- Shadow Baby -- about a
woman who gives an unwanted baby up for adoption and lives in terror of
that unknown child. How different it is for Margaret, how very unlike
the lives of Lilian and Margaret Ann.
''You hear so much of people saying feminism hasn't made any
difference, that it's all a con, that all the great efforts have really
not made that much difference: women are still the second sex and all
the so-called reforms don't amount to much. I don't believe this.''
She moves into a spirited description of the differences between the
lives of our grandmothers and ourselves, whatever our social
circumstance. Even without discussing the big changes like those in
education and health, the superficial ones, she says, have been
breathtaking. She conjures up the image of Margaret Ann, down on her
knees scrubbing the stone flags, black-leading the grates; Margaret Ann
who hid the secret of her unknown child because of the shame; Margaret
Ann who was said to have been extremely clever, if illiterate, and who
took all her secrets with her when she went for no, there was nothing in
the will for the other daughter, the one nobody knew about, the fourth
girl -- or, really, the first.
And then Lilian, who got some education, won a scholarship to
higher-grade school, ought to have gone to university and probably would
have done if she had been a boy, but who instead was obliged, upon her
marriage, to give up her job as a clerk because that is what girls did.
She was a good woman, Lilian, a one-woman social services of her time.
It was her door that the neighbours knocked on when the baby was coming,
unexpectedly; to ask her to lay out the departed; when there was
fighting in someone's house in the middle of the night.
''Don't interfere!'' Margaret's father would say. ''Don't open the
door!'' But she always did, she always helped, much to young Margaret's
open-mouthed relish. Yet she was a disappointed woman, unfulfilled,
''disappointed with life, really,'' her daughter says now. She wanted a
home and children, more than a husband probably, but would not, of
course, have contemplated such a thing, did not know of her mother's
illegitimate child. As the years passed, she became uneasy about her own
children's lives, about how social circumstances changed, how men did
the shopping or even the washing.
And now take the washing: could there be a more potent example of the
liberation of today's woman by the superficial changes in our lifestyle?
On the council estate where Margaret grew up there wasn't a woman with a
washing machine between them and yet today -- didn't she read it
somewhere? -- that 98% of households have a washing machine? We agree
the statistic seems implausible, but even so: what about launderettes?
What about hot running water, for heaven's sake?
''I look at her life and her entire life was self-abnegation,'' says
her daughter.'' She may have wanted it to be different, but on the other
hand she saw quite clearly that education meant moving away in every
sense. She records in the book how, on her deathbed, Lilian said: ''It
hasn't amounted to much, my life.''
This was Carlisle. It is a city which, Margaret Forster discovered in
her very detailed researches for this book, used to be able to boast
that it was home to more people who had lived there for their entire
lives without moving away, than anywhere else in the country. It was a
place which regarded itself as so self-sufficient that in the Second
World War they were quite unsurprised that bombs never fell upon them
because they believed that the war was going on somewhere else; and
where people were, in consequence, fined for failing to wear their
gas-masks.
Lilian and Arthur, Margaret's parents -- and her father is still alive
-- moved in to a brand new house on a brand new estate in 1931. It was a
piece of social engineering, rehousing the slums in a garden city with
shops and a church and everything that ought to have been needed, and it
created so much interest that people used to go on day trips to watch
the builders building it. Every house had a garden, back and front, and
the Forster's was a model, shining inside and blooming out.
For no reason that anyone can really pinpoint, the experiment did not
work, it wasn't much more than 10 years while Margaret was still a girl,
before it started to come to pieces. She has, of course, been back
there: their council house, the house where she was born, is all boarded
up and reputed to be the centre of the local drugs trade; someone had
driven a car through the hedge and her father's lawns were cemented
over, no sign now of the lupins and the roses. As for the community, the
only shops were selling videos or alcohol.
Margaret Forster enjoyed writing this book. It was easy and
interesting and fun. She answered some of the questions about her
family's life but is still left, infuriatingly, with others unresolved.
Margaret Ann's illegitimate child, Alice, died in Carlisle's mental
institution and never had any children herself. Who was her father? What
happened? Who was the mystery lady in black who called on Margaret Ann
and upset her so just before she died? And here is one of the biggest
marks of the change in our social circumstance: Alice lived all her life
just a few streets away from her mother, without acknowledgement. It
would not happen like that today.

Brussels
THE secret of Coke -- the jealously guarded recipe for the
best-selling drink -- could be exposed to the world if one Euro-MP has
his way.
The Brussels Commission has been asked to confirm that the public has
the right to know the real truth about the ''real thing''.
Bavarian socialist Euro-MP Gerhard Schmid is trying to do what no-one
else has done and uncover the ingredient that makes Coca-Cola different
from all other colas.
The Coca-Cola company has always said it will never reveal what gives
its product that special taste -- and the secret has become almost as
famous as the Coca-Cola name and trademark logo.
Schmid has raised the issue in a parliamentary question to the
Brussels Eurocrats, pointing out that an EU directive on the monitoring
of foodstuffs allows unlimited inspection of ''written and documentary
material''.
The Euro-MP says: ''This includes descriptions of the manufacturing
process, ie the recipe. The Coca-Cola company has to date always refused
to allow inspectors access to the recipe for its cola drink. Will it be
obliged in future to disclose the recipe for Coca-Cola?''
The parliamentary question is being studied by consumer affairs
officials at Commission headquarters, but a reply is not believed to be
imminent.
One source said: ''It's a valid point. Although Coca-Cola is not a
European company its product is traded throughout Europe and is
therefore technically subject to the same rules as everybody else.''
Even so, experts say there would be no automatic requirement on a
company to disclose details without good reason.

BELARUS Foreign Minister Uladzimir Syanko told the United Nations
today his country's birth-rate had fallen 50% as a result of the April,
1986, Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
Coping with the after-effects of the catastrophe devoured more than
20% of Belarus's national budget, he added in a speech to the General
Assembly.
Referring to the fire and explosion at the power plant in neighbouring
Ukraine, which released radioactive material over a wide area,
especially Belarus, Syanko said his countrymen had been living for more
than nine years ''under the conditions of ecological disaster.
''The republic spends annually more than 20% of its national budget to
mitigate the economic, ecological, and medical after-effects of the
accident,'' he said.
''But most horrible is what is happening to the . . . health of the
people. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children has increased
manyfold. The birth-rate has fallen 50% as against the period preceding
the accident.''
Syanko, who spoke in English, said genetic diseases were conspicuously
on the rise in the most contaminated areas.
''As time goes by, it becomes more and more evident that the Chernobyl
catastrophe has infringed upon the most sacred of human rights, the
right to life.''--Reuter

Hong Kong
HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten, under fire from Britain and China for
resurrecting the battle to restore the right of abode in Britain to
millions of Hong Kong people, vowed today to continue his fight.
''It's for me to go on putting Hong Kong's case as Governor of Hong
Kong and I will continue to do so,'' a defiant Patten told reporters in
the British colony, due to return to Chinese rule in less than 650 days.
About half of Hong Kong's six million people are eligible for British
Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports, which do not give their
owners the right to settle in Britain.
In a BBC programme broadcast in Hong Kong on Saturday, Patten called
for BDTC passport holders to have their British right-of-abode restored,
a right they had until 1962.
Patten denied today that resurrecting the passport issue would damage
the hard-won visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to London in
October, and shook off charges he was raising false hopes in the British
colony.
''I think all of us recognise the arguments that are put on the other
side,'' Patten said.
He also expressed surprise about the furore created by his comments,
saying he was simply reiterating policy formulated six years ago.
''I think the Hong Kong people are pretty realistic about the
prospects. All of us are pretty realistic about the prospects, but it
doesn't mean we can simply walk away from the argument.''
China lost no time in lashing out at Patten, an old enemy whom Beijing
once described as a criminal for a thousand generations for daring to
implement democratic reforms in Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 handover.
Beijing's representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group said
that Patten's comments would not help improve relations and accused him
of cheating the Hong Kong people.--Reuter

GOVERNOR Chris Patten may have made headlines with his battle to win
right of abode in Britain for millions of Hong Kong residents, but few
are impressed.
''It's nonsense,'' said Eric, a 44-year-old bank employee.
''Britain can't tolerate an inflow of 3.5 million people, and the
Chinese Government won't allow it,'' said 63-year-old retired
optometrist, Chan Tak Chee.
Hong Kong people say Britain is not in any case their preferred
refuge.
''No way I'll go to England,'' Eric added. ''It's hateful. I'll choose
Canada, there are lots of Hong Kong people there.''
''Who wants to go to England? What's so good about it?'' asked a young
bank teller in her mid-twenties.
''Britain's got unemployment problems. If we go there, what can we
do?'' she said.
At least 1000 Hong Kong people emigrate every week, with Canada and
Australia the preferred destinations.
Thousands are also returning with foreign passports, a lifeline if
they need to flee.
However plenty of people are simply blase. ''What's there to be afraid
of? We are all Chinese,'' said 40-year-old news vendor Ah Che.--Reuter.

A PROTESTER against the Criminal Justice Act who ''invaded'' the
garden of Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was fined #350 at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court yesterday.
The Edinburgh Pentlands MP, then Defence Secretary, was the target of
a demo on February 19.
Demonstrators failed to get to the house but police made a number of
arrests, including Edwards.
He was found guilty by Sheriff Annella Cowan of trying to rescue
another protestor from the police and of resisting arrest.
Edwards, 26, unemployed, of Union Place, Edinburgh, denied the
charges.
Inspector Kenneth Buchanan told the sheriff that as the main
demonstration was prevented from getting to Mr Rifkind's Duddingston
home, a group of 50 to 60 tried to find another way in.
One man was arrested when he refused to co-operate with police and
Edwards ran out of the group to pull the man free.
In evidence, Edwards said that he did not know why he was arrested.
Solicitor George More pointed out that Edwards suffered an injury to
his forehead and suggested that it has been inflicted by the police.

Sarajevo
BOSNIAN peace talks were back on track tonight after American
diplomats dashed to Sarajevo on a last-minute rescue mission which ended
a threatened government boycott.
''I think we can approach tomorrow's talks in New York,'' Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told a news conference less than 24 hours
after he had ruled out going there.
The turnaround followed efforts by US envoys Roberts Owen and Chris
Hill to iron out a row over whether Bosnia can be held together as one
country once the war ends.
The fragile three-week-old peace process was in deep trouble yesterday
when Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic ordered his Foreign Minister
Muhamed Sacirbey not to go to the talks in New York with the foreign
ministers of Croatia and Yugoslavia, which is negotiating on behalf of
the Bosnian Serbs.
He accused Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of refusing to accept
a clause in a draft peace deal hammered out in Geneva that would ban the
Bosnian Serbs' ''Republika Srpska'' from seceding from Bosnia to form a
''Greater Serbia'' with its big neighbour.
However Silajdzic said today's make-or-break American mission had
eased some of his concerns.
''We had a successful meeting. I think certain things regarding the
Geneva principles are solved,'' he said.
''Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue its legal existence.''
With attention focused on the survival of the peace process, Russia
said it wanted joint command of future peacekeeping operations and would
not let its troops serve under a Nato-only command.
''First a Nato general and then a Russian general,'' said Defence
Minister Pavel Grachev.
Moscow's stand mirrors its intense criticism of Nato's air blitz of
Bosnian Serb targets before they lifted the siege of Sarajevo.
On the battlefronts of northwest Bosnia, meanwhile, jostling for
position went on after this month's joint Muslim-Croat offensive which
redrew the boundaries between the warring sides.
The Bosnian Serb Army said it had counter-attacked against Muslim and
Croat troops guarding a badly-stretched front line near the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka.
At the same time the UN reported Croat attacks on the so-called Brcko
corridor, the heavily-defended strip linking Banja Luka with the bulk of
Serb-held Bosnia.
UN spokesman Chris Vernon said the Muslims and Croats might end up
fighting a serious campaign if they tried to take on the Serb forces
along the corridor.
''We do believe it could be a military aim of the Croats and Bosnians
to split the corridor,'' he said. ''They would have a very big fight on
their hands.''
Analysts suspect that the Bosnian Government has been emboldened both
diplomatically and militarily by the success of its dramatic sweep
across western Bosnia. Hence its earlier threat to pull out of the New
York talks.
Silajdzic said before today's talks with the US envoys that Serbia was
refusing to accept a paragraph ruling out secession by the Bosnian
Serbs, which he said was a recipe for partition.
''It's too weak, it spells disaster. It's a time bomb,'' he said.
''The central government must be strong enough to hold the country
together. That is something which is not negotiable.''
The draft peace arrangements, drawn up by US Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Holbrooke and agreed in Geneva earlier this month,
envisage Muslim-Croat and Serb ''entities'' which could each form
''special relationships'' with neighbouring states.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he would meet Sacirbey,
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic, and Croatia's Mate Granic
at the UN later today to underline the importance attached to tomorrow's
negotiations.--Reuter.

Jakarta
FIVE young men from East Timor sought asylum today in the British
Embassy in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, saying they were members of
an underground movement opposing Indonesian rule over their homeland.
The five entered the main embassy building in central Jakarta by
telling security guards they were looking for information about Britain.
They then asked for asylum.
''We are looking for political asylum because we are members of the
clandestine movement,'' said Antonio Sequira, one of the five.
They said in a statement issued before they entered the embassy that
brutality had become a fact of everyday life in East Timor in the 20
years since Indonesian troops invaded the former Portuguese colony.
The United Nations does not recognise Indonesian rule.
''A military brutality which has consisted of sudden arrest, rape,
intimidation, terror, and slaughter
. . . a military brutality which has robbed us of the right to
education, has made us prisoners in our own country, and has now forced
us to leave our beloved homeland,'' the statement said.
Indonesia's military has denied allegations of routine brutality. Two
officers were jailed earlier this year after troops under their command
killed six East Timorese villagers in Liquica.
An embassy spokesman said the five were expected to spend the night
inside an embassy building.
''They're being looked after well,'' embassy spokesman John Virgoe
said. He added that there were no plans for their forcible removal from
embassy property.
''We're considering the situation and I have to say it is in London's
hands,'' he said.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed that Britain had received
the application.
The move was the third attempt in two years by East Timorese youths to
escape from Indonesia.--Reuter.

Cuers
A FRUSTRATED love affair may have led a teenager to massacre 13 people
and commit suicide in a weekend rampage in a sleepy town in southern
France, police said today.
Eric Borel, 16, bludgeoned his mother and two other members of his
family to death on Saturday. The next day he stalked calmly through
Cuers, killing and wounding at random with a .22 rifle before turning
the weapon on himself.
Eight people died outright and two more died in hospital. Seven others
were wounded.
Local officials and teenagers said Borel was obsessed with firearms
and Nazi symbols, but police said they were investigating possible
sentimental motives to the killing spree.
The first person Borel shot dead was a teenager who attended his
school and who, according to a fellow student, had had an affair with
Borel's half-sister, the daughter of Borel's stepfather.
The student, named only as Delphine, told TF1 television that Borel
had been in love with his half-sister, who had left home and was
pregnant.
Local officials said Borel had pinned a swastika on his bedroom door
and had pictures of Adolf Hitler and neo-Nazi literature. Fellow
students said he was obsessed with firearms and carried an empty
cartridge on a chain around his neck.
''The carnage of the crazy teenager,'' cried the headline of the
popular daily, France-Soir, which carried a front-page colour picture of
a body half covered with a blood-soaked sheet.
The day before his rampage Borel had battered his mother, stepfather
and 11-year-old half-brother to death with a hammer and a baseball bat
in the nearby village of Sollies-Pont.
In Cuers, north of the Mediterranean port town of Toulon, he fired at
passers-by. Witnesses said he had coolly reloaded his rifle between
shots and at one stage turned around to finish off a man he had wounded
in the leg.
Residents of the town, in a wine-growing area where grape picking was
just getting under way, were in a state of shock and local authorities
said they were arranging medical help for many who had been traumatised
by the massacre.
Neighbours of the family in Sollies-Pont described Borel as a quiet,
inhibited boy who had no friends and never acknowledged people when they
greeted him.
One of Borel's school colleagues told TF1 television that he had heard
him say recently: ''I am going to kill myself. I am sick and tired of it
all.''
Nearly always dressed in black, the teenager had a strong interest in
firearms, the military and paramilitary and had apparently hoped to join
the army.
Psychiatrist Jacques Leyrie said it was clear Borel had been suffering
from acute schizophrenia. Leyrie told France-Soir that committing
suicide at the end of a bloody rampage was a hallmark of schizophrenia.

Montreal
THE three surviving Dionne quintuplets say they and their siblings
were sexually abused by their father for years.
The sisters -- Annette, Cecile, and Yvonne -- made the allegation at
the weekend in a television interview. ''I think we've come to a point
where we had to liberate ourselves from the past and turn the page,''
said Annette.
The Dionne sisters, born in Corbeil, Ontario, in 1934, were believed
to be the first quintuplets to survive infancy. Their upbringing made
them the stuff of three Hollywood films and the sensation of
Depression-era Canada.
They were taken away from their parents and made wards of the Ontario
government, which put them on display for as many as 6000 people a day
who came to watch them play.
Their father, Oliva, fought a nine-year battle to regain custody of
them.
The sisters tried to discuss the abuse with a school chaplain but were
told ''to continue to love our parents and to wear a thick coat when we
went for car rides'' with their father, said Annette Dionne.
Today, the quins' other siblings spoke out to support their father,
who is dead.
''We assert that we had good parents, and that to our knowledge our
father was certainly not a sexual abuser,'' said Therese Callahan told a
newspaper.
Callahan said she was speaking on behalf of the quins' three brothers
and two other sisters. : Oliva, Claude, Victor, Pauline and Rosemarie.--

A SCOTTISH minister has joined the campaign to avert a threat within
the European Commission to Gaelic and other minority languages.
The Rev Jack Macarthur decided to act after reading last week's report
from Strasbourg by Murray Ritchie, European Editor of The Herald, that
the British Government supported the killing off of EU support for
Gaelic.
The minister, of St Columba Gaelic Church, Glasgow, said yesterday:
''A relatively small budget is affected yet between 30 and 40 languages
are involved. It should not be allowed to happen.
''This threat comes at a time when we should be talking to each other
within Europe as much as possible, about problems as much as
opportunities.''
The current total budget for EU languages regarded as in need of
safeguarding is #2.64m and, although the European Parliament would like
to see the figure raised, the powerful Council of Ministers wants it
scrapped.
In reading that Britain supported this move, Mr Macarthur said: ''A
mere several hundred thousand pounds is involved to help Gaelic, Scots,
Welsh, and Cornish, not to mention Irish in Northern Ireland.
''I have spoken to both MEPs and MPs to try to bring pressure to bear
to reverse this decision.'' The minister said the sum was badly needed
as seed money for small projects.
He queried the timing of Britain's stance, especially with the
continuing Northern Ireland peace initiative. ''Reversing this decision
would contribute to the initiative rather than it being seen as a
divisive issue,'' he said.
Mr Macarthur is a former president of the European Bureau of Lesser
Used Languages with headquarters in Dublin. The body lobbies intensively
in Brussels.

Boston
SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch is visiting potential
American investors in Washington and San Francisco this week as hopes
rise that Scotland will shortly land a further significant inward
investment from America.
His itinerary includes companies with initial contacts to those that
are on the brink of taking a final decision on foreign investment.
Officials at Locate in Scotland, the Government agency charged with
attracting foreign investors, are confident that a major investment in
Scotland will be announced within weeks.
Mr Kynoch, who was in Boston yesterday as part of a Scottish Council
Development and Industry trade mission, said the maximum effort
continued to be made to bring American companies to Scotland, but that
he was unwilling to speculate on specific projects until they were
signed, sealed, and delivered.
Apart from meeting potential inward investors, the Scottish Office
Minister was also keen to ensure that the professionalism shown in
attracting foreign investors is now extended to helping smaller Scottish
firms win export orders, which is the main thrust of the SCDI trade
mission.
''I think we have been very successful with our inward investment
strategy through Locate in Scotland which is providing a very well
co-ordinated approach from all the bodies involved, such as Scottish
Enterprise, Scottish Trade International, and the local enterprise
companies.
''What we have to do is get that same professionalism working to the
same end on exports.''
He believes that while Scottish firms have done well in seeing exports
to America grow from #11,800m to #14,000m in the last three years, the
growth should be spread across more sectors and more companies than at
present. While the electronics and whisky companies have been good
exporters, he wants to see growth in areas such as quality food products
and textiles.
Part of the Scottish Office's new export strategy is to set new
targets for the various sectors and also to try to avoid duplication in
the number of trade missions that are presently organised.
The difficulty is the number of agencies involved, including SCDI,
Scottish Trade International, and now local enterprise companies also
want to get in on the act.
One problem for the Scottish Office, however, is to gauge how
successful trade missions actually are. They involve local meetings
between Scottish firms and foreign firms who have expressed an interest
in either buying goods or developing joint ventures with the Scottish
companies. However, it can take a number of years after initial contacts
before significant deals are finally done.
Mr Kynoch also argues that at least the Foreign Office is now better
equipped to help firms break in to the export market with local
embassies and consuls general being far more geared towards commerce and
business than they have been in the past.
However, Mr Kynoch concedes that breaking into the export market can
be difficult for small firms. ''It is a long, hard slog and you cannot
expect to get results simply by parachuting in on one trip and having
one meeting.
''It can take some time but hopefully most firms believe that at the
end of the day it is worthwhile.''
He said while it was not the Government's job to interfere in
business, it ought to help business where possible.
''I see our function as door-opening, so that the firms can go through
that door and achieve business success.''

AN INVESTIGATION began yesterday after a hospital in Edinburgh
received a complaint that a 92-year-old man suffering from a broken leg
was left lying on a trolley for nearly six hours.
The family of Mr Jim Stewart, who suffers from moderate dementia, has
complained to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary about the incident, which
happened at the hospital's accident and emergency department, the only
one in the capital and one of the busiest in Britain.
Mr Stewart was taken to the hospital after a fall at his Edinburgh
nursing home. He was left on a trolley from 5pm until he was admitted to
a ward around six hours later.
He had to wait for treatment because X-ray equipment was being used
for life-threatening cases.
In their complaint, his family make it clear they believe it was not
appropriate to keep such a frail, elderly person waiting so long for
treatment.
A hospital spokesperson said Mr Stewart had been seen by a registered
nurse when he arrived at the accident and emergency department. She
added that the delay had been caused because the X-ray equipment was
being used to deal with three emergency cases.
The spokesperson added: ''There was a delay in this case and the
hospital is looking into the matter. We have received an official
complaint from the family.''

SCOTTISH Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson has taken to the sea to
get to grips with his job and he now plans to send scientists in his
wake.
There is a huge gulf between what the scientists and the seafarers say
about the stocks of fish and Mr Robertson would like the scientists to
follow his route to try to find out why.
To see and hear the problems of the fishing industry before a crucial
European meeting next month, Mr Robertson and The Herald joined Scottish
Fishermen's Federation president Cecil Finn on a voyage to the West
Coast fishing grounds over which there is considerable concern.
As the 65ft seine netter Gleaner eased out of Campbeltown harbour with
Mr Finn's son Tom at the helm, the Minister delivered a major blow to
the fledgling Fishermen's Association Ltd.
The organisation has been born out of the discontent at the refusal of
the SFF to back withdrawal from the EU Common Fisheries Policy but Mr
Robertson said he saw no place for them in the industry.
They were, he said, heading down a blind alley and he saw no reason to
talk to them.
''It is the SFF which has the Government's ear,'' he told The Herald.
''Any split in the fishing industry is divisive and any fragmentation
is unfortunate because as Fisheries Minister I have to try to represent
all Scottish fishermen, to know what they are saying, and that is best
done and my negotiating hand is strongest if they are speaking with one
voice.
''The new organisation, as I understand it, is dedicated to
withdrawing Britain from the CFP. That is not going to happen so they
are putting all their energies into a policy which they are not prepared
to compromise on and which is not going to happen.
''It is not in the best interests of Scottish fishermen.
''They are being led down a blind alley by a small section of the
Scottish industry. There is no major political party in the UK offering
withdrawal from the CFP. It is legally impossible and therefore what we
want is reform of the CFP.''
He said his party, the Government, and fishermen wanted reform so they
should be working together.
He said: ''That is why we set up the CFP review group, on which there
are two Scots, to bring forward proposals to the Government which we can
consider when the CFP is up for renegotiation at the turn of the
century.''
His trip on Cecil Finn's boat was a public show of support for the SFF
and he saw no reason to talk with the Scottish Fishermen's Association.
''All I could say to them is: 'We are not withdrawing from the CFP.'
My message to them is get back into the SFF and speak with one voice. It
is the SFF which has the ear of the Government.''
Cecil Finn certainly did not waste the opportunity to bend the ear of
the Minister. He suspected it was not going to be a financially
successful trip, given its brevity, but he wanted to make as much
political capital as possible. Even as the Gleaner rounded the Island
Davarr, heading for the Sound of Sanda, he was pointing out that the
prawns in the Clyde were bigger and better this year than when he first
fished for them 35 years ago.
There was, he said, no need for restrictive quotas.
The main cause for concern among Scotland's fishermen is the level of
access of the Spanish and Portuguese to western waters from January 1.
As the nets were cast, Mr Robertson said he was confident that it would
not be a problem.
''I think there is a lot of misunderstanding about what will happen
when the Spanish arrive,'' he said. ''Spanish fishing effort in 1996
will be no greater than in 1986. There is going to be no Spanish rape of
our waters. With regard to the controls and enforcement, we have to get
a system in place which our fishermen feel confident in but doesn't
burden them with bureaucracy and increased costs.
''The original proposals coming out of the EU were impractical,
unworkable, and unfair and unacceptable to our fishermen.''
He said he and Mr Tony Baldry, the UK Fisheries Minister, had been
consulting over the summer to find out what the industry wanted from
them at the EU Fisheries Council meeting next month. This encompasses
the vexed questions of how the industry wanted Spanish fishing in UK
waters monitored and what they were willing to accept for their own
fishing effort.
''Obviously, it has to be Community wide,'' he said. ''We cannot just
say we will regulate the Spanish but no-one else. I have been impressed
by the positive attitude taken by the SFF which has led the UK fishing
industry in realism.
''We have to get proposals worked up for next month's council which
are credible, realistic, and workable and that our fishermen can
support. I honestly believe we are on track to do that.''
The SFF has demanded an assurance that the pledge made last year by
former Fisheries Minister Michael Jack, that no new measures to control
effort would be imposed on UK fishermen, would be upheld.
Mr Robertson said this was being held up as some sort of Holy Grail
and had been taken out of context.
''There has to be a proportion of Iberian access and that does have a
knock-on effect on our fishermen,'' he said, adding that if change was
required it would not involve more bureaucracy.
''It is in no-one's interest to have unnecessary bureaucracy and
increased costs but it is in everyone's interests to see a compromise
that every fishermen has confidence in.''
Mr Finn made it clear to Mr Robertson that fishermen had no confidence
in the scientists' reckoning of the fish stocks.
He welcomed the Minister's proposal to send scientists out with the
fishermen because he said the scientific advice was one of the biggest
drawbacks to achieving realistic quotas.
''Give the scientists this boat to assess stocks and they will be a
million miles out because they will go to the wrong place,'' he said.
''It is not fishing but nature which has the biggest effect on
stocks.'' He believes that if the scientific experts go with the
fishermen, who often rely on instinct to lead them to the productive
grounds, more realistic evidence will be found.
The day-trip was going well, apart from the fishing. The net had been
hauled in bulging but the catch included a few sharks, not of the
political variety, and a mixture of species of little commercial worth,
and most were returned to the sea.
The visitors were treated to smoked fish boiled in milk.
Mr Finn believed he had been successful in illuminating the problems
they faced for Mr Robertson.
''It is been a very encouraging meeting,'' he said, ''and I think the
Government is going down the right road.''
There was considerable accord but not on the issue of decommissioning.
It is believed the Government may be prepared to relax the rules
slightly to allow vessels to be decommissioned if they are altered
enough to ensure they can never fish again, but Mr Robertson was adamant
about the rejection of a scrap and build policy which the industry is
demanding.
He made it clear that until the fleet is reduced in size the
Government will not turn its attention to modernising it.
As the Gleaner headed back to Campbeltown, with Cecil Finn filleting
freshly caught haddock to give the Minister a tangible reminder of the
trip, his son summed up Scotland's fishermen's case.
''All we want is a fair chance,'' he said. ''No advantages, no
disadvantages -- just a fair chance to earn our living.''

A SCOTTISH Office Minister yesterday lectured a Labour MP over his
claims about the ''horrendous'' problem of the increasing number of
pupils being excluded from Scottish schools for bad behaviour.
Mr Raymond Robertson, Scottish Education Minister, said the figure of
25,000 exclusions in 1992-93 used by Cunninghame South MP Brian Donohoe
was given to him by the Scottish Office.
''In short, the 25,000 figure is not a new one and I am surprised at
you for suggesting that it is,'' Mr Robertson said.
The Labour MP has also claimed that the number of suspensions or
expulsions of pupils had increased by more than 100% in some regions
since 1992-93.
In a response issued yesterday in a letter to the MP, the Education
Minister said: ''We have already taken action to address the problem of
exclusions from Scottish schools.''
Responding to calls on the matter by Mr Donohoe, Mr Robertson said a
circular had been issued in June last year, requiring schools to collect
information because of Scottish Office concerns on the matter.
The information, on authorised and unauthorised absence, including
separate categories for temporary and permanent exclusions, was
collected by all education authorities for the first time during the
school session 1994-95, Mr Robertson said.
It is expected that the results will be published in a report by the
Audit Unit of HM Inspectors of Schools by the end of this year.
The first Audit Unit report on attendance and absence, published in
January, 1995, did not contain separate information on exclusions.
Mr Robertson also pointed out that the Scottish Office at that time
commissioned a two-year project, costing #82,000, to deal with the
problems leading to exclusion. Local authorities had been invited to
contribute to the cost but declined to do so, he said.
He told the MP: ''Given your obvious concerns, you might like to take
this particular matter up with regional councils -- including your own
in Strathclyde.''
Mr Robertson said he would consider what further steps were necessary
when the study results were known next autumn.
Mr Donohoe said last night that the Scottish Office should not try to
''personalise the issue'' but speed up the examination of the problem.

I read that 'Lee has lost his chance to study medicine'. I was robbed
of that long ago
I made a clear and conscious decision to enrol at school as it was the
only course of action
LET ME state first of all that I did supply Dundee University with
false information when I applied for entry to the medical course in
1994. Specifically, I presented myself as Brandon Lee, ne June 4, 1977,
whereas I was in fact born on June 3, 1963, and christened Brian Lachlan
MacKinnon.
I originally left school (Bearsden Academy) after my fifth year in
1980 and went up to Glasgow University to study medicine. I was happy
and I felt sure that medicine was the right path for me.
I cannot remember an exact date, but I remember that it was in the
winter of 1980 that I began to feel unwell. At first, I thought it was
some minor flu bug, but on the very few occasions that I had had flu, I
had usually felt heavy-headed for a couple of days, then taken a Disprin
and sweated it out of my system. However, these symptoms progressed
differently. I was thirsty much of the time; I was losing weight (almost
three stones until my lowest ebb). Increasingly I could concentrate on
neither book learning nor conversation; and most memorably of all I
seemed to want to sleep much of the time.
I remember first infectious mononucleosis and then a virus called
coxsackie being mentioned by my GP, but I do not believe that any blood
test was undertaken during that period. In any case, I chose, perhaps
mistakenly, to keep my head down and try and get on with things. I felt
that by broaching such a matter with my adviser of studies, in my first
year, would do me no favours.
In the summer term of the 1980/81 academic year, I failed all three of
my first MB Ch B Professional examinations. At that time, I felt
seriously unwell for the first time in my life and I was not sure what
would become of me. I think that what helped me most was being called to
the then Dean's office. He read me glowing excerpts from my school
report, smiled kindly, and told me to go off and show what I could
really do. His name was (Professor) McGirr, but mostly I remember his
eyes; old and wise and benign and framed under bushy eyebrows.
For the duration of the summer, I timetabled myself to take as much
sleep as I might. Beyond that, I devoted all the time I could to forcing
myself to study. Whereas before, I had been quick to learn, I now found
it almost impossible to focus on anything; but I was inspired by what
this old man had said and how he had said it. In September, I passed all
three resit examinations.
Shortly afterwards, and before the second year began, I have a vivid
recollection of being driven to Loch Fyne with my family. I am only very
occasionally given to strong emotion, but I remember crying to myself
when I saw the sea and the hills. I realised that I had seen neither all
summer and my heart felt low and I was sure that I would die.
However, I did not die. I sense that what saved me was that the
experience of the summer had somehow broken my will, thereby whatever
pathology afflicted me was able to run its course and eventually be
dealt with by my immune system, itself now unhindered by the stress of
self-concern.
I became like a zombie, still losing weight, enervated, and sleeping
for long periods.
From more or less the beginning of the second year I could not attend
classes. I do not remember much about the following year to 18 months,
although the memory of a few events stay with me. At one point I was
asked for an interview with the new Dean, Professor Jennett, and the
Adviser of Studies, Dr Holmes. Physically, it was a tremendous effort to
leave my house and go and see them, but I managed it; perhaps motivated
by the expectation that having seen how I actually was (and not just the
report from my GP) they would afford me the leave that I required to
recover.
It was immediately apparent to me that their adopted position was
quite in contrast to my expectations. They were aggressively
unsympathetic. What marks that interview out as one of the worst
experiences of my life -- worse even than the position in which I now
find myself -- is the frustration at not being able to defend myself
against the verbal equivalent of being set upon by hyenas. Before
becoming unwell, I had always been blessed with quick wits and strong
articulation; but these qualities were far removed from me at that time.
All I remember clearly was their repeated demand for me to withdraw
from the course and my oft-repeated ''No!''. In fairness to them, they
may have thought, on the basis of my lack of lucidity, that they were
dealing with a simpleton; but they surely knew that I was not well. They
were nevertheless insistent that if I did not voluntarily withdraw from
the medical course, I would be excluded on the spot with no chance of
future re-admission.
Unable to tolerate any more browbeating, I eventually signed the
document that they had put in front of me. Thereafter, I was shunted
first to a clinician (Mr Brebner), then a psychiatrist (Mr Cheyne), and
finally, far from fully recovered, I was excluded from medicine.
Some time later, I remember seeing another psychiatrist (suggested to
me, I believe, by a local politician -- I pursued as many avenues as I
might to redress the decision to exclude me) in order to try to gain
some manner of restoration of my position, following its dismemberment
by the university psychiatrist.
I had to travel by train to near Edinburgh in order to meet this man.
I do not recall his name but what he promised to be a most favourable
re-evaluation of my mental state is probably still on record at Glasgow
University Medical Faculty. I seem to recall that it was with him that I
discussed my horror at labelling me obsessional.
Words, used skilfully, are tremendously powerful. Indeed I, myself, am
using them as best as I might here, in some tenuous (and probably
forlorn) hope that I might hold to the path that I feel, so strongly, is
right for me; however, few words hold such sway in our culture as do
psychiatric terms. Their connotations for the lay person are potent and
if one is even known to have visited (or in my case, in the first
instance, to have been, most conveniently, ''sent to'') a psychiatrist,
one is thereafter precluded from much.
The detail of our conversation now elude me, but I trust that I made
it manifestly clear to him that I was not interested in trying to ''be
someone'' -- Dr, Mr, Professor, or whatever -- I simply felt that in
considering my talents and my strong vocation to somehow help others
some area of medical practice was the destination towards which I ought
to head.
Three years later, in 1986, while working as a library assistant at
Glasgow University main library I heard that the university science
faculty had a dearth of applications. I took no pleasure in my work, but
I performed it diligently, and the head librarian was kind enough to
write me a glowing report, when I went for interview at the Science
Faculty.
I undertook the science degree (financing myself without grant for the
first two years) with the sole aim in view of performing well enough to
re-route back into medicine at the earliest opportunity, either at
Glasgow or elsewhere.
With the advantage of hindsight, I realise that this was foolhardy. In
previously refusing to acquiesce to the combined wills of Professor
Jennett and those around him, I had contributed to a situation in which
my name was mud. In any case, I performed very well throughout the first
two years, gaining certificates of merit (some first class), where
available. I had one fail in the third term of second year, in half
Higher Ordinary Chemistry.
Sometime before the exam, the chemistry department had encouraged me
to enter an essay competition run by Spillers Foods and open to all
undergraduates studying science subjects in British universities. I
suppose I spent too much time on researching and writing the essay and
somewhat neglected to study for what seemed to be a minor examination.
In any case, I passed the resit with flying colours and won (jointly)
the essay competition. I received #500 and had it published in Food
Science and Technology Today.
Despite my academic record and glowing reports from the science
faculty adviser of studies I still received no offers of a place in any
of the medical schools to which I applied. At the end of the second year
I applied to specialise in immunology, beginning the following term. I
imagined that this might be the subject most commensurate with going on
to study medicine. I was however, refused a place. The reason given was
that despite an otherwise outstanding academic record, I had failed half
Higher Ordinary Chemistry and it was not departmental policy to accept
students who had failed in any subject.
Hence, with third year soon to begin, I found myself with no place in
any course. I almost walked away at that point. However, via a meeting
with Dr Lackie, a cell biologist, I was introduced to Professor Whaley,
who ran the then newly-offered Experimental Pathology course. He was
glad to offer me a place. At the end of the third year one is simply
told whether one has passed or failed (no merit system). I passed.
Still, there came no interviews or offers of a place in medicine from
any of the schoools to which I applied.
In the fourth year, I applied again to Glasgow and other universities
and I think that it was in that year that Glasgow finally asked me for
interview. The aforementioned reality of my name being ''mud'' had long
since dawned upon me and my hopes of readmission were diminishing.
Today, I read from Wednesday's Herald, the headline '' 'Lee' has lost
his chance to study medicine''. I was robbed of that chance a long time
ago .
Approximately one month before my final exams I discovered upon
visiting the faculty office that my application had been unsuccessful. I
had not even received a letter from them. At that point I did give up
and informed Professor Whaley of my decision. Professor MacSween, the
head of pathology, called me at home soon afterwards and was insistent
that I take the finals, as a first or an upper second would yet provide
me with the possibility of going on to study medicine.
I took his advice and felt very good about my performance in the
finals. Immediately afterwards, by way of winding down, I went climbing
in Skye and then in the far North of Scotland (Ben Hope) with three
friends.
Upon calling home one day, my mother told me that Professor MacSween
had called and wanted to see me. At interview, he told me that there was
a problem with the comprehension of my handwriting in one of my papers.
I thought he was joking at first and that he had really called me to
discuss something else. However, he seemed to be in earnest. I conceded
that I had been up late studying the night before and I may have been a
little tired, but there was surely no way my handwriting could not be
read.
Later, Professor Whaley spoke with my mother on the telephone and said
that aside from this point of contention, much else of my work in the
exam was of the standard of a good first.
Later in the summer of 1990, our car was hit by a driver who had been
drinking. My grandmother lost her eye and died 12 days later, my mother
had three fractured ribs. I had whiplash and was largely housebound for
some months.
During that time, I considered what else I might do with my life, but
nothing would come to me except to try to study medicine abroad. I
enrolled in a biosciences B Sc course at Caledonian University. I
performed well and Dr Kinsman, who organised the course, wrote me a
report. I applied to many universities around the world. Two showed
interest, but no firm offers were forthcoming.
During the spring of 1991 my father began to have problems with
swallowing his food. He was treated by his GP for indigestion, but the
problem worsened to the point where he could no longer retain his food.
At my mother's insistence, he was sent for tests at Glasgow's Western
Infirmary. There, a stricture was discovered and his oesophagus was
widened by mechanical means. The pathology report (of the biopsy) from
the department where I used to study came back negative. My father was
sent home and my mother told to stop worrying, as ''there was absolutely
nothing wrong with him''.
As you know, I have no medical qualifications (although I did study
oncology, as part of the experimental pathology course), but even I
could see that there was something seriously wrong with him. One week
later, my father was again sent for tests at the Western accompanied by
a letter from his GP ('' . . . at the insistence of his wife I am
sending him for re-examination''). The following day we were told that
he had cancer of the oesophagus. One can only conclude that the
diagnosis had been missed first time around.
A prognosis of three months' survival time was intimated to my mother
-- he died 11 months later. With respect to what I have done since then
I feel that there are three events relating to this episode which
provided me with the impetus to proceed as I did.
In the first instance, I lived with my parents in a sheltered housing
complex at 15 Jedworth Court in Bearsden, after I returned from Canada.
There my mother worked for some 16 years as warden. When the dosage of
morphine given to control my father's pain was increased to a level
where he became bedridden, we converted the downstairs room, adjacent to
the living-room, into a bedroom for him. The onset of my father's
illness coincided with the time of my mother's retirement. Shortly
before his becoming bedridden they were offered a flat up two flights of
stairs. At this time my father, who had already had a hip replacement,
could walk on flat ground only with difficulty. Stairs were
insurmountable.
Soon afterwards representatives of Strathclyde Regional Council came
to visit my mother. I was sitting by my father's bed and through the
thin walls I overheard them serve an eviction notice on her -- this in
spite of her having, earlier in the conversation, explained that my
father was dying of cancer. As it was, she later successfully resisted
the eviction action at Dumbarton Sheriff Court and won reasonable
accommodation at 11 Whitehurst. My father died before he moved here.
In the second instance, my mother was concerned that my dad should not
be told bluntly of his prospects. There was little doubt that he knew
his cancer was inoperable (a bypass tube was fitted around part of his
oesophagus, as a temporary measure), but having been married to him for
more than 40 years she knew how his plight should be managed.
The consultant surgeon was sensitive to this, but when she phoned to
discuss the matter with one of the GPs in the local practice he was
adamant that any inquiry from my father, as his condition worsened,
would meet with a forthright response.
These first two events moved me to consider that the so-called
''caring'' professions -- my mother worked for the social services
department of SRC -- were populated by many people who were neither
caring, nor particularly professional.
I determined to make one last attempt to study for a medical degree;
however, aged 29 and with my particular background I realised that there
was no realistic possibility of my so doing in straightforward fashion.
It was at that point that I undertook to employ essentially dishonest
means to achieve this purpose.
''Falsification'' always has an unsavoury ring to it. I was willing to
falsify documents in order to clear a way on my chosen path, which had
hitherto been blocked by a bludgeoning and unconcerned system. Medical
ethics, however, constitute a code of conduct for those who have been
afforded a fair opportunity (as I believe I have not) to complete their
medical studies.
My resolve along these lines was consolidated by a third important
event during this time.
Shortly before morphine finally robbed him of his ability to
elucidate, my father started to speak to me about confidence. He was
rambling somewhat, but he said that he had never lost confidence, except
once. It was the morning after the Cheapside whisky bond disaster when,
as a fireman coming on early duty, he discovered some of his friends'
bodies in the aftermath of the explosion.
Our natures were so different in several ways that I could not fully
understand what he meant. I asked him if he thought that I might yet
fulfil some purpose in life which was meaningful for me. He replied: ''I
think that everybody has their day''. To the outside listener this might
have been interpreted as meaning that I had already had mine. But I
would stress that I was intensely cognisant that I was having my final
conversation with my Dad and hence I was listening more with my heart
than my ears. I saw with clarity that I should proceed with this idea
that I had been entertaining. Much of the rest is a matter of record.
There remain of course a number of points which I feel obliged to
clear up:
(A) I made a clear and conscious decision to re-enrol at school as I
felt it was the only course of action left open to me to resume my
studies in medicine.
(B) Of the secondaries within reasonable commuting distance none
seemed interested in taking pupils from outwith their catchment area.
With May drawing to a close I had no option but to return to my original
school.
(C) I do not possess two passports, I did not have a brawl in a
Tenerife bar, and I was not and have never been arrested.
I am truly sorry for any adverse effect caused by me to the university
and Bearsden Academy. I appreciate the kindness shown me both at the
school and at Dundee University. My family have been, and as I write,
still are, under siege by the media -- I was on holiday abroad when this
story broke and returned as soon as I could -- and to put an end to this
I have decided to speak to one newspaper -- for no payment.

A 72-YEAR-OLD former Royal Marine, recuperating in Scotland after a
cancer operation, has had his #100,000 home south of the Border sold
without his knowledge because of a loophole in the English land
registration system.
The case of Frank Higgins, who is staying with a friend in
Burntisland, Fife, has concerned lawyers and police in England.
The saga of the house in South Wonston, Hampshire, began when Mr
Higgins developed cancer during a holiday in Scotland. He moved in with
his fiancee, Ella Millar, 68, to recuperate.
During his time away, a man calling himself Frank Higgins swore a
statutory declaration before a lawyer claiming he was the true owner of
the house in Downs Road but had lost the deeds.
That declaration was sent to the Land Registry which had no record of
the property because it had not changed hands since compulsory
registration of properties on sale came into force.
Land Registry officials registered the title and issued the false Mr
Higgins with a land certificate. That enabled him to sell the property.
When details of the sale were discovered, it was not ruled invalid
because there was no evidence that the buyer was aware of the fraud.
Under the Land Registration Act, once an innocent buyer gets his title
registered the record cannot normally be changed.
Hampshire Police are trying to trace the false Frank Higgins to charge
him with criminal deception, but admit that they have a difficult job in
tracking him down.
The real Mr Higgins, who now lives in a flat overlooking the Firth of
Forth, said: ''I am absolutely furious at what has happened. I built
that house in 1961 and considered it my main home.
''It was always furnished and in good condition but because of my
cancer operation I could not get back to it over the past few years.
''I am very, very angry at what has gone on. The false Mr Higgins must
have battered the door down to get in in the first place so he could
show it to prospective buyers.
''There is a terrible failing in the Land Registry system in England
and I have been told that luckily such a thing could not happen in
Scotland because the system is different.''
Mr Donald Reid, a lecturer in conveyancing at Glasgow University, said
it was unlikely that such a case would arise in Scotland since the
Keeper of the Register of Titles would demand to see the existing land
certificate from the genuine owner before registering change of
ownership.
''It would appear that there must be the risk of the same thing
happening here, but it is extremely remote,'' he said.

THE European Commission now looks likely to make some kind of
pronouncement on the controversial Skye Bridge which is due to open in
three weeks.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the EU Transport Commissioner, has agreed to meet two
Highland MPs to discuss whether the establishment of the private
enterprise project breaches any European legislation.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye,
and Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, made the
approach to Mr Kinnock during the parliamentary summer recess after a
meeting of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, which brings together all
strands of opposition to the bridge.
The MPs specifically want to explore with Mr Kinnock the question of
imposing a monopoly bridge with no competition on the island communities
and also to ascertain the EU's attitude to a competing ferry service.
The meeting will be held in Brussels or London as soon as possible.
In a joint statement, the MPs said: ''We very much welcome Neil
Kinnock's positive response. Aspects of the project raise serious
questions over European transport policy and deserve top-level
attention. We are glad we have secured that.''
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, secretary of the appeal group, said yesterday:
''Obviously we are delighted that Mr Kinnock has agreed to this meeting.
At long last there is a chance to examine all the questions relating to
the bridge.
''Mr Kinnock, for example, might want to know why it is that the
British Government fought to get the Highlands and islands recognised as
one of the poorest areas in Europe, having decided to charge them the
highest bridge tolls in Europe.
''He might want to know why a so-called free enterprise bridge can
only pay for itself if the Government ensures it has a monopoly. He
might ask whether the Government had any right to promise Miller/Dywidag
that monopoly. They could ensure their own CalMac ferry ceased to run,
but can they stop anybody else running a service? How does this all sit
with European law?''
Meanwhile, a Scottish Office spokesman said that if the MPs wanted to
talk to Mr Kinnock at this stage, it was up to them. ''As regards the
ferry, the position has been well rehearsed. The CalMac service will be
withdrawn, but in principle there is nothing to preclude another
operator starting up. They would, of course, have to get all the
necessary certificates and agreements with the local authority for
access to the slipways.''

RELATIONS between opposition councillors and the Labour leaders of the
new City of Edinburgh Council fell to a new low yesterday following rows
last week about allowances and seats on selection committees.
Liberal Democrat councillors accused ''arrogant'' Labour of treating
the council like ''a private club'' and arranging meetings when it
suited them.
In a motion to be debated at a meeting of the new council's policy
committee later today, the Liberal Democrats deplored ''the high-handed
attitude of the Labour administration in frequently changing the dates
of council meetings without consultation or even timely notification of
opposition councillors''.
Their leader, Councillor Donald Gorrie, said: ''It is unacceptable
that a small clique of Labour councillors treats the City of Edinburgh
Council as a toy they can play with or as some private club that meets
when it suits them.''
He claimed the date of almost every one of the new council's meetings
had been changed and shrouded in confusion.
Opposition Conservatives are currently boycotting selection committees
at the council, which they claim are being packed with Labour
councillors. They have also accused Labour of being greedy over the
distribution of councillors' allowances.

LABOUR put off a decision last night on whether to endorse Liz Davies
as its candidate to fight Leeds North East at the next election, amid
claims by veteran left-wing MP Dennis Skinner of a ''sinister'' campaign
against her.
The national disputes committee met at Labour headquarters in London
to decide whether to back Ms Davies, an Islington councillor, who is at
the centre of a raft of allegations.
Labour officials are said to have drawn up a dossier against her,
including charges that she is on the extreme left and would be unlikely
to follow the Labour whip in Parliament.
Ms Davies -- who mounted a three-hour defence of herself at the
four-hour meeting -- is taking legal advice against the allegations,
which also include court proceedings against her over non-payment of the
poll tax.
Tom Sawyer, Labour's general secretary, said afterwards he believed
the matter would be ''cleared up'' by tomorrow.
''It was a good hearing. We are now in a position to mull over the
information, and hopefully we will produce a report which will be
acceptable to Wednesday's national executive committee.''
Asked whether the party could end up facing court proceedings itself
if it did not support Ms Davies, he said: ''The NEC will have to make a
decision as to whether or not they want to consider legal guidance.''
But Mr Skinner, who attended the meeting, said the case against Ms
Davies should have been thrown out. Asked if the Labour leadership was
against her, he said: ''If they are, it is very sad, because there isn't
a case.''
He said: ''We have now seen, in this dossier, that in her first letter
to the Leeds party, she made it clear that not only did she campaign
against the poll tax, but also she told them she refused to pay it as
well.''
Pressed on whether she mentioned court proceedings taken against her,
he said: ''Of course, it was all in there.
''A video was presented in which it was made clear she would have gone
to court, but remember, it's a civil debt. It is only like someone not
paying their hire purchase arrangements.''
He added: ''In five-and-a-half years, Liz Davies only voted twice
against a Labour whip, once to save a nursery school in Islington. This
is chicken-feed compared to voting against a budget. She is able to
prove that on no single occasion did she vote against a budget in
Islington in five years.
''Neil Kinnock voted 77 times against a Labour government, most of
them in respect of devolution. He finished up as leader.''
A Labour source said: ''I always said at the outset that this was
going to be a very fair hearing and never going to be a kangaroo court,
despite what some people said.
''Today they (the committee) have had a lot of written evidence, a lot
of oral evidence, and have decided that the sensible and fair thing to
do was go away once more, give it a final looking, mull it over, and
meet again at 8am on Wednesday and take a final decision.''
Ms Davies, a 31-year-old barrister specialising in housing law, was
selected at the beginning of July to fight the Tory marginal of Leeds
North East from an all-women shortlist.
Much was made in the media over her facing a 30-day jail sentence in
1991 for her poll tax stand. But she did not serve the sentence after a
friend paid her debt. She subsequently won retractions from newspapers
for claims that she had been convicted of a criminal offence.
Mr Skinner said: ''I don't think, contrary to what I believed before I
heard her, that I would place her on the extreme left of the Labour
party.
''I rather suspect that if she is endorsed, and should be endorsed,
she will probably finish up on the front bench. She was absolutely first
class in her own defence.
''She has never been a member of any far-left organisation throughout
her whole life. There are plenty of Members of Parliament who have
started their merry political careers in the Communist Party . . . but
she has been able to prove she has been a member of nothing but the
Labour Party.''
He said the ''sinister'' aspect of the case was ''whereas two people
in Leeds initially voiced opinions against her, she subsequently
received a vote of 37 to nil by the Leeds constituency Labour party.
''Then we find that the people who are sending in objections are from
Islington, 200 miles away -- people that were at the time councillors
along with Liz Davies.
''On all previous questions on validity of endorsement, it has always
been on the basis of whether the selection process was drawn up in the
correct manner, or whether there were objections from people at the
selection meeting or in the constituency.''
Labour MP Peter Hain said in the weekly Labour newspaper Tribune that
the Liz Davies issue had become a test for New Labour, and he had
written to all members of the NEC urging them to support her.
The MP for Neath, who is also chairman of the Tribune board, said: ''I
have carefully researched this whole story, which must be quite
confusing to most people outside the Labour Party because of all the
McCarthyite smears, but I think the NEC will be left without a shred of
credibility if it finds against Liz Davies.
''This has become a litmus test for New Labour, as to whether
tolerance and honesty will be the guiding principles for the party.''

<HEADLINE>Sir Freddie Laker takes to the skies again</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SIR Freddie Laker, pioneer of cut-price air travel, plans to operate
aircraft across the Atlantic again, including Glasgow flights, it was
announced yesterday.
Thirteen years after other airlines forced his revolutionary Skytrain
service out of the skies, the 73-year-old entrepreneur who brought down
the price of transatlantic air travel is to have a 49% stake in a US
carrier to be called Laker Airways Incorporated.
Spokeswoman Naomi Graham said the airline would take delivery of three
McDonnell Douglas DC10-30 aircraft, the first before Christmas, with the
other two planned for service in January and May next year.
''Start-up operations, subject to government approvals, will be to and
from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale to London Gatwick, Manchester, and
Glasgow in the UK, with Berlin and Milan to follow,'' she said.
''US domestic routes and other international operations are in the
planning stage.''
The new company is 51% owned by Oscar Wyatt, chairman and founder of
Houston oil company the Coastal Corporation, and 49% by Sir Freddie, the
voting rights being 75% and 25% respectively, said the spokeswoman.
Sir Freddie and Mr Wyatt said today: ''We are sure that the long-haul
travel industry is about to boom and this is the ideal time to go on to
the Atlantic.
''The US and European economies are on a positive upswing and there
are millions of potentially new tourists from eastern Europe and the
unification of Germany, which augurs well for the long term.''
Sir Freddie used DC10s for Skytrain, his no-frills service which got
the go-ahead in 1977 and was allegedly driven out of business by rivals

A FATHER who ''ruthlessly'' used his nine-year-old son to taunt his
former lover was told by a sheriff yesterday that he deserved a long
prison sentence.
However, Sheriff Andrew Lothian decided that locking the father up was
not in the boy's best interests.
The 35-year-old man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons,
admitted two charges of stealing his son when he appeared at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court.
He also admitted breach of the peace.
Sheriff Lothian was told that the father had access to his son
following the break-up of the parents' relationship. The father had
pressed his former partner to return after she resumed her relationship
with an ex-husband.
On April 26, the woman and her ex-husband went out, leaving the
nine-year-old with babysitters. The mother was expected home the next
morning.
When the boy awoke, his father was present. Returning at 7.30am, the
boy's mother found a note saying, ''I have my son.''
A meeting was arranged, the court heard. The father met the mother
alone and was restrained by police officers. The boy was found in a car
with another person.
Following a first charge of stealing the boy, the father was permitted
to see the child again. When the boy's return to his mother was delayed
at a later visit, an argument broke out and police were called.
A search of a house revealed the boy hidden under the stairs.
Solicitor Jim Wardlaw said the boy's father now knew that he should
have gone to the proper authorities if he was worried about his son.
These steps have now been taken.
''You have ruthlessly used the child in order to do harm to the woman
you used to live with,'' Sheriff Lothian told the man.
Community service was ordered, bail conditional on the man not seeing
his family was allowed. Sentence was deferred until October 16.

A 14-YEAR-old boy from Stirling, who could face rape charges in
Scotland after a camping holiday on the Costa Brava, returned home
yesterday.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested by the
Spanish Civil Guard after a 15-year-old British girl staying at the same
camp site at the resort of Estartit, north of Barcelona, claimed she had
been raped in a tent.
The girl told police that the attack took place after she had left a
disco.
The boy was held in custody for several days while a judge at the
juvenile court at Gerona, the regional capital, investigated the case. A
report is to be sent to the courts in Stirling.
The alleged victim returned to Britain with her parents immediately
after making her complaint.
Police in Stirling said yesterday they have not yet received a report
of the incident.

THE results of a trial, published today, show that victims of Aids and
HIV infection can be greatly helped by a combination of drugs.
The trial revealed that treatment with AZT, the chief Aids drug, was
far more effective when combined with other drugs.
Using AZT plus either didanosine or zalcitabine had a ''highly
significant health benefit'', the Medical Research Council reports.
Aids victims lived longer and in the case of HIV positive patients the
treatment delayed the onset of the disease.
The reduction in death rate over the course of the trial was 38% for
patients who took two drugs compared with those who took AZT alone.
A total of 3000 people took part in the Delta trial in the UK,
Ireland, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland.
The Terence Higgins Trust, the Aids charity, said: ''This is very good
news for people with HIV and Aids after two years of disappointments and
setbacks. Although we are still a long way from a cure, these results
renew hope, improve current treatment, and encourage researchers looking
at other combinations of drugs.''

A STRUCK-OFF solicitor was fined #1500 yesterday for illegal share
dealing in a football club.
Andrew Drummond, 34, former secretary of Dundee FC, admitted he
contravened the Companies Act.
He did not notify Dundee FC plc of the interests he had in the
company's shares between August 1, 1991, and January 30, 1992.
His companion, Mr Robert Prentice, 35, who lives with him in a mansion
in Forfar, had his not guilty plea to the same charge accepted.
Drummond, of Langlands, Glamis Road, Forfar, was struck off as a
solicitor by the Law Society of Scotland last year.
A discipline tribunal accused him of displaying a ''cavalier
attitude'' towards his clients and told him he was not a fit and proper
person to remain on the solicitors' roll.
In 1991, he bought a 30% share in Dundee FC from millionaire property
developer Angus Cook.
Last year, he and Mr Prentice were ordered by a sheriff to quit their
#250,000 mansion in Forfar for failing to repay #240,257 owed to the
Bank of Scotland.
In yesterday's case, Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Drummond had
already been investigated by the Takeover Panel.
The same complaint was later dealt with by a discipline tribunal of
the Law Society of Scotland and Drummond was fined #8000 and restricted
in share dealing for five years. He has also been found liable for
costs, which are expected to amount to #50,000.
The court was told that in August 1991, Drummond made an offer to Mr
Cook, a director of the company which then had the controlling interest
in the club.
It heard that three companies were set up to avoid takeover rules
where, if someone acquires 30% of the shareholding in a company, an
offer in similar terms has to be made to other shareholders.
The shares were later sold to Canadian businessman Ron Dixon, the
current chairman of Dundee.
Miss Frances McMenanmen, defence advocate, said it was never
Drummond's intention to take over the club completely and he wanted to
get it back on to an even keel when it was facing financial problems.
She said Drummond ''was never in any financial position to make an
offer to the existing shareholders''.
The court heard that Drummond ''made a mistake'' and ''forgot'' about
the Companies Act obligation.
The advocate said Drummond's life was now ruined and the consequences
of forgetting about the Companies Act section had been ''catastrophic''.
She told the court that after four years service as secretary to
Dundee FC, Drummond had been sacked because of the proceedings.
Sheriff Francis Keane fined Drummond #1500.
Drummond is currently appealing the Law Society of Scotland's decision
to strike him off the solicitor's roll and also the judgment where he
was fined #8000.
He declined to comment outside court.

A CAMPAIGN was launched yesterday to encourage families to plan an
escape route in the event of fire. One million leaflets will be
distributed to coincide with the screening of a television commercial
and the start of Fire Safety Week.
Launching the #400,000 campaign, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton said: ''Surveys indicate there is some complacency in
households with smoke alarms, and sometimes a mistaken belief that the
alarm itself provides sufficient protection.
''The television commercial is deliberately emotional and highlights
the consequences of fire as well as demonstrating the suffering and
horror it causes.''
Fire fatalities in Scotland have fallen in the last 10 years, despite
a 30% increase in reported fires.
Although smoke alarms were fitted in 39 of the 92 fatal house fires in
1993, they failed to work in 21 cases because of to missing, dud, or
incorrectly wired batteries.
Strathclyde's firemaster, Mr John Jameson, said: ''There is absolutely
no doubt that smoke alarms have quite dramatically reduced fire deaths
within Strathclyde. Our people attending normal dwelling house fires are
getting called sooner, and there is less damage and less injury
caused.''
He said it was important that people planned in advance in event of
fire and all brigades were making strenuous efforts to improve fire
education and getting householders to check and replace smoke alarm
batteries.
At the launch, deputy firemaster James Coyle said that while 87% of
people now had smoke detectors in their homes, many of these were
useless because their owners were unwilling to meet the cost of
replacing batteries.
''There has been a significant number of fatal fires within
Strathclyde where a smoke detector has been fitted but the battery
removed,'' he said.
''Popular reasons include using it to replace batteries in computer
game consuls and remote controls. I would ask you as a parent or spouse:
Could you suffer the guilt of losing a loved one for the sake of a
battery costing #2?''

THE Princess of Wales has received an official invitation to visit
Argentina and a royal aide said a decision would be taken by the end of
the week on whether she would accept.
Argentine President Carlos Menem has recently renewed his country's
claim to sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, a claim that resulted in
a war between Britain and Argentina in 1982.
An agreement for joint exploration of oil reserves in and around the
Falklands will be signed by the two countries today.
If the princess receives Foreign Office backing, the trip could take
place in October or November. Diana would be the second member of the
royal family to pay an official visit to Argentina since the conflict.
Last year, the Duke of York visited Buenos Aires and Argentine naval
bases during a visit of reconciliation and goodwill.
The princess was welcomed to Paris yesterday by President Jacques
Chirac and called at the Elysee Palace for tea with his wife Bernadette.
Later, the Chiracs accompanied her to an exhibition of paintings by
Cezanne.
The princess dazzled Paris last night as the lady in red, stepping out
in the high-fashion French capital in a daring creation by designer
Christian Lacroix.
Not that she could have chosen any other designer -- for Monsieur
Lacroix was sitting next to her at dinner.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, with boyfriend magician David
Copperfield, rivalled the princess for the attention of the media.
Nevertheless, it was Diana who took centre stage as the guest of
honour at a celebrity dinner that raised more than one million francs
(#130,000) for London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, of
which she is president.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976191844</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CATALOGUE of failings and blunders allowed a schizophrenic free to
kill a man he believed was former gangster Ronnie Kray, a report found
yesterday.
Health workers were singled out for not providing proper care for
Stephen Laudat, 26, who was left without support when he needed it most.
Laudat, who had a conviction for robbery, stabbed to death Mr Bryan
Bennett, a fellow patient at a day centre, eight months after being
released from hospital.
Yesterday's report of an inquiry into the killing said there was no
way of predicting the violent stabbing, but concluded that proper care
would have prevented a relapse.
The Government's care in the community policies were not to blame, it
added.
Rather, a lethal combination of individual error, poor communications,
and chronic underfunding lay behind the tragedy.
Relatives of both families yesterday blamed the Government for the
tragedy and called for more investment into hospital-based care.
The independent inquiry, which criticised the level of psychiatric
care Laudat received for a number of years, was commissioned by East
London and The City Health Authority, and Newham Council, east London.
Mr Len Woodley, QC, chairman of the inquiry, said Laudat should have
received psychiatric help in 1991 at the time of his first conviction.
When he did get psychiatric care at the private Kneesworth House
Hospital in Cambridgeshire, this was described as ''barely adequate''.
It was followed by a communications breakdown between health and
social workers, where ''the right hand did not know what the left hand
was doing''.
The report concluded: ''Our main criticism over the period of Stephen
Laudat's care and treatment in the community is that attempts to provide
him with good social care were undermined by inadequate health care.
''Although there were deficiencies in all services, we were impressed
by the approach, commitment and sensitivity shown to Stephen Laudat by
two inexperienced and unqualified social workers. This was not matched,
or supported by more experienced health colleagues.''
It also blamed pressures on staff, who were working in a period of
organisational change. Poor administrative systems, inexperience, and a
lack of effective joint working were also said to be factors.
The council, which ran the centre where Laudat and Mr Bennett were
patients, said it ''deeply regretted'' the incident.
Mr Kevin Jenkins, chairman of its social services committee, said the
problems stretched back to the 1970s.
He added that Newham was hampered by ''inadequate funding'' from the
Government for NHS and local authority services.
Mr Peter Coe, general manager of East London and The City Health
Authority, said it was now recognised that mental health services had
traditionally been underdeveloped in Newham.
Care in secure units was being expanded and there had been a review of
day-to-day management procedures at the centre.
Joint training of health and social services staff was being developed
and more medical staff and community psychiatric nurses were employed.
Laudat's father blamed the Government for the events that turned his
son into a killer.
Angelo Laudat, 53, said his condolences went out to Mr Bennett's
family -- but it was a tragedy that could have been avoided.
''My son and Mr Bennett were both victims of a community care policy
that has failed both those in need of care and the wider community.''
Kim Bennett, the victim's daughter, called on the Government to pump
more cash into caring for the mentally ill.
She told a news conference that more attention was given to killers
than victims and their families.

TRIPLE killer Jason Mitchell fooled psychiatrists about his mental
state before he was set free to murder, an inquiry heard yesterday.
After his arrest, he appeared to be in a state of ecstasy and sang in
his cell about life being wonderful.
Mitchell, 24, a paranoid schizophrenic, is serving three life
sentences in Rampton top-security psychiatric hospital after admitting
murdering his father and an elderly couple last December.
The inquiry, at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, is examining the quality of
care and control he received from 1990 until he absconded from an
intensive psychiatric treatment unit at St Clement's Hospital, Ipswich,
last December.
Mitchell convinced doctors and a judge he was fit enough to return to
the community.
He was sent to St Clement's but absconded and strangled pensioners
Shirley and Arthur Wilson, both 65, and later killed and dismembered his
father, Mr Bob Mitchell, in his home village of Bramford, Suffolk.
Mitchell had been in trouble from his school days. In 1989 he attacked
a church cleaner at Epsom and was sent to a hospital under the Mental
Health Act at the Old Bailey.
By May 1994, consultants thought his condition had improved enough to
allow him into the community under care.
The decision was backed by the Home Office and he was sent to a
community home in Felixstowe.
Last November, he returned to St Clement's. He disappeared on December
9 and went to his father's home.
Three days later, he strangled the Wilsons and five days after that he
strangled his father and dismembered the body. He was arrested in the
house on December 20.
Dr Christie Brown, who appeared as an independent witness, said
Mitchell's ability to convince professionals he was normal was
''strikingly unusual and exceptional''.
After one interview a psychiatrist described him as calm, polite,
coherent, and apparently free from any objective evidence of psychotic
illness.
The inquiry continues.

A DAMNING report by Government health watchdogs accuses Greater
Glasgow Health Board of errors in partnership arrangements with the
private sector for the care of old and demented patients.
According to the Scottish Health Advisory Service, which visited the
five partnership nursing homes earlier this year, the homes are too big
and the staffing levels too low.
Although there is no suggestion that patients were being neglected,
the visiting team learned that some gravely-ill patients were being
transferred abruptly to the nursing homes from hospital and dying within
a few days.
A number of the criticisms were intimated to the health board at its
monthly meeting last week.
However, the full version of the report, obtained by The Herald,
ranges wider than the board minutes, and questions the very concept of
the 30-bed houses provided.
During their visit, the SHAS team concluded that the older
institutions which had received so much criticism had been replaced by
new institutions within the community.
''The buildings are of a pleasant design, however the large home
concept does not meet the need for small, domestic-style accommodation,
particularly for people suffering from dementia.
''We believe that 30-bed units of care are too large for the delivery
of high-quality continuing care.''
The board had explained its reasons for entering the partnerships and
the SHAS commended the board for achieving in each case a very much
better standard of accommodation for patients.
''Nevertheless, we believe that health boards need to consider other
alternatives, particularly for the care of people with dementia.''
The present staffing and skill mix in these homes was lower than any
NHS-provided continuing-care services visited by the Advisory Service in
the last two years, says the report.
Some managers had told the SHAS team that the staffing level specified
in their contracts were based on Scotmeg Action Plan 27 -- a series of
recommendations produced by the Scottish Health Management Efficiency
Group which appear to have been on the low side -- but this had been
denied by the health board.
Whatever the basis for the present staffing levels, concerns had been
expressed by nurses about the increasing level of dependency of
patients, a ''predictable consequence'' of increasing care in the
community and more rigorous standards for admission to NHS continuing
care.
''Although we found no direct evidence of deficiency of care we
recommend that the health board and the homes should review staffing,
particularly on those houses that care for people with dementia,'' says
the report.
Some staff gave a clear impression that they felt they were having to
care for patients whose level of dependency was too high.
The report also criticises the level of input from paramedical
services, such as occupational therapy and physiotherapy.
''We consider that the health board needs to pay more attention to its
partnerships. The contracts need to be more effectively monitored.
''We are aware of differences of opinion on the level of care required
by the contract. This will have to be resolved by the board and its
partners.''
The arrangements for the transfer of patients from geriatric
assessment wards to continuing care in the nursing homes were not
satisfactory in all homes. The SHAS group had also been told of patients
transferred with inadequate clinical information.
''We received comment on the latter point from every home and believe
that the matter needs to be considered.''
It was clear from the contracts that there should be a discussion
between the consultant and home manager prior to transfer. This was not
happening.
''Due to the high levels of dependency of the patients and the minimal
staffing levels, ''The quality of individualised care, the report
concludes, may be difficult to sustain.''
The five Glasgow partnership homes, supplying a total of 540 beds are
Darnley Court (ANS Homes Ltd), Rodgerpark and Rowantree in Rutherglen
(Takare), Fourhills, Ruchill (Westminster Healthcare), and Greenfield
Park, Shettleston (St Andrews).

SCOTLAND's status as a nation and the right of its citizens to
question Westminster rule are to be considered by the European Court of
Human Rights, following a remarkable breakthrough in the long-running
campaign by activist Robbie the Pict.
The European Court has satisfied itself that the case is not frivolous
and has allocated case number 28582 to ''Robbie the Pict versus the
United Kingdom''.
Commissioners of the court will examine his challenge to the
legitimacy of the Act of Union and the question of the absolute
sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament.
Robbie, more usually addressed in official correspondence as R T Pict
Esq, has been happy to play a role of a figure of fun on the nationalist
fringe for almost two decades. However, he has always contended that
there was a serious point behind his efforts.
He spotted several years ago that whereas English criminal appeals can
go to the House of Lords, appellants north of the Border can go only as
far as the Supreme Courts in Edinburgh.
Any human rights appeal to the European Court must first have been
taken to the the supreme national authority, so for the Government to
defend itself it will be forced to declare Scotland a European nation.
''Either we are recognised as a nation, or we are allowed to question
Westminster sovereignty and breaches in the Treaty of Union at the House
of Lords, which frankly is likely to be much more productive than
talking to the provincial lackies of a colonial legal system in
Edinburgh,'' he said.
Robbie the Pict, who lives in Lochearnhead, has challenged Westminster
on a number of grounds for years, most notably his refusal to pay road
tax.
Now his legal case has cleared a hurdle intended to ''weed out
loonies, eccentrics, and time-wasters''.
He also successfully resisted an objection that his case was
time-barred, pointing out that otherwise it would have to have been
brought by November 1707.
His claim to Strasbourg is based on Article 4 of the European
Convention of Human Rights, stating that no-one may be held in servitude
(of which he claims ''political bondage'' under an invalidated Union
amounts to a permanent form) and Article 13, concerning the right of
appeal on human rights to a national authority.
Robbie the Pict claims that since a ruling by Lord Campbell in 1852
the Scots courts have declared themselves powerless against Westminster
sovereignty.
''In effect, I am debunking this whole Disneyland myth that Scotland
has an independent legal system,'' he said yesterday.
He said he had been content for years to be marginalised as a figure
of fun because it made clear that he was no kind of threatening
terrorist, but his legal advances showed that ''while the UK authorities
are playing snap, I have been playing a game of chess''.
He said he had told Strasbourg: ''I want respect for the fact that as
an independent individual I have the right to contract out of a treaty
that has been invalidated by breach.''

THE Government was forced on to the defensive last night as a senior
Tory back bencher appeared to support Labour proposals to impose a
windfall tax on public utilities.
The intervention of Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee,
came after Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown disclosed that since
privatisation half of all water companies in England and Wales had paid
no mainstream corporation tax.
Sir Marcus, MP for Shipley in Yorkshire, told Channel Four News: ''I
am not in the business of introducing new taxes, but what I am saying is
that the shareholders have done quite well. There are a number of people
at the top of all these utilities who have ought to have known better --
who have given privatisation a bad name.
''The feeling is that the consumer has been left behind.
''I would not be opposed, if it was felt to be the right thing to do
by the Chancellor, to just introduce some windfall tax for him to use to
the benefit of a lot of people.''
Earlier, Mr Brown had said that since privatisation the industry had
paid just #107m in corporation tax on profits in excess of #7800m -- a
tax rate of 1.36%.
He claimed there was a loophole which had allowed the water companies
to offset most of their tax liabilities, and offered this as further
justification for Labour plans to introduce a one-off windfall tax on
excess profits.
The Shadow Chancellor's point is so far directed at the English water
companies and does not apply to Scotland, but his department will be
looking at any comparable situation for utilities north of the Border.
The Scottish electricity companies, for example, so far are in the
clear but the situation will be kept under scrutiny by Mr Brown's
office.
Mr Brown told a Westminster news conference that five of the 10 water
companies -- Anglian, North-west, South-west, Thames, and Yorkshire, had
yet to pay any mainstream corporation tax -- currently 33% -- according
to their latest annual reports.
Although the industry had paid out a total of #615m in advance
corporation tax since privatisation, Labour estimated #580m of that
could be offset against future tax liabilities.
While refusing to comment on details of what might be in the November
Budget, it was clear that Ministers were having to react to concern over
how public money is being used.
As both Downing Street and the Treasury were forced on to the back
foot, Mr Michael Jack, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, last night
issued a statement which illustrated Government thinking and tried to
turn the tables on Labour.
He said: ''We will not comment one way or another on windfall
utilities tax or any other tax proposals in the run-up to the Budget.
''I will, however, comment on what this means for Labour's public
spending proposals. Gordon Brown has put forward a one-off measure which
he claims is a sensible way to raise revenue for one year only.
''He cannot say this would even begin to meet the cost of Labour's
plans for several billions of pounds worth of higher public spending.
Labour will always spend more than us and they will always have to tax
more than us -- not just for one year but year after year.''
The City reacted nervously to the Labour proposals, with shares in
several of the privatised companies falling back during trading on the
stock market.
The Water Services Association, representing the water companies,
said: ''The industry is investing twice as much as it makes in profits
and this is why it pays little in the way of corporation tax.''

In an exclusive interview with The Herald, he said frustration and
anger at being ''robbed'' of his place studying medicine at Glasgow
University, while he was an 18-year-old, prompted him to embark on the
elaborate hoax.
At his home in Bearsden, surrounded by the textbooks which he is
unlikely ever to need again, he said: ''I felt devastated. I felt as
though I had been robbed and cheated out of my place at university.
''Ironically I later tried to cheat my way in. This was all about
regaining that stolen opportunity.''
Offering a full apology to Dundee University and his old school,
Bearsden Academy, he added: ''I am truly sorry for any adverse effect
caused by me. I appreciate the kindness shown me both at the school and
at Dundee University.
''My family have been, and as I write still are, under siege by the
media -- I was on holiday abroad when this story broke and returned as
soon as I could -- and to put an end to this I have decided to speak to
one newspaper for no payment.''
He confirmed concocting the new persona of Brandon Lee and creating a
totally new identity for himself after he exhausted every avenue in
pursuit of the medical career he craved, including seeking to enrol in a
medical school in Canada.
''I determined to make one last attempt to study for a medical
degree,'' he revealed. ''However, aged 29 and with my particular
background I realised that there was no realistic possibility of my so
doing in straightforward fashion. It was at that point that I undertook
to employ essentially dishonest means to achieve this purpose.
'' 'Falsification' always has an unsavoury ring to it. I was willing
to falsify documents in order to clear a way on my chosen path, which
had hitherto been blocked by a bludgeoning and unconcerned system.''
However, Glasgow University authorities remain confident they took the
correct decision regarding Mr MacKinnon and that he exhausted every
appeals procedure open to him.
He failed his first year exams but was admitted to second year after
passing his resits. In his second year he suffered from a debilitating
illness and could not complete the year. However, in the 1982-83 session
he completed that year, but failed his exams and his resits. The medical
faculty then took the decision to discontinue his studies.
Some years later he returned to Glasgow University to take a science
degree as a means of resuming his medical studies but he reveals he
deliberately did not go to find out his results. Despite completing the
BSc (Hons) course, he did not gain a good enough degree to reapply for
medicine.
Facing the prospect of a future without medicine, Brian MacKinnon also
describes why despite all the obvious risks he chose to return to his
old school to start again on the traditional route to his goal. In doing
so he sought to discard 15 years and assume a new identity which he kept
from his mother, who believed he had gone back to school as an adult
returner.
''Circumstances had a funnelling effect and all roads seemed to lead
to Bearsden Academy, which for obvious reasons would not have been my
choice. I had been there before and I knew there were teachers that had
been there before as well.''
When he went to the school, he reveals that he was intensely nervous
when he was interviewed.
''I was aware of the possibility of being caught at all times but I
had made a conscious decision this was the only way forward for me.
''I thought it could go wrong but I didn't get any bad vibes. I had
already made the decision to go through with this and there wasn't time
for internal debate.''
In the event his year at the school, went ''surprisingly well'' and
culminated in his gaining sufficient qualifications for entry to Dundee
University's medical school.
''The whole year went surprisingly smoothly and at times I was quite
at ease. There was no sense of a Peter Pan situation where I was
actively enjoying myself. Had I somehow by magic been presented with the
opportunity of bypassing school and going straight to medical school I
would gladly have grasped it with both hands.
''I was never comfortable with the role I was playing but I managed to
put it to the back of my mind by concentrating on my work. I wanted to
perform well but I had to keep my foot off the accelerator to a certain
degree because I didn't want to end up in the newspaper for having won
prizes or stood out from the others.''
His double life eventually started to come apart only much later, when
a parcel for Brandon Lee from Dundee University was delivered to a
neighbour's home in Bearsden.
