INSURANCE giant Commercial Union yesterday reported almost doubled
profits for 1994 and further relieved fears of cut-throat competition in
the industry.
The company was also bullish about recent acquisition Groupe
Victoire's future impact on earnings.
Particularly strong profits growth in general insurance, which
accounted for 64% of premiums, helped the group increase pre-tax
earnings from continuing operations to #413m from #218m.
The bottom-line pre-tax figure, after a loss on termination of
activities, was #402m (#211m).
Total dividend, after a final payout of 16.29p and adjustment for a
rights issue during the year, was up 8% at 26.4p.
The City was impressed by results which lived up to expectations and
Commercial Union shares put on 10p to 515p in a broadly unchanged
sector.
General insurance profits rose 86% to #347m worldwide, with UK
earnings nearly doubling to #220m.
UK underwriting earned #63m, after a #55m loss the previous year, with
branch operations' profits of #145m offset by losses of #82m in the
London market, principally from old business. Investment income was
slightly lower at #157m.
The overall UK result was helped by higher premiums, better claims
experience and favourable weather conditions. Last year's loss included
#21m attributable to bomb damage in London.
Chief executive John Carter said underwriting conditions in most major
overseas markets continued to improve and, while the UK had seen an
increase in competition during the year, there was nothing to indicate
that an excessive level was developing.
Stockbroker James Capel believes some other analysts' fears of
cut-throat competition in the sector have failed to materialise.
It predicts ''very healthy'' operating results for insurers in
1995-96, accompanied by solid dividend growth, and believes the recent
recovery in their share prices will continue.
The results of French-based Groupe Victoire were consolidated from
September 13. During the four months, it earned life profits of #25m but
incurred a loss of #14m in general insurance operations.
Its addition will increase the life portion of Commercial Union's
total premiums to 40% on a full-year basis.
Looking ahead, Mr Carter said: ''The acquisition of the life and
general insurance business of Groupe Victoire has significantly expanded
the scope of our operations. It is expected to improve the quality of
the group's earnings and support our objective of providing shareholders
with real dividend growth on a sustained basis.''
The general insurance side of Groupe Victoire's business is slowly
responding to the introduction of higher premiums, cost control and
improvements to portfolios.
Overall life profits were up 27% at #154m. The earnings of Commercial
Union's Dutch Delta Lloyd operation, which made the greatest individual
contribution, rose to #84m.
Life premium income in the UK fell from #596m to #585m, with difficult
market conditions reducing sales of new pensions products. UK life
profits were down #3m at #45m.
Overall, general insurance premium income rose 6% to #4316m, with life
premium income 29% higher at #2446m.

SHARES of hard-pressed construction group Costain tumbled 6p to stand
at a mere 12[1/2]p yesterday after the company said that it could not
get an acceptable offer for the sale of its remaining US coal mining
assets and that it was no longer expecting a bid for the group as a
whole.
Costain had announced a bid approach at the end of January. It is now
to retain and manage the US coal businesses and has written down their
book value by about #100m.
The market had been looking for a complete withdrawal by Costain from
coal in the US after the sale of Dolet Hills and some additional coal
assets for around $100m.
Costain shareholders have suffered badly in the last few years as the
value of the company has slumped from #1000m in 1990 to just #65m
currently and what prospect they had of retrieving something through a
bid -- though the terms were unlikely to have been generous -- looks to
have been dashed, at least for the time being.

A FAULT has been discovered in the safety catches fitted to some fire
escape windows of homes where two toddlers, one of whom died, have been
involved in falls in the past nine months.
Now East Lothian District Council has ordered modification of the
safety catches in 2000 houses.
The move follows a detailed investigation carried out by the authority
in the wake of an incident last month in which two-year-old Evan
Henderson was injured when he fell from a first-floor window at his
Wallyford home.
The council says that the cause of the accident has not yet been
established.
Last week, a fatal accident inquiry at Haddington Sheriff Court into
the death last summer of 21-month-old Ewan Smith, who plunged from the
window of a Musselburgh house, was adjourned after the sheriff ruled the
Wallyford child's fall should also be considered.
Lawyers for the local authority unsuccessfully opposed the move
arguing the windows involved were of a completely different design, and
had different catches. The FAI is due to resume later this month.
The investigation into the Wallyford accident found that, on some
windows, the small plastic peg used to release the window stay in an
emergency was not operating satisfactorily.
The council has now agreed all of them should be replaced by the
manufacturer. Replacement will begin shortly and is expected to take
around 10 days.
The homes involved are two-storey houses and flats across the
district, all of which have been fitted with double glazing within the
last few years. Not all emergency windows are affected.
Housing officers will make sure the catches are in full working order.
They will also ensure householders know how to operate the emergency
windows, and all windows will have special stickers warning they should
not be used for ventilation.
''Safety has to be our primary concern,'' council housing committee
chairman Councillor Pat Fawcett said.

AN Aberdeen hotelier is offering attractive bait for anglers on the
Dee to throw back the fish they catch to help increase stocks on the
royal river.
New voluntary restrictions are being implemented by beat owners to
maintain the fishing which generates more than #6m a year expenditure
along the river banks.
The fishermen, who pay handsomely for the privilege of casting on the
favourite river of the Queen Mother and the Prince of Wales, are allowed
to keep the first salmon they catch each week.
But Mr Stewart Spence, of The Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel, is giving
fishermen on his Commonty beat a farm-bred salmon as a replacement for
each subsequent fish they catch.
He is anxious to ensure that guests on the beat abide by the voluntary
code and it could prove a costly gesture. If, as expected, around 100
fish are caught during the season, it will cost him #2000 but he said
yesterday: "It will be money well spent. It is an investment in the
future. The more we have to give away the better, because it means the
fishing is good.
''The first week's fishing seems to have been very good, and everyone
appears to be taking the voluntary code on board. If the sport is good,
they are quite happy to throw the salmon back.
''Andrew Bradford on one of the other beats is offering smoked salmon
for the fish thrown back.''
The first three anglers to benefit from Mr Spence's generosity
yesterday received their farmed salmon.
Mr Alan Smith, a retired financier from Newcastle-under-Lyme, said the
catch-and-release scheme would be welcomed by all responsible anglers.
He said he had been coming to the Dee for 15 years and, although the
drop in numbers of fish would not have kept him away from the river, he
believed Mr Spence's gesture would encourage people to come and would
help the conservation cause.
The other recipients of the fish were Mr Ray Pickering and John Carr,
both from Stoke-on-Trent.

A GLASGOW office deal worth #2.8m demonstrates the underlying
investment demand for good-quality city-centre properties which are let
to prestigious clients, according to agents Lambert Smith Hampton. Gate
House, an office property at 201/203 West George Street, has just been
sold for the above sum by the agents on behalf of Albany Life Assurance
in an off-market deal.
Tenants in the multi-let property include: Allied Dunbar, Clerical
Medical &amp; General, and the Skipton Building Society. The investment was
bought by a discretionary fund client of Baring Houston &amp; Saunders,
introduced by Gee &amp; Co.
Stephen Inglis of Lambert Smith Hampton said: ''We have achieved a
good price for this property, illustrating further the strength of the
investment market for well let buildings in prime situations.
''This deal, together with the forward funding of office developments
at 183 St Vincent Street and 227 St West George Street on a speculative
basis, demonstrates the confidence that institutional investors now have
in the prime Glasgow office market.''

THE rate of capital growth in Scotland's property has slowed across
the board, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index (RESMI)
prepared exclusively for The Herald.
The retail sector's annual rate of capital growth slowed down from 11%
in January to 10% for the year to February. Office and industrial
capital growth slowed to 11.4% and 9.0% respectively leading to capital
growth for all property of 10.2% for the year to February.
All three sectors experienced zero month-on-month rental growth in
February, a slight improvement for the retail sector over the decline of
0.2% in January. There was no change in year-on-year rental growth in
any of the sectors. Offices continue to show negative rental growth at
-1.4%, all other sectors showing some annual growth.
Total returns continued to follow a downward trend. All property fell
from 19.7% last month to 18.3% for the year to February. The annual
rates for the office and retail sectors fell to 19.8% and 16.7%
respectively. Total return for industrial property held up well, falling
only slightly from 19.6% previously to 19.2% for the year to February.

THE path to quality accreditations BS5750 and ISO9002 is no easy
route, as Glasgow forklift truck hire specialists, Douglas Gillespie
Plant discovered. But now they are delighted to be celebrating their
success.
''I'm ready to admit that there were times when it meant a lot more
work than I had expected,'' said group chairman and managing director
Douglas Gillespie. ''But our staff were behind us from the start. We
know we are now a more efficient company, which benefits both ourselves
and our customers.''
This proudly independent family business includes many staff who have
more than 20 years' service behind them. That is important to Douglas
Gillespie, who firmly believes that a company is only as good as the
people who work for it.
''From the start, we had two reasons for going ahead. One was that we
knew it should tighten up our procedures in quality and service. The
other was that we were becoming aware that some of our customers were
very interested in quality accreditation.''
The first steps along the accreditation way began in 1992. Group
accountant Gordon Barclay who had been appointed quality manager, held a
series of meetings and training sessions which involved every single
member of staff.
''There were no exceptions,'' said Gordon Barclay. ''We set out to
explain to everyone that it was a priority matter for the firm's future
and not just a way of generating more paper work.''
Meetings and training sessions during working hours, backed up by
''quite a lot'' of management work after hours, included a complete
computer reprogramming as the required operating manual took shape. All
members of staff were invited to contribute suggestions towards the
shaping of the new procedures.
''Several of these suggestions were incorporated in the final
manual,'' said Gordon Barclay. They included a completely new approach
to customer inquiries and service requests, suggested by hire desk
staff. It began with a specially-created questionnaire for each customer
whether old or new.''
That suggestion was followed by others while sales and service
departments discovered they had acquired a new understanding of other
activities within the company.
''Everyone now knows much more about everyone else's job, with an
insight which covers all procedures. Now that these new procedures are
in place and now that we have acquired the quality accreditations,
working totally to these new exacting standards, we feel we have joined
a very exclusive club. Our staff are 100% proud of what we have achieved
-- particularly after the amount of work they all put in towards getting
there.''
Douglas Gillespie Plant point to benefits which include a new, speedy
and efficient way of tracing any fault that may occur. Their widespread
activities cover almost every part of Scotland, but a fault anywhere can
now be very quickly identified and eliminated, while steps are taken to
make sure it does not happen again.
''That is all down to our new manual of procedures 'bible','' said
Gordon Barclay. ''All the work that went into its preparation is paying
off in a major way.''
Congratulations from customers followed the awards. Another result has
been what Douglas Gillespie described as both opening existing business
doors wider and opening totally new business doors for the first time.
''We are being seen in a new light by people who have already achieved
BS5750 and ISO standards. We also find that we are becoming more aware
of other firms who we deal with or purchase from and who are similarly
qualified.''
Both awards are now part of the company logo on all Douglas Gillespie
vehicles and on the firm's letterheads.
The fork truck fleet serves many major commercial customers including
Allied Distillers, Scottish Brewers, ICI and Stoddard Carpets.
Typically, the rental company is particularly proud of the fact that the
Vesuvius Crucible Company, their first significant customer at their
beginning back in 1968, is among the many names which have continued to
do business with them ever since.
Uplifted by a steady growth
DOUGLAS Gillespie takes a considerable pride in the way the firm he
established has grown.
From small beginnings in 1968, it has grown into an organisation with
a #4.6m turnover forecast for 1995 and a predicted growth of more than
#5m for 1996.
''We have remained an independent family business throughout and along
the way we made it an aim never to lose a customer,'' he said at his
Darnley industrial estate headquarters. ''We know we are good at what we
do. Our forward mission is to continue to grow but to keep our feet on
the ground.''
A Glasgow man, Douglas Gillespie had been working in England for more
than 10 years before he returned to Scotland with a great desire to
start in business for himself. He spent some time in America researching
the fork lift rental business and then set up his own fork lift rental
business in East Kilbride. His wife Margaret, at that time a school
teacher, joined him to run the administrative and secretarial side. With
the appointment of two engineers, Douglas Gillespie Plant Hire, Fork
Lift specialists was underway.
Today Douglas Gillespie Plant Hire Fork Lift Company is the backbone
of the Douglas Gillespie group. It operates approximately 350 fork lift
vehicles -- the largest independent rental fleet in Scotland. The group
also operates one of the largest Calor Gas dealership in Scotland and
through its new division, Clarklift Scotland Limited, it is the
franchise holder for one of the world's leading fork lift truck
manufacturer.
From the inital 2000 sq ft start, growth came steadily. A move to
larger premises in East Kilbride was followed by the acquisition of a
12,000 sq ft base at Giffnock, then an additional depot and operating
base at Bellshill. By 1980 their turnover had passed the #1m figure. Ten
years later it had gone through the #2m mark.
The process of acquiring the group's present base at Darnley, a former
Calor Gas depot covering three and a half acres, also took place in 1990
and following an extensive refurbishment programme, Darnley was
established as the new headquarters.
''Two years ago we established Clarklift Scotland Limited as a new
division,'' said Douglas Gillespie. ''Clarklift are one of the world's
leading fork lift manufacturers and we sell throughout Scotland.''
To a wider world, the Douglas Gillespie plant hire name is also known
for another activity. Since the 1970s it has been prominent in its
support of competition golf. Douglas Gillespie at one time represented
Scotland in Youth International competitions.
As a sponsor he established the Douglas Gillespie Pro-Am competition
in the 1970s, bringing together top players, personalities and
customers. In the 1980s he launched a new tournament -- the Scottish
Under 25s professional championships. That was followed by the
sponsorship of the Glasgow Youth Amateur pro championship and the
Scottish Boys Under 16 national championship.
We have remained an independent family business and we make it an aim
never to lose a customer

AMERICAN lawyers are not going to give up easily on the tobacco
industry given the juicy rewards they would receive should they win
their case, the latest being based on a claim for compensation for
smokers allegedly addicted to the practice.
BAT Industries' chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy, ironically again on
annual No Smoking Day, shrugged off the latest action as he has done
others in the past, pointing out that the industry has never lost a case
yet.
He was confident the industry would win the current action, though it
is on a different scale to others, with 60 US law firms binding together
to make their case, which, they say, if successful, could result in
payouts of between $50bn and $100bn.
At least the political climate is more favourable with the Republicans
firmly installed in Congress, which rules out ideas like a hike in
excise duty to pay for healthcare reform.
Nearer to home, BAT's UK financial services companies, Allied Dunbar
and Eagle Star, have set aside #123m for correcting pensions
mis-selling, with most of the sum relating to Allied.
Sir Patrick's general confidence extends to this business also,
perhaps optimistically expecting the companies to increase their market
share when the sector returns to normal.
This hit is excluded from BAT's 1994 results as it is charged to
contingency reserve. This is just as well as profits would have been
down had it been taken from them. Reported profits were virtually
unchanged at #1802m, but if American Tobacco reorganisation charges are
excluded they were 10% up.
The $1000m purchase of American was only completed this year and gave
BAT full control of the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands. With the
American market looking better the acquisition will bring a good boost
to 1995 tobacco earnings.
BAT is maintaining its generous dividend policy with a 9% rise to
21.9p, after a final of 13.4p. In addition, shareholders will receive a
further 2.35p under the foreign income dividend scheme. Sir Patrick said
they remained confident of continuing to pay dividend increases ''well
ahead'' of inflation. Such is the power of the cash flow generated by
cigarettes.
The year was something of a mirror image of 1993, with financial
services relatively weak and tobacco firm. Eagle Star shared its
sector's improvement in underwriting performance, with the loss down
from #142m to #34m, helped by a halving in the mortgage indemnity
deficit.
But after allowing for a sharp fall in the investment total return,
reflecting weak bond and equity markets, its overall profits were
actually lower at #157m. Despite the traumas in its market, Allied
Dunbar's contribution was a little higher, increasing overall life
profits by #10m to #379m, on the back of modest premium growth and tight
control of costs.
Farmers, the US insurance activity, was affected by the Los Angeles
earthquake but good business elsewhere brought a small increase in
profits, though the life side was a little lower.
Back to cigarettes, to the chagrin of the antis, volume rose 4%,
spurred by a 13% jump in exports from the US, UK and Germany,
particularly to the Far East, Middle East and central and eastern
Europe. Brown &amp; Williamson in the US excelled, doubling profits to #395m
on volume gains and better sales mix. The market stabilised and market
share gains were made by brands like Kool.
BAT's ultra-modern factory in Southampton continued to improve
productivity and its exports were well up, with up-market brands like
State Express 555, Benson &amp; Hedges and John Player Gold Leaf to the
fore.
BAT continues to make significant headway into new markets,
particularly in the old Soviet bloc. Once the investment programme is
complete it will have the capacity to make 100 billion cigarettes a
year. China is the ultimate treasure trove as its citizens puff their
way through a third of global consumption but so far BAT serves the
market through exports. Meanwhile, ever active, the group is setting
itself up in Vietnam.
BAT rolls on like a juggernaut and an increase in profits is
inevitable this year. The shares, up 11p at 422p, probably sell at under
10 times prospective earnings and yield 7.2% which looks like value,
until you remember the group's main product. One day some lawsuit is
going to stick and the rating has to bear this in mind.

IT hasn't escaped the notice of one Birchwood Courtyards company that
this is the Chinese Year of the Pig. Nothing connected with pigs,
however, can be expected to escape the notice of a firm with the title
New Pig Ltd.
This youthful but growing company has nothing to do with pigs -- it is
rather more interested in the manufacture and distribution of industrial
absorbents.
It was the excellent transport links offered by Motherwell District
which influenced the company's decision to locate at the Birchwood
Courtyards.
The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New Pig Corporation of
Pennsylvania, and its establishment in 1993 represented that
corporation's first step into Europe. The subsidiary is now distributing
its products to different parts of the Continent and Scandinavia -- and
the proximity of the M74, M8 and M73 means, that goods can be well on
their way within minutes, says managing director Alastair McSkimming.
The fast access to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports also means European
and Scandinavian markets are within a few hours' reach -- another
facility appreciated by Mr McSkimming.
Deliveries, too, can be made at any time to New Pig's three units at
Birchwood -- there are no parking or offloading restrictions. ''We can
get our orders out on the same day,'' says Mr McSkimming.
'Pig' incidentally, stands for Partners in Grime. The parent firm was
established in 1985, so the Year of the Pig coincides with its tenth
anniversary. An innovator in providing solutions to industrial and
hazardous leakage problems, it now counts more than 94% of the Fortune
500 among its 100,000 US customers, and has a $55m turnover.
Its first product was an absorbent sock, and it now offers no fewer
than 1200 products.
The Scottish subsidiary was already enjoying the fruits of
Motherwell's prime location, based at the district council's industrial
estate at Righead, when the opportunity came to move to Birchwood. ''As
a distribution centre, the location is excellent,'' says Alastair
McSkimming.
His company occupies about 12,000 sq ft in its three units, but is now
looking to double its space to cater for expansion.
Elsewhere at the Birchwood Courtyards, there is similar high praise
for the development's transport links from a company which is eyeing up
world markets for an innovative new product which could make tyre
punctures virtually a thing of the past.
Tyresafe (International) Ltd anticipates a worldwide response to an
invention which seems destined to make a major contribution to road
safety. Its tyre sealant, developed over a five-year period by Donald
Daisley with the help of several Scottish universities, is water-based
and injected through the tyre valve.
It coats the inside of the tyre and prevents air loss in the case of a
puncture of up to 15mm in diameter. ''You could be driving along a
motorway, have a puncture, and not even know about it,'' says Daisley.
''That's a lot better than struggling with the wheel for control of your
vehicle.''
He claims that other sealants deal only with much smaller holes and
that they are unsuitable for heavy or fast vehicles. One road-rally team
at a recent Inverness event unexpectedly took second place after not one
of its five cars developed a puncture. This, after careering at up to
130mph over forest roads.
It was the only team in the event which did not have to stop and
change wheels due to such tyre damage and the performance of the
Tyresafe sealant has caused a stir in the rallying world.
Daisley, who is the firm's technical director, and Ed Craik, its
managing director, pay tribute to the speed with which Motherwell
District Council found them a suitable factory. ''We approached them on
August 18, 1994,'' says Craik, ''and got the keys to our new
headquarters on September 6.''
The council also helped with a low-cost loan, which was welcome at a
time when the company was constructing its own customised manufacturing
facility. From a cold start, Tyresafe now employs nine people and has
just clinched its first export order, to Malaysia.
Negotiations are under way with companies in France, Australia, Kenya,
Zimbabwe, and Russia and the product has attracted keen attention from
various police forces, including Strathclyde, and other multi-users such
as fleet operators.
Already the fast access to the national motorway network has proved a
boon. Says Ed Craik, ''The location could not be better. We are now
taking our product to the world marketplace, and are doing so from the
perfect base.''

WITH its recent purchase for #1076m of the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up
companies in the US, confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury
Schweppes has really launched itself into the big league world market
for soft drinks and the prime focus for the company this year will be
absorbing and managing Dr Pepper.
But meantime, it continued to make progress in most areas in 1994, not
badly hurt so far by the cola wars in the UK. And acquisitions have
helped boost overseas market penetration in both its confectionery
business and in soft drinks.
A full contribution from A&amp;W Brands lifted volume growth US carbonated
soft drinks by 51%, while European confectionary saw exports to Russia
almost treble -- Russians, it seems, now consume one million bars of
Cadbury's chocolate per day.
Pre-tax profits last year increased by almost 15% from #416.3m to
#478.5m after a provision of #23m to complete the programme of
re-shaping the Spanish beverages business, much in line with projections
made at the time of the Pepper deal.
Shareholders are to receive a second interim dividend of 11p taking
the total to 15.60p, a rise of 8.3%.
Group sales advanced 8.2% from #3725m to #4030m of which 4.7% was from
acquisitions and disposals and 4.5% from increased activity. There was a
1% drop on exchange rates.
Cadbury Schweppes is also able to report that trading margins
strengthened from 11.7% to 12.5% over the year. A particularly
interesting aspect of the results is the progress of Coca-Cola Schweppes
Beverages (CCSB), the UK bottling operation with Coca-Cola. Progess here
was, and is, under threat from the outbreak of cola wars whereby the
supermarkets bring out their own products in an attempt to undercut the
premium prices enjoyed by Coke.
In fact, despite the flood of own-label colas, total volumes grew by
10% last year with cola brands up 9%. The cola share held overall with
volume at a record. The exceptionally good weather helped but an
improvement in margins and market share in the middle of the wars was
still not bad going.
As Cadbury group chief executive David Wellings pointed, it shows that
soft drinks are not confined to supermarkets although prices fell as
Coke was forced to offer discounts and incentives to head of the
competition.
The current year could prove tougher, though, and it cannot be assumed
that there will be another warm summer to help mitigate the impact.
Chairman Dominic Cadbury, commenting on the group's progress, said:
''The 1994 results continue our momentum and confidence that we will
make further progress in 1995. The acquisition of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up
gives us the opportunity to compete in the mainstream of the beverage
market from a position of growing strength. We do not underestimate the
challenge but believe we have the experience and tools for the task.''
Cadbury Schweppes is also part of the Camelot National Lottery
Consortium and while it is still early days, the company said the
lottery has come up to expectations in financial terms.
Cadbury Schweppes shares slipped 3p to 423p.

STANDARD Chartered, the London-based bank which does most of its
business in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, yesterday revealed a 27%
rise in 1994 profits, helped largely by cost-cutting and lower bad
debts.
Pre-tax profit rose to #401m from #510m in 1993, and was up by 36%
before exceptional items.
''These are record results. We have grown our operating profits and
reduced our costs,'' chairman Patrick Gillam said.
The bank said it had not been affected by the Barings debacle. It had
reviewed to its satisfaction management controls and audit procedures
after the collapse of Barings from massive trading losses at the British
merchant bank's Singapore financial futures and options trading unit.
''It would be a very strange business indeed that didn't pause and
check again as a result,'' finance director Peter Wood said.
He said that although Standard has a futures brokerage in Singapore
and trades financial derivative instruments for currency hedging and
interest rate swaps it is not a speculative trader.
''We are not a major derivatives participant -- even in interest rate
derivatives,'' he added.
Bad and doubtful debts fell to #122m from #233m, making profit before
charges of #627m against #613m in 1993, the bank held costs at just
below 1993 levels and reduced its headcount in the year to 28,200 from
30,500.
The dividend total is increased 33% to 8p and earnings per share rose
to 32.7p from 24.1p. -- Reuter.

SUCCESS, it seems, does breed success after all. And taking a chance,
as in the case of 26 high-class industrial units owned by Motherwell
District Council at Strathclyde Business Park, can pay off.
Not that there was any real risk of not attracting businesses to The
Birchwood Courtyards. The situation could not be bettered, the
environment was right, and the district council, having invested no less
than #4.4m, was proving flexible in its leasing agreements.
Today the council is celebrating the fact that all 26 units are let,
that 136 jobs have been created, and that work is about to start on a
third phase of this project.
As for breeding success, some of the companies which have moved in are
already seeking extra space.
The proximity of the development to Scotland's motorway network, its
easy access to Scotland's two major cities and their airports, and the
fact that this is a greenfield site with no parking problems have
combined to create an environment which is geared to expansion,
optimism, and the generation of employment.
That is what the whole project is about, so the council and its
Industrial Development and Estates unit must feel its investment is
paying off. It is hard to believe that this beautifully landscaped
industrial facility was disused farmland only four years ago.
''Buying the land and having these units built on a speculative basis
was a departure for us,'' says Gordon Smith, Head of Industrial
Development and Estates. ''It was our first new site for 20 years, the
others owned by us were inherited when the council was established in
1975.
''We were also aiming for a different market. Rental levels have
exceeded #4 per sq ft and it has become clear that companies are
prepared to pay for the opportunity to operate in such a quality
environment. The high specification of the units has also been a
factor.''
The units in the first two phases are between 2000 and 5000 sq ft but
Phase Three is going to consist of four at between 4850 and 6900 sq ft.
They should be ready by spring of next year and, says Gordon Smith, ''we
would be disappointed if they didn't generate a further 150 jobs.''
Companies moving into the first two phases have had every help from
the district council in the provision of rent-free periods, flexible
leases, and business assistance services.
The council will be equally responsive to the needs of those
interested in phase three which, as Smith points out, will probably be
the last major industrial development carried out by Motherwell District
Council before the new North Lanarkshire Council takes over in April,
1996.
''It will be a birthday present to the new council,'' he says. ''With
any luck, it will have some tenants as well.''
There is no doubt about the main reason for The Birchwood Courtyards'
success.
Companies based there are at the heart of Scotland's motorway system
with the M8, M74 and M73 only minutes away. It is a dream location for
companies seeking a manufacturing or distribution base with fast access
to north, south, east or west.
Glasgow and Edinburgh, along with their international airports, are
easily accessible and the main electrified Glasgow-London rail route
places Motherwell District about four-and-a-half hours from London.
Also, the Eurocentral Scotland Freight Terminal at nearby Mossend is
soon to provide direct freight access to Europe's 320 million consumers.
Some of the companies now based at The Birchwood Courtyards have their
sights set on Europe and beyond, with Scandinavia, all points of Europe,
North America, and Malaysia already in mind. They are at the heart of
things at the Business Park, and the units they occupy are designed for
twenty-first century success.

<HEADLINE>RTZ pulls off major mining coup and pushes earnings up by 60%</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

RTZ appears to have
pulled off a major coup -- it has an agreement to buy its way into
Freeport-McMoRan Copper which will give it immediately about 10% of the
world's fourth-largest copper mine.
The pit contains 40 million ounces of gold -- the largest known
deposit.
Chief executive Robert Wilson could scarcely conceal his excitement
yesterday that the Grasberg mine in Irian Jaya in Indonesia could, in
due course, come under RTZ control.
As with all major mining decisions, the rewards will take time to
arrive. There will be little impact on earnings until 1998.
The City liked the deal and the better than expected results for 1994.
They included a much higher than expected dividend and a statement
about metal prices and demand which was the most optimistic anyone can
remember the world's largest mining group ever having made in the past.
Investors liked what they saw and pushed the shares ahead 26p to 755p.
Attributable profits after tax jumped by 60% to #595m with #173m
coming from higher prices while volume accounted for another #35m.
Copper prices averaged 105 cents per pound during the year compared with
1993's 87 cents and the current 133 cents.
RTZ expects that after an overall 7% improvement in 1994 metal prices
there should be increases of about 3% to 4% both for 1995 and 1996.
Current prices are still 32% below their 1988 peak.
Thanks to the group's long-range planning, even if there is any future
softening of prices, they will be countered by additional group capacity
coming on stream. RTZ is in the fortunate position of having the bulk of
the world's low-cost mines in its portfolio.
Grasberg will have a copper production price of 23 cents a pound which
compares with the 40 cents of RTZ's other operations such as Bingham
Canyon in the US and Escondida in Chile.
There are another eight major projects at various stages of
development including exploration for diamonds in Canada and expansion
of aluminium capacity in the Australian state of Queensland.
So if there is any global over-capacity it will be other producers who
will bear the pain. Cost efficiency is such that RTZ was able to take
#32m of costs out of the business last year.
The US coal operations, which produce about 50 million tons annually,
are worth considerably more than their acquisition costs as a result of
the the recovery in the American economy and demand for low sulphur
coal.
The capital expenditure programme has peaked at #534m (#276m). Work on
the Bingham Canyon smelter is almost complete and it will become
operational soon to reduce copper costs by 14 cents a pound.
After the Grasberg deal, gearing could increase from 7% to about 25%
including the #300m or so acquisition costs and #500m of exploration and
development expenses for the mine.
Production for next year is planned at 500,000 tonnes of copper and
1.5 million ounces of gold.
RTZ is boosting its dividend total by 34% to UK taxpayers through the
use of Foreign Income Dividends.
There is a final Foreign Income Dividend of 11.5p and a conventional
payment of 7p which together raise the total to 27.5p to put the shares
on a 4.5% yield.
Pencilling in attributable profits of #800m for the current year seems
a bankable proposition which would leave the shares trading at 10 times
likely earnings.

SHARES in Lloyds Chemists were decimated when the company disclosed
that it is having to shut down its drugstore division of 308 outlets
because it can no longer compete against the plethora of retailers
selling cut-price toiletries. The shares slumped 48p to 237p.
A review of the division has yet to be finalised but it is expected to
lead to the closure of 100 shops. Around 180 of the rest will be
converted to a new health and beauty format within the chemists
division, and a further 30 will become Holland &amp; Barrett stores.
Finance director Michael Ward said that both the drugstore market and
consumers had changed since the industry's heyday in the seventies and
eighties. Lloyds has decided to invest its money in its other businesses
where it can make good margins.
These continue to prosper and enabled it to offset the loss produced
by the shops on overall group profits. In the six months to end-December
taxable profits moved up just 1.4% to #26.6m despite a near-20% increase
in turnover to #550.3m.
There was a marginal increase in fully-diluted earnings per share to
14.04p, but the company's confidence in its future prospects was
demonstrated by the decision to raise the interim dividend by 7.4% to
2.9p per share. There is a scrip dividend alternative.
On a divisional basis, the chemists business performed well despite
the timing of the flu epidemic. Its sales rose by 4% on an underlying
basis.
The company remains on the lookout for further chemists chains to
acquire. It made several purchases in the first half including a number
of independent chains in Scotland such as the five Millers stores in
Edinburgh.
Holland &amp; Barrett, the healthfood retailer, reported 6% growth in
underlying sales. Twenty-one new stores were opened in the period,
bringing the total to 324.
The pharmaceutical division showed strong growth in sales and profits.
It is the largest wholesaler in Scotland. The integration of the
wholesale pharmaceutical depots continues and is on track to be
completed by the end of 1995. The veterinary division reported a 60%
increase in its profits in what remains a buoyant market.
Trading in the first nine weeks of the second half is said to have
been positive with overall group sales 19.3% ahead of the comparable
period last year. However, that masks a 4% decline in drugstore sales
underlining the problems the business faces.

THE timing of The Scottish Asian Investment Company's planned doubling
of its holdings in the trouble-torn Hong Kong market will be crucial to
full-year performance.
Reporting a 16.2% decline in net asset value to 248p in the six months
to January 31, the Glasgow-based investment trust revealed plans to
target the colony in a big way on any market weakness. It had previously
cut back substantially in Hong Kong.
The fall in the Murray Johnstone-run trust's net asset value came
against the backdrop of respective 15.6%, 5% and 25.2% declines in stock
markets in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Malaysian equities accounted for 24.7% of the #51m fund at the halfway
stage, with shares in Singapore making up 20.1%, and Hong Kong equities
accounting for 14.4%.
Since the year end, the trust's net asset value has recovered to 264p.
Scottish Asian will also be looking to reduce its holdings in Malaysia
by more than one-third on anticipated market strength in the run-up to
the country's general election.
Rising US interest rates, fall-out from the Mexican financial crisis
and the Chinese succession issue all hit sentiment in the six months to
January.
A major sell-off by US investors during January hit Scottish Asian's
holdings, which are primarily blue chips, particularly hard.
The trust, which aims for capital growth through investment in Asia
except Japan, managed a 39% rise in net asset value to 296p in the year
to last July in spite of a poor second half.
In line with policy, no interim dividend will be paid.

FOUR years ago Richard Emanuel borrowed #3000 from his bank and
launched DX Mobile Phones.
The gamble paid off and the Bank of Scotland manager who agreed to
back the young 22-year-old must be rubbing his hands with glee.
''I was the sales manager with a small mobile phone company,''
explained Richard, ''and I thought I could do better''.
He was joined on his new venture by Rae McDonald, who worked beside
him in his old job. ''It was a brave thing for Rae to do at the time as
she gave up a pretty secure job,'' said Richard.
The gamble certainly paid off for everyone involved. DX expects to
have a #12 million plus turnover this year, a massive leap from last
year's #4 million, and Rae is now office manager with a staff of 85 to
look after.
Despite the rapid growth which saw DX sell around 120 phones in the
first year of business to sales in the region of 30,000 this year,
Richard Emanuel expects more growth.
''This year we will open up in another eight locations to strengthen
our position in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. This will give us a
presence in areas that we are not in yet,'' he said.
He points to the fact that the number of mobile phones in the UK is
expected to grow from the existing 3.5 million to 11 million in five
years time.
''There is only a three to four per cent market penetration in
Scotland,'' Richard said, ''which is less than half the penetration in
England. There is plenty of room for growth.''
To keep pace with the rate of expansion DX may go down the franchise
route. ''One of the problems of becoming larger is that it is more
difficult to maintain management control to ensure our quality of
service,'' explained the youthful managing director, ''but if people
have a stake in their own business it is easier''.
Why the DX title? Richard was reading a book by a Canadian business
guru who wrote that to succeed in business a person requires Desire and
Expectation which prompted Richard to name his company DX.

WHO wants to be a housebuilder these days? The market is tailing off
and bad weather is currently adding to the uncertainties caused by the
economic climate, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Even what is usually regarded as the best in the industry is being hit
with Beazer Homes chief executive Dennis Webb saying yesterday that
reservations in the first couple of months in 1995 are 9% below those of
a year earlier in what is usually the beginning of the best selling
season of the year.
The company, which was spun off from Hanson last year at 165p (now
126p), saw half-time pre-tax profits leap 57% to #24.5m on a 53% rise in
turnover to #205m.
Margins improved slightly to 12.3% but were held back by the sharp
increase in the number of social housing units sold from 276 to 719.
These include those brought in with the Mowlem Homes' acquisition for
#31m and where selling prices average #38,100, a fall from the preceding
year's #41,000, which has resulted in dragging down the Beazer overall
average by #500 to #61,500.
The Walker Homes subsidiary built 128 units at an average price of
#80,000 and seems set to effectively double last year's total.
Altogether Beazer sold 503 units in Scotland with a 7.5% market share.
Social housing margins should improve as the Mowlem units are brought
up to Beazer levels of profitability of around 10%. However, that will
coincide with a likely drop in national sales on social units as
Government grants are cut further -- by about #600m.
Beazer is well heeled with net cash of #54m which is being used to
expand the land bank with requirements for the next three years now
covered at 17,961 plots.Full-year profits seem likely to emerge at
around #52m compared with #33.9m for the preceding nine months. The
interim dividend is 1.95p with a 5.75p total possible for a 5.7% yield.
* CUSSINS Property increased full-year pre-tax profits 57% to #2.22m on
sales 19% greater at #23.9m. Private house sales rose 14% to 323 units.
The dividend total has been increased 25% to 3.75p with a 2.35p final.

From its distinguished history in banking, Scotland has now become a
major financial centre. Harry Conroy reports on our fastest-growing
indigenous industry
SCOTLAND may not be in the Top 10 of footballing nations in the world
but when it comes to hard cash we are up there with the best of them.
As a nation we recently nudged into the Premier League of the world's
centres for handling equities under management.
In Europe we are the third financial centre, behind London and Paris,
but ahead of Frankfurt.
It is facts like these which allows Professor Grant Baird, chief
executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, to feel no sense of
inferiority when mingling with European or global business bosses.
After all, among the SFE's 200-odd membership are some world leaders
such as Standard Life, the largest mutual assurance company in Europe
and General Accident, the third largest general insurer in the UK and
the 26th largest in the United States.
The financial sector in Scotland has deep roots going back hundreds of
years with the Bank of Scotland this year celebrating it's 300th
anniversary.
It is this long history which allows Scotland to claim the oldest
professional bodies of their kind in the world in the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland founded in 1854 and the Chartered
Institute of Bankers in Scotland founded in 1875.
''There is no doubt that our financial services sector is seen as
independent from London,'' said Professor Baird, ''and we are
expanding''.
This expansion can be seen on the jobs front where, in 1993, the
estimated number of people employed in banking, insurance and business
services was estimated to be 209,000. This figure had risen to 218,000
in 1994.
Among the new companies to arrive is the Abbey National's personal
finance direct phone service which, within the next three years, will
employ 250 in their Glasgow headquarters, while General Accident Direct
are also increasing their their workforce at Bishopbriggs.
Financial and business services is Scotland's fastest growing sector
in terms of employment with 70,000 jobs created since 1985.
The success story includes the arrival of Barclays Stockbrokers in
Glasgow in 1989. In their first year Barclays Stockbrokers employed 97
staff. Today it is breaking through the 400 figure.
Allied Provincial Securities, created in 1986 by the merger of eight
regional stockbroking firms, has its head office in Glasgow and all the
firm's settlements are done in the city.
The presence of such firms has meant that the Scottish Stock Exchange,
a unit of the London Stock Echange, has grown in importance and is now
the largest regional stock exchange in the UK.
Glasgow handles one third of the transactions completed by the London
Stock Exchange.
Tony Vine-Lott of Barclays Stockbrokers illustrated the importance of
Glasgow as a Stock Exchange centre when he said: ''We have more than
90,000 customers with total assets in the region of #1,100m which we
invest on their behalf through Glasgow.''
Scotland's financial heritage dates back to the seventeenth century
when the Bank of Scotland was founded in 1695 but Edinburgh blossomed as
an international investment centre when the legal companies began to
invest money on behalf of their rich merchant clients.
Their activities gave rise to the growth of investment trusts and
Scottish money helped build the Canadian Pacific Railroad, while Scots
investors owned ranches such as the ''Matador'' in Texas.
Scottish based fund managers now control more than #40 billion of
funds with over one third of UK investment trusts managed in Scotland,
including two of the largest independant trusts, the Alliance Trust and
the Scottish Investment Trust.
Grant Baird pointed out: ''In the past eight years there has been
almost a four-fold increase in the value of funds managed in Scotland.
Our strength in this area continues to grow.''
More than 20,000 are currently employed in the Scottish life sector
and the eight Scottish life companies have funds of #92.5 billion under
their control.
The Scottish life sector is reckoned to have 18.6% of all the UK
long-term life assurance and pension business, and 21% of UK personal
pension business.
''The number of people employed by our life companies has more than
doubled since 1986'', said Professor Baird.
Despite the size of the Scottish financial sector, and the importance
to our economy it was a disparate force until Scottish Financial
Enterprise was formed in 1986.
''Our aim,'' said Professor Baird, ''is to enhance Scotland's position
as a financial sector of world standing.''
The SFE has acted as a catalyst and was heavily involved along with
Scottish Enterprise in ensuring that AIM (Alternative Investment Market)
was successfully launched last month.
It was expected that AIM could have a major spin-off effect on
Scottish brokers, solicitors and accountants who could grab a major
slice of the work involved in floating smaller companies.
''Our membership ranges from the main banks and merchant banks, to
brokers, lawyers, and accountants who provide the support services in
Scotland.
''It is the presence of such an infrastructure which can attract more
business to Scotland through AIM,'' said Grant Baird.
Scottish banks have also in recent years begun to flex their financial
muscle.
Since 1986 their total assets have grown by 180% to #74.2 billion and
they continue to lead the way in may areas of banking.
It was Scots who invented watermarks on banks, and would you believe
it, introduced cash credits, the forerunner of overdrafts.
The financial sector now accounts for almost 20% of Scotland's GDP,
and one in nine Scot's are employed in it.
The introduction of information technology means that geographical
location is no longer important. Expertise and reputation is what is
required, and the Scottish financial community has plenty of both.

SCOTLAND faces a stark challenge as it approaches the millennium. It
must accede to the need for nothing less than a cultural revolution if
it is to survive as an economic force and we are to maintain and improve
our standard of living against competitor nations.
The seat of that challenge lies in education, attainment of
qualifications and their relevancy to our industrial and commercial
infrastructure. Patently, in any rapidly moving economic environment,
the quality of the output from our educational and training
establishments needs continuous development -- to at least the level of
our industrial and commercial rivals. By implication, that must be the
responsibility not only of the educationalists, but also of employers,
in equal measure.
For a text book lesson in the way forward, witness many of our highly
successful inward investing companies. A major component in that success
is their own commitment, and that of the workforces, to continuous
skills development -- a corollary of the need to remain competitive in
the international marketplace.
ASCETT, an industry-led body chaired by John Ward (Director of IBM's
operations in Scotland and Northern England, and Chairman of CBI
Scotland) was established in 1993 by the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Its key purpose is to oversee and report annually to the
Scottish Office on progress towards a set of quite specific education
and skills targets for the year 2000, as well as to advise the
Government on the performance and policies required to achieve them.
Launched in April of last year, the Education and Training Targets for
a Competitive Scotland -- the first of their kind in Scotland -- demand
that four key targets be met:
1. Eightyfive per cent of young people attain SVQ Level II -- five
standard grades, or equivalent.
2. Seventy per cent attain SVQ Level III -- three highers, or
equivalent.
3. Sixty per cent of the workforce to be qualified to at least SVQ
Level III.
4. Fifty per cent of organisations recognised as, or committed to,
Investors in People.
These are targets designed to significantly lift Scotland's levels of
attainment in education and skills training to increase the power of our
economic engine. To be fully achievable, they require not only the
committed input of Government and educationalists, but that of the wider
business community. In short, they are about making Scotland
world-class.
To put the size of the challenge into focus -- 69% of young people
managed the first target in 1992, the benchmark year. Fifty per cent
succeeded in attaining the second target and 42% the third. Just 21
companies had completed assessment for, or committed themselves to, the
Investors in People goal. By comparison, France has already achieved
goal three, a target we're not scheduled to hit until the turn of the
century.
The targets are set against a need to keep pace, or close gaps, with
competitors in North America, other parts of Western Europe, Japan and
emergent economic forces in the Far East and Eastern Europe.
To achieve target one, Scotland must maintain its average annual
increase of 2.7%. Measured from 1990, we are currently on schedule, but
many things could upset the rate of progress. It is necessary, for
example, to encourage all young men and women, not in full-time
education, to aim for an SVQ at Level II or above. This means we need
high-quality careers education and advice provision.
The second target, I admit, is demanding. To succeed here, we need to
accomplish the projected advances in meeting target one and use this as
a foundation for higher level qualifications. Since 1990, the average
annual increase has been 2.9%. In order to reach the target, we need an
annual increase of 3.48%.
Acceptance of the need to undergo continuous learning, or Life Long
Learning, as it's been dubbed, is crucial among both employers and
individuals. It is central to our long-term industrial and economic
health and is already the focus of human resource development in several
large manufacturing concerns.
Success depends upon a variety of factors, but chiefly upon
implementing and achieving the SVQ framework across all sectors.
There is a link to the fourth target concerning the Investors In
People programme. This award is intended to provide a framework for
improving business performance by demonstrating the association between
people development and practical business performance. The programme is
undergoing a review in Scotland with the objective of making it more
beneficial to all sectors and companies, including the small business
community. By the end of 1994, 650 companies had committed to it.
A consultation document, World Class Scotland, is available from
ASCETT , 120 Bothwell Street, Glasgow G2 7JP. It is free of charge and
we welcome responses to it.
The challenges facing us are broad, but they also carry depth in
relation to all our futures. We all have a responsibility to our
economy. Put very crudely, if we don't apply ourselves as a nation to
the tasks ahead, perhaps the phrase that starts off with ''Wha's like
us, damn few . . .'' will come to represent something dangerously at
odds with the original sentinment.
The jury is out until January 1, 2000.
* Stephanie Young, Director of the Advisory Scottish Council for
Education and Training Targets (ASCETT), was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

There has been no shortage of irony in Alan Jefferson's life since he
arrived in Scotland seven years ago.
He came north to take over the position of sales director of the
Clydesdale chain, then seen as a successful expanding company. But Alan
did not stay long in the position as he ''did not see eye to eye on
policy'' with those above him.
Shortly after his departure from Clydesdale he joined ScottishPower to
set up a seperate retail division in readiness for privatisation.
The task facing the newcomer in his job was daunting. In 1990 the new
division made a loss of #5.3m but by 1993/94 he had turned this round to
a #7.4m profit.
The turnaround is partly due to ScottishPower's purchase last year of
39 superstores -- formerly trading as Clydesdale!
Alan's memory of ScottishPower's showrooms on arrival is of clocks!
''There were 20 suppliers to our 73 shops. Each manager could order
directly. We had every kind of clock you could think of but it was not
the way to run a business. There was no way you could control it.''
Nowadays the clocks are gone and ScottishPower are now more focused on
what they sell.
In 1992 Alan moved ScottishPower Retail into TV and audio equipment.
The Retail Divisions turnover is approaching #200m this year making it
the UK's third largest electrical retailer.
This growth has meant that ScottishPowers share of the white goods
market has gone from 16% to 35% and in the audio field they have gone
from zero to 20%.
Although he had not lived in Scotland until his work brought him here
Alan was no stranger to the country.
He spent most of his holiday's around the Ullapool area of the West
Highlands enjoying his favourite pastime of birdwatching.
But it is not just our feathered friends that Alan is keeping an eye
open for it is also any possible sites for expansion.

THIS week's TrailBlazer focuses on the evolution of one of the most
successful young companies in the north Glasgow area. In 1987, David
Baird, a former electronics engineer with the Anderson Strathclyde
mining group, established Kelvinside Electronics Ltd (KEL) in
Kirkintilloch, from what originally formed the group's electronics
division.
''Anderson Strathclyde was going through a lot of restructuring at the
time and had no further use for the electronic division,'' Baird
explains, ''I could have stayed with the group but my future role was
unclear and it would probably have meant relocating. I realised that the
electronics division still had potential on its own merit and Anderson
would still have a need for the product.''
A feasibility study confirmed this potential, which was sufficient
motivation to set up the company and provide a fully comprehensive range
of services to clients requiring the input of specialist knowledge and
expertise in the field of electronic design and manufacture. It was
originally utilised in the production of control panels and air flow
detection instruments with Anderson as the main client.
Though business flourished in the first year the company has had its
hurdles to overcome. During its second year of operation the mining
industry entered its downward spiral and it became clear to Baird that
the company had to diversify into other more promising areas of
production if it was to continue.
''The prosperity enjoyed during our first year allowed us to spend the
second year bringing in new personnel and developing the business
towards a new client base,'' said Baird.
The company expanded its services to include electronic design,
prototyping, CAD -- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design, full component
procurement, PCB assembly, final system assembly, inspection, testing
and packaging. The client base expanded to include companies in fields
such as aerospace, the automotive and marine industries, computer
manufacture, offshore petrochemical and the entertainment sector.
''For the luxury jet market we have taken a basic concept and produced
a range of galley and entertainment control panels'', added Baird, ''All
of the panels were designed by KEL and are fully supported and
maintained by the company.''
The firm have also completed a high-volume automotive project
involving PCB design, manufacture and test of a panel which illuminates
dashboard instrumentation.
Manufacturing services offered by KEL range from ''free issue'' PCB
assembly through to complete procurement of all materials required
within a system build including enclosures, power supplies, wiring and
so on.
When the company was approached by Dunbartonshire Local Enterprise
Company (LEC) and invited to become a growth partner, Baird agreed that
the time for expansion had arrived. With some assistance from the LEC,
new custom-built premises are currently being built in Kilsyth to where
KEL hopes to move in September. This represents an investment of around
#1.5m over the next two years by KEL. Sales and marketing manager, Paul
Brooks, joined the firm 10 months ago as part of its expansion
programme. ''Our five-year plan which started six months ago, is to
increase the size of the company by further developing our customer base
and bringing more employment to the area,'' he said.
The company currently employs a staff of 16 and, mainly through word
of mouth and personal referrals, has established an enviable customer
base with many blue-chip companies including IBM (UK) Ltd, British
Aerospace and Scottish Power.

INTERNATIONAL Women's Day, National No Smoking Day . . . yesterday
seemed a little crowded. We considered all the psychological pressures
during our coffee break in the Nerd House commissariat.
''I'm glad these 'Days' are getting bunched together like that,''
offered The Braces. ''It leaves more of the year free for normal life.
If you behave normally on one of these 'Days', people look at you as if
you're some kind of rat. Lend us a fag, Angelica.
Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, tossed her
packet across with a frown. ''You are a rat,'' she said, ''on this of
all days''.
The Braces was flummoxed. ''Angelica,'' he said, ''you're smoking too.
You know what we decided. One for all, all for one, and all that. We
would not bow to psychological coercion.''
Angelica said that wasn't what she meant. This was also International
Women's Day, and The Braces should be lending her a cigarette. ''See
what you mean,'' said The Braces, taking one of Angelica's super-low tar
tipped, incinerating the far end, and coughing slightly. ''Gad,'' he
said, ''these are horrible''.
We came to the conclusion, though, that The Braces had stumbled upon
an interesting if somewhat radical concept. If all the ''Days'' which
were designed to inflict feelings of anxiety and remorse upon us were
amalgamated, then the contrition industry would be severely castrated,
which seemed an appropriate term for Women's Day.
For example, we could continue to combine International Women's Day
with National No Smoking Day, bring in Mother's Day, Father's Day and St
Valentine's Day, and invent some new ones like Vegetarian Day, Jogging
Day, No Soap Opera Day, No Jokes Day and International Celibacy Day. The
pressure groups would have their moment, and the whole thing could be
disposed of in 24 hours. It could be called ''International Guilt Day''.
We liked the idea. But what would be the best date?
''How about February 29?'' asked Angelica, reaching for her packet of
fags. As a special gesture to mark yesterday's celebration, The Braces
clunked open his Zippo and gave her flame.
* The awful plight of Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas --
called back before the Commons select committee to discuss a bonus
scheme which could increase his modest basic salary of #450,000 by 125%
-- has been haunting me. I have been having dreams about it.
People, who have salaries, do not like to discuss them. This is an
ancient code. Some prefer not to debate them with their spouses, let
alone Commons select committees. For the same reason, people do not like
to discuss their winnings at the dog track with their spouses, or with
Commons select committees, although you don't tend to get bonus schemes
at the dog track.
As a minor player in the affairs of Nerd House, a mere functionary in
our gloom-laden financial services sector, I imagined myself summoned to
a committee room in Westminster and asked to explain my earnings.
Chairman: ''It says here that your earnings fluctuate between #20,000
and #30,000 a year. Do you expect us to believe that?''
Me: No. ''I can hardly believe it myself.''
Chairman: ''We have recently interviewed a Mr Cedric Brown who earned
more than 20 times that amount before we even started talking bonuses.
Mr Brown put up a very articulate case for the level of his earnings. Do
you think you can do the same?''
Me: ''I would certainly hope so. I recall that Mr Brown was
accompanied at his hearing by the chairman of British Gas, but
unfortunately my own chairman is not able to be with us today, due to a
Spring run of salmon on th River Carron.''
Chairman: (looking agitated): ''Spring run of . . . Damn. This hearing
is now concluded. But there is a strong chance you may be recalled.''
Me: ''I can't think of anything else I could . . . err . . .''
Chairman: ''Your preliminary written submission did not mention a
Spring run of salmon in the River Carron, for a start. Hearing
dismissed.'' (Bang of gavel as members change into warm tweeds,
ghillie's hats, and rush out).
I wake up, sweating.

<HEADLINE>Ladbroke lobbies for a level playing field with the Lottery.  Pools firm suffers a 15% decline in its turnover</HEADLINE>

THE POOLS industry has been badly affected by the success of the
National Lottery since its inception last November but that is partly
because it is not a level playing field.
Peter George chief executive of Ladbroke, owners of Vernons --
Britain's second largest pools company behind Littlewoods -- said that
the pools companies had been treated ''quite shabbily'' and were
effectively having to compete with one hand tied behind their backs.
In particular he cited the preferential rules governing the Lottery in
areas such as advertising and the roll-over of prize money. He said that
the campaign to get betting duty substantially reduced would continue.
Football pools companies currently pay 37.5% of their revenues in tax
whereas the National Lottery only pays the Treasury 12% of its income.
Vernons turnover has dropped 15% since the launch of the lottery but
the company refused to say how much of the #2.3m fall in profits was
attributable to the lottery. Ladbroke remains committed to the Vernons
business, which remains profitable, although it has had to be
restructured to take account of its declining fortunes with the loss of
95 jobs. Ladbroke has also chosen to make a prudent writedown of #100m
in the brand value of Vernons, effectively valuing it at nothing in the
balance sheet.
However the rest of Ladbroke's betting business, including racing,
continues to prosper. The division made a record profit of #98m last
year on turnover of #2637m.
Deregulation of the UK market allowing evening and Sunday betting,
more attractive shops selling food and non-alcohoic drink and the
ability to establish amusement machines in betting shops all suggest
more profitable growth in the future. Having acquired three casions last
year, Ladbroke hopes to develop the business both at home and abroad to
take account of liberalisation in this sector of the market.
Following the agreed sale of the Texas Homecare DIY business to
Sainsbury's for #290m, Ladbroke will be able to pay off all its
outstanding sterling debt and focus on its core divisions of hotels and
betting.
Its Hilton hotel chain has proved resilient throughout the recession
which is surprising given that 60-70% of its clients are on business.
However it has benefited from its geographic spread worldwide. In what
remains a tough market its operating profit held steady at #126.8m with
the average room rate just 1% higher.
The performance of the business improved in the second half and has
continued in the current financial year, helped by a recovery in demand
in some of the Continental markets such as Germany and the opening of
four new hotels. The UK hotel chain performed well, benefiting from
further strengthening in the economy with good increases in both
occupancy and room rates.
Ladbroke sees further growth potential from opening in City centre
sites where it is currently unrepresented, developing resort hotels for
business customers offering a range of leisure and entertainment
activities such as golf and casinos in addition to conference facilities
and extension of the Hilton brand name into new areas.
The total dividend was maintained at 6p after the payment of a final
shareholders' payment of 3.6p. This followed a jump of 20.3% in annual
profit before tax and exceptional items to #128.5m. Exceptional items
for the year amounted to a charge of #358.3m before tax and included
#201.8m relating to the write-off of reinstated goodwill on the sale of
Texas Homecare. Other exceptional items included a #38.2m provision for
loss on sale of Texas Homecare, #53.4m relating to a fundamental
reorganisation of the Texas business resulting in the closure of 40
outlets and a profit of #75m on the termination of the Hong Kong Hilton
management contract.
Ladbroke shares dipped a penny to 171p.

THE situation Mr and Mrs Wishart find themselves in need not have
happened had they been timeously advised of their right to financial
help from the Department of Social Security.
Under the National Assistance Act 1948, (Choice of Accommodation)
Directions 1992, and various other sections, if Mrs Nellie Berry had
less than #3000 in savings she was entitled by law to weekly help with
fees up to #198.40 per week. This applies even is she owns a house, and
the total rises after April to #204.40 per week.
There are benefits and drawbacks in making this claim which is
mandatory and not discretionary on the DSS.
Advantages are that you do not go near the social work department and
do not get means tested other than for the DSS cut-off limit. It is a
must that to get this help you do not seek help from your local
authority. The main advantage is that no repayment is made even when the
elderly resident dies and the house is sold.
Disadvantages are that under this system the resident does not get a
personal allowance (pocket money). The amount is a little less than one
might get under the Community Care Act, too, but this is more than made
up for in that the daughter or other carer can then keep on a job and
any small top-up payment to the residential home is catered for.
You must use a private home and not a local authority home to qualify.
Most private homes will give very good care for between #194 and #220
per week, and there are many very good homes to choose from. The scare
stories of a very few homes in trouble for poor care practices should
not put people off from using one of the many good private homes.
Full publicity and use of this right would help save Strathclyde
Regional Council social work department an enormous sum every year which
it could spend elsewhere to everyone's benefit, at least until the
Government catches on and changes the law. I have successfully used this
Act.

THE NEW part-paid electricity shares lost further ground yesterday,
dipping to their issue prices at one point before steadying.
PowerGen ended 2[1/2]p lower at 187[1/2]p, just a shade above the 185p
sale price, after touching 183p. National Power was finally 1p down at
175[1/2]p, after a low of 171p, against their 170p issue price.
Northern Electric continued its precipitate decline, tumbling 104p to
793p as dealers assumed Trafalgar House would withdraw its bid. The
company itself was still talking with OFFER, the industry watchdog.
Shares of the other English electricity distributors were all sharply
lower, with analysts unwilling to forecast where they would stabilise.
Meanwhile the storm over the threat of industry regulator Professor
Stephen Littlechild to impose stricter price controls over the
distributors continued and there were widespread calls for the Professor
to resign.
Big investors were furious and there was mutinous talk that they would
try to cancel their cheques. However a spokesman for the Government's
advisers Kleinwort Benson and BZW said they had entered a binding
contract and could not cancel.
David Manning, investment director of Legal &amp; General, which did not
put in for shares, commented: ''I don't expect our institutions to try
and withdraw. It is the sort of thing the Americans might think about
doing.''
Coming after the Barings crash and the current weakness of sterling,
the debacle is another episode to dent the City of London's position
worldwide.
Small investors will no doubt be right behind the British businessman
who reportedly issued a writ against the Treasury and its advisers.

THE public offer of shares in the two English electricity generators
excited my interest on behalf of the portfolio I run for Ludovic
Ranfurly.
I believed that it might be possible to engage in a bit of opportunism
by buying and selling. And, as I had already hinted in an earlier column
that I would go for this issue, I felt obliged to do so though I knew
that the penny piece allotments would be made even worse than usual by
the Treasury's insistence that all applicants be forced to appply for
both stocks. That certainly deterred me from applying for both Ludo and
Gilly his wife.
I bid for 1000 shares for him only and was allotted 255 National Power
and 170 Power Gen. Such allotments make nonsense of intelligent
portfolio management. I can see the Government's point of view -- they
would like to spread a little jam. As it happens I just sold the
allotments through Tilney his brokers first thing on Monday morning,
getting a good price which left him with a profit of #25.
The #25 will go to his cash holdings but it left me moaning until I
read about Professor Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator.
Seldom can anyone in such a position have got a thing as wrong as did
the Professor when he regulated the electricity companies six months
ago. The damage he did when correcting his own inadequacy this week has
been immense. His timing had all the sensitivity of the German advance
through Belgium in August 1914, coming the day after the generators
offer and three days before decision day for the Trafalgar House bid for
Northern Electric.
The two generating stocks are sound enough investments and should be
held by those who are content with small holdings or can build them up a
bit. But the appeal of all utilities has been reduced and the
prospectuses on which they were sold shown to be misleading. Ludo is
lucky not to have had his fingers burned.

GHOSTS from the past continue to haunt T&amp;N as the front line
technology autocomponents group has had to increase its estimate of
current year costs against US asbestosis claims by #10m to about #50m.
In November, the City was shocked when the former Turner &amp; Newall made a
#140m provision against claims which chairman Colin Hope said were made
higher by the ''scandalous behaviour of the American legal profession.''
To preserve cash, T&amp;N is maintaining the 1994 dividend total at 10.85p
but will reduce that for the current year to 6p to save about #35m
including the advance corporation tax.
Pre-tax profits ended 85% lower at #10.7m.
However shareholder loyalty has been encouraged by a remarkably good
trading result with operating profits jumping 47% to #180m after #20m of
exceptional charges. T&amp;N is meeting its performance targets of a 10%
return on sales with a rise in 1994 from 8.7% to 10.3% on turnover 16%
higher at #1936m and has started off 1995 with record production runs to
supply German and French customers.

THE pound staged a partial recovery from a post-war low of DM2.22 in
Far Eastern trading as central bankers appealed for calm on the foreign
exchange markets.
But the Bank of England was not expected to raise UK interest rates in
defence of sterling after a drop in industrial production in January
reinforced other indications that the economy had slowed down.
Continuing turmoil on the foreign exchange markets forced the Bank of
France to impose a 24-hour, 8% lending rate in place of its 6.4%,
five-to-10-day emergency rate after the franc had fallen to an all-time
low of Ffr3.5880 to the German mark.
Denmark, Belgium, and Portugal also increased short-term rates in an
effort to stabilise their currencies within the ERM.
After its overnight battering sterling managed to move up to DM2.2650
in mid-afternoon before ending European trading at DM2.2528, only
slightly lower than on Tuesday despite the exceptional volatility of its
trading range.
But it lost ground to around $1.6175 as the dollar perked up to
DM1.3920 and 90.95 yen, well clear of overnight all-time lows.
Sterling's trade weighted index retreated to 86.0 from 86.5 after a low
of 85.8.
The Bundesbank said the latest movements on currency markets were
exaggerated and not in line with economic fundamentals. It welcomed the
decision by the Bank of France to raise interest rates as well as
assurances by the US that the authorities in Washington believed a
strong dollar was in the national interest.
A call by Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Krupp for lower
German interest rates was thought to represent a minority view within
the central bank.
Later Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said, ''We will see if we
have room for a small rate cut. We will also naturally have to see
whether we should raise interest rates in the foreseeable future.''
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told the House of
Representatives' budget committee that the dollar's weakness was
''unwelcome'', ''troublesome'', and ''very likely overdone''.
The dollar crashed to fresh overnight lows of 88.75 yen and 1.3450
mark despite further intervention by the Bank of Japan, which has become
increasingly agitated about the knock-on effects of the strong yen.
Mr Greenspan also said that the US had very large blocks of marks and
yen to use in the foreign currency markets and its ability to intervene
would not be impaired by the Mexican rescue package.
Concerted intervention by leading central banks late on Thursday and
Friday last week failed to arrest the dollar's decline and was widely
perceived to have been half-hearted and ill-timed.
In London arch-bear Nick Knight said the dollar would remain weak
until US rates were raised substantially.
He added that his February 17 forecast that the dollar would fall to
90 yen and DM1.40 had been surpassed by a large margin and repeated his
prognostication that the Dow would fall to 3200 and the FTSE-100 to 2400
as a weak dollar pushed the US economy to a hard landing.
The stock market took its cue from the fall in output and retrieved
some of its recent losses, but trading was nervous. Sentiment was also
helped by a slight easing in currency tensions and an encouraging batch
of corporate results. The Footsie closed 15.1 points higher at 2992.1.
Industrial production fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in January
against expectations that it would increase by 0.5%. The December figure
was revised down from 0.8% to 0.6% and the year-on-year rate fell back
sharply to 3.7% from 5.3% in December.
Oil production was hit by the bad weather in the first half of January
and oil and gas extraction fell by 1.2% between December and January.
There was all-round weakness in manufacturing output, which fell by
0.6% after gaining 0.5% in December. Year-on-year growth was cut from
5.2% to 3%.
Manufacturing also declined in November. Indeed the Central
Statistical Office revised that fall from 0.6% to 0.9%.
As a result manufacturing edged down 0.1% between the latest two
three-monthly periods, a clear signal that output had slowed to a
snail's pace.
However, compared with the same three months a year ago manufacturing
was 4.3%. The Treasury said the pace of expansion had clearly slowed in
recent months, but business surveys pointed to a healthy manufacturing
sector based on export success.
The latest CBI survey claimed that export orders were at record levels
and last week's Purchasing Managers' survey pointed to a pick-up in the
pace of manufacturing activity after a slowdown over the previous six
months.
James Capel's Adam Cole noted that two-thirds of the January fall in
manufacturing output was attributable to engineering, where the trend is
strongly upwards, but exceptionally volatile with monthly movements of
1% in either direction in recent months.
Retail sales also fell in January, suggesting that the economy got off
to a slow start this year. This provides some encouragement to the
Treasury and the Bank of England that higher interest rates and
increased taxes are restricting growth to a more sustainable pace.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, met the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, for about an hour in the morning. The
currency crisis would have been discussed though it scarcely rated a
mention in the Treasury's monthly monetary report published to coincide
with the meeting.
By mid-morning the pound's trade weighted index was about 2.7% below
its year-end level. Its loss against the mark, offset by gains against
the dollar bloc, was 7.5%.
Strength against the dollar should help to curb inflationary pressures
by reducing sterling-denominated commodity prices, and weakness against
the mark should be good for exports.
But if this went too far some manufacturing sectors could run into
capacity restraints and raise their prices. A rough rule of thumb
suggests that a 3% to 4% drop in the trade weighted index is equivalent
to a 1% fall in base rates.
Thus sterling's weakness has fully offset the 0.5% increase in rates
last month. If this persists it could cause concern to the Chancellor
and the Governor when they meet next month.

* KENNY Dalglish was back on familiar ground last night -- looking
down on the rest of the Premiership.
Blackburn had lost top spot for 24 hours with Manchester United
winning at Wimbledon on Tuesday, but the side, managed and developed by
Dalglish, proved once and for all against Arsenal with a 3-1 win that
when the pressure is really on they do not flinch.
Alan Shearer passed a fitness test on his dodgy knee less than two
hours before kick-off, but the Blackburn striker brought Arsenal to
their knees with two goals -- taking his tally for the season to a
remarkable 31.
Graeme Le Saux also weighed in with a spectacular strike as Blackburn
retained their three-point advantage over United with both clubs having
10 games left to play.
While there was joy for Shearer, it was a miserable night for Ian
Wright. He was dropped to the subs' bench by caretaker manager Stewart
Houston.
Wright replaced John Hartson in 58 minutes, but by then the Gunners
were chasing the game, and they did pull one back through Steve Morrow.

SCOTLAND go into the Grand Slam showdown against England in 10 days
with an unchanged side.
Manager Duncan Paterson, announcing the make-up of the squad at
Murrayfield yesterday, said that the selection meeting on Tuesday night
had been one of the speediest on record. In fact, and in a tone which
indicated that this had not always been the case in recent seasons, he
said that he had managed to get home from Edinburgh to Galashiels that
same night.
There was little doubt that the selectors would keep faith with the
side which demolished Wales 26-13 at Murrayfield on Saturday.
There was, perhaps, a case to be made for bringing Tony Stanger on to
the bench to cover the wing and centre positions, but the selectors have
obviously decided that to tinker with the 21-man squad at this late
stage in the Five Nations' campaign would be to tempt the fates which
have operated so gloriously in Scotland's favour since the tide turned
against Canada in January.
Ever the perfectionist, Paterson declared that although the same
personnel would uphold Scottish honour at Twickenham, there had been
much thought given to detailed analysis of the game against Wales.
''We had a bit more time to look at the video-tapes from Saturday, and
obviously without wanting to take anything away from a tremendous
performance, we did look at certain areas where we could improve.''
Specifically, and no doubt with Rob Jones' second-minute try at
Murrayfield on Saturday in mind, Paterson pinpointed concentration,
first-time tackling, and, without naming them, the necessity for
''certain individuals'' to put in more tackles than they had done
against the Welsh, as being the areas that will require more spit and
polish before the winners-take-all encounter against England.
Paterson underlined the crucial roll now played in international
preparation by the video recorder.
''The big advancement this year is the technology available,'' he
said. ''I'm quite pleased that it wasn't around when I was playing, I
can assure you of that. Individuals are now very closely monitored and
there is no hiding place.''
The SRU has access to all video footage shot by the BBC at Murrayfield
internationals and, using footage provided by 13 cameras from seven
different angles, one of director of rugby Jim Telfer's tasks is to edit
segments showing in comprehensive detail the performance of individual
players.
The type of non-broadcast material which the Scottish coaches make use
of focuses on ''one-on-one'' player situations where the ball is
elsewhere on the park. ''We have looked closely at certain areas, and
while they were minor things they are things that can be put right and
hopefully that will be done before Saturday week.''
The manager said that the Twickenham game represented a huge
challenge. ''It's no secret that England are in the top three nations in
the world at the moment, or at least they should be. We have always said
that we want to be in the top six. A good result against England would
help those ratings along a wee bit.
''But one of the tremendous things in Scotland this season has been
how the squad have taken each step one at a time, and we just hope that
we can take one more very big step on Saturday week,'' he said.
The manager also revealed that the 26-strong World Cup squad will now
be chosen on April 4, two weeks later than planned. This will give more
time for potential squad members such as Alan Sharp, Andy Nicol, Peter
Walton, and Damian Cronin to overcome injury problems. Sharp, Walton,
and Nicol are this week undergoing intensive physiotherapy at the
Lilleshall Sports Injury Centre in Shropshire.
The international squad session at Murrayfield, which is normally
staged on a Sunday before at international, will take place on Saturday.
This, said Paterson, would allow the players, and in particular the
Exiles, to spend a rare Sunday with their families.
The decision to offer a league amnesty to players involved with the
international squad also was applauded by Paterson. ''It takes away the
risk of injury and, given the injury list we are carrying at the moment,
it gives peace of mind that we are not going to lose anybody else. From
that point of view it is very advantageous,'' he said.
Tickets for the Twickenham match are said to be changing hands on the
black market at stratospheric prices. The Scottish allocation of 4800 --
the regulation number for Twickenham -- is sold out and the Scottish
support will be outnumbered in the 60,000 all-seated stadium.

CAMPBELL Ogilvie, the Rangers secretary, has demanded an end to the
constant speculation surrounding the current league set-up which was
agreed just last year.
And Ogilvie warned those who might want change that major sponsors
could be frightened off by the spectre of uncertainty which appears once
more to hang over the national game.
''There have been no talks, behind the scenes or otherwise, among the
clubs,'' he said, ''but it seems that there will always be discussion
about the direction the game should take.
''There were complaints surfacing in November about the four leagues
of 10 and the new set-up had only been going or three months or so. I
just don't think that is good for the game.
''Clubs are trying to sell season tickets just now. We also are trying
to sell executive boxes for the new season, and the whole marketing
exercise is being complicated by all the talk which is taking place.
''People don't want to buy any kind of package without knowing what
will be on offer . . . 18 home league games is a bit different from just
15 league matches.
''And then, of course, you have the sponsors and the television
companies who have paid huge sums of money for a competition they were
told would be in place for a period of five years.
''We don't want to frighten people off who want to put money into the
game. That would be a big mistake.''
Indeed, it is a mistake the clubs made before when the climate of
uncertainty left football without major sponsors for a lengthy period.
Then, commercial executive Bill Wilson, who negotiates on behalf of
the SFA and league, insisted: ''Until things are settled and potential
sponsors can see a clear way ahead, nothing will happen. No money will
come into the game.''
Yesterday Wilson dismissed the rumblings surrounding yet another
change and pointed out: ''I was not scare-mongering before. The proof of
the pudding is there for everyone to see.
''When there was constant talk of chopping and changing, I found it
impossible to attract major sponsors. People want to know what it is
they are putting their cash into.
''When the clubs decided on a long-term plan which would not be
altered for five years, we saw money coming back into the game. Big
money.
''The reason was simple -- the sponsors saw a settled period and they
knew their long-term planning gelled with our own. That is the reason
Coca-Cola came in and Bell's and Sky.''
These deals will bring more than #20m into Scottish football during
the next four years. Further tinkering with the leagues could mean
problems with the companies who are paying these huge sums of cash.
In any case, suggestions that moves are being made to save Aberdeen,
in particular, from relegation seem ill founded. There is a league rule
now in place which does not allow changes to be made to promotion and
relegation issues while the season is on-going.

AS Hearts move towards their Scottish Cup quarter-final match against
Dundee United at Tynecastle this weekend, they could face another
managerial crisis.
Tommy McLean, the man persuaded to take over after he had quit
Motherwell, seems to be growing more and more disillusioned by life in
the capital.
There had been suggestions previously that all was not well at
Tyncastle, even though McLean had dragged his side clear of relegation
and steered them to that famous cup victory over Rangers.
Yesterday, McLean confirmed things were not proceeding to his
satisfaction -- and the hint was there that he may be ready to turn his
back on the club in the summer
He pointed out: ''I could have remained at Motherwell for the next
three years or so and won nothing -- but my job would have been safe.
''It was just that I did not like the way the club was going. I
disagreed with what was happening.
''Things were in place, there were good players there, but I was not
going to be allowed to spend any more money on the team. All the
available money was to go on the new stand.''
Now McLean must feel he is in a time warp, trying to strengthen a team
but forced instead to listen to the bullozers outside as a new ground is
built.
No wonder he feels frustrated. No wonder that one of the outstanding
managers in the country could be ready to leave it all behind.
He admits ruefully: ''The money that there is at this club has to be
spent on the stands. I cannot buy the players I would like.
''Let's face it -- if you spend #50,000 on a player then you get that
kind of value. What you get is a #50,000 player and this club deserves
better than that.
''We need big-time players. That's what we must be able to provide for
the supporters.
''If that is not going to happen, then I will have to look at where I
am going. This is the situation I left behind me.
''There is no way this is an ultimatum to the directors. I am just
stating my position. It's how I feel.''
Hearts will go into the Cup clash without midfielder Jim Bett, but
with the confidence that United have a bad record at Tynecastle -- and
that the holders have lost their last two games in the premier division.
Meanwhile, Falkirk, who drew at Fir Park on Tuesday, have found their
survival fight hit by suspensions as they head for Ibrox on Saturday.
Defender David Weir was sent off in the 2-2 draw with Motherwell and
automatically misses the match, while Steve Fulton and new signing Paul
McGrillen are also out because of suspension.

BEWARE of Greeks bearing gifts and Englishmen singing Scotland's rugby
praises. The canny war of words over Scotland's Grand Slam showdown with
England on Saturday week has begun.
This time around the Englishmen appear to have taken a leaf from
Scotland's 1990 pre-match schedule when, at every opportunity, the Scots
lauded England to the rafters.
They deny it to this day but on March 17, 1990, Will Carling's
Englishmen arrived in Edinburgh over-confident. They had swallowed hook,
line, and sinker the bait offered by the Scots who were admitting to
anyone daft enough to listen that it was going to be a privilege just to
share the same turf with the lilly-whites.
This week already, England manager Jack Rowell has been singing a
paeon of praise for Scotland's Gavin Hastings. The captain, said Rowell,
was ''majestic.'' The team was ''impressive.'' And the Scottish forwards
were playing ''better than 1990.''
Yesterday, Carling chimed in with his own gilt-edged commendation for
the Scots. ''Scotland were very impressive in defeating Wales,'' he
said. ''There is a spring in their team. Their reaction-times and
discipline were good. Their unity and collective will is worrying.
''We were always hoping that we would be involved in playing for the
Grand Slam in this fixture -- but we didn't spend any time forecasting
the fortunes of other teams in the Five Nations.'
''We weren't concerned whether Scotland would be involved in the same
ambition as us, but now that they also have won three matches, it will
make the match a real occasion.''

ABERDEEN will bus their supporters free of charge to Firhill on
Saturday for the vital relegation game against Partick Thistle.
The cash-strapped Pittodrie club, who know their premier division fate
could hinge on the outcome, are prepared to go deeper into debt to get
the backing they need.
Pittodrie supporters' chief Neil McDougall welcomed the move
yesterday, and expects thousands of fans to take up the offer.
He said: ''Chairman Ian Donald told me about the scheme, which is a
tremendous gesture. The club obviously appreciates that this game is
like three cup finals rolled into one.
''I want all Dons fans to rally behind the team in the remaining
fixtures and do their bit to boost the team. I am sure there will be
thousands extra on the gate at Firhill because of this offer.''
Caretaker manager Roy Aitken said: ''I have stressed all along that we
-- players, directors, management, and supporters -- are all in this
together. We share one common aim, to see the club climb out of the
present situation in the league.
''At this stage, our fans have a more important role to play than ever
before. The more we have behind us for such a vital game, the better.
''The club, in association with Grampian Transport, are providing free
buses for those travelling to Glasgow. The players and I appreciate this
initiative.''
Aitken saw Partick Thistle turn up the heat in the relegation battle
by beating Dundee United on Tuesday, and admitted: ''They fully deserved
their victory by showing more willingness.
''It was always going to be a hard game for us down there, but it is
even harder now as Thistle will be lifted by this result.
''It will come down to whose attitude and determination is greatest.
But we will ensure that we are able to handle it.
''Our fate is in our own hands. and I know my players have the
qualities to get us out of trouble. There are nine games left, and a
couple of wins for us will turn the screw on someone else.''
Midfielder Paul Kane is still receiving intensive treatment for a calf
injury in an effort to be fit for Firhill.
* PARTICK THISTLE could be facing a money crisis after they recorded
the lowest premier division attendance of the season.
A crowd of only 2627 turned out to watch Tuesday night's match against
Dundee United, and that has left Thistle officials counting the cost of
their mudbath pitch.
Secretary Robert Reid said: ''A lot of people probably thought the
game would be off, having been postponed five times previously.
''The United fans, in particular, would be unwilling to make the trip
in those circumstances. It was also the start of four home games in
quick succession, and our supporters are now picking and choosing when
to spend their money.
''There are other problems with midweek games, such as football on
televison, that can also affect attendances.
''Tuesday night's attendance was easily our lowest league turnout of
the season, and that figure included all the hospitality.
''However, the 2-0 victory should make it a different story when
Aberdeen visit. That is a vital match, and I expect a much better
attendance.''

THERE were further frustrations this week for Eastwood District
Schools, when their Bank of Scotland Schools Cup quarter-final match
against Queen Victoria School, Dunblane, scheduled for Tuesday, was yet
again postponed.
A win over QVS would give the Glasgow side a place in the semi-final
against Madras College, St Andrews.
The Eastwood formation was the brainchild of Tom Robertson, a former
teacher at Eastwood HS, and draws from five secondary schools in the
south Glasgow area. In addition to Eastwood HS, which has always been a
rugby school, the consortium comprises St Ninians, Williamwood, Wood
Farm, and Mearns Castle.
Robertson's involvement not only continued after his retirement but
increased. ''I took a job as a youth development officer with Clarkston
Rugby Club,'' says Robertson, who reckons that the catchment area is
such that each school should be able to field seperate teams.
Co-operation among the five secondary schools, however, has produced a
situation where they can field teams for each year group. A healthy sign
that rugby is prospering under this system is the fact the Eastwood
District Schools run a second XV in addition to it strong first side.
''Schools rugby is definitely on the increase in the state sector
after reaching an all-time low during the teachers' strike in the
1980s,'' says Roberston.
''I think that there should always be schools rugby. It is the most
efficient way of presenting the sport to youngsters.''
As a youth development officer Robertson thinks that introducing rugby
to primary schools is the best way forward. ''I teach youngsters in
primary schools and then pass them on to local clubs. Thereafter it is
up to the clubs to hold on to them. Also, it is much easier to teach
secondary pupils if they arrive already with the basic skills.''
The success of the district scheme can be measured by the growing
fixture list, which now inlcudes many of the independent schools.
Results against sone of the top schools has been encouraging,
particularly last season when the first XV defeated Keil School. This
season the most heartening result was a draw with Kelvinside Academy at
Balgray.
The most eagerly awaited game this Saturday goes ahead at Auldhouse,
where Hutchesons' and Glasgow HS meet in what should be a quality match
between two successful sides.
Meanwhile, St Aloysius' College, who have also had a frustrating
series of postponements of their quarter-final cup match against Peebles
HS, will try to get the game played today at Millerston.

STENHOUSEMUIR manager Terry Christie is ready to unleash an ''Unknown
Warrior'' in Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final tie with Hibs.
Neil Aitken, 23, a fifth-year student at St Andrews University where
he is studying laser physics and optoelectronics, could make a comeback
for the biggest game in the club's history.
The 6ft-plus defender or midfielder was a regular until suffering a
stress fracture in his right ankle. However, despite the pain, he played
on for more than a year until sufficient cover was available.
Aitken's last first-team appearance was against East Fife in August --
he was on the bench for Tuesday night's match against Berwick -- and he
has managed only one reserve game recently because of the weather.
Manager Christie has no qualms about including Aitken, Stenhousemuir's
longest-serving player, in the cup squad.
He said yesterday: ''Neil has had a horrific time with the injury, but
is a very good player, a terrific athlete, and a fearsome sight when in
full flight.''
Aitken, due to graduate Bachelor of Science this summer, said: ''It
has been a bitter pill to swallow, missing out on the excitement.
''I suppose you could call me the 'Unknown Warrior'. It wold be a
tribute to the manager's confidence to be included against Hibs.''

* JOE Kinnear's crusade against ''diabolical'' refereeing is supported
by the vast majority of Premier League managers, Wimbledon owner Sam
Hammam claimed yesterday.
However, a worried Hammam admitted: ''Joe may need to be crucified to
eradicate inconsistency among referees.''
Kinnear, already facing an FA inquiry after an incident at Newcastle,
could find himself in deeper trouble after being ''sent off'' at
Selhurst Park on Tuesday. He confronted official Robbie Hart on the
pitch and faces the prospect of another protracted touchline ban.
''We expect a disrepute charge on Joe Kinnear and I have some concern
that he will suffer in one way or another,'' Hammam said.
''We have to look at the positive side of what Joe is trying to
achieve; it's in the long-term interests of football and referees.
''The real problem is not Joe Kinnear, but consistency of refereeing
and the quality of officials.
''I can't remember a manager who hasn't complained, including
highly-respected people like Kenny Dalglish and Joe Royle.''
Kinnear was outraged when Alan Kimble was sent off for failing to
retreat 10 yards from a Manchester United corner -- his second
''bookable'' offence.

CELTIC utility man Mike Galloway could still get the transfer to
Leicester City he wants -- in spite of the hiccup that appeared to have
wrecked the deal yesterday.
Last night, Celtic manager Tommy Burns said: ''The problem arose
because Mark McGhee was in bed with flu over the past couple of days.
Now we are back in touch with him and talking about a permanent move for
the player.''
McGhee, a former Celtic striker and now the Leicester manager, was
back with his relegation-haunted side at Loftus Road last night and
hopes to finalise talks today.
Back at Parkhead, Burns refused to confirm or deny rumours linking the
club with Arsenal's 31-year-old striker Ian Wright. Reports suggested
that Wright would join the Glasgow side in a #2m deal on a
#10,000-a-week salary.
Arsenal denied that any approach had been made, and the salary figure
looks well beyond the reach of Celtic. Their highest-paid player,
captain Paul McStay, earns just half that sum.
* PROMOTION and relegation issues will be involved in the midweek
fixtures after the Scottish League arranged a new programme. The
fixtures are:
Tuesday: Premier division -- Partick Thistle v Motherwell. Division II
-- Dumbarton v Stenhousemuir; Morton v Clyde.
Wednesday: Division III -- East Stirling v Montrose.
* DUNFERMLINE defender Gary Paterson was yesterday transferred to
Stirling Albion for a nominal fee.

SKYE Camanachd's controversial Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup fourth-round
tie against Oban Camanachd will not now be played on Saturday.
The island side have lodged an appeal claiming the tie following the
postponement of the match on Saturday, the second time in two weeks it
had been called off.
In a letter to Camanachd Association Secretary Alistair MacIntyre
yesterday, Skye accused opponents Oban of ''deliberately or wilfully''
misleading the president, Duncan Cameron, who took the decision to call
off the game last Friday night.
The match had originally been scheduled for a Saturday morning field
inspection. Skye say in their letter they are sure Cameron would not
have posponed the tie ''if he had been in full possession of the
facts.''
The letter then had to be amended when secretary MacIntyre pointed out
that under the Association's rules, Skye would have to claim the tie and
lodge a #50 appeal fee to have the match halted this weekend.
Skye then followed the official's advice and amended their appeal
formally to claim the tie.

* THREE second-half goals in six minutes from Stirling Albion pushed
Meadowbank Thistle deeper into the Division 2 relegation myre in
Edinburgh last night before just 165 supporters.
Albion manager Kevin Drinkell fielded new-signing Gary Paterrson from
Dunfermline. And he had a happy debut, giving his new club the lead in
74 minutes. His shot was blocked and went spiralling into the air where
Paterrson was first to react, getting his head to the ball and sending
it into the net from six yards.
Joe McLeod was the supplier for Stirling's second goal, scored by
Craig Taggart, with Ian McInnes completing the scoring with a well-hit
shot from an acute angle.

SCOTLAND striker John McGinlay was the toast of Brunton Park last
night when his late winner earned Bolton a 3-1 win on the night -- 4-3
on aggregate -- and a place in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup at Wembley
on April 2.
All had looked lost for the home side when Swindon's Jan Fjortoft
scored 12 minutes into the second half. But a double substitution by
Wanderers' manager Bruce Rioch sparked a fightback.
Four minutes after having sent on former Aberdeen striker Mixu
Paateleinen and Richard Sneekes, Jason McAteer gave the home side a
lifeline by scoring. Then five minutes later Paateleinen netted to leave
extra time on the cards.
But with just two minutes remaining, a mistake by the Swindon defence
left McGinlay to steer the ball home for his sixteenth goal of the
season.
''We showed character to come back like that,'' said McGinlay. ''The
spirit in the team is tremendous and they showed here.''
In the other semi-final, second leg a goal from Robbie Fowler gave
Liverpool a 1-0 success at Crystal Palace, 2-0 on aggregate.
0 Cushioned by Fowler's goal deep into injury time in the first leg,
Liverpool could afford to be patient last night. And they did not have
to wait too long.
Palace looked in vain for an offside flag in 27 minutes as Fowler
peeled off Richard Shaw and raced clear onto McManaman's long ball down
the left.Keeper Nigel Martyn came off his line but Fowler threaded his
low, angled shot into the net.

SOUTH Africa yesterday completed a win against New Zealand by 93 runs
on the final day of the one-off Test in Auckland.
On a remarkable day's cricket, South Africa set New Zealand 275 in two
sessions to win and bowled them out for 181. Seamer Fanie de Villiers
spearheaded the collapse with four for 42, while Craig Matthews picked
up three for 47.
New Zealand went for the runs and at tea appeared to have a good
chance of victory after a run-a-ball partnership of 64 between Ken
Rutherford and Stephen Fleming.
Fleming hit three 4s and a 6 in his 27, while Rutherford scored 56
from 60 balls, smashing the bowling attack to all parts of the ground.
A fine 101 from South African captain Hansie Cronje clinched the man
of the match award and enabled him to declare shortly before lunch at
308 for six.
South Africa 294 (D Cullinan 96) and 308 for 6 decl (H Cronje 101, G
Kirsten 76, A Hudson 64), New Zealand 328 (A Parore 89, B Young 74) and
181 (K Rutherford 56).

THE Scottish Amateur Swimming Association has plugged in to the
Stirling University bursary scheme as a means of further promoting the
sport.
At present there are five swimmers -- Scots Kerry Martin, Pauline
McLean and Forbes Dunlop, plus English pair Susan Colling and Andrew
Lane -- benefiting from a set-up that includes financial assistance and
full-time coaching and back-up facilities.
The aim is to increase the number of swimmers to an annual intake of
eight, and Martyn Woodroffe, Scotland's Director of Swimming, recognises
it as the way ahead.
''It is something that has been talked about for years, and I think it
is an excellent way for our sport to grow,'' he said. ''The SASA have
become involved this year, and we will be doing our best to promote it
all over Britain.''
Next weekend, the Stirling five will get the chance to advertise the
benefits when they compete in the British Universities' championships at
Crystal Palace with the aim of clinching places in the team for the
World Student Games in Japan in August.
The final selection will not be made until after the National
championships at Coventry in July, but posting an early qualifying time
would ease the pressure.

ROYAL Stream, one of the most impressive performers of the season so
far, has earned himself a step up in class at Saturday's Cumberland
Farmers meeting at Dalston.
He has enjoyed effortless wins in confined races at Alnwick and Friars
Haugh, where he trotted up by 20 lengths.
He faces stiffer opposition in the John Peel Men's Open when one of
his rivals will be Mandika, dual winner of open races at Alnwick and
Lanark, and Gunmetal Boy, successful at the Buccleuch last year.
Kevin Anderson plans to run Jimmy River at the Tynedale meeting on
Sunday, believing that his mount will appreciate the extra half mile at
Corbridge.
Press for Action could go well in the Owners' Association race, but he
has unseated David Mactaggart twice this season. Buckle It Up, ridden by
David's younger brother, Jeremy, could be the better prospect.
There are 10 races on the Dalston card and nine at Corbridge next day.

HERIOT Watt, the defending champions, surprisingly crashed out of the
British Universities women's championships yesterday when they were
beaten 2-1 by Bristol in a semi-final.
The Scots looked to be cruising in the early part of the match, and
this viewpoint was substantiated in 16 minutes when Val Neil shot them
into a lead.
With Bristol looking overawed by the occasion, Heriot Watt gave the
impression that the battle would be won long before the interval.
Unfortunately for them, their attack failed to capitalise on numerous
openings, while just before the break, Bristol broke through, forced a
corner, and on three occasions forced the Heriot Watt keeper, Katie
Goldsack, into fine saves.
However, with nine minutes remaining, disaster struck for Heriot Watt.
Firstly, their defence was caught flat footed when Jo Corbett broke
through on the right.
The Scots' rear-guard not only failed to cut out her cross but then to
dispossess Polly Harrison in front of goal. This strike brought about
another tremendous rally from Heriot Watt, but their prospects of
forcing the equaliser disappeared when winger Susan Gilmour was given a
temporary suspension three minutes from time.

EUROPEAN legislation, depicted as the theft of landowners' property
rights, could lead to an increasing number of private estates being sold
to charities and conservation bodies, it was claimed yesterday.
Michael Wigan, owner of Borrobol estate in Sutherland, warned,
however, that ''green'' tourism would not provide the number of jobs
supported by the present system of ownership.
''There will be fewer hotels and keepers, ghillies and dog handlers,''
he told a Scottish Landowners' Federation conference at Battleby, near
Perth. A lot of colour would go out of the countryside and there would
be less money in local economies. He also feared that any jobs created
would not go to existing local people.
''The whole image of the landowner is already being changed by the
erosion of property rights and the accretion of a wide range of
responsibilities,'' he told his audience. ''Estate ownership is becoming
less desirable and that is one reason why so many estates are up for
sale.'' Private individuals did not wish to become responsible at every
turn to the apparatchiks of the regulating agencies, he said.
With the threat of designation under the various conservation
regulations hanging over capital values like the sword of Damocles, an
increasing number of estates would be bought by the ''financialy
favoured'' such as charities which were outside the tax net, he
forecast.
Mr Wigan complained that the new European Union habitats directive was
shrouded in secrecy but could have serious implications for Scottish
landowners. ''What is more alarming is that we have been told by the
Scottish Office not to be alarmed.''
Farmers had already had to face up to restrictions and changes in
agricultural practices demanded by Scottish Natural Heritage, he said.
For the future he feared more compulsion and less compensation for
activities given up by the farmer or landowner.
The concept of Sites of Special Scientific Interest had got off to a
bad start in the North of Scotland, he said. ''Designation has become a
form of penalty. Those favoured by where they live have become the
victims.'' Crofters and farmers might fail to spot an erosion of quality
because it happened so gradually. ''Along comes a strutting official
waving scientific papers and saying: 'Look sharp you fools, this needs
protection'. It may only be because of tradtional land use that there is
anything to designate in the first place.''
In Caithness, he said SNH officials were perceived as ''non-native,
university-bred, theoretical land experts who had never got their hands
dirty''. In addition, each one tended to have a particular specialism
which did not relate to land management as a whole.
''The latest boobytrap for those who have waited 35 years for a forest
to mature is a ban by Highland Region on the weight of vehicles which
can use small roads -- making it uneconomic to remove the timber.''
The chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, Magnus Magnusson, who was
the next speaker at the conference, suggested Mr Wigan had been
''perhaps a teensy bit partisan''.
There was an alarming and frustrating number of myths and
misconceptions about statutory SNH designations, he said. The fact was
that designations worked entirely on the voluntary principle. With
SSSI's, for example, notification that a site was regarded as of special
scientific interest made no difference to the management regime unless
the owner agreed. There was an ultimate deterrent of compulsory purchase
by the Secretary of State for Scotland but that had never been resorted
to.
There were now more than 1300 SSSI's in Scotland and these would
provide the building blocks for UK site protection under European and
international obligations. The ultimate aim of the two European
directives -- the European Wild Birds Directive and the Habitats
Directive -- was to establish a network of sites to protect Europe's
most valuable habitats and species.
Mr Magnusson said that under the European provisions the regime would
be ''tougher'' because of the Government's obligation to conform to the
EU directive. SNH had no intention, however, of using its powers
arbitrarily or frivolously. Despite what had been said, there was no
evidence whatsoever that capital values were reduced by SSSI
designation, he claimed. There was some clear indication that the
reverse was true. There was a premium to be achieved from owning land in
good health and good heart.
''Is it really sensible to value land just on how many stags there are
to be shot or on how many salmon are to be caught, or how many grouse
can be killed in a day?'' he asked. ''Is there not a case for thinking
that the natural heritage of land should be valued as a whole resource
rather than just those specific exploitable aspects of it which, in
themselves, are often vulnerable to outside activities and events beyond
the owners' control?''
The SNH was currently entering into positive management agreements
with site-owners covering nearly 120,000 hectares at a cost of more than
#4m a year, he said.

HERBIE Hide's mentor has been burning the midnight oil, keeping his
diary up to date. The WBO champion's trainer, Freddie King, carefully
notes down his man's progress in the build-up to Saturday's defence
against Riddick Bowe at the MGM Grand Garden, Las Vegas.
Whenever Hide has looked particularly mean, King has picked up his pen
later that evening and recorded the fact on the appropriate date.
And ''Herbie is back to his spiteful best'' is a prominent sentence in
King's personal log. He said: ''Believe me, Herbie is an absolute
gentleman outside the ring.
''But inside it he's a nasty, horrible person. He is an animal between
those ropes. And that's the way he's got to be.
''Once we've activated our plan, there can only be one winner. He'll
come out fighting to keep his title. Okay, Bowe is powerful but, if he
can't hit Herbie, he can't hurt him.
''And Riddick will never be hit as Herbie will do on Saturday. Bowe is
nowhere near as fast either. The preparation and build-up is what's
going to win this fight, that's the way I see it.
''Bowe probably rates as the best heavyweight in the world at the
moment. But, if you look back to his 1988 Olympic final against Lennox
Lewis in Seoul, he turned away and didn't want to know.
''I believe a leopard doesn't change his spots. No one has hit him so
hard since, and Herbie will be the next one to hit him as hard.''
However, that is not the way the bookies see it. Casinos along the
glitzy Strip in the gambling capital of America make Bowe 6-1 ON to move
back into the world title picture, while Hide is a 9-2 shot.

MISOGYNISTS everywhere, read this and tremble. Having been neutered by
newspapers yesterday on International Women's Day, you probably thought
the eulogies on the monstrous regiment were over. But no. Today we give
you yet another female capable of doing men's work -- athlete Liz
McColgan.
But the blunt truth is that, like the fighter pilot who has outgunned
men to climb into the cockpit, Liz is also up to the job.
Her club, Dundee Hawkhill, is to enter her in the national six-stage
road relay a week on Sunday at Kirkintilloch.
The race is normally for men only, but, ''Females may be entered,
subject to scrutiny, as this is predominantly a men's event,'' states
the entry form.
The format of the race, for which entries close on Saturday, is three
laps of six miles and three of three miles.
''I expect to run one of the longer stages,'' says the former world
10,000 metres track champion. ''It will be my final warm-up before the
London Marathon on April 2. I'm also racing a half marathon this weekend
in Portugal.''
* JOHN Regis, whose participation at the world indoor championships
seemed in jeopardy following a thigh injury, will travel to Barcelona
today.
Regis, who strained some fibres a week past Monday while racing in
Stockholm, hopes to contest the 200m, confirmed team spokesman Tony Ward
yesterday. ''The injury has responded well to treatment,'' he said.
The news is a welcome boost to a team depleted by the absence of most
of leading performers, but it is asking a lot for Regis to survive three
rounds on the bends of the Palau St Jordi arena.
The IAAF president, Primo Nebiolo, yesterday said he would make a
personal appeal to Linford Christie -- who has declined to run the 60m:
''If I see him.'' Christie is due in Spain to support the team, though
Britain has already named Mike Rosswess as replacement. Noureddine
Morceli succumbed to similar appeal at the 1993 outdoor world
championships, fuelling speculation that the IAAF paid him.
* UK athletics chiefs this week bemoaned the lack of a 60,000-capacity
stadium which prevents Britain hosting world or European track
championships. But one world athletics event is being staged in Britain
this year -- on Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh.
And yesterday Jim Darby, the Scotland team manager for the World
Mountain Racing Championships, launched an appeal for help. ''I want 50
pipers -- one every 200 metres around the course -- playing something
stirring to set Scottish hearts on fire, and frighten the Italians.''
The event still needs a major sponsor, so Darby can promise no money:
''Just the pride of Scotland -- it could be worth 30 seconds a runner to
our teams.''
If your pibroch is at Scotland's disposal, dial Darby on 0620 893165.
* SOME pointed questions are inevitable on Saturday at the Scottish
Athletic Federation's annual meeting in Edinburgh's Grosvenor Hotel
(1.0pm). It will be the first opportunity for clubs to query more than
#50,000 squandered in the past year.
Officers of the former women's cross-country and road running body
will be smug about having salted #10,000 in a trust. Despite the best
legal efforts of the federation, the money remains locked away, and so
escaped fiscal armageddon.
But some clubs wonder whether it is appropriate for Eleanor Gunstone,
one of the trustees responsible for denying this money to the sport, to
be standing for the post of convenor of SAF's road-running and
cross-country commission.
* MORE than 2000 athletes from 171 schools will line up in eight races
at the TSB Scottish Schools Cross-country championships on Irvine's
Beach Park on Saturday -- the country's biggest athletics meeting of the
winter.
Emma Gorman, defending over-17 girls' champion, will be up against it,
having raced in Britain's world championship trials last weekend, and
may find the challenge of Kristina Gormley too strong.
International track stars Andrew Young and Ally Donaldson are among
the favourites for the over-17 boys' title, but Kevin McAlpine has won
at each of the three other age groups, and has the incentive of making
history if he wins.

SAM Torrance and Barry Lane, playing superbly together, led the charge
as Europe beat Africa 4-0 yesterday in the Sahara Cup over the Royal
Golf Links at Agadir in Morocco.
Lane shot five birdies and Torrance two to beat Tony Johnstone of
Zimbabwe and South African Retief Goosen by 65 to 69 in the opening
match of this better-ball medal contest played on the eve of the
Moroccan Open on King Hassan's private course.
David Gilford and Italian Costantino Rocca beat South African Gavin
Levenson and Moroccan Mohamed Makroune 65-67, Howard Clark and Peter
Mitchell dismissed Wayne Westner and Jeff Hawkes of South Africa 66-70,
and Swedish duo Per-Ulrik Johansson and Anders Forsbrand beat South
Africans John Bland and Ian Palmer 65-68.
European captain Torrance was delighted. ''This is the second time
I've captained Europe and we've won both times,'' he said. ''The
previous time was in the Four Tours championship in Adelaide in 1991.''
The 41-year-old Scot selected the European pairings and said his only
doubt was whether he should play with Clark -- with whom he has enjoyed
success in the Ryder Cup -- or Lane, but he decided to put Clark with
Mitchell, who had never played in this type of event before.
Londoner Mitchell said he was ''very nervous,'' but still shot five
birdies while Clark had only two.
Gilford, who has twice won the Moroccan Open, clearly likes the
course, which is one of the best on the PGA European Tour. ''It's pretty
tight in places,'' he said, ''but you must not be afraid of it.''
Forsbrand, winner of the Moroccan Open last year, and Johansson both
played well, and African captain Johnstone, asked to comment on the
score, said: ''It's never exciting when you are whitewashed. I could sum
it up in one word -- ouch!''
Torrance is joined by 12 others Scots in today's field -- Gordon Brand
Jr, Brian Barnes, Bernard Gallacher, Brian Marchbank, Gary Orr, Andrew
Coltart, Adam Hunter, Ross Drummond, Mike Miller, Stephen McAllister,
Craig Ronald, and Dean Robertson.

* IAN Woosnam came to Florida, to the Honda Classic here in Fort
Lauderdale -- his first golf tournament of the year -- to bring his game
back into shape.
Thus far, the 27 holes he has played in practice have made him only
hopeful, and he was unable to use the practice facilities yesterday
afternoon when a fierce wind storm descended, cancelling the rest of the
pro-am and tossing all of the tents and corporate sky boxes around the
course.
Woosnam will play five straight weeks in America, though he admitted
that his expectations are low. He last played in December at the Johnnie
Walker in Jamaica, and in the interval spent two months ''doing not a
great deal, not touching a club.''
In discussing his chances for the Masters this year, or the other
majors, Woosnam laughed and replied: ''It took me 29 or 30 years to get
one major, it'll probably take me another 30 years to get another.''

With the Glasgow festival programme just completed Keith Bruce
savours the prospect
We are trying to make the festival more accessible. Too much jazz has
a mystique about it. You don't have to understand what the tenor
saxophonist is doing -- if you're enjoying it, that's enough
I MADE no promises about consuming millinery if this year's Glasgow
International Jazz Festival was anything more than disappointing, but I
did hint at concerns about what new director Derek Gorman had in mind.
Not that Gorman, a chap who was brought into the organisation as much
for his business and marketing background as his enthusiasm for the
music, is likely to take his eye off the bottom line.
He inherited a #90,000 deficit and has set himself three years to wipe
it out, but that doesn't mean he and his team have put together a dull
and conservative festival -- just a very varied one.
''This is the best job I've ever had,'' he beams. ''But I'm conscious
of the responsibility to the music and to the city. It's not like simply
putting on a gig. We've had eight years of terrific festivals and there
is a lot of public money involved.''
So what are the sponsors and funders (particularly Glasgow City
Council with its #140,000 investment) going to see for their money this
year? A great deal of music if they have the legs and ears for it.
The only use of the Royal Concert Hall is for a rare jazz set by Andre
Previn in the company of bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Mundell Lowe.
Gorman hopes that the hall's classical concert-going clientele will be
so intrigued to see the other side of the man's musical character that
they will be fighting the jazz aficionados for tickets.
Along the road at the Theatre Royal, the festival returns to its
original home for popular concerts with shows by singer Carol Kidd on
the opening Friday and veteran violinist Stephane Grappelli the
following night.
The closing concert a week later reunites, for the first time in a
decade or so, legendary Glasgow trad-jazz band The Clyde Valley
Stompers, with players reassembling from as far afield as Switzerland
and Canada.
Fans of that sort of good-time music will also be booking for the
Dutch Swing College Band and/or the jump jive of King Pleasure and the
Biscuit Boys, who both have gigs at the Marriot Hotel, where there will
also be a club every night, with Fionna Duncan fronting the resident
band.
By now there will be a few readers grinding their teeth and muttering
into their breakfast pints of real ale about the lack of any
challenging, modern music. To which Gorman might wish to say: you are
part of the problem, not the solution, just as the folk who won't
venture out for an unfamiliar name are missing out.
''We are trying to make the festival more accessible. Too much jazz
has a mystique about it. You don't have to understand what the tenor
saxophonist is doing -- if you're enjoying it, that's enough. There has
been a perception problem with the Glasgow International Jazz Festival,
not a programming one -- John McLaughlin plays great, swinging jazz
guitar.''
And indeed, McLaughlin will be back with a trio as part of an Old
Fruitmarket programme that has been designed to dovetail with the one at
the City Cafe bar in the City Hall. There should be enough there to
please the chaps in the (usually imaginary) goatees and berets.
Here's a taster: Paul Motian's Broadway Music with saxophonist Lee
Konitz; a tribute to Charlie Parker by the Pete King quintet (including
trumpeter Gerard Presencer) with two very special guests, one of them a
renowned US saxophonist; the Jazz Crusaders, now back to using their
full name after their flirtation with pop; and a veritable feast of
trumpeters -- Cuban Arturo Sandoval, South African Hugh Masekela, young
American Roy Hargrove, England's Guy Barker and Scotland's Bruce Adams.
Adams is part of an all-star Scottish band that includes the
festival's two saxophone-wielding musicians-in-residence, Bobby Wellins
and Joe Temperley and guitarist Jim Mullen. Wellins is writing a
commissioned piece for the band and Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra and
Gorman is keen to ''promote the Scottishness of the festival and the
contribution Scottish musicians have made to jazz.''
The first weekend encompasses a youth jazz day on the Saturday (July
1) and Scottish Jazzworks, a showcase for indigenous talent at the
Ramshorn Theatre. The following weekend drummer Tom Bancroft and his
chums once again get the run of the place, this time calling in European
musicians to add to the pandemonium.
Gorman acknowledges that there is a fine line between patronising
people and telling them things they might not already know -- but that's
what he's aiming at with this year's publicity material, including a
jazz festival tabloid which will be distributed with The Herald at the
end of March when tickets go on sale.
Inevitably, however, and despite incentives, like weekend tickets and
venue passes, music fans will make their first investment in the type of
sound they know that they want to hear. Gorman is sure that if they're
wearing ears they won't be disappointed: ''If you like good music we
challenge you not to find something you like.''

IN the euphoric aftermath of the #3m three-year sponsorship of the
women's European Tour by American Express announced this week, the
tour's chief executive, Terry Coates, declared: ''The Scottish Open will
not be allowed to go to the wall.''
Coates added: ''We have already assured BBC TV Scotland (who broadcast
live transmissions last summer) that the tournament will go ahead at
Dalmahoy in August. We are talking to various parties and are
optimistic.''
0 If necessary,some of this week's windfall could be used to keep the
Scottish championship alive.
The #150,000 tournament, which Laura Davies is due to defend from
August 3 to 6, lost its title sponsor, Skoda, after only one association
when the Czech Republic car manufacturer was taken over by Volkswagen.
''Under its new mangement the marketing direction was changed,''
Coates explained. ''But the joint organisers of the tournament, Carnegie
Management and Parallel Media Group, are out there, working together.''
Scottish commerce's notorious reluctance to back sporting events in its
own backyard may yet be overcome.

WHEN the TAP Rallye De Portugal reached last night's rest halt in
Povoa De Varzim, Colin McRae, driving a Subaru Impreza, was in fourth
place, 1min 11sec behind his team-mate and rally leader, Carlos Sainz
from Spain.
After having retired from the first two rounds of this year's world
rally championship, 26-year-old McRae, from Lanark, and co-driver Derek
Ringer, from Glasgow, made a careful start, recording sixth fastest time
on the first of the scheduled 31 timed special stages.
They moved up into fourth place by the end of the third stage, gaining
one place when the British-built Ford Escort of Francois Delecour hit
trouble.
Delecour overturned his car when he tried to save a few seconds by
cutting a tight corner. ''I cut a slow corner and touched some big rocks
on the inside,'' said the Frenchman. He continued minus a windscreen and
power steering and his misery ended in stage five when his car stopped
with oil pressure failure.
Over the first six damp and muddy dirt road stages, last year's
winners Juha Kankkunen, from Finland, navigated by Welshman Nicky Grist,
were uncatchable in their Toyota Celica and moved into a 13-second lead
over Sainz. After the icy tarmac of January's Monte Carlo rally and last
month's snowbound Swedish rally, Kankkunen, four times world champion,
said: ''It is a nice change to feel some earth under our wheels.''
On more familiar stages around Fafe, the most northerly point of the
event near the Spanish border, Sainz attacked and snatched the lead on
the eleventh and final stage before the overnight halt.
In third place is the Toyota of reigning world champion Didier Auriol.
The third Impreza from Subaru, crewed by Richard Burns, from Reading,
and Robert Reid, from Perth, restarts today's second leg in eighth
place. Today's leg includes 10 timed special stages and 150km of
competitive driving.
The 1700km rally finishes in the Atlantic resort of Figueira Da Foz
tomorrow evening. Interim results after 11 of 31 special stages:
1, C Sainz/L Moya (Subaru Impreza) 2hr 07min 51sec; 2, J Kankkunen/N
Grist (Toyota Celica) 2-07.57; 3, D Auriol/B Occelli (Toyota Celica)
2-08.35; 4, C McRae/D Ringer (Subaru Impreza) 2-09.02; 5, A Schwarz/K
Wicha (Toyota Celica) 2-10.5; 6, B Thiry/S Prevot (Ford Escort) 2-11.35.

PETER Nicol survived a closer than expected encounter against fellow
Scot Martin Heath to claim his place in today's quarter-finals of the
Andersen Portuguese Open in Lisbon.
The No.4 seed now meets Australia's world No.9 Anthony Hill, with a
match against world No.1 and defending champion, Jansher Khan, the
likely reward for the winner.
Nicol, 21, went into the match against Heath as odds-on favourite,
having won the Scottish Championship final easily in December.
He did win in straight games, but Heath, ranked 33 places lower, had
his chances to cause an upset before going out 15-13, 17-15, 15-8 in
just under an hour.
The second game was crucial. Heath, who has never beaten his fellow
countryman as a senior, led 9-7 and 10-9 then fought back from 14-11
behind to level the scores and force Nicol to three set points.
However, on the fourth game ball the more experienced player clinched
the marathon 26-minute game by 17-15 and Heath's chances of a famous
victory had really disappeared.
While the 21-year-old from Oban could be happy with a performance that
proved he could soon join Nichol in the upper echelons of the world
rankings, the victor was less than overjoyed.
''I wasn't too pleased with the way I played,'' said London-based
Nicol who, worryingly, has recently suffered a lengthy bout of
tonsillitis for the second time in a year.
He insists he is fully fit, but that may just be a cover.
Today's encounter against Hill could be billed as the battle of the
crocks.
The Australian was a straightforward 15-17, 17-16, 15-3 winner over
England's Paul Johnson, but he readily admitted to feeling sickly and
even went as far as paying a visit to a local doctor.
For Nicol, there are only happy memories of their one previous
meeting, in the 1993 Singapore Open final when the Scot won to record
his first major success.
Results:
Jansher Khan (Pakistan) beat Paul Steel (New Zealand) 15-5, 15-11,
15-6; Peter Nicol (Scotland) beat Martin Heath (Scotland) 15-13, 17-15,
15-8; Anthony Hill (Australia) beat Paul Johnson (England) 15-7, 17-16,
15-3; Rodney Eyles (Australia) beat Danny Meddings (England) 15-9,
17-16, 13-15, 15-9.

PAUL Weir, Scotland's two-time world champion, will defend his World
Boxing Organisation light-flyweight title in his home town of Irvine on
Wednesday, April 5, against Renato ''Ric'' Magramo of the Philippines.
Amazingly, it will be the little Scot's fifth world title contest in
10 fights as a professional, having previously held the straw-weight
crown. He gave that up and won the vacant light-fly title in Irvine last
November by outpointing South Africa's Paul Oulden.
And yesterday, 27-year-old Weir expressed his delight at making his
first defence at the Magnum. ''I have made no secret of the fact that I
want to fight in Scotland all the time, and to do so in my home town is
a bit special.''
His manager, Tommy Gilmour, who will promote the show, said: ''This
was Paul's decision alone. I am as patriotic as anyone, but I would have
been happy to take the huge offer which was on the table for Paul to
fight in South Africa.
''After all, it's my job to get the best deal I can for my boxers.
Paul, however, is taking half the cash he could have earned elsewhere
just to fight in Scotland.''
The champion added: ''I've won my two world titles in Scotland, and
before I call it a day I would like to win the flyweight crown here as
well.
''Why should I go away when I'm happy here and happy with the money?
What's the point of facing the heat, humidity, and hostility when I can
enjoy myself here?
''Don't get me wrong,;we're all in this game to make as much money as
possible, but if I can make it easier for myself by getting fights at
home then that's what I'll do.
''That way I'll live to fight another day and keep myself on course
for my target of winning three world titles, making a fair bit of money
and retiring before I am 30.''
Certainly, Weir will be a big favourite to beat the 31-year-old
Magramo, who, in his last contest, won the Philippines championship.
The man from Manila has only just come into the top 10 rankings and,
although a tough little fighter, has had 12 losses and three draws in
his 42 professional contests.
The name may sound familiar to the older generation of boxing fans in
this country. Perhaps they may remember Magramo's father, Ric, being
outpointed by former world flyweight champion Walter McGowan at Paisley
Ice Rink in November, 1963.
Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn, the middleweight from Tranent, will
feature in the main supporting bout at Irvine against a selected
opponent, and Gilmour said:
''Willie has all but served his apprenticeship and should shortly be
fighting for some kind of championship.''
Others Scots on the bill will be Ian McLeod (Kilmarnock), Hugh Collins
(Stirling), Mark Breslin (Barrhead), and Joe Townsley (Cleland). And
there should be an explosive battle at flyweight when unbeaten Keith
Knox, of Bonnyrigg, goes in against Anglo-Scot Louis Veitch, the Central
Area champion.
Top price for the show is #40 with the other tickets priced at #30 and
#20.
* SACRAMENTO has been chosen as the venue for Lennox Lewis's final
eliminator for the WBC heavyweight championship against American Lionel
Butler on May 13.
It was one of four cities in the running for the fight, the Briton's
first since he lost the WBC title to American Oliver McCall at Wembley
last September.
Dublin, Reno, and Las Vegas were also in contention, but the
15,000-seater Arco Arena -- home of the Sacramento Kings NBA basketball
team -- came up with the best offer.

ALL European indoor dates for R E M's current world tour, including
the two due to have taken place on April 16 and 17 at Glasgow's SECC,
have been cancelled following the brain haemorrhage sustained on-stage
in Switzerland last week by their drummer, Bill Berry.
However, all their European outdoor dates, due to take place later in
the summer, will go ahead as planned.
From Monday, SECC ticket-holders will therefore have two choices. They
can either claim a refund, or pay a small additional amount in order to
exchange their tickets, originally priced at #19 and #21, for #23
tickets for R E M's outdoor Scottish show, scheduled for July 27 at
Murrayfield Stadium.
Having undergone successful surgery to clip a ruptured aneurysm on the
outer surface of his brain, Bill Berry has been making a steady
recovery. Swiss doctors are confident that he should be discharged from
hospital within eight to 10 days.

IWAS thinking about sex the other day. We in the Tory Party think of
practically nothing else, as you must have gathered by now, and spring
has also sprung in the SNP. Mr Robert Hughes has an affair and resigns
from the Government; Ms Roseanna Cunningham has one yonks ago and has
had to withstand the wrath of the wicked Winnie of the North.
How obsessed we are becoming by the necessity to prove our politicians
are whiter than the driven snow. Selection committees will soon be
employing private detectives to check on the background of the
candidates.
Are there skeletons rattling in your cupboard, Councillor? Bones and
bones of them, my dears, but you would not wrench them from my lips
without applying the burning coals. Why don't you mind your own
business? But it is our business to know whether public figures can be
trusted because if they cheat in their marriages they might do the same
in their task of representing us. Yes, they might but there is little
evidence to suggest such is likely to be the case.
Cecil Parkinson and David Mellor were rather effective ministers as I
recall. Prime Ministers Wellington, Palmerston, and Lloyd George would
not have passed the fidelity exam, Presidents FDR and JFK would have
failed it miserably.
Yet the modern Pharisees, who set standards they rarely live by
themselves, continue to demand their sacrificial lambs. A new book,
published this week, hurries to their cause.
Dr Patrick Dixon, a 37-year-old happy husband, the father of four
children, is the author of the tome in which he thunders: ''We worship
two things in life -- sex and cash.'' Sexual promiscuity, he insists, is
the cause of all society's ills, it is simply too expensive to tolerate.
Why, three out of four married men who have affairs will be divorced by
their wives. (What is the figure for the other way round, I wonder?)
It all stems from the swinging sixties, folks, although some of us who
were around at the time don't remember them being quite so explicit or
exciting. Dr Dixon, however, can even put a price on our affairs; they
have cost the nation ''#124 billion over the past 40 years''.
Ecky thump -- that's a bit of a choker. How does this non-money
worshipping moralist calculate this sum? His bill includes the lost
earnings of the 1500 people who die each year from Aids, all screening
and treatment for cervical cancer, the approximate cost of second homes,
half the annual bill for children in care, 175,000 divorces per year and
the cost of benefits and loss of earnings of single mothers.
Hang on there, Doc, there seems to me to be a few flaws in your
diagnosis. You don't actually have to be promiscuous to catch Aids, not
all cervical cancer sufferers have slept around, the sole cause of
divorce is not a bit on the side.
There are women, even as you read, who are enduring domestic violence
on a horrific scale. There are families whose lives are being torn to
bits by drink or drugs. There are children who are being regularly
abused. The message to them cannot be to shut up and stay put.
Separation does hurt children; listening to rowing parents night after
night damages them a lot more.
Dr Dixon and his wife waited until they were married before they had
sex. Good for them. They waited several years to have children.
Wonderful. He might have waited a bit longer, gathered a little more
experience of married life before pontificating.
For Dr Dixon is of the ''all we need to do'' school of moralising. All
we have to do is stay in our own beds and evils like crime and
unemployment will vanish into the air. Oh, and I am pretty sure he
believes Mum should always be the one who stays at home with the kids,
too.
Forgive me if I decline to swallow the sugared pill. I was divorced;
the main fault for the breakdown of the marriage was certainly mine.
Yet, while I sincerely regret the hurt that was caused, I am not at all
sorry that the split was made and I do not believe it would have helped
a single member of my family if we had stayed in the unhappy alliance.
If we wish to ease the strains on family life we should look very
carefully at the stresses we pile upon the institution of marriage. Our
work rate for a start.
Politicians are the worst sinners -- who would willingly opt for the
sort of hours they choose to endure? We should also look at ways in
which young women, and mothers, can pursue their careers without feeling
guilty.
We might consider not so much a minimum wage but a maximum shift. If
lorry drivers and airline pilots are restricted in the time they are
allowed to be on duty, do the rest of us not deserve the same
consideration? To be fair to Dr Dixon he has some ideas, higher child
benefit, increased ''wedding anniversary'' tax allowances, though,
surprisingly, he does not tell us how much they will cost. But even
those will hardly banish infidelity.
There should be fiscal advantages in being married rather than simply
living together. In encouraging people to be wed, however, we should
never condemn them to a life of misery when the relationship goes wrong.
There is a price to be paid for that, too.
* The Rising Price of Love by Dr Patrick Dixon is published by Hodder
and Stoughton.

IF there wasn't a good deal of back patting going on after the
inaugural concert of the Jazz Co-op, then there certainly should have
been. This new organisation made a triumph out of what could have been a
disaster.
The scheduled headliner for this crucial gig (for which members of the
Co-op had put up the cash) was saxophonist Scott Hamilton, but he pulled
out at the eleventh hour because of illness. Rather than cancel the
event, the Co-op took a risk and co-opted British trombonist Roy
Williams into playing as substitute.
The risk paid off. And probably with dividends. Not only did the
packed Moir Hall (no-one left when on discovering the programme change)
get one of the world's top trombone men, but everyone there will get a
discount on their ticket for Hamilton's rescheduled gig, on April 25.
Appropriately enough, the Co-op was launched to the tune of A
Beautiful Friendship; the first of a selection which balanced the
oft-heard with the seldom-played. In the latter bracket was Up With the
Lark -- a delightful Jerome Kern waltz which, Williams informed us, has
only been recorded twice, by Stan Getz and Joyce Grenfell.
Richard Rodgers' most sublime composition, My Romance, was --
unusually -- delivered almost defiantly; Williams clearly au fait with
the emphatic nature of the lyrics. The sentiments of That's All --
suitor stating his case -- similarly shone through. This was the kind of
smoochy number for which you save the last dance.

SUCH research as there is, and it isn't much, indicates that the
majority of computer users are middle-class white men with college
degrees. Approach the Internet, though, and the first thing you notice
is that expensively-educated twenty-first century boy can't spell, can't
punctuate, and thinks syntax is what you pay for downloaded porn.
Sometimes language within this parallel universe is so nearly private
as to be incomprehensible. Symbols and acronyms swirl in a mist of teen
slang and college argot. Neologisms -- ''spamming'', ''flaming'',
''newbies'' -- evolve and die like single-cell organisms. Serious
discourse jostles with dumb gossip. For the beginner the problem, ironic
amid a communications revolution, is understanding a word.
None of it amounts to a linguistic shift -- ignorance presages few
revolutions -- but as an example of global English the Net is
depressing.
The digital revolution tends to inspire excitement or fear. For those
who have just found the biggest toy in the world, the freedom of the Net
is the model for a new kind of democracy. For others, there is only
apocalypse, the end of books, of literate culture, and of real human
intercourse.
Both schools are wrong, but neither completely so. Missionaries for
the Net, eager as early Christians for electronic miracles, face the
obvious problem that computers haven't abolished reality. On-line
liberty, with its absolute freedoms of speech, thought, and (virtual)
assembly, makes nothing happen. Crime and poverty continue, whatever
pretty pictures form on your screen.
The prophets of doom are equally determined to understand only one
message. Arguments in the US (among those still capable of conducting
one) have reached the point where mass literacy has been given up as a
lost cause and ''oral development'' is the issue. The worry is not
whether children will learn to read but whether they will learn to
speak.
Blame the screen, say the terrified. It's not the garbage that pours
from a TV that matters most, though it matters, but that a child
passively consuming television is not talking to parents or peers. The
same is true of computers, perhaps more so, what with their addictive
games, their mute obedience, and their enforced solitude. Speech is the
foundation on which literacy is built. Speechless, the young think only
in images.
Newspapers, obsessed with making reading easier, with making articles
short and pictures big, don't help. In all this, needless to say, books
are an elite joke.
But hold on. One simple truth about the information revolution is the
extent to which it depends on text. You can't use the Net unless you can
read and write, however ineptly. After the telephone age, e-mail is
rehabilitating the simple letter, albeit digitised, as a form of mass
communication.
Similarly, entire books are already on line. True, you can't access
them like paperbacks, nor stuff them in your pocket for a day at the
beach, but that is, technologically speaking, a minor obstacle. The
nature of narrative will change -- ''interactive''' being the gruesome,
operative word -- but narrative, central to all communication, will
persist.
The parallel fear that newspapers will cease to be is another fantasy.
Some, like the Daily Telegraph, are on-line now, while extracts from
this paper appear in one of CompuServe's many ''forums''. People will
use papers differently, but news and comment will remain assets for
service providers. Reading is being encouraged, not discouraged.
Computers are likely to abolish paper rather than words, or at least
change the relationship between them, but it's not clear if that's a
tragedy.
Think of the obvious: a CD-ROM can store an encyclopaedia. The art of
book-binding may die, words will not. Software exists which will, even
while you sleep, ''customise'' a private newspaper from nominated
sources, pull together text and photographs, and print the lot in a
package shorn of advertising.
Yet if the medium is truly the message, what is it saying? First, that
our relationship with text is changing faster than at any time since
Gutenberg. Secondly, that digital technology, left to itself, will split
society in two.
Computers cost money; getting on line costs more. If information is
power the poor are impotent. The information-rich are acquiring more
wealth, digital and literal, while the poor, unable to use or afford
shiny laptops, become more impoverished, intellectually and materially.
New Age netsurfers, preaching of empowered masses, hate such talk,
just as those proclaiming the death of the book forget that literature
has coped since the epic of Gilgamesh was a hand-chiselled Babylonian
best-seller. The point is that the ability to defeat poverty by picking
up a book and starting to read will soon be a thing of the past.
Call it the information trap. If anyone wants to worry about the
underclass, this is the place to start.

0''I'm just a wee Scottish Catholic homosexual,'' he replied. Eddie
Linden -- for those who don't know -- is the founder and creator of one
of the UK's most influential poetry magazines, Aquarius.
A hob nobber with London's great and good and a legend in his own
lifetime. Fostered out, barely literate, the illegitimate offspring of
an Irish mother who moved to Glasgow, he has yet managed to create a
niche for himself through his abiding love of words and language.
Clearly respected and admired as an editor and publisher on a
shoestring, Axel Pedersen's seedy bedsit would seem to suggest that,
despite his literary fame, potential destitution is but a stone's throw
away.
William Tanner's intriguing play (based on a book by Sebastian Barker)
comes therefore as a kind of object lesson and celebration of the
humanising power of art. It is also, however, a cautionary tale for
Tanner introduces a Pinteresque young intruder -- Stuart (played with
seductive charm by Dallas Campbell), a gay, literary scavenger in every
sense, a contrast in generational, sexual, and artistic attitudes to
Eddie. Where ex-public schoolboy Stuart is brashly confident, working
class Eddie is diffident and inhibited, an unashamed romantic still.
As Eddie, Michael Deacon is a touching, if somewhat overblown innocent
(misleadingly so if the slight, dapper real live Eddie in the bar is
anything to go by) but memorable enough as this self-styled ''liberal
socialist'' who at 60 continues to ply his own distinctive, gently
rebellious furrow.

NEW Moves Across Europe continues to impress. The latest double-bill
featured two strongly individual women whose solos were a celebration of
dynamic technique, creative curiosity and personal integrity.
Silence is a rhythm too is a product of intense, trusting
collaboration between Ellen van Schuylenburch, Indian dance-maker,
Daksha Sheth and musician Shrikanth Sriram.
Van Schuylenburch is, to begin with, a thrilling performer. As the
music booms and resonates, her lithe, disciplined limbs carve out
sculptural shapes that hint at points of origin. Fiercely beautiful,
compelling stuff.
Alcool -- choreographed and performed by Desiree Delauney -- was
compelling but ferociously unsettling.
Clothed or naked, Delauney radiates a kind of visionary fervour.

WHEN Ena Lamont Stewart's hospital drama was first performed by
Glasgow Unity Theatre in 1945 the setting was contemporaneous, but in a
later re-write Stewart rooted the action in the twenties. This version
by second-year BA students is a composite of both scripts and is located
in the forties, in a ''non-wartime period'' which, considering the
references to the Gestapo and lipstick shortages, must be post-war
Glasgow.
The liberation of women which the war facilitated is stifled on the
wards of Rutherston General Hospital, where the concept of career women
owes more to Florence Nightingale martyrdom, with Sister Barton stalking
the polished corridors proclaiming she is wedded to her vocation and
inspiring a reign of terror.
Out of earshot the nurses are not such a cowed bunch, with amusing
exchanges between the girls whose burning vocation seems to be to
grab-a-guy. This spawns much comedic interludes and romantic intrigues
which the cast make much of, with some sturdy character acting, but they
fail convincingly to convey the dramatic tensions underpinning the
various relationships. Many of Stewart's more insightful lines are
thrown away and the production needs a subtler touch to save itself from
being reduced to a nurses 'n' doctors soap opera.
However, Rosemary Chivers manages to evoke a vulnerable soul behind
the formidable armour of Sister Barton, and Dawn-Claire Robertson's
chatty telephonist, Miss Hart, is nicely pitched. Alasdair McCrone's
direction is turgid at times but any turgidity was instantly relieved
with a fantasy sequence, a la Dennis Potter, where Miss Hart dances with
four tuxedoed chaps like a twinkle-toed Ginger Rogers.

A CHALLENGING and totally incomprehensible opening slot from MC
Hurricane, the Beasties' regular DJ, indicated that the rapper's message
would be swallowed by the booming bass. A pity since the Hurra's
unbroadcastable material is destined rarely to be heard.
But rap is not all you get from the Beasties anyway, and certainly it
plays little part in Jon Spencer's universe unless you count repeated
crys of ''blues explosion''. This is not the blooze as ye know it, but a
wondrous weird and mutant thing, part Hendrix (as a real voodoo child)
part psycho-billy wildman. Spencer, formerly of the attitude-laden Pussy
Galore, is howling at your door. He is bad medicine and surprise support
act of the year.
The Beasties emerge crying ''Yo!'' (like you do) but transform
themselves instantly into the Dead Kennedys. Then it's Take DAT: tape
carries the load while the Beasties rap, shoulders hunched, arms waving,
fingers pointing (impossible to tell what any of this is about, but a
couple of the tracks sound pretty good).
Then MC Adam picks up a fuzz-bass and makes thunder like Jack Casady
from the Airplane of old. After which the Beasties become the Clash,
then (for the old folks) the Brian Auger Trinity, and even (yikes!)
Santana and Sly Stone. A grand musical tour that is stylish,
accomplished, witty, and fun.
The Beasties are punk pranksters who wrote the book of white rap years
ago. Obviously they love their record collection. May they never grow
old.

A NEW attempt to ban discrimination against the disabled in Scotland
was launched in the Commons yesterday.
Labour MP Gordon McMaster (Paisley South) gained a formal first
reading for his Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) (Scotland) Bill without
debate.
The measure would set up a Disability Rights Commission to enforce
anti-discrimination laws and improve access to polling stations for the
disabled.
It is among several launched by Opposition MPs who claim the
Government's Disability Discrimination Bill, currently before
Parliament, does not go far enough.
The Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, introduced by Labour's Harry
Barnes (Derbyshire North-East), gained its second reading last month.
However, it stands no chance of becoming law without ministers' support.
There was a row last year over a similar measure when it was blocked
after Tories tabled a huge list of amendments.

William Russell reviews Demi Moore's latest, hugely controversial
film, tries to decipher another Jodie Foster Oscar-nominated role, and
considers John Candy's last screen performance
New releases Disclosure (18)
Directed by Barry Levinson
Nell (12)
Directed by Michael Apted
Wagons East (PG)
Directed by Peter Markle
All on general release from tomorrow.
Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle (15)
Directed by Alan Rudolph
At Glasgow Film Theatre from tomorrow.
SEXUAL harassment of men by women is all the rage. Barry Levinson's
latest film, Disclosure, based on a Michael Crichton novel, although
unashamed tosh, rides the bandwagon in great style. It is one of those
films which has its cake and eats it, because the harassment in question
is physical, which allows the staging of an aggressive sex scene between
the stars -- or their body doubles.
The American cases which have been reported, however, are not about
men being raped by women, but about the poor boobies having to endure
girl talk all day long at work, or face up to suggestive remarks about
parts of their anatomy.
In other words, women in power, because sexual harassment is all about
having power, do to men what men in power do to women.
Michael Douglas, Hollywood's most put upon leading man -- the women
who have abused him include Kathleen Turner, Sharon Stone, and Glenn
Close -- is now ravaged by Demi Moore, who certainly has the muscles for
the task. They both work for different branches of a Seattle-based
computer company. When he is passed over for the top job she gets it.
Ten years earlier they had had a steamy affair, and have not seen each
other since. He is happily married and has two children. Ms Moore, once
installed in her new office, invites him up for an after-hours drink and
chat. No sooner is he inside her lair, and the white wine poured, than
she throws herself upon his body, suggesting they resume where they left
off.
He is tempted, but after ripping off her knickers, decides better of
the whole thing, does up his flies and leaves. Next day she accuses him
of sexual harassment. Furious, he returns the compliment. The sexual
harassment issues are well enough argued, but soon abandoned because the
film changes direction and we are embroiled in a chase up and down the
information highway as Douglas tries to save his job.
The trip through the recesses of the firm's computer with the aid of
an amazing virtual reality machine is very gripping and, in spite of the
fact that the story is basically arrant nonsense, the film does
entertain which is more than can be said about Nell.
Produced by Jody Foster, directed by Michael Apted, it is one of those
movies in which a female star plays someone who is disabled, although
not so it affects her looks, in order to get an Oscar nomination, which
has duly happened.
Foster is Nell, a wild woman of the woods whose existence is
discovered after the death of her mother. She speaks an incomprehensible
tongue and is painfully shy. She could be an idiot, but she is not, as
the handsome GP from a nearby town, Liam Neeson, who finds her,
realises.
A lady therapist from the state university, Natasha Richardson, is
dispatched to research the situation and she and Neeson establish a
relationship with Nell. But the wicked media find out and the idyll is
over.
The subject is potentially interesting, and Apted, a distinguished
director of documentaries, tries to give the absurd goings on some sense
of reality, while Neeson does his best with an improbable role.
But nothing can disguise the fact that Foster's prancings, mouthings,
and frantic hand gestures are other than those of a Hollywood star
shrieking ''Gimme, gimme another Oscar''. Boredom reigns from start to
finish.
Better by far, but shamefully not nominated in this year's ladies'
list, is Jennifer Jason Leigh in Alan Rudolph's Mrs Parker and the
Vicious Circle. It examines the life of Dorothy Parker, poet, wit,
critic, Hollywood scriptwriter and drunk, one of the influential group
of writers, painters, and poets who lunched at the round table in the
Algonquin Hotel in the 1920s and wrote much of the New Yorker.
It is a marvellous performance which manages to encompass Parker as a
young woman high on words and whisky, and then as an old woman in the
depths of cynicism and despair.
Dorothy Parker comes across as enchanting, repellent, vicious, and
loving, but above all sad. She was a woman, as somebody says, with ''a
passion for unhappiness''. Her marriages were disastrous, her love
affairs just as bad, her abortions numerous, and her suicide attempts
frequent.
Jennifer Jason Leigh's decision to imitate Parker's voice is the one
flaw in her performance. Dorothy's accent was at times impenetrable and
this affects comprehension of some of the verse which she recites.
Immaculate support is provided by Campbell Scott as Robert Benchley, her
closest friend, but never her lover, and the large supporting cast who
play the assorted Algonquin wits, notably Wallace Shawn as the hotel's
maitre d' who has the bright idea of the round table.
The film is handsome to look at, and the decision to shoot the
latter-day Dorothy in Hollywood in the late 1930s and in New York in the
1950s in black and white, is inspired.
Parker's reputation as purveyor of wit, wisdom, and cynicism, and a
user of words beyond compare, is well portrayed. The film rambles
slightly, but it remains the best thing Rudolph and Miss Jason Leigh
have done.
Peter Markle's Wagons East is a hilarious spoof western starring John
Candy. The basic premise is inspired. Having gone West, a group of men
and women decide the place has not lived up to expectations, abandon the
town of Prosperity, and head back East just as the raiload and the
government launch a great land race.
These misfits, spoiling things by heading in the wrong direction, have
to be stopped. Candy, in his last film, and a splendid cast make the
most of the material, especially John C McGinley. He plays a gay
bookseller who decides at the end of the long, long trail that maybe he
has not given the West a chance, announcing, as he rides off into the
sunset, that he has heard of this place called San Francisco.
It is well worth going along for the ride.

NICOL STEPHEN, who for five months was Liberal Democrat MP for
Kincardine and Deeside, has decided to give up his ambitions for the
seat and switch his attention to the new Aberdeen South constituency.
The Aberdeen lawyer won the seat at a November 1991 by-election but
lost it in the subsequent General Election to Tory Mr George Kynoch.
At that time, Mr Stephen, 34, pledged to continue to serve the
constituency, to which he had been committed since before the 1987
election, and to win it back.
Now, in the light of the parliamentary boundary changes, he has
decided to move on and is one of the six Liberal Democrat applicants for
the candidature at Aberdeen South.
Mr Stephen, who is still prospective candidate for Kincardine and
Deeside, said he believed both seats winnable and it was a tough
decision as he had represented a major part of both areas during his
time as MP.

MICHAEL Apted has a low opinion of the off Broadway play, Ideoglossic,
on which his film, Nell, starring Jodie Foster in an Oscar-nominated
role, is based, writes WILLIAM RUSSELL. ''It was so far off Broadway,
you could not see it,'' he said. ''It is, frankly, not a very good
play.''
A producer, who acquired the rights, showed the play to Foster, and
seven attempts at writing a script followed.
The problem was getting beyond the play's romantic love story between
a young doctor and a girl he was helping, who had grown up in isolation
speaking an invented language. The rights were then sold to Fox, and the
dramatist William (Shadowlands) Nicholson brought in to rewrite the
script. It was Nicholson who turned the whole project round, he said.
Foster then decided she did not want to direct the film, but to play the
girl -- the film is made by her production company -- and that was where
he came in.
''I only read the play as part of my research,'' he said. ''My agent
sent me the first draft of the script and after a week Jodie gave me the
job. I went to Portland, Oregon where she was shooting Maverick, and we
did a huge amount of work on it. There were a lot of changes.''
He thought Foster had picked him because she thought it a good idea to
have a director with experience of making documentaries. Nell is about a
young girl found living in a mountain shack after the death of her
mother, who had given birth to her as the result of rape and had fled
from society.
She speaks in an unintelligible language. A young doctor, played by
Liam Neeson, from the nearby town, and a speech therapist, played by
Natasha Richardson, sent by the state social work department, try to
find out how they can communicate with this wild woman.
''Ideoglossic'' is the term for a language people develop between
themselves. Apted and Nicholson developed their own version -- Nellish
-- which Foster speaks in the film.
Nell differs from most wild children in that she speaks a language
which is based on English. With most wild children it is impossible to
communicate because their language was not based on any known language.
She has also had a loving, if isolated and secret upbringing and has not
been physically abused.
''I did not want to make a depressing film,'' he said. ''Equally I did
not want the story just all wrapped up sweetly. At the end you see her
looking at the little girl, the daughter of the doctor and the therapist
who helped her, and you see that sense of loss. She remembers her dead
twin.''

YOUR articles on asbestosis on successive days (March 3 and 4) reflect
the rising concern about the growing human costs of asbestos as more and
more people die from appalling asbestos-related disease.
Clydebank must be the asbestosis capital of Britain with an illness
rate 500 times the national average because of shipbuilding,
engineering, and the asbestos factory.
We are nowhere near a cure but we could stop the work of the appalling
Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU) of the Department of Social Security.
This claws back benefit paid to asbestosis sufferers if they win
compensation from the employers who poisoned them -- #1m has been clawed
back from asbestos sufferers already this year.
Consider that the victim has to prove he has the disease -- no easy
task. Then he has to prove where he got it perhaps 20 or 40 years ago.
Then, is the firm or its insurer still in existence?
Then there are all the revolting games of delay by lawyers and
insurers. The DSS then claws back any benefit paid out to a sufferer
since he found out he had the disease.
The highest sum the DSS has reclaimed from a victim this year (not an
asbestos sufferer) was #84,000. This is part of the #100m which the CRU
has got back from victims of accident, illness, and disease alone this
year.
What is the point of protesting about a low settlement? All extra
money won would go back to the Treasury because of the delay.
What is particularly revolting is that the Government takes your money
even if it has been awarded for ''pain and suffering'' rather than loss
of earnings.
This is nothing less than Government theft.
Over 200 MPs have signed my early day motion to get rid of the CRU. We
await the report of the Social Security Select Committee which has been
investigating the CRU.
I have now received over 140 letters from all over Britain from people
who have found National Insurance a fraud.
''Why did we pay our stamps all those years when the Government claws
back our benefit after calamity hits us?''
What private insurance company would be allowed to behave in such a
fraudulent way?

URGENT legislation is needed to cope with the moral and ethical
consequences of rapid advances in human genetics, Professor Sheila
McLean, of Glasgow University, told MPs yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Science and Technology Select Committee,
Professor McLean warned that gene research is raising questions about an
individual's right to medical privacy and access to insurance which are
not covered by existing legislation.
She called on the Government to appoint a Royal Commission which could
evolve into some sort of body that would oversee developments in
genetical science and guide resulting legislation.
''What we need is a Royal Commission which is acting transparently,
but with a specific remit to consider how the law might impact on these
subjects, from surrogacy arrangements to medical records,'' she said.
Mr Spencer Batiste, Tory MP for Elmet, said things were changing too
quickly. A commission would ''cement everything'' into place and look
''fairly silly'' after a short period of time.
Professor McLean said she did not want extremely directive
legislation. Instead, it should create a structure like a licencing body
with powers to police genetics, but also with sufficient built-in
discretion to allow it to adapt to unforeseen scientific advances.
She said the speed with which research into the human body's genetic
structure -- the international human genome project -- is advancing
makes setting up a legal framework a matter of urgency. ''We don't have
long.''
Professor McLean heads the Law School's medical law unit, which is
examining the legal, ethical and social implications of the human genome
project, the first law school to do so. It hopes to host an
international conference on genetics next March.

AS one of the Tory councillors on Stirling District Council and the
elected member for Bridge of Allan the comments of George Robertson, MP,
on gerrymandering took my breath away by their sheer hypocrisy (February
27).
It was the Labour Party which suggested to the Boundaries Commission
that the status quo recommended for Stirling should be reconsidered --
and wouldn't it be a good idea to move Bridge of Allan and the
accompanying ward into the Clackmannan parliamentary constituency?
It knows well that to remove Bridge of Allan from Michael Forsyth's
constituency would effectively wipe out his majority.
As for Mr Robertson's comment about betraying the Stirling voters on
tax, what does he mean? We reduced the council tax by 26% last year, and
improved services.
Mr Robertson should check the facts that are fed to him before making
public statements, although he does know the facts on local taxation. As
a resident in Stirling district, he is a beneficiary of the 26%
reduction.

Education and training have always been important but they are
arguably even more essential now given the changing nature of work and
trade liberalisation. Low-skilled uneducated people in northern Europe
increasingly face the prospect of long-term unemployment and poor living
standards as they cannot hope to compete with ''cheaper'' workers in the
emerging markets of the Far East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
The issue of Eastern European trade's likely impact on the developed
countries of Europe is an interesting one. Since the beginning of the
year there has effectively been a single market open to all East
European countries in all industries barring steel and textiles. So far
there does not appear to have been the cataclysmic effect on some
industries in the West that had been expected.
It is still relatively early days in terms of developing Eastern
Europe's trade with the nations of the European Union. However EU trade
with the East is growing strongly -- nearly doubling between 1985 and
1992 -- with the prospect of more to come. Aggregate trade flows with
the East have increased much faster than overall Community trade since
1985. Trade with Eastern nations now accounts for about 15% of non-OECD
trade in the European Community.
So far exported products from Eastern Europe have not been in direct
competition with some of our more sensitive industries such as
agriculture, cars, and steel, which have been afforded protection. The
Europe Agreements, for example, provide special treatment for the
perceived sensitive sectors, which account for as much as 40% of imports
from Eastern nations.
The largest increases in import penetration have been observed in
industries such as building materials, wood, and metal products and
mechanical engineering. For instance, imports of structural metal
products, boilers and reservoirs, cement and rolling stocks, have risen
more than sixfold between 1985-86 and 1991-92.
Research carried out by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)
suggests that among northern European countries Britain and Italy are
most vulnerable to cheaper imports from Eastern Europe. The areas of
Britain most exposed are said to be the Midlands and Northern Ireland
where there is already high unemployment. This is because East European
countries have a comparative advantage in the kinds of manufacturing
industries which predominate in these regions, namely motor cars,
glassware, steel, plastics, rubber, textiles, metal and wood
transformation, and printing.
Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece, and parts
of Italy have similarities with Eastern Europe in terms of their
comparative advantages in certain industries. However, at least in the
short term, southern European industries which use unskilled labour and
require little capital, such as clothing, furniture, and leather goods
are expected to continue to prosper.
Traditional heavy and light industries within the EU, particularly in
countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and the Benelux, that use
unskilled labour will come under growing pressure. As they become less
competitive, there will be a shift in these economies towards
organisations which receive their added value from the knowledge and the
creativity they put in rather than the muscle power.
We are already seeing this with the growth of the more obviously
knowledge-based business sectors of consultancy, finance and insurance,
advertising, journalism and publishing, television, healthcare,
education, and entertainment. This makes sense. The profitable future
for Western nations in the long term lies in specialising in
high-technology industries such as office equipment and electrical
appliances and those industries which rely heavily on human capital such
as pharmaceuticals and aerospace.
Thirty years ago nearly half of all workers in the industrialised
countries were making or helping to make things. In another 30 years'
time this figure may have dropped to 10%. It has already declined to 18%
in the US.
Although some forms of protectionism are likely to remain in
particular markets and particular regions, traditional industries in
northern Europe will not be able to compete in the long term unless they
specialise in particular value-added niche sectors of the market. This
has already been proven. For example, access to new technology has
improved productivity and made it economically viable to invest in
certain types of shipbuilding, textiles, and the manufacture of footwear
and ceramics in northern Europe, in the face of strong competition from
the Far East.
However, there could be potential social problems as the gap widens
between those with high incomes and highly prized skills and those
unskilled manual workers who are effectively priced out of the jobs
market. Some analysts forecast that the wages of unskilled labour could
fall by up to 7% compared with a rise of 10% for highly skilled people.
Even if this were to happen, the wages of unskilled workers in northern
Europe would still be 'way ahead of those available to similar workers
in the East. This could encourage some migration of labour from poorer
Eastern countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to more affluent Western
nations.
We have already seen a taste of the problems to come with the recent
French seamen's blockade of the Channel ports in protest at the use of
cheaper Polish crews. If similar unrest is to be avoided in other
sectors of industry then more investment will have to be made in
education, skills, and training to create better, more secure jobs. This
will help to offset the adverse effects of trade liberalisation which
overall should bring large economic benefits to the EU.

THE NHS was set up to care for people who were ill and needed
treatment or whose needs for care were such that other facilities like
homes could not cope with them.
It was not set up as a free substitute for residential care to enable
families to inherit their parents' money intact, and it does no favours
to an old person to put him/her into a ward where often enough the other
patients are too mentally and physically disabled to provide company.
During various spells working for the NHS I often came across people
who didn't need hospital care in medical wards where they occupied beds
needed by ill people; or in geriatric wards.
Some were awaiting places in local authority homes but others were
there so families could inherit their cash.
One man I remember had had a stroke and needed care, but not in
hospital. He had plenty of money and was more than willing to go to a
nursing home but his family always blocked the transfer arrangements.
The permanent staff were used to such situations -- his family wanted
his money. They had never looked after him themselves and would never
have had to. The man was mentally alert but lonely and miserable as the
other patients couldn't talk to him and the nurses were too busy.
The best of the residential homes, however, provide stimulation,
entertainment, and company for the residents. I have visited several,
and they are far more suited to alert old people's needs than a
hospital.
There is nothing new about having to pay for residential care -- it
has been this way since 1948, I believe. The poor pay nothing.
There is no ''right'' to inherit money. If someone does, it is good
fortune -- after all, millions inherit nothing.

IN your report on Church of Scotland chaplaincies in universities and
elsewhere you state that universities currently meet only 50% of the
costs (March 1).
I do not know what happens in other universities but the University of
Glasgow receives no help from the church in this matter. The university
considers that the work of chaplaincy is vital and therefore finances it
entirely.
In addition, the university contributes to the cost of the chaplain to
overseas students and provides her with working accommodation and other
facilities.

YOUR editorial presented a balanced view of the issues in the Ayr
child sexual abuse case (February 28), while other papers were
vindicating parents, pillorying social workers, when, in fact, we are
still in doubt about the truth.
Again a senior court has overturned verdicts of more junior courts
almost five years later. Where are children in this situation when the
responsible adults have to use a system which can interpret the truth as
they see it?
You say the evidence has not changed. What does this system say to
children who have given their accounts of what happened to them to
sheriffs, panel members, and professionals? Do children have a voice or
does the legal system take precedence?
Social work training has focused on the complexity of the task of
hearing the child. The Clyde Report drew attention to the fact that
interviewing children is not a prescribed process of question and
answer. It is about establishing trust between adults and children over
a period of time.
What the law looks for is clarity, consistency, and corroboration --
the very things a child is going to find difficult.
Social workers work within a legal framework and act on decisions made
by courts. They are only too aware of the issues and are often left with
feelings of distress that children are left in vulnerable situations
because the weight of evidence required by the current system is well
beyond reasonable doubt.

YOUR coverage of the Ayrshire sexual abuse case was in general
balanced, in particular the concluding point in the leader, ''Doubt is a
frequent fellow traveller in the search for the truth about sexual
abuse'' was a wise and salutary one (February 28).
However, by way of contrast, Michael Fry's comments (March 1) were
both uninformed and unhelpful. He refers to the ''bungling of individual
social workers'', omitting to mention the scrutinising and
substantiating of the evidence of abuse, in 1992, by professions other
than social work.
While Sheriff Miller refers to the case as ''complex, complicated, and
disturbing'', Michael Fry reduces it to simple social work ''bungling''.
Secondly, his assertion that ''social work does not rest on theory''
is palpably untrue. Social work has an impressive and expanding
knowledge base, so much so that the profession has consistently argued
for a longer professional training period to do greater justice to the
range of social work theories available.
Current social work thinking emphasises the importance of minimum
necessary intervention, looks critically at US originating theory, and
is not utopianistic in believing social problems can be ''cured''.
Michael Fry's contribution adds nothing to the wider understanding of
so sensitive a subject as child sexual abuse but instead fuels existing
misconceptions and prejudices.

I DO so agree with E Keating's modest proposal that teachers should be
banned from driving in order to free the roads of congestion during term
time (March 3). However, this does not go far enough as it takes no
account of the serious problems created elsewhere by these self same
teachers after the end of term.
It is well known that they enjoy long holidays on the Continent in the
summer, thus causing unacceptable congestion at air and sea ports
throughout the high season. It would therefore be a prudent move to
withdraw not only their driving licences but their passports as well, so
that they would not be able to go gallivanting abroad.
Not only would this measure ensure that normal people could travel
with ease on their own well-deserved holidays, but into the bargain
teachers would then be forced to spend their large salaries here in the
UK supporting the British economy instead of bringing it down as they
have been doing for far too long.
Naturally teachers could, as duty required, be issued with special
documents to enable them to travel abroad with pupils on officially
sanctioned trips. These special passports would of course be able to
restrict their access to beaches, cafes, discos, pavements, etc, and
include perhaps some form of curfew arrangement so that their presence
would cause the absolute minimum of inconvenience to real people with
families.
Teaching is a vocation, not a vacation -- and it's about time these
so-called teachers started living in the real world.

I NOTE that the cable company at present excavating in Bearsden has
begun an expensive advertising campaign in this newspaper. What a relief
to know that what we are seeing is just a ''rapid installation
programme'' with ''a certain amount of digging and pavement work''.
We poor beleaguered citizens of Bearsden think it's the Third World
War. Maybe they will be back to finish the road resurfacing in the
spring.
Such a pity, too, about the cabinet -- so large, so ugly, so many,
just like the gas board, the SSEB, and BT used to have. A case of ''Back
to the Future'' perhaps. And, as the ads proudly proclaim, ''No
unsightly satellite dishes or aerials'' -- just lots of unsightly
cabinets instead.
At least those people who opt for Sky TV have the choice, a freedom
denied to those like me with cabinets on their doorsteps, installed
without consultation, without consent, without apology. Free-standing
too; so much for the claims of ''sensitive'' siting.
The information superhighway may indeed be wonderful, but does it
really require arrogant, patronising bully-boy tactics to enforce it on
the unsuspecting public? And I haven't even mentioned the tree roots or
the environment yet. As consumers we have the ultimate choice, and every
day brings better and cheaper alternatives. So, yes, tel your friends,
tel everyone, tel them NO.

IN 1925 Britain was behind other industrial countries in the use of
electricity: the whole system was in need of standardisation, there were
too many small and inefficient generators, and many small towns had no
electricity supply.
The Weir Committee recommended that generation be concentrated in
large efficient power stations, and that the country should be covered
by a ''grid-iron'' of high-voltage transmission lines.
That was sensible in 1925. But what was sensible in 1925 is not
necessarily sensible now.
It is no longer true that large power stations are the most efficient.
It is not possible to turn the energy in a fuel into mechanical or
electrical power with 100% efficiency: this is against the laws of
physics. In a conventional power station between one-quarter and a half
of the energy in the fuel is turned into electrical power, and the rest
heats up the cooling water. At Longannet, for example, nearly two-thirds
of the energy in the fuel is wasted in heating up the Firth of Forth.
If this heat could be used for a central heating plant, there is no
theoretical reason why a power station should not be 100% efficient.
Such a unit, providing both heat and power, is called a Combined Heat
and Power (CHP) plant. Since, unlike electricity, heat cannot be
transmitted over long distances, CHP plants must be built where the heat
is needed. They produce more heat than power, and are most efficient if
they are operated as central heating units that produce electricity as a
valuable by-product.
One of the reasons put forward for linking Northern Ireland to the
Scottish grid is that Northern Ireland is over-dependent on oil for
generating electricity. Coal reserves are many times larger than oil
reserves, and any fossil fuelled power station that is expected to last
more than 30 years must be coal fired.
Up to now coal-fired power stations have been like Longannet: a bit
messy, inefficient, and usually very large. But some years ago the
Swedes, like the Northern Irish, were worried about their
over-dependence on oil. They built a coal-fired power station of a new
type in the middle of Stockholm. It is on the quayside: the fuel is
conveyed from the ship to the covered storage area by enclosed
conveyors, so that there is no dust.
It burns the coal in a way that traps the sulphur (the chief cause of
acid rain) in the ash. The ash conveyors are also enclosed and the ash
itself, instead of being an environmental nuisance, can be used to make
paving blocks or hardcore for building, so that it is a valuable
by-product.
This station has been in service since 1991. Since it is connected to
Stockholm's district heating system it functions as a CHP plant and is
therefore at least twice as efficient as any coal-fired unit in the UK.
The most progressive cities in Europe all have district heating
schemes. Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, and Vienna all have them. There
are over 50,000 miles of pipes distributing hot water or steam around
the cities of Europe: they are increasingly coming to be heated by CHP
plants.
The city of Brescia, in Northern Italy, generates so much power in its
municipal heating plants that in winter it has a surplus to sell to the
Italian grid, earning revenue for the benefit of the local taxpayers.
The heat for a district heating scheme can be provided by any
convenient fuel. In continental cities municipal rubbish is often used.
As the technique of coppicing is developed, wood chips will undoubtedly
be used more and more (growing coppice wood is a better use of land than
set-aside, it provides employment and income for farmers, and the
coppices are havens for wildlife).
These CHP schemes are to be found mostly in cities where the elected
local authority has the duty, or at least the power, to provide the
citizens with a full range of public services.
A power station that throws away two-thirds of the energy in its fuel
may well be the cheapest way of providing electrical power if
electricity is considered in isolation. But if a town council is
responsible for providing heat, light, and power, a CHP plant is likely
to be the most economical way of doing so because heat that would be
wasted in a conventional power station can be sold very cheaply,
reducing the consumer's total fuel bills.
The structure of local government in Northern Ireland is one of the
things that will have to be settled over the coming months. This is an
opportunity to give the councils the power to provide really efficient
services.
The British Government is committed to reducing carbon dioxide
emissions, and the best way of doing this without reducing the services
provided is by improving efficiency: the use of CHP can double the
efficiency with which fuel is used. Small CHP plants are being used more
and more, but fuels other than gas are most conveniently used in
district heating schemes and the structure of local government in this
country has, up to now, inhibited their use.
The future lies with local energy conversion to serve local needs. The
EU has promised #240m for refurbishing the city centres of Belfast and
Londonderry: there will never be a better opportunity to give these
cities modern district heating schemes, to put them on a par with
Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, and Vienna. If this opportunity is taken,
Northern Ireland could set an example that could begin the process of
dragging the British electricity supply system into the second half of
the twentieth century. Connecting Northern Ireland to Scotland, so that
power can be generated at Longannet for use in Belfast, would simply
fossilise a system that made sense in the 1920s but makes no sense now.

A study in Finland reported in the current issue of Monitor Weekly,
found that a recent high intake of alcohol was a significant factor in
stroke victims. The evidence is more convincing since the group studied
(people under 40) are not particularly liable to strokes. But all
patients in the study had taken more than five units of alcohol during
the 24 hours prior to falling ill.

NICHOLAS POWELL reports from Paris on research that could help
everyone feel better -- except the drug companies
THIS may be no elixir of eternal life, but it is a genuine feel-good
factor. A naturally-occurring molecule with an impossibly complex name,
isolated 30 years ago but only experimented on recently, is being hailed
in the US and France as a potent agent in the fight against aging.
DHEA in its abbreviated form, Dehydroepindrosterone Sulphate to be
scientifically correct, will not make anyone live longer. It will not
smooth out wrinkles, or combat serious diseases such as Alzheimer's,
sclerosis, Parkinson's or rheumatoid arthritis. But leading scientists
have great hopes that DHEA will spur the body on to fight troublesome
effects of ageing, and help combat afflictions as diverse as rheumatic
pain, memory loss, certain forms of cancer linked with the agieng
process, and cardiac illness.
It could help stave off the onset of AIDS, as the level of DHEA in the
bloodstream is known to decrease in HIV-positive patients when they
begin to develop symptoms. DHEA should improve general feelings of
psychological and physical well-being. Our deaths will remain largely
genetically programmed, and turn up to their appointments. But getting
there should be less of a bore. The human and economic implications are
enormous.
And the molecule DHEA is secreted by the adrenal glands which sit atop
the kidneys. It flows around the bloodstream in huge quantities for such
a substance (between 10 and 100 times as much as other steroids) and has
an impressively long shelf life -- DHEA ''lives'' for ten hours in the
system.
A neurosteroid, which acts on the nervous and immune systems, DHEA
also contributes to our growth. It appears in our bodies around the age
of seven and peaks in quantity around the age of 25, after which the
future is just one long decline -- by the age of 70 we have only about
10% of the DHEA we had as lads and lassies. What complicates matters
considerably is that the amount of DHEA going the rounds varies
considerably from one individual to another. And the amount drops even
lower with age in people who have had less to start off with.
DHEA has been complicated to research because it is peculiar to man
and some of our big ape cousins, who have less of it. It is not found in
the sort of animals usually tested in laboratories, although one
laboratory rat, to confuse matters, had some in its brain -- so it can
be located in animals' nervous systems. Nevertheless, laboratory tests
using huge doses of DHEA on animals like rats cured them of numerous
diseases and even prevented cancer in one species predisposed to the
illness.
French professor Emile-Etienne Baulieu, inventor of the morning-after
contraceptive pill for women, RU 486, and holder of the prestigious US
Lasker Prize for Medical Research, first spotted DHEA in the early
1960s. But as it is cheap to synthesise and as a natural product, it
can't be patented, and because it may help reduce medicine consumption
by elderly people, drug companies have not been forthcoming to help
research it.
But what does DHEA do? The endocrine glands use it to produce male and
female hormones. More generally, it keeps us fit and our inequality in
the face of the diseases that beset old age can be linked, Prof Baulieu
and his colleagues think, to the inequal distribution of DHEA among
individuals.
An old friend of Prof Baulieu, Samuel Yen, who is Professor of
Medicine of Reproduction at San Diego University, California, has just
concluded a preliminary six-month trial on men and women aged between 71
and 94. The product, compared to a placebo, was taken orally in small
doses. Eliminated effortlessly, it had no side-effects and produced an
improvement in the physical and psychological well-being of a
significant number of patients -- 82% of the women and 67% of the men.
Patients reported enjoying better sleep, feeling of greater energy and
an improved reaction to normally stressful situations. Sex drive was not
affected but a few said pains and stiffness in their joints had
improved.
When will they be sure it can do more? Prof Baulieu says that while
certain characteristics of DHEA still need to be described, he is
convinced that the substance in small doses will produce no
side-effects. The next step in research will be a comprehensive trial,
due to begin soon in three Paris hospitals. Stocks of serum dating back
a number of years (DHEA remains stable in such conditions), will be used
to determine how levels vary from one individual to another, especially
as they age, and how its level in the bloodstream ties in with histories
of illness.
Professors Baulieu and Yen hope that DHEA will have revealed all its
secrets within the next three or four years. If its promises come true,
the molecule should be a huge money-saver for national health services.
People over the age of 60, in France at least, require twice as much
medical attention and consume two and a half times as much medicine as
the national average. The difficulty could be getting drug companies to
co-operate. For however much there is to be said of the value of DHEA,
precious little money apparently stands to be made from it.

Actress Dorothy Paul has thrown her heart and soul into our women's
health campaign. Ann Shaw explains her role -- and how you can help
ONE OF Glasgow's best-loved actresses, Dorothy Paul, has a new role to
play -- and it is one that will be rembered for years to come. For
Dorothy is to launch our Coffee Break, an innovative fund-raising
venture for The Herald's Campaign for Women's Health.
So, please join Dorothy at the Glasgow Moat House International at
10.30am on March 27 to find out how you can help raise money for our
One-Stop gynaecological clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Already funds
stand at more than #26,000. We expect to open the clinic early this
summer, but we need your help.
Just back from hillwalking in New Zealand, Dorothy welcomes the
opportunity to launch our inititiative. ''So often women put their own
health last. Let's hope that this new clinic at the Royal Infirmary will
become a prototype for others throughout Scotland.''
Now in her mid-fifties, she knows all about the problems women can
have in middle life. She is a firm advocate of Hormone Replacement
Therapy. ''Without it I could not do my job. I tried coming off for a
few months and it was a disaster. I've been on it for seven years.''
She is enjoying increasing fame and fortune -- and she is bouncing
with energy and good looks. So what's her secret? Quite simple. She puts
it down to exercise, Evening Primose oil and HRT.
With two marriages behind her and a long spell as a single parent of
hertwo daughters, now grown up, life has not always been easy. Born in
Dennistoun, the daughter of an electrician and a musical mother, Dorothy
learned to play the piano and sing from an early age.
She entered showbusiness as an 18-year-old at the Tivoli in Aberdeen,
but first came to fame on STV's One O'Clock Gang.She has a special place
in the affections of many Glaswegians through her highly successful
one-woman show, See That's Her, based on her early life in Dennistoun.
She has a personality that has been described as electrifying, warm
and honest without being intimidating, pushy or patronising. In other
words a very likeable Glaswegian, true to her roots.So, we are delighted
Dorothy has agreed to host our first fund-raising Coffee Break.
After Dorothy has got things off to a rousing start, our Marketing
Department will reveal the mechanics of our novel fund-raising venture,
something you can do in your own home.
We believe this is the first time it has been tried in Scotland;
elsewhere reports have been rapturous. Like all good fund-raising
ventures, it is enjoyable first and foremost. So what is it? I am not
allowed to reveal it at this stage . . . but let's say we are looking
for 400 Coffee Break hostesses.
Come along and listen. You don't have to join, though of course we
hope you will. To get your complimentary ticket simply fill in the

* ANN SIMPSON writes: Women are so pivotal to the well-being of our
society that the quality of their own health is vital to us all. In
Scotland the statistics are not good. A recent 10-year international
study, the Monica Project, examined heart disease in 22 countries and
found that women in the north of Glasgow fared worst among a sample of
15 million people. Meanwhile the latest available figures for lung
cancer show women's mortality from the disease is higher here than
elsewhere in the world, and has, in fact, doubled in the past 20 years.
Breast cancer also continues to rise, killing seven women a day. Cancer
of the cervix accounts for about 180 deaths a year year and the annual
fatality rate for ovarian cancer is around 377 women; for cancer of the
uterus, 107 women.
What can be done? Preventative vigilence is the obvious strategy and
one already operating to some extent through networks like Well Women
clinics and the various national screening programmes. But there remains
a pressing need to increase consciousness throughout our culture about
the importance of women's health and the urgency of providing the best
possible speedy treatment and care when problems do arise.
To this end we have launched The Herald Foundation for Women's Health,
a charity whose first project is the establishment of a ''one-stop''
gynaecological clinc for women with menstrual and related disorers.
Based at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, the service will be
consultant-led and staffed by a dedicated team with access to the latest
technology for investigation, diagnosis and treatment, and the ability
to exclude malignant disease as a causal factor. It will operate in an
environment of personal and friendly care and the aim is to open it by
the summer. Women will be referred to it by their general practitioners
and although the majority of patients will be from the Glasgow area,
patients from other parts of the country will not be discouraged.
The cost of setting up and running the clinic requires #100,000, and
in the few months since the charity began our readers have generously
raised just over #26,000 either through individual or community
donations. Ceilidhs have been held along with church fetes and fun-runs,
and various women's groups, like the Soroptimists, have pledged support.
In one instance employers have agreed to match any sum raised for the
clinic by the women on their staff. In another, contributions have come
via company dances and public dinners. The Christmas stamps project,
organised in conjunction with the Royaly Mail, brought in #2,000. Now,
with the Big Coffee Break, we are entering the second phase of our
collecting and it this kind of collective effort which is so vital and
valuable to the Foundation's work.
Women help to make the economy go round, and when illness deals them a
serious blow the world of the family often collapses. So, as much as
this venture is about women's welfare it is about Scotland's state of
health, too. And this is why we also need the support of industry,
commerce and the professions; in fact any business where women are
integral to the workforce. Every single one of us needs to try and avert
the anguish behind the statistics.

E KEATING implies that teaching is not a real job (March 3).
Such a statement is one of profound ignorance. It most certainly is a
real job dealing with youngsters in the classroom on a daily basis with
its attendant stresses and strains.
E Keating's further absurd notion that teachers should be banned from
driving on a permanent basis is one of the most bizarre remarks which I
have ever read.

A FORMER policeman who quit the force because of disabling back
injuries, was hurt during ''restraint and arrest'' training, the High
Court in London was told yesterday.
Mr Malcolm Bradley, 35, now of Albury, Drynie Park North, near Muir of
Ord, Ross-shire, a probationary constable in the London force when the
injury occurred on January 17, 1989, is fighting for compensation from
the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who denies blame.
His counsel, Mr Neil Garnham, said he had been paired off with another
constable, posing as a suspect, during restraint and arrest training at
Peckham Police Station, south London.
The manoeuvre being practised was known as ''press down'', and
involved Mr Bradley manhandling his colleague to the ground before
applying a wrist lock, Mr Justice Waterhouse was told.
During the exercise, Mr Bradley suffered excruciating back pain and
fell to the ground. His instructor's attempts to help him merely
redoubled his pain and probably made his back injuries more severe, Mr
Garnham said.
Mr Bradley made a ''substantial recovery'' before returning to police
duties three weeks later, but his back remained vulnerable and even
trivial manoeuvres continued to cause him pain.
He strained his back again while lifting one of his children in May
1989, and yet again in January 1990, when bending over to search a
suspect's car, this time putting an end to his police career.
Mr Bradley was retired from the force on medical grounds on January
17, 1991. He spent two years out of work before moving to the North of
Scotland, and now works as a fork-lift truck salesman, earning
#13,000-a-year, substantially less than had he been able to remain in
the force.
Mr Garnham said he still suffered severe back pain and disability, and
his back was likely to remain vulnerable for life.
The hearing continues.

EVIDENCE that the economy is beginning to respond to earlier interest
rate hikes designed to slow it down come at a difficult time for the
Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England who met yesterday.
Growth is still taking place but the pace of expansion is slowing. By
that test money is dear enough already and its cost would normally be
left. There might even be room for considering the possibility of lower
interest rates later this year. At this stage in previous expansionist
cycles the need to protect sterling has imposed higher interest rates
and the famous ''stop'' of the ''stop-go'' experience, which signalled
the inability of the economy to expand without overheating. What the
markets are suffering is not, however, anything like an old sterling
crisis. Sterling is really being dragged down by other currency
movements. The dollar, to which we remain coupled, no matter how
informally, has been moving sharply downwards, while the mark is moving
up.
At the heart of the dollar's longer-term weakness is the huge
borrowings of the United States -- and the inability of American
politicians to address it by raising taxes as Messrs Lamont and Clarke
did here. The unpopularity of these British moves (notwithstanding their
inherent prudence) has not escaped American politicians and both the
President and his opponents are dallying with the possibility of lower
taxation. That seems perverse: although the American economy is itself
growing with surprising vigour it can hardly hope to wipe out its
budgetary deficit entirely by enhanced revenues from growth. That
problem is compounded by a shorter-term difficulty: foreign investors
suspect that US interest rates have temporarily peaked at a time when
the currency needs the support of even higher rates. The American
monetary authorities do not want an ever-weakening dollar but they are
presented with the same challenge as the UK, whether to reduce growth by
dearer money which would stabilise the dollar, or let the dollar slip
further.
In our case the on-going recovery should be allowed to proceed. German
hints of reducing their own rates should be given a little more time to
work, along with the modest rises other EU members have just imposed.
Today is the traditional day for changes in UK rates, and the Governor
of the Bank of England has seemed to be wedded to dearer money, so he
may have persuaded the Chancellor to act again. UK stock markets did not
seem to think that likely. They could be wrong, but the Chancellor must
be beginning to hear the cries from the back benches -- and even from
Cabinet colleagues. There are new taxes still to come into operation
next month and the Government is only two years away from the next
election. Self-interest, self-preservation, will make pleas for some
relaxation beguiling, especially when they are not contradicted by
public interest. In an age of contained inflation cheap money should
generate growth. The cost of borrowing is too dear, a fact of great
importance for new investment. Every Chancellor since 1945 has found
continuing growth elusive. We are now getting it, even if the benefits,
which are in the export industries, remain obscure to millions of
taxpayers.

THE TORY Minister who resigned on Monday ''for family reasons'' after
admitting an affair yesterday called on the media to leave his wife and
children alone, following reports that his wife had played a part in the
break up of his previous marriage.
Mr Robert Hughes, MP for Harrow West, held a news conference on the
doorstep of his west London home. He told journalists his family should
be allowed to get on with their lives.
His wife, Sandra, pledged to support him after he resigned
unexpectedly as junior Public Service Minister, saying he needed time to
mend his marriage.
His departure embarrassed Mr Major, who withheld publication of the
traditional exchange of letters.
Yesterday Mr Hughes told journalists: ''On Monday, I told you all
candidly and honestly why I had to resign as a Minister. Now, whatever
you wish to say about me, that's up to you, and I make no complaint. I'm
fair game for that.
''But the fact is that my wife and three children are entirely
innocent parties in all of this, and two things have arisen since Monday
that makes it necessary for me to make yet another statement.
''Attempts have been made to trace my children by sick people who are
apparently journalists. That is not acceptable. Some newspapers have
been given lies about my wife. I wish to set the record entirely
straight.
''Sandra and I started to go out after I was separated amicably from
my first wife, so Sandra had absolutely nothing to do with the breakdown
of my first marriage.''
He refused to answer questions.

LEGISLATION to protect liberal states from the malign activities of
terrorists is difficult to frame and enforce for the obvious reason that
it tends to compromise the very things it aims to protect. It is easy to
see, therefore, why proponents and opponents of this country's
Prevention of Terrorism Act can argue their case with conviction. Labour
introduced the legislation the Conservatives have maintained; but Labour
has tended to react against the way in which its Act has operated in
practice -- more than two-thirds of those arrested under its provisions
have turned out to be innocent. Now that the attempts to produce peace
in Northern Ireland seem to be bearing fruit many believe that the case
for the Act is much weakened while its drawbacks are more than ever
exposed.
It is in the nature of terrorism and its containment that some wholly
innocent people should have their rights of free movement curtailed and
that they even suffer temporary arrest. The contemporary terrorist -- as
many incidents involving the IRA will in an instant confirm -- is able
to appear completely innocent of anything. In a free society he, or she,
is able to come and go with remarkably little surveillance or restraint.
A system which is successful in about one of every three occasions in
which suspects are arrested is neither onerous nor inadequate. Most
people will think that compared with the atrocities perpetrated by the
IRA, and they should not be forgotten, the infringement of civil
liberties attendant on preventing terrorism is not too high a price to
pay. It would be better if it did not have to be paid at all, but it can
scarcely be avoided in the modern world. The Act should be kept in
operation.
It is not just the Irish dimension which supports that conclusion,
though the fact that the IRA cannot unilaterally abandon its weaponry is
a reminder that it does not yet really trust or respect the essence of
democratic politics -- its peaceful nature, and acceptance of its
outcomes whatever these happen to be. That may change with time, with
Sinn Fein becoming a normal party, but it cannot be guaranteed. Quite
apart from that, however, is the way in which this country is the focus
of other terrrorist activities, particularly those emanating from the
Middle East. Some of these activities are inspired by memories of
Britain's Imperial role but some terrorists seek to use our territory to
get at enemies among refugees resident here, or at Jewish diplomats
working here. We all need protecting, but within the limits laid down by
Parliament. These limits are specified in the Act. From time to time
they may require amendment, but they do not seem likely to be abolished
completely.

DONALD Dewar receives a call from the BBC television drama department
at Pebble Mill in Birmingham. No, they don't want the MP for Glasgow
Garscadden to play Heathcliffe in a remake of Wuthering Heights,
although we believe he could make a pretty good stab at it.
They are making a play in which a police inspector enters a room and
says the line: ''Switch off that TV. What's that boring nonsense you
were watching anyway?''
No, Donald is not to play the polisman, although he has the height for
it. Donald's role is to be the face on the TV. For the boring bit on TV
the Pebble Mill producers wanted to use Donald talking about devolution
on the Kilroy show. Was that all right?
Donald, ever the gentleman, agreed.
Test of a true

WITH a capacity of only 3200, tickets for Stenhousemuir's Tennents
Scottish Cup tie on Saturday are in short supply. Graeme Hoggen from
Lenzie, a fan of long-standing at Ochilview, was more than a little
upset when he phoned the club to find that all the tickets had been
sold.
He told the club secretary that as one of the 300 or so regular
attenders of less glamorous matches surely he should get some
preferential treatment.
''OK,'' said the Stenhousemuir official, ''If you're a genuine fan,
name the team.''
''Harkness, Clarke, Donaldson, Armstrong, McGeachie, Christie, Steel,
Fisher, Mathieson, Hutchinson, Sprott. Substitutes: Roseburgh . . .''
He got his tickets.
Digit out, BT
BRITISH Telecom have been harping on about Phoneday when we all have
to insert an extra 1 into our telephone codes. ''Your number's up! Use
your new code now'' is the message which has been appearing on phone
bills. Not leading by example, BT lists its own number in Glasgow
without the extra digit.
That sinking
feeling
DEMOCRACY is alive and well in councils up and down Scotland. Take,
for instance, the following great debate at Cumbrae Community Council,
as reported in the Largs &amp; Millport Weekly News.
The topic under discussion was vandalism of the public conveniences in
Millport.
Community council member Mary Currie asked: ''Where are the police
when they know that is a bad area? If the police made themselves shown
at the toilets on a regular basis there might not be the same
problems.''
Regional councillor Fergus Clarkson replied: ''Everyone wants
policemen everywhere, but these guys are pretty expensive and I don't
know if you would be making the best use of the police by having them
guarding your toilets. There are cheaper ways of doing it, like
surveillance cameras.''
Footnote -- The front page of the same edition of the newspapers
carried a late-breaking story: ''Police divers spent all Friday
searching for a security camera which had been stolen after being
secretly hidden in the toilets at Millport Pier . . .''
* MORE democracy in action, this time from the Western Isles Council
debating chamber in Stornoway. Councillor Donald Maclean, the relatively
new member for Lochmaddy, declared that he did not understand a report
to the finance committee. Despite attempted explanations by the chief
executive and the director of finance, Councillor Maclean, a retired
police superintendent, declared himself ''still confused''.
Some longer-serving council members told Mr Maclean not to worry and
that he would soon pick things up. Mr Maclean stood his ground: ''I
accept what the director of finance has said but I am still confused.
However, I reserve the right to be confused. That is my right and it is
my intention every time I am confused to not keep quiet.
''And no-one on this council will make me keep quiet -- whatever their
title -- when I am confused.''
And it wasn't even in the Gaelic.
That's my boy!
LESLEY Riddoch, editor of the Scotswoman newspaper, was on the BBC
Breakfast programme yesterday morning being strident, as she does so
well, about International Women's Day.
She chose the wrong person with whom to be strident, Sir Bernard
Ingham, the doughty former media adviser to Mrs Thatcher, who was on the
programme to review the daily papers. ''Do you have any children and if
so, who's looking after them right now?'' she asked.
''Yes. One. Himself. He's 38,'' replied Sir Bernard.
* UNLIKE some newspapers, we don't have to change our name as a token
gesture for International Women's Day. We have always been The Herald.
To mark the occasion, however, all the lads on The Herald were yesterday
wearing ladies' underwear. For many of us it was a new and interesting
experience.

Alf Young, Economics Editor, explains why the currency crisis means we
are
all in for a roller-coaster ride
HOLD on to your seats for another global currency crisis. The words
and images used to portray the latest gyrations in the relative values
of the dollar, mark, yen and pound in markets round the world owe
something to the thrill of the fairground ride.
And don't those graphs of the dollar plunging against the yen, or the
pound testing new lows against the mark, bear an uncanny resemblance to
the big dipper? Frantic dealers trying to keep on top of the market's
switchback momentum -- and make a profitable turn in the process -- add
further dramatic colour to the scene.
Yet outwith bank treasury dealing rooms, away from the specialist wire
services and computer screens, for those of us not privy to what
transpires at meetings between Ken and Eddie, the Chancellor and the
Bank of England governor, does all the fuss have any meaning or impact
on our lives? Or is it a shadow show only slightly less esoteric,
marginally more intelligible than the kind of derivatives trading
indulged in by Nick Leeson in Singapore?
Well, yes, it does matter. At the level of the obvious, it matters
every time we go abroad and have to convert to another currency. Last
week in New York I was doing the kind of mental arithmetic indulged in
by travellers everywhere. The price of clothes, CDs, even a pastrami
sandwich at Carnegie's Deli on Fifth Avenue looked that little bit more
inviting as the pound climbed into the 1.60-plus range against the
weakening dollar.
It is obvious, too, that one line of defence against a crumbling
currency is a hike in domestic interest rates. Since Monday, five member
states of the European Union have pushed up short-term rates in a bid to
ride out the turbulence. That means dearer borrowing at home, though
thankfully not yet here in the UK. That too is something everyone
understands.
Contrary to Harold Wilson's dictum, devaluation, whether within a
quasi-fixed rate mechanism like the ERM or through the downward movement
of a floating currency, really can hit the pound in your pocket.
But the constant ordering and reordering of currencies against each
other is also saying something significant, at a deeper level, about the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the economies concerned. For most
of the time, the massive round-the-clock global trading in and out of
this currency or that, is spurred by movements in the second, third or
fourth decimal point.
That's what passes for stability in a world where fixed exchange rates
are, largely, a thing of the past. Only currency traders and the
institutions or speculators who employ them get excited by the profit to
be made by correctly guessing what such fractional movements will be
later today, tomorrow or next week.
But when the pound gyrates by four or five German pfennigs in the
space of a few hours or the dollar loses five per cent of its value
against both the yen and the mark in the space of a week, stability
gives way to crisis. Central banks intervene to buy up threatened
currencies in an attempt to shore up their value.
Central bankers and finance ministers, choosing their words as
carefully as they would pick their way through a minefield, try to
restore calm. Thus yesterday in Washington the Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan was telling a house committee that the recent fall in the
dollar was unwelcome, troublesome and very likely overdone.
But he was also making it plain that he favours action on the US's
yawning budget deficit, despite last week's one-vote rejection of the
Republican amendment to balance the budget by 2002. Greenspan knows that
the amendment's failure was not well received in the world's currency
markets and is a crucial factor in the dollar's current weakness.
In Frankfurt, the mighty Bundesbank was letting it be known that the
current turbulence is not justified by economic fundamentals. In Rome,
the new Italian Prime Minister was quoting the German finance minister
Theo Waigel -- in turn, apparently, quoting the Bundesbank president
Hans Tietmeyer -- to the effect that there would be no early rise in
German interest rates and that Germany has no interest in seeing the
mark appreciate any further.
To suggest, as popular accounts generally do, that any currency crisis
consists of a flight from currencies perceived as weak into those seen
as safe havens only scratches the surface of the complex dynamics at
work.
The volume of money traded daily on the international currency markets
now swamps the slender resources of central banks. Currency markets,
whether acting on rumour, instinct or a concerted determination to test
the resolve of national institutions to resist them, can and do rule the
roost. Governments can preach calm, but they no longer have it in their
power to deliver order.
The dynamics of the current crisis are intriguing. The currencies in
favour are the mark and the yen, yet Germany and Japan both still face
daunting domestic reconstruction programmes, thanks to reunification on
the one hand and the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake on the other.
And both economies are perceived as favouring employment strategies --
determined adherence to the social chapter provisions of the Maastricht
Treaty in the case of Bonn; a lingering, if threatened, commitment to
cradle-to-grave employer paternalism in the case of Tokyo -- which
undermine competitiveness in global terms.
So why are these the safe havens in the current crisis? Why, if the UK
is now one of the strongest economies in Europe, according to Mr Major
and his ministers, is the pound testing all-time lows against the mark?
Yes, the dynamics of global currency markets can seem deeply perplexing.
One other aspect of the current crisis is worth noting. With two
devaluations and five interest rate rises in a week, the member
currencies of the wide-band ERM, apart from the mark, are having a very
rough time.
The crisis raises yet again the question of whether such a half-way
house between a common European currency and a return to freely floating
national currencies can long survive. If it doesn't, will the drive
towards a common currency be accelerated? And where will that leave
sterling on future roller coaster rides?

TWO of Scotland's leading left- wing MPs surprised colleagues
yesterday by appearing to back Labour leader Tony Blair over his Clause
4 reforms.
On the eve of the Scottish Labour Party conference in Inverness this
weekend, Mr Michael Connarty (Falkirk East) and Mr Malcolm Chisholm
(Edinburgh Leith), both of whom could have been thought to be
hard-liners, threw their weight behind the Labour leader.
The springboard for their remarks was a Westminster meeting of the
Parliamentary Labour Party, at which the vital Clause 4 reforms formed a
key part of the discussion.
The meeting was addressed by Mr Blair before debate was opened up to
test party feeling.
Mr Connarty denied he had changed his line but acknowledged that his
comments may have raised eyebrows.
He said afterwards: ''I am a member of the Campaign for Socialism in
Scotland. People have said this is a kind of 'Save Clause 4' campaign,
but it is not. It says that necessary additions can be put on to Clause
4 and is trying to ensure that the principles of Clause 4 are
maintained.
''I believe the principles will be retained and the argument that if
we put our values first we will win is correct. We are a collective
political force, there to create opportunities and policies to resist
the Government on behalf of the people. We are there to prevent
exploitation and alienation.
Mr Chisholm refused to comment on his remarks to the PLP, at what he
said had been ''a private meeting.'' However Labour sources indicated
that they felt his remarks had been significant.
One said: ''He made clear that what was more important was our
commitment to certain policy areas -- not just what our values were but
what we were actually going to do.
''He did not think Clause 4 was worth fighting for as a form of words.
What was important was giving people the right to employment and a fair
share of the economic cake.''

LABOUR yesterday urged Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to give specific
guarantees on the future of Scotland's sleeper and motorail services.
The party's demands follow weeks of confusion over the consultative
procedures being adopted by British Rail, which plans to reduce the
services at the end of May.
At the same time, the rail franchising director, Mr Roger Salmon, is
due to set the minimum passenger service requirement for the ScotRail
franchise, but his decisions will not take effect until later this year.
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish said yesterday that
Mr Lang and Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney should stop ''hiding
behind the coat-tails'' of rail officials, and take immediate action to
safeguard the services until proper consultation could take place.
He said the Ministers should insist that BR takes bookings for travel
after May; continues the sleeper and motorail services to Fort William
until at least October; and guarantees that no services would be
withdrawn until all consultations are over.
Mr McLeish concluded: ''The Government's rail privatisation plans are
a disaster for Scotland's tourism economy.
''Arguments about the cost of the services are beyond belief from a
Government that has squandered more than #750m so far on privatisation,
and proposes to spend millions more on sweeteners to get this failed
sell-off going. A tiny fraction of this money would keep these services
going for years.''
Meanwhile, Labour is today expected to highlight the dangers of the
Government's decision to privatise BR's occupational health service,
which employs about 75 staff at 10 regional centres, including Glasgow.
Party officials are likely to warn that the move could reduce the
level of drug and alcohol screening of rail staff.

Margaret Vaughan reports that the churches may preach acceptance of
homosexuals but are still far from accepting gay sex
A FORMER Bishop of Glasgow comes out of the closet. A nurse sacked by
the RAF for being a lesbian wins court permission to challenge the
military authorities' ban on gays. Roman Catholic Cardinal Basil Hume
says love of whatever sexual persuasion is to be treasured and
respected. And along comes the Kirk encouraging its congregations to a
deeper exploration of homosexuality.
So are the bastions of the Establishment, the church and the armed
forces, at last crumbling? Has the gay movement succeeded in breaching
the final bulwarks against acceptance? No, says Ian Dunn. The battered
trumpets will have to keep up the noise for some time yet.
''You can't say, as the churches are doing, we love the person but
don't ever take your pants down. It's an indefensible attitude,'' Ian
Dunn reflects. He has spent 25 years campaigning on gay issues in
Scotland. Now he is an activist with Outright Scotland. For him, the
widening of public debate is welcome but should lead nobody to believe
that the walls of discrimination are tumbling. Eroding, maybe, slightly.
The statement by Cardinal Hume drew a distinction between homosexual
inclination and practice. It has been interpreted in many quarters as a
''softening'' of the Roman Catholic position on homosexuality. Not so,
insists Father Tom Connelly, the press spokesman for Scotland's Cardinal
Thomas Winning.
It merely reiterated Catholic teaching: ''And that is that sexual
activity outwith marriage is always morally wrong, it doesn't matter who
does it.''
Cardinal Hume's statement had been made in response to what he
regarded as a growth in homophobic attitudes and violence against
homosexuals: ''What people are interpreting is a wrongheaded idea that
Catholics regard homosexuals as outcasts. That was never so. The church
is not intolerant. We should never talk about someone being homosexual
or heterosexual. They are persons.''
The statement says: ''Love between two persons, whether of the same
sex or of a different sex, is to be treasured and respected.'' It adds
that homophobia should have no place among Catholics. It goes on,
however, to draw a distinction between inclination and practice.
While Peter Tatchell, of the militant protest group OutRage, regarded
Cardinal Hume's statement as a significant shift, the Rev Richard
Kirker, general secretary of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement said
it offered anti-discrimination support only to celibate or
non-practising homosexuals.
Outright Scotland yesterday delivered a letter to Scotland's Cardinal
Winning asking whether he agreed that gay people should be treated with
dignity, respect and fairness and whether he believed such relationships
were always morally inferior to heterosexual marriages, however loveless
or dishonest.
But Ian Dunn is not holding his breath for a positive response: ''We
thought Cardinal Hume's statement was good about 'treasuring', a new
word in the debate. But I am long in the tooth. I don't think there has
been any change whatsoever, and I am not bitter. We will carry on until
the churches agree that sexual orientation is irrelevant and what
matters is whether you are a good or a bad person.''
There is in most mainstream Christian denominations an ambivalence
towards homosexuality. Last year's fiery debate at the Church of
Scotland's General Assembly exposed the fault lines in the Kirk's
thinking.
The Board of Social Responsibility, led by the Rev Bill Wallace,
produced a report which concluded that there was no compelling reason to
alter the church's view that homosexual acts were contrary to God's
will, while deploring prejudice and maltreatment of gays.
A more controversial report by the Panel of Doctrine, which examined
sex outside marriage and homosexual activity, said that love, trust,
forgiveness and faithfulness should be the significant criteria in
assessing relationships.
After a furious debate, a working party was set up to produce
guidelines for discussion by church members. The resultant discussion
document encourages wider and more explicit debate about sexual issues.
If the Assembly approves the document it will go out to congregations
and kirk sessions later this year.
But the Rev Wallace does not believe the broad Kirk view will change,
no matter the talk: ''The church makes a clear distinction between those
with a particular sexual orientation and actual sexual acts. Equally, we
would say promiscuity by heterosexuals is wrong. It is unlikely that the
church will change its position.''
The Episcopal Church in Scotland, meanwhile, is reeling from the
decision by the retired Bishop of Glasgow, the Right Rev Derek
Rawcliffe, to ''come out'' as gay.
The church yesterday offered its support to Bishop Rawcliffe and
emphasised its tolerance of homosexuality, whether within the laity or
the clergy. But privately there was bafflement. As Bishop of Glasgow,
for a decade until 1991, the churchman was regarded as an
arch-conservative on social issues. He vigorously opposed abortion, for
example, joining forces with the fundamentalist Pentecostal Church and
the Free Church of Scotland to condemn changes to the Human
Fertilisation and Embryo Bill.
''Frankly, he was regarded as a bit of a misogynist,'' a senior church
source said. ''He was married and very doctrinaire about all issues,
even, if I recall correctly, homosexuality.''
Now, as assistant bishop in the Ripon diocese, the Right Rev Rawcliffe
is said to be the highest ranking member of the church to admit being
gay. His disclosure came in a BBC interview during which he also
supported blessings for the relationships of gay priests. He says he
came to accept his gayness when he fell in love with a young man while
in the Pacific, where he spent 30 years.
He later married and thought he was no longer gay but realised after
his wife died that he was and always had been homosexual.
There are deep divisions within Anglican ranks about the gay issue.
Hardline evangelics have called for the gay bishop to be expelled. But
the Bishop of Ripon, the Right Rev David Young, said he respected his
assistant's position.
The Archibishop of York, Dr John Habgood, refused to condemn Bishop
Rawcliffe's remarks and acknowledged that the issue of homosexuality was
a ''grey moral area'' for the church. Dr Habgood added it was ''a pity''
that a bishop had chosen to speak out in public on the matter. He
emphasised that the church's position on homosexuality was clear. It is
that gay relationships ''fall short of the Christian ideal'' and require
repentance.
What is so threatening about people of the same sex enjoying emotional
and sexual relationships? If you are in the armed forces, it seems, the
Ministry of Defence believes you can ''cause offence, polarise
relationships, and induce ill-discipline with a resultant damage to
morale and the effectiveness of the unit''.
This, anyway, was the response the MoD gave to Stonewell, the gay
lobbying organisation which backed yesterday's successful move by former
RAF nurse Jeanette Smith. She was given permission by the High Court in
London to bring a challenge against the RAF decision to sack her because
she is a lesbian.
The 28-year-old woman, who lives in Edinburgh, was dismissed last year
after being denounced in an anonymous phone call. She has now been given
leave to seek a judicial review in the first of a series of test cases
being brought against the military authorities on grounds that the ban
on lesbians and gay men is contrary to European anti-discrimination law.
After the hearing yesterday Smith said: ''I'm very happy about the
decision. There are a lot of gays and lesbians out there who are
counting on us -- I did it for myself and for them.''
The Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, has indicated that it will
vigorously defend the long-standing rules banning homosexuals from the
armed forces.
The trumpets had better be polished soon.

A SCOTS-MADE programme which is on the shortlist to replace Channel
Four's Oprah Show is the first project to receive a development loan
from the newly-established Glasgow Television Development Fund.
Elaine With Attitude, a Wark Clements/RPM Arts co-production which
features Elaine C Smith, received #5000 from the fund. It is one of
three contenders for the lucrative C4 afternoon slot, made vacant with
the departure of the Oprah Show to BSkyB.
The loan was used to make a pilot programme. A decision on the
replacement will be made later this year.
Ms Kirsty Wark, who runs Wark Clements with her husband Alan Clements,
said: ''It is absolutely vital for the growth of Scottish television
companies, particularly independents, that we look outside Scotland for
work.''

Four years ago he was floundering after a coup: now Gorbachev believes
he is the man to save Russia
TEN years ago this month, Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary
of the Soviet Communist Party and by ushering in the era of glasnost and
perestroika -- the first Russian words to gain currency in the West
since pogrom -- set out to reform an unreformable system.
Effectively he put the USSR on a course which led after some five
years of great effort and tension to its destruction and the loss of the
Soviet empire.
In Moscow this week Gorbachev, now 64, probably the world's most
celebrated has-been, was cheerfully signalling that, like France's
General De Gaulle, he was still awaiting the call from the people to
save them and the country from chaos, hardship and disaster.
Increasingly critical of Russia's leaders -- especially President
Boris Yeltsin -- and Kremlin policies generally, he is hinting that he
might run for the Duma (Parliament) in elections scheduled for December,
or more likely for presidential elections due to be held next year.
''The Gorbachev era has only just begun,'' he says. ''Gorbachev is not
history. He hasn't gone. He hasn't sold out. He is not Judas. He is
still very important. Many do not want him to take part in elections. He
finds that encouraging.''
It is not surprising that Gorbachev apparently believes he could still
make some kind of a political comeback to complement his post as head of
an economic think-tank with international links.
In his day he was a brilliant manoeuvrer, compromiser (and, if
necessary, boot-licker), a politician keenly aware of the art of the
possible. And he grasps that 10 years after he let the genie out of the
bottle, the Russian political scene is a shambles, a combination of the
apocalyptic and the absurd, with every major political event promising
Armageddon before almost inevitably proving to be muddled, confused and
bizarre.
Following the Chechnya debacle, the rampant inflation and the
breakdown in law and order symbolised by the contract killing of a
television star turned executive, Yeltsin's popularity has slumped
markedly.
His most recent appearances in public, usually complete with a puffy
face and glazed eyes -- almost certainly a combination of alcohol and
pills -- have only emphasised the deterioration in his physical
condition since he snatched power from a shattered, broken Gorbachev
some three years ago.
Nor is Yeltsin's chief political rival doing much better in the
popularity polls. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the outlandish ultra-nationalist
who became an international bogeyman after his Liberal Democratic
Party's election successes, is sounding increasingly frustrated and
lunatic at his marginal role in Russian politics.
Seizing any opportunity to grab attention, he recently paid a courtesy
call on Saddam Hussein in his Baghdad bunker. He also came out in
support of Yeltsin in the Chechnya conflict, adding that the Kremlin
should have gone even further by flattening Grozny, the capital and
leaving a huge ''crater''.
Zhirinovsky uses crude language to dismiss Gorbachev and the liberal
communists who a decade ago sought to preserve much of the old system,
but to modernise it by introducing some elements of democracy through
glasnost and perestroika.
Gorbachev he describes as a ''spotted reformer . . . who managed to
rape the entire country''. Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister and
reformist trailblazer whose party was favoured by Yeltsin in the last
elections, is written off as a ''rabid economist'', easily identified by
his ''piggy lip-smacking''.
Zhirinovsky has proved a master media manipulator and although it is
about time the Russian electorate saw through him as a demagogue and
fascist, it is hard to rule him out as a serious contender in next
year's presidential race. But it is difficult to see ''that nice Mr
Gorbachev'' slugging it out in the same political ring as ''Mad Vlad''
and Boris Yeltsin.
For the past three years Yeltsin and his Kremlin aides have been doing
their best to cut Gorbachev down to size, stripping him of the last
remnants of his former power and removing his perks -- such as an office
in the Kremlin, a VIP Zil limousine, and an official telephone.
Last week when Gorbachev returned to Moscow from an economic seminar
in Siberia he learned that the Kremlin, in another remarkable exercise
in pettiness and spite, had also removed his modest Volga car. In fact,
when the Kremlin's bullying was exposed in the Russian press, the car
was returned -- a small victory perhaps for Mikhail Gorbachev,but not
one that was going to get him very far politically.
Gorbachev is fighting an unequal battle with his former protege. He
talks about the necessity of electing ''a fresh force headed by very
experienced leaders who do not deceive the people'', which presumably
means he has himself in mind as one of those determining Russia's
future.
Gorbachev's problem is that for millions of Russians the story of
their country over the past 10 years has been one of unremitting loss
and injured pride. He became the laughing stock of the nation when his
closest colleagues and friends staged their coup against him in 1991.
Above all he is not likely to be able to represent a real alternative
to Yeltsin who, despite everything, genuinely wants Russia to go into
the next century with a market economy, a democratic political system
and a civil society.
Gorbachev and Yeltsin have something else in common. They have both
learned the truth of words written by an eighteenth-century Russian,
Ivan Pososhkov, about the task facing Peter the Great in trying to drag
his country into the modern age. For Pososhkov wrote: ''The Czar pulls
uphill with the strength of a hundred men. But millions pull downhill.''
Yet they still want to be Czar.

HEALTH boards in Scotland were accused yesterday of ''propping up''
private hospitals to the tune of #4.69m over the past six years.
The Cunninghame South MP, Mr Brian Donohoe, said the figure
demonstrated ''the thin end of the wedge'' that was being driven into
the operation of the 15 health boards.
He sought the information after last week's announcement by Ayrshire
and Arran Health Board that it was sending 23 cardiac surgery patients
to Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow at a cost of #200,000.
Only three boards -- Western Isles, Orkney, and Shetland -- indicated
that they had made no use of the private hospitals for acute medical
services in the six years up to the end of last year.
Greater Glasgow Health Board accounted for the bulk of the expenditure
-- #3.86m out of the total. Among his findings were that Ross Hall had
received a total of nearly #3m worth of business from five boards --
Greater Glasgow (#2.6m), Argyll and Clyde (#267,525), Forth Valley
(#15,000), Lothian (#25,833), and Lanarkshire (#14,000).
Other private hospitals which had serviced NHS contracts included the
Glasgow Nuffield (#535,702 from 1991-94), the St John Hospital, Aberdeen
(#97,982 in 1993-94), the Fernbrae Clinic in Dundee (#15,365 in
1993-95), the Murrayfield in Edinburgh (#406,749 in 1990-95), and the
Moat Brae in Dumfries (#42,500 in 1991-94).
The largest single contract was awarded to Ross Hall by Greater
Glasgow, for a total of #1.36m covering 80 plastic surgery, 19 urology,
and 180 cardiac surgery patients.
Grampian was the only Scottish board to indicate it had made use of
HCI in Clydebank by the end of last year, for the treatment of eight
oral surgery patients, but no cost was given.
Mr Donohoe said that there was increasing pressure on health boards to
opt for private treatment as a result of the Patient's Charter.
''No-one could argue with patients being guaranteed that they will not
have to wait long periods for medical treatment, but these figures
reveal that, due to a lack of financial resources, many health boards
are opting for cut-price treatment in the private sector rather than
being able to meet the need from NHS resources themselves.
''It is clear that many private hospitals are looking at NHS business
as a means of reducing their costs and getting their feet under the
operating tables of the NHS with a view to expanding their business.
''If the Government made available the necessary level of resources
then there would be no need for the NHS patients to be faced with the
choice of going private or not receiving the treatment they desperately
need.''
A Scottish Health Department spokesman said: ''This figure of #4m or
so is not a huge proportion of our overall annual budget of some #4000m.
We are not going to deny someone the opportunity to get treatment
quickly if the private sector can give us a good deal and reduce the
waiting list.''

Geneva, Wednesday
SOME of the world's worst violators of human rights found themselves
condemned at the United Nations today, but China foiled a US-backed
censure motion for the fifth year running.
The UN Human Rights Commission, wrapping up its annual six-week
session, passed resolutions criticising violations in Iraq, Iran, Sudan,
Burma, and others.
After furious lobbying from both sides, however, a draft resolution
expressing concern at reports of continuing rights abuses in China was
defeated by just one vote.
The 53-member Commission voted 21 to 20 with 12 abstentions against a
European draft resolution which was backed by the United States.
''The Chinese Government expresses its admiration and gratitude to
those countries who upheld justice and supported China,'' said a Foreign
Ministry spokesman on state radio in Beijing.
The strongest resolution by far was that condemning ''massive and
extremely grave'' human rights violations in Iraq, violations that were
blamed on the government of President Saddam Hussein.
The Commission decried ''an all-pervasive order of repression and
oppression which is sustained by broad-based discrimination and
widespread terror''.
Iran, another persistent offender in the eyes of the Commission, was
censured for continuing rights violations including torture and
excessive use of the death penalty.
The UN's highest human rights forum also expressed ''grave concern''
at Tehran-backed death threats against British author Salman Rushdie for
allegedly blaspheming Islam in his 1989 novel, The Satanic Verses.
Sudan was the subject of a particularly fierce resolution accusing it
of systematic torture, summary executions, and even slavery.
The Commission expressed ''outrage'' at the use of military force by
all sides in Sudan's long-running civil conflict to disrupt or attack
aid operations for Sudanese civilians.
It called Sudan to release all political prisoners, put an end to
torture, and close down clandestine detention centres.
In a resolution adopted by consensus, Burma was urged to release
''immediately and unconditionally'' Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition
leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been held under house
arrest for five years.
The resolution criticised the recent Burmese military offensive
against Karen rebels, Burmese student groups, and other parts of the
political opposition which it said was ''incompatible with the
government's declared policy of national reconciliation''.
Aside from China, another country that managed to defeat a draft
resolution against it was Nigeria, supported by African and other
developing nations on the Commission.
The draft text spoke of arbitrary detentions, severe restrictions on
the right of expression, torture, and summary and public executions. The
European Union-sponsored resolution was defeated by 21 votes to 17 with
15 abstentions.--Reuter.

<RECORDNO>979484911</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN off-duty policeman fined for punching a teenager -- overheard
telling friends he would like to throw the officer's baby out of a train
window -- is to face a disciplinary hearing, it was disclosed yesterday.
But the decision to fine Constable Richard King, trained to protect
the royal family and senior politicians, has provoked a storm of public
outrage.
Mr King, 30, who was a member of the City of London's tactical
firearms unit, was transferred to a desk job after being accused of the
assault against Mr David Hobbs on a train in June last year.
Southend magistrates found him guilty of common assault and fined him
#150 on Tuesday.
Mr King, of South Benfleet, Essex, has not been suspended from work
but it is not known if he will be reinstated to the unit if the hearing
finds in his favour. He could be sacked if it finds against him.
Mr Charlie Owen, City of London police spokesman, said the
disciplinary hearing would be conducted by the force's Commissioner
William Taylor.
''I have no idea when the inquiry will take place because it cannot
start before next week because the commissioner is away from the City,''
he said.
''It's very usual in this sort of case because when an officer is
convicted of an offence in a court of law there is an automatic inquiry.
This and other offices have been inundated with calls from members of
the public showing their support for PC King.
''If people feel very strongly we are encouraging them to put pen to
paper to express their opinions to the commissioner. There have been
some very strong views on the subject.''
Mr King's MP, Tory Robert Spink, said: ''The public must rise up and
make their opinions known so that PC King does not suffer any further.''
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, added: ''Surely if one's baby
is threatened one has to respond with force and vigour. One can't very
well call in the forces of law and order on the train and it would seem
to me that the decision of the father was exactly the kind of action I
would take myself.''
But Mr Hobbs, now 19, and also from South Benfleet, told the court:
''I made the remark to my friend. PC King was not meant to hear it. I
had no intention of throwing the baby out of the window.''

PRIME Minister John Major's doctrine that European subsidiarity --
devolution from Brussels -- stops in London is to be challenged formally
by British local authorities.
Mr Charles Gray, leader of the 24-strong UK delegation to the EU's
Committee of the Regions (CoR), said yesterday in Brussels that British
local authorities wanted legal recognition of their role in devolved
administration written into Maastricht when the treaty is revised at
next year's inter-governmental conference.
Mr Gray, former leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, denied this
was an attempt by local authorities in Britain to bypass Westminster
routinely in their dealings with Brussels. He agreed, however, that he
wanted councils to have power to challenge Westminster in the European
Court of Justice.
Such a power would be invoked in cases where the central government
ignored the subsidiarity principle at the expense of ''non-central''
government in the UK.
A group from the British local government international bureau,
representing local councils with European connections, earlier held
talks with Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's European Commissioners.
They explained that British local government wanted subsidiarity more
clearly defined.
''The existing definition only covers relations between the nation
states and the European Union -- a wider definition is needed to
encompass all levels of government,'' the delegation told the
Commissioner in a written briefing.
Sir Leon did not offer his blessing for the idea, Mr Gray said, but
said he would consider it.
Mr Gray was talking to reporters as the CoR prepares its input to the
Maastricht review when it will demand more powers and a divorce from the
non-elected Economic and Social Committee of the EU.
He said that the CoR had dropped reported ambitions to become a second
chamber of the European Parliament. But the idea that it could become an
EU institution will be discussed in Montpellier at the weekend.

THE Prime Minister has decided to delay holding the Perth and Kinross
by-election until after the Scottish local elections on April 6.
He and his advisers are believed to have been influenced by the impact
a month later on English local elections -- where the Tories have their
backs to the wall -- if the party was to lose the Scottish seat .
Mr Major's future could be at stake if the Conservatives lose as badly
in the English poll as already has been forecast. The prospect of a
challenge to his leadership in the autumn would be enhanced if the party
was to slump into third place with fewer councillors than the Liberal
Democrats.
The Prime Minister is understood to have consulted national party
chairman Mr Jeremy Hanley, as well as the Scottish chairman, Sir Michael
Hirst, and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Conservative Central Office officials argued that it would have a
demoralising effect on the English campaign if the party were to sustain
a spectacular by-election defeat the previous month.
A later date has not yet been settled. However, it could be early May,
at the same time as the English local elections, or later that month,
which would enable the Tories to use their annual Scottish conference,
held from May 10 to 12, as a launching pad for their campaign.
Mr Major and his advisers have sacrificed the advantage an April 6
poll would have given them of hindering the SNP from bussing in large
numbers of party workers from other areas.
However, national issues are likely to feature strongly in the
elections to the newly created councils and that would have strongly
influenced the Perth and Kinross campaign and vote.
The indications are that the Tories will prefer to concentrate their
campaign on the constitutional issue, attacking the SNP on separatism
and Labour on its devolution proposals.
Party sources claim to be relaxed about the possible appearance of a
Unionist candidate who would aim to reflect the frustration felt by
supporters of Ulster Unionists who are concerned at the trend of
Government policy in Northern Ireland.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''The Tories are so
divided among themselvs they don't dare to face the electorate.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said ''They can run but they can't hide. They
can play it as long as they like they are still going to be beaten.''
Sir Michael said that in deference to Sir Nicholas's family it was
felt ''inappropriate'' to hold the by-election so soon after his death
on February 19.
He said to fight the by-election simulataneously with the important
local elections would have deflected the party from concentrating on the
local issues.
He added that whenever the writ was moved ''the Scottish Conservative
and Unionist party will fight a positive campaign maintaining our
staunch defence of the Union.''
The Tories have already selected Mr John Godfrey, a London-based
banker, though with Highland roots, as prospective candidate. The
Scottish Nationalists, regarded as favourites to win the seat, choose
their candidate tonight.

From ANDREW DRUMMOND
Bangkok, Wednesday
UPPORTERS of a Thai Buddhist monk, who allegedly bedded his female
followers and visited sex clubs, screamed obscenities and threw bags of
water and itching powder over his critics as he appeared before a
religious court to answer charges today.
However the supporters of Phra Yantra Amaro Bhikku were drowned out by
loud cheers as a 10-year-old girl clutching a tin of sweets, who claims
the monk is her father, was led into the hearing.
The monk has been accused of sleeping with his followers and using an
American Express charge card to visit sex clubs in New Zealand and
Australia. He has refused to take a DNA test to prove whether or not he
is the girl's father.
At the hearing in Bangkok against the monk, who has been accused of
sleeping with a nun on the deck of a cruise liner in the Baltic Sea,
with another follower in the back of a van in Austria, and with a Danish
harpist in Copenhagen, the girl's mother gave evidence of her nights
with him while he was on a tour of Europe.
Reporters were not allowed into the religious trial at a Buddhist
temple in Bangkok.
Meanwhile the Supreme Patriarch, the head of Buddhism in Thailand, has
expressed concern about the adverse effects of the case on Buddhism and
the clergy.
At each hearing the temple is cordoned off by police. At an earlier
inquiry two women accusers of the monk were attacked by a mob and had to
be treated in hospital, while another monk who saw the incident said:
'The women would have become corpses we not intervened.''

THE winner of a #20m architectural project for Edinburgh was announced
yesterday amid uncertainty when it would be built and how it would be
funded.
The London firm of Benson and Forsyth won the #8500 first prize for a
design to redevelop Edinburgh's Cowgatehead area and extend the city's
Central Library.
But Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of Edinburgh District Council,
said that no money was available in the council's capital programme and
the Government had changed the rules for capital receipts. She hoped,
however, that the new Edinburgh council would take the project on.
The scheme to remodel and extend the Central Library to meet the needs
of the 21st century includes a children's cultural centre.
The 150 entries were narrowed to a final ll. Glen Craig Architects, of
Edinburgh, took the #7000 second prize. Third place (#6000) went to Paul
Stallan and Nick Blair, of Glasgow, and fourth place (#5500) was shared
by McGill, Granger, and Thain, of London, and Alonso and Hernandez, of
Pamplona, Spain.

PAISLEY town centre is set to get closed circuit spy cameras in a
tough bid to increase security and stamp out crimes of violence for
good.
The cost will be almost #250,000.
Councillors yesterday approved the project after hearing that 30 local
businesses, including shops and pubs and banks, were prepared to support
the plan with sums ranging from #100 to #2000.
Renfrew District Council and Renfrewshire Enterprise are each to
donate #45,000 towards the set-up costs and officials are hoping that
Strathclyde Regional Council will make a similar sum available.
Proposals to provide CCTV surveillance equipment backed up with a
24-hour monitoring team have been on the cards since the town was hit by
a wave of violence in 1992.
Licensing chiefs were so concerned about the rise in crime that a
curfew was introduced restricting access to licensed premises after
11pm. Several late-opening night clubs also had their licensing hours
cut back.
The curbs helped to reduce dramatically the number of crimes involving
offensive weapons.

EXCLUSIVE
A LEAKED Cabinet Office paper suggests the Government should argue for
a cut in the number of European Commissioners at the EU summit next
year, pointing out that it would help in Ministers' constitutional
battle with the SNP.
The paper, prepared for the guidance of the Prime Minister and the
Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, notes the right of every smaller
state to have a Commissioner has been used by the Scottish National
Party to argue an independent Scotland would have more influence in the
EU than in Britain.
However, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''This document is unequivocal
proof that the Government secretly accepts the undoubted appeal to Scots
of independence in Europe. They are now threatening a battle against all
small nations which could seriously damage the coherence of the EU. That
battle is a Tory battle, not a British one and still less a Scottish
one.''
The paper states: ''The prospects of loss of influence for the smaller
states would therefore have implications in the constitutional debate to
the advantage of the Government's presentation of the case for the
Union.''
It adds that a similar advantage would be gained if there was a cut in
the number of votes smaller states have on EU matters decided by
qualified majority voting, but concedes this would be harder to put
across in debate ''given the difficulties with public understanding of
QMV''.
Mr Salmond added: ''The Tories are terrified of Europe. This leaked
paper shows that they are also scared stiff of the SNP and Scotland.
Their reluctance to face the electorate in Perth and Kinross is ample
proof of that.
''The Government's entire approach to Europe is based on their own
narrow partisan advantage. Developments in both Scotland and Europe are
squeezing the Westminster system out and Westminster is in a panic.
''The Tories are not only anti-Scottish but are anti every one of 10
small member states of the EU. Two-thirds of the EU's member state are
small nations like Scotland and they all benefit enormously from their
independence in Europe.
''The right to appoint a Commissioner is one such benefit. Another is
having a fair number of seats in the Parliament. But the biggest
advantage is direct representation in the Council of Ministers.''
The Government's anxiety about its position in Scotland again comes to
the fore when the paper questions the advantage of giving the European
Parliament control over the details of spending on the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Ministers had appeared favourable to this as a means of further
reducing spending on CAP, which is seen as a source of extensive fraud
in the EU.
However, the paper says: ''It is by no means a foregone conclusion''
that this ''would be in our interests since the areas in which CAP
savings were made might adversely affect Scotland''. It suggests
Ministers sound ''a note of caution''.
The paper also questions another policy which has been widely popular
within the Conservative Party -- negotiating for national parliaments to
be given an enhanced role in scrutinising EU policy. It points out that
it would be desirable to ''tread carefully'' as many other EU
parliaments are ''significantly more integrationist than Westminster''.

Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the Tory cause in Perth and
Kinross could be further damaged by the possible emergence of a
candidate from the Referendum Party.
The party, backed by businessman Sir James Goldsmith, an MEP in
France, has a single-issue philosophy which broadly is that there should
be a referendum on whether Britain should agree to any further
integration in Europe.
A senior party source said yesterday that he thought it unlikely it
would field a candidate, although he did not totally rule out the
possibility.
If there was a plan to put up a candidate in Perth and Kinross, he
said,''nobody has told me.'' The spokesman said the party had had
contacts with the Tory Euro-sceptics at Westminster, and one of their
number said last night: ''I don't know about Perth and Kinross, but I
understood the Goldsmith lot were going to put up candidates in all
by-elections now.''

THE Government was planning to approve today a visa symbol for use by
all EU countries without first having the issue debated in the Commons,
whipless Tory Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor protested yesterday.
The move would effectively be ''the beginning of the end of border
controls'', he warned. Raising a point of order, Sir Teddy (Southend
East), said a common-format visa bearing a Euro-symbol would ''lead
inevitably to the mutual recognition of Euro-visas''.
He said Commons Leader Tony Newton had written only on Tuesday to the
European Instruments Select Committee saying that, while he thought
there was a case for debate, it could not take place now but might take
place later in a European standing committee.
''However, I have been advised that a specific proposal to establish
such visas is to be considered at the council of home affairs Ministers
in Brussels tomorrow and it has been reported, rightly or wrongly, that
the UK Home Office Minister will agree to it,'' Sir Teddy said.
The meeting is to be attended by Home Office Minister of State Michael
Forsyth.
PEERS called on the Government yesterday to seek a cross-party
alliance on Europe and play a positive role at next year's key EU
inter-governmental conference.
Liberal Democrat peers' leader Lord Jenkins of Hillhead called for the
return of a cross-party alliance on Europe, which he said in 1971 had
supported the-then Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath in talks on EC
membership and in 1975 had led to the ''overwhelming'' referendum
decision in favour of Britain joining the Community.
Tory former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe of Aberavon urged the
Government to play a role ''not of reluctance but of commitment -- our
future isn't to be found by turning our backs on our European
partners''.
Labour former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan said Mr Major was ''quite
unconvincing'' when he suggested a Labour government would ''give
everything away to Brussels''.
He said the Prime Minister portraying himself as John Bull ''didn't
suit him -- he really ought to give it up''.

Washington, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton expressed outrage over an attack in Pakistan
that killed two US consulate workers and wounded a third today. He vowed
that the United States would help track down the attackers.
However White House officials said the attack, one of the first to
target foreigners in Pakistan's violence-prone commercial capital of
Karachi, would not change Hillary Rodham Clinton's plans to visit
Pakistan later this month during a visit to South Asia.
''The attack on American diplomatic personnel in Pakistan outrages all
Americans,'' said Clinton. ''I have instructed relevant US government
agencies to work with the government of Pakistan to apprehend the
perpetrators of this cowardly act.''
He added: ''Attacks such as these should make the international
community rededicate itself to efforts to stamp out terrorism
everywhere.''
The State Department said the Americans were killed when a consulate
shuttle bus carrying them to work this morning was ambushed by at least
one man armed with an AK-47 assault rifle.
The shuttle had stopped at a traffic light on a main road when at
least one gunman leapt from a nearby taxi, shot out the windscreen, and
sprayed the van, hitting all three Americans, it said. The Pakistani
driver was unhurt.
The consulate had heightened security because of a spiral of violence
in Karachi in recent months, said spokeswoman Christine Shelly.
''The consulate bus appears to have been deliberately targeted, which
indicates that this was a terrorist attack,'' she said, adding that
Pakistani authorities had stepped up security for consulate personnel.
She said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sending a team of
forensic investigators to Karachi and the State Department's Bureau of
Diplomatic Security was sending personnel to boost security at the
consulate in Karachi and the embassy in Islamabad.
The dead were identified as Gary Durell, 45, a communications
technician, and Jackie Van Landingham, 33, a consulate secretary. The
third victim, Mark McCloy, who worked in the consulate's mailroom, was
wounded and in stable condition in hospital.
There was speculation that the attack might have been linked to
Pakistan's arrest and extradition to the US last month of Ramzi Ahmed
Yousef to stand trial for organising the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing
in New York.
The White House said that remained open to question, but McCurry said
Americans were being advised to ''exercise prudent security precautions
in the region surrounding Karachi''.--Reuter.

CORLEONE: People frightened by a killing spree turned their backs on
an anti-Mafia march in the Sicilian town of Corleone yesterday,
birthplace of alleged ''Godfather'' Salvatore Riina. Journalists said
only a few hundred people, mainly students from the capital Palermo,
took part in the demonstration.
''The people of Corleone deserted the protest. In some cases they even
shut their windows as the march passed by,'' the news agency AGI
reported.
Hitmen have murdered nine people in Sicily in two weeks in what is
believed to be a warning that Riina's arrest had not broken the Mafia.
Back in January, hundreds of locals turned out to protest against the
first killing in Corleone for 16 years.

<TEXT>
THE Queen is expected to visit Northern Ireland today to open a bridge
across the River Lagan in Belfast and to restore city status to Armagh,
the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland.
Notwithstanding the IRA ceasefire, a major security operation is being
mounted at both venues where the Queen is expected to meet many local
people.
Despite a week of rumours and newspaper reports, no public
confirmation of the royal visit is expected from the Northern Ireland
Office until the Queen has arrived.
Belfast councillors, including the 10 from Sinn Fein, have not been
invited to the opening of the multi-million pound Lagan Bridge. The
Unionist Lord Mayor, Mr Hugh Smyth, will represent the council.
Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams was dismissive of the visit last
night. He said: ''This is very much a local thing. I would not even be
that concerned. Mrs Windsor can come and go as she wants. Our people
will deal with that at the appropriate level.
''We don't actually have a department which deals with the Windsor
family.''
The one Sinn Fein member of Armagh council, Mr Noel Sheridan, is
expected to boycott the visit to the city despite an invitation which is
understood to have been issued to councillors to attend the ceremony.
However, the Queen is expected to meet both the Church of Ireland
Primate, Archbishop Robin Eames, and the Catholic Primate, Cardinal
Cahal Daly, during her visit to Armagh, where she will open a school.
Thirty years ago, the Queen visited Belfast to open another bridge
just 100 yards up the River Lagan, and her official Rolls-Royce was
damaged when a member of the public hurled a brick from the fourth floor
of a building she was passing.
With the outbreak of the violence, it was thought too dangerous for
her to visit the province and it was not until her jubilee tour of the
nation in 1977 that she returned -- missing out Belfast. Even then, a
bomb exploded in the grounds of the Ulster University in Coleraine,
County Londonderry, shortly after she left.
A further 14 years were to pass before she returned in 1991. Two years
later, she visited again to hold a garden party for 1200 people at
Hillsborough Castle,

Jim Freeman unveils by-law plans which aim make the banks bonnie
again.
LOCH Lomond, once an international byword for tranquil beauty -- the
exile's nostalgic Scottish ideal -- but in reality the biggest speedboat
free-for-all left in Britain, is about to undergo a revolution.
For the first time, the ever-growing ranks of pleasure boaters are to
have their behaviour governed by by-laws in an effort to preserve what
is left of the tattered environment of Scotland's best-known natural
landmark and to impose sanity on the loch's 30 square miles of water.
But for many lovers of the bonnie banks, the by-laws package devised
by Loch Lomond Park Authority comes far too late and is too weak. Their
great sadness is that the concept of tranquillity and peaceful enjoyment
has not been the central pillar of the structure.
Instead, a compromise will be put in place before summer so the
speedboat cowboys, the water skiers and the jet bikers will still,
unless they voluntarily change their behaviour overnight, be able to
rampage unhindered over 90% of the water, encouraged to do so by a speed
limit of 50 knots.
On the face of it, there is little to curb the jet skiers who have in
recent years been seen deliberately harrying young shelducks, running
them down until these beautiful birds have been driven off the island
shores where they were once commonly seen.
The water-ski boats which chased and decapitated swans in Luss Bay and
Net Bay will still be on the loch. The speedboat thugs who deliberately
cut the lines of fishermen and have tried to swamp the small boats of
elderly pensioners who have fished the loch for a lifetime, still have
licence to carry on.
That is the down side. The other side is that, according to Mr Nick
Pennington, park officer for the authority, a significant start has been
made, a foundation laid on which it may yet build.
''The pressure for by-laws started about five years ago when we began
getting requests to do something about the behaviour of speedboat
owners, water skiers and jet skiers. The pressure came from residents
around the loch, from individuals at places like Duck Bay, Luss and
Millarochy Bay, residents of caravan sites and people working around the
loch who faced daily and nightly disturbance and noise and physical
pollution.''
He adds: ''The complaints eventually centred on people water skiing
and jet skiing from 5am until midnight. The park authority became the
focus for examining what could be done. It was a major turnaround,
because when I first came to Loch Lomond, the message I was getting
about regulation was 'over my dead body'.''
The radical change in attitude came, says Mr Pennington, with the
advent of the jet ski and it happened in six months. Since the first
survey of craft was carried out five years ago, the number of boats has
remained roughly the same.
There has been a swing, however, from sailing boats and low-powered
craft to fast, high-powered boats, says Mr Pennington. The view around
the loch is that the speedboats are driving out, not only the wildlife,
but also those who seek peaceful and gentle enjoyment.
Taking the initiative, the park authority -- drawn from the four local
authorities around the Loch -- brought together all the key players,
ranging from the police to the water-ski clubs and the commercial
interests which benefit from the current set-up.
There was input from the Marine Safety Agency and from Scottish Office
lawyers, only for the whole idea to come unstuck because of inadequate
legislation.
The Countryside Act could only apply if the park authority had owned
or controlled all the loch. But it was reckoned that at least 122 people
around the bonnie banks had a proprietorial interest and, under the
weaker Civic Government (Scotland) Act, any one objector could kill off
the by-law plan.
In the event, six objectors brought matters to a grinding halt.
It was left to the Scottish Office to ride to the rescue -- after
considerable public pressure, much of it through this newspaper -- and
an amendment was pushed through Parliament removing the right of veto
and giving discretion to the Secretary of State.
The considerable public support which emerged was reinforced by a
sheriff who presided over the fatal accident inquiry into the death of a
young woman, killed in a collision between two speedboats off Inchmurrin
island.
The two local authorities directly concerned, Dumbarton and Stirling
district councils duly drafted the by-laws, which now await the
endorsement of the Scottish Office. The Herald has been told that the
Scottish Office environment department is ''doing everything it can'' to
have the by-laws in place for summer.
Every boat with an engine will thereafter have to be registered with
the park authority before it can take to the water and, when it does, it
will have to display a registration number.
As with a car, if ownership is transferred, the park authority must be
notified. The owner and master will have clear responsibilities for the
vessel's conduct.
The sea-going collision rules have been adopted wholesale, which means
that every boat on the loch with an engine must carry and display lights
after dark, sound a horn at regular intervals in bad visibility, and
adhere rigidly to the rules of the sea when vessels are approaching each
other on collision course.
Reckless navigation is an offence, as is drunken navigation. Young
people under 14 cannot drive a power boat unless under supervision.
Perhaps most important, and possibly the most contentious aspect, will
be the speed limits. Around the 100 miles of shoreline, powered boats
will be restricted to six knots -- 7mph -- when they are within 150
metres of the shore. There are exceptions around hotels, clubs and
marinas used by water skiers and jet skiers -- both of which activities
appear to require an audience to give them any point.
Areas of the loch which have been the focus of intense activity in the
past have been specially regulated. The Narrows, the area embraced by
the islands of Inchcruin, Inchmoan and Inchconnachan, are all
restricted.
Much favoured by families because of the sheltered water and sandy
beaches, the danger from irresponsible water and jet skiing had become
serious in recent summers. With speedboats carving through enclosed
water where children were swimming or playing, many feared that this
would be the site of the loch's first major tragedy.
Similarly, an imaginary line has been drawn from Ross Priory on the
bottom shore to Balmaha Pier, leaving the entire area of Endrick Mouth
with its national nature reserve, Aber Island and Net Bay as a
speed-free zone. This is an area where holidaymakers have witnessed the
hunting down and decapitation of swans, and where ospreys have sought to
hunt on the wide shallows.
In some other especially-sensitive areas, including the River Leven,
Fruinmouth and the mouth of the Endrick, speed is to be determined by
wake height, the master of each boat ensuring that his vessel will leave
a wake no higher than eight inches. This is partly for safety reasons in
restricted passageways and partly to cut erosion, allowing plants such
as the loch's wild water lillies to regenerate.
Outside the 150-metre mark and in the unrestricted areas, power boats
will be allowed to travel at 50 knots. The idea is to force the noise,
the danger and the physical pollution, particularly from water and jet
skiers, further offshore.
The areas left uncontrolled were the result of hard lobbying by the
water-ski interests and their business friends on the loch shores, who
argued for some sheltered areas where they could go in poor weather.
Water-ski boats will be forced to carry a driver and an observer to
convey the skier's signals to the navigator. The boat must also be
equipped with a rear-view mirror and a maximum of two skiers at a time
can be towed.
The laws specifically state that no water skier shall ski in a manner
which would annoy other boat users or members of the public and no water
skier should ski while under the influence of drink or drugs.
Parascending, a sport involving massively-engined boats which had
appeared on the loch in the last two summers, is banned without specific
authority and another pastime, towing ''ringos'', ''biscuits'' or
''bananas'' is restricted to 15 knots.
Loch Lomond's anglers, the oldest group on the water and --
ironically, since it has done more to preserve the loch than anyone else
-- the group which has suffered most from the increased disturbance,
also face regulation.
Few remain out after dark, but those who do will have to display
lights, and those practising the art of trolling, trailing salmon lures
behind their boat, will have to display an orange buoy or disc to warn
other users of the trailing lines.
Are the by-laws too timorous and will they be ignored by yobs and
cowboys? Mr Pennington is hopeful that they will not.
''It is a compromise. This is the first time there has been any
management on the loch, and to have tried to impose more controls at
this stage might have been counter-productive, leading to the whole
exercise failing. It is a base on which we can build in the future, but
let us first see that it works.
''I hope people do not think that everything is going to be regulated
to the last inch. It will be kept under review, but this is an
experiment which should make users recognise the potential dangers and
make them aware of the need to behave carefully in their own interest
and that of others.''
Advertisments for Loch Lomond's first water-borne rangers were placed
this week. The park authority has settled on a patrol boat which can
also be used as a work boat for laying buoys. It will not be used by the
rangers to chase miscreants.
''Had we wanted that, we would have gone for a boat capable of 60 or
70 knots,'' says Mr Pennington, ''but we are not an arm of the police.
The police will advise us on training, but we want to advise and help
people enjoy the loch in a safe and responsible way.''

A HEREDITARY peer failed in the Lords last night to gain support for
his backbench Bill which would have ensured his son was not denied the
right to inherit his title.
Peers backed by 46 votes to 14, a majority of 32, a wrecking amendment
to stop Lord Kilmarnock's Legitimated Persons (Succession to Titles)
Bill getting a second reading.
The measure would have allowed a male child to succeed his father even
where his parents had married after his birth.
Under the current rules of succession, Lord Kilmarnock's son is unable
to inherit his title because he was born out of wedlock -- even though
his birth was subsequently legitimated. The crossbench peer married his
wife five years after the birth of their son, now 23.
Lord Kilmarnock, whose title dates from 1831, told the House that his
measure was ''modest'' and cited historical precedents where patents
conferring peerages had been varied.
However, Tory Lord Morris, opposing the Bill, warned it would ''cause
chaos''.
He claimed that was why it was supported by lawyers who he said would
get so much work out of it.
Fellow Tory Viscount Oxfuird protested the Bill would have ''severe
consequences'', particularly as it would act retrospectively.
Baroness Trumpington, for the Government, said Ministers remained
neutral on Private Members' Bills but she made clear a number of
shortcomings in Lord Kilmarnock's measure which she said had been
explained to him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern.
The Queen had given her consent for peers to debate the Bill as it
would have required changes in the laws of succession to peerages. The
royal family would not have been affected by the measure.

THE chief official of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Mr
Roy MacIver, is to retire at the age of 52.
Mr MacIver told delegates on the first day of Cosla's annual
conference in Dunblane that after almost 10 years he planned to give up
the post of secretary general which is to be advertised at a salary of
around #80,000 a year.
He denied his decision was anything to do with the criticism of his
running of the convention's headquarters in Edinburgh contained in an
independent report a year ago.
The report by Strathclyde Regional Council's chief executive Neil
McIntosh was commissioned after some Cosla staff had complained of
sexual harassment and bullying.
Mr MacIver was not the subject of the complaints but his ''hands-off''
management style was criticised in the report which found shortcomings
in the internal communications at Cosla headquarters.
In all, Mr McIntosh made 16 recommendations about changing the way the
convention was administered and some senior councillors at the time
accepted privately that the situation had damaged Mr MacIver's position.
Mr MacIver admitted yesterday that he had found last year ''extremely
difficult''. But he added: ''If I felt the report had affected my
position, I would have announced my departure long before now.''
He said his decision to retire came in the context of the changes
which would be taking place both internally within Cosla and in local
government re-organisation as a whole.
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, said Mr MacIver
had been instrumental in developing policy in key areas in Scotland and
had made an extremely valuable contribution to local government and
Cosla.

dealer Mr Nick Leeson claimed yesterday that he is being made a
scapegoat by people seeking to divert blame for the collapse of Barings.
They raised the possibility that they might co-operate with the
Serious Fraud Office to build a case for extradition to London in order
to avoid Mr Leeson being sent for trial in Singapore.
''The reporting so far has not even scratched the surface of matters
which went on within the bank and the management of the bank,'' Mr
Leeson's British lawyer, Mr Stephen Pollard, told a news conference in
Frankfurt.
''Everyone seems very concerned to focus the blame on Mr Leeson.
That's neither accurate nor fair.''
Mr Pollard said: ''Everything he did, he did as an employee of
Barings, he did for Barings Bank and hoping it would be to the advantage
of Barings. There's no suggestion that there was any personal gain to Mr
Leeson.''
He conceded that the possibilities of fighting Singapore's extradition
request were ''strictly limited'' under German law.
But he added: ''If there were an extradition request from England,
that would open up all sorts of alternatives to an extradition to
Singapore. It's certainly our best hope.''
Mr Leeson's German lawyer, Mr Eberhard Kempf, said they might seek to
help build a case for Mr Leeson's extradition for trial in Britain.
''It's not an ordinary procedure to try to get an extradition request
for a client but this isn't an ordinary case. If we felt he's going to
be extradited to Singapore we would definitely prefer him to go to
London.''
Mr Pollard said Mr Leeson, 28, had given them ''very interesting
information about what was going on in the bank'' at the time of the
crash and the period leading up to it.
They might offer help to the SFO ''if it were sought''.
Mr Pollard said he had spent five to six hours with Mr Leeson on
Tuesday and yesterday in Hoechst Prison, Frankfurt, where he is being
held without bail while Singapore puts together its extradition case.
''He's calm, he hasn't lost his sense of humour, he's confident, he's
coping very well with his imprisonment.
He dismissed reports that Mr Leeson was greatly disturbed and had come
close to suicide.
Mr Pollard said Mr Leeson had not ''fled'' Singapore with his wife
Lisa, but had taken a holiday.
When he read that Barings had collapsed and police were seeking him,
he decided to fly back to Britain where he felt more comfortable about
dealing with the situation.
''They had left Singapore knowing there was a problem with the bank,
that Mr Leeson's trading had not been successful,'' said Mr Pollard.
Leeson sent his letter of resignation the following day because he
knew there was a problem which might lead to his sacking, but he had not
had the slightest thought that the bank was about to crash.
It was three days later that they learnt of the crash when they
happened to see an English language newspaper in the Malaysian resort of
Kota Kinabalu.
The newspaper also mentioned they were being sought by Malaysian
police.
''Their first thought was to get back to countries they understood,
where they knew the system, where they felt they would have got a fairer
hearing than in the Far East,'' said Mr Pollard.
''There was a flight to Frankfurt leaving the following morning. The
next flight to London was either one or two days after that.
''They took the point of view that they were best to take the flight
to Frankfurt with the view of phoning a British solicitor from Frankfurt
with a view to meeting them off the plane at Heathrow.''
The SFO said it was too early to say if it would be seeking to
extradite Mr Leeson or anyone else.
But investigators are likely to note with interest the tentative --
and highly unsual -- offer of help from lawyers representing a possible
suspect.
Barings refused to comment on the claim that Mr Leeson had been made a
scapegoat for the failings of the bank's management.
It will say nothing on the issue until after an official inquiry into
the collapse has been completed.

CABINET Secretary Sir Robin Butler admitted last night that he had
been ''careless'' in a key part of his report which cleared Treasury
Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken of alleged impropriety.
Sir Robin made his admission before the Treasury and Civil Service
Select Committee at Westminister.
His report at the height of the ''sleaze'' row last year detailed his
investigation into allegations that Mr Aitken had a free stay at the
Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Sir Robin told the MPs he had looked into the affair on the orders of
the Prime Minister who had not wanted to be seen ''sitting on his
hands'' about the allegations.
He admitted under cross-examination from Tory backbencher Quentin
Davies (Spalding) that his report had referred to Mr Aitken and his wife
paying their bill at the hotel in full.
Mr Davies said: ''One of the salient facts about this was that Mr
Aitken and his wife were not staying at the Ritz. Mr Aitken was staying
alone at the Ritz.''
Sir Robin replied: ''You are right that the word 'their' should have
read 'his'. I was careless.''
He agreed he had not interviewed House of Fraser chief Mohamed
Al-Fayed, a key player in the saga, but he said: ''I interviewed the
witnesses to the extent I thought necessary.''
Mr Davies quoted Sir Robin's report as finding the evidence against Mr
Aitken to be ''entirely unsubstantiated'' or ''demonstrably false''.
Labour's Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) told him
that Cabinet Secretaries were ''compromised'' when they did the ''dirty
work'' of Prime Ministers.
''To many people, it will look as if you were used by Jonathan Aitken
to give some credibility to what remains a very opaque episode,'' she
added.

WORKERS in Scotland received the lowest increases in average earnings
last year at just 1.3% compared to the UK average of 2.7%, according to
a new study from the Low Pay Network.
Analysis of Government statistics shows that average earnings figures
conceal massive pay divisions by areas, occupations and gender and that
relatively few higher paid workers can mask low pay by distorting
averages.
Greater London had the second lowest average increase last year at
1.8% while other areas enjoyed rises averaging between 3.5% and 3.7%.
Regional divisions between pay levels remained ''enormous'' with
workers in Scotland earning #114.70 a week less than the #415.50 London
average.
Although average earnings rose by 2.7% to #325.70 in the year to April
1994, the difference between regions and occupations and between men and
women was ''massive'', said the Low Pay Network.
The report's co-author, Ms Morag Gillespie, said the figures showed
that regional disparities in pay were persisting. She added that there
were significant areas of low pay in all regions although in several,
including Scotland's oil industry, it was masked by some people earning
very high wages.
The gap between male and female earnings showed a slight improvement
over 1993/1994 with women receiving 72.2% of male earnings compared with
71.6% in 1993.

THE EAST Lothian town of Port Seton, a popular destination for
holidaymakers, is to undergo a #3m facelift.
East Lothian District Council yesterday unveiled plans for a
redevelopment at the town's east promenade covering an area including
the now redundant swimming pool and pond hall, a derelict fairground
site and garage.
Included in the project are:
* A new promenade with landscaped gardens, a cycleway, play areas,
pleasure boat and lily ponds;
* A ''Gala Square'';
* A landscaped ''eastern gateway'' to Port Seton including a civic
sculpture;
* A special needs housing block, built under a restored pond hall
clock; and
* Visitor shelters, birdwatching facilities and viewpoints.
The council is hoping to get funding by developing partnerships with
private and public sector organisations. It will also seek cash aid from
the European Union and the National Lottery.
The project has been welcomed by the town's recently expanded Seton
Sands caravan park, which accommodates 3500 people in the summer.

Brussels
A POLITICAL scandal gripping Belgium and threatening the leadership of
Nato claimed another victim yesterday when the former chief of staff of
the country's air force was found dead, apparently having committed
suicide.
Lieutenant-General Jacques Lefevre, 65, was found in a hotel room near
his home in central Brussels the day after being implicated in the
so-called Agusta scandal which now clouds the future of two of Belgium's
most prominent politicians, Mr Willy Claes, secretary-general of Nato,
and Mr Karl van Miert, European Competition Commissioner.
The general is thought to have poisoned himself after being named as a
conspirator in a corrupt arms deal by a lawyer recently taken into
custody.
His death is the latest sensation in the saga which has made a heroine
of a Belgian investigating magistrate, cost the careers of three
Ministers, and caused the murder of a prominent political fixer, who was
gunned down in a Liege car park after promising to tell the full story.
His killers, suspected of working for the Mafia, have never been caught.
Mr Claes, one of Belgium's most popular and respected politicians, and
Mr van Miert have denied wrongdoing but their futures are seen as
threatened by the scandal.
Agusta is an Italian firm of helicopter manufacturers which won a
#200m contract, allegedly by corrupt means, to supply the Belgians with
46 attack and reconnaissance helicopters in 1988.
After the deal was agreed, the treasurer of the Belgian Flemish
socialist party -- to which Mr Claes and Mr van Miert belong -- was
found to have received more than #1m from the Italians. The money was
paid into a Swiss bank.
In 1991 Mr Andre Cools, former leader of the Walloon socialists in
Liege, was shot dead in a local car park. He was a political kingpin and
his death caused a shock in Belgium.
Examining magistrate Mrs Veronique Ancia concluded that Mr Cools had
been involved in shady dealings.
Her inquiry was hampered by local officials but she broke through when
the Italian authorities, carrying out their own ''clean hands''
corruption inquiry, raided Agusta's offices and found a fax sent to a
Belgian. It talked of ''reassurance'' for the Belgian socialist party.
When Mrs Ancia charged three Ministers, they all resigned, almost
causing the fragile Belgian coalition government to collapse. She coaxed
the Swiss authorities into naming the beneficiaries of the Swiss bank
account.
They were found to be associates of the Flemish socialists. They were
picked up along with Mr Etienne Mange, a former party treasurer who
admitted receiving the #1m via the Swiss account.
After his arrest, Mr Mange implicated Mr Claes. He said that Agusta
had not offered a bribe, merely a ''donation'', and that Mr Claes knew
of this. Mr Claes has denied any such knowledge to Nato ambassadors.
Mr Claes has always denied any knowledge of a financial offer from the
Italians. Last week, however, he suddenly admitted he had a ''vague
memory'' of an offer, but had taken nothing to do with it. He says he
intends to remain in his new post in Nato.
Lt-Gen Lefevre's death yesterday takes the scandal for the first time
into the heart of the Belgina military. He was air force chief of staff
when the government took the decision to buy Agusta's helicopters.

MEASURES to curb greenhouse gases have been a resounding success,
according to new Government figures yesterday. By the turn of the
century, the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere
is set to fall below 1990 levels by up to 13m tonnes of carbon.
This is in sharp contrast to the target set by then Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher five years ago to peg CO[2] at 1990 levels by the year
2000.
Environment Secretary John Gummer told a London news conference the
success had been achieved through big reductions in the amount of coal
burning for electricity generation and more use of gas and nuclear
power. He claimed that Government privatisation of the utilities had
helped.
''I think this is a triumph of liberalism of the market place that we
foretold,'' he said. ''I am pleased that on this occasion the crystal
ball turned out to be true.''
Britain's commitment to cutting greenhouse gases from industry and
traffic was backed up by Mr John Major in 1992 when he signed the
Climate Convention at the Earth Summit.
Labour and some green lobby groups claimed the Government's
predictions were ''hopelessly optimistic''.
Research by economic forecasters published last month warned that
increased use of oil products for private and public transport would
cause Europe to miss its target of stabilising emissions of greenhouse
gases.
Mr Bob Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North East, said the UK could
not hope to achieve stabilisation by 2000.
He said: ''These figures are ridiculous. Government policies aimed at
reducing carbon monoxide emissions have failed catastrophically. I
calculate they are at least 40% short of their target.''
However, Greenpeace said the Government's prediction that it could cut
emissions of the global warming gas CO[2] by between 10% and 15% showed
that it could go much further.
''The Government has done virtually nothing to achieve this target. It
is obvious that, if proper measures were introduced to encourage
efficient energy use, the UK could meet a 20% cut in CO[2] emissions
within 10 years,'' said Mr Matthew Spencer, Greenpeace atmosphere
campaigner.

A POLICE officer with 27 years' experience spoke of his relief last
night after being cleared at Stirling Sheriff Court of using police
computers to help a friend beat a speeding charge.
Police Constable Donald Woollhead, a custody officer at Stirling, is
believed to be the first officer in Scotland to have been tried under
the 1990 Computer Misuse Act.
At the end of a day-long trial, Sheriff Robert Younger said he was not
prepared to draw inference of guilt against Mr Woollhead, who had denied
using the force's Trace computer to search for details of speeding
offences.
Afterwards, Mr Woollhead, who will learn over the next two weeks if he
is to face an internal disciplinary inquiry, said: ''After 17 months
with this hanging over me, I'm delighted.''
He said he had been practising on the force computer at the time the
prosecution alleged he had logged in to look for information to help his
friend.
During the trial, the court heard that Mr Woollhead, 47, of Gartclush
Gardens, Bannockburn, had been a friend for over 20 years of the man he
was accused of helping, lorry driver Daniel McPhail.
Mr McPhail, 48, of Muiralehouse Road, Bannockburn, told the court that
when he was booked for speeding in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, in April
1993 he noted the registration number of a woman driver being handed a
speeding ticket at the same time.
He called the woman as a witness at his trial at Alloa Sheriff Court,
and after she gave evidence showing traffic police had been booking two
drivers at the same time -- possibly confusing the readings on a radar
gun -- the case against him was found not proven.

AN RAF nurse sacked for being a lesbian yesterday won leave to
challenge in court the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.
Miss Jeanette Smith, 28, of Albert Street, Leith, was granted the
go-ahead at the High Court in London to seek judicial review of the
decision to sack her last November.
It is the first in a series of test cases being brought against the
Ministry of Defence on grounds that its ban on lesbians and gay men is
contrary to European anti-discrimination law.
If the cases succeed, the Ministry could have to pay millions of
pounds in compensation.
Miss Smith's counsel, Mr Rambi de Mello, said the European directive
could be applied to discrimination against homosexuals. The armed
forces' policy on homosexuality was both irrational and unlawful.
The judge, Mr Justice Latham, said the RAF had started its own
internal appeal procedures but had not indicated that its policy was up
for reconsideration.
''The policy itself is one with which people may have strong views
both ways, which creates problems,'' he said.
The Ministry said it would vigorously defend its long-standing rules
banning homosexuals from the armed forces. It now has 38 days to prepare
its side of the argument so the case can go to a full hearing.
Stonewall, a gay rights pressure group, and Rank Outsiders, which
supports gays and lesbians in the forces, say at least 300 other men and
women have been sacked in the last five years, and many intend to take
action if the test cases succeed.
Outside the court Miss Smith hugged her partner, Margarette Fleming,
30, before they faced the media.
She said: ''I'm very happy about the decision. This is the
breakthrough we needed. There are a lot of gays and lesbians out there
who are counting on us -- I did it for myself and for them.
''We've got a very long way to go, but this is a start. Hopefully now
I've opened the floodgates, others will follow.
''The MoD is wrong. Who someone sleeps with has absolutely no bearing
on how they do their job. It's as simple as that.''
The RAF has a policy stating that ''homosexuality, whether male or
female, is considered incompatible with service in the armed forces''.
When Miss Smith was discharged last November, her certificate said her
services were no longer required because she was ''unable to meet
service obligations through circumstances beyond her control''.
Her counsel argued that her relationship with her lesbian partner was
analagous to a marriage, and they were entitled not to be treated
differently from other married couples by the military authorities.
After the hearing, Stonewall's director, Ms Angela Mason, said the
Ministry's ban was ''wicked and cruel'' and amounted to blatant
discrimination.
''It's extraordinary that in this century people can still be
witch-hunted on the grounds of their sexual activity,'' she said.
Ms Mason said that most European and Nato armed forces did not ban
homosexuals, but Ministry of Defence police had branches dedicated to
tracking down gays and lesbians within the ranks.
She also contrasted the treatment received by homosexuals with that of
the four Parachute Regiment soldiers who were allowed to stay in the
Army despite pleading guilty in court last month to a serious attack on
a civilian.
A number of similar test cases are pending and are likely to be taken
eventually to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Copenhagen, Wednesday
THE United Nations summit to fight poverty, unemployment, and social
injustice marked International Women's Day today by declaring that women
were the biggest victims of all three.
''There is no single group which illustrates the three themes of this
conference better than women,'' UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said in a speech to the Copenhagen gathering.
''The highest percentage of unemployed are women, the poorest of the
poor are women, the socially marginalised and excluded are women,'' he
added.
''Poverty cannot be eliminated, productive employment cannot be
expanded, and social integration cannot be achieved unless women wholly
and equitably participate in social development.''
The UN estimates that about 1.3 billion people live in chronic poverty
and that 70% are female. Over the past 20 years the number of women in
extreme poverty grew by 50% while the rate for men was 30%, UN data
shows.
In her summit address, US First Lady Hillary Clinton announced a #62m
aid package from Washington to fight female illiteracy in the developing
world and called on other governments to follow suit.
''I am pleased to announce today that the United States will allocate
$100m over a 10-year period to provide enhanced educational
opportunities for hundreds of thousands of girls and women in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America who currently live in poverty,'' she told
delegates from more than 100 countries.
''I respectfully urge other governments to join the United States in
creating or expanding the opportunities for all women worldwide,'' she
added.
In her Women's Day speech Mrs Clinton hammered home the plight of
women in developing countries and their unequal share of the world's
ills.
Elsewhere around the world women used the the day to put across a
serious message.
In the Somali capital Mogadishu, hundreds of women marched to call for
peace between the country's rival warlords.
Women in Rwanda marked the day by recalling an even greater tragedy,
at a ceremony at a tiny chapel near Kigali where some 300 women and
children were butchered by a Hutu death squad.
Women's Affairs Minister Aloyisia Inyumba said girls as young as 12
were still giving birth after being raped by the militiamen who
slaughtered their families.
She launched a programme of mass adoption of the 120,000 abandoned
children in the country. ''Everybody in Rwanda should have a family,''
she said.
In Algeria, a three-year civil war between the Government and Muslim
fundamentalists has left 10,000 widows an 140,000 orphans, according to
a family victims' association.
Women held a symbolic ''trial'' in an Algiers hotel and held the
Muslim hard-liners responsible for the violence.

RESCUERS yesterday found the bodies of three climbers who had been
caught in an avalanche and swept 1000ft down a mountain in Glencoe.
They were identified last night as a group from the Greater Manchester
area who had gone missing at the weekend. The discovery was made during
a search on 3345ft Buachaille Etive Mor.
It brings the official number of deaths in Scottish climbing accidents
this year to 14. In addition, six climbers are still missing. They
include another group of three, from West Yorkshire, who disappeared in
the same area of Glencoe two weeks ago and are also feared to have died
in an avalanche.
Northern Constabulary named the three found yesterday as Mr Gregory
Taylor, 30, of Sale, Mr Simon Blundell, 34, of Westhoughton, Bolton, and
Mr Kevan Ashurst, 29, of Lymm, Cheshire.
Their bodies were found in a snow-filled gully below Curved Ridge.
Police and rescuers said the climbers had been hit by an avalanche as
they were coming off the ridge and hurled 1000ft down the face of the
mountain.
The trio were only reported missing after they failed to return to
work after a planned long-weekend's climbing trip.
Mr Taylor's wife, Paula, first feared something had gone wrong on
Monday night. She raised the alarm early on Tuesday morning before
travelling to Scotland to be nearer to the search site.
Her mother, Mrs Sheila Taylor, said: ''Paula first suspected something
may have happened when Greg did not ring her on Monday. At first, she
was more cross than worried as he often goes away for the weekend and
will not get in touch. But when she called his office on Tuesday and
discovered he had not been in touch, she raised the alarm.
''Greg liked it when the weather conditions were severe. He always
said it had to be bad to be good.''
The six climbers still missing on Scottish mountains include a father,
his 18-year-old son, and the son's friend, all from West Yorkshire, who
are feared to have died in an avalanche on Buachaille Etive Mor two
weeks ago.
Another climber, from the Manchester area, fell through a snow cornice
on Ben Nevis earlier in February.
Two men have been missing in the Cairngorms since Saturday. Mr Allan
Mitchell, 22, of Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, and Mr Graham Holland,
22, of Rossendale, had set off on a week-long climbing trip. The search
for the pair resumed yesterday but in scaled-down form and rescuers have
all but given up hope of finding them alive.
Mr Mitchell, who worked in a mountaineering shop in Keswick, wanted to
become an instructor at the Glenmore Lodge Outdoor Pursuits Centre in
the Cairngorms.
His father, Brian, said: ''He was told he needed more experience of
winter climbing in Scotland before he could be considered for the job.
That is why he went up there. Both he and Graham are experienced
climbers.''
The 14 deaths resulting from mountain accidents this year include Dr
Ian Barnett, 31, of the Doctor's Residence, Law Hospital, Carluke,
Lanarkshire, who died earlier this week as a result of injuries he
received almost three weeks ago when he slipped 200ft down Creag
Meagaidh, near Laggan in Lochaber.
His climbing companion, Mr Ewen Fraser, 29, of Eglinton Street, Beith,
Ayrshire, is in a stable and satisfactory condition in intensive care at
Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

A MOTHER strode from the public benches into the well of a court
yesterday, stood in front of a young woman in the dock, and told her:
''You killed my son.''
Moments earlier 18-year-old Debbie Hardy had been cleared of causing
the death of Greg Turner, a passenger in her car went it crashed upside
down into the Cromarty Firth.
The jury at Tain Sheriff Court found her guilty of dangerous driving
and of speeding on the Alness-Invergordon road last June.
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn had dismissed the jury and left the
bench ''for five minutes'' to consider the sentence when Mrs Kath Turner
made her emotional outburst.
Hardy's smiles of relief at being cleared of causing Mr Turner's death
turned to tears as Mrs Turner strode up and confronted her.
Shaking with emotion, Mrs Turner told the accused: ''To think your own
sister is disabled and in a wheelchair because of the same kind of
driving. You killed my son. I hope you can live with it. I can't. You
have taken our son.''
Moments later the sheriff, fiscal, and the sheriff clerk returned to
the court unaware of what had been said.
Sheriff Booker-Milburn fined Hardy, a hairdresser, of Queen Street,
Invergordon, a total of #1000 and banning her from driving for four
years and ordering her to resit her test. He said that if she had been
found guilty of causing 18-year-old Mr Turner's death by dangerous
driving, he would have had ''no hesitation'' in imposing a lengthy
period of imprisonment.
Hardy had a co-accused, 18-year-old Clare Mackay, of Delny Farm
Cottages, Invergordon. She was found guilty of careless driving and
racing and was fined a total of #600, banned for two years, and ordered
to resit her test.
The sheriff, who described the pair's driving as ''stupid and wholly
irresponsible'' said racing, as they had done, was just as bad as
dangerous driving.
He expressed his sympathy to the relatives of the dead youth and said:
''I will do everything in my power to stop this sort of speeding,
especially on that stretch of road.''
The three-mile Alness-Invergordon road is notorious for young people
speeding. The trial had heard of smoking tyres and Hardy and Mackay's
cars driving bumper to bumper at high speed.
What started as an exchange of V-signs between the two cars as they
''cruised'' Alness ended when Hardy's car left the road and plunged
upside down into the Cromarty Firth.
Mr Turner was said to have been the only person in Hardy's car to try
and stop his friends egging her on to go faster and catch Mackay. He
died a day later from his injuries.
Outside the court Hardy refused to say anything, but Mrs Turner said:
''It is unbelievable that girl went out and drove like that when her own
sister was crippled because of the same sort of driving.
''The boy who was driving at least admitted it. She has shown no
remorse and has not even said she is sorry for what happened.''
Mr Turner's father, Reg, said: ''She should have been jailed for the
dangerous driving. It's the only thing that's going to stop this sort of
thing.''
During the trial the court was filled daily with young people from the
surrounding area.

<HEADLINE>Island councillor at odds with conservation group over reason for his board dismissal Quarry backer ditched by SNH</HEADLINE>

AN ISLAND councillor has been removed as a member of Scottish Natural
Heritage's North West Regional Board because he publicly criticised the
group's opposition to the superquarry at Lingerbay on Harris.
However, Mr Angus Graham, vice-convener of the Western Isles Council,
believes his hostility to a scheme to grant the Countess of Sutherland's
family #150,000 not to fell trees on its land, finally lost him his
board seat, and the #6000-a-year that went with it.
Mr Graham supports the quarry, as does the Western Isles Council,
because of the jobs it will bring. He was quoted in last week's edition
of the Skye-based West Highland Free Press as saying the conservation
group had made a fundamental mistake in objecting to the superquarry,
and that its case was flawed.
Yesterday, he received a letter dated March 4 from writer and
scientist Sir John Lister-Kaye, who runs a field centre near Beauly, and
who chairs the group's regional board: ''I am deeply dismayed to see
that you have again hit out at SNH in last week's West Highland Free
Press.
''You will remember our clear agreement that, after the events of last
year, in particular our meeting in the Station Hotel in Inverness, or
with Mr Magnus Magnusson at the Stornoway Office launch, and my letters
of May 19 and June 7, you would not make any statements about SNH to the
press without clearing it with me or Mr Peter Tilbrook (regional
director).
''You will know that your two-year appointment to SNH's North West
Regional Board technically runs out at the end of March, in three weeks
time. I had genuinely hoped to be able to continue without any changes
to the board for another year, but this requires my clear recommendation
to the main board at Tuesday's meeting and, because I have put my head
on the block for you twice already, I do not feel that I am in a
position to make that recommendation.''
Yesterday, Mr Graham replied to Sir John categorically denying that he
had ever given him or Mr Magnusson an undertaking to toe the SNH line on
Lingerbay.
Mr Graham recalls Sir John publicly criticising Highlands and Islands
Enterprise for cutting back financial support for environmental
education. He had been asked if he was speaking on behalf of the
regional board.
''You insisted that you had been making a personal observation, but
neither you, nor the press, made that distinction. Neither did you
mention that your own organisation had been in receipt of HIE funding
for environmental education.''
Mr Graham tells Sir John: ''I firmly believe, however, that a more
important reason for you terminating my board membership has been my
opposition to your proposal to establish a national nature reserve at
Loch Fleet, on land owned by a trust of the Strathnaver Sutherland
family.
''I still believe it would be a scandal for SNH to rush to give
#150,000 of public money to a private landowning family trust, for a
scheme whose real conservation value is, to say the very least, highly
questionable. It would serve only to confirm the worst public perception
of quangos, the propriety of the way they operate, and do an enormous
disservice to SNH, which could undermine its future work.''
Mr Graham challenges Sir John now, to consider whether his close
involvement with the Loch Fleet project has undermined his ability to
act as an impartial chairman.
After receiving Mr Graham's letter, Sir John told The Herald that
there was no truth in the suggestion that debate was stifled on the
board, where members had every right to disagree, or try and influence
SNH policy. That was different from always conducting debates in the
press.
''The Loch Fleet project, meanwhile, played no part in my thinking on
Mr Angus Graham. The negotiations are still going on, so I cannot really
comment apart from to say it would mean a first rate nature reserve
which could make a very positive contribution.''

<HEADLINE>Windermere points to bitter experience on speed limits</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979484941</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE word from south of the Border -- particularly from Lake Windermere
and Poole and Langstone harbours in Dorset -- in relation to Loch
Lomond's by-laws is not encouraging.
''How long will it be before the Scottish authorities come to the same
conclusion that we did?'' asks Mr John Nash, one of the senior planners
at the Lake District National Park.
After years of trying to regulate the use of fast powerboats on
Windermere, to curb water skiing and jet skiing in the interests of
safety and the environment, the national park authority conceded defeat
and sought a by-law to impose a blanket 10mph speed limit on the lake.
Such was the outcry, headed by lakeside businessmen who claimed the
speed limit would cost 730 local jobs, that a public inquiry was called.
The result is due this spring, but there appears to be limited room to
manoeuvre. Mr Nash believes the answer will be a straight yes or no,
with the possibility of a ''no, but''. Everything would then depend on
what the but is.
The fact is that Windermere had deteriorated into little more than a
hellhole, choked with cars round its shores and choked by speedcraft on
its waters.
The Countryside Act of 1968 allowed the lakes to be regulated and
10mph limits were imposed at Ullswater, Derwentwater and Coniston Water.
Boat numbers have actually increased there over the years, as
small-craft owners took advantage of the safer conditions.
It was hoped at that time, says Mr Nash, to regulate Windermere
without coercion, so the steering committee never managed to come to
grips with levels of noise or speed. They could find no consensus, no
simple solution. Registration of all craft appeared to offer a solution.
''We thought we could keep the lid on the different activities if we
had the power to licence the different craft and their numbers and the
terms on which they operated,'' he says, adding that in the late 1980s
that became an unattainable goal. A private Bill was promoted in
Parliament but because of the objections it went nowhere.
In 1991, matters came to a head. The Windermere park authority reached
the conclusion that it was 16 years since it said the lake would be open
to powerboats but, with the dramatic change in circumstances, it was
time to think again. The original concept of quiet enjoyment in the
national parks was dusted off and the collision course set with the
commercial interests.
''It was a different world. There had been an increase in the size of
powerboats, an increase in their numbers, in their speed and in the
times they were used. It had become impossible to reconcile with the
idea of quiet enjoyment,'' he states.
The decision to fight for Windermere has cost the authority around
#450,000, money which the national parks could have put to better use.
Ironically, those most bitterly opposed to the speed limit, the power
boating interests, are not regarded as a major economic factor in an
area which attracts between four and five million visitors a year.
There may be a lesson there for Loch Lomond, where the pressures from
commercial interests appear to have had a dominant say in the philosophy
behind the by-laws.
In places like Poole, the pressure from water skiing, jet skiing and
power boating has reached breaking point.
Poole Harbour has imposed a blanket speed limit of 10mph and has zoned
areas for water skiing and jet skiing. It has been forced to redraw its
by-laws in the face of the increasing misbehaviour, which resulted in a
boy being killed a year ago.
Assistant harbour master Mr John Milner says they now have very strict
rules for water skiing, brought in last year, as the harbour became more
dangerous. Speeds of 40 knots were not unusual, he says, with 4000
vessels on the water at a time not an unusual sight.
As with Loch Lomond, there is a right of navigation on Poole Harbour.
That means that regulation has to be concentrated on safety reasons.

THE Government and Sinn Fein are approaching a key point in the
delicate process of bringing them into political negotiations for a
stable peace in Northern Ireland.
Britain requires that the IRA begins handing over arms such as Semtex
explosives, ground-to-air missiles, and heavy machine guns before it can
claim the right to a meeting with a Government Minister.
Sinn Fein, reacting to comments made by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew in Washington on Tuesday, still is demanding that there
should be no preconditions to it taking part in the political
negotiations of the peace process.
Although Sir Patrick insisted in the Commons that there was ''no
change whatsoever'' in the Government's position, Unionists and some
Tories angrily claimed that Ministers were now ''in full retreat'' in
the face of IRA intimidation.
However, Mr Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Fein, said yesterday: ''I have
been involved in discussions on and off and contact with representatives
of the British Government for the last five years. Never at any stage
did the British Government mention that there had to be a
decommissioning of IRA weapons. This issue has only come on stream since
the IRA cessation of August 31 last year.''
Mr McGuinness claimed that the British Government was changing the
rules.
The shadow-boxing has reached a delicate stage, with the Ulster
Unionists at their most anxious about how to proceed towards political
negotiations.
They have produced a suggestion for a formalised handing over of
weapons to be supervised by an independent and foreign army general,
preferably Canadian. The paramilitary loyalists also have to be
convinced that the IRA is prepared to hand over offensive -- as opposed
to defensive -- weapons. On this issue, the peace process could stall.
Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley said people in the province saw
the ''so-called ceasefire and peace process'' as being of advantage to
the terrorists.
He said: ''The IRA can at this time dictate when this peace can be
broken and in the interim the Government are dancing to a tune of
concessions in order to keep the Provisional IRA sweet ...
''The fact is that the IRA has no intention whatsoever of
decommissioning or surrendering arms.''
Meanwhile, last night, representatives of the Protestant
paramilitaries said that they too wanted ministerial contact.
In the Commons, Home Secretary Michael Howard announced that he was
lifting exclusion orders on republicans formerly banned from travelling
to mainland Britain.
However, the Government is insisting on maintaining for another year
the rigorous provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
MPs voted overwhelmingly last night in favour of retaining the Act.
Its continuation for another year went through by 314 votes to 212 as Mr
Howard confirmed to the Commons that he was lifting 16 of the 56
exclusion orders currently in force.
However, he made clear he had considered whether it would be possible
to go further and had not done so for two reasons.
First, it was clear that if the ceasefires broke down there might be
very little warning, if any, and without doubt many of the targets
would, as before, be on this side of the water.
Second, the police remained satisfied that among those still excluded
were some who would be likely to play some part in mainland terrorism
were it to resume.
''I shall continue to keep the need for each of the orders under
review, but I am not prepared to take unnecessary risks at this stage,''
he said.
The Home Secretary referred to the thorny issue of surrender of
weapons, and appeared to reflect the softer line on this issue taken by
Sir Patrick Mayhew.
Mr Howard said: ''It remains the Government's earnest hope that those
who have previously supported the use of violence to advance their cause
can be brought fully and irrevocably within the political process. That,
of course, means that there needs to be substantial progress on the
issue of decommissioning arms and explosives.
''It would, in our view, be wholly irresponsible to dismantle our
defences while the paramilitary organisations remain intact, while they
continue to carry out brutal punishment beatings, while their command
structures, weapons and explosives remain in place and while they retain
the capability to resume violence at very short notice.''
The Government would keep the situation under review, and there was a
better chance now than at any time in the past 21 years that an end may
soon be in sight to such annual debates.
However, he added, the prospects remained uncertain.
For Labour, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw made clear that the
official Labour line was voting against renewal of the Act because the
Government had failed to agree to a comprehensive review of all
anti-terrorist legislation.
''In the changed circumstances of a sustained ceasefire, now is the
time to review precisely what anti-terrorist legislation we need. Labour
wants a bi-partisan approach in this area and I greatly regret that the
Government has not accepted the proposals we have made to achieve the
consensus we seek.''
THE HOME Secretary last night pledged that he will never authorise
damages payments as a result of the challenge to his exclusion orders
policy by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in the European Court.
Mr Howard was pressed by angry Tories amid fears that the case could
lead to claims by up to 500 other IRA sympathisers who have been banned
from Britain at some time under emergency laws.
Tory Terry Dicks (Hayes and Harlington) angrily demanded ''that
irrespective of what any European Court says about Adams this Government
will take no notice of that and flatly refuse to pay him and his ilk any
money at all''.
Mr Howard replied, to Tory cheers: ''I shall never authorise any
payment of damages as a result of this case.''

A SCOTTISH water treatment company yesterday announced what it
believes is a big breakthrough in the battle against legionnaire's
disease.
The Deveron Environmental company of East Kilbride has developed a
treatment system which it says can combat the legionella bacterium
responsible for the disease.
The system was launched yesterday in Glasgow at the biggest
environmental exhibition and conference ever held in Scotland.
Mr Robert Wilson, a director of the firm, has spent two years
researching the problem. He explained: ''Cooling towers associated with
cooling water systems provide the ideal habitat for the bacteria to
multiply.
''Treatment of cooling water systems has depended on regular cleaning
and disinfection, using bleach and ongoing chemical dosing, to minimise
corrosion and effect good microbiological control. This traditional
treatment is not always effective because it cannot remove or control a
thin microbiological layer -- the biofilm -- which is present in 90% of
water systems.''
His company's approach to the problem was to remove the biofilm and
other surface debris which could harbour the legionella bacterium, by
using a powerful but environmentally-friendly biocide which had Drinking
Water Inspectorate approval for use in potable water.
''Quite frankly, our claim is that our treatment removes biofilm and
traditional treatments do not,'' said Mr Wilson.
The firm says that the system, known as DELTA PA (Deveron
Environmental Low Toxicity and Polymer Assist), has already been put to
use and is a proven success. It is being launched through 20
distributors in the UK and there are plans for expansion into Europe and
the US.
Deveron is working with the Viscona company of Hawick to produce the
chemicals used in the system.
It acknowledges research into the problem undertaken by Mr Jimmy
Walker, a Scot, at the Government's Porton Down centre for
microbiological research, and says it will continue to be associated
with the centre.
The system was launched at the combined Envirotec '95 and Scottish
Water and Effluent Treatment event at the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre.
The two-day event, which has attracted about 200 exhibitors, was
officially opened by Mr Brian Fitzgerald, chairman of CBI Scotland's
environment committee, who said industry wished to play its part in
creating and sustaining a healthy environment in Scotland while creating
wealth and employment.
''Industry does pollute and should not hide from this, but recognising
the issues is only a first step. There is a long way to go before each
and every company meets its environmental responsibilities.''
The event organiser, Mr Don Morrison, revealed plans for a conference
in Aberdeen this autumn to debate the shape of water and sewerage
services as Scotland's three new water authorities prepare to take over
these services from regional councils.

Cape Town, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela today ruled out meeting his estranged wife,
Winnie, saying he had delegated his deputy Thabo Mbeki to deal with the
controversy over her behaviour and allegations of corruption.
''Mr Mbeki is handling this matter. Mr Mbeki is a highly gifted and
resourceful leader and it is a matter that is within his capacity,''
Mandela told reporters in the garden of his Tuynhuys office in Cape
Town.
Mandela recently instructed Mbeki to talk to Mrs Mandela, a deputy
minister in his government of national unity, about allegations of
corruption in housing deals and a breach of discipline when she
travelled to West Africa in defiance of an order to cancel the trip.
The deputy minister of arts and culture has refused, however, to meet
Mbeki, telling him by letter that she would discuss the matter only with
Mandela.
* The British High Commission said the Queen was likely to honour
President Mandela on her first state visit to South Africa later this
month. However spokesman Nigel Casey said it need not be an honorary
knighthood, and added that speculation that Mrs Mandela might take the
title ''Lady'' was misguided.--Reuter.

THE cause of a farmer's death remained a mystery after an inquest in
his home county of Gloucestershire yesterday.
Mr Clive Warner, 55, was found dead at Hardgate Farm, Bonnykelly, New
Pitsligo, near Aberdeen, last November 10.
The deputy Gloucester coroner, Mr Alan Crickmore, said there were
signs that he had shot himself accidentally with his double bore
shotgun.
But the evidence was not conclusive enough for him to record an
accidental death verdict, he said.
Instead, he recorded an open verdict on Mr Warner, who had moved to
Scotland from Stonehouse and Eastington, near Stroud, Gloucestershire.
Mr Warner's wife, Beryl, found him lying dead on the road outside
their home at 5.45pm.
His shotgun was lying nearby with one cartridge spent and the only
significant clue to the cause of his death was a footprint from his
wellington boot in the earth on top of a nearby stone wall.
PC Kevin Goldie, who investigated the death, said that earlier Mr
Warner had spoken about going out to shoot a wild goose on his land in
preparation for a visit by his son the next day.
On the day of his death he had seemed ''cheery'' when he said goodbye
to his wife in the morning and he had no financial worries.
Mr Crickmore said there was no evidence pointing to suicide but the
only evidence suggesting an accident was the footprint on the wall and
that was not enough to reach a firm conclusion that death was
accidental.

A MAN who spent 13 years imprisoned with South Africa's President
Nelson Mandela was in Scotland yesterday urging business leaders to
bring jobs to his country.
Mr Tokyo Sexwale, Premier of South Africa's Gauteng region, was
released in 1990 after being held on Robben Island for alleged terrorism
and conspiracy to overthrow the old regime.
Now he is in government himself spearheading South Africa's bid to
attract international investment and create quality jobs and conditions
which would not seek to exploit black workers.
Mr Sexwale, who today meets the Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, in
London, said he was in Glasgow ''to touch base with Scotland -- a part
of the UK quite well known in South Africa''.
Yesterday, after meeting CBI chiefs and Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall,
Mr Sexwale said: ''We recognise that Britain is a critical investor for
South Africa.
''We must address the question of quality of life of our people and we
recognise that can only be done by encouraging job creation. We must
broaden the base of ownership and the economy of South Africa.''

A LEGAL action is expected today in a bid to block the screening of a
BBC Scotland documentary tonight which purports to expose ''appalling''
standards of care for the elderly in a Lanarkshire nursing home.
The owners of Orchard House in Crossford yesterday threw its doors
open to The Herald and declared: ''We have nothing to hide.''
Nursing staff broke down in tears and also strenuously denied the
allegations in the Frontline Scotland programme, shown to the media in
advance of scheduled screening.
Residents also insisted that they have no complaints about standards,
and expressed shock that their home could close if allegations following
the two-month undercover investigation are proved.
Secret footage is at its most disturbing when showing a man allegedly
confined to a ''restricter'' chair for up to 24 hours a day and at risk
of strangulation if sliding down.
But his wife and daughter last night declared that they have no
concerns about his treatment. They prefer him to be in the chair,
supervised throughout the night, rather than be ''doped up'' to ensure
he stays in bed.
Ms Lilias McAdam, 40, of St Nicholas Road, Lanark, said the family has
complained to the BBC about the footage, and added: ''We are seeking
legal advice with a view to court action.''
''We believe the care at Orchard House is fabulous, and has done
everything possible to help him. We do not want him doped up, and prefer
he is allowed, when necessary, to sit up in a chair which does not hurt
him or keep him totally still and he can talk to staff.''
In the programme, five registered or auxiliary nurses -- no longer
working at the home -- catalogue alleged indignities suffered by
residents which would breach health care guidelines.
The five include Ms Adele Bryson, who resigned last year then lost an
industrial tribunal action against the home. Two relatives of former
residents are also featured, expressing concern at a lack of stimulation
or care at the home, where weekly bills for the 63 residents are
#330-a-head.
Allegations include grave shortages in emergency first aid and oxygen
equipment, and:
* Face-cloths, also used to wipe bottoms, being used by more than one
resident, with the cloths washed rather than boiled;
* A scabies outbreak, blamed on poor hygiene in the laundry, and:
* Clothes, including underwear, being passed on from former residents,
including some who had died.
The home owners -- former policeman Raymond Baigent and his wife
Margaret -- deny any impropriety.
They gave The Herald free rein to walk about the property, which was
warm and well-appointed, and also speak to residents and staff.
However, their lawyers had last night sought an interim interdict in
the Court of Session to prevent publication of the programme's contents
because its allegations were said to be ''grossly defamatory''.
The application was rejected by Lord Morton of Shuna, who ruled that
freedom of the press should be upheld as far as possible.
He added the pursuers would have the remedy of damages if anything was
said that was defamatory to them.
The Baigents, who have not seen the programme, earlier told The Herald
that they would have talked to the BBC had a direct rather than covert
approach been taken when it was being made.
They also claimed the allegations arise from long-running feuds over
the purchase of Orchard House; financial rows in connection with a
former resident, and past troubles with disgruntled staff.
In the documentary, ex-auxiliary Cathy O'Hare, 42, of Carluke, alleges
the home is like looking in a shop window and seeing a cake. But, she
adds: ''You have to be a resident at a nursing home to know that
underneath the icing it's rotten.''
Colleague Adele Bryson, a registered nurse, now working at Law
Hospital, also denied her complaints of the home follow the industrial
tribunal failure. She stood by the allegations, and said of their
rubbishing at Orchard House: ''I have done nothing wrong other than be
the whistle-blower . . . everyone is entitled to their opinion.''
Former employee Sandra McCulloch confirmed she did not raise concerns
with authorities over an 18-month period, relying only on an an
anonymous letter from a staff member sent to the health board. She
argued no-one would have believed an auxiliary.
Auxiliary Margaret Clelland, at the home since it opened more than six
years ago, cried when told of the allegations. Her father-in law has
been a resident, and she has recommended the home to villagers in
Crossford: ''We have to clear our names. I could not have worked here if
it was as portrayed.''
Enrolled nurse Jean Patterson, also of Crossford, said: ''I do not
know why such things are being said. We have nothing to hide.''
Resident Catherine Tomney, 82, whose family visits twice a week, said
of the home: ''It's very good. The nurses are nice. We are well looked
after. I hope it does not close. It is my home.''
Friend Nan Burt, 88, said: ''I have never seen anything bad here. We
are well looked after. It could not be better.''
The oldest resident, Molly Thomson, 94, said on told that registration
could be withdrawn: ''Oh, no. I do not want to go anywhere else. They
are very nice people, and will do anything for you.''
Lanarkshire Health Board, the registers, said yesterday: ''We can
confirm the board is currently investigating allegations in relations to
aspects of the running of Orchard House nursing home. Investigations are
on going. When concluded, we will consider what action, if any, will be
appropriate in response to the findings.''
The BBC said undercover filming was instituted after hearing ''many
complaints from a number of sources.'' A spokesman said the owners were
asked for an interview but declined, and added: ''We stand by the
programme and will leave it to the viewer to decide whether Orchard
House is a well-run nursing home. We will oppose any application for any
interdict.''

<HEADLINE>Damages for limbo dancer</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979484954</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HIGH Court jury in London yesterday awarded a limbo dancer #36,401
damages against the Metropolitan Police over a beating-up which ended
his career.
But most of the award to Mr Gabriel Thomas will be swallowed up by
legal costs which he must pay after refusing a police offer of #40,000
to settle the case.
Mr Thomas was on the verge of the big time before the incident after a
charity telethon at the London Arena in Docklands in May 1990, the court
heard.
Known as King Gaby, he was one of the best limbo dancers in the world
with the ability to go under a bar just seven or eight inches from the
floor.
But persistent pain in his rib-cage after the assault meant he no
longer had the flexibility and balance needed to perform, his QC, Lord
Gifford, told the judge, Sir Michael Davies.
Mr Thomas, 37, of St Katherine's Way, Tower Hamlets, east London, had
to turn down a #25,000 touring contract and was now unemployed.
Lord Gifford said the police arrived as Mr Thomas was leaving the
venue after an argument with a security guard, who mistakenly thought he
should not be on the premises.
He was pushed against a wall, thrown to the ground and kicked, dragged
by his hair to a van and detained at Limehouse police station for six
hours.
He was charged with using threatening behaviour calculated to cause a
breach of the peace, but acquitted by magistrates.
By a majority of 10 to two, the jury found Mr Thomas had been
assaulted and awarded him #15,815 general damages, #16,185 plus #4,091
interest for lost earnings, and #310 for damage to his stage costume,
dentures, watch and shoes.
But it rejected his claims of false imprisonment and malicious
prosecution.
The Metropolitan Police said it did nothing wrong. It claimed Mr
Thomas was justifiably ejected from the venue, was abusive to officers
and no excessive force was used against him.

THERE wasn't much time for celebrations yesterday for the couple from
Leith.
Their trek down to London had required a 5am start and the avalanche
of media interest after the court hearing had taken its toll.
''I think we are too exhausted,'' Miss Jeanette Smith said.
Her victory has propelled her overnight into celebrity status as a gay
rights champion, but it has not been an easy battle.
''I have been as low as I can go. I have thought about jumping off
Arthur's Seat, but I have brought myself out of the depths and I am
ready to fight'', she said.
Miss Smith joined the RAF at the age of 23 and realised she was
lesbian two years later.
''In five and a half years with the RAF, my conduct was exemplary. I
had been recommended for promotion twice but the minute they found out I
was a lesbian they decided I was unable to do my job'', she said.
Her relationship with her lover, Miss Margarette Fleming, would
scarcely turn an eyebrow in civilian life. They live quietly and
responsibly, acting as legal guardians for Miss Fleming's 17-year-old
niece.

EXCLUSION orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act have never
stopped a single infiltrator from entering the British mainland with
malice in mind.
The only people who have been kept out of Britain are media figures
such as Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, along with about 50
known activists who could have caused problems for the Government by
exposing the secret talks with the IRA or raising civil rights issues in
public.
The real terrorists came ashore from fishing boats or other craft on
the west coast of Scotland. The Brighton bombers, the active service
unit which almost wiped out the Tory party's top echelon on the eve of
their annual conference, landed by boat at Ayr under cover of darkness
before making their way south.
The 12-mile North Channel between the Antrim coast and Scotland was a
secure highway for both sides of the sectarian divide. The Provisionals
sent active service units east. The loyalists sent weapons west.
Despite the best efforts of the Royal Navy, that traffic was seldom
interrupted. The semi-permanent presence of a patrolling warship in the
busy channel was a purely psychological barrier. The two-way flow
continued virtually unabated for 25 years.
The only real benefit of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to the
security forces has been the right to detain suspects for up to seven
days while withholding the bulk of their civil rights, and the right to
question them without legal recourse to tape-recorded interviews.
The law, renewable annually, also provides for easy access to
extensions of custody on the flimsiest of grounds. Suspects regularly
spend up to 14 days under interrogation with no legal representation if
police or security forces presented even a shred of a prima facie case.
However, the mainly IRA targets of the legislation have had to be
caught on the mainland before that could be done. It happened from time
to time. The James Gray Street arrest of a Provo active service unit on
the south side of Glasgow made headlines.
The truth behind it was that the almost bungled raid on a block of
tenement flats had stretched police resources to the limit. The police
had also refused help from the Army's special forces. In the end, they
were lucky. Nobody died in an assault which could have cost many lives.
Under the unwritten rules of the game, there were few complaints when
real terrorist teams were captured and questioned. The screams of
anguish occurred over the more public and sensitive area of civil
rights.
Sinn Fein always claimed the Act contravened not only British domestic
law but also breached the conventions of European legislation. Mr Adams
argued forcefully that Britain's EU membership gave him ''freedom of
expression and freedom to reside and move freely within the territory of
member states''.
The Government's view has always been that freedom of expression and
movement, while inherently important, have to take a back seat to the
more pressing issue of national security.

MAGNUS Magnusson yesterday called on Scottish landowners to accept
that designations such as sites of special scientific interest were
facts of modern life with which they could live and draw considerable
benefit.
Mr Magnusson, the chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage was addressing
the Scottish Landowners Federation conference in Perth. He said that SNH
thinking had moved on from seeing designations as the ''be all and end
all'' for nature conservation.
''Designated islands of specialness cannot ensure the long-term
survival of species; air pollution is no respecter of boundaries and
climatic change may force the migration of species anyway. We have to
look beyond the bulwark.
''Besides trying to 'protect the best and forget the rest' ignores the
fact that conservation is for people too and that means valuing the
commonplace and the accessible as well as the rare and remote.''
He added that there had been a shift in perspective since the days
when conservation and development were polar opposites.
SNH was offering a helping hand with the difficult transition from
yesterday's short-term yield to tomorrow's all-embracing philosophy of
sustainability, he said.

THIRTEEN Scottish beaches were highly praised for the quality of their
bathing water and facilities in a survey published yesterday.
The latest edition of the Reader's Digest good beach guide, produced
in association with the Marine Conservation Society, lists almost twice
as many recommended Scottish sites as last year's version, which had
seven.
One beach, at Gullane, has been downgraded, but the publishers were
yesterday unable to give an exact explanation for its lower status.
Those awarded the guide's recommended ranking are: Thorntonloch, White
Sands Bay, near Dunbar, and Belhaven Beach, Dunbar (all Lothian);
Silversands, Aberdour, Shell Bay, Earlsferry, West Sands, St Andrews,
and Tentsmuir Sands (all Fife); Lunan Bay and Montrose (both Tayside);
Balmedie and St Combs (both Grampian); Nairn Central and Dornoch (both
Highland).
The society admitted that a large number of other Scottish beaches,
especially on the west coast and islands, could merit inclusion, but
scientific data about the water conditions was not available.
However, it was critical of the standards of beaches in many parts of
the UK, where it described bathing as ''like swimming in a public
toilet''.
Many fail to meet minimum European bathing water standards, including
Blackpool, Great Yarmouth and Brighton, said the society.
A total of 900 beaches are listed in the guide, but a
''disappointingly low'' number met the stringent water quality standards
laid down by the MCS.
Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt says in the foreword: ''It is an
unfortunate fact of life that for many of us the average trip to the
seaside involves unpleasant encounters with sewage, sewage-related
debris and sometime sickness -- not the best ingredients for a nice day
at the beach.''

THE charities' watchdog in England is investigating the Child Aid
Foundation, the children's charity chaired by Major General Graham
Hollands, a close friend of the Duchess of York.
Several representations have been made to the Charity Commission based
in London about the organisation.
The Scottish Charities Office in Edinburgh said it was aware of the
concerns and the interest shown by its English counterpart.
However, it added that it ''was not policy'' to discuss what, if any,
complaints had been made against the organisation north of the Border.
One complaint to the Charities Commission has come from the British
Institute For Brain Injured Children which is currently treating a
two-year-old girl from Giffnock, Glasgow, who has cerebral palsy.
The institute has written demanding to know where the cash the Child
Aid Foundation allegedly promised it has gone.
Mr Keith Pennock of the institute, based in Bridgwater, Somerset,
said: ''We deal with many families from Scotland and give them help and
advice.
''We have one family here just now and have a number of others waiting
to come down.
''Thirty-five Scottish children have followed our home programmes and
more than three-quarters of them made significant progress with their
sight, hearing, speech or mobility.
''All we want to know is where the money we expected for the institute
has gone.''
Other charities to complain include Meningitis Research, the
Meningitis Trust -- which up until last year funded a research programme
in Edinburgh -- and the Cot Death Foundation.
Major General Hollands, 53, met the duchess on the ski slopes several
years ago and is on the board of her personal charity, Children In
Crisis.
A spokeswoman for the duchess said in a statement: ''Major General
Hollands has been on the board of her personal charity, Children in
Crisis, since March 1994, during which time he has made a significant
contribution to the charity's projects.
''Children In Crisis is aware that Major General Hollands is working
with the Charity Commission in an informal inquiry into the charity,
Child Aid.''
Child Aid was set up by South African John Tungay to advance education
and relieve poverty, distress and suffering of children in any part of
the world. He is said to have quit two weeks ago through ill health.
No-one from Child Aid was available for comment yesterday.

ONE of Scotland's leading criminal lawyers, Mr Donald Findlay, QC,
yesterday launched a scathing attack on the campaign to abolish the
controversial not proven verdict.
He led an all-party line-up of top advocates who publicly joined
forces to defend the verdict and attack the handling of the issue by
Labour, and in particular Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
They chose to make their move on the eve of the Labour Party
conference in Inverness. Delegates are likely to debate the issue, and
it was claimed yesterday the party is on the brink of adopting abolition
of the verdict as policy.
Mr Findlay, a supporter of the Conservative Party, described attempts
to abolish the verdict as ''fundamentally ill conceived'', and said Mr
Robertson had leapt on the issue ''in a scandalous manner''.
The campaign to abolish the verdict gathered momentum following the
Amanda Duffy case, when a not proven verdict was returned against a man
accused of her murder. Public concern over that verdict led to a
petition being presented to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, calling for its
abolition.
''I have every sympathy with the Duffy family,'' said Mr Findlay.
''But George Robertson turned it into a political issue because he
perceived it as an issue that could be turned to the Labour Party's
advantage. I believe it was done for purely cynical motives.''
Mr Findlay said he believed the number of acquittals would rise if the
not proven verdict was abolished. ''People do not want, as a jury, to
convict, because they know that that involves prison and all the rest of
it. They won't do that unless they are sure that they have got the right
man.
''If you have two verdicts the inclination will be 'we are not going
to take that big step to guilty unless we really are sure'. That is why
I believe the acquittal rate will go up.''
Mr Findlay added that the not proven verdict would not be abolished in
the lifetime of the present Government.
The Labour Party is currently consulting its members on the future of
the verdict. However, it was also claimed yesterday that the
consultation process was being undermined by the desire of senior party
members to adopt abolition as party policy.
The attack on Labour's handling of the issue came from advocates
representing all of Scotland's main political parties at a briefing
called by the Muir Society -- an organisation of Labour and radical
lawyers -- in Glasgow.
They included Mr Gerry Carroll an advocate and Labour councillor, Mr
Hugh Mathews, QC, the Scottish National Party's legal affairs spokesman,
and advocate Mr James Reilly, a member of the Liberal Democrat Party.
Mr Reilly said: ''It is impossible to overstate the importance of this
matter and, equally, it is impossible to overstate the importance of a
full and frank debate on this issue.''
Mr Carroll launched a thinly veiled attack on what he saw as attempts
by senior Labour Party members to force through a policy without proper
consultation.
''Clearly some members of the party have decided that the not proven
verdict should be abolished prior to the consultation process coming to
a conclusion.''
Mr Mathews said that the fact that sheriffs and magistrates sitting
alone -- without a jury -- used the verdict, was proof of its viability.
Mr Robertson could not be contacted for comment last night, but a
spokesman said: ''The not proven verdict proposal was made in a
consultation paper. That paper was produced by an independent committee
of legal experts.
''Mr Robertson has already stated in the second reading of the
Criminal Justice Bill that the issue should be the subject of a free
vote.
''Mr Robertson has always opposed the not proven verdict on principle,
not just on the grounds that the Duffys are his constituents.''

TWO power companies yesterday denied they have changed their policy by
conceding the need to bury underground sections of the power line which
forms part of the planned #175m undersea interconnector linking Scotland
and Ulster.
The denial came as the senior counsel for ScottishPower and Northern
Ireland Electricity, Mr Donald Mackay, QC, made final submissions at the
public inquiry into the scheme which began in Ayr on October 4.
Rejecting the U-turn suggestion Mr Alan Rainey, NIE's group manager in
charge of projects, said: ''We have made no changes to the basis for our
applications for the required consents, which have been fully examined
by the public inquiry over the past five months.
''As our closing submissions at the inquiry makes very clear the
application is for an overhead power line. There has therefore been no
U-turn.''
Mr Rainey added: ''We have always accepted that one result of the Ayr
Inquiry could be for conditions to be attached to any consent granted.
''We have been at pains to emphasise the implications of such a
condition being imposed.
''If, however, any condition were to call for the undergrounding of
sections of the power line these would need to be very carefully
examined.''
The local authorities involved came in for heavy criticism from Mr
Mackay as he summed up the power companies' case to the Scottish Office
Reporter, Mr James McCulloch.
Mr Mackay said it was clear that the three authorities -- Strathclyde
Regional Council and Cumnock and Doon Valley and Kyle and Carrick
districts -- had been against the project from an early stage, and
having decided on such outright opposition they failed to give the
project the kind of proper consideration and assessment that the power
firms and the public were entitled to expect.
It is expected that the outcome of the inquiry will become known in
January.

MARRIAGE is an institution; as is prison, it was once famously
remarked.
That might not have leapt to the minds of Elizabeth Weston and Charles
Millar, a bride and bridegroom from Glasgow, as they sealed their union
at Oban Register office, but they might more readily have made the
connection later as they spent the first night of their married lives
behind bars, as did John Kennedy, their best man.
The wedding had gone well up until about midnight last Friday at
Oban's Regent Hotel.
The function had been boisterous but good-natured, said manager Hamish
McKinnon, until a row allegedly broke out in a bedroom leaving one man
injured. The incident was dealt with jointly by police and hotel
security. In all, 14 guests had to be ejected from the hotel.
Police granted Miss Weston's request, made in the form of loud and
continuous protests, not to be parted from her new husband on their
wedding night by arresting her in connection with an alleged breach of
the peace.
A police spokesman stressed that the pair spent the night in separate
cells and confirmed: ''Three people have been reported to the

A friend, who did not want to give her name, answered the door at the

<HEADLINE>Ministers are accused over workers' rights</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979484979</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL furore erupted last night after a Labour MP published a
''leaked'' circular which, he said, showed Ministers wanted to deprive
temporary workers of rights by ending their contracts just before they
qualified for them.
Publishing the document at Westminster, Mr Richard Burden said it
stated: ''All new temporary appointments in the Employment Service will
be limited to 51 weeks.'' The MP for Birmingham Northfield said the aim
was to avoid workers qualifying for full employment rights.
He said the document was clearly not meant for public viewing, and
recipients were instructed to ''destroy 31 July 1995''.
The document, entitled Dept of Employment ES Personnel Notice 5/95,
showed the work history of potential recruits was to be checked to
ensure that the prospective employee would not have cumulatively worked
for the qualifying period to gain full rights if he/she was employed, he
said.
It stated: ''If it is not checked, we might later find that the
individual has already worked for up to two years and might now be in
the position of having enough service to qualify for a wide range of
employment rights.''
It goes on to instruct personnel staff never to promise a good
temporary member of staff another job at the end of their contract.
Mr Burden said: ''The efficiency implications of disregarding good,
proven staff are to be ignored in the Government's obsession with
ensuring employees have no rights.''
He said Employment Secretary Michael Portillo's department should be
''setting a good example to employers. Instead they are saying
Dickensian conditions are welcome -- even in the Government's own
backyard.
''The Government's obsession with denying people job security means
they would rather sack good, proven staff than allow them basic
employment rights.''
Later, Mr Burden's office issued copies of the leaked document which
made clear that the document states: ''All new temporary appointments to
the ES will be limited to 51 weeks''.
The Employment Department denied the document revealed changes to the
way casual staff were being treated within the service.
The document was simply a reminder to personnel managers that they
should not abuse temporary staff who could not be promoted within the
service.
''It is a reminder to them that if they have to bring in casual staff,
then they should not abuse the system. If they need to fill a position
on a long-term basis, they should be going through the proper
recruitment procedures.''

Renfrew District Council hope to introduce the low-cost household

Householders who wish to join the scheme will be able to pay weekly

The minimum weekly cost -- #1.35 or #1.05 for pensioners -- will

FORMER Scottish organiser of the Labour Party in Scotland, Mr Jimmy
Allison, warned yesterday that he had ''a lot more up his sleeve'' if
his detractors unfairly criticised him over his book Guilty by
Suspicion, which reveals the in-fighting in the Labour Party.
The book is being published just as Labour is holding its Scottish
conference, and when there are divisions over leader Tony Blair's
attempts to change the party's Clause 4.
Mr Allison, who yesterday presented a copy of his book to Glasgow's
Labour group leader Pat Lally, said he would be at the party conference
to discuss the contents of the book, which details how he was forced out
of office because he disagreed with the censorship from London
headquarters.
''I respect the views of ordinary party members who may well be
critical of me, and will accept that with the seriousness it deserves,''
he said. ''Anyone who wants to discuss it with me is fine. There won't
be the slightest hassle.''
As to whether he was just settling old scores with the book, he said:
''That's rather a sour way of putting it. I think it was more of
correcting some inaccuracies.''
Councillor Lally had no doubts on where he stood on Mr Allison's
ability. He said: ''Jimmy Allison really was the finest organiser I have
ever known. I think it's been a pretty sad loss for the party that we
haven't had his services for the past few years.''
So far publishers Argyll Publishing have produced 2000 copies of the
book which will officially go on sale tomorrow.

ANTI-smoking campaigners were understandably fuming yesterday when an
imaginative No Smoking Day media event went embarrassingly wrong.
The Action on Smoking and Health organisation had gone to great
expense to hire a hearse for the day as a prop for photo opportunities
for newspaper and television cameramen in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The gleaming vehicle, which did not carry a symbolic coffin but bore
the more subtle message, ''Smokers' Compartment'', was to have been
driven around central Edinburgh and Glasgow as a reminder to
tobacco-users that the habit could lead to an early demise.
However, its mission ended abruptly when it broke down on the A8 near
Edinburgh Airport on the way to the first engagement and failed to
appear for either of the photocalls.
The hearse could not be said to have gone up in smoke but the
mechanical problem was so serious that the vehicle was still immobile,
with the bonnet up, several hours later.
Later, Ms Alison Hillhouse, chief executive of ASH, said: ''It was
very disappointing, because there was a lot of media interest. There was
nothing we could do. There wasn't another hearse available.''
Meanwhile, figures out yesterday claimed that cancer will affect more
than ten million people worldwide by the turn of the century.

A COUPLE whose baby son needed repeated hospital care because of his
asthma turned the tide on his illness by giving up smoking.
Stewart and Chrisleen MacPherson, this year's No-Smoking Day Quitters
of the Year, told yesterday of their guilt as they watched David, now
two, struggling for breath.
Their other sons, Jonathan, 6, and Paul, 4, rubbed it in when they
watched the smoking warnings on television and asked their parents:
''Are you going to die?''
The last straw was just over a year ago after they had been up most of
the night caring for David.
''We woke up next morning and decided, that's it, no more
cigarettes,'' recalled Mr MacPherson, 26, after they had received their
prizes -- they were also regional winners for Argyll and Clyde area.
The Greenock couple, who will spend a weekend at the Troon Marine
Highland Hotel, now have a baby daughter, Lauren, four months, who they
were determined would be a smoke-free baby from the outset. David,
meanwhile, has not had to go back to hospital once since they stopped.
''It has made a difference to me too -- I felt like an old man when I
was smoking, out of breath all the time, now it is as if the chains have
been taken off from round my chest,'' said Mr MacPherson.
Mrs MacPherson, 27, who has smoked for eight years, said: ''The
cravings lasted for a couple of months but they have passed now. You
have to be determined to do it.''
The couple, who smoked 20 a day each, reckon they have saved #1700
over the past year by not smoking.
The Health Education Board for Scotland, who organised the national
competition, estimate that smoking causes one in six of all deaths in
Scotland, and according to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Scottish
women have the highest rate of tobacco-related deaths in the world.
Models are joining a campaign to stop smoking in the fashion business
and to set an example to teenagers.
The Put Smoking Out of Fashion movement, backed by the Health
Education Authority, aims to counter the new ''realism'' in fashion
images and its impact on young people.
The models have the campaign logo printed on their cards to tell
prospective clients they will not use any tobacco products within
fashion photography.
They are backed by an HEA report, Smoking and Fashion: A Fatal
Combination, by Dr Paul Cobley and Adam Briggs, senior lecturers at the
London Guildhall University.

ACTRESS Elizabeth Hurley yesterday became the new multi-million dollar
face of cosmetics company Estee Lauder after a two-year search among the
world's most beautiful women.
The long-term contract will catapult her to international fame and is
reported to be worth several million dollars.
Miss Hurley, 29, the girlfriend of film actor Hugh Grant, is scarcely
known outside Britain.
Estee Lauder said it had made an exhaustive search and more than 15
women were considered. ''In Elizabeth, we have found the ideal Estee
Lauder International woman. Women worldwide can relate to her warm and
charismatic beauty,'' said the American company's president, Jeanette
Sarkisian Wagner.
Miss Hurley, who caused a sensation at the London premiere of Grant's
Four Weddings and a Funeral film in a revealing Versace dress held
together with safety pins, will initially appear in adverts for the
company's new fragrance.
On screen, she had her first break in the title role of Dennis
Potter's TV drama Christabel and went on to play a murderous flight
attendant in the film Passenger 57.

THE former Scottish Episcopal Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, the Rt
Rev Derek Rawcliffe, revealed last night that he was not aware he was
gay while he worked in Scotland.
Mr Rawcliffe said it was long after his wife died, in 1987, that he
had faced up to the prospect of his homosexuality.
''People might say that it is easy for me to admit that I am
homosexual now I have retired, but that is not the case. I was not aware
then that I was homosexual.''
Speaking from his home in the village of Bardsey, between Leeds and
Wetherby, the 73-year-old cleric added: ''When I married I thought I was
no longer gay. I went on thinking that until circumstances forced me to
realise that I still was, and always have been.''
Mr Rawcliffe, who is now an assistant bishop in the Church of England
at Ripon, is believed to be the highest member of his Church to ''come
out''. He was bishop of Glasgow and Galloway from 1981 to 1991.
He admitted on Tuesday's BBC2 Newsnight programme that he was
homosexual, and said he was in favour of blessings for the relationships
of gay priests.
Mr Rawcliffe said he had taken the decision to go public in the hope
that it would ''cause the Churches to consider their position in
relation to homosexuality''.
However, Scottish Church leaders showed no signs yesterday of
softening their traditional attitudes to practising homosexuals, in the
face of Mr Rawcliffe's revelations.
Glasgow's Roman Catholic Cardinal Thomas Winning stated his Church's
position was that people with a homosexual orientation were not
condemned, but physical homosexual activity was seen as morally wrong.
Mr Bill Wallace, convener of the social responsibility committee of
the Church of Scotland, said: ''We accept that some people have a
homosexual orientation, but we are strongly of the view that genital
sexual acts are wrong.''
While not criticising practicising homosexuals, the Scottish Episcopal
Church did not support them either yesterday. A spokesperson for the
Scottish Episcopal Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, the Rt Rev John
Taylor, said: ''The Church has no official line or policy on this issue.
Within the Church there are a wide variety of views.''
Mr Rawcliffe yesterday refused to answer questions about whether he
had engaged in gay sex, and criticised Churches who draw a distinction
between homosexual orientation and practice, saying ''that is a false
distinction''.
''There was a time some years ago when I did take another view and
would have separated orientation from practice. And I think that is both
false and cruel, to say we are gay but not allowed to exercise that.
''If God was really saying that, that would be cruel. We don't say to
heterosexual people 'well God has made you, God has given you this
sexuality, but you have not to use it'. Part of our human existence is
giving and sharing love and affection, and why should that be denied to
those who are gay?
''I came to the conclusion, when I was a teenager, that the practice
of homosexuality was wrong by taking notice of the scripture of Saint
Paul. Thirty years or so later, I came to the conclusion that this was a
misunderstanding.''

FOUR council workers were suspended yesterday after a load of
contaminated food went missing on route to a council incinerator at
Hillhouse in Hamilton.
Urgent warnings were sent out throughout Lanarkshire last night,
alerting the public not to eat any of the food because it would make
them ill.
A local baker had called in Hamilton District Council's environmental
health officers to destroy 500 puddings which had ''gone off''. But
police were alerted when a number of the defrosted sweets turned up for
sale at a nursing home for the elderly in the town.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said last night: ''We are investigating
the disappearance of a quantity of foodstuffs which was to be destroyed
by local health officers.
''We understand four environmental health workers have been suspended
pending our inquiries.''
The puddings included raspberry pavlovas, blackcurrent cheesecake, and
strawberry gateaux -- all normally sold in a frozen condition.

The Bill -- which will make information about foreign abortion

The Government's win had been expected despite a decision by the main

in order to conform with new community care guidelines.
The foundation running the Renfrewshire hospital, which has been
forced to apply for registration as a nursing home to qualify for
central and local government support, announced yesterday it would be
phasing out its dormitory accommodation in favour of modern units more
in tune with changing policies on the care of the elderly and disabled.
The work will accelerate the hospital's continual upgrading of
facilities and is expected to start later this year, the hospital's
annual meeting was told yesterday.
Details of the work were not available, but the hospital's central
building, a listed mansion house, will not be seriously affected.
The appointment of Lieutenant General Sir John MacMillan as chairman,
succeeding Vice Admiral Sir Thomas Baird who has decided to step down
after nine years' service, was also endorsed.
Sir John was confident the hospital could fund the work from reserves,
currently standing at #25.7m.
However, he would not rule out the possibility of a public appeal for
assistance when the full details of the programme are finalised.
However, Sir Thomas sounded a warning note when he indicated he
thought the charity's financial strength would be ''severely tested'' by
the scheme.
The hospital currently needs to raise #1.9m a year to cover its
running costs and that is likely to rise as a result of the planned
work, treasurer Iain Grimmond predicted yesterday.
The hospital, which looks after 355 patients, received #5.6m in
ordinary income and spent #7.4m last year, leaving it with a deficit of
#1.8m before items such as legacies and donations were taken into
account.
Legacies were #500,000 down on 1993 at #3.1m, with donations down
#80,000 to #960,000. However, the charity raised #1.3m through the sale
of investments which, coupled with legacies and donations, left Erskine
#2.9m in surplus for 1994, a slight decrease on 1993.

AN announcement by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang about the creation of a
body to run the affairs of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs is thought to
be imminent -- but fears are growing that he may be planning to lay the
entire responsibility on local government.
One source on the loch told The Herald yesterday that the coded
Scottish Office messages were that Mr Lang would leave it to the new
local authorities to come forward with proposals. It could be at least
another two years before any governing body is in place.
Lovers of Loch Lomond in particular fear that the loch could lose out
in terms of resources just as years of effort to bring in regulations on
power boating are set to bear fruit.
A new set of by-laws aimed at improving water-borne safety and at
preserving the loch's rapidly-deteriorating environment are with the
Scottish Office, which hopes they will in place for summer.
Scottish Natural Heritage is also due to announce as part of the
package that it has set aside more than #300,000 to provide the Loch
Lomond Park Authority with a patrol boat and water-borne rangers.
The Hutchison Committee, which Mr Lang commissioned to report on
management and conservation issues, was precluded from recommending any
kind of board similar to a national park board which points Mr Lang
towards another local government solution.
The present authority, created from four local authorities bordering
the loch, is widely regarded as worthy, but lacking proper finance and
teeth. After reorganisation, responsibility will pass to three
authorities.
Its current geographical area covers about 170 square miles. Include
the Trossachs, and the park would jump to more than 600 square miles,
possibly taking the focus, and any resources, off Loch Lomond and its
problems at a vital time.
While the cases are not exactly parallel, Mr Lang's voluntary
principle solution to the management of the Cairngorms -- appointing a
chairman and letting him pull together the diverse and often
bitterly-opposed interests to work out solutions -- was met with almost
universal dissatisfaction.
Mrs Hannah Stirling, of the Friends of Loch Lomond, said yesterday:
''The body we already have is too fragmented, so we do not want another
of the same.t.''

EXCLUSIVE
A JUDGE last night dismissed an action to prevent publication of
newspaper articles today in a ruling of major significance for freedom
of information and freedom of the press.
The owners of a Lanarkshire nursing home -- the subject of a BBC
Scotland documentary tonight -- had applied for an interdict to prevent
Caledonian Newspapers and others from reporting the allegations in the
programme of ''appalling'' standards of care.
Lord Morton of Shuna ruled the freedom of information and freedom of
the press should be upheld as far as possible, and said he had to
protect press freedom and public interest.
He added that the pursuers -- husband and wife Raymond and Margaret
Baigent, of Orchard House Nursing Home, Crossford -- would still have
the remedy of damages if anything defamatory was said of them.
Ironically, today's story in The Herald raises questions over the
accuracy of the Frontline Scotland investigation into conditions at the
home, which included the BBC using hidden cameras and speaking to five
former nursing staff.
The Baigents' counsel, Mr Neil Davidson, had argued that if damage was
done to someone's reputation then money could not compensate adequately,
and that the remedy he sought would pre-empt that damage occurring in
the first place.
Mr Davidson also produced evidence from doctors, a health board, and
others that gave the home ''a clean bill of health''.
However, Lord Morton indicated he could not judge what was or was not
defamatory on the basis of the information before him. He questioned
whether people should be prevented from complaining about matters of
public interest and said he knew nothing about the merits of the
complaints.
Mr Bill Dunlop, counsel for The Herald, said the press required
freedom to investigate and to report. On the basis that pursuers did not
know what defenders were going to publish, they could not possibly claim
it was defamatory. Furthermore, the material would only be defamatory if
it were untrue.
The Herald, he said, had carried out its own research and the owners
of the home were given the opportunity to comment on the allegations. He
said that claims of victimisation by the home owners would also be
reported.
Interdict should not be a vehicle to gag the press, Mr Dunlop
continued. If defamation occurred, the home owners would be entitled to
seek damages. If the newspaper was not allowed to publish today, the
broadcast would go ahead and by tomorrow the story would be old hat.
Mr James Taylor, representing another publication, argued that the
press were being used as a ''stalking horse'' to test the case before
any action against the BBC was raised. He said the whole matter should
have been dealt with at once rather than raising a separate action
against the BBC today.
Lord Morton refused the interdict and awarded expenses against the
pursuers.
Mrs Gillian Wade, for The Herald's lawyers, Bannatyne, Kirkwood, and
France, said last night: ''This is a victory for press freedom.''

ELECTRICITY share prices continued to tumble yesterday as the
Government was accused of a #4000m ramp, misleading share buyers when it
knew consumer price reductions were in the offing.
Last night at Westminster and in the City, rumours were building up
that the institutions at home and abroad in countries such as Japan and
America were considering suing the Government for a false prospectus on
the electricity shares sale.
Ministers hotly denied the accusation and were yesterday pointing the
finger of blame for the debacle firmly in the direction of the
regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild.
Sir George Young, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ''We
would reject any such accusation very strongly. We discussed the
prospectus with the regulator last Friday and we put the issue to the
lawyers and the financial advisers and in the light of their advice we
decided to go ahead.''
Labour is accusing the Government of insider dealing over the #4000m
sell-off of National Power and PowerGen which came just before the
regulator was planning a new pricing regime for the electricity
companies.
Yesterday, part-paid shares in PowerGen fell a further 4p to 185[1/2]p
and National Power fell 2p to 174[1/2]p. Northern Electric, which on
Tuesday reluctantly recommended acceptance of a 1100p-a-share takeover
bid by Trafalgar House, lost 104p to 793p. ScottishPower fell 2p to 312p
while Hydro-Electric lost the same amount to 307p.
Shadow Trade Secretary Jack Cunningham told BBC Radio yesterday: ''I'm
in no doubt that the Government has to face the charge that it is guilty
of breaching the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993. It is quite
clear, because the Treasury's merchant bankers have admitted it, that
they knew of Professor Littlechild's intention to reconsider his pricing
controls -- and that comes under the heading of inside information in
the Act of Parliament.''
