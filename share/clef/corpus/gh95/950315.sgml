The normally xenophobic French fashion industry is in raptures over an
invasion force assembled this week -- the British are over in force, and
they're sweeping all before them. Francesca Fearon reports from Paris on
the impact of the snazziest shock troops in town. Galliano weaves a web
of mystery around an imaginary heroine who becomes his muse for the
season.
IN THE early eighties it was the Japanese designers who laid siege
toParis, sending the custodians of style into a spin with their radical,
nihilistic view of fashion. Japanese minimalism, origami-cutting
technique and a sombre colour palette have had a profound and lasting
impact on design in the world's fashion capital.
In the nineties, however, the Parisians are bowing to a new invasion,
the Brits -- like Napoleon at Waterloo, a threat they didn't take
seriously at first, but now perhaps grudgingly respect. When the
international fashion buyers and press descend on Paris twice a year (as
they have being doing this week) for the ready-to-wear collections, the
most coveted invitations are not just for Chanel and Jean-Paul Gaultier,
but a group of four British designers. John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood,
Rifat Ozbek and the group's latest addition, John Rocha, are the hottest
shows on their schedules.
In Britain they are considered at the peak of their profession. All
are former winners of the British Fashion Designer of the Year; Vivienne
Westwood has won it twice and John Galliano currently holds the title
for the second time. Yet the drawing power Paris has on the
international fashion cognoscenti has lured them across the Channel to
parade their collections on the French catwalks, where they are greeted
with acclaim.
Vivienne Westwood is venerated as one of the six most influential
designers of the century by Women's Wear Daily, the fashion bible. John
Galliano is hailed as a genius, a description with which even Karl
Lagerfeld, who is not in the habit of praising fellow designers, would
concur. When asked by British Vogue if he thought of Galliano as a
genius he said: ''Yes . . . but better not say it too often because it
can make a person lazy.'' In a French industry survey published last
week by Journal du Textil both were voted among the top three designers
on the Paris catwalk.
Westwood and Galliano, observers say, should have their own couture
houses, for their cutting and tailoring skills are firmly rooted in the
craftsmanship of the couturier's atelier. Indeed, rumours flew round
Paris during the couture collections last January that Galliano would
assume the mantle of creative director at Givenchy when Hubert de
Givenchy retires. After digesting the views of industry insiders
including the British press, the house is expected to make the
appointment official in the next month. Certainly his
exotically-tailored suits and devastating ball gowns, like Westwood's
provocative visions of femininity (corsets and padded derrieres), are
treated with reverence in the xenophobic world of Paris couture. And the
respect is mutual.
Rifat Ozbek and John Rocha are the modernists in the group. Ozbek,
backed by Aeffe (the company owned by Italian designer Alberta
Ferretti), originally took his collections to the Milan runway where
Katharine Hamnett now shows. Then three seasons ago he switched to Paris
and realised a long-held dream. John Rocha transferred to Paris last
season. From his base in Dublin it proved to be no more expensive than
showing in London, but wisdom persuaded him that Paris would reach a
larger audience. ''It was a commercial decision and received a good
response,'' says Rocha. ''Paris is the centre of fashion with more
customers from Europe and the Far East.'' Ozbek certainly admits it's
tougher, but the move was worth taking, judging by the growth of his
reputation in France.
Ozbek's collections are a heady blend of sculpted shapes in futuristic
fabrics with ethnic touches often inspired by his Turkish roots. For
spring he produced shiny fencing jackets and little dresses with sprigs
of floral embroidery. The ideas are sexy and witty with clothes made to
be mixed rather than matched. That collection made a feature of the
tyranny of the shoulder pad. The collection he unveils in Paris will
take padding further, using it to sculpt chiffon in a theme described as
''space princess with an ethnic twist''.
There is a rich textural feel to Rocha's collections in the way he
mixes traditional and modern materials like hand-painted velvets,
flannel, pearlised leather and a matt nylon. His ideas are often
inspired by Celtic imagery and draw on Ireland's innate tailoring
skills. His autumn collection, though, which is scheduled just before
Galliano's on Friday, focuses on his flair for creating tender
silhouettes from combinations of fragile fabrics and lush textures.
Galliano weaves a web of mystery around an imaginary heroine who
becomes his muse for the season. Westwood's muses, however, are
historical creatures with intellectual leanings much like the designer
herself. This season she promises to be the French cocotte Ninon de
L'Enclos, offering the designer a wealth of historical references for
her collection.

Chelsea 2, Club Brugge 0
(Aggregate: 2-1)
CHELSEA'S assault on the European Cup-winners' Cup continued last
night when they overcame a one-goal first leg deficit to oust Club
Brugge at Stamford Bridge.
Mark Stein's first goal in Europe conjured Chelsea's lifeline after
only 15 minutes, when Paul Furlong met a Craig Burley's free kick and
headed down for Stein to hook in from close range.
Chelsea had to do without Dennis Wise, top scorer John Spencer, keeper
Dmitri Kharine and Eddie Newton, while 37-year-old Graham Rix and the
36-year-old player-manager, Glenn Hoddle, propped up the bench.
But the players rose to the challenge with great determination and
after 37 minutes Furlong put them 2-0 ahead when he steered home a Stein
cross, his first goal of the year.

IT will be make or break for Alison Bowie and Helen Macfie at this
weekend's Abercorn Open in Edinburgh, writes Elspeth Burnside.
With the Scottish team for next month's European championships due to
be named next week, this is their last chance to influence manager Derek
Davidson's selection.
Scottish champion Claire Waddell and the world No.16, Senga Macfie,
have already secured their places through the grand prix rankings, but
the contenders for the two manager wildcards include Bowie, Helen
Macfie, Lisa McKenna, and Wendy Maitland, and the latter pair are not
competing in the Abercorn event.
For Helen, the desperation to retain her place in the Scottish team
has led to her withdrawing from this weekend's British Open qualifying
event in Cardiff.
''The British Open is important and it could help my world ranking,
but it's more important for me to get into the Scottish team,'' she
explained.
Bowie, Scotland's most capped player with 95 appearances, has only
recently returned to top-class competition following the birth of her
daughter, Robyn, six months ago.
But she already has been given the nod that she will be in the
Amsterdam line-up and, this weekend, only requires to prove she is on
course to be fully fit by the end of next month.

WHATEVER the outcome of Saturday's Grand Slam showdown, Scotland will
emerge stronger for future challenges -- and for the World Cup --
according to former British Lions coach, Jim Telfer, now the SRU's
director of rugby.
''Confidence is high, which is a credit to team management and the
players. We've had a great year so far, and must remember it's been
achieved even with very good players like Armstrong, Nicol, Reed, and
Sharp absent through injury.
''Wales have not been able to handle injury problems this season, and
I think England have been extraordinarily fortunate not to have had any.
''There are a lot of things going right at the moment, but also a few
things wrong, like the way we are still leaking tries. Six in the last
three games is not acceptable. England rightly are the favourites, and
could give us a big shock. But even if we lose, I'm confident we will
learn a lot from Twickenham that will have huge benefits.''
Telfer's role in Scotland's magnificent revival should not be
under-estimated, but he is also in a unique position to assess the
reasons behind a transformation that has seen Gavin Hastings' side
suddenly produce four successive victories in 1995 to follow nine games
without a win in in 1993-94.
''It's difficult to pinpoint any exact reason as being responsible for
the turnaround,'' said Telfer.
Telfer points to individual fitness programmes initiated under David
McLean started last July and aimed specifically at getting Scotland's
squad physically prepared for altitude during the World Cup in South
Africa. He mentions psychologist Dr Richard Cox's work and says Scotland
were lucky to have the friendly against Canada on January 21 to provide
them with the perfect warm-up ahead of the Five Nations' Championship.
But Telfer reserves most of his praise for the Scottish selectors,
willingness of Scotland's management to redefine playing style, and
certain senior players' ability to re-assess their contributions.
He said: ''After our heavy defeat by South Africa last November, the
selectors took the brave decision to drop most of the team. I think 11
changes were made but it could have been 15.
Telfer believes the promotion of A team players like Eric Peters,
Stewart Campbell and Dave Hilton came at the right time to provide the
national side with new belief and forward impetus. He added: ''Our A
team was successful even though the senior side was going through a bad
time.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
THE UN peacekeeping chief left Sarajevo empty-handed today after two
days of urgent talks to try to shore up Bosnia's tattered ceasefire.
Special envoy Yasushi Akashi gloomily predicted a return to war if no
diplomatic breakthrough comes soon.
Akashi flew into Sarajevo on Sunday hoping to reinforce Bosnia's
10-week-old ceasefire, which has begun to unravel in the absence of
talks on a Serb-Muslim settlement to silence the guns for good.
A Serb machinegunner blew a hole in Akashi's plane even as he arrived
-- the first of many signs the Japanese diplomat saw to confirm Bosnia's
slide back towards full-blown war.
''The situation is serious and I would even say critical,'' he said
before boarding a flight back to UN Protection Force headquarters in
Zagreb.
''Unless we do something in the next two to three weeks, a further
degradation and resumption of fighting is feared.''
The ceasefire formally expires on May 1.
Akashi visited Serb leaders yesterday in Pale, outside Sarajevo, and
later said each side was accusing the other of bad faith in the
resurgence of hostilities across Bosnia.
However the gulf between the two sides goes much deeper. The Bosnian
Government rules out extending the truce unless the Serbs agree to the
international peace plan for Bosnia drafted last summer.
The Serbs have repeatedly rejected the plan's roughly even division of
Bosnia, which would require them to give up about one-third of the 70%
of the country now in their grip.
In Croatia, debate heated up today over the viability of a deal
designed to overcome Croatian demands for the UN to get out by
fulfilling Zagreb's call for international supervision of borders now
controlled by rebel Serbs.
Fears of a return to war there were defused on Sunday when Zagreb
backed down from plans to expel 12,000 UN peacekeepers.
In return the United States promised that it would press for
international controls of Croatia's borders to help it regain control
over the Serb-held Krajina enclave.
The Croatian press hailed this as a political coup for President
Franjo Tudjman, but diplomats and UN officials today wondered whether a
shake-up in deploying blue berets would isolate the rebel Serbs from
sources of arms, which Croatia says must be a priority of the redesigned
UN mission.
* Nine French peacekeepers were killed today and four more injured in
the worst accident to hit the UN mission in Yugoslavia since it began in
1992.
An army official in Paris said the soldiers' vehicle appeared to have
slipped on ice on a road near Mount Igman, near Sarajevo, and the
occupants were thrown to their deaths 160ft below.--Reuter.

DUNDEE United parted company with Ivan Golac yesterday and then told
Gordon Wallace, Paul Hegarty, and Maurice Malpas to put their heads
together to relieve the club's anxiety induced by the threat of
relegation. The club's chairman Jim McLean, however, may have another
another problem as he looks around for a successor to the Croat.
Other than McLean's brother Tommy -- ''but he has a contract and it
would be wrong to talk of our Tommy in connection with a job here,'' the
chairman said -- the obvious candidate is Jimmy Nicholl, who has an
agreement with his club, Raith Rovers, that he can move to a bigger club
if one comes calling. United are a larger club, but so, too, are
Aberdeen and it is likely Nicholl is at the top of their wanted list.
Both Aberdeen and United have hinted that their caretaker teams -- the
Pittodrie side are relying on Roy Aitken to lead them from the
wilderness -- would be offered more permanent positions if results and
performances show a dramatic improvement, but it would be a surprise if
both clubs have not already been casting envious glances towards
Kirkcaldy, where Nicholl has been excelling.
It was not so long ago in conversation that Clyde's manager Alex
Smith, whose views are widely respected, spoke in glowing terms about
Nicholl. ''He is a young manager who has already gained some valuable
experience and he is the one man a board of directors could expect to
walk into their club and give the place an immediate lift,'' Smith said.
''He has a manner about him and a relaxed way of going about the job
which obviously appeals to players.''
It is natural the youngest of the three McLean brothers (like the
United chairman, Willie's managerial days are behind him) will drift
into conversation about Golac's successor, but the Tannadice club's
board were insisting yesterday that nothing has been decided and that
the matter of a possible replacement manager has not been discussed.
''We are leaving our options open,'' McLean stressed, ''and we have made
no promises to the people who will see us through to the end of the
season.
''Unfortunately, results now are more important than the performances,
when normally I would say both these things were of equal
significance.''
McLean added money would be made available if Wallace wants to
strengthen the squad.
The chairman and some members of his board met with Golac early
yesterday morning and a ''mutual'' agreement was concluded with United
saying the manager was not sacked and that they merely decided not to
renew his contract. Golac's deal would have expired on June 30 in any
case and there was a three-month notice option on either side.
Although McLean also insisted that Sunday's defeat by Hearts in the
Tennents Scottish Cup should not be considered the reason for a parting
of the ways, it would be naive to ignore the possibility that the 2-1
loss at Tynecastle was not the final straw. The possibility of repeating
last season's triumph, when United beat Rangers in the final, was all
that was keeping Golac in place.
United's league form has been erratic and McLean and his directors had
been growing increasingly concerned about the downward spiral. ''Our
poor league performances over the last two seasons and exits from
European and domestic cup competitions this season have been a major
disappointment for the club and its supporters,'' McLean said.
''Therefore the board have decided that it is in the best interests of
everyone associated with Dundee United that the position is made clear
now both to preserve our premier league status and to prepare for next
season.''
Clearly McLean, who said at the turn of the year that Golac would have
to prove himself to be professional in all aspects of management before
his contract would be renewed, felt the former Partizan Belgrade manager
had not improved enough, although McLean would not be drawn on that.
Golac, of course, took United to their first Scottish Cup triumph, but
results in the premier division have not been good enough and McLean
asked: ''Do we look at the cup and say we were successful or do we look
at the league and say maybe we weren't?''
While McLean, flanked by vice-chairman Doug Smith and his temporary
management team, spoke, Golac was at home sipping wine with some
journalists and flicking through travel brochures. He had promised
himself a holiday and now he has all the time in the world in which to
indulge himself and his family, although he will find employment
somewhere when he is ready.
He will spend time with friends in Southampton -- he played at the
Dell for many seasons -- after his holiday and then return to Belgrade,
a city relatively untouched by the troubles and where he has family and
some property. In fact, his mother in law is in poor health and his
family would want to be closer to her.
''I wish everyone well and I hope the players do well for
themselves,'' he said before closing another chapter of his life.

THE International Rugby Football Board has been unable to agree a
world-wide consensus on the issue of professionalism, and a binding
decision on if, how, and when the players can be paid has been deferred
until August.
However, the board has now acknowledged that ''shamateurism'' is
bringing the game into disrepute, and has said that unless immediate
steps are taken to ease the pressures on the amount of time top players
devote to the game -- such as the introduction of a binding seven-month
season -- then the natural progression will be towards a professional
game.
The issue of player-payments, which threatens to cause a rift between
the Northern and Southern Hemisphere Unions, has been the subject of a
four-man IB working party investigation headed by chairman Vernon Pugh
of Wales, and including Scottish Rugby Union representative Freddie
McLeod.
The party's report, which -- as revealed in The Herald six weeks ago
-- has identified global abuses of the amateursism regulations, was
presented to the IB annual general meeting in Bristol.
Yesterday the board announced that the working party report would now
be circulated to all member unions, and that they would have two months
to respond before a specially convened meeting in Paris, to be held from
August 24-26.
Pugh said: ''Full and frank discussions have taken place, outlining
the ambiguities and the difficulties of achieving conformity within the
current regulations, as well as defining a way forward to accommodate
the pressures within the modern game.''
He declared that the game's administrators would now have to indicate
what kind of game they wanted.
''It is such an important issue, in terms of the ethos of the game,
that we have to get it right. We have to set in place regulations which
everybody can live with.''
The board is hoping that, after the August meeting in Paris, such a
degree of consensus will have been reached that the task of policing
whatever new amateurism regulations are decided upon will be easier than
that existing at present.
Scottish IB representative Freddie McLeod said later that, in the
course of the working party inquiry, it had been discovered that every
amateurism regulation was being broken somewhere in the world.
''Very few unions have, as yet, identified where they want to be on
the issue of amateurism. The fact that they now have two months in which
to respond will help to concentrate the minds.
''The SRU position is that while we are determined that the game
should remain amateur, and that players should not be paid for playing,
there should be more liberal interpretation of what players can earn for
off-field activities.
''We are also setting up a player career development programme which
will look at what happens to an international player when he retires
from the game at the age of 31 or 32.''
Players in Scotland, like many other top nations, benefit from a trust
fund administered by the SRU and players' representatives. The amount of
money in the fund is substantial, the sponsorship cash from the team
sponsor, Famous Grouse, amounting to some #100,000 this year.
The specific nature of the problem facing the legislators was outlined
by McLeod. ''David Campese of Australia has gone on record as saying
that whatever regulations we write, the players will find a way around
them. Against that frame of mind, what are we supposed to do?''
Other main points decided by the IB at its annual general meeting
were:
* RUGBY League defectors can return to Rugby Union, to play and
referee, after a period of three years, but only below national
representative level.
* THE residency qualification recommendation which allows an
individual to qualify for a national side has been increased from 12 to
36 months.
* BELOW international level, clubs will now be able to display three
advertisers' logos on jerseys.
* The personal and communication allowance for international players
has been increased from #22 per day to #25. Compensation for financial
disadvantage is up from #40 to #45 per day.
* A schedule of disciplinary sanctions for foul play has been
introduced ranging from 30 days' suspension for punching, 60 days for
kicking and head-butting to 120 days for abuse of a match official.
* IF a front-row player is sent off for foul play and no other player
is capable of filling that role, then another forward can leave the
field to be replaced by a front-row substitute.

Partick Thistle 0, Motherwell 0
THISTLE snuggled up a little closer to the rest of the premier
division with a hard-earned point at muddy Firhill last night, to
maintain their fine recent run which has brought them only one defeat in
seven games.
There were moments when Motherwell who stretched their advantage in
second-top place to three points, looked a more poised and talented
side, but, equally, the Jags had at least as good, if not better scoring
chances.
Thistle are now one point behind Aberdeen with a game in hand, the
home match with Hearts, and will face the struggle to come with even
greater desire.
Things had gone along in fairly routine style (if that is ever the
case at Firhill) when referee Andrew Waddell made two decisions which
livened up the action.
It appeared to me that he was wrong on both occasions, first when he
ignored a sound claim for a Thistle penalty when a Kevin McKee cross
seemed to be handled by Eddie May; and, secondly, when he gave a foul
against Miodrag Krivokapic which so incensed Motherwell manager Alex
McLeish.
Before that Motherwell had seemed comfortable enough, playing
reasonable football on the sodden pitch, and they might have gone ahead
when Alex Burns, released by a superb Billy Davies pass, shot for goal
only to see Nicky Walker make a fine diving save.
Just before the interval, Thistle were genuinely unlucky not to score
when a Welsh header from Ian Cameron's corner was cleared off the line
by Paul Lambert and then Woods managed to block the return shot from
Turner.
Thistle replaced Wayne Foster with Rod McDonald at the start of the
second half and they came close to scoring when Woods could only parry a
Roddy Grant shot and McDonald was off target with the follow-up.
By now Partick had warmed to the task and for a spell gave Motherwell
more bother than at any stage in the first half, including a threatening
cross by Turner which Woods touched over the bar.
Considering all the energy being expended, it was maybe due to the
players' credit that the first booking came in 76 minutes, Pittman for a
foul on Davies.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, McKee, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, Turner,
Grant, Craig, Foster, Cameron, McWilliams. Substitutes -- Smith,
McDonald, Cairns.
MOTHERWELL -- Woods, May, McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Burns, Arnott, Davies. Substitutes -- Roodie, Philliben,
Howie.
Referee -- A W Waddell (Edinburgh).

Chelsea 2, Club Brugge 0
(Aggregate: 2-1)
CHELSEA defender Erland Johnsen was criticised as Glenn Hoddle's men
clinched their place in the European Cup-winners' Cup semi-finals with a
2-0 win over Brugge.
The big Norwegian collided with Belgian goalkeeper Dany Verlinden, who
needed stitches in his knee. Brugge manager Hugo Broos said: ''It was a
bad foul and he should have been given the red card. That was not
football, it was trying to kill someone.''
But after Chelsea retrieved a 1-0 first-leg deficit, he added: ''I
don't think it would have changed the match.''
Chelsea's scorers were Mark Stein, scoring on his Euro debut, and the
much criticised Paul Furlong, who grabbed a second before the break.
The jailing on Monday of Dennis Wise was one of Chelsea's inspirations
and Hoddle said: ''The spotlight was on the club.''

AFTER missing out on all five of yesterday's individual championship
finals Scotland's bowlers will be looking for a fifth successive win in
the Home International championship when they launch their title defence
tonight against Ireland, writes Gordon Dunwoodie.
The Scots were reduced yesterday to the role of spectators as they saw
England claim three titles and Wales two. Pride of place went to
Norfolk's Mervyn King, who survived a 29-end marathon before a last end
double gave him a 21-20 win over Wales' John Price.
England's other two titles came in the pairs and fours -- and gave
Gary Smith a unique double. In the morning he lined up as third in the
rink skipped by world indoor singles champion Andy Thomson along with
his Cipher's clubmates, Martin Sekjer and Terry Heppell, and claimed the
title for a record fourth time when they beat David Hamilton's Belfast
rink 21-17.
Smith then joined up with Brian Vickers to take the pairs with a 16-13
win over Ireland's Mervyn Beattie and Stan Espie.
Wales' two titles came in the junior singles and triples. In the
singles Nick Jones added the British junior indoor title to his outdoor
success last summer when he edged out Belfast's Jonathan Ross 21-20, and
in the triples Wales beat Ireland 16-12.

DUNCAN Ferguson has failed in his bid to overturn his sending-off
against Leicester 10 days ago and earn a reprieve for the FA Cup
semi-final against Tottenham.
Everton appealed against the dismissal, but referee Phil Durkin
reviewed a video recording of the incident and decided he saw nothing to
make him change his opinion that Ferguson led with his elbow and
committed a serious foul.
Ferguson, dismissed for the second time since his signing from
Rangers, now faces a four-match suspension.

WE all knew it would happen. Ivan Golac smiled once too often and
suffered the punishment that goes with the inherent Calvinistic mores
that prevail in Scottish football. Laugh when you win, rant and rave
when you lose, or else.
Golac has known for many months that he would be shown the door but he
harboured the ambition to win the Scottish Cup again and then offer a
victory salute, or something that looked like it, as he headed for
pastures new.
That hope died with the defeat by Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday,
after which everybody, including the man himself, knew what would happen
and, if Dundee United's actions yesterday seemed to be taken with almost
indecent haste, maybe it is better that way.
Golac will not weep many tears. ''You know me. I'll always be happy,''
he told me a couple of months ago when I asked him how he would react if
the sacking did come one day. ''I will bounce back. I always do.''
However, maybe there should be some tears shed in this country as one
of the more refreshing characters in the business takes his leave.
United showed immense courage and enterprise in appointing a foreigner
in the first place. Many people hoped that this would initiate a new
style of playing, a more continental approach and a less introverted
demeanour among the team leaders in the Scottish game.
It is a pity, therefore, that United could not hang on to the courage
of their convictions. They gave the Croatian fewer than two seasons to
get it right. Did he fail? Many would find it hard to say that he did.
The team won the Scottish Cup for the first time in their history in
his first season in this country, during which they finished sixth in
the premier division.
This term, which was always likely to be an anti-climax after that
heady success at Hampden, they went out of the cup at the quarter-final
stage, were a huge letdown in Europe, and are among the strugglers in
the lower reaches of the league.
Yet, there have been new players, like Gordan Petric and Sergio, who
have offered promise of good things to come and the manager, in typical
fashion, remained as positive as ever despite the cup exit.
In fact, he railed against pressmen asking him about the battle to
beat relegation. ''This is what disappoints me in this country. People
are so negative. We are six points away from third place in the table
but you ask me about relegation.''
That was very much a kernel of his philosophy. He believed that if the
manager talked about relegation, the players would start to think about
it and a kind of collective kamikaze pact would be sealed.
From the start of his managerial career here, following a successful
time with his old club, Partizan Belgrade, Golac, who was pipped to the
Celtic post by Liam Brady, produced the outrageous tongue-in-cheek
pronouncements which upset the style long since estabished among his
peers in Britain.
The former Southampton player loved to startle his listeners with
predictions of cup wins, championship successes, and defeats for all and
sundry. Half the time he did it for fun and would have a rare old
chuckle if it worked, as it did when his team won the cup.
United's players, used to an entirely different style of management
from Jim McLean, took time to get to grips with the modus operandi of
the laid-back, sybaritic new man who was not averse to taking them a
walk to let them relax and enjoy the countryside.
He told me recently that other managers in this country have said to
him privately that they wished they could speak out as he did, but the
fact that they felt obliged to conform maybe should have been a sign to
Golac that there is only one door through which eccentrics,
individualists, and anyone else who tries to buck the system will be
despatched in this country.
His dismissal might well be worth noting carefully in the managerial
offices of the four teams bidding to win the cup this year. It may not
be a brilliant idea to win it.
Alex Smith did for St Mirren and was sent packing the following
season. He also did it for Aberdeen and went out the door less than two
seasons later. Now Golac has been sent the same route. Without wishing
to spoil your breakfast, gentlemen, you have been warned.

<HEADLINE>Dismissal is not the end, recounts Bruce Rioch Cup final life better second time round Picture: CHRIS GLEAVE</HEADLINE>

TIME, mused Bruce Rioch yesterday, is the great healer in football. It
has to be, stressed the Bolton Wanderers manager, because there is
really no hiding place in the game.
That may be some consolation to Ivan Golac this morning after his
departure from Dundee United yesterday.
Right now Rioch is heading for Wembley with Bolton, but his past has
been studded with disappointments even more traumatic than the events at
Tannadice yesterday.
It was Rioch, remember, who captained Scotland in Argentina in the
World Cup finals in 1978, an expedition which turned into a debacle for
the national team and a disaster for the national psyche.
It was Rioch who guided Middlesbrough to a cup final after taking them
through the trauma of bankruptcy only to find himself sacked 10 days
before what was then the biggest match of his managerial career.
Now though, happily in charge at Burnden Park, Rioch can look back
without too much anger on these events.
He is clearly a man who has decided not to carry with him the excess
baggage of bitterness, and he smiled: ''Last week on March 8 we beat
Swindon to qualify for the Coca-Cola Cup final. It was the same date I
was sacked by Middlesborough. After our win I got a telegram of
congratulations from the chairman who had fired me.
''That is how it has to be in football. It's a small world and you
continually bump into the same people. You cannot go on and on carrying
grudges.''
Rioch never played for his country again after Argentina. Now he
remembers the one incident which still causes him a degree of anger.
His wife and his father had driven to London to meet him when he
arrived back at Gatwick with the squad. During an impromptu press
conference one reporter asked him -- ''Are your family too ashamed to be
here?''
Even now, at that memory, a cloud crosses Rioch's face. ''I can't
forget that,'' he said. ''The guy didn't realise my father and wife were
standing there close by. It showed me just how unkind, how unthinking
people can be.
''I saw my father put down my suitcase and I knew I had to get him
away. He would have killed that guy.''
Now, of course, things are so much better for the 47-year-old who has
still not allowed the cares of management to bring even one grey hair to
his head.
Bolton are a club with a long and distinguished history -- now they
also have a future.
First there is Wembley and the final against Liverpool. Then there is
the possibility of promotion to the Premiership.
Rioch's managerial skills have propelled them towards that twin goal.
No-one in the Lancashire town thinks anything other than that.
He plays his role down. He tells you that the game is about players,
that it's the members of the team who contribute 90% towards any
successes.
He quotes Bill Shankly: ''A club is only as good as the players it
has. They can have the best administrators, and the best commercial
department, but without players they'll have nothing.'' Rioch believes
that.
Rioch has a reputation as a disciplinarian, but that is something he
would argue with. He believes that his public image sometimes gets mixed
up with that of his regular soldier father. ''People think about me and
confuse me with regimental sergeant major James Rioch,'' he said, ''but
that is not the case.
''I do insist on punctuality. That is very important for me because if
two players are late then we can't work with the team and everyone
suffers. But if players want to come to training in jeans, or track
suits and even unshaven then that's okay.
''I did have a lot of guidelines when I was manager at Middlesbrough.
But they were young players there who had to come through all the
problems of the club going broke. It's different here because I'm
dealing with senior players.''
Rioch reckons that his team have done themselves no favours by beating
Liverpool in a pre-season match at Burnden Park last summer. He pointed
out: ''I think that result made Roy Evans decide to change things. It
was then he made up his mind to shift some players out and to bring
others in and they have gone from strength to strength since then.
''I just hope that we can still surprise them, but I know that
Liverpool are the bench mark for all of us. They have had people at the
club like Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny, Ronnie Moran, and
now Roy Evans.
''They have set standards for every one of us. They have set standards
in behaviour and in the way they have played the game. That is what we
will be up against.''
As for promotion, that will come later. He stressed: ''Last year we
suffered a little because we had such good cup results. The players were
on a high. We couldn't bring them down and somehow the results in the
league began to disappoint. Now, though, they are more experienced.''
Bolton have been in the top division only twice in the last 30 years.
Rioch believes that the club have lost a generation of supporters and
these are the people he is trying to woo back through the turnstiles.
He said: ''I want to put a smile back on all their faces. I want my
team to entertain. If we do that and we win then we will get the support
back to the games. We have doubled the attendance figures. When I
arrived here with my assisant Colin Todd the attendances were around
6000. Now we are getting closer to 13,000 and we'll sell all the tickets
we get for Wembley.''

THEY still talk about the 1987 Festival at Cheltenham. The running of
the Gold Cup was delayed for more than an hour as a blizzard swept the
Prestbury Park course.
Earlier in the day, some spectators, anxious to obtain a bird's eye
view of the track, had climbed on to the roof of a grandstand, which
promptly collapsed under their weight. Ten were taken to hospital.
At almost precisely the moment that they fell so did Charlie Swan, now
the finest National Hunt jockey in all Ireland, then a raw youngster
making his debut at the meeting.
''I was, ironically, riding a horse called Irish Dream,'' he recalled.
''At the last he tipped me out, landed on my arm, which was broken,
while another faller kicked me in the face.
''There were no available ambulances because of the roof accident, so
they put me into a minibus used for transporting elderly people. No
sooner had we set off for the hospital than it drove straight into a
passing car. Despite that I have loved Cheltenham since the first moment
I set eyes on it.'' And so have we all.
Here we are, back again for the Olympics of NH racing, the greatest
jump meeting in the world. The horses are all trying, the jockeys are
all brave. They guide more than half-a-ton of horseflesh over fearsome
obstacles and most of them have had little more than a glass of water
and a slice of toast for breakfast. Imagine asking Damon Hill to drive
in a grand prix after he had been wasting for weeks to lose weight.
The Festival statisticians, and they are legion, inform me that the
gathered throng will consume four tons of sirloin beef, one-and-half
tons of salmon, 3500 gallons of champagne, 25,000 bottles of wine,
150,000 bottles of beer and, in St Patrick's week, 20,000 gallons of
Guinness. That's just on the course, mind you.
This is the week for the punt in two senses of the word. Last year, a
friend introduced me to a quiet-spoken, thin chap with a shock of dark
hair. ''Do you know JP,'' I was asked.
Something stopped me from replying ''JP who?'' but I hadn't really the
faintest idea who he was. It was JP McManus, the lad from Limerick, now
living in Geneva, known affectionately as ''The Sundance Kid'' and by
less admiring epithets by some bookmakers.
In 1994, JP put #30,000 on his own horse, Gimme Five, in an attempt to
win #250,000. He failed.
Undaunted, the following day he laid #110,000 on Danoli, and his
pockets were refilled with just more than #215,000.
Cheltenham is bung full of Irish eccentrics, one once drove here from
London on a motorised lawnmower -- for a bet -- another breezed in on a
Penny Farthing. Carpet dealer Noel Furlong had to pay off a #250,000 VAT
debt to the British authorities before they would even let him into the
country. He soon had his own back -- he won #2m by backing his own
horse.
It is doubtful if there are more priests in the Vatican than in the
Cotswolds this week. There are 20 races in the Festival and about #1m
will be wagered on each of them at the course. Don't believe it when
they tell you only the captains of privatised utilities have cash to
spare.
Nor is it all about the Irish. The is the Queen Mother's favourite
event. She may be too frail to be here this year, but trainers and
jockeys will be chatting to her on her private line.
Racing was always reckoned to be the sport of kings, and it was George
the Third who made Cheltenham a fashionable inland resort. Anyone who
was anyone came here, still does.
Not everyone likes racing, however. Preachers fulminated against
gambling and, in 1829, protesters disrupted the meeting by throwing
stones at the horses. The following year they burned down the stand.
Only punters' fingers are likely to be singed this week.
Do I have any tips for the remainder of the Festival? Do they have the
odd shower in Manchester? I will be backing Harcon in the Sun Alliance,
Red Blazer in today's bumper, Elegant Lord in the Foxhunters' Chase
tomorrow, and Minnehoma in the Gold Cup.
And, if Scottish trainer Tom Dyer's Chief Minister wins the Coral Cup
this afternoon, I may never reach Twickenham in time.

THE movement of young professional people and families back into the
city to live looks set to continue, especially as more and more suitable
housing becomes available.
Miller Homes' exclusive development at College Lands has taken account
of what so many different people are looking for in terms of new homes
and have managed to incorporate a wide range of house types with varying
specifications, designed to meet individual needs.
''We recognise that families come in all shapes and sizes,'' explained
Irene Glassey, sales manager at Miller Homes. ''That's why we build
homes to suit everyone including individuals and independent couples who
appreciate the convenience of modern living.''
The development at College Lands, set in landscaped grounds around a
central courtyard, has been designed by a leading architect to
complement and enhance the environment. It is situated in an area that
has one of the most successful mix of old and new buildings in the city,
and the development itself is a fine example of original buildings being
complemented by new ones.
There is a wide range of high quality one and two bedroom apartments
and for those who are looking for something even more exclusive, there
are two four apartment penthouses. With each property having its own
allocated parking space, the problem of parking in the city centre is
immediately solved.
Miller Homes has consulted with a wide range of people to find out
what they are looking for in a new home, and this has resulted in a
range of house types that meets these changing needs and aspirations.
They found that homebuyers today are looking for more storage spaces
in their homes, energy efficiency, security, and generally convenient
homes in pleasant surroundings, and of course, a quality product at the
right price.
Said Irene Glassey: ''Our commitment to build quality hasn't changed
in over fifty years and our craftsmen still build to traditional
standards. We believe that people still appreciate the thought and
attention to detail that goes into both the planning and the
construction of our developments.''
Standard specifications at College Lands include electric central
heating, double glazing, fully fitted kitchens complete with electric
appliances, fitted bathrooms with electric showers, fitted wardrobes,
and a host of features that give quality finishing touches to the flats.
Security entry systems and smoke detectors, together with strong and
secure external doors and window locks are all standard.
The communal areas are served by passenger lifts and refuse chutes,
with carpets on the main corridors and landings.
Prices for the one and two bedroom flats at College Lands are #66,000
and #54,000, and there are six different styles from which to choose.
A new two bedroom ground floor showflat was opened a few weeks ago,
and has been proving very popular.
On of its attractions must be the unusual layout, with all of the
apartments leading off an ''L' shaped hall, and the three-windowed
turret-shaped alcove area -- ideal for a dining table and chairs -- in
the lounge. As with all of the homes at College Lands, another
attraction is generous cupboard space.
College Lands is also well placed for the city's shopping,
entertainments and road links.
The showflat is open from Friday to Tuesday inclusively, from 11am
until 6pm. Telephone: 0141 552 1406.

TWO of the kings who touched down at Prestwick have left their mark on
the Ayrshire town.
In the thirteenth century, King Robert I, burning up with an agonising
skin disease, struck at the ground with his lance and soothing water
gushed from the ground. Today, Bruce's Well, in need of a wash and brush
up, it has to be said, commemorates the event.
On March 2, 1960, another king arrived. The only British soil Elvis
Presley ever trod was at Prestwick, when the DC-7 taking him home from
Germany made a fuel stop. This momentous occasion is marked by the
Graceland Bar at the International Airport.
Prestwick's long-established airport has had a big impact on the local
job and property market. Apart from the airport itself, Aviall
Caledonian Engine Services and Jetstream Aircraft Ltd are big employers,
attracting relocating incomers.
The town is 30 miles from Glasgow by road, and the M77 extension will
undoubtedly boost the local economy. There are trains to Glasgow Central
every half hour, with the trip taking around 40 minutes. There is also a
new link to the airport.
Retired people are also attracted to the friendly town and most local
people would never dream of leaving.
Janette Morrison, sales negotiator at Countrywide, says: 'Many
shopkeepers know you by name and will stop to chat. Ayr is only four
miles away, yet worlds apart in terms of getting to know people.
Prestwick is small-scale and you can easily walk to the shops.'
Countrywide is currently marketing a two-storey, two-bedroom flat at
above the shops in Main Street at A42,000.
For a small place, Prestwick has a surprising variety of good value
property, with one-bedroom flats from A30,000 to traditional four
bedroom properties from A150,000. The market is generally active with
bungalows popular around the town and in particular at Adamton Road, St
Quivox Road and Pladda Drive. Traditional properties are mainly red
sandstone and there are typical examples at St Ninians Road and the
seafront.
Irene McWhirter, receptionist at agents Nicoll Design and a resident
for 15 years, says: 'The seafront is sought after by incoming buyers,
but many locals prefer the other side of town, up from the Main Street.
'One of the most select areas is around Bellevue Road, with its
individual detached properties such as The Gables, some of which are
home to local business people. These houses seldom come on to the market
unless someone dies.' Prestwick has a good choice of new-build by Wimpey
(Charter Hall, Station Drive and lately Kings Meadow terraced, semis and
bungalows from A42,995); by Ambion at Moor Park - three and four-bedroom
semis and detached villas, A54,990 to A84,490, off East Road; by Barratt
Pennycrest Park; by Dawn Construction luxury flats at Monkton Court,
near the airport (two are for sale, o/o A48,950 or A77,500 fixed,
through Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison); and smaller developments like the
luxury villas at Maryborough Road.
Some of the new developments off East Road are outwith walking
distance of the shopping in Main Street.
Peter Gillespie, regional manager at SEAL, says: 'Prestwick is an
improving town, with many local amenities and a wealth of facilities on
your doorstep at Troon and Irvine.'
Prestwick has three championship golfcourses St Nicholas, St Cuthberts
and Old Prestwick. Prestwick held the first dozen Opens in the
nineteenth century.
The town is also famous for its outdoor and indoor bowling champions.
Other facilities are a swimming pool, running track, tennis courts and
football pitch at St Ninians Park, and a sailing club. Schooling is
good, with Prestwick Academy highly respected.
Shopping is based on local trades and the large multiples can be found
nearby at Ayr. There are plenty of places to eat out and the Taj Indian
restaurant is something of a landmark. The seafront has superb views to
Arran, which attract Sunday promenaders even in winter.
In the summer it is an altogether livelier place, attracting B&amp;B
tourists and day-trippers to the amusement arcades and go-karting. The
esplanade is undergoing improvements with inventive paving, seating and
the cheery seal sculpture playpark.
It may be some time before the beach passes the EU clean water
regulations. There is a lot of pressure on the local sewage works as the
town grows. A proposed improved sewage works at Ayr would help.
Anyone following in the footsteps of King Robert or Elvis will not
fail to be impressed by the friendly good spirits of the locals.
Mrs Reid, sales negotiator at Goodfellow, would never consider moving.
She says: 'The town may have smaller shops and less nightlife than Ayr,
and the sailing club is not as grand as the Troon Marina, but house
prices are cheaper and I really enjoy the small community.'

CLIFF 'The Grinder' Thorburn produced a flash of his old brilliance to
beat Steve Davis 5-2 in the last 16 of the Kloster Thailand Open in
Bangkok.
Thorburn, the 1980 world champion, had won only three of his previous
15 matches against Davis, the last of them four years ago. But there was
no semblance of a fluke yesterday. ''I felt I had a chance of winning if
I could control the game -- and that's what happened,'' he said.
Mark Johnston-Allen continued his run by beating David Roe 5-3, and
James Wattana won the last three frames to beat Willie Thorne 5-4.

Dumbarton 5, Stenhousemuir 1
DUMBARTON had a glory night with magnificent performances from hat
trick hero Hugh Ward and midfielder Martin Mooney which saw leaders Sons
extend their unbeaten league run to 10 games.
After seven minutes, Mooney's speculative lob deceived keeper
Harkness, and Stenhousemuir fell further behind after 27 minutes when
Hamilton sent Mooney clear on the right, and his cut back was netted by
Ward.
The Warriors threw themselves a lifeline just before the break when
Euan Donaldson fired home a great Fisher cross. But Sons struck again
through McKinnon after 53 minutes, followed four minutes later by Ward
with another cracking counter. Ten munutes from the end, Ward hot his
hat trick.

MORTON earned the points with an amazing four goal first-half burst
which had this promotion clash settled by the interval, with And
although Clyde battled gamely, the main threat to the Greenock side came
from the intermittent snow showers. midfielder Derek McInnes
outstanding.
After only five minutes a McInnes corner was headed almost out of the
hands of keeper Les Fridge and into the net by Derek Lilley. Then Lilley
added a second in 31 minutes from a cross from Marko Rajamaki.
Four minutes slater, McInnes got the third And almost on the interval,
Finnish striker Rajamaki headed a fourth.
Clyde were left with 10 men for the last 15 minutes when Ian Angus was
taken off with a leg injury, the two subs having been used. But five
minutes from time, John Dickson hit a consolation goal from the penalty
spot.

KARL-HEINZ Riedle fired a last-minute winner to sink former club
Lazio, and send Germany's Borussia Dortmund into the semi-finals of the
UEFA Cup last night.
The German international striker, signed by Dortmund for #4.5m in 1993
after three years with the Rome club, put the Bundesliga leaders through
2-1 on aggregate after clinching their 2-0 home win.
Dortmund, who lost 1-0 in Italy, levelled the tie after 11 minutes
when Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat coverted a penalty awarded when
Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani tripped Riedle.
However, Serie A leaders Juventus struck three times in the last 13
minutes to restore Italy's honour at the expense of Germany's Eintracht
Frankfurt. The teams were locked at 1-1 following the first leg in
Germany, and Italian international midfielder Antonio Conte opened the
scoring with a volley ater 77 minutes. Fabrizio Ravanelli hammered a
second nine minutes later, and Alessandro del Piero made it 3-0 in the
last minute.
Fellow Italian championship chasers Parma also moved into the
semi-finals after holding Odense to a 0-0 draw and putting an end to the
fairy-tale campaign of the Danish part-timers from Hans Christian
Andersen's hometown.
Parma, runners-up in last year's Cup Winners' Cup, guarded their 1-0
lead from the first leg with defensive tactics.
Bayer Leverkusen completed the last four line-up by becoming the
second German club to progress from the quarter-finals by holding French
League leaders Nantes to a goalless draw. Nantes had been swept aside
5-1 in the away leg.
Meanwhile, Franz Beckenbauer may doubt that Bayern Munich can win the
European Cup, but coach Giovanni Trapattoni is confident the German
champions will overcome Gothenburg in Sweden tonight and reach the
semi-finals.
Club president Beckenbauer, fuming over last weekend's 1-1 league draw
with Duisburg, said he could not recall seeing such a pathetic display
by Bayern. ''Anyone who thinks we can win the European Cup is
dreaming.''
Bayern were held to a goalless draw in their quarter-final first leg
in Munich by Gothenburg.

ALDERBROOK completed an incredible transformation from student to
graduate within a remarkable eight weeks yesterday to clinch the Smurfit
Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham.
In only his third start over obstacles, the six-year-old defied all
the experts to claim trainer Kim Bailey and jockey Norman Williamson's
first successes at the Festival.
He became only the third novice to win the coveted title -- matching
the feats of Doorknocker and Royal Gait -- by beating Large Action by
five lengths with Danoli third and Fortune And Fame fourth.
But with more than two years separating his first and second runs, he
is by far the least experienced to win the race.
Alderbrook, a Group winner on the Flat, was always travelling
supremely well for Williamson and, asked for his effort halfway up the
run-in, he quickly swept away from Large Action.
''What a way to break my duck,'' said Bailey. ''I have dreamt about
this for a long time.
''He is a remarkable horse. For him to get fit within eight weeks,
learn how to jump, and win a Champion Hurdle is unreal.''
Ireland's traditional raid on the Festival was given a spectacular
lift-off as they carried off the first two races with Tourist Attraction
and Klairon Davis.
Klairon Davis returned to the winner's enclosure to a tumultuous
reception from the huge Irish contingent after his victory in the
Guinness Arkle Challenge Trophy.
Irish stables had kicked off the meeting by supplying the winner,
second (Ventana Canyon), and fourth (Blazing Spectacle) in the Citroen
Supreme Novices' Hurdle.
Tourist Attraction (25-1) is in the care of Willie Mullins, whose
father, Paddy, trained the brilliant mare, Dawn Run, to win the Champion
Hurdle and Gold Cup.
Another Irishman, Terry Casey, was celebrating his return to the big
time as Rough Quest stormed home by nine lengths in the Ritz Club Chase.

IN some of the posher suburbs of Glasgow or Edinburgh, #200,000 does
not take you too far in the property market, but if you are prepared to
leave the Central Belt, #200,000 could take you a long way up the Road
to the Isles -- and offer you a business proposition as well.
The Castle Inn at Dornie, only a few miles from Kyle of Lochalsh where
the Skye Bridge is well under construction, is being marketed by
Chesterton at offers over #200,000.
David Reid of Chesterton's Edinburgh office says: ''This property is
situated in one of the most breathtaking locations in Scotland. We feel
that the business is ideal for a husband and wife or family team.''
The hotel has a lounge bar, resident's lounge, restaurant, 13 letting
rooms (eight with en-suite facilities), car park, and chalet. The
owner's accommodation has three bedrooms.
A few years ago, when the property boom allowed Londoners to trade
houses in Hackney for hotels in the Highlands.
David Reid says: ''The market has changed and there is now every
chance that the purchaser will come from central Scotland.''

SCOTLAND scrum-half Andy Nicol is well on the way to recovery from the
disastrous knee injury he sustained in last season's Alloa Cup final and
hopes to play for the first time since then on Saturday week.
Nicol, who is soon to take up employment as a management trainee in
Bath, has joined the West Country club from Dundee HS FP and has been
undergoing almost daily physiotherapy treatment since the injury which
badly damaged an anterior cruciate ligament.
He was one of three Scottish players who were treated last week at the
Lilleshall Sports Injury Centre, and this week he was out training with
his new club.
* SOUTH African prop Johan le Roux has failed is his bid to have a
19-month ban for biting the ear of All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick

suspension, which rules him out of the World Cup.
Television cameras caught le Roux holding Fitzpatrick's head and
inflicting the bite during New Zealand's 13-9 defeat of the Springboks
on July 23.

A MAN'S world? ''No way,'' says Geraldina Cragg. And she means it.
This is in fact her tenth year in her Business and Property Bureau at
Milngavie Road, and she's doing not too badly, thank you very much.
''Even at the start, I was turning away more business than I could
take on,'' she says. ''Right from the beginning, I decided I would go
for the upper end of the rental market, centred on our own area and not
trying to spread out too far. You have to know the property you deal in,
personally.
''We specialise in quality properties. We advise our clients on
matters like local clubs and schools and restaurants. And we have built
up a good rapport with the corporate market over the years as well. That
is increasingly important.
''There are a lot of business people who may want to buy a property,
and take their time in selecting the right place. They also want to be
able to rent a suitable property while they're doing so.
''It may well be they will look for a place that is unfurnished, so
that they can use their own furniture. Whatever they want, that is what
we look to provide.''
With a letting range of #450 to #1500 a month, the Bureau can meet the
needs of a wide selection of clients.
There is, for example, a two-bedroom flat in the heart of Hyndland.
Furnished in an attractive style, with gas central heating, door entry
system, garage, and easy access to all the local amenities, it comes in
at #800 a month.
The kitchen is fully fitted; there is a bathroom and shower. The
property is on the first floor, and it is a relatively new build. Along
the way at Bearsden, for comparison, is a top-of-the-range offer: #1500
for four bedrooms, three public, three bathrooms, fully fitted kitchen,
gas central heating, double garage -- and great views over Glasgow and
the surrounding hills.
There is a steady market for flats in this area as well. Try Lochside,
Roman Court, Birchview and Pinewood for instance.
Typically available with two bedrooms, one or two public rooms,
parking space at least, and most come with their own garaging. Prices
from #600 to #1100.
The same kind of deal is also available in the popular Kelvinside and
Kirklee districts, with prices slightly lower, at #450 to #800.
''We are not into the buying and selling of property,'' Geraldina
adds. ''That is really a separate aspect of the housing business. We
concentrate on what we do best.
''The landlord has to have complete trust and confidence in our
ability to look after the property. The customers have to be sure we are
going to provide exactly what they want.
''We have been asked on occasion to purchase a property, furnish it
and lease it,'' she adds
''We have done that without any problem.''''I don't know about the
men, but I'm certainly looking forward to another enjoyable 10 years.
This is the kind of business where a woman can certainly succeed.''

SELLERS can save hundreds of pounds and plan their budgets more
effectively if they take up a new customer incentive scheme, claims a
leading Scottish estate agent.
Countrywide Estate Agents says that its house seller's package
guarantees:
* No solicitor conveyancing fee
* Free advertising
* Guaranteed all-inclusive sale fee.
The chain of estate agents, formerly known as Nationwide, says that
someone selling a property worth #50,000 could save more than #1000 on
normal charges.
Managing director Mairi Eckford said: ''Apprehension of the
unpredictable costs involved in moving home is behind the idea.
'' It has always upset customers that the costs they may face are
different from those first quoted, because the uncertain nature of the
transaction.''
''How much will the property sell for? How often will it be
advertised? There are all kinds of unpredictable factors.''
She claims that her firm's new package removes all of that
uncertainty, which in today's property market could make the difference
between deciding to move or not for some people.
Countrywide has put the package together by assembling a panel of
legal firms willing to take reduced fees in order to gain access to the
new clients introduced by the estate agents.
''We guarantee to rebate to the customer the solicitor's conveyancing
fee, inclusive of VAT.''
''We do not think a package like this has ever been put together
before, and by removing the uncertainty people face, we believe we will
attract new business.''

LEADERS of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland will take their
fight to save the BBC's daily farming programme to Westminster today
when they meet representatives of all the major political parties,
writes ROBERT ROSS.
They hope to win all-party support for a plan of action to put
pressure on the BBC to reverse its decision.
The NFUS has already indicated its flat refusal to accept BBC
Scotland's decision to axe the 10-minute farming news programme
broadcast every weekday on radio at 12.20pm.
They will follow up this initial reaction by making personal contact
today with party spokesmen while they are in London to submit evidence
to the Scottish Affairs Committee which is currently holding hearings
into the future of agriculture in Scotland.
Tom Brady, chief executive of the NFUS, said that the organisationhad
already written to the BBC and to Government ministers and it was
encouraging individual members and branches to follow that example. ''It
is early days yet but I am sure this issue will build up a good head of
steam,'' he said.
''We will want to see the BBC Scotland controller, Mr John McCormick,
to ensure that he is aware of the strength of feeling, not just among
farmers but among the ancillary professions as well. It is only a few
days since this proposed cut was announced and we have already begun
receiving resolutions from branches and area executives expressing their
concern.''
Barbara Kelly, president of the Rural Forum and chairwoman of the
BBC's Rural Affairs and Agricultural Advisory Committee, added her voice
to the protest. ''Our advisory committee has a meeting with senior BBC
management coming up very soon and we will be raising this matter up
with them,'' she said.
''I am delighted that the NFUS have taken it up so robustly. That is a
good indicator of the depth of feeling.
Mrs Kelly said that she took the view that the BBC had a
responsibility to serve the whole country, not just urban areas. Almost
a quarter of the BBC's listeners lived in rural areas and the
corporation had a duty to reflect their interests and concerns.

A NEW pelleted fertiliser made from treated sewage is being tested by
30 North-east farmers who will spread about 1000 tonnes of granules on
their fields this month.
The granules, which are being provided free of charge by Grampian
Regional Council under a test programme, are said to be odourless and
similar in appearance to inorganic fertilisers. Farmers will be asked to
assess material handling, application and general performance.
European Union regulations, due to be fully implemented by the year
2005, will ban the dumping at sea of untreated sludge from sewage
treatment works. This will leave the proposed North of Scotland Water
Authority with a six-fold increase in the amount to be processed.
Grampian's decision to go for re-cycling is expected to produce a
valuable source of nitrogen and phosphate for the farming and forestry
sectors. John McLeod, assistant director in the department of water
services, said that if the pilot project proved successful it would be
extended.
Dr Alex Sinclair of the Scottish Agricultural College, who will be
monitoring the field trials, said: ''Sludge is not a balanced fertiliser
but it is a valuable source of nitrogen and phosphate and offers the
potential to reduce fertiliser bills.
The material used in the Grampian tests has been bought by the
Regional Council from Wessex Water which has the only operational sludge
dryer in the United Kingdom. If the trials are successful, however,
Grampian will install their own processing plants.
Meanwhile, the fertiliser value of winter muck from a 100-cow dairy
herd is currently about #2500, according to Mr Alan Brewer, pollution
adviser with ADAS -- formerly the agricultural development advisory
service.
He has also calculated that a 12-month contribution from 1000
finishing pigs is worth #4500 and 10,000 layer hens or broilers come in
at about #3000.
''Farmers have the potential to make better use of organic waste,'' he
said. ''Attention must be paid to spreading rates and timing to ensure
that the nutrients in organic manures are taken into account. Inorganic
fertiliser rates should be adjusted accordingly.''
In general, he advocates the use of machinery with a low trajectory
spread pattern which places manures directly on or into the soil at the
right application rate matched to crop requirements.
An increasing number of farmers in South-west Scotland are reported to
be considering injecting liquid fertilizer to get optimum performance
from intensively managed grassland.
Hydro Chafer said that injecting directly into the plant's root zone
helps achieve quicker uptake and ensures that grass gets a strong start
to the growing season.

THE stalled development of the Broomielaw in central Glasgow has
received a kick-start from the new partnership of Pillar Property
Investments and Bellhouse Joseph.
Site clearance has commenced, detailed planning permission is being
sought and funding discussions are underway for a further 133,000 sq ft
phase behind the current Atlantic Quay complex on the riverside.
Construction work could start this summer, says Pillar's Nick Sheehan.
The new plan is to complete all outstanding phases of the development
over the next six to eight years.
Pillar acquired the entire development site last July in a #4.35m deal
with Glasgow &amp; Oriental, the original 50:50 joint venture between
Bellhouse Joseph and the Japanese group Kumagai Gumi.
G &amp; O continues to draw letting income from phase one, the 280,000 sq
ft development occupied by TSB, BAeSema, Stakis, Provincial Insurance
and Scottish Power. But Kumagai Gumi has retrenched its development
activities following a number of difficult years and that, and the UK
property recession, has brought progress on the Broomielaw to a halt.
''We are ready to deliver high specification, flexible office
accommodation more quickly than any other developer in Glasgow'' said Ed
Bellhouse, prime mover in the orginal Atlantic Quay scheme. ''There is
currently no single commercial office space over 50,000 sq ft available
in the city centre. Furthermore there is no building which can offer the
efficient large floor plates that we have here.''
Pillar, formed in 1991 by Arlington Securities, a subsidiary of
British Aerospace, was launched on the Stock Market last August. The two
principals behind Pillar, Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan, originally
targeted the purchase of undervalued property assets, building up a
#50m-plus portfolio in Scotland alone.
These include Consort House and the new Argos store in Glasgow, the
Mercury building in Strathclyde Business Park and retail parks in Irvine
and Dunfermline. Now Pillar is moving into development opportunities in
its own right.
''The great art of property development is getting the timing right''
says Nick Sheehan. He and Bellhouse believe now is the time to relaunch
the Broomielaw scheme.

THERE is a saying that goes: ''With the passing of time, all memories
turn to myth.'' But this year, golf celebrates the fiftieth anniversary
of an achievement -- well, a series of them, actually -- which, from
this distance, seems to take on the force of fiction, but which was a
reality still capable of astounding.
In 1945, Byron Nelson won 11 successive events on the US Tour, and 18
out of 30 in all. He finished first or second in the first eight
tournaments, three of which were won by Sam Snead, and then Nelson
embarked on the imperishable sequence of victories which began on March
11 and ended on August 19 -- five months without losing.
Nelson's average for 120 stroke-play rounds was 68.33. He was 320
shots under par, with 79 rounds in the 60s, and 93 of them under par.
His highest score was 75 -- all that accomplished with clubs and balls
much less sophisticated than they are now, and on courses whose
condition bore not the remotest comparison with today's manicured
acreages.
It began when Nelson partnered Jug McSpaden to victory in the Miami
Fourball and continued in Charlotte, where he beat Snead in a 36-hole
play-off. Then he won the Greensboro Open by eight strokes, the Durham
Open by five, the Atlanta Open by nine, the Montreal Open by 10, and the
Philadelphia Invitational by a less swingeing two.
Having dominated the Chicago Victory Open by seven strokes, Nelson won
that season's only major, the US PGA Championship (then decided by
match-play) at Dayton, the Tam O'Shanter Open, back in Chicago, by 11
strokes, and the Canadian Open in Toronto by four. The spell was finally
broken at Memphis, where Nelson had to be content with fourth.
Nothing daunted, Nelson the next week won the Knoxville Invitational
by 10 strokes from a field which included both Snead and Ben Hogan.
Indeed, the lie was repeatedly given to the assertion that Nelson's
multiplicity of successes was gained against opposition critically
weakened because leading professionals were still on war service.
Not so, since Nelson had to contend with such established
practitioners of the day as Jimmy Demaret, Craig Wood, Ed Oliver, Lloyd
Mangrum, Lawson Little, and Clayton Heafner. But, what is perhaps less
well-known, Nelson not only had begun to assemble this phenomenal run in
1944; he managed to sustain it well into 1946.
In the former year, the Tour partially resumed with 22 events, of
which Nelson won eight -- including four in succession -- and finished
in the first three in 17 of them. In the latter season, he took the
first two events, the Los Angeles Open by five strokes and the San
Francisco Open by nine -- whereby hangs yet another statistic.
Nelson had won the last two tournaments of 1945 -- the Seattle Open by
a resounding 13 strokes and the Glen Garden Invitational by eight -- so
that he had, in effect, again won four consecutive events. But, not
surprisingly, the constant pressure of having to live up to the public's
expectation of him began seriously to upset an already unruly stomach.
Altogether in 1946, Nelson entered 21 tournaments, winning six of them
and losing the US Open to Mangrum only after a 36-hole play-off.
Therefore, in that three-year period Nelson won 32 of the 72 tournaments
in which he played, was out of the first three in only 15 of them, and
only once finished worse than tenth.
At the end of 1946, Nelson, exhausted, retired to his Texas ranch at
the tender age of 34, when now, as even then, a professional golfer is
in his prime.
So how did Nelson do it? He concentrated not so much on brilliant
shot-making as on elimination of error. The coolness of his composure
was such that, according to the American golf historian, Herbert Warren
Wind, a rival once said of him that ''a person receiving a transfusion
from Byron would come down with pneumonia.''

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi continued its fightback yesterday by pointing out
that it had already found new clients to replace half the #30m revenue
lost by Mars' decision to take its business away.
This was the largest customer to defect following the rupture with the
Saatchi brothers, who have since set up their own rival advertising
agency. The other key accounts to go were Gallaher and Mirror Group and
the group is pulling put all stops to persuade British Airways to stay
on board.
Last year Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's profits continued their recovery, rising
69% to #32.4m. But the recent turmoil has persuaded the board against
paying a dividend. Shareholders last received a payout in 1989.
The trading recovery has now come to an abrupt stop, though Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi maintains it has now stabilised its position with regard to
clients and staff. It had hoped to get margins up to 10% this year but
this now looks an impossible goal.
''It is difficult to grow margins when you lose a big account like
Mars unless you can replace that business,'' said chief executive
Charlie Scott.
Mars caused 150 staff to lose their jobs, though the group still
employs 11,000 worldwide. It is retaining much of the Mars team in the
hope of capitalising on its expertise in confectionery and pet food.
Mr Scott said some parts of the group were not achieving fast enough
revenue growth and these were receiving particular attention.
Last year the performance of the individual units in the US differed
considerably as some lost major accounts. Underlying operating profits
rose 14%. In the UK they were only marginally ahead, while Europe picked
up strongly on the back of restructuring, more than doubling its
contribution.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shares edged up 1[1/2]p to 87[1/2]p.

<HEADLINE>Comet and Woolworth drag down profitability. Kingfisher slides by 9.4%</HEADLINE>

THE JURY is still out on Kingfisher and chief executive Sir Geoffrey
Mulcahy, who has a lot to do to restore City confidence.
The retail group which includes Comet and Woolworth has faced several
crises in the past year at both a trading and managerial level. This has
led to lower profits and several high-profile departures from the board
including chief executive Alan Smith and corporate affairs director
Nigel Whittaker.
Last year the group reported its first decline in profits since it was
formed in 1982. Before tax and exceptional items profits fell by 9.4% to
#281.5m. However, the group's confidence in the future was reflected in
the decision to raise the dividend by 2% to 15.2p.
The City was prepared to give the company the benefit of the doubt for
the moment at least, and in erratic trading, the shares gained 5p to
440p.
Group sales rose by 9.1% overall to #4887.7m but this masked a mixed
performance within the various businesses. Woolworth and Comet continued
to be a problem dragging down the overall profitability of the group.
Contrary to earlier indications, and following a thorough review of both
businesses, there are to be no further restructuring provisions made and
both businesses are to remain within the group.
There were no new records put on the Kingfisher turntable yesterday.
The revitalisation of Comet and Woolworth is expected to come from
giving the customers what they want. It seems strange that in the
current highly competitive retail environment Kingfisher thought it
could prosper by doing otherwise.
In the case of Woolworth, the stores had their second consecutive bad
Christmas so much so that a Christmas development director has been
appointed to try to ensure merrier tidings this year.
Overall, Woolies' sales were static but higher operating costs led to
a 31% profits decline to #51.4m.
Going forward, Woolworth intends to target young mothers -- the firm's
core customers, according to Sir Geoffrey. He added that the board was
''committed to building on this unrivalled asset on the High Street''.
The business has a base to build on given the popularity of its Ladybird
kidswear range, confectionery and videos. The store chain is to be
tailored according to whether it is trading in the City centre or in a
market town.
Electrical retailing remains an overcrowded competitive market and
Comet is struggling to stay ahead of the pack. It made a loss of #2m
compared with a previous profit of #16.4m. Attempts to move the product
range upmarket proved disastrous. Customers deserted the stores and
like-for-like sales fell by 9%.
Kingfisher hopes to win back market share by offering a broad product
mix at more competitive prices. New products such as personal computers
are to be introduced in the stores. Although Comet is likely to make a
higher than normal interim loss, Kingfisher is confident that it will
make a modest profit by the end of 1995.
Darty, the French electrical retailer acquired several years ago, is a
model of what Comet would like to achieve. It consolidated its market
leading position and profits rose by 31.4% to #104.1m, making it the
biggest profit earner at Kingfisher. Gradual expansion into other
European markets such as Germany, Spain, and Italy is on the cards.
Elsewhere, in the difficult DIY market, B&amp;Q increased its sales and
profits and consolidated its position as the UK's market leader in the
sector. The twin-track growth strategy of the business, developing large
warehouse stores, and smaller revamped supercentres is to be continued.
Five warehouse stores were opened in the year including a site at
Aberdeen.
Superdrug has yet to reap the full benefits in terms of sales growth
of repositioning its product offer away from low-margin household goods
towards higher-margin health and beauty items. However, higher gross
margins resulted in a 21% increase in its profits. Pharmacies are to be
opened in an initial 40 Superdrug stores. Mr Mulcahy said that the
recent decision by Lloyds Chemists to follow a similar route was a
vindication of the strategy.
The cashflow, gearing and interest charge were all adversely affected
by non-recurring costs. A provision of #38m was made to cover the
estimated closure costs of Charlie Brown's Autocentres and the loss on
closure of Titles Leisure stores.
Kingfisher's board has no illusions about the uphill task it faces in
turning around Comet and Woolworths although it is anticipating a
recovery of sorts in the second half. Overall, the Board believes that
the group is ''in good shape'' but the full benefits of its
restructuring actions are not expected to come through until next year.
Kingfisher shares were among the worst performing in the FTSE index
last year. There is no resaon why anyone should rush to buy the shares.
It remains to be seen whether Comet and Woolworth can be turned round,
and in the meantime, better value can be obtained from shares like Next
and Marks &amp; Spencer.

MARKET expectations that February would see a significant recovery in
High Street sales when the official retail sales figures are published
today received a jolt with the latest CBI quarterly survey showing a
drop in retail sales volumes during the month against a projected small
increase.
But while the survey prompted some concern among economists, it helped
lift share prices as the prospect of a base rate increase in the near
future appeared to recede. Along with a buoyant opening on Wall Street
and weak US retail sales which eased American interest rate pressures,
it boosted the FTSE-Share Index 38.8 points to 3050.6 at the close.
High Street trade was weaker than expected, according to the
Distributive Trades Survey, which also said the underlying three-month
trend in volumes points to a flattening last month in year-on-year
trend. Sales for the time of year remained below average and more so
than at any time over the last two years.
Shop prices also rose more than had been expected at the time of the
last quarterly survey compared to a year ago though the CBI was quick to
point out that the rise was among the smallest seen since the survey
began in 1983 with competitive pressures remaining strong.
The survey is not always a good guide to the Retail Sales Index but
the consensus among forecasters for February had been for an increase of
0.6% after January's unexpected 0.9% decline and the report has
certainly put a dampener on this projection.
Commenting on the findings yesterday, Alastair Eperon, who has
succeeded Nigel Whittaker as chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades
Survey Panel, said British retailers could face a period of flat sales
rather than a long, slow slide in volumes.
''It is not a very encouraging picture,'' he said, suggesting that a
lack of consumer confidence was squeezing margins, particularly among
the smaller retailers. It was also forcing retailers to re-direct
investment toward labour-saving and efficiency-enhancing measures.
Consumers, he added, were suffering from ''fragile confidence'' rather
than a ''feel-bad'' factor.
Employment across the distributive trades, covering retail, wholesale
and motor, remained virtually unchanged for the second quarterly survey
in succession, a trend which is expected to continue. However,
employment in retailing fell for the fourth consecutive survey,
reflecting further declines in full-time work and the first drop in
part-time jobs for over two years.
February's increase in prices over the same period a year ago,
represents a slight pick-up since since November. A further rise in
selling prices is anticipated in March by all sectors although retailers
were unable to raise prices in line with their expectations in the
preceding two surveys.
Business was shown to be rather mixed across the individual retailing
sectors in February with almost as many sectors reporting year-on-year
reductions in volumes as increases. The largest rises were reported by
chemists -- following a sharp fall in January -- with confectioners,
booksellers and stationers along with durable household goods retailers
all reporting moderate sales growth.
Those reporting a sharp decline in sales compared with a year ago were
furniture and carpet retailers, specialist food retailers -- such as
butchers and bakers -- and hardware, china, and DIY retailers.
Lex Gold, director, CBI Scotland, commented: ''The underlying three
monthly trend has pointed to a slowing in annual sales growth in recent
months and the latest fall in High Street trade comes as little
surprise.
''The fact that the increase that had been expected in retail sales
was not fulfilled last month is typical of the uneven trading conditions
that High Street shops have experienced over the past year. Selling
prices have risen quicker than retailers either reported or expected in
the last quarterly survey. But the increase remains among the
smallest.''
Motor traders' sales have fallen further, though only slightly, in
February and business for the time of year remains below average.

ALTHOUGH Irish golfers will continue to be considered for selection to
this year's Walker Cup side, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, through
its secretary Michael Bonallack, has expressed ''surprise and
disappointment'' at the Golfing Union of Ireland's decision to enter a
separate team for the next Eisenhower Trophy.
The GUI's explanation was that so few Irish golfers had been chosen
for the four-man teams since 1958, the event's inaugural year. However,
Bonallack pointed out that since a combined side had won the event only
three times, separate sides were unlikely to fare better.
Echoing Bonallack's sentiments, Ian Hume, secretary of the Scottish
Golf Union, said yesterday: ''We, like England and Wales, strongly
support the established position. We would much rather have had a full
discussion than to have had no prior warning of Ireland's intentions.''
However, since entries for the 1996 World Amateur Team championship,
to be played in November in the Philippines, do not have to be submitted
for another year, there is no immediate hurry to resolve the issue.
Ironically, three Irish events are among the 15 which selectors will
attend to view Walker Cup candidates.
This year, eight of the 10 players to meet the United States at Royal
Porthcawl on September 9 and 10, will be chosen immediately after the
European Team championships in Antwerp in July. The last two places will
be filled after the new Mid-Amateur championship at Sunningdale the
following month.
This means that, for the first time, performances in the four national
close championships can be taken into account.
But before this long and busy season even starts, Bernard Gallacher,
the Ryder Cup captain, will cast his experienced eyes over aspiring
claimants at a second squad training session at Porthcawl next month.
As well as the championships of the Home Unions, the other events at
which selectors will be present are:
Lytham Trophy and Berkshire Trophy, both May 6 and 7; Irish
Inter-Provincials, May 17-19; Brabazon Trophy, May 19-21; St Andrews
Links Trophy, May 27 and 28; Amateur Championship, June 5-10; Irish
Amateur Open, June 15 and 16; Scottish Strokeplay championship, June 17
and 18; Welsh Strokeplay championship, June 23-25; European Team
championships, July 5-9; and Mid-Amateur championship, August 16-20.
Other British rankings: 30, T Johnson (Eng) 76.02; 53, L Fairclough
(Eng) 44.50; 72, A Nicholas (Eng) 37.32; 78, H Wadsworth (Wal) 33.50; 83

YORKSHIRE-Tyne Tees Television has scrambled its way out of disaster
with the #4.6m loss made in the six months to March 1994 turned into a
#10.5m profit for a full 15 month period. That was after it recovered
from the ill-thought out policy of overselling advertising in late 1993
and which severely damaged advertisers confidence at a time when
recession continued to bite.
The net effect had been to reduce market voice as measured by NAR to
9.6% and which is now recovering towards 11%. That has been helped by
some improvement in car advertising although Yorkshire does suffer as do
others from being sited a long way away from the advertising agencies in
London which have strange ideas at times as to what happens north of
Watford.
The combined licence fee paid to the Independent Television Commission
of an annualised #62m or so does at first sight appear very heavy in
comparison with Scottish Television's mere #2000 However, some at
Yorkshire argue that the Glasgow based company's ''true'' licence cost
is about #20m because of its requirement to produce a huge volume of
regional programming which is well in excess of its UK market share.
Programming sales at the Leeds based company amounted to about #72m
and which will show little change this time round with hits such as
Heartbeat, A Touch of Frost and and Catherine Cookson.
Chairman Ward Thomas does not expect a significant change in the
regime to be announced by the Heritage Department and would be quite
happy with cross- media ownership which would allow newspapers to
increase their holdings from the present 20% to 29.9%. He is staying on
as chairman until the new licence agreements are thrashed out which
should result in a reduction in the company's current impost.
He argues in favour of Channel 5 being owned by the current ITV
companies. He does not forsee any move to allow an increase from the
current franchise limit of two licences -- otherwise Granada would storm
over the Pennines -- and Scottish Televison would be swamped with
offers.
Yorkshire is now fairly cash rich and is using some of these funds to
expand its investment in educational TV in association with the Thomas
Nelson subsidiary of International Thomson in the development of CD-ROM
-- already an international prize has been won.
Yorkshire profits this year should rise to about #11.5m. The dividend
total is well above expectations with a 4.7p final after a nominal
interim payment which helped push the shares 27p ahead to 393p.

GEARING hurt Dunedin Income Growth in the year to end-January,
although the investment trust's reliance on loans could produce benefits
if its bullish predictions for UK equities are realised.
Fund manager Alan Clark believes recent sterling weakness and
political strife have detracted from a healthy corporate picture in the
UK and considers shares cheaply priced.
The Edinburgh-based fund's earnings per share rose 2.5% to 28.07p but
the increase in total dividend was limited to 1.9% -- below the rate of
inflation.
Dunedin will pay out 26.6p, after declaring a final dividend of 17.7p.
Net asset value fell 20.5% to 623.4p during the twelve months.
However, the trust's poor performance relative to a slide of only 15.2%
in the FTSE All-Share index was down to gearing.
The #299m fund had loans of #97m at the year-end and the underlying
capital performance of Dunedin's UK equity portfolio, selected largely
from the top 350 companies, was in line with the All-Share index.

THE Securities and Future Authority has barred some directors of the
crashed Barings merchant bank from conducting securities business. This
has been done by refusing them the registration they need as directors
of companies under the bank's new owners. The SFA said it will not grant
authorisation until the Bank of England has completed its investigation
into the failure.
However, SFA chairman Christopher Sharples said that he had agreed
with the now owners ING of Holland that the individuals could continue
working within the bank.
It is seen as a holding operation until the dust settles and the full
story is known about the involvement of various bank officials in London
and by Barings dealer Nick Leeson in Singapore who ran up losses of well
over #600m.
There is concern in some quarters that other merchant banks will find
it difficult to draw in deposits traditionally lent by corporate clients
and by funds such as pensions managed by the bank. Trustees in some
cases may well insist that all monies are deposited with the large
authorised UK high street retail banks where the Bank of England is the
lender of last resort and effectively guarantees loan repayment.

THE family goes to war at Twickenham on Saturday. When Scotland and
England line up to do battle in the great Grand Slam showdown, the Bath
Brigade will take centre stage.
The famous West Country club, which in the recent past spawned
Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam captain David Sole, will have no fewer than
10 players on parade.
Within the Scottish ranks will be David Hilton and Eric Peters -- Five
Nations' try scorers both -- while lining up for England will be Mike
Catt, Jerry Guscott, Victor Ubogu, and Ben Clarke.
Additionally, on the England replacements' bench will be Jon Callard,
Graham Dawe, Phil de Glanville, and Steve Ojomoh.
Peters, a son of Dumbarton before moving south with his parents when
he was three, maintains there will be no divided loyalties, and no
quarter asked or given by club team-mates at Twickenham.
''They call the Bath club the family, but on Saturday we'll be wearing
different shirts, and striving for a different cause.
''When you're playing for Bath, then Bath is the only thing that
counts, and it is the same when you're wearing a Scotland shirt.
''The England boys will get just the same feeling of pride from
wearing The Rose that I get from wearing The Thistle,'' he said.
Peters, 26, has played for Bath half-a-dozen times since joining the
club from Cambridge University last year. ''There are six international
back-row players -- Jon Hall, Steve Ojomoh, Ben Clarke, Andy Robinson,
Dave Egerton and me -- at the club, and they alternate us to keep us all
happy.
''We go to Twickenham on Saturday as underdogs, but we have absolutely
nothing to lose. We'll be giving it our best shot.
''So far as the back-row is concerned, I know Ben's play and he knows
mine so maybe we'll be able to defend against each other better, but
that's about as far as it goes.
''I've never been in this situation before at international level, but
I suppose it's a bit like when you were at school and playing house
matches. Your mates were in the other side and you knew them well, but
that just made you try even harder.''
Clarke, who will play on the open side flank for England on Saturday,
often alternates with Peters in the Bath No.8 berth. He said: ''It's
certainly an interesting prospect, two back-row players from the same
club playing against each other in an international. I know how Eric
plays and he knows how I play, and so, to a large extent, neither of us
has an advantage.
''He'll be playing to his strengths and I'll be playing to mine. He's
a good all-round player who is always turning up where you don't want to
see him.
''We've made a point of not discussing Saturday's game. In 1990, the
Scots took us a bit by surprise and so we'll be playing our cards pretty
close to our chests. There'll be time enough to talk about the game over
a pint on Saturday night.''
The England flanker reckons that the game will be very close. ''I
certainly wouldn't say that the Scots are underdogs. We've watched them
very closely on video, and they've been playing some great rugby this
season. The only real advantage that we have is that we are playing at
home.''
Clarke revealed, too, that the events of March 17, 1990, at
Murrayfield still weigh heavily on English minds. ''The players that
were involved that day will never forget what happened. I think that
works to our benefit, though, because we don't intend to be taken by
surprise again.''
Dave Hilton, the Scotland tight-head prop who hails from Bristol but
plays for Bath, and who obtained his Scottish credentials from a
Scottish grandfather, will be in direct confrontation on Saturday with
Recreation Ground team-mate Victor Ubogu.
''That doesn't cause me any problems at all. So far as I'm concerned,
it will be a straightforward loose-head versus tight-head confrontation
but you can be sure that neither of us will want to lose.''
Hilton, who works for the family butcher's business in Bristol, has
even invested in a kilt and full Highland evening dress to celebrate his
full Five Nations' campaign.
''I wanted to wait to make sure that I wasn't going to be a one-cap
wonder, but I've now got the full outfit for wearing to the dinner after
the game.''
Hilton's conversion to the land of his grandfather has been met with
mixed feelings among the customers at his Bristol emporium.
''I've taken a fair bit of stick. They're all chuffed for me, of
course, and they're saying have a good game on Saturday. But mind you
lose.''

Are American-style image consultants poised to make a killing in
British courts? Kennedy Wilson reports
WHILE the debates rage about whether advocates and judges in the High
Court should continue to wear traditional wigs and gowns, the matter of
what the accused in the dock should or shouldn't wear is rarely
discussed. Not in this country at least.
In the US the situation is different. There, hired court consultants
regularly suggest and recommend what the accused should wear to create
the best impression on jurors. It's a case of not so much dressing to
impress as dressing to acquit.
The 11-year-old American Society of Trial Consultants has boomed in
recent years. The rubric goes something like this -- in debt or fraud
cases it pays to look down-at-heel, the accused may be advised to remove
his expensive Rolex watch. If you are too smart it could destroy your
credibility.
In a murder case a defendant wearing a dark blue or black suit can
connote power and even menace which his lawyer may want to play down.
It's notable that O J Simpson, charged with a particularly brutal double
killing, has been dressed for court in sober grey suits and immaculate
white shirts.
According to Marie Staunton, editor of the Solicitors Journal: ''Most
criminal solicitors will say to their clients 'smarten up and look
respectable in court'. And many carry a tie around with them in their
pocket. They have to do that because many of their clients have no
notion of how to appear so that they look as if they have respect for
the court.
''Solicitors are very aware of the impression people make but it's at
that very basic level. Image consultants usually offer their services to
solicitors so that they (the solicitors) can impress their clients. In
America it's different because there are trial consultants who advise on
juries because there is a lot of jury vetting there that does not apply
here.''
Edinburgh lawyer Ray Megson says: ''When the jury come in, the first
person they are interested in is the accused, whose future they have in
their hands, so obviously the impression conveyed is very important.''
Clearly it varies from case to case as to what advice a lawyer gives
his client. ''With someone who's charged with a complicated fraud then I
wouldn't have him sitting in the court in a suit, I'd have him
relatively casually dressed. For someone charged with a nasty, evil type
of assault I'd have him looking as presentable as possible, as if butter
wouldn't melt in his mouth,'' says Megson.
One defence lawyer, who prefers not to be named, says: ''I don't
advise clients on what to wear because most of them are better dressed
than I am!''
It's best to look at well-known situations to see how differently
people dress in court. For example, in the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow
hearing, Allen continued to wear his trademark tweed jacket and corduroy
trousers while, according to one court observer, Farrow adopted ''an
apparently contrived effort to look like a demure Catholic convent
girl'' in flat shoes and Peter Pan collars.
At the time of the Profumo scandal Christine Keeler and Mandy
Rice-Davies attempted to look wholesome and composed although not always
successfully. Ludovic Kennedy wrote of Rice-Davies: ''Astride her golden
head sat a little rose-petalled hat, such as debutantes wear at garden
parties. Her simple grey sleeveless dress accentuated the impression of
modesty -- until one looked closely. Then one saw the slit down the
front, when she walked one could see right up her leg.''
The Menendez brothers, accused of parricide in California, ''walked
like colts'' in court dressed in suits ''if not by Armani himself, by a
designer heavily influenced by Armani,'' according to writer Dominic
Dunne. The Menendez boys' sartorial elegance so accentuated their
smirking arrogance that after the initial hearings the brothers disposed
of the suits and wore boy-next-door sweaters and open-necked shirts.
Are British courts in line for the image consultants? ''It's just a
matter of minutes,'' says Mary Spillane, managing director of top image
consultants CMB. According to Kenneth Pritchard, Secretary of the Law
Society of Scotland: ''I am wholly unaware of this sort of development
in the United Kingdom. I accept that this is a matter of concern but I
do believe that there are far greater matters of concern with regard to
the fairness of the accused than what he wears when he is in court.
''The very fact that the accused is called that and the very fact that
he sits in a clearly identifiable part of the court, namely the dock,
and in solemn cases he is seated between two police officers makes him
stick out like a sore thumb and that is, in my view, extremely
unfortunate.
''The accused should, as with the American courts, sit with his
advisers and as far as possible be dressed in a way which does not
immediately distinguish him as the accused, particularly where
identification is important to the case.
''I think it is entirely fair that the accused should appear in court
in appropriate dress. What is wholly improper would be deliberate
attempts to change his appearance, for instance, somebody who at the
time of the commission of an offence is wearing a beard had it removed
by the time of the trial (or vice versa).''
Mary Spillane adds: ''I certainly have advised law firms on the image
of their company and they invariably raise the issue of advice for the
people they are defending.'' Sunday Best is not enough. ''How a guy
moves in a suit is important. You can't take a yobbo and put him in a
suit and expect him to look and behave like a church-going citizen. Even
if he's just sitting there he may squirm about, look uncomfortable, and
won't carry it off. How he sits and comports himself is also very
important.''
Research suggests that juries think of their role as a solemn duty
like church or any other official proceeding. ''Jurors are not going to
react very well to defendants who do not take the court seriously. The
answer is that UK lawyers use their common sense rather than image
consultants,'' said the Solicitors Journal's Marie Staunton.

Andrew Lothian relates a case which is now part of legal history -- as
well as being part of his family history
ALARGE crowd awaited the prisoners outside the Court House in
Parliament Square but a cordon of policemen was requisitioned to clear
the square and an ordinary four-wheeled cab then drove up to the court
house door.
At about 10 minutes to one Mrs Cameron, preceded by a constable, and
leaning heavily on the arm of the wardress, who has been in court all
week, made her appearance and entered the cab. Lieutenant Cameron
followed and took his place in the cab opposite his wife, while a police
sergeant sat by his side. The windows of the cab were immediately closed
and it drove off through the crowd waiting in the High Street down the
North Bridge to the Calton Jail.
This account, which I have taken verbatim from the Edinburgh Evening
News of Saturday, June 3, 1911, was the last word on a case that had
scandalised Edwardian Edinburgh and had led to the disgrace, and
imprisonment for three years, of a well-connected young couple. All but
forgotten now, I think it may deserve another look, if for no more
important a reason than that I suspect the attendant wardress to have
been my Great Aunt Lexie, then a young girl from rural Perthshire making
her way in the big city.
The charge against Cecil Aylmer Cameron and his wife, Ruby, was that,
having insured a pearl necklace for #6500 on December 5, 1910, they
pretended that it had, on the foot-pavement outside Inman's Stores in
Shandwick Place on February 8, 1911, been snatched from the neck of Mrs
Cameron by a robber, and on this basis made a fraudulent claim against
the underwriters.
The proximity of the two dates might suggest to the charitable that
the Camerons, relative newcomers to Edinburgh, had done well to assess
the degree of criminality prevalent in the West End and had arranged
their affairs with consequent prudence. The prevailing view was that the
whole thing was pretty fishy.
The trial, before Lord Justice General Dunedin and a jury, lasted for
five days, with the prosecution led by the Solicitor General (Hunter)
and the accused defended respectively by Messrs Morrison KC and Clyde
KC. All three became judges later, with Clyde being Dunedin's only real
rival as the greatest Scots lawyer of the century.
The case of His Majesty's Advocate v Camerons was to enter our law
reports as a result of something having happened that led to Lord
Dunedin telling the jury that ''the prosecutor has left a very ugly hole
in the case''. What happened was that as a result of what his Lordship
called ''a bad blunder'' no evidence was led that Mrs Cameron had ever
made a claim on the insurance company. There was a letter, certainly,
but it seems that the person -- a law clerk -- whom the prosecution
thought would be able to speak to it as being that of Mrs Cameron could
do no such thing.
Lord Dunedin's reaction to this makes interesting reading. ''I foresaw
this some time ago -- as it happened, really, I think, on the first day
of the trial -- and it gave me very great anxiety, because it certainly
was a question whether it did not ruin the case altogether.''
He went on to say that he considered the matter himself, that he had
discussed it with some of his fellow judges and that he had gone back to
the fount of all criminal law in Scotland, the writings of Baron Hume
(late-eighteenth century) in search of the answer to the question, which
he poses in Hume's own words: ''How far must the culprit have proceeded
in the prosecution on his wicked purpose to make him answerable in the
tribunals of this world?''
In other words, Hume, and after him Dunedin, was proposing the
everlasting question, at what point does sin become crime?
There was no doubt, of course, that Mrs Cameron had sent the letter in
question; the trouble was that it had not been judicially proved that
she had. So what Lord Dunedin did was to run through the various actings
of the Camerons which the jury might find had been proved properly.
This involved the false reporting of the robbery to the police and
certain other communings with the underwriters, which appeared to be
antecedent to the making of a formal claim. Then with the simplicity
that can be achieved only by a clear mind, he gave to them the
direction: ''Assuming that you find that there is a conspiracy at all,
you have to consider whether what was done had got beyond the stage of
preparation into the stage of perpetration.''
Thus were the Solicitor General's chestnuts hauled out of the fire,
and thus there was perfected an interesting weapon in the fight against
crime. This was that, when dealing with an uncompleted crime, actings
that fell short in law of constituting an actual attempt might be
sufficient to bring home guilt provided you could show that they were
done as part of a criminal conspiracy. Thus, paradoxically, since you
cannot conspire with yourself, it became easier to convict two people
than one.
What do we know about these Camerons, who inadvertently contributed to
our criminal law? He was an Army lieutenant and they lodged at the
highly desirable New Town address of 2 Heriot Row. They had not been
long in the city at the time of their unsuccessful foray into crime and
they do not seem to have made many friends, although they had a number
of letters of introduction to help them on their way.
One is tempted to think of them as not well-off, except that the
necklace which they owned must have been worth about half a million
pounds at today's prices. In his charge, the judge left open to the jury
the possibility that the scheme had been devised by Mrs Cameron on her
own, with her husband acting only to protect her after the fact,
something for which the judge said: ''Few would have the heart to blame
him,'' but this, as we have seen, the jury rejected.
As for my great aunt, she left the prison service not long after and
gave up her maiden name of Robertson to marry a man called, of all
things, Cameron.

NICK Price, the holder, will be joined by at least eight former
winners of the title when the Open Championship is played from July 20
to 23 at St Andrews -- the twenty-fifth occasion on which the event will
have been held over the Old Course. .
The 24 exempt players who are among the 112 from whom entries have so
far been received include the last three winners at headquarters -- Nick
Faldo (1990), Severiano Ballesteros (1984), and Jack Nicklaus (1970 and
1978). Nicklaus and Raymond Floyd, it is rumoured, may be taking their
farewells of the championship.
Peter Greenhough, chairman of the championship committee, said that
entries were up to expectations in strength and numbers and would be
sustained by the fact that the Open now counts both on the US Tour's
money list and for American Ryder Cup team points, the contest for
which, as with Europe's side, will be approaching its conclusion.
The impression that the Old Course is not up to challenging the best
professionals in the world armed with the latest technological advances
in equipment is itself challenged by the figures. In the last two opens
the stroke average was 72.66, against par of 72.
Nevertheless, one of the most feared holes in golf, the seventeenth,
will have stiffer resistance built into it. The bank down from behind
the green to the road will have deeper rough so that it will become all
but impossible for an overhit ball to be putted back up the slope.
Including the new clubhouse, whose function during the championship
has still to be decided, and caddies' pavilion, the tidying up of roads
and work on the course itself, #3m will have been spent in preparing for
the 124th championship. By all accounts the course has never been in
better condition for the time of year.
Walter Woods, the links superintendent who will be retiring from the
staff after 21 years' service, including four Opens, said that work
started two years ago on the 117 bunkers was 70% completed, and that the
example copied from Carnoustie of using plastic mats for fairway shots
had worked wonders.
These will have been in force from December 1 until May 1, and to
limit damage further the local clubs will play their spring medals on
the New Course. As it is, the course only reopened on Monday after a
month's rest, and there is a noticeable reduction in the number of divot
marks.

The normally xenophobic French
fashion industry is in raptures over
an invasion force assembled this
week -- the British are over in
force, and they're sweeping all
before them. Francesca Fearon
reports from Paris on the impact of
the snazziest shock troops in town
Galliano weaves
a web of mystery
around an
imaginary
heroine who
becomes his
muse for
the season
IN THE early eighties it was the Japanese designers who laid siege
toParis, sending the custodians of style into a spin with their radical,
nihilistic view of fashion. Japanese minimalism, origami-cutting
technique and a sombre colour palette have had a profound and lasting
impact on design in the world's fashion capital.
In the nineties, however, the Parisians are bowing to a new invasion,
the Brits -- like Napoleon at Waterloo, a threat they didn't take
seriously at first, but now perhaps grudgingly respect. When the
international fashion buyers and press descend on Paris twice a year (as
they have being doing this week) for the ready-to-wear collections, the
most coveted invitations are not just for Chanel and Jean-Paul Gaultier,
but a group of four British designers. John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood,
Rifat Ozbek and the group's latest addition, John Rocha, are the hottest
shows on their schedules.
In Britain they are considered at the peak of their profession. All
are former winners of the British Fashion Designer of the Year; Vivienne
Westwood has won it twice and John Galliano currently holds the title
for the second time. Yet the drawing power Paris has on the
international fashion cognoscenti has lured them across the Channel to
parade their collections on the French catwalks, where they are greeted
with acclaim.
Vivienne Westwood is venerated as one of the six most influential
designers of the century by Women's Wear Daily, the fashion bible. John
Galliano is hailed as a genius, a description with which even Karl
Lagerfeld, who is not in the habit of praising fellow designers, would
concur. When asked by British Vogue if he thought of Galliano as a
genius he said: ''Yes . . . but better not say it too often because it
can make a person lazy.'' In a French industry survey published last
week by Journal du Textil both were voted among the top three designers
on the Paris catwalk.
Westwood and Galliano, observers say, should have their own couture
houses, for their cutting and tailoring skills are firmly rooted in the
craftsmanship of the couturier's atelier. Indeed, rumours flew round
Paris during the couture collections last January that Galliano would
assume the mantle of creative director at Givenchy when Hubert de
Givenchy retires. After digesting the views of industry insiders
including the British press, the house is expected to make the
appointment official in the next month. Certainly his
exotically-tailored suits and devastating ball gowns, like Westwood's
provocative visions of femininity (corsets and padded derrieres), are
treated with reverence in the xenophobic world of Paris couture. And the
respect is mutual.
Rifat Ozbek and John Rocha are the modernists in the group. Ozbek,
backed by Aeffe (the company owned by Italian designer Alberta
Ferretti), originally took his collections to the Milan runway where
Katharine Hamnett now shows. Then three seasons ago he switched to Paris
and realised a long-held dream. John Rocha transferred to Paris last
season. From his base in Dublin it proved to be no more expensive than
showing in London, but wisdom persuaded him that Paris would reach a
larger audience. ''It was a commercial decision and received a good
response,'' says Rocha. ''Paris is the centre of fashion with more
customers from Europe and the Far East.'' Ozbek certainly admits it's
tougher, but the move was worth taking, judging by the growth of his
reputation in France.
Ozbek's collections are a heady blend of sculpted shapes in futuristic
fabrics with ethnic touches often inspired by his Turkish roots. For
spring he produced shiny fencing jackets and little dresses with sprigs
of floral embroidery. The ideas are sexy and witty with clothes made to
be mixed rather than matched. That collection made a feature of the
tyranny of the shoulder pad. The collection he unveils in Paris will
take padding further, using it to sculpt chiffon in a theme described as
''space princess with an ethnic twist''.
There is a rich textural feel to Rocha's collections in the way he
mixes traditional and modern materials like hand-painted velvets,
flannel, pearlised leather and a matt nylon. His ideas are often
inspired by Celtic imagery and draw on Ireland's innate tailoring
skills. His autumn collection, though, which is scheduled just before
Galliano's on Friday, focuses on his flair for creating tender
silhouettes from combinations of fragile fabrics and lush textures.
Galliano weaves a web of mystery around an imaginary heroine who
becomes his muse for the season. Westwood's muses, however, are
historical creatures with intellectual leanings much like the designer
herself. This season she promises to be the French cocotte Ninon de
L'Enclos, offering the designer a wealth of historical references for
her collection.

MYRA McKinlay was close to tears after a nightmare opening round of 82
in the 72 holes American Express Tour qualifying school at La Manga in
Spain yesterday.
''That was horrendous and just about as bad as I could play,'' said
the Scot who is now in danger of missing the cut after today's second
round.
Her sand wedge went missing from her golf bag as she left the practice
ground on Monday, a spectator having taken the club out, then carelessly
replaced it in the bag of Irish golfer Lynn McCool.
McCool discovered the club when she arrived at the course, but by then
McKinlay, out first, had started her round with a borrowed wedge. ''It
is a club I have used for seven years and I couldn't concentrate,''
added McKinlay.
The Curtis Cup player ran up bogeys at six out of seven holes from the
third, and added a triple bogey 7 at the sixteenth.
It left her 11 adrift of Jill McGill, the 1993 US Amateur champion,
who was the only player to better par with a one-under 71 in breezy
conditions. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
71 -- J McGill (USA).
72 -- N Fink (Austria), L Percival, D Booker (Australia), P Gonzalez
(Colombia).
73 -- S Knauber (Germany), R Bolas, D Parks (USA), A-C Jonasson
(Sweden), S Dallongeville (France), M-G Estuesta (Philippines).
Scottish scores: 77 -- L Irvine. 80 -- J Kinloch. 81 -- T Craik, M
Wright. 82 -- M McKinlay.
* THE West Alliance Pro-am for the Collinson Shearer Trophy, due to be
played today at Paisley, has been postponed until next Wednesday with
the same tee-off times applying.

A CASE was called over the loudspeaker for a hearing at the Justiciary
Appeal Court bang on 10am, but, as often happens, the judges did not
appear on the Bench for another 20 minutes or so. One waiting advocate
suggested that the early announcement must be regarded as a clear case
of premature adjudication.
Screen gems
IT is pleasing to know that legal courtesy still survives in Internet
slang. IMHO is the short form for In My Humble Opinion and for lovers of
Glasgow patois there is also BTW, by the way. But the Diary is mystified
at the Cathy Beale nickname coined for the police computer at
Musselburgh which is always going down. Whatever can they mean?
Last stop
NEWS that London Underground is seeking sponsorship for stations will
probably not go down well at the Law Courts in the Strand. The legal
fraternity there lost their stop at Aldwych last September. No prospect
of appeal either, unless to rename it (posthumously) Down the Tube. The
wigs will continue to have to leg it down to Chancery Lane or Bank, for
which we can now, presumably, rule out a take-over by Barings.
Name game
ALTHOUGH this newspaper does go in for eponymous locomotives, it draws
the line at sheriffs. A case was called before Sheriff John Herald at
Greenock for the accused Stephen Young, whose shrieval namesake, Sir
Stephen Young, was laying down the law in No 1 court. As an arrest
warrant was issued, one wag remarked: ''Would anyone like to enforce
this next door?''
Meanwhile, the Scottish Daily Express ruffled its True Blue
credentials with a brief story quoting ''David'' Findlay QC. It was
probably a word association football mix-up with Donald's chairman at
Rangers, their own scoopsearcher David Cameron, or the real David
Finlay, the dapper UNS news agency reporter at Parliament House.
Bastions of
the Law (No 72)
CONFLICTS with the civil and criminal law have given rise to more
trouble for the Ministry of Defence than the Red Army ever did.
Paratroopers are placed on probation for a vicious assault because
they are more use fighting in the Army than out, what constitutes murder
by soldiers in Northern Ireland or Cyprus is still unclear, and
settlements over maternity have cost more frigates, tanks and fighters
than any real combat.
But not all former army officers are in the tacky, kiss-and-tell
Hewitt mould and we are pleased to report a demonstration of more
traditional soldierly virtues. Keith Hoile fought a lengthy campaign for
natural justice which pitched him against a formidable battery of
Scottish Office lawyers and NHS bureaucracy.
The battle lines were drawn up eight years ago with the first hints
that he, then aged 58, was to be elbowed out of his job as public
relations officer for Grampian Health Board.
In 1988 he and others were made redundant but they were offered a lump
sum and an enhanced pension for early retirement under NHS rules. More
than a bit miffed, he went to an industrial tribunal which found in his
favour, castigated the board for failing to re-engage him and awarded
the maximum of #11,780.
But it was a Pyrrhic victory. The Scottish Office said because he had
won his case for unfair dismissal he was not made redundant and
therefore not due his enhanced pension. It demanded #3500 from his lump
sum and chopped #1000 of his pension.
''It is an anomaly in the law,'' Hoile said. ''I was claiming I was
unfairly made redundant, but an industrial tribunal can only say you
were unfairly dismissed, and if you were dismissed you cannot be made
redundant.''
His typewriter was kept endlessly busy bombarding all and sundry with
letters. Finally, after an inquiry by Health Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie, he won his case and got the money he was due.
All of which shows that old soldiers can pick up their pensions and
you shouldn't underestimate a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal
Anglians.
His advice to others involved in long-standing wrangles is to keep
fighting and nil desperandum: ''I said at the start that I would fight
this until the last nail was in my coffin. It was OK for me. I have got
a good education, and knew how to write letters and keep badgering
people. But what about the poor little sod who's a porter or a cleaner
and is told to get stuffed by the Scottish Office?''

SCOTHOT 95, the 12th Scottish Hotel Catering and Licensed Trade
Exhibition, at the SECC in Glasgow from March 20 to 23, is bigger than
ever before.
This time round the bi-ennial event has 25% more display space filling
four halls of the Clydeside venue as well as hosting the 20th Salon
Culinaire north of the border and the second, trade only, Wine Scotland
show. Organisers SITE, Scottish Industrial and Trade Exhibitions
Limited, have produced an impressive 15-page list of exhibitors ranging
alphabetically from ACR Cash Register Systems to Zojirushi Scotland,
vacuum products specialists.
The top Scottish trade show ranks among the top three in Britain --
40% of Scotland's catering and licensed trade delay their equipment
purchases until they see what's on offer in ScotHot's national shop
window. There are around 500 major companies exhibiting, with thousands
of great ideas and new products on offer to help boost profits and
manage resources more effectively. It has been estimated that 82% of
visitors to ScotHot are on the lookout for new food and drink products
to improve their restaurants, bars, off-licenses and delicatessens.
This year there is a spectacular array. What about chilli pecuito -- a
halved, crisply-coated, jalapeno pepper stuffed with cream or a new
gumbo-based and ready-made jambalaya? The taste of Scotland will also be
readily at hand.
Luxury soft scoop ice-cream, Florentine omelettes and mini-Indian
savouries, guava, mango and lychee juices and Austrian gluhwein from the
ski slopes clammer for the palate's attention. Wheat, rye, oats, barley,
flax and sunflower seeds all contribute to making healthy, multi-cereal
baguettes and a new elderflower spritzer should whet the appetite for
further delights to come.
Breweries will also be represented with pints of real ale and mixed
gases products available for sampling and consideration. Hot nuts and
crisps can also be supplied.
There is equipment in abundance on the stands. Computerised cash
register systems vie with catering and beveridge dispensing devices for
client attention. Espresso machines in all their efficiency and high
speed grills for faster food compete with refrigerated food trolleys and
microwave and potato baking ovens. Heavy duty commercial and industrial
laundry equipment takes its necessary place alongside dishwashers, food
processors, rotor blenders and other ancillary catering aids. Shelving
dishracks and plate stackers complement glass-washing machines and money
counters. Furniture, ceramic tablewear, stainless steel cutlery,
glassware and soup kettles congregate with artificial trees and plants.
ScotHot 95 is a veritable Aladdin's cave.
The four-day seminar programme is always popular. Apart from the Storm
in a Teacup session sponsored by Caterer &amp; Hotelkeeper from 10.30am
until 12 noon on March 22 in the Adam Room (the #25 charge goes to the
Hospitality Industry Trust, Scotland), the rest are free. Places are
limited though and early booking is normally recommended. A healthy
eating forum from 11am until 12.30pm on March 20 in the Adam Room gets
the short season off to a hard-hitting start.
The chefs' conference from 2pm until 4pm on March 22 also in the Adam
Room is certain to be a great draw. Celebrity chef Antony Worrall
Thompson from London's dell'Ugo restaurant will be in attendance.
Among the many ScotHot highlights this year are a chef's surgery on
presented by the Scottish Chefs Association, the vegetarian kitchen
sponsored by Catering in Scotland is bound to be a healthy attraction
and a drinks mixing demonstrations by the UK Bartenders Guild. There's
also medieval merriment with the 'Sair Feet Theatre Company'.
No ScotHot exhibition would be complete without The Scottish Culinary
Championships now celebrating the 20th Salon Culinaire. Organised by the
Scottish Division of the Cooker and Food Association, the Salon
Culinaire d'Ecosse has been a central part of the Scottish Hotel
Catering and Licensed Trade Exhibition since 1973. The person gaining
the highest points in the open hot and cold classes will be declared the
1995 Scottish Culinary Champion and will be presented with the Adam
Trophy and a cash award of #200.

Ross Finlay admires the Eastern way of thinking
AS a middle-ranking Japanese manufacturer rather than one of the
giants, Mazda thinks about niche markets and not just about the big
sellers. That, as well as the current quota restrictions on
Japanese-built cars, explains why it imports a remarkable number of
completely different model lines here.
The 121 is a much more sophisticated ''town car'' than some. While the
original 121 has re-materialised as the Korean-built Kia Pride, the
present model takes the same high-roof approach which provides much
better passenger space than you might expect from its other dimensions.
This 1.3-litre #9800 supermini has decent performance as well as compact
size and manoeuvrability.
Mazda offers much more variety in the 323 range, which lists bodies
with three, four or five doors at prices from #11,895 to #17,495. It is
worth having a look at this car in side view, because it has a
remarkably long wheelbase in comparison with its bumper to bumper
length.
From #11,995 to #17,645, the current 626 is a considerable advance on
the previous model. The UK importers bring in five five-door hatchbacks
and one four-door saloon. The 626 provides the first flurry of unusual
engineering in the range, because one variant is a supercharged -- not
turbocharged -- diesel.
Japanese manufacturers are not generally applauded by design buffs for
their outstanding body shapes. However, Mazda has made a beautiful job
of its two faintly retro-look Xedos saloons. The Xedos 6 with 1.6 or V6
two-litre engine comes at prices from #16,675 to #20,995. I prefer the
more generous lines of the Xedos 9, which uses the silky-smooth V6
engine with a higher 2.5-litre capacity. Costing from #24,399, the Xedos
9 is a fine executive saloon which would certainly be paid more
attention if it came from, let us say Munich.
The MX-3 and MX-6 coupes are sold in modest numbers here, using body
styles which are not to everybody's taste. But I have met few sports car
fanciers who do not have one of the simple and very attractive MX-5 open
two-seaters on their imaginary shopping lists. While Mazda had a head
start over its British and European sports car rivals, it has not sat
still while the competition gathers. The 1.8-litre MX-5 costs from
#14,495, but next month there will be a base model with the original
1.6-litre engine at #12,995.
The MX-5 was designed right from the start to appeal to fans of the
classic European sports car, with rear wheel drive, a carefully selected
exhaust note, and what somebody I have always envied described as a
rifle-bolt gear change action. I am not surprised that it features in a
special exhibition at the Design Centre in London, running till the end
of next month.
Absolute top whack in performance terms within the Mazda range is the
tremendous RX-7 twin turbo rotary-engined sports coupe. Very few of
these #32,350 cars are sold in the UK, but Mazda has to be saluted for
being the only manufacturer in the world to persevere with the rotary
engine concept. Some engineers inwardly despise the conventional type of
engine in which the power is produced by pistons hurtling up and down
vertically, when that movement has to be transferred at the crankshaft
to round-and-round. The rotary engine works in a spinning movement
throughout. As a result, the RX-7 under full acceleration makes an
eerie, distinctive ''thrum''.
Mazda has done impressive work on full-scale catalysts for lean-burn
engines, and is developing a very convincing natural gas-powered
prototype. For the longer term, it has a concept vehicle powered by fuel
cells, which many researchers recognise as almost certainly the way
ahead. But Mazda's marketing intentions are not all concerned with niche
vehicles and designs for beyond the millenium. Late into the business of
European build programmes it may be, but next year it will be selling
its own version of the Fiesta.

Ruth Wishart meets Elaine C Smith, the sunny, cheerful performer with
a successful UK profile, and discovers there were many personal crises
to overcome before she found a place where she really wanted to be
For years, my father dealt with me by asking my mother how I was
doing. Now, sometimes, I force him to have a personal conversation
WE ARE talking late night at the top of Leith Walk in Edinburgh. Not
the most obviously discreet setting in which to tumble-dry some of the
more intimate domestic linen. But never underestimate the disinhibiting
effect of a small refreshment. Nor the verbal punching power of a woman
whose partner has just come up with an uncomfortably accurate insight.
So Bob says to Elaine: ''I'm fed up with all this. I don't want to
know you in ten years time still saying'I could have done this, or I
could have been that'. Do it or stop going on about it.''
Elaine's precise reply need concern us, not least in case her mammy
reads it. Suffice to say that the lady scurried home, sat down, and
wrote an impassioned job application to Dave McLennan of the Wildcat
Theatre company. Farewell Elaine, itinerant school drama teacher, hello
Elaine C Smith, multi-faced star of just about any medium you care to
shake a stick at.
Rob, now business partner, husband, and father of their two daughters
seems to have survived the transformation with some equanimity. Unless,
of course he and missus are arguing the toss about politics, of which
more later. And the girl herself is in fine good fettle, rehearsing all
the daytime hours God sends for the tour of the Tron production of
Dumbstruck with Forbes Masson and Jimmy Chisholm, fronting a BBC health
series called Bodycount, starring in a particularly hard-edged episode
of the current celebration of female writing Lambrusco Nights and
awaiting the fate of two network pilot shows.
Only The Lonely is that rare product from BBC Scotland's comedy unit,
a story with female protagonists. Surely some mistake, thought your
woman as she and Louise Beattie grabbed it with both hands and much
enthusiasm. ''I play a romantic type who runs a dating agency and thinks
everything always comes good in the end. Louise is a divorced mother of
three, bitter and cynical. We had great fun.''
''And Dumbstruck's been good for me too, since I usually get to play
the nice mumsie types and this time I'm the thug, a woman of a certain
age running theatrical digs in slightly faded silk pyjamas and still
convinved she's in her prime.''
That Ms Smith in real life is enjoying that happy state is not in
doubt. The Rab C. Nesbitt show gave her a UK profile, which may count in
her favour if the second pilot, made for Channel 4 by Wark Clements -- a
sort of gaun yersel' version of the ubiquitous chat show where studio
audiences cheerfully unzip their souls -- successfully beats off two
other challengers. She would, you feel, be inordinately good at it,
partly because her personality invites a warm response, and partly
because -- unlike her transatlantic counterparts -- it seems unlikely
she would use that natural expertise to exploit or gratuitously
embarrass her audience.
On paper, then, a woman who might make Midas feel positively
challenged in the gilt-edged department. But, like many superficially
sunny souls, particularly those with that eviable ability to move
audiences to laughter and tears within the same piece, she didn't reach
her her present success without slaying many personal demons.
The memorable Glasgow version of Shirley Valentine is a particular
case in point. She'd been lying in bed with shingles and an equally
serious dose of the ''What's it all about Alfies?'', when she and her
husband decided to drop a line to Willy Russell to check if Valentine
was available. Both personally and professionally, it proved a seminal
moment. ''The audiences, mainly women, made it very special. They might
have seen the film, but I think they needed to hear that message in
their own accent to be able to relate.''
The star of the show related only too well. ''It was an especially
emotional time for me, because my mother and father had split up after
35 years of marriage. And my mother had done the whole Shirley Valentine
bit, gone back and got her Highers, learned to drive, got a job first as
a nursery nurse and then in selling, and got herself a life basically.
So she decided to leave and walked out with her clothes and a few
personal things but not so much as a Hoover from all these years.''
At Bob's insistence she came to stay with them for a few months before
getting herself a flat. One of Smith's two younger sisters stayed with
the father, which she thinks proved crucial to his coping.
But nobody came out unscathed. ''I went into a real decline when it
happened; I was in a real bad way. I wasn't sure how it would work out
for anyone, including my mother. In fact, she said when Katie, our first
daughter, was born that it didn't just give her a new lease of life, it
gave her a reason to go on living.''
Smith remains steadfastly loyal to both parents, assuring you that she
loves both dearly. But it's clear that her father, a mechanical
engineer, suffered from that emotionally fatal disease which afflicts so
many Scotsmen -- of being unable to display affection or admit to needs
which they assume will be construed as weaknesses. So although, in
Smith's words, he ''ruled the roost'' his daughters all became aware of
the fragility behind the macho veneer.
''In some ways, the break up was the best thing that could have
happened to his relationship with his daughters because he really had to
make an effort. For years, he dealt with me by asking my mother how I
was doing and she sent all the birthday cards and that kind of thing.
Now, sometimes, I force him to have a personal conversation, yet the
next time we meet it's as if it never took place. It's very sad
really.''
''Yet I can remember back to when we were little and he was just the
best Dad ever. Full of fun, magical. My abiding memory of him is him
telling us stories as wee girls. There was no Jack and the Beanstalk
like my Dad's Jack and the Beanstalk.'' That easy intimacy disappeared
as the girls got older, and it would be idle to pretend re-creating it
is likely. My uncle, my mother's brother, told me that it's important to
remember the damage that was done to people growing up in hardship in
the thirties and forties. And I know he's right. I know too that my
father had a bad relationship with his own mother. So I was determined
to break out of that cycle.''
She has too. But not without doubts about handling her celebrity,
embarrassment at her financial good fortune, and fear that she might be
thought to be betraying staunchly working class origins which are
imbibed with the jeely pieces in erstwhile mining villages like
Newarthill. (Where a certain Liz Lochhead lived just around the corner).
She unpicked all that with the help of counselling: ''It took a while,
but in some senses it saved my life, it let me come to terms with it
all, and it left me in a place where I want to be.''
Or maybe we should say places where she wants to be, since the nine
months she took off having their youngest daughter Hannah, represent one
of the few periods in the few years where she's not seemed to have been
juggling several roles at once.
''So far as the girls are concerned we make it work because Bob is
terrific as is my mother and we have the help of a childminder. When we
went on the Nesbitt tour, I decided it would be selfish to take Katie
out of nursery school, as a result of which I cried solidly for the
first two days.
''But I rarely do more than one tour a year and I'm lucky in that most
of my work is just at the BBC and I'm home every night, and then of
course when I'm working in the theatre I'm around all day.''
The business is not her only concern. Not, she cheerfully concedes,
one of life's more natural joggers, she's nevertheless taken up fairly
serious running . . . a couple of miles a time at the moment, building
up to her pledge to compete in this year's women's 10 kilometres.
''Though I'm not just doing it for the obvious reasons of getting in
shape after a pregnancy and keeping fit, I actually needed it for sheer
stamina to get me through the kind of schedule I've had since
Christmas.''
She still holds passionate political convictions and doesn't rule out
an interest in parliament provided it's here in Scotland.
Her decision to join the Artists for Independence group at the time of
the last election resulted in a painful parting of the ways with the
Labour Party, but also taught her some valuable lessons about the
blacker political arts. ''We were just so naive. We didn't think how
easy it would be to be manipulated, and the media just ate us up.''
None of which has dissuaded her from taking up a similar stance next
time round. Someone once asked her if she had a dream and she confided
that Helena Kennedy as President of Scotland wouldn't be a bad start.
Elaine C Smith as Arts Minister wouldn't be a bad follow up.

ADDING a conservatory or garden room to the home is a delight,
bringing the obvious pleasures -- and some unexpected ones. It enables
you to bring the garden into the living room and to enjoy it all year
round, so that once the conservatory is established you will wonder how
you lived without it.
In summer it becomes the central focus of relaxation, and often of
gardening, as you can explore the possibilities of growing even the most
exotic tropical and subtropical plants, but summer is not the only
season of use for a conservatory in a cool-temperate climate. Provided
it is heated to some degree in winter, it is likely to become the
favourite room in the home all year round.
One of the unexpected benefits of growing plants in conservatories is
that they grow twice as well as they would in normal domestic
conditions, because of the great increase in available light. Many of
the plants which we grow today as houseplants were introduced in the
Victorian heyday of conservatories -- where they grew twice as well as
they do in any other room in the home.
The Victorians had a passion for foliage in their conservatories. Any
plant that was large, curiously shaped or unusually coloured was certain
to find a place under glass, and at that time there were plenty of
plants which fitted the bill being shipped home by plant hunters and
specialist botanical companies.
Serious plant hunting started in the 1600's when the Cecil family sent
their professional gardener John Tradescant to Europe to look for new
varieties of fruit and vegetables. He eventually became King Charles I's
gardener, after making many plant hunting expeditions to North Africa,
the Mediterranean coast, Greece and Russia. From early in the eighteenth
century and right through the nineteenth, plant hunters were sent by
their employers all over the world.
Alongside this thirst for exploration of the world and nature came the
technological achievements of the industrial revolution, among them the
combination of cast iron with glass to create an entirely new kind of
building. A method for manufacturing good sheet glass was perfected in
1833, and in 1845 a tax on glass which had been in place since the
seventeenth century was abolished. The price of glass nose-dived
overnight. The result was the construction of theatres, market halls --
such as Covent Garden -- and conservatories and winter gardens built
purely to house plants.
Timber continued to be used extensively for conservatory construction,
but cast and wrought iron were used for larger buildings. Because of its
combination of strength and flexibility, wrought iron was used to
manufacture delicate glazing bars to make them curved, improving both
the design possibilities and the entry of light. A great conservatory
was built at Chatsworth in the shape of a trefoil leaf in 1840 by Sir
Joseph Paxton, who went on to create his masterpiece -- the Crystal
Palace -- in Hyde Park in 1851 to cover the great exhibition. It was
later removed and rebuilt at Sydenham.
In 1845, a winter garden was made in Regent's Park. It was described
as ''a veritable fairyland, transplanted into the heart of London, where
the most exquisite odours wafted to and fro with every movement of the
glass doors.''
Much of this beauty and charm was destroyed by the First World War.
The price of coal soared, the gardeners became soldiers, and the plants
were untended. But in the last decade, conservatories have risen in
popularity. Now that leisure time is increasing, they are again
beginning to form an integral part of house design, as their many
advantages become apparent.
''Conservatories are once again being regarded as structures of
substance and beauty, mainly due to modern skills and techniques being
combined with traditional crafsmanship,'' said Philip Payne of
Killearn-based Cairn Conservatories. ''There are many ways of extending
one's home, but the most romantically satisfying is undoubtedly the
addition of a conservatory. Conservatories have always proved to be a
great balm to the human race, their gentle, calm atmosphere acting as a
soothing influence on people of all ages.''
Cairn uses a modular construction system and a computer-aided design
facility which allows the customer to benefit from the low costs
associated with economical standardised manufacture, whilst providing a
huge choice of layouts and formats.
The direction which a conservatory faces -- its aspect -- will have
some effect on its appearance. North facing conservatories and garden
rooms usually have proportionally more foliage plants, while south and
west facing conservatories allow you to grow more exotic flowering
plants. Some tropical flowers will thrive in a cooler conservatory --
several varieties of orchid, which would have to be grown in a warmer
conservatory, will do well in conservatories with a northerly aspect, if
brought in as fully grown plants.
Some conservatory owners simply grow a mixed collection of exotic
plants, often as a background to the furnishings, but it is perfectly
possible to use colour to blend, complement and contrast a variety of
shades and tints, to create a stunning setting in each season.

A confidence trick
JAMES SCOTT in his letter (March 7) disagrees with your editorial
(February 24), which had correctly stated: ''We should never forget that
the Scottish people did, in the referendum of 1979, vote specifically
for change.''
Mr Scott also writes: ''If even 40% of the Scottish people had voted
for change in 1979, we would have an assembly today, but a majority of
67.6% declined to vote for change and Labour's assembly collapsed.''
He asserts that there is no real proof of a current desire by Scots
for constitutional change.
Does he not know of the ever increasing SNP following? Is he unaware
that a Unionist Labour Party was forced into its Scottish parliament
proposals, along with its ridiculous sop for its English followers, by
the pressure brought to bear upon it by the Scottish Labour voter along
with the fear of massive losses to the SNP cause?
The 1979 referendum was an insult to human intelligence, and was,
without a doubt, one huge confidence trick. It was certainly unworthy of
any self-styled democracy. Mr Scott surely must be aware that the number
of Scots who actually voted for change did in fact exceed the number
wishing to retain the status quo out of the total number of Scots who
voted with their feet.
The 67.6% of the Scottish voters who, he declares, ''declined to vote
for change'' were split into each of four categories. First, those who
voted ''No'' to devolution out of principle but who were in a minority
to those who had voted ''Yes''.
Included therein were many who voted ''No'' because of the extremely
unsatisfactory and ambiguous terms of the referendum, which were couched
to give infantile powers to the Scots.
There were also the large number of Scots who had not considered it
worth while to vote and whose names had not been crossed off the
electoral register at the polling booth. They were ingeniously counted
as though they had actually voted ''No''.
Among the latter were the names of persons who had departed this life
before the register could be amended, initiating a remarkable precedent
whereby departed Scots were able to mark their cross from beyond the
grave.
A referendum held recently in each of the nations of Denmark, Ireland,
and Norway gave the electorate of these countries a simple choice of
''Yes'' or ''No'' to one single straightforward question.
The majority vote out of the total who had actually voted won the day.
The uninterested and the dead were not counted. That is what I would
consider the hallmark of a true democracy.

SCOTTISH Natural Heritage has hitherto stood aside from the media
coverage of the proposed Lingerabay superquarry in the belief that such
important and complex matters are more properly dealt with in the
current public inquiry.
I do, however, feel that some of the recent comments so misrepresent
SNH's position that I need to put the record straight.
SNH has always made it clear that the impacts the proposed superquarry
might have on the marine environment, while profoundly important, are
not the principal grounds for its objection. These relate to its effect
on the landscape of a National Scenic Area.
We have, indeed, drawn attention to the risks that might arise from
ballast water discharges and shipping accidents. We retain our concerns
on these issues and are therefore pleased that they have been addressed
at some length in the public inquiry.
While disagreeing with the interpretation placed upon the evidence in
some reporting, we are confident the Secretary of State's decision will
accord the matter the careful and balanced attention it deserves.

THE German government in Bonn has said it will not be able to comply
with European Union rules aimed at achieving a general resumption of
British beef exports to Germany. Many of the 16 regional states have
declared their belief that EU regulations aimed at curbing fears over
''mad cow disease'' offer consumers insufficient protection from the
risk of BSE -- bovine spongiform encephalitis.
The Upper House of Parliament, which represents the states, would have
to give approval to a directive from the Bonn government clearing the
import of British beef and has made it clear it will not give that
approval.
The EU has ruled that British cattle born after 1992 are free of BSE
and may be imported but six regional states have imposed import bans.
They claim that there is no proof that BSE cannot be transmitted to
humans. The European Commission has threatened to take action against
Bonn for failing to implement European law.

I DO not think Paul Scott (March 4) can reasonably level the charge of
propaganda at Professor George Clark's The Later Stuarts and who
concludes that settlement of the union ''became so much the accepted
basis of political life that there is little meaning in the question
whether it was justified by success''.
He adds: ''There never was at any time in the eighteenth or nineteenth
centuries anything remotely resembling a practical alternative. The
union was no more good or bad than the law of gravitation.''

THE staff at Phoenix Honda not only occupy state of the art
facilities, (rumoured to provide the model for future Honda dealership
design), they also handle one of the best ranges from any mainstream
manufacturer.
Honda's recent split from its long-time partnership with Rover has
given the company carte blanche to tackle the British market with the
gloves off.
Having created a solid reputation for innovation and quality over a
number of years, the new drive is to step up the dazzling technological
programme, but without pricing models out of their present market
sectors.
No easy task, as Rover has already discovered, but Honda's massive
world-wide strength gives it an edge over most of its competitors.
The first warning shots were fired last year when the Civic Coupe was
launched. Unlike every other coupe it sold for LESS than the model it
was based upon.
The result was predictable. It immediately began to sell like hot
cakes. Much the same trick will be repeated this month when the latest
batch of Civics, the five doors, are announced.
Packed with equipment many other manufacturers list as extras, they
will again offer customers more car for the least amount of money.
The Civics, together with the even higher specification Accord saloon,
estate and coupe models will form the spearhead of Honda's drive to
secure more fleet business in this country.
At the top of the range, the Prelude 2.0 and 2.3 litre coupes have
already become established as stylish, fast, safe and comfortable
vehicles for drivers who demand leading edge design with no compromises.
Prices? Take #17,000 and #19,000 as a base and look for any comparable
coupes offering anything like as much for a similar amount of cash. Just
don't spend too much time on this exercise. It won't bear much fruit.
Add the executive expresses bearing the Legend and Legend Coupe badges
and the picture is almost complete.
In fact it would be, but for the hugely impressive NSX sports car.
Driving one of the first examples to come into this country I declared
it the best two seater in the world. Just one other car, the Dodge
Viper, has come along in the interim to challenge this opinion, but in
typical Honda fashion the NSX has since been improved yet again.
Phoenix Honda will this year become the sole Scottish NSX dealer. The
first of the new models is expected around May, so make sure you get a
close look at the car the Italians wish THEY had built.
But before then it will be business as usual at Linwood, where Honda
owners can take advantage of a first class sales and service facility
that meets and -- in many respects -- exceeds the specification laid
down by one of the most demanding car manufacturers in the world.
Courtesy cars? Naturally. Phoenix Honda has invested a huge sum of
money in these -- and plans to replace them every six months. No
moth-eaten old stock from the back of the used car lot here.
Service while you fly off on business? Of course. Drop off your car
and be delivered to the airport and your car will be waiting when you
get back.
It will also be fettled in a squeaky-clean workshop fully equipped
with high-tech diagnostic equipment. The technicians who work on it are
highly and continuously trained, and fiercely proud of the standards to
which they work.
In other words, this is tomorrow's car dealership today.

ANDREW YOUNG finds echoes of Judy Garland in the girl from Easterhouse
TERRY Neason has become a lot of different things to a lot of people,
having developed in a variety of directions since she left Wildcat.
She is singer, actress, poet, songwriter and jazz musician.
Scotland will be seeing a lot of her this year. Her show, Over the
Rainbow, backed by an 18-piece orchestra, is to be a flagship event of
this year's Mayfest, going into the King's Glasgow, from May 10 to 14.
She will then take it to the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, for one night,
May 16.
She is currently making her London one-woman show debut, at the Lyric
Theatre, Hammersmith, with a compilation called Screams and Kisses. This
will be followed by three weeks in April in the main theatre of the
Citizens' with Wild and Wet Ones.
With the Paragon Ensemble at Mayfest, she will be having her biggest
musical backing so far. ''So I'll be able to roar my guts out, not be
frightened of blowing the band off stage,'' she says.
Apart from which, what will be different this time? ''It will be new,
it will be sexy, very high camp, darling. I have designed some frocks
that should be quite stunning. Might even get a pair of sparkly Doc
Martins to give me some street cred.''
She will be delivering a mixture of material, of love and passion, the
whole range, from a whisper to a belter with all valves open with songs
from Sondheim to Sunset oulevard.
There will be Kurt Weill's Mack the Knife from The Threepenny Opera,
and Pirate Jenny, which she has always wanted to do. And there will be a
lot of Judy Garland in the second half. ''I totally identify with that
voice. It's so incredibly emotional.''
Neason has built up a very personal following, is likely to be a
personal friend of a high percentage in any given audience. Now she is
getting an additional boost at the box office as a kind of cult figure
among male gays. A new camp following, inherited to an extent from Judy
Garland for whom the title of the show is a tribute.
It is a fact of life that was brought home to her with a vengeance
when she was doing Piaf, another character, vulnerable and powerful, at
the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh.
''At the end of the show, a leather-clad gentleman left his party, ran
down the centre aisle and threw a bouquet. It hit me and nearly knocked
me out. I landed on the stage. I'd heard about throwing a flower before
. . .
''I think they like me because of the kind of raw emotion they feel.
And there is the expression: 'Are you one of Dorothy's friends?' --
Dorothy, the little girl played by Judy in Wizard of Oz. There was also
Peter's Friends when Stephen Fry's character came out.''
Paul Bassett, Mayfest's director, had seen the Neason ability to fill
a theatre when he managed the Citz and persuaded her to bring something
special to this year's event.
She had her doubts until he made it clear that he wanted her as one of
the main attractions and was prepared to spend money on the kind of show
she wanted to do.
''I think it is important. In the past they have concentrated on
international work. And, within reason, yes Mayfest should be an
international festival. But the wonderful thing about Paul is he is
prepared to present the creme de la creme of Scotland,'' she says.
''This is good because it makes visitors coming in more aware of what
Scotland has to offer. It's getting rid of the old thing about not being
a prophet in your own land.''

Freetown, Tuesday
SIERRA Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front said today that
attacks by foreign troops fighting for the government side had stopped
them carrying out a planned handover of foreign captives.
The rebels are holding at least 16 foreigners, including VSO worker
Calum Murray from Lewis, his colleague Robert d'Souza, and five other
Britons.
The rebels have called for the withdrawal of Nigerian and other
foreign forces from Sierra Leone before they will consider peace talks
with the government.
''The RUF is sorry to inform the international community and the
families and friends of the foreign nationals under its care that their
handing over, originally scheduled to be on March 15, cannot take place
now,'' said RUF spokesman Alimamy Sankoh in a statement faxed to news
agencies in Abidjan.
''This is owing to constant air raids and heavy artillery bombardments
by foreign forces deployed by the military junta,'' the statement added.
It did not specify who would receive the captives, but in January the
RUF handed over a Russian and a Sierra Leonean to the Red Cross on the
border with Guinea.
The rebels accuse Britain of complicity in the presence of Gurkhas
demobilised from the British Army who are training Sierra Leonean troops
in guerrilla and jungle warfare.--Reuter.

A GOOD solid profit advance was what the market had been expecting
from Williams Holdings and it got just that yesterday.
The building products, security products, and fire protection group,
advanced 30.7% at the pre-tax level last year from #153.2m to #200.3m.
At the operating level there was a 12.4% increase to #215.3m. A final
dividend of 8.25p takes the total to 13.5p, a rise of 7.7%.
This increase is below the 13% rise to 21.8p in adjusted earning per
share in line with the company's policy of progressively rebuilding
dividend cover. The results, which include an improvement in cash flow
and lower gearing, left the shares barely changed at 319p.
Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams, said the figures ''demonstrated the
benefits of focusing the group on three core business areas.''
The company is confident about future progress. Conditions continue to
improve in its main European and US markets and Williams intends
pressing ahead with expanding the core businesses, organically and
through acquisitions.

THIS is entirely the wrong time of year to do much more than skip over
the doings of the motor trade.
After all, Scottish new car registrations tumbled by almost nine per
cent in January and weren't much better in February, so it can be
assumed good cheer is in short supply.
Or is it? Enter Phoenix Honda. With just under two years in the
business, the Linwood-based dealership has set the trade on its ear
courtesy of a breathtaking performance that has taken its turnover to a
staggering #11m per annum. This was achieved during a non-stop run of
success as carefully planned as it has been audacious.
Honda UK has certainly been impressed. So much so that Phoenix,
following a total re-organisation of the prestigious NSX network, will
be the only authorised Scottish outlet for Honda's flagship sports
model.
This is some achievement, given that Phoenix is a true family
business, not just a satellite of a massive group.
It is headed by John McGuire, whose apprenticeship in the trade
included spells with two of the best in the business, Ian Skelly and
Arnold Clark.
Later came a rather different and not quite so happy type of lesson,
working within the Octav Botnar-led Nissan UK network.
It was at this time that John McGuire experienced the frustration of
seemingly being in charge of his own destiny, but in fact being at the
end of decisions taken elsewhere.
Hence the resolve to set up as an independent, but where and with what
franchise?
''At this time there was a glaring gap in the Honda UK network centred
on Paisley,'' he said. ''For some reason or other the company hadn't
been represented in the town for over 15 years, so the potential was
obvious, especially since the opening of Phoenix Retail Park provided
access to land which hadn't been available in the area before.
''We have plenty of parking space, room for expansion as and when
necessary, excellent motorway access and we are handily situated for the
airport.''
The Phoenix plan target for its first year was to sell 110 new cars.
Opening in August 1993, it sold over 200 by the end of December that
year.
The 1994 target was realistically set at 170, but 345 units were sold.
This added up to 203% on target, making the company the top performing
dealer in the UK.
To put this into some sort of perspective, these results were achieved
without the benefit of an existing customer base. John McGuire wryly
recalls that research into the number of Honda cars being operated in
his franchise area revealed just sixteen in July 1993.
So not only was the overall trend bucked, but by a brand new
dealership literally starting from scratch.
The impetus has been maintained too, with Phoenix doubling its new car
sales in January and simultaneously recording a healthy increase in used
car business.
John McGuire is naturally delighted with the progress to date, but he
professes to be even happier that the efforts of his staff have been
noted elsewhere.
''Just a few months after opening we won the Honda Team Challenge
Trophy, for sales and the quality of after-sales,'' he said. ''This
takes into account the performance of every dealership in Britain, so we
were delighted to have made our mark so soon.
''The quality of after-sales service is something Honda sees as very
important given that the company consistently achieves the highest
levels in the business. We are very proud of our own contribution in
this field.
''Last year we had a visit from Mr Honda and Mr Ishino (Honda UK
Managing Director), who presented us with another two major awards. One
was for being the top Honda dealer in Britain and the other was for
achieving the top customer service index rating.''
Another five major awards have been secured since then, so there has
to be some sort of secret somewhere that can explain how and why so much
has been achieved in such a short timespan.
John McGuire's early experience in the motor trade taught him that you
have to build carefully from the first brick. The staff at Phoenix Honda
are hand picked.
''By and large they were people I had worked with in the past -- or
was married to,'' he said. ''The family ties are obvious. There are
three directors, including myself, my cousin James Devenney and Ian
Wood, a long-standing friend from my Arnold Clark days.
''Add my aunt, father, two cousins and, of course, my wife Kate who
does all the sales administration. This means any problems can be
identified quickly and the ensuing dialogue is always constructive. It
also gives a team involvement which isn't often found elsewhere.''
It also means that Phoenix customers are immediately drawn into all of
this, becoming an extension to the family group.
The company is also involved in a number of sponsorship deals, notably
with Celtic Football Club (Honda UK supplies the other half of the Old
Firm with cars), St. Mirren FC and Greenock Morton FC.
Having demonstrated a remarkable ability to supply the type of service
customers require -- and then to top it -- can the Phoenix staff keep it
up? Given the manner by which the company has been structured the answer
has to be in the affirmative.

COUNCILLOR Murray's letter takes my comment about male Labour
councillors in Kyle and Carrick out of context (March 11).
It is appalling to my mind that the Labour Party has turned its back
on party stalwarts when it comes to the selection of a parliamentary
candidate, men who have promoted the party interests, albeit at the
expense of my constituents.
It does mean that whoever is selected as the woman candidate for Ayr
constituency will have a question mark over her head with respect to
being the best candidate available.
I consider it to be an insult to women in general that the Labour
Party in Ayr sees that left-wing political correctness is put above the
interests of the electorate of Ayr.
I have to say that the contributions of the Kyle and Carrick women
Labour councillors hardly give cause for confidence.
It is worthy of note that Councillor Murray has so little confidence
in retaining the electors' support in her regional seat that she has
swopped to the other end of the constituency for the new local authority
elections.

PROFESSOR Jack Shaw, the first executive director of Scottish
Financial Enterprise, is returning to the fold as chairman.
He will succeed Sir Alick Rankin, who is stepping down after a
three-year term at the helm of the private sector body which promotes
the interests of Scotland's respected financial community.
The changeover will take place at SFE's annual general meeting on
April 24.
Professor Shaw, 62, who is deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland,
was instrumental in the establishment of SFE in 1986.
Sir Alick, 60, said: ''There can be few people better qualified than
Jack Shaw to take over the chairmanship of Scottish Financial
Enterprise. It was he who did most to create this entity.''
Professor Shaw, a past president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, left SFE in 1990.
He expressed ''surprise and delight at having been thought able to
contribute again in a totally different way at a totally different
time''.
The consideration of the European monetary union and Scottish
devolution issues are near the top of Professor Shaw's agenda.
A former senior partner of accountancy firm Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells,
Professor Shaw is currently a board member of Scottish Enterprise, as
well as chairman of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and of
the European League for Economic Co-operation's monetary panel.
SFE executive director Grant Baird said Professor Shaw's abilities,
intellectual weight and reputation would be invaluable.

<HEADLINE>Major misses horror of Gaza slums as aid aims to ease Palestinian plight</HEADLINE>

Gaza, Tuesday,
THE Prime Minister today escaped the full slum horrors of a refugee
camp in this precious 20 sq mile strip of Palestine ruled by Yasser
Arafat. A 12-year-old boy was shot by mistake by the police in the camp
he was due to visit.
It was a striking example of what 900,000 Arabs endure -- two-thirds
of them refugees.
Mr Major had arrived with a phalanx of top British businessmen to try
to give them hope that an end may come to their suffering.
The problem of a tiny state with no infrastructure was described Mr
Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, as ''frightening''. Mr Odin
Knudsen from the World Bank said: ''It is like building a boat in the
middle of the ocean in the middle of a storm.''
Lord Sterling told the Palestinians at a candid meeting: ''Tell us
what you want and we'll do it. If you want a hospital, we'll build it,
if you want a port we can do that too. But tell us what you want
quickly.''
Yasser Arafat is receiving #400m in world aid a year, but it is all
draining away. Because terrorism has forced the Israelis to close the
borders of Gaza, #1.3m in earnings a day is lost. As the peace process
in the Middle East drags on, the plight of Gaza worsens.
In 90 minutes of talks the Prime Minister and the chairman of the PLO
tried to assemble a plan to stop the terrorism blighting his people.
They emerged for a press conference at which Mr Arafat and the Prime
Minister passionately called for an end to the violence.
Mr Arafat extended his plea to Northern Ireland. ''I am encouraging
all the partners here and in Ireland and everywhere to firm up the peace
process. I am supporting the initiative of your Prime Minister and the
Prime Minister of Ireland.''
However he stopped short of calling on Gerry Adams to persuade the IRA
to hand over their weapons. ''I am not giving lessons to anyone, but I
am supporting this peace process.''
Mr Major is trying to please both sides of the argument here. He
devoted the day to the problem of the occupied territories which
Britain, under UN Resolution 242, demands that the Israelis should hand
back. So he went to Gaza, a 19-mile strip of land on the Mediterranean
to talk to Mr Arafat, then returned to Jerusalem where Palestinians from
the West Bank and the Arab east of the city were coming to see him in
the British Consulate.
He was also reporting back to the Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin, with
whom he had spent the previous day. The Israelis will not lift the
border restrictions with Gaza until the terrorism stops. Mr Arafat does
not have the means to achieve this. There is still no sign of an end to
this impasse.
Mr Major went to the northern border at Erez by helicopter then
transferred to Mr Arafat's motor cavalcade. They sped into Gaza City
through streets lined with armed police and soldiers, Union Jacks
mingling with the Palestinian flag.
At Arafat's offices there was a parade of his meagre regular forces
and a rendering of God Save the Queen by bagpipers of a Scout troop from
Bethlehem. The PLO chairman, in Western clothes apart from his trademark
Arab headdress, saluted the National Anthem.
Before their talks Mr Major visited a nursing college and a police
station where he met two officers from Nottingham, Tony Houldsworth and
Jim Price. They have brought riot gear from the UK to teach the
Palestinian police how to control crowds without resorting to their AK47
and M16 rifles.
PC Houldsworth said: ''I like to call myself a riot prevention officer
here. We have to teach these people how to handle trouble from crowds
without shooting them.''
The Prime Minister brought another #7m in British aid to Gaza,
bringing the total to #82m. He insisted that the Israelis must address
one of the biggest problems -- the settlements they have allowed their
own people to build in Gaza.
He declared: ''Under the Declaration of Principles (an agreement
struck by Arafat and Rabin) it is perfectly clear that there should be
no more settlement activity.''
The Israelis dispute the undertaking in the declaration, but Mr Major
apparently felt it necessary to give Mr Arafat political as well as
economic support on this visit.
In Jerusalem he was talking to the Palestinians about an even more
difficult problem -- the city of Jerusalem itself, which the Arabs
insist should be returned to them. The Israelis refuse to give up even
east Jerusalem, where the main number of Palestinians live.
The Prime Minister said: ''We acknowledge the factors and we believe
that it's something that has to be resolved in final status
negotiations.''
Tonight the Prime Minister arrived in the Jordanian capital Amman for
talks with King Hussein on Arab-Israeli peace and other issues.
* US Secretary Warren Christopher announced that Israel and Syria will
resume direct talks on the fate of the Golan Heights within the next few
days. The talks were broken off last December and for hours today it
seemed as if the deal to reopen them would fall apart.
Mr Christopher, evidently relieved to announce the move, said his
six-day tour of the region had been ''one of the most satisfying trips I
have made to the Middle East''.

FOLLOWING the reported proposals from the Church of Scotland Assembly
Council that central church funding should be withdrawn from the
majority of the church's industrial chaplains and from the Society,
Religion, and Technology Project, the questions are once again sharply
raised -- how does the Church of Scotland see its mission being promoted
in Scotland today, and on what basis does it evaluate its spending
priorities?
With 15,000 members per year for the past 15 years haemorrhaging from
its traditional congregations and widespread evidence of deepening
spiritual hunger in the country at large, these are clearly questions
that will be asked not solely within the church; many in the wider life
of the nation will be deeply concerned.
In particular, many outwith the church as well as church members will
expect to see the careful theological and evangelical analysis of the
comparative effectiveness of the work of industrial chaplains and the
Society, Religion, and Technology Project, in relation to the work of
the traditional ministry, which has presumably led to the making of
these proposals.
Otherwise I suggest it will be almost impossible for the church to
avoid the charge that the cuts are being made primarily on financial
grounds and that leadership in the church is, chiefly speaking and
despite all disclaimers to the contrary, out of a fear of change and an
instinct for survival.
Such charges, if made, are I believe unfair in the main. There is a
growing vision of a new way of being the church and doing mission in
Scotland today -- a way which, for example, wil be lay led, no longer
dependent on the presence of paid full-time or part-time ministers in
every parish.
But while this vision is being developed and, hopefully, grasped by
the church and people in Scotland, it is surely unwise, not to say
unfaithful, to withdraw from missionary activity in industry and in the
world of technology, activity that has been undertaken with such
imagination by the church in sectors of society which are so often
untouched by normal church activity.

THERE has been extensive coverage of the wind-up of the UN operation
in Somalia. Invariably this UN operation has been described as a
failure, as well as an astronomically costly one.
As chief executive of Concern Worldwide, I appealed for intervention
in 1992, and welcomed and arrival of the US forces. I wish to distance
myself from the chorus of glib criticism of an operation which helped
save many thousands of the most helpless from painful death by
starvation.
The US marines landed on the beaches of Somalia in December, 1992,
amid publicity which was not of their making. The situation in Somalia
at that time was crying out to heaven. There were thousands of tons of
food in the port of Mogadishu. In Baidoa, some 150 miles away (one of
the places where Concern was operational), people were starving to death
in their hundreds daily.
Each morning saw the collection of hundreds of bodies like so many
bags of rubbish. The horrific situation had been building up since late
summer, 1992, despite the best endeavours of aid agencies.
At the time the US was the only force with the capability and state of
preparedness to do what was crying out to be done -- confront the
bullies and save the starving. They did so under a UN mandate. They did
open ports and airports. They did contribute hugely to the saving of
many thousands of lives. In due course they handed on the UN baton to
the forces of the other countries.
It is gratifying that there are many people alive in Somalia who would
not be alive but for the intervention of the US, the UN, and so many aid
agencies. But much that is good and normal and giving grounds for hope
is going on at present. For example, the crops in many areas are
promising. In the past week we had reports from the local committees now
running schools rebuilt and refurbished and for two years run by
Concern.
The US and UN were by no means a failure. In the name of the many
thousands of temporarily helpless people in many countries who continue
to need outside assistance to survive and get back on their feet, let us
tread warily.
This may mean battling grandiose ''development'' theories, not
subscribing to absolute notions of sacred sovereignty, not subscribing
to the universally disproved notion that those in power prioritise the
needs of the poor and the weak.
God grant that the gunmen of Somalia will fade from the stage and that
the Somali people be allowed to live in peace.

JIMMY ALLISON's ''dismissal'' was indeed a major blow to the Labour
Party and the end of an era. I, too, was present throughout the Govan
campaign and feel that Jimmy's criticism of the Walworth Road spin
doctors did not go far enough.
My own report, on behalf of Sogat, was submitted to Jimmy Allison and
made this point. Many in the Labour Party can hang their heads in shame
at the treatment of Bob Gillespie.
I recall when he lost the Cathcart nomination by the narrowest of
margins. Sogat sent in a team of workers to ensure that John Maxton took
the seat from Teddy Taylor. None worked harder than Bob Gillespie.
In Govan he faced hostility from virtually all of the media, including
those papers nominally for Labour, from day one.
Given the volatile nature of by-elections and the high-profile SNP
candidate, it is probable Labour would have lost in any case. In the
aftermath of Govan, Sillars took up part-time work with the Sun while
Bob Gillespie continued to work for better conditions for men and women
in the print industry and kept a dignified silence as Jimmy Allison has
acknowledged.
I would like to refer to his comment that ''Sogat would not be unhappy
to see Bob Gillespie go''. This remark is attributed to a former Sogat
officer.
As president of Bob Gillespie's branch and a former member of Sogat's
National Executive Council, I am quite unaware of any such feeling in
our union. This chestnut did circulate at the time, among other
nonsense.
Bob Gillespie has been an outstanding officer of this union over a
long period, serving in many capacities. He has also made a major
contribution in the wider Labour movement.
He was the recent recipient of a special gold badge, which I was
honoured to present.
Parliament's loss (and Govan's loss) was our gain.
How sad that other socialists should arouse such ire in the new Labour
Party.

STERLING moved higher with the dollar in late European trading but was
unable to hold on to earler gains following publication of a downbeat
CBI retail report. This appears to rule out the need for an early rise
in UK interest rates.
''The bottom line is that UK interest rates are probably on hold for
the time being,'' said Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ
International.
Domestic political uncertainty following the row between the US and UK
governments over the handling of Sinn Fein and the Northern Ireland
issue was also cited as a reason for the pound's erratic movements.
Against a mark which succumbed to some profit-taking, sterling was
lower at DM2.2431. Despite falling to a record low of DM2.2155 on
Monday, it is thought possible that the pound could recover to DM2.2650
provided it consolidates at its current level.
Against the dollar, sterling lost almost a cent to $1.5875 but its
trade weighted index remained at 85.3.

I WAS angered by the factually incorrect and antagonistic article,
Pouring oil over troubled waters (March 9). I have been a windsurfer for
over 10 years and have regularly sailed on Loch Lomond.
I have found that most water skiers are family groups out to enjoy the
natural resources in much the same way as I, a sailor, do. They neither
''rampage unhindered'' nor worry wildlife, as James Freeman suggests.
On the contrary, I have regularly seen water skiers and speedboat
owners come to the assistance of inexperienced sailors or those who have
had difficulties. I myself am in debt to one owner who rescued me during
a Force 5 when my mast had broken.
Many of the water skiers I know to be members of the national
governing body, the Scottish Water Ski Association, which encourages
safe, responsible practice through education, just as the RYA does for
sailing.
Rather than waste a page on such biased unconstructive criticism,
perhaps you could outline the responsible practices that should be
adopted by all water users, power and sailing craft of all types, to
ensure the highest degree of safety possible on our beautiful loch.
In the meantime many water skiers and powerboat users disagree not
with the regulation of the use of the loch, but the specific regulations
that would unfairly discriminate against beginner water skiers and ski
racers.

THIS story starts and ends with a concert. In between, it travels an
unusual, partly uncharted path: a journey across two centuries and
several continents, between staggering opulence and war-ravaged ruin,
between conspicuous consumption and abject poverty.
And, most curiously of all, this story records an advert in the
Edinburgh Evening Courant of January, 1784, an advert whose
ramifications triggered a renaissance in imperial Russia and changed
forever the architectural face of that country.
To begin with, the concert; on Saturday, March 25th, Scotland's own
international piano trio, the Rachmaninov trio -- which consists of two
Russians and an American -- will give a recital in St Bride's Scottish
Episcopal Church in Glasgow. It is a fund-raising recital, and the group
will donate the entire proceeds to the poor and hungry of St Sofia's
Cathedral in Tsarskoe Selo, near St Petersburg -- formerly Leningrad.
The concert will coincide with the climax of a visit to Scotland by
Father Gennady Zverev, Archpriest of St Sofia's Cathedral. By any
definition, the Archpriest is an extraordinary man. Six years ago, as
perestroika took hold and the Soviet regime began to collapse, Zverev
led a group of Russian orthodox Christians back to what were the ruins
of St Sofia, at one time one of the architectural jewels of imperial
Russia.
Over the Soviet decades the cathedral had been systematically
desecrated and ravaged. The communists had allowed the grounds to become
a rubbish dump. The cathedral had been hammered -- though not destroyed
-- by the Germans as they withdrew following the siege of Leningrad: the
pillars are today still pock-marked with bullet holes. And what was left
of the church was turned into an incinerator.
Only since Father Zverev's return to St Sofia has reclamation and
rebuilding begun. He and his colleagues doggedly pursue this task
alongside a full programme of pastoral duties with a broad congregation
that embraces convicts and hundreds of alcoholics, as well as the
desperately hungry in an area constantly in crisis over lack of
supplies. In this work, he is supported by a group of five Scottish
charities.
The restoration programme for the cathedral moves at a speed dictated
by the availability of materials. Cement is virtually unobtainable, so
Zverev and his aides pound the stones of the ruins, remixing the
powdered mortar. That is a story in itself.
But what they are reconstructing, the magnificent St Sofia Cathedral,
built at the instruction of the Empress Catherine the Great, was, in
fact, the work of a Scot, Charles Cameron, whose name has been borrowed
by the five supporting Scottish charities, which have formed a
collective known as the Cameron Foundation.
In brief, Cameron -- who claimed to be a refugee Jacobite -- had been
invited to Russia by Catherine. She had read his work on Roman Bath
Houses and, in the words of one authority, ''was hoovering up Europe for
anything cultural''.
His first commission from Catherine was the rebuilding of part of the
Catherine Palace at Tsarskoe Selo -- ''the Tsar's Village'' -- which
lies south of St Petersburg. A whole series of projects followed,
including a Chinese village, the sumptuous Palace of Pavlovsk -- his
masterpiece -- and his only church, the Cathedral of St Sofia.
And it is here that the Scottish dimension broadens. During the work
on his first commission, Cameron had problems with Russian workers. Not
just in the language, but in the craft. Catherine wanted her buildings
in a neo-classical style, and in stone. The Russians habitually worked
in wood.
So Cameron took out an advert in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of
January 15, 1784 requesting specialist craftsmen to come and work in
Russia. In May that year, 76 masons, smiths, bricklayers and plasterers
sailed for Russia to be met by Cameron. Their arrival changed the face
of Russian architecture.
Their impact and influence persists to this day. ''Those who followed
in Cameron's footsteps, and on that boat, included some of the first
town planners and the greatest designers and engineers of the day,''
said David Martin of the Cameron Foundation.
''When you walk down Nevsky Prospekt in St Petersburg today, you're
still walking across bridges designed by a Scottish engineer. When you
go into the Great Square of the Winter Palace and look up at the
angel-dominated monument, the iron work on it was produced by a man from
Falkirk.
''When you look at St Isaac's Cathedral -- the second biggest in the
world -- at its domes, its pillars, its ornamentation, and the rafters
it sits on; all were produced by a Scot.''
And their presence and influence spread. One stonemason recruited by
Cameron moved on to design and build, first in Moscow, then in the Gulf
of Finland where he designed several palaces. Another was appointed
chief architect to the southern regions of Russia, and pioneered the
technology to span bridges with cast iron. The astonishing Scottish
story rolls right across Russia.
Of the original 76 craftsmen, some had taken their wives. Others -- as
did Cameron himself -- met and married Russian women. On his forthcoming
visit to Scotland, Archpriest Gennady Zverev will be accompanied by one
of his lay assistants, who rejoices in the name Vladimir Thomson.
Thomson, who apparently has a passion for Irish and Scottish folk
music, has never been out of Russia, and, until recently when he was
informed otherwise by David and Christine Martin of the Cameron
Foundation, believed his name was of English origin. The Martins --
passionate Russophiles -- have unearthed the original passenger list of
that ship that took the 76 craftsmen to Russia. Two of them were called
Thomson.
The Scottish influence comes home this week when, during their visit
to Scotland, which begins this Friday, Archpriest Zverev and Vladimir
Thomson will undertake a hectic schedule that includes meetings with
Scottish church leaders, ecumenical services, visits to prisons, to drug
and alcohol units, and to homes for children and the elderly.
The trip culminates in the charity concert in St Bride's where the
phenomenally gifted Rachmaninov Trio will play music by Brahms,
Schumann, and Rachmaninov to raise money that will go back with Zverev
and Thomson, directly to the hungry of St Sofia.
* Rachmaninov Trio concert: St Bride's, Hyndland Rd, Sat March 25 at
7.30pm. All tickets #5. Available on door or through TicketLink, 0141
227 5511

THERE are no angels in the fishing business. It is a hard affair in
which the economics of survival, and the dangers to human survival, are
taken in the balance daily. It is an emotive business; like miners,
fishermen have a special place in the public affection because they have
a dangerous and dirty job where lives have been sacrificed for the
gathering of essential resources. Unfortunately it is also a business
where posturing, lying, and cheating and the most blatant manipulation
of national feelings is taken as the acceptable way to behave. The
escalating dispute between Canada and the European Union over the arrest
by Canada of a Spanish fishing vessel in international waters is a case
in point. The rights and wrongs of this issue are hopelessly confused.
The Canadians have struggled to protect their fishing areas and have
largely banned their own ships in an attempt to allow the stocks of fish
to regenerate naturally. They argue that, as fish are no respecters of
demarcation lines drafted by man, they have a right to protect fish
stocks adjacent to the protected areas and have passed a law in Canada
to enable this belief.
There are two things wrong with this way of proceeding. If lines have
to be drawn internationally, but the areas alongside them are argued to
be of equal importance, where does the process of national jurisdiction
end? In theory the Canadians appear to suggest that any area of
international waters in which they have an environmental and commercial
interest can be policed and administered by the Canadian armed forces.
This is a preposterous notion, and while the theory of protecting
fragile fish stocks is acceptable, the method of doing it is not. Nor do
the Canadians have a halo to polish, with or without the aid of fish
oil. As we report elsewhere in this newspaper this morning, some
Canadian fisheries experts are unimpressed with their own fishing
standards. Canadian fishing stocks are in a perilous situation because
Canada took part in the hoovering process willingly. Nor has it stopped,
as the plight of the shrimp, turbot, cod, and immature mullet stocks off
Labrador, fished to the point of real danger to species, illustrates
only too clearly.
Spanish fishermen are regularly demonised, and rightly so. They
disregard rules and frequently gather fish with illegal nets. The
ownership of their vessels is often a carefully contrived nightmare
designed to baffle the authorities, and their attitude to immature fish,
like the Greenland halibut which they fish with utter disregard for the
future of stocks, is a disgrace. They prey on fish and they prey on less
fortunate fellow humans. African stocks have also been damaged by their
activities and it is not unusual for poor African fishermen to be ruined
because of dumping of catches on local markets at prices with which they
find it impossible to compete. British and Irish fishermen are aware of
these problems and require support, but their own attitudes to
overfishing should also be examined. High-minded statements by the
Spaniards, appeals to international law or even the despatch of a
gunboat (and all of it supported by the EU) is the lowest form of
hypocrisy. So, incidentally, is the attempt by anti-Europeans to attack
the EU by invoking the utterly bogus spirit of plucky little Canada.
What must be appreciated, and quickly, is that fish stocks are a global
asset and an impending global disaster. As a vital source of nutrition
we should be preserving this resource rather than squandering it, and
one way of doing this is to recognise the global nature of the problem
and to stop approaching it on a regional and highly partisan basis.
Fisheries ministers from the main fishing nations have a responsibility,
not just to their own countries but to the world population of the
future, to deal with this issue in a sane and sensible manner. They meet
next week in Rome and there is no better time to start.

Istanbul, Tuesday,
TWO people were reported killed and one person injured in Istanbul's
troubled Gazi district today when a car exploded after being hit by
petrol bombs.
Turkish state television said the explosion occurred in Fatih street
in the run-down Gazi district, scene of two days of riots in which at
least 15 people have been killed.
Earlier, riot police in the capital Ankara used batons, water cannon,
and dogs to break up a rally by crowds angry over the killings in
earlier protests.
Armoured cars chased demonstrators down Ataturk Boulevard, sending
protesters fleeing down side streets.
Today's violence in the capital followed two days of riots in Istanbul
where members of the minority Alawite Muslim community live.
Riots erupted on Sunday night after gunmen attacked Alawite
coffeehouses, killing one person. The gunmen also killed the driver of a
taxi they seized for the raid.
The Ankara rally was called to protest against the killings as well as
the death and destruction that followed.
Clashes broke out in the capital when police stopped protesters from
marching on Parliament and demonstrators armed with sticks and stones
tried to storm a police barricade.
Officials said 17 policemen and 13 protesters were injured, and 20
people were arrested.
In Istanbul today hundreds of paramilitary gendarmes stood guard in
the battered Alawites' district.
Protesters said at least 10 people were killed yesterday and 200
wounded after police opened fire on the thousands of people who marched
through the main streets.
The Alawites, who oppose a rise in Muslim fundamentalism, complain of
discrimination by Turkey's majority Sunni Muslim population.--Reuter.

EVERYTHING seems to be going Glynwed's way at present with exports
booming, sales to the automotive sector and the better-off consumer
rising sharply and strong demand from new industries such as cable TV.
These combined to result in pre-tax profits rising last year by 47.5%
to #67.1m and allowed the engineering group to raise the dividend total
for the first time for five years with a 5.2% increase to 12.25p.
Over the years, the stock of the Birmingham-based firm has been a
disappointing investment with average earnings per share since 1985 of
17.8p compared with the 21.3p for 1994, representing negligible growth
in real terms. That does reflect the poor performance for several years
of the UK economy. While chairman Gareth Davies was cheerfully looking
to good continuing results in the domestic market for the next year or
two and better overseas profitability, Glynwed will have to struggle
hard over the next two years to achieve the earnings seen in 1989 at the
peak of the last boom at 28.8p.
This does sound a little sour particularly for a company which is so
efficient that it can make decent money out of exporting cast iron
products to Hong Kong and Singapore.
Consumer products benefited from an upsurge in demand for the Aga
Rayburn range of stoves. About 31 Aga shops are trading in county towns.
New efforts are being put into new gas cookers and fires as well as
stainless steel sinks which are sold in high volume to Germany. The
foundry business is being helped by cable TV -- Glynwed supplies street
covers to underground cable installations. Meanwhile, anything connected
with the motor sector at present seems to be buoyant.
Glynwed's exposure to new housing is fairly limited in comparison with
the repair and maintenance side. Metal products and services were helped
by the acquisition of RTZ Metal Stockholders, by productivity gains, and
a good European performance -- altogether direct exports accounted for
#250m of the #1025m group turnover, up 6.1%.
The dull spot continues to be the loss-making tubes business although
IMI seems to be doing quite well there.
Mr Davies is relinquishing his executive role in favour of Bruce Ralph
and so will have more time to concentrate on acquisitions. There,
Glynwed has the sensible policy of concentrating on being market leader
and so it is most unlikely to make any major diversification.
Profits this year should rise to about #78m which indicates the shares
at 293p are trading at just inder 12 times likely earnings. The yield is
5.2% -- an ideal stock for those not that ambitious.

BY maintaining sanctions against Iraq, the UN continues to reflect its
impotence to influence Saddam Hussein's Government in Baghdad. The first
conclusion to be drawn from this situation is that the force of economic
sanctions is far weaker than imagined by most who counselled their use
to save Kuwait without resort to military force. It would have been
better had they been proved right, but little leverage from popular
suffering is capable of being exerted on such a regime. A more developed
or liberal society would have responded differently, but that is beside
the point. Iraq is a military dictatorship of a particularly nasty kind.
Of course its interest would be better served were sanctions to be
abandoned, hence Tariq Azziz's visit to the Vatican on the eve of the UN
debate (Mr Azziz is a Christian). There is enough sanctions-busting
going on to ensure that the suffering which indubitably exists is not
shared by the country's political and military elites. There seems
little chance that popular discontent might provoke an uprising which
would unseat Saddam (which is what the coalition allies may have hoped
for when they stopped Desert Storm well short of Baghdad three years
ago). Even an internal military coup, which is theoretically more
likely, looks like a daunting prospect given the predictable ferocity of
the response were it to fail.
In that situation is there really much point in maintaining sanctions?
As was obvious last week, the Gulf Arab states have changed their own
tune and would like to see them lifted. To the extent that they weaken
Iraq without removing Saddam they may merely be playing into the hands
of the Iranians who have been making moves to consolidate their grip on
the Straits of Hormuz. The Iranian decision to establish new missile
systems (of Russian as well as Chinese origin) on both sides of the main
deep water channel at Hormuz has alarmed the oil exporting states whose
tankers must pass a potential gauntlet. The Iranians have built a
powerful position in the (disputed) islands in the waterway. The Gulf
states are simply frightened and want to end their enmity with Iraq in
self-protection against future Iranian ambitions, even though their real
protection comes from the United States which has, so far, disregarded
the new missile deployments.
The case against maintaining sanctions does not depend on the views of
Iraq's neighbours, however. It is more important to remember that the
victims are the mass of ordinary Iraqis who have little means of
influencing their own Government. In some areas -- those involving any
Iraqi nuclear capacity -- the UN got its way, eventually, by being
heavy-handed. And, when Saddam was unwise enough to sabre-rattle last
year, the quick military response and threat was enough to halt him in
his tracks. Unfortunately, sanctions are not that kind of weapon. Of
course, if sanctions are ended Saddam will claim a victory, a thought
which must be galling to decent people everywhere, but which is nothing
new from such a cynical man.

JOHN BIRT, the director-general of the BBC, has become celebrated as
an ''ism''. To the chattering classes in the south Birtism has come to
represent a dry, absolute approach to journalism, explanatory rather
than confrontational.
The chat is that under Birtism some of the BBC's brightest spirits and
most capable journalists are beginning to feel the chill wind of
conformity, the pressure to be dull, safe, and uncontroversial.
However, the concerns of the south pale into insignificance compared
with the crisis in Scotland. The impact of Birtism in Scotland is much
more insidious. Rapidly it is coming to represent the unfriendly
absorption of public service broadcasting by a creed which is
threatening to undermine the credibility of BBC Scotland.
The broadcasting industry in Scotland is being de-skilled -- and all
in the pursuit of so-called ''efficiency''. This week we have reports,
as yet unconfirmed, that BBC Scotland has lost the inhouse tender for
outside broadcast.
Last week's confirmed story with the loss of 86 jobs is the latest
round of cutbacks inspired by Birtism in Scotland. The make-up and
scenic designs departments in Glasgow are to be axed, along with dozens
of technical craft jobs, including cameramen and audio engineers.
Why should we worry about all of this? Is this not an inevitable
result of the continuing labour-shedding which has been witnessed across
the media? In addition, the official line from the BBC is that these job
losses will ''release'' more money for programmes. I'll believe that
when I see it.
The corporation's argument for further cuts is a charade thanks to a
bizarre accounting-driven system known as ''Producer Choice''.
As I understand it ''Producer Choice'' is not dissimilar to the
internal accounting system now plaguing the railways. It means that BBC
departments have to be costed as if they were free-standing,
private-sector operators. Their tenders are compared strictly on a cost
basis with what BBC producers might notionally expect from the private
sector.
Since its introduction some three years ago the BBC resources division
in Scotland has failed to make any money. Losses approach #1m this year.
The removal of control of resources from Glasgow to London cannot have
helped, despite BBC Scotland's pleas at the time that all would be well.
''Producer Choice'' may work in London, where independent facilities
houses abound. London has a critical mass in terms of available
freelance and private-sector skills. Scotland has not and when
(inevitably) BBC Scotland's own staff cannot live with the accountants'
standards of ''true cost'', more and more jobs will be lost and lost
forever.
Birtism in Scotland leads to the insanity of some studios and offices
lying empty because no-one dare use them for fear of being ''charged''
the full commercial rate.
Like many smart ideas ''Producer Choice'' comes unstuck when it
confronts the real world where markets and information are not perfect.
It was not designed with the Scottish situation in mind and we should
not be surprised that a London solution imposed upon Scotland is
producing such damage. That damage is cumulative.
Consider this. If you were a skilled, experienced BBC cameraman, made
redundant by the workings of the ''internal market'', would you hang
about Glasgow
More likely you will up sticks and head for London where there is some
guarantee of work and worthwhile work at that. Scotland therefore loses
broadcasting talent and the next time a Scottish producer looks for
local skills he or she will end up casting further and further afield,
perhaps even to London.
The likely result of ''Producer Choice'' will be that BBC Scotland
becomes a skeletal organisation with just its news and current affairs
department surviving alongside a few senior producers in drama, comedy,
and so on who will commission work only if London commissions anything
from Scotland.
That is a grim scenario. There is no doubt that in journalistic terms
BBC Scotland leads the pack. Whatever criticisms I have had in the past
about some aspects of output the BBC specialist journalists on both TV
and radio are generally outstanding. Equally there is no reason why
bi-media shouldn't be a success in Scotland, cutting out duplication.
But the pressure is on. Scotland competes for resources as part of the
BBC's ''regional directorate'' based, inevitably, in London, despite its
name.
For all the public relations, I wonder when if ever again we shall see
a BBC Scotland drama series with all the daring and splendour of John
Byrne's Tutti Frutti or Your Cheating Heart, both made during the 1980s
before the grey Mr Birt ascended mysteriously to the top of the BBC
tree.
The Scottish public is being betrayed. With each new Producer Choice
negotiation, and each subsequent cutback, the BBC moves closer to
abandoning its public service role as it apes the private sector and
continues Birt's Thatcherite revolution long after Thatcherism itself
became a discredited creed.
The National Heritage Select Committee has already voiced concern
about the implications of Birtism for Scotland and the other so-called
''national regions''. The Broadcasting For Scotland campaign is
attracting support from across the industry and from just about every
public body. The Broadcasting Council for Scotland has condemned the
latest cuts, adding that the BBC in Scotland was moving perilously close
to failure in its statutory role as a broadcaster.
Perhaps the new Scottish Governor, Norman Drummond, and indeed the
Controller of BBC Scotland, should see this growing public concern not
as a threat but as an opportunity -- an opportunity to mobilise national
sentiment to demand that the BBC once again serves Scotland instead of
Scotland being shoehorned into Birtism.

TRIPLE bills, as Puccini discovered when he composed Trittico, are
prone to last all night. Recognising the possibility of this, the Opera
Department of the RSAMD tailored its French triptych entitled Love,
Death, and Marriage to last well under three hours. This meant losing
the denouement of Frank Martin's Le Vin Herbe -- only the opening
section called Le Philtre was performed -- but resulted in a potentially
better-balanced programme.
Whether Le Vin Herbe actually works as an opera is in any case a moot
point. Martin wrote it as a 90-minute madrigal for a dozen voices, and
last night's simple, static staging by Nigel Warrington, enacted on and
around a central tripod designed by Caroline Scott, added little to the
Franco-Swiss composer's beautiful, restrained concert version of the
story of Tristan and Isolde.
Milhaud's updating of the Orpheus legend in his Malheurs d'Orphee, on
the other hand, clearly required some sort of staging, and though
Warrington seemed at first to have mistaken it for a French farce, he
finally got closer in touch with this moving village Orpheus, without
quite striking the balance between simplicity and sophistication the
music demanded.
Pinning down Offenbach's Le Mariage aux Lanternes proved no easier.
Treating it as something verbally English but visually French did not
really work, even if the decision to perform it in English translation
was a relief. Like the other pieces, it sported some promising young
singers but proved neither genuinely funny enough nor charming enough to
convey Offenbach's intentions. Timothy Dean conducted. Three more
performances, tonight, Friday, and Saturday.

HELL on earth is the claustrophobic confines of the Bates family home;
daughter, Patricia -- capably played by Joanna Lennie -- has been
mentally crippled by a car accident, Mrs Bates prays for a miracle and
rails against being confined to the house, while Mr Bates can't sleep at
night but transfers all his personal anxiety into political rage, with
National Front sympathies.
Then a stranger, Martin, ingratiates himself into their home, claiming
to be a former boyfriend of Pattie. Dennis Potter's stage play frames a
disturbing set of relationships within a fractured social milieux and
unrivals the darkness at the heart of both, but its potential explosive
power is never ignited in this production by New Stage Theatre.
The staging is uninspired, with a few naturalistic props; the acting
is good but misdirected, with director Judi Stewart concentrating too
much on the humour of Potter's cryptic work. What should be black and
hinted at instead blazes away, and thus robs the production of a
necessary, underlying unease.
Derek C Munn is obviously an accomplished actor but playing Martin as
quite so ludicrously twee endowed his character with a transparency
which would have failed to fool anyone, even the harassed Bates. Jane
Dunbar excels as Mrs Bates, all goofy giggles and faltering smiles, and
Finlay McLean is suitably brittle as her husband but the interaction
between the three is never credible. The only moment of raw tension came
too late, with Lennie's dreadful scream at the cataclysmic climax which
turns what could have been a happy ending into an even darker tale.

Here I'm sitting, grinning wildly
At a show that has beguiled me
Absolutely from the start.
I'd be happy ever after
To join in its songs and laughter --
Who says critics have no heart . . . No brain . . . just noive?
FOR the moment, all the best yellow brick roads lead not to Emerald,
but to Edinburgh City where that wizz-of-a-wiz, Paul Iles, has brought
in a touring Oz full of affectionate regard for Dorothy and her fellow
adventurers. It's so easy to enter into the innocent, fantastical spirit
of Frank L Baum's story when the people on stage are playing it as
caringly as intelligently as if it was, say, Shakespeare's As You Like
It -- where folk don't even have to go over the rainbow, but only into a
nearby forest to find themselves!
By and large the images recreated on stage are reminiscent of the 1939
MGM film. Sets, costumes, bits of business -- there's plenty that will
strike all us Oz-fans as pleasingly familiar. At the same time, however,
there's a robust element of individuality in the performances. Rachel
Pittman isn't just a Judy look-alike, sound-alike. She has her own
up-and-at-'em energy, her own way of singing the well-known standards so
that we end up wishing on a star for Dorothy to see Kansas and Ms
Pittman to be seen by the right agents.
Diplomas, medals, and testimonials galore are the very least one can
award Peter Duncan's scarecrow, Arthur Bostrom's Tinman, and Brian
Blessed's dippy daffy Lion. Again it's the sincerity shining through the
performances that lends a very special magic to the whole affair. And
there is, too, a sense that those on stage are having fun themselves --
Hildegard Neil's glorious cackle as the Wicked Witch is crammed with a
glee that can't, surely, be purely affectation.
At the end there were whoops and hollers from an audience whose ages
ranged from tinies through to tottering oldies. Little wonder. We had
all been transported to a very special realm of make-believe, given
enough fun and action to send us out into the night thinking we had
stumbled across a pot of gold. Slip into those ruby slippers, click your
heels, and somehow indulge yourself with a trip to Oz-in-Edinburgh.

PHARMACEUTICAL group Medeva continues to grow strongly and sees
further progress in 1995.
Annual profits exceeded City estimates at #64.2m, an increase of 35%.
Sales rose by 20% to #240m boosted by strong US demand for
Methylphenidate, its anti-hyperactivity drug. There was also strong
growth in sales of its seasonally import influenza vaccine.
The company is benefiting from the restructuring of the pharmaceutical
industry which is enabling it to acquire products and businesses which
are non-core parts of larger groups.
Chief executive Bill Bogie said that the group would continue to
pursue its policy of acquisitions and alliances with major
pharmaceutical firms. The firm bought generic anaesthetic manufacturer
Inhalon Pharmaceuticals at the end of the year and also made an alliance
with SmithKline Beecham in vaccines.
City analysts expect Medeva to continue to produce above average
growth in earnings per share. There are long term hopes for the
development of its hepatitis B vaccine Hepagene which could transform
the group into a major player.
Last year, earnings per share advanced 24% to 14.6p and the dividend
per share was raised by 22% to 3.3p. Medeva shares jumped 15p to 196p.
Paul Krickler of Goldman Sachs believes the shares will continue to
outperform the market because they appear undervalued on a
price/earnings basis.

SETTLE back and enjoy this column. Look, I know you will. I'm not
being immodest. It's simply fate.
You see, before I wrote it I had a snooze and I dreamt I was in the
jungle and Tarzan, who looked like Liam Neeson in a loin cloth, was in
this frothing river fighting off this big crocodile -- an ugly, vicious
thing, I can tell you -- and so I stripped my kit off -- bizarrely I was
wearing a woollen two-piece despite the tropical heat, but, 'tsk, that's
dreams for you -- tore off my high heels and dived in to rescue him, and
I grabbed the croc's big jaw and punched it in the throat and it floated
away and Tarzan/Liam looked at me with such gratitude and . . . well, I
don't have to tell you about that bit. Suffice to say, I killed the croc
and as any Mystic Meg worth her crystal ball knows, that signifies that
I will be successful beyond my expectations. Thus, this column clearly
cannot fail.
Dreams are the playpark of the mind; our daily life might be limited
by lack of talent, beauty, or wings, but when Mr Sandman comes along our
potential is unleashed and we can stun Carnegie Hall, seduce Ralph
Fiennes, and soar above the Empire State Building in a flight of
unrivalled fantasy.
The dark side is that we can also be pursued by packs of fanged beasts
as we vainly try to run against G-Force gravity in dim, haunted streets,
or be stricken with fear as, mid-flight, we plummet, Icarus-like to the
ground.
Any wonder then, that while some might leave us with a wistful smile
on our face in the dawn, we should really be grateful that although pop
singer Gabrielle insisted ''Dreams Can Come True'', in fact they rarely
do. Well, not in literal terms, although psychologists have long
propounded that our dreams can reveal more about us than their actions
do, and Freud was particularly fascinated by dreams, finding sexual
repression simmering beneath many symbols.
Dreamtime, which can take up as much as two hours of an average eight
hours' sleep, can also be a fund of creativity. Salvador Dali got
inspiration for his surreal paintings by sleeping with his arm hanging
over the side of his bed, with a spoon tied to his finger, poised above
a metal dish. When he dozed off his arm would droop and the resultant
clatter of spoon against dish would waken him. He was trying to capture
what is now recognised as the hypnagogic state, the relaxed realm of
semi-consciousness between being awake and asleep which can stimulate
creative thought.
Most of us have experienced this; personally, I've often strained to
write an article, only to give up, go to bed, then mentally script the
whole thing in perfect prose before dropping off. Only to wake up as
befuddled as before.
A friend, Tomaso, an art director and musician, has the answer to
this; he now sleeps with a note pad at his bedside, ready to harness his
hypnagogic energy, and scribble down typographic plans or lyrics.
Dreams are fascinating and a whole new-age culture has grown up around
the interpreting of them, alongside serious academic sleep research.
Last weekend a British psychologist, Dr Keith Hearne, announced he is
about to market the Hearne Dream Machine.
The spook-sized computer does not, alas, induce tailor-made dreams but
instead helps the sleeper to trigger a state of ''lucid dreaming'',
which basically means maintaining a level of conscious control over the
subconscious.
Users of the prototype claim that they have utilised this to liberate
their artistry or to have mental conversations with deceased relatives
but most enjoy the opportunity to comprehend more fully the symbolism of
their dreams. But you don't need to fork out over #200 for the doc's
mail-order dream machine to disinter your nightly mind-ramblings.
A few pounds and the visit to any bookstore specialising in mystical
tomes enables you to set up your very own self-psychology class.
A whimsical purchase of Dreams, Hidden Meanings and Secrets published
by Tophi Books, has transformed me into The Herald's very own Gypsy Rose
Lee. This directory explains the significance of dream symbols, from an
abalone (foretells an unusual experience) to a zither (peace of mind and
a host of friends).
Some symbols are really self explanatory; dreaming of abandoning your
wife portends trouble of a serious nature (you bet, smirk the divorce
lawyers), going abroad means you will take a foreign trip soon, while
dreaming of falling means you should watch your step. Some, like
murdered crocodiles, are more bizarre. The man who broke the bank, Nick
Leeson, might find his nights are currently troubled by the dreadful
spectre of high-pitched abbots (make amends for your wrongs), but should
break into a sweat if he dreams of spices, as this means a trip to a Far
Eastern country is in the offing.
His bosses at Barings would sleep easier if they dreamt of Eskimos,
which means you can pay your debts, although they might toss and turn if
said Eskimos were dancing around a bright, white flame, signifying
creditors hounding you down.
Roseanna Cunningham, currently contesting Perth and Kinross for the
SNP, could doze happily if she dreamt of plum juice trickling down her
chin; despite the saucy imagery it means she would be appointed to a
position of great honour, while Bambi Blair must be desperate to sight
Father Time in his sleep as this means he would be chosen to carry
burdens of state and win honour and respect.
However, you'd probably need Dr Hearne's machine to enable you to
recall an abalone, which is a type of shell fish, or to spot a myrtle
tree (many lovers) in your dreams.
Medical men have slammed Hearne's invention, warning such
introspection could cause serious internal conflict. They've missed the
most glaring danger of such a device, that it will create a plague of
dream bores. There is surely nothing more grey hair inducingly tedious
than someone accounting their dream in agonising detail. Other people's
dreams are always dull as dish water. 'Cept mine of course.

THE strength of Labour's traditional vote in Glasgow is likely to be
tested as never before when candidates line up for the single-tier
council elections next month.
In recent years the biggest hurdle for Labour activists has been to
get selected as candidates, with the election in most cases being a
formality.
This time around the problem for many of the Labour candidates will be
in getting elected, after the bitterest and messiest selection process
in the history of the city party.
Legal challenges proliferated as nominees squabbled over the
eligibility of delegates to vote at selection meetings. The apparent
chaotic state of the Labour Party's national membership scheme has been
the source of much of the strife.
Not included in the list of candidates are two current Labour
councillors who feel they have been victims of the much-maligned
selection process.
Councillor Margaret Sinclair lost the Crookston nomination to regional
councillor William Timoney by a cut of cards. She was then granted a
re-run selection meeting by the Scottish Labour Party after she had
questioned the eligibility of two individuals to participate in the
meeting.
Then later she was told by Labour headquarters in London that the
re-run had been cancelled, because ''the rules are sufficiently
ambiguous to suggest that a case could be brought against the decision
to re-run the selection meeting''.
She submitted nomination papers in the hope that an eleventh-hour
decision might save her, but a reprieve was not forthcoming and she
withdrew in fear of disqualification from the party.
A second casualty was Councillor Hugh Macrae, who also lodged an
appeal regarding eligibility after losing the Greenfield nomination to a
fellow district councillor, Mr William Butler. He was also hopeful of a
last-gasp appeal being allowed and had been advised to submit nomination
papers, pending a letter from the Labour Party.
When his appeal didn't materialise yesterday he declined to lodge his
nomination papers. However, he intends to write to the party leader, Mr
Tony Blair, complaining bitterly about the way he has been treated.
The other major negative factor for Labour has been the long-running
factional war between supporters of the current Labour leader at the
City Chambers, Councillor Patrick Lally, and the woman he deposed as
leader, Councillor Jean McFadden.
According to informed sources, the ''clash of cultures'' between
academics and artisans has brought the party into disrepute, although it
is hoped that the influx of former regional council members, probably
led by current regional leader, Councillor Robert Gould, can break up
the conflict.
But the regional contingent will bring with them the legacy of the
controversial M77 motorway extension which is being turned into a major
election issue by Militant and a sprinkling of Green candidates.
Relishing Labour's discomfiture is the Scottish National Party, which
is contesting all 83 seats. Its leaders contend that the enthusiasm of
their activists will wreak havoc in certain heartland areas where Labour
branches can scarcely claim to exist.
Also hoping to capitalise on Labour inertia are the Militants, led by
super-activist Councillor Tommy Sheridan. They are targeting 19 seats in
the large council housing estates, particularly Drumchapel, Easterhouse
and Pollok.
While Labour councillors condemn Mr Sheridan and his cohorts as a
one-issue party, it is not unusual for Labour members to seek Militant
advice in fighting cases of constituents threatened with warrant sales
because of poll tax debt.
Labour, of course, can point to its record of regenerating the city.
Liberal Democrats may find themselves struggling to find a locus amid
the fire and fury of the wider contest, while hard-pressed Conservatives
can only hope to escape total annihilation.
Some, like the current group leader, Councillor William Aitken, and
his senior colleague, Bailie John Young, are quietly distancing
themselves from the fall-out generated by party policy at national level
and are vigorously pursuing local issues as the only way of achieving
even modest credibility with the electorate.
Two of the fiercest contests will be in Drumchapel, where almost
everyone under the sun seems to be gunning for Labour.
In the first Drumchapel ward, Drumry, Labour's housing convener,
Councillor Marjorie O'Neil, finds herself in a six-cornered fight with
Militant, Conservative, Independent, SNP and Liberal Democrat
candidates.
Her party colleague, Mr Martin Lee, faces a similar cluster of
opposition, minus an Independent, in neighbouring Summerhill.
Militant leader Tommy Sheridan faces a tough challenge at Pollok from
Mr Stuart Petrie, secretary of Pollok Constituency Labour Party.
Meanwhile his mother, Alice, is contesting Govan.

ANYONE inclined to believe the Diary makes things up can apologise
this minute. The following story is perfectly true, mostly.
Back at the turn of the year, you may recall, our esteemed critic Alan
Bold was contributing a series of articles to Weekender reassessing
great literary texts. Ulysses was there, and Lady Chatterley's Lover. To
wind up, Bold decided to write about Chips On My Shoulder, the
posthumous first and last novel by Sarah Munro (1960-94).
He was much impressed, arguing that the autobiographical tale of a
Glasgow chip shop owner's daughter and her descent into depression,
drugs, and prostitution, was ''bawdier than Boswell'', that its erotic
prose was ''astonishing'', and that, in general, it amounted to a
remarkable narrative. To prove the point he quoted at length from the
book in advance of its publication by the Black Dog Press.
Naturally enough, such an endorsement from a critic of Bold's calibre
attracted attention, yet the novel proved hard to find. One gentleman
even telephoned The Herald's Aberdeen office for assistance. Across
Scotland, meanwhile, expectations ran high.
Finally, we received a bemused call from Erskine Library. Chips On My
Shoulder sounded like their kind of book, but where might it be found?
The Black Dog Press had been no help at all. People were puzzled.
Not, however, half as puzzled as Mr Bold. For the fun of it -- and to
see who might catch on -- he had invented Sarah Munro and her novel. But
he had also, or so he thought, made up the Black Dog Press.
Thus, the invented story of an invented book from an invented
publisher had turned reality inside out. Spooky eh? All that remains to
be seen is whether the Black Dog Press, alive and well in Devon, is
ready to turn Alan's synopsis into a book and put the folk at Erskine
Library, and several others, out of their misery.
Minute detail
A PRESS release from the Home Office is an impressive document. Lovely
italic script, nice paper, royal crest, imposing address, and a plethora
of contact numbers. Naturally, in representing one of the great
departments of state, such a missive will be posted first class and the
taxpayer won't mind the expense a bit.
Thus it was that we were honoured to receive our very own
communication from Michael Howard's busy people. With trembling fingers
we tore open the envelope. What matter of national importance awaited;
what words of wisdom from HMG?
Just this: ''British Summer Time begins at 1am Greenwich mean Time on
Sunday 26 March, when clocks should be put forward . . .'' Makes you
proud, what?
Twice as good
THRILLED to bits by the thought that their president is being tipped
to replace Boutros Boutros-Ghali as secretary-general of the United
Nations, Dubliners, we hear, have taken to referring to a certain Mary
Mary Robinson.
Strictly speaking
THE recent tale of the rail worker sacked for drinking a pint of beer
only days before his retirement summed up the sweet, caring nature of
modern Britain, we thought. Bert Stapleton, after 44 years of service,
was on paid leave to attend a union negotiating meeting (discussing
staff cuts, amusingly) with Regional Railways South Wales &amp; West. He had
given up a day's leave to take part and was actually on his way home
when he was spotted with a colleague in a station buffet.
Bert's bosses claimed he and his mate were ''technically'' on duty and
thus felt free to deprive him, at a stroke, of a weekly pension of #45
and a lump sum of #18,000. If that seems harsh, though, consider what a
spokesman had to say: ''They were dismissed in line with our
disciplinary drugs and alcohol policy which states that working and
drinking are not allowed.''
We understand breathing is still allowed, but only in your own time.
Horns of dilemma
UP in Caithness, meanwhile, there is growing controversy over school
meals. Remembering culinary delights you could paste wallpaper with, we
can well understand.
In Caithness, though, it's the source of the grub rather than its
nature that's causing trouble. After years of buying meat fresh from
local butchers, Highland Contract Services, luncheon purveyors to the
region, are buying in frozen stocks from the south. Even the bread is
now supplied by a Sheffield-based firm.
Aside from wondering how this arrangement can possibly be cheaper,
some people are asking if the obvious is being missed. Let them eat
venison! As Thurso district councillor Falconer Waters has said: ''We
have a natural resource running gaily (sic) around the hillside and
no-one seems to have considered it.''
Why not? Shooting parties of spotty youths could be despatched up the
hills to learn self-sufficiency. Domestic science could encompass stag
skinning. It might be the only way. Highland Contract Services point
out, after all, that venison was tried a few years ago and found to be
too expensive.
It's no cheap, in other words, it's deer.
To the point
THERE are mornings when we think we know how it feels to be 120, but
only Jeanne Louise Calment, the Frenchwoman who passed that milestone
last month, can say for sure.
Naturally her birthday attracted the attention of the world's press,
who descended on Arles en masse and in style. Jeanne gave numerous
interviews, and managed to dispel the illusion that wits necessarily
depart with youth. Asked by one scribbler how she envisioned her future
she replied, simply, ''Short''.
Fly move
PETER Capaldi, that splendid actor, is fast carving out a career for
himself as a director. His 25-minute film, Franz Kafka's It's a
Wonderful Life, has picked up a Bafta, and is now a hot tip for a
well-deserved Oscar.
Frankie Kafka, you might remember, wrote about the bloke who woke up
one morning and found he had turned into a giant insect. Naturally
enough, therefore, Capaldi is being courted to direct the sequel to
Beetlejuice.
Clause for thought
THE Diary is a democratic socialist diary. It believes that through
the strength of common endeavour, by realising our true potential, and
in the spirit of solidarity, tolerance, and respect, the truth about
Labour's new Clause 4 can be revealed. Thus, for the first time, those
Aims and Values in full:
1. To be really nice to just about everyone.
2. To get elected.
3. Er, that's it.

WORK on 23 flats in Fraser Street, Aberdeen, has been started by
Barratt Construction. The #700,000 project is to be phased in over a
nine month period.
The development is directly opposite the award winning Hutcheon Street
development, also built by Barratt Construction.
''The flats are being built on the former carpet warehouse and dairy
site and will offer quality accommodation in the area,'' says Barratt

Washington, Tuesday,
PRESIDENT Clinton tonight moved to clamp down on business links with
Iran, which he accuses of ''unacceptable behaviour''.
He announced an executive order banning Americans from signing
contracts for developing oil in Iran.
The order most directly affects Conoco, which planned to develop huge
offshore oilfields with Iran.
The White House said Clinton would act ''shortly'' in response to
Iran's support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine the
Middle East peace process, and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.
''We have worked energetically to press the Government of Iran to
cease this unacceptable behaviour,'' a White House statement said.
''To allow US companies to finance or manage the development of Iran's
hydrocarbon resources would contribute to Iran's productive capacity and
its economic and financial strength. We think it is important to stop
American participation in these kinds of activities,'' it added.
The statement said Washington had worked closely with its allies to
prevent Iran from winning access to goods which would enhance its
military capabilities.
In Oman, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he did not think Iran
posed an increasing threat to the stability of the region, but its
policies were such that it was right for everyone to be
vigilant.--Reuter.

LIFE in the 1990s is getting tough for ageing roues like myself. The
world has become prudish, censorious, faddist. A child of the 1960s, I
wonder if all our work of liberation then has gone for nothing. The time
has come to consider seriously whether I should start smoking again in
defiance of the all-pervading sanctimony.
Among the old-fashioned pleasures to which I have continued to devote
myself are those of the table. This career started early. Soon after I
arrived at university, I got an invitation to an Oxfam lunch, at which
for an exorbitant price I was expected to consume bread and water, or
something, and donate the difference to the starving millions. I
immediately set up a rival organisation called Oxfat, where nothing less
sybaritic than oysters and asparagus was permitted.
Like the Rev Sydney Smith's, my idea of heaven is pate de foie gras to
the sound of trumpets. And when I say gras, I mean gras, with the
gorgeous yellow goose-fat congealed round the liver, as served in
France, and a bottle of Sauternes with it. Why not a succulent steak to
follow, again properly marbled with fat, in a nice creamy sauce? And
then, as we reach the end of our bottle of claret, the need for cheese
becomes imperative.
My favourite of all is Maroilles, which comes from a district on the
border of France and Belgium. It is a miracle how much pungency can be
squeezed into a small square of putrefying milk, about the size of a bar
of soap. The tiniest bite, and your whole mouth, nose, and throat are
filled with an overpowering odour of horse-dung. It is a bit too robust
for British palates, at any rate not easy to find here. But I have long
been happy to settle for Lanark Blue, a little creamier, a little
tangier. I hear that both Her Majesty the Queen and the Secretary of
State for Scotland, neither of whom I would rate in the same class of
gourmandise as myself, nevertheless share this taste. None of us, it
should be noted, is dead.
But according to the environmental health department of Clydesdale
district council, we have been endangering our lives. If they have their
way, we shall no longer be allowed to. On their evidence, a justice of
the peace has ruled that the entire existing stock of Lanark Blue
cheese, three tons of it worth #27,000 and the product of a whole year's
labour, was unfit for human consumption.
Last Tuesday, a lorry should have arrived in front of the factory at
Dunsyre belonging to Humphrey Errington, the dedicated maker of the
cheese. Under the direction of local officials, it would have taken his
stock away and buried it. That would have ruined him, and cost seven
other people their jobs in a rural area where they will not easily find
new ones.
Fortunately, the worst did not come to pass. An interim interdict was
secured against the council, and the case sent for judicial review in
the Court of Session, where it will be dealt with on March 22. Many of
Mr Errington's regular customers are clubbing together to help him meet
the inevitably high costs of the action.
The tale is not an unfamiliar one. As long as officialdom has existed,
it has run round trying to stop people doing what they want to do, and
relied for its censorious purposes on those with a penchant for petty,
narrow-minded excess of zeal. They no doubt now perform their duty with
all the more relish knowing that the spirit of the age is on their side.
Of course, we need to be protected from contaminated food likely to
make us ill. There is no proof, however, that Mr Errington's cheese has
made anyone ill. The evidence against him rests entirely on analysis
showing the presence of a certain kind of listeria bacterium in Lanark
Blue. That presence, it seems, creates a presumption of danger to the
public.
The trouble is that, if you analyse it, you will find bacteria in
whatever cheese you choose, except perhaps for that orange, rubbery
stuff that spuriously claims the name of Cheddar. Cheese is rotten. It
exists only because bacteria work on it. And bacteria are at work all
the time, all around us, on practically everything living and on
absolutely everything dead.
One investigation showed, for example, that 10% of sandwiches sold
over the counter were infected with listeria. This is actually quite
encouraging, since sandwiches are by definition full of dead matter. But
let me consider the risk posed to myself. Because I normally dine at
home or in a restaurant, I eat only about half-a-dozen such sandwiches a
year. I know some people eat them every day, so I have no way of telling
if my consumption is average.
On the heroic assumption that it is, then, say, 20 million sandwiches
are sold annually in Scotland. How many Scots die annually from
listeria? Four. There is thus a 0.00003% chance of my sandwiches killing
me. I think I shall carry on buying them when I have to, even from
ScotRail.
If all cheese contains bacteria, the logical consequence of the
regulations would be to ban it completely. This might tax the zeal of
the faddists, since many people like cheese and big companies make it;
Mr Errington's real sin is to be small enough for the zealots to bully.
Yet I would not be surprised if, before my arteries clog up, there is
some mass movement afoot, of screaming, scraggy feminists resident in
tree-houses, supported by horrid, radicalised schoolchildren, ranting in
unison that I may not eat cheese because it offends their moral
sensibilities and they know what is good for me. And the European
Commission will have supported them. It has started with meat. Can
cheese be far behind?

PALERMO: A father and son with links to organised crime were shot dead
outside the Sicilian capital Palermo last night, bringing to 11 the
number of people killed in a surge of Mafia bloodletting since February
25. Giuseppe Di Peri, 46, and his son Salvatore, 23, were killed in an
ambush in Villabate.
Meanwhile, suspected Mafia killer Antonio Fedele, 53, was arrested in
a suburb of Nice in the south of France. Last year he was convicted in
his absence of two killings and Italy had planned to seek his
extradition.

STREETS are frequently blessed with the most inappropiate names.
Terraces labelled above their station, or avenues named after some arid
corner of the globe.
Viewmount Drive in Maryhill, perfectly describes its situation. From
the windows of Kate Park's home at No.43 there is a panoramic view of
the city away to distant hills.
''At night the light looks beautiful,'' says Kate, ''especially from
the upstairs sitting room.''
The red sandstone end of terrace villa is built in an L-shape which
manages to make it delightfully unpredictable. Too spacious to be
described as quaint, the house refuses to be pigeon-holed.
Upstairs there's almost a cottage atmosphere with charming low windows
andd sloping ceilings. Downstairs, proportions are more formal, with
high ceilings and tall windows to the front.
''It's a sweet house,'' says Kate, ''full of nooks and crannies.''
Through the twin storm doors, the front door has an original etched
glass panel, while beyond it there is a square hall with room for a hall
table.
The large sitting room has four window panels, making it light and
very sunny. There is a gas fire as well as a central heating radiator.
Across the hall is a dining room which, as Kate points out, could
easily be made into a very large kitchen, using the downstairs bedroom
as a separate room for eating. It is large enough to serve as a cosy
family room and Kate's two dachsunds have a favourite place on the rug
in front of the fire.
The kitchen beyond has white units and a built-in cooker hob and
fridge. The window looks out over the garden.
The large adjoining porch with its glass sunroof makes an ideal place
to eat in the mornings. The guest bedroom on the ground floor would make
an ideal office, according to Kate, who is a business woman herself.
It has an unusual corner window as well as a large built-in cupboard
with louvred pine doors for storage.
The bathroom is next to it and been given a complete refurbishing.
There is pretty blue wallpaper and pale ivory tiles over the white bath
and matching suite, while the window has stylish white louvred shutters
instead of curtains. The bath shower has its own heating unit, though
there is a new central heating system and combi boiler for the rest of
the house.
The stairs at the other end of the main hall have their original
bannisters, and the rail has been stripped back to the natural wood.
''It took the painter about three days to do it, but the effort was
well worthwhile,'' says Kate.
The original master bedroom has been turned into a second sitting room
for Kate's cousin, who shares the house. It has a fine view from the bay
window.
The second bedroom is fitted with glass-fronted wardrobes on either
side of the bed, and there is plenty of space for a double bed and
Kate's bedroom suite. A door leads down to a large dressing room which
is currently used as a wonderfully accomodating store but it could
easily convert into an en suite bathroom.
Two more large bedrooms lead off the spacious upper hall, while above
there is a large floored loft.
Outside, the garden has a paved area to catch the sun, and lawns
hidden behind a well established hedge. Kate says she likes gardening
but just doesn't have time, which is why she is off to sample life in a
flat for a change. But not without regrets at leaving her house with a
view.

ST Patrick's Day is a particularly American celebration, marked more
exuberantly than any other secular event except the fourth of July
itself. In New York, they paint a green stripe down Fifth Avenue and
march along it. In Chicago, they pour green gunk into the river and, in
every city with a large Irish contingent, they march.
It's not like Ireland, of course. Many recent immigrants are mortified
at the green-for-a-day politicians, the leprechauns, the green beer, the
general falsity of it all. In Ireland, it's a saint's day, and that's
about it.
Many of them object, also, to the fringe Irish who put on black masks
and wave banners praising the IRA. They feel about Sinn Fein and its
apologists the way most Muslims feel about the fundamentalists who
hijack aeroplanes and murder foreigners in Algeria.
The whole thing started more than 200 years ago, in New York. The St
Pat's Day Parade thus has a respectable history, however many yobs from
the burbs come into town on the 17th to get drunk. The police now stand
around the subway stops along the parade route and send them back where
they came from.
Things are quieter in Washington, and indeed in most towns that hold
parades. For one thing, they have it on the Sunday nearest the 17th,
which is more convenient though less authentic.
It allows every local school to send its marching band down the main
street -- and that's the chief purpose of American parades.
It's all most decorous.
There is an oft-quoted statistic that there are 40 million people of
Irish descent in the United States. Yes -- but most of them are
Protestant. In a previous life, when I was writing leaders for The
Herald, I was once sternly taken to task for referring to John F Kennedy
as the first Irish-American President.
What about Madison, Monroe, Jackson, and a slew of others, I was
instructed, descendants of Protestants from Ireland who had settled in
the 13 Colonies and made a point of leading or joining the Revolution
against the British well before Wolfe Tone took up the sword? They are
known here as the Scotch-Irish, just to confuse matters, and are heavily
concentrated in the Appalachians and the South. Bill Clinton is one of
them (and his mother was Miss Cassidy). So was Richard Nixon (Ronald
Reagan is from a Catholic family that converted).
If most Irish-Americans take their greenery lightly, and deplore
terrorism, it was not always so. There has been a long tradition of
American-Irish involvement in the struggle against the British. After
the mid-nineteenth-century rebellions were crushed, the secret societies
were revived here. The IRB (the Irish Republican Brotherhood that
started the Easter Rising and founded the original IRA) was not only
founded, but derived much of its strength from the violently
anti-British Irish immigrants and their descendants in Chicago, New
York, Boston, and Philadelphia.
So Gerry Adams fits right in. He has two things going for him here.
The first is that there are no votes to be won by Bill Clinton or anyone
else by backing the British over Northern Ireland -- while there are
certainly votes to be lost. The second is that the Americans have noted
the way the tide is going, and want to end up on the dry side.
This means joining the Anglo-Irish effort to nail down Sinn Fein, and
the IRA itself, to pursuing their political objectives by peaceful
means. The trick is to persuade them that they have won, when in fact
they have lost. The armed struggle has achieved nothing save to put off
unification for another generation, at least.
It would be a nice gesture for them to hand over their Semtex, but no
more than that. They can always get a new supply, and it needs very few
gunmen to start the whole thing up again.
It is a nicer gesture to have them engaged in general political
discussions, whose purpose is to mitigate the alienation of the
Catholics and the fears of the Protestants. Mitigate, not eliminate.
That will take years.
Nicest of all is for Gerry Adams to stick to politics, and give up
permanently the Armalite-in-one-hand business. The Americans calculate
that by inviting him to the St Pat's Day festivities they will push him
further down that road.
So far, it's worked. Letting him in a year ago, for the first time,
helped push him, and Sinn Fein, towards the cease-fire and letting him
strut his stuff at the White House this year seems to have pushed things
a bit forward, perhaps even a lot forward. That remains to be seen, but
the Americans think it's worth a try.
At any event, if it does work, then the parades, the green beer, the
made-in-Hong Kong plastic shamrock, and all the noise and nonsense will
at last have justified itself.

Evelyn Dymock is a 45-year-old mother of two, from Glasgow, and a care
worker for people with senile dementia. Five years ago, while having a
bath, she found a small lump in one of her breasts. This is her record
of the fear, frustration, and heartbreak as she battled three times to
triumph over cancer
A LUMP in my breast. It can't be. It is a lump. It's probably nothing.
I think I will phone to arrange an appointment with my doctor as soon as
possible, because you read about lumps every day in the papers. Doctors
telling women to go straight to their GP. I will leave work early
tomorrow.
What if I have cancer? I'm thinking about that because my mum and dad
both died from it. Mum was 50. Dad was 54. I am very healthy. I could
never have it. I am too fit. I am aged 40. My life should begin then. I
think I should go to bed early and get a good sleep. I wish it was
tomorrow already -- no, I don't really.
Hello doctor. I'm fine, except for a small lump on my breast . . . The
doctor wants me to go to the Royal Infirmary to see a specialist. I must
go as soon as possible. I am beginning to shake now -- I cannot stop.
The last time I was in hospital was when I had my kids and that was
about 17 years ago.
Hello doctor, I have a small lump. My GP says you should look at it .
. . A needle biopsy, you say, just to take a fluid sample from the lump.
I hope it's not sore. Is that it? Good, it wasn't so bad. You want me to
go for a coffee and come back in 40 minutes. No problem.
It's time now to go in. Here goes. Hello doctor. Have you got the
results? You have? Good . . . The doctor wants me to sit down. He is
asking me if I came alone. The nurse is sitting very near to me.
Something is wrong. I have cancer.
You don't have to say it, doctor, but are you sure? Maybe it's a
mistake. I am going to America, doctor, on Saturday with my son. You
want to put me in hospital on Thursday? Can I go to America first? It
could be my last holiday. If I have my lump removed I might have a lot
of other holidays. I think I get the message, doctor. It's not fair --
why me? I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
I am walking out of the hospital, but I don't feel my feet on the
ground. I feel in a trance -- I am numb. I don't want to go home. I will
go into town. My God, I have just been told I have cancer and I am in
town, window shopping. All I want is to get a wee house for myself and
my kids. Maybe I won't get the chance now -- maybe I am having a
nightmare and will wake up soon.
November 10 is my operation day, mum's birthday -- maybe it's a lucky
omen. I should be putting my clothes in a case for the holidays --
instead I am getting clothes ready for the hospital; I just don't
believe this.
The doctor says he will explain what's to happen tomorrow. They will
remove the tumour and some of the lymph nodes under my arm. I feel sick
again . . . Why me?
I think I will sleep until visiting time and think of nice times -- my
childhood in Kilsyth. I went to Kilsyth Academy. I had these terrible
pigtails. I was small like my dad -- I'm still small, 4ft 11[1/2]in. I
wish you could turn the clock back . . .
Oh my God, here they come with their wee, green hats. Hi there, are
you going to put me to sleep now? You want me to count to ten. One, two,
three . . . Where am I, nurse? Yes, I am back in the ward. Have I still
got my breast? I'm scared to look, it's sore. Nurse, I think I need a
painkiller -- and a sick bowl. No, nurse, I could not eat tea and toast
just now.
Hello, doctor, you think you have got all the cancer -- thank you. I
will need to take a tablet called Tamoxifen every day. I can go home
today. Clinic next Wednesday. I don't know what to say. I have a big box
of chocolates for the nurses. They are angels, every one of them.
IN the following months, Evelyn and her husband separated, she moved
into a new temporary flat, restarted her job and attended a follow-up
clinic. She also met a new friend, Wullie.
Clinic day today -- I am nervous -- but it's just natural. My turn at
last. Hello, doctor. I feel tired but other than that I feel fine. You
feel another lump under my arm? No, doctor, it's got to be stress or
something. Doctor, I am starting to get my life together -- my daughter
is home now. Please doctor. I am back at work. It's got to be removed.
You said I was in the clear. I'm sorry, it's just not fair.
I can't sleep tonight. My mind is in a turmoil. Why does it have to
happen again?
Hi doctor, did you get the bad guys? Not exactly? What does that mean?
I need radium treatment just as a back-up. So you are not giving me the
all clear this time. It was a cancerous tumour. I knew it. I will be
going for three or four weeks' treatment. Thanks, doctor.
One week into treatment and I feel very sick. I spend more time in the
bathroom sitting on the floor. Last night, Wullie made me a meal -- 10
minutes later I was sitting on his bathroom floor really sick. The poor
man thought it was his cooking. I told him he would get used to me being
sick.
I wish I could have a bath, but they say I mustn't get water on my
skin. Wullie has an idea. Put clingfilm round my breast and under my
arm. Lie back in the bath and the water will run off. I feel like a
sandwich but it's heaven to soak in the bath. I will take the clingfilm
off now. My God, it won't come off. My skin is nearly off. I will have
to call out the doctor and tell him I have shrink-wrapped my breast. I
will look back and laugh at this but I am not laughing just now.
AFTER radium treatment, Evelyn was given the go-ahead to return to
work. She took a course on treating dementia and moved into a new house.
I'm scared to be too happy or something might happen. My family is
with me now, my house is nice and I have the chance of a new job. I
think I am on top of the cancer. I am a lucky woman. I think I'm going
to have a happy Christmas -- it's 10 weeks until Christmas.
I am feeling very tired and a wee bit sore under my arm. Maybe I have
been doing too much. I will go for my check-up soon anyway.
Hi, doctor. I am fine but I feel something wrong under my arm. It's
sore. A lump! Not again, maybe it's nothing. You feel it may lead to
surgery again? My God, I have my life sorted out now. It's not fair,
it's not bloody fair. I don't deserve this. You may as well write me off
now. I'm sorry, forgive me. You are doing your best. It is just my luck.
They say there is always light at the end of the tunnel -- when will I
see it?
Hi, doctor. What did you see when you opened me up? Bad cells. So the
lump is away? Still some bad cells. I must have chemotherapy? No way.
Not that. Chemo. My hair will fall out. My hair might not fall out. You
are going to put a tube in my groin and feed the chemo right up to my
breast and under my arm. It will be a massive dose, direct to the bad
bits. I am listening to you, but not really taking it in. It will take a
few months of treatment. Okay, doctor, I am in your hands.
EVELYN had several sessions of chemotherapy. During the treatment she
found two lumps, one in her breast and another under her arm. She
underwent surgery to have them removed in the summer of 1994.
Hi, doctor, how did it go? The lumps were non-malignant. Thank God!
You think you have done the right thing by taking them away as soon as
possible. It was probably the massive chemo that made the lumps come.
Today is my birthday, August 17. Thanks for the best present ever.
It's great to be home. I cannot sleep now. It's strange I am getting
better every day, yet I don't know how to relax or sleep. Maybe it's the
aftermath of everything that's happened to me in the last five years --
a divorce, cancer. It's just caught up with me now. I cry for nothing. I
am going to see the breast sister about a new bit for my breast as I
lost quite a lot with all the surgery. Just a few wee hiccups. Nothing I
cannot overcome. I hope I feel well on Saturday so I can go out. I will
have a drink of wine with my friends even if I suffer the next day. But,
what the hell! I think I deserve it. Don't you?

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday said they would spend at
least #250m improving the country's education system.
The party's education policies for the new single-tier local
authorities were unveiled at a Glasgow press conference by Mrs Ray
Michie, the MP for Argyll and Bute, and Councillor Christopher Mason,
the Strathclyde party leader.
Mr Mason claimed the education system was among the worst in Europe
and he warned it would deteriorate further, if policies were not
altered.
The party is committed to repairing the country's crumbling schools --
at an estimated cost of #450m over more than 10 years -- improving
training and pay for teachers and offering nursery education to every
three and four-year-old child.
It has also promised to stop ''political interference'' in the running
of schools, colleges, and universities and decentralise power from the
Government and local education authorities.
The Liberal Democrats have also backed wider educational
opportunities, such as improvements in adult education, after-school
care, and special needs teaching.
Mrs Michie said: ''Education is at the centre of the Liberal Democrat
campaign for these new local authorities. We believe that education is
an essential investment, vital to the future of our society.''

Strasbourg,
THE European Union was on the brink of division with Britain last
night as the halibut war in the North Atlantic left Spain facing
''devastating'' evidence of illegal fishing.
The issue appeared likely to embarrass the Government as Tory
Euro-sceptics gained support from opposition MPs, including the SNP, in
criticising British expressions of EU solidarity with the Spanish.
Last night, eight Tory Euro rebels sent a letter to the Canadian High
Commissioner in London, attacking EU fishing practices and extending
their sympathies to Canadian fishermen.
As the arguments moved from legal to environmental issues, Britain's
Labour MEPs, who had previously supported the tough stand of the
European Parliament socialist group on behalf of Spain, were last night
showing signs of backing down. ''It seems we might have miscalculated,''
one said.
Political arguments raged across the Atlantic as the Canadian
authorities searched the seabed off Newfoundland for the nets of the
seized Spanish freezer ship, Estai. They want to examine the size of the
mesh on the nets used to haul in the Estai's catch of Greenland halibut
or turbot. The nets were cut as the ship was arrested.
According to Canada, up to 80% of the catch was undersized. Canadian
Government figures also claimed investigators had found sheeting on
board which could have been used for lining nets and that the log book
showed the skipper had lied about his catch.
Examination of the Estai's haul showed more than 80% was halibut but
the entry showed just over 40%.
The SNP, tough critics of Spanish fishing practices over the years,
denounced Spain's dispatch of a gunboat to protect its fleet. ''The days
of gunboat diplomacy are long gone,'' said Dr Allan Macartney (North
East Scotland).
Lord Plumb, leader of the British Tories, noticeably failed to back
the EU's tough line against Canada. Although he condemned the use of
firepower against an unarmed EU fishing boat, he added: ''There is doubt
surrounding much of this matter. We need to get at more facts.''
Labour's Hugh McMahon, whose Strathclyde West constituency includes
several Clyde fishing ports and who sits on the European Parliament's
fisheries committee, said: ''I can understand the Canadians' extreme
frustration. This matter should be settled by negotiation.''
He supported cross-party calls for a cooling-off period and a
temporary withdrawal of Spain from the Grand Banks, once one of the
world's richest fishing grounds, beyond the Canadian 200-mile limit.
Spain yesterday threatened to send more gunboats as the dispute
escalated. Madrid authorities also pledged to introduce trade sanctions
and hinted at a complete break in diplomatic relations with Canada.
The Spanish Foreign Minister made a gaffe at the European Parliament
in Strasbourg. Mr Javier Solana at first dismissed reports of the Estai
catching undersized fish as ''wrong''.
When asked how he knew they were wrong, he said: ''I did not say they
were wrong. I said they were irrelevant.''
International lawyers will be needed to settle the issue if diplomacy
fails. The Canadians last night insisted the law was on their side
because the Estai's catch -- now impounded at St John's, Newfoundland --
could not have been hauled in by legally-sized nets.
Mr Jacques Roy, Canadian ambassador to the EU, said the catch found in
the Estai had come as a ''shock to the conservation conscience of the
world''.
However the EU continued to insist that the Canadians had acted
illegally by firing over the bows of the Estai and forcing it to dock in
St John's where the skipper now faces charges. Mrs Bonino said there was
no question of the EU entering into diplomatic negotiations until the
ship was released.
A defiant Mr Solana said the Canadians should release the Estai now,
allow it to resume fishing, and ''restore legality''. Mr Manuel Medina,
a leading Spanish socialist MEP, condemned the use of Canadian
firepower, saying: ''We cannot negotiate under the gun.''
Mrs Pauline Green, British leader of the big parliamentary socialist
group, said the Canadian action was ''totally unacceptable''.
However the Canadians, buoyed by their ''devastating'' evidence of the
Estai's undersized haul, continued to call the EU's bluff.
Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin underlined Ottawa's concern
that stocks in the North Atlantic were being killed off.
''Many of the fish that were caught were smaller than the palm of my
hand,'' he said, and told the Canadian Parliament: ''This must stop.''
Mrs Bonino countered by saying the Canadians had exaimned the nets of
the Estai twice in December and ''everything was in order''.

A PLAN published yesterday emphasised that all of the 308,000 staff of
Scotland's present 62 regional and district local authorities should be
transferred to the 29 new unitary councils to be set up under
re-organisation.
Produced by the joint forum of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities and trade unions after a meeting in Edinburgh, it said that
a 100% transfer of employees was essential to maintain public services.
Councillor Pat Watters, convener of Cosla's personnel committee, and
Mr Mark Irvine, of the local government union Unison, said the plan was
vital in maintaining staff morale and allowing services to be
transferred seamlessly.
The Forum recommended that both existing and incoming councils should
adopt the plan, although it recognised that matching employees to posts
could begin only when the new councils had determined their structures.
The plan said that all employees would transfer to a new authority or
organisation with the exception of three groups: people who were
appointed to a new position before the change-over; employees whose
contracts of employment ended; and employees who took early retirement
or voluntary redundancy.
Transfer schemes should be on a basis of fairness and there should be
an appropriate appeals mechanism.
Asked about the possibility of job losses, Councillor Watters said:
''The new councils have to deliver the services. We don't see a problem
with a 100% changeover.''
A spokeswoman said Cosla's view was that 10% of employees would be
affected by re-organisation. ''Affected'' meant they could find
themselves working in a different department in a new council.
A Scottish Office spokesman said later it was estimated the total of
council employees could be reduced by between 200 and 1800.
He said: ''If new authorities wish to accept the transfer of all
employees, it is entirely up to them, but the Secretary of State would
not impose such a transfer.''

THE Scottish National Party last night claimed ''a historic
achievement'' in fielding around 990 candidates for the elections to the
29 new single-tier councils on April 6.
A spokesman at party headquarters in Edinburgh said the huge total of
candidates showed that the SNP was the national party for Scotland.
He said the total reflected the determination of the SNP to use the
elections to bring about a fresh start for local government in Scotland.
It also showed the depth of commitment of activists at the grass roots
as the SNP was a decentralised party.
Its new record total compared to the 850 it fielded at the last
district elections.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats also confirmed they were putting
up a record number of candidates for the April 6 elections.
The Labour Party said it planned to field a record number of at least
941 candidates.
For example, it would be challenging the SNP head-on in the new Angus
council, where the party has a candidate in each of the 26 wards on the
new single-tier authority, and it would have 10 candidates in the
Borders where it had none previously.
There will also be 19 Labour candidates in the 72-seat new Highland
authority.
In the four city authorities, Labour will contest every seat and will
do the same in many other central belt areas.
At Liberal Democrat headquarters in Edinburgh, chief executive Andy
Myles said the party's latest total was 520 candidates, a 25% increase
on its previous record of 415 in the 1984 district elections when it was
still in alliance with the SDP.
The party would have a higher number of target seats than ever before.
It had moved into third place in Scottish local government at last
year's regional elections after Labour and the SNP and its aim was to
confirm that position on April 6.
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservative Party said it was pleased
that with a field of about 590 it looked as if it had almost matched its
total number of candidates for the last district elections in 1992.
He insisted the Tories were not downhearted about their showing in the
Scottish opinion polls and were raring to go in the elections.
Meanwhile, SNP leaders yesterday said they were determined to remove
the dead wood from among Labour councillors in Scotland at the local
polls.
''Not only the dead wood,'' promised leader Alex Salmond, ''but also
the dead hand of Labour control from many of Scotland's local
authorities.''
Speaking at a press conference in Edinburgh to launch the SNP's
campaign, he said the party was ''extremely well placed to deliver an
exceptionally strong performance throughout Scotland in these
elections''.
Mr Salmond said he expected the party to gain ground across Scotland.
He believed there would be SNP representatives in every council and more
authorities would move into SNP control.
Party leaders also forecast the SNP would consolidate its position in
West Lothian where it is in control of the present district council by a
whisker and named areas like Falkirk, Clackmannan, and Kilmarnock where
it could make advances.
It also hopes to retain control in the new Angus council and wants a
strong showing in Perth and Kinross where the parliamentary by-election
is pending.
Mr Salmond said that in the aftermath of the ''Great Debate'' with
Labour and in anticipation of the Perth and Kinross by-election contest
with the Tories, morale and motivation within the party was extremely
high.
''SNP support has been rising steadily since the turn of the year and
we are confident of translating this support into seats won on April
6.''
At last year's regional elections the SNP won 26.7% of the vote and
secured a total of 73 councillors. They also have 150 district
councillors.
In the present two-tier structure it currently controls Angus district
and West Lothian which will become single-tier councils. It also leads
the adminstration in Lochaber which will become part of the new Highland
authority.
The party controls Tayside region, is the joint administration in
Grampian region, and is part of the administation in Dumfries and
Galloway region.
David Ross, Highland Correspondent writes: The SNP launched a serious
bid to become the single biggest party on the new Highland council but
with 35 candidates standing for 72 seats outright control reamins an
impossibility.
The Labour Party fields 18 candidates; the Liberal Democrats 14;
Conservatives three; the Highland Green Party two; and one Scottish
Christian Democrat. The remaining 110 candidates are standing as
Independents.
The position has been slighly complicated by one Independent putting
his name forward in three wards; another in two; and one of the Tory
candidates also appearing in two wards. They have till 4pm tomorrow to
make up their minds.
More than half of the SNP candidates will be in and around Inverness
where the party will fight 18 of the 19 seats.
The party's Highland campaign organiser, Mr Norman Will, said
yesterday he was happy that the tradition of independent local
government in the Highlands was now being challenged.

Valenciennes, Tuesday
MAVERICK French football boss and politician Bernard Tapie claimed
today to be the victim, not the instigator, of a match-rigging scandal
in which he faces up to three years in jail.
The former Marseille chairman took the stand to give his account of
the alleged bribery of Valenciennes players to throw a key 1993 league
game, six days before Marseille won the European Cup.
Tapie dismissed yesterday's damaging testimony by his former
right-hand man, Jean-Pierre Bernes, that it was he who initiated
payments to three Valenciennes players, saying that no other witness had
named him as responsible.
''Everyone was blaming him (Bernes), so now he is saying it was me,''
the French and European MP told the court.
''I do not believe that Marseille players or officials tried to bribe
the Valenciennes team,'' Tapie added.
''On the contrary, I believe the conditions were created to make it
possible to challenge the outcome of the match if it was lost.''
Marseille were stripped of their French and European titles and
demoted to the second division over the scandal. Tapie was banned from
running the club.
Bernes has said that the whole Marseille team knew about the
match-rigging, which had been decided aboard Tapie's yacht the previous
weekend.--Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday,
A SPECIAL prosecutor is to be appointed to examine allegations that
Henry Cisneros, the secretary of housing, lied to the FBI over pay-offs
he made to his mistress.
There are already two special prosecutors at work, one looking into
all the Whitewater affair, the other examining alleged misuse of
government funds by agriculture secretary Mike Espy.
Mr Espy resigned when the attorney general, Janet Reno, decided a
special prosecutor was needed. Now we are waiting to see whether she
nominates two more, to look into the secretary of commerce, Ron Brown,
and the secretary of transportation, Federico Pena.
It is all horribly embarrassing for the president.
When Mr Cisneros was nominated in 1993, he told the White House and
the FBI that he had been paying a pension to a former mistress, Linda
Medlar. He was then mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and when he decided to
dump her and stay with his wife, he agreed to make payments to her.
The affair became public a year ago, when he stopped the payments. Ms
Medlar then told the FBI that in fact Mr Cisneros had paid her a great
deal more than he had admitted.
Things do not look good for Mr Cisneros. Despite his decision to stay
on, he loses most of his effectiveness: the Republicans already promise
public hearings. But that is small beer compared to the affairs of Ron
Brown, a former chairman of the Democratic Party who managed the
president's election campaign in 1992 and proposed to do so again in
1996.
He is under investigation for various business dealings and possible
tax evasion. It would be a huge blow to the Democrats if he is pulled
down.

NURSES took to the streets of Edinburgh yesterday to enlist public
support for their 3% pay claim.
Staff nurse Michele Rumsey, campaign organiser for the Royal College
of Nursing in Scotland, said: ''Our mood is pure frustration and anger
at the 1% the Government has offered. Nurses are demoralised, and feel
so undervalued that they are totally exhausted.
''We have just got to make the public aware of what is happening.''
Ms Rumsey said there was widespread concern that, to achieve a further
2% in local negotiations, managers would demand cuts in conditions and
areas such as unsocial hours payments.
The RCN wrote to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang over the issue of the
apparently harder stance taken in Scotland than in England, where
Ministers have said money was available in the system to fund the full
3%.
In his reply, Mr Lang said the Scottish NHS had been allocated an
increase of 3.6% and was expected to make a further 2.75% available from
efficiences and other economies.
RCN Scottish secretary June Andrews said: ''What is really inspiring
is the level of public support we have received, but we found Mr Lang's
response very disappointing.
''It really does not take anything forward. It does not require any
great act of imagination just to repeat the party line. What the trusts
really need to know is what is going to be acceptable to the Government,
and he has given them no indication at all.''
Ms Andrews said trust managers had shown no inclination to introduce
local pay bargaining in the last four years, when they have had the
option to do so.
''Managers have not wanted it and do not want it, but Government dogma
is imposing it on them. The sensible way is to pay 3% across the board
and for us to stop arguing and get on with nursing patients,'' she
added.
A series of demonstrations and rallies is planned later this month,
culminating in the handing of a petition to Mr Lang.

A SPECIAL day for Scotland and Watsonians rugby captain Gavin Hastings
was tinged with tragedy yesterday.
One of his closest friends in the game, Watsonians club president
Allan McNish died after suffering a heart attack at his Edinburgh home.
He was 55.
Hastings said: ''I am totally stunned. Allan was one of the great
figures of the game in Scotland, someone who epitomised the spirit of a
club president. He devoted his life to rugby and Watsonians and was a
heck of a nice guy into the bargain.
''What has happened is an absolute tragedy. I'm sure I speak for
everyone in Scottish rugby when I say how sad I am. All my sympathy goes
to the family.''
Mr McNish's death came as it was announced that Hastings was to be
awarded an honorary blue by Heriot-Watt University. The award, believed
to be the first of its kind in Britain, is for the player's contribution
to sport at a national level.
Mr McNish, who was married with two children, had planned to go to
Twickenham to watch Hastings lead Scotland out against England in the
Grand Slam decider on Saturday.
Mr McNish, a chartered surveyor, was a top-rated back-row forward in
his playing days at Myreside and a regular member of the Edinburgh
District side. The highlight of his career was being picked to play for
the Barbarians.
After retiring from playing, he coached Watsonians and the Edinburgh
team against the All-Blacks in 1983. He was also a past-captain of
Mortonhall Golf Club.
Current Watsonians club coach Peter Gallagher said: ''As a president,
Allan performed like he played -- a real grafter. If you wanted
something done quickly and efficiently you asked him. He and Gavin did a
tremendous amount of work together for Watsonians and he and his brother
Scott will be devastated.''
Mr McNish's death comes just 24 hours after that of the father of
former Scotland and British Lions captain, Finlay Calder. Mr Robin
Calder, who was in his seventies, was a former Royal High and Haddington
player.
Meanwhile, before hearing of Mr McNish's death, Heriot-Watt announced
details of their special award to Hastings. It will be presented to him
by Principal Alistair MacFarlane at a ceremony in May.
In a letter to the university, Hastings said the award was a great
honour and he was delighed to accept it. He is the first sportsman or
woman from outside the university to be given such a sporting honour,
which equates with the long established principal of conferring honorary
degrees.
For the last 29 years, Heriot-Watt has been awarding a blue to
students who excel at varsity sports. It was decided to widen the scheme
to make an annual award to someone who had made an outstanding
contribution to sport.
Mr David Mieras, director of physical education at Heriot-Watt, said
the discussions on the honorary blue award had taken place before the
Five Nations tournament so people had not been influenced by the
personal success of Hastings or the Scottish team's victories.
Mr Mieras said the decision to honour a player from outwith the
university was made to get away from ''the ivory tower image, not to be
inward thinking, and to be aware of the sporting world out there''.
The university sports union president, Mr Mark Lucas, said: ''We were
very pleased when Gavin told us he was willing to accept the blue. We
were also particularly pleased at the success he and the Scottish rugby
team have achieved in the Home Nations tournament since we first invited
him to accept. We will be cheering them on at Twickenham on Saturday.''
Professor MacFarlane said: ''Sport plays a very important role in the
life of the university. I am delighted that the sports union has
developed an honorary blue and that such a distinguished sportsman has
agreed to be honoured in this way.''

LABOUR Party nominations for the new Renfrewshire council were rocked
by controversy yesterday when three existing Labour councillors declared
they would stand against official party candidates.
All three will be automatically banned from the party.
Then, to add to the party's problems, Mr Paul Mack, the former deputy
leader of the council who was rejected as an offical Labour candidate
after being convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend, insisted he
would be an official candidate after Labour's original choice suddenly
withdrew hours before the deadline.
When Mr Mack was originally not chosen as a candidate, largely because
of his assault conviction, he appealed to Labour's Scottish headquarters
and was turned down.
However, last night Mr Mack was unrepentant. He said the appeal
committee, consisting of assistant secretary Ms Lesley Quinn, former
Scottish chairwoman Ms Johann Lamont, and executive members Ms Rosina
Macrae and Ms Maureen Pollok, was stacked against him unfairly because
it consisted only of women.
''It's like putting O J Simpson up before the Alabama branch of the Ku
Klux Clan. It went against all the rules of natural justice,'' he said.
It had been thought that Mr Mack's political career was over after he
lost his appeal. Then at lunchtime yesterday, forklift driver Mr James
Taylor, the Labour nomination in the ward, withdrew, citing personal and
work problems.
Mr Mack said: ''The branch secretary hastily convened a meeting of the
Paisley branch executive and it was carried unanimously that I was the
candidate -- given the fact of my personal record in the ward and that I
had always had the support of the branch.
''Mr Taylor pulled out for understandable reasons. You can't say this
was done for my benefit.''
Although Mr Mack says he is the official Labour candidate, Scottish
headquarters disagrees. A spokesman said: ''Paul Mack was not on the
panel and is not an official candidate.''
Adding to Labour's problems is the defiant stand of current Labour
councillors Mr Bobby Stevenson, Mrs Elsie McFaull, and Mr Ken McGinlay.
Mr Stevenson and Mrs McFaull are both committee conveners on Renfrew
District Council.
All three failed to get official nominations for the new Renfrewshire
council, yet all three put themselves forward yesterday. They are up
against official candidates and their future in the Labour Party seems
quite clear cut. ''Anyone standing against an official candidate
automatically resigns their Labour Party membership,'' said the
headquarters spokesman.

Margaret Vaughan looks at the challenges and rewards of oil
exploration off Scotland's west coast
NEW frontiers of oil exploration are opening up to the west of
Scotland. The announcement yesterday that 19 oil companies want to
explore a huge area of the Atlantic heralds an exciting new era for the
industry, according to oil analyst Tim Shinger.
''The new area is relatively virgin,'' says the head of the Petroleum
Services Group for Arthur Anderson: ''It's very exciting.''
The new frontier area forms part of the 17th round of the Government's
oil exploration licensing programme. The companies have nominated a
total of 691 blocks of sea, covering 170,000 square kilometres.
Later in the year, the Government will announce which areas it will
approve for exploration and the oil companies will decide which areas to
bid for. The area in waters west of Scotland is the largest of those
proposed. It is almost equivalent in area to the entire Scottish land
mass.
It is an opportunity which needs to be taken very seriously because it
has the potential to offer big rewards, according to Professor Chengi
Kuo of Strathclyde University.
''No-one can know for certain what reserves there are but it offers
tremendous potential which should not be ignored.'' Professor Kuo
pointed out that the history of the oil industry showed that there was a
tendency to underestimate its benefits. In 1965, he said, people would
have thought it mad to believe Britain's oil industry would be worth
billions 20 years on.
It is not, though, another North Sea. ''For a start, the weather gets
a lot worse out there, more hostile, and the waters are deeper. The
corollary of that is that when you get into the deeper waters in the
outer area, there is a chance of getting bigger fields. Although the
conditions will be more hostile, the rewards will be greater.''
It is also true that the advances in oil technology allow for deeper
waters to be explored, which would have been impossible a few years ago,
and make it more economically viable for oil companies to invest in
exploration.
Exploration in the new frontier area will involve more sophisticated
rigs than those anchored in the North Sea. The rigs required in such
waters, in depths of more than 1000 feet, will be specially designed
dynamically-positioned rigs, held in place by computer.
Will the new area have a significant impact on Britain's ability to
continue as an important oil producer in the 21st century? The industry
remains wary. Optimism is tinged with caution.
It is expected to be about 18 months before exploration can begin.
''It is a shot in the dark,'' an industry source admitted.
It was his guess that the discovery of the Foinaven fields, in waters
west of Shetland, where BP has already been granted a development
licence and which is expected to begin producing later this year, had
prompted the Government to move for further exploration: the oilfield,
120 miles west of Shetland, was hailed as the biggest fillip for the oil
industry since the discovery of Nelson, in 1987.
''But bear in mind that the industry had been exploring to the west of
Shetland for 22 years and had drilled 100 wells before finding
Foinavan.''
Oil analysts say new fields are needed to help buoy UK production as
the older North Sea fields begin to decline. Oil output is expected to
peak at 2.8m barrels a day in 1996 and remain there for several years.
Gareth Davies, of the Heriot Watt University oil research offshoot
IOE, in Orkney, said the exploration was only the first stage in a long
process. In itself it was not indicative of a boom on the horizon or any
change in the industrial climate, he thought. It did, though, indicate a
welcome continuing interest in reserves off the British Isles.
''If they do find oil or gas, it will be three or four years before
developments get off the ground. It won't happen tomorrow. But the
industry is looking for new areas to maintain its production as the
level from existing fields is always declining.''
Over the past 20 years the oil industry had developed an
infrastructure in the North Sea which would not be available in the new
frontier.
BP, for example, proposes tanker loading for the oil drilled at
Foinavan. There is no pipeline. But if significant reserves are found in
the new explorations it could become viable to invest in pipelines and
other infrastructure: ''Certainly any oil that is found in the waters
around Scotland is likely to have potential spin-off in terms of jobs.''
And because the exploration will be in outer waters, it is unlikely to
attract the opposition of environmentalists, Mr Davies added.
In deciding whether to take the risk of exploration, oil companies
would use evidence from seismic surveys to assess the undersea
topography. A dozen or so wells have shown some hopeful signs of finds,
but nothing commercial yet.

A WOMAN, who claimed she was unfairly dismissed by the RAF after
becoming pregnant, has received undisclosed compensation from the
Ministry of Defence.
Miss Moira Smith-Scarth, 40, left the RAF in September 1988 to have a
baby. Her case alleging unfair dismissal on the grounds of sexual
discrimination was to have been heard at the industrial tribunal office
in Aberdeen yesterday. However, she accepted an out-of-court settlement
from the Ministry.
Miss Smith-Scarth, of Promenade Court, Aberdeen, refused to comment as
she left the tribunal office.
Her lawyer, Ms Hazel Bone, described the settlement as
''satisfactory'' but said her client did not want any details of the
case to be made public.
Another woman, Mrs Elaine King, also accepted an out-of-court
settlement for a similar claim.
Mrs King, 34, of Marsh Place, Portlethen, near Aberdeen, is understood
to have agreed terms with the Ministry last Friday.
The two cases were among seven similar industrial tribunals being
heard this week in Aberdeen. Another case is scheduled to be heard
today.

IS this the ideal house for a successful working woman? International
Woman's Week was a reminder of the roles that many women have to juggle
-- career, mother, wife, carer, cook.
Inverlochy, a striking sandstone house in Newlands, is described by
its owner as an ideal home for a working woman who takes her family
responsibilities seriously.
The key selling point of the property is its adjoining lodge, a
flexible feature which can be used as a granny flat, a workspace for a
home-based business, or as a large scale play space for children.
Margaret Cameron has used it for all three. She had the lodge built a
few years so that her elderly mother could be near her.
''I was always very close to my mother, and building the lodge meant
that we could spend a lot of time together,'' she says.
''My mother paid for it and it had to be carefully designed to chime
in with the rest of the house and with the look of the surrounding
area.''
When her mother became ill, Margaret Cameron was able to spend a lot
of time with her while getting on with her own work. ''Many of my
friends are worried about how they will manage to look after their
elderly parents. Women are made to feel very guilty if their mother is
in a nursing home while they are out at work.''
When her mother died, Margaret Cameron moved her public relations and
writing business into the lodge. Which was just as well, because she
soon found herself pregnant for the first time at the age of 45.
''The lodge allowed me to move my computers, files and other equipment
as well as support staff into the lodge, while still keeping in close
touch with the baby.
''International Woman's Week is a powerful reminder that it is women
who wind up doing most of the caring within families. They care for
their children and they care for their elderly relatives. I've been
extremely lucky to be able to do both from a lovely home.''
Inverlochy is at 59 Monteith Road in Newlands. It was feud to
accountant and merchant William Gilmour in 1902. He had the legal papers
drawn up in Buenos Aires and stipulated fine finishes to his home -- a
marble bathroom, stained glass windows and stylish cornices.
In 1979, when Paul Harris and Margaret Cameron became engaged, they
looked for a Glasgow house that would ''work'' for them. No.59 was
chosen, as it was big enough for independent living and working from,
yet compact enough to remain friendly and easily run.
In 1982 Margaret's mother commissioned the Lodge (hence the name
Cameron) from leading Glasgow architect James Cuthbertson. Since 1988,
Margaret has been running her business, Great Scot Media, from there.
No. 59 has five bedrooms, a large lounge, dining room and downstairs
study. The hall is spacious and has been pressed into service for
parties, including a christening celebration attended by 90 people.
There are two bathrooms in the main house, one downstairs and one
upstairs with one of the bedrooms.
There is a massive insulated loft, extensive cellar space, gas central
heating, a video camera door-entry system, security and fire alarm
system, a garage and an Edwardian front garden with a horseshoe driveway
with two double gates.
The Lodge has its own separate front door, gas and electrical system.
A sophisticated phone system means efficient inter-house and outside
communication.

A FORMER Strathclyde policewoman, who raised the biggest sexual
harassment case involving a Scottish police force, yesterday settled her
legal action out of court.
Mrs Ann McIntosh, of Lawrence Street, Glasgow, sued Mr Leslie Sharp,
the chief constable of Strathclyde and a former colleague, Sergeant John
Lees, of Cranstonhill Police Station, Glasgow, for #100,000.
Mrs McIntosh served with the Strathclyde force between July 1989 and
April 1993. She alleged that she suffered a ''major depressive episode''
and reached the view that she had no alternative but to resign from the
force in 1993 because of the way she had been treated.
The chief constable, who is responsible for the actions of his
officers in the course of their employment, and Sergeant Lees denied any
wrongdoing.
In their defences, they said Mrs McIntosh was treated no differently
from any other officer of similar experience under the sergeant's
charge.
The case was set down for an eight-day hearing before Lord Marnoch at
the Court of Session yesterday when Mr Donald Mackay QC, counsel for Mrs
McIntosh, informed the judge that he was not in a position to proceed
with the case at the moment.
The case was then taken off Lord Marnoch's list to wait for another
judge to become available but the Keeper of the Rolls, who decides which
judge hears which case, was later informed by lawyers that the case had
been settled.
The case was not called before another judge.

Kirsty Scott examines the Atlantic hostilities which threaten to erupt
into a fish war
THE jeers and rotten eggs which greeted the arrival of the Spanish
trawler Estai into St John's Harbour, Newfoundland, at the weekend, were
the most visible signs of an unprecedented wave of anger which has
embroiled Canada in a fishing war with the EU.
''We Canadians are not aggressive people,'' Ian Brown, host of CBC's
Sunday Morning told the country. ''Apologising is our national pastime .
. . but we can get mad.''
They are mad because they believe the Estai was overfishing, mad
because fish stocks are disappearing, and mad because the fishing
industry in Atlantic Canada is in serious decline with more than 40,000
jobs lost in recent years.
Canadian officials have argued that they captured the Estai outside
their 200-mile territorial limit under a law, passed last year, which
allows them to seize ships in international waters if they are believed
to be overfishing. Canadian officials argue they must protect fish that
migrate between international and Canadian waters.
The Estai's captain, Enrique Davila Gonzalez, was brought on shore in
front of a crowd of thousands of Newfoundlanders and released on bail by
a judge.
The Canadians' actions -- described as piracy by Spain -- have caused
a diplomatic crisis with the European Union which is worsening by the
day. All official EU contacts with Canada have stopped and EU officials
yesterday effectively accused Canada's Federal Minister for Fisheries
and Oceans, Brian Tobin, of lying. Spain, meanwhile, has said diplomatic
relations with Canada may be severed if the row continues.
EU officials continue to insist that, contrary to Mr Tobin's claims,
the Estai was fishing legally in the Grand Banks and must be freed
before negotiations on the fishing dispute can start.
The Estai incident is the latest turn in a long-running wrangle
between Canada and the EU over Greenland halibut stocks. The two have
been talking about sharing fishing quotas in international waters. The
terms agreed require the EU to cut its haul from 44,000 tonnes of
halibut last year to 27,000 tonnes this year.
The spat between the EU and Canada is also being painted as a conflict
between international law and conservation, with Canada said to be
putting the restoration of fragile fish stocks over generally agreed
conventions of international law.
Brian Tobin, himself a Newfoundlander, claimed at the weekend that he
had found out, by marine radio, that Canada had seized copies of ''clear
instructions'' to the Spanish fleet ''to keep two sets of books''.
''They had agreed to take no more than a 43% catch of Greenland
halibut. They've got almost twice that, 81%, but they're reporting the
difference as skate, ground-fish and other unprotected species,'' he
said.
The EU Commissioner for trade relations with Canada, Sir Leon Brittan,
insisted yesterday that there could be no doubt about the EU's
conservation credentials and urged members states to stand behind Spain
because it could just as well be other countries which were involved in
the dispute.
In Canada, the row has united the disparate fishing communities. Those
involved in the industry have tended to demonstrate against the
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and its cutbacks, surveillance and
moratoria. Now they are backing the DFO to the hilt.
The support is strongest in Newfoundland, which is one of Canada's
poorest provinces and where fishing is central to its very existence.
''In Cod We Trust'' has become the unofficial motto of the region.
The isolated fishing communities around its coast have been suffering
steady population loss for decades, but this has become more dramatic
since last year's moratorium on cod fishing. Recent studies have shown a
huge increase in children staying in school and going on to
post-secondary education to make sure they have the training for jobs
elsewhere.
However, not all Canadians believe their fisheries' problems are the
result of outside interference.
''The reality is that Canada -- much more than foreigners -- has done
most of the overfishing,'' said Owen Myers, a fisheries lawyer and a
former inspector with the DFO. ''In fact, Canada gives permits and
allows overfishing, even today, in its own territorial waters.
''You want an example? Shrimp off Labrador. Not only is it overfished,
but they also take tonnes of turbot, cod and immature mullet, thanks to
nets with holes smaller than a quarter. Before accusing the Spaniards of
fishing with nylon stockings you have to go on board our own trawlers.''
While Spain escalates the war of words and sends patrol vessels to the
area, the 18 other Spanish trawlers in the region have withdrawn.
Mounting Spanish anger over the incident has been illustrated in
cartoons in the country's daily newspapers. One, in a Madrid daily,
showed a map of Canada embossed with a skull and crossbones.
While the EU continues to stand firmly behind the Spanish, however,
there has been deep unease among some members at the extent to which the
Spanish, with an appalling record of rule-breaking, are continuing to
pursue dwindling fish stocks. The Spanish fleet has a reputation for
pushing the legal limits and has had several confrontations over the
years.
Mr Tom Hay, of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, said
that they were watching the dispute from a distance, but would come out
strongly in favour of the Canadians.
''We fully support them in every way. It's not only the Spanish, it's
anybody that's creating this overfishing. I reckon that the stand taken
by the Canadian government is right. A lot of fishermen have said we
should back the Canadians all the way.''
Mr Hay said he did not agree with accusations that Canada is
responsible for the disappearing stocks themselves.
''Their boats are all tied up. They can't be overfishing.''

FEW house buyers have got the measure of metrication, yet changes in
surveying practices mean that an increasing number of property brochures
will drop the old imperial measures that most Britons grew up with.
A survey of 400 people carried out by the National Association of
Estate Agents' Homelink service reveals bewilderment about the yardstick
-- should that be metrestick? -- with which the rest of Europe measures
its property.
Respondents were presented with metric descriptions of property and
asked what their equivalents were in feet and inches, miles and gallons.
Some of those questioned thought a 500-litre central heating oil
storage tank could be filled with a mere 10 gallons, while others
believed 1000 gallons was nearer the mark. Only about 30% of the sample
came close by guessing that 100 gallons would be about right, near
enough when the correct answer is 110 gallons.
When asked how far, in miles, you would have to cycle to the station
if it was seven kilometres away, answers ranged from one-and-a-half mile
dawdle to a tiring 12. The correct answer is just under 4.5 miles.
When asked how big a 0.1-hectare garden was, answers ranged far and
wide. Estimates went all the way from one tenth on an acre to a
staggering ten acres. The actual answer is one quarter of an acre.
Then came the chance to get the measure of the mighty metre.
When asked how much space there was in a room that measured 4.25
metres by 2.75 metres some estimates did not leave enough room to swing
a cat.
One respondent thought that it was equivalent to 3ft by 2ft 9in. At
the other end of the scale, another respondent reckoned 24ft by 18ft was
more like it. The correct answer is 13ft 11in by 9ft.
Trevor Kent, a past president of the NAEA and compiler of the survey's
results, said: ''I've long had the suspicion that few people really
understand metres.
''Certainly whenever I show house-buyers a floor plan in metres, they
always ask me to convert to feet and inches. Never in my career have I
been asked to convert any imperial measurement to metric.
''Our survey proves the point, and it just goes to show that the
Government's insistence that we go metric is out of step with the
public.''
If we are out of step with the most of the rest of the world, are we
putting a foot or a metre wrong?

AN AIDE to Home Secretary Michael Howard who caused #1600 worth of
damage to three vehicles after taking an unmarked Special Branch police
car following a lunchtime drink was ordered yesterday to do 100 hours'
community service.
Ms Janine Barnes, 26, who was responsible for Mr Howard's diary, was
also banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay compensation
for the damage.
She had pleaded guilty at Camberwell Magistrates Court, south London,
at an earlier hearing to aggravated vehicle taking at New Scotland Yard
last November 25.
Ms Barnes -- who now faces the prospect of losing her job -- also
admitted a drink driving charge and driving without insurance in The
Broadway, Victoria. The case had been adjourned for reports before
sentencing yesterday.
Magistrate Mrs Lorraine Morgan told Ms Barnes: ''I am dealing with
very serious offences, matters involving damage to property and
potential risk to members of the public that particular afternoon.
''But in view of all that I've heard and read, I do not consider that
you are a person who is likely to be before the courts again or presents
a future danger to the public.''
The court had heard that Ms Barnes, of Welling, south-east London,
went out for a lunchtime drink and drank a bottle of wine.
Afterwards she went for a walk and found herself outside New Scotland
Yard, where she followed a pedal cyclist through a security gate.
She got into a Ford Mondeo, which she then reversed into a Vauxhall
Cavalier parked in another bay, which collided into a second Cavalier.
Ms Barnes hit the two vehicles a second time before driving at speed
out of the basement.
She abandoned the vehicle a few miles away in Clapham High Street,
south London, then hitched a lift on a lorry to Brixton police station,
where she went to the front counter and reported the loss of her
handbag.
Ms Barnes was seen shouting at a police car as it entered the station
on her departure, and was then arrested as she tried to stop traffic on
the busy A23 road at the front of the station.
She told officers she had stolen a car from New Scotland Yard.
Mr Richard Lewis, defending, told the court that at the time of the
offence Ms Barnes had a position of great responsibility and was often
working 12 hours a day, not taking a break for lunch.
''She suffered a minor breakdown, exacerbated by the alcohol.''
He added: ''She has been suspended from her work, pending the sentence
of this court. A disciplinary hearing will take place in the near
future. It seems likely from the disciplinary code of the Home Office
that she will lose her job.''

THE Western Isles Council is unlikely to attempt to renovate any more
old buildings after estimated costs of converting a former school in
Stornoway into a museum rose from #50,000 to more than #800,000.
The council's arts and leisure committee yesterday considered a report
from its chief executive, Mr Brian Stewart, on the conversion of the
Francis Street building which was used by the Nicolson Institute,
Stornoway's senior secondary school, until four years ago.
In his report, which will be considered again along with other reports
next month, Mr Stewart recommends: ''The council adopt a policy
presumption against the conversion of old buildings and any such
conversion works only be considered when a comparison of the cost of new
build has been carried out and conversion works are confirmed to be the
most appropriate vehicle for achieving the council's objectives.''
However, Mr Stewart emphasises that the apparently dramatic rise in
estimated costs can be explained. Reports had been submitted in June
1991 setting out the design and financial implications: ''The estimated
cost of these works was stated as #49,686 but these works included only
very basic conversion work to provide display and exhibition facilities
and general redecoration.
''It did not include any repair or maintenance work to the external
fabric of the building. It is therefore not valid to compare these costs
with the final costs (#837,362 gross) of what turned out to be a very
different project.''
The decision to move the museum from Stornoway's Town Hall to Francis
Street had been driven by a decision to establish a Lifestyle/Drop In
Centre in the former. Little consideration had been given to the
suitability of the school building.
Mr Stewart's report finds that at no time was a properly costed and
clearly expressed programme of work drawn up for the conversion.
''In these circumstances one is faced with a 'chicken and egg'
situation in that the precise nature of the works could not be
quantified because the financial resources were not known, while at the
same time the financial resources could not be determined because the
precise nature of the work was not known.
''It was not until June 1993 when the full extent of the repair work,
which was necessary to the building, became known that a proper
assessment could be made of the scale of the work required, its likely
cost and the probable timescale. This was some 27 months after the
initial decision to relocate the museum to the Francis Street site.''

A SOLICITOR is threatening to sue a firm of sheriff officers for
sending ''illegal'' poll tax poinding notices to more than 200 Glasgow
addresses.
Mr Gordon Dangerfield, who has successfully defended more than 35
community charge cases, claims that the notices sent by William G Kay &amp;
Co. on behalf of Strathclyde Regional Council have no legal standing
because they quote a wrong section of the Debtors (Scotland) Act.
He also claims the sheriff officers used sharp practice by sending
demands which gave vague dates of the poindings and which were not
delivered until the day before the threatened recovery action.
He says he will act for recipients, who have grounds to sue for
damages for lost earnings and distress.
However, William G Kay claims the poinding notices abide by the law
and were entrusted to the Post Office in good time for delivery.
The demand letters, date-stamped by the sheriff officers on February
21, were posted to more than 200 poll tax defaulters in Cambuslang and
Rutherglen. They threatened forced entry and poinding of goods ''seven
days after the date of the notice''.
Each letter was headed: ''Arrears of Community Charge (Poll Tax)
Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 Paragraph 18(1).''
Mr Dangerfield told The Herald: ''These demands are ridiculous. There
is no such thing as Paragraph 18(1) of the Debtors (Scotland) Act. There
is a Section 18, but that deals with provisions for debts other than the
poll tax.
''They should have quoted Schedule 5, paragraph 3(i) if they wanted to
carry out a poinding for non-payment of poll tax. As they stand, the
notices have absolutely no substance in law.''
Mr Dangerfield also claims that the failure to give a poinding date
was ''a blatant attempt to mislead''. He added that either ''sharp
practice'' or a ''cock-up'' led to the six-day delay in the notices
being delivered.
''Dozens of people panicked when they received these notices and
stayed in to avoid having their house broken into by the sheriff
officers,'' he added, ''In my opinion, they definitely have grounds to
sue for damages.''
A statement by William G Kay says that Section 18(1) of the Debtors
(Scotland) Act gives the same provision for poindings as Schedule 5
3(i). It also claims that Schedule 5 is applicable only in summary
warrant cases.
The company says that the notices were entrusted on February 21 to the
Royal Mail, which was responsible for their safe delivery.
A spokeswoman for the Anti-Poll Tax Federation said: ''No-one who
contacted us received their notices before Monday February 27. However,
we are only aware of two poindings, which took place in Whitlawburn.''
Strathclyde Regional Council said it was happy that the sheriff
officers had abided by the requirements of legislation and believed the
demand letters were in order.

<HEADLINE>Dwarf junipers play large role for superquarry</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979386615</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RARE dwarf junipers proved the focus of attention at the public
inquiry into the Lingerbay superquarry yesterday.
It was revealed they had been found on the mountain which is to be
excavated.
The 65th day of the inquiry heard that a survey carried out last year
by Scottish Natural Heritage, the principal objectors, had identified 28
different vegetation community types at Mount Roineabhalon on Harris, of
which seven were apparently confined to that site.
These were particularly rich in mosses and liverworts.
The rare patch of dwarf juniper (H 15) is claimed to be new to the
Outer Hebrides.
However, Mr Bryan Sage, an ecological consultant for the developers of
the #70m coastal superquarry, Redland Aggregates Ltd, said that given
the small size of some of the National Vegetation Classification
communities he questioned whether it was reasonable to use these as a
basis for objecting to a major development.
Referring to the survey carried out for Scottish Natural Heritage and
which had identified the small patches of the dwarf juniper, Mr Sage
said his argument was that no detailed survey had been carried out in
the rest of Lewis and Harris to find small communities of H 15.
He added: ''It may be we could find similar communities if they were
looked for with the same degree of effort.''
Mr Sage said that after an initial ecological survey in 1990 he
concluded that the loss of habitat that would result from the
development was acceptable in ecological terms.
He said this was accepted by the Nature Conservancy Council for
Scotland, the forerunner to the Scottish Natural Heritage.
He said otters were present at Lingerbay, but their temporary
displacement as a result of quarrying operations was considered to be of
no ecologial importance.
He said the post-development landscape would include new cliffs and
ledges, providing opportunities for colonisation by plants and seabirds.
''With a development of this magnitude there are going to be a number
of entries on the debit side of the ledger.''
The inquiry continues.

Ian Sutherland reports how Highland communities switched on to a
pioneering local radio station and quickly took it to their hearts
HEARTLAND FM -- Britain's first small-scale independent local radio
service -- celebrates its third birthday next week. From its Pitlochry
base it broadcasts to 5500 listeners in places like Dunkeld and
Aberfeldy in Highland Perthshire.
The tiny station, licensed by the Radio Authority, is run by
volunteers, backed by a 50-50 mix of commercial activity and
community-based fund raising.
It broadcasts for 50 hours each week. All material is produced
in-house. Unlike most independent stations, it does not use ''sustaining
services'' from London.
Heartland -- housed in cramped offices at Pitlochry's Curling Rink --
is poised for bigger things. Advertising revenue has grown steadily. It
aims to operate an all-day service, seven days a week. The first
national advertiser could be about to sign up.
''The only constraints now are physical,'' says founder and programme
controller Brendan Murphy. ''We're looking to expand and recapitalise.''
They had to meet the same professional and business criteria imposed
on major ventures such as Radio Clyde, Virgin FM, ScotFM, Classic FM, or
Talk UK. The Radio Authority has no room for sentiment.
''We needed #25,000 to start. We got our licence on condition we
raised it in six months. We actually raised #32,000 in 11 weeks.
Basically, we got it by buttering scones.''
Heartland still raises funds by selling home-made chutney. It has also
pioneered a tourism-linked series of concerts featuring top-line folk
and traditional artists, recorded for later broadcasting. It's hoped to
begin live transmission of concerts.
The McCalmans, Dick Gaughan, Old Blind Dogs and Wolfstone have given
support. Sales of high-quality tapes help keep Heartland on air.
Grass-roots activity produces impressive statistics. On Sundays,
petrol pump attendant Leigh Crighton -- ''I came in to make coffee and
was taped'' -- presents Heartland's Sunny Afternoon show.
Recently Leigh received 210 calls during the three-hour show. ''And
that was the ones who got through. We've only got one phone line.
Extrapolated nationally, it would have meant BBC Radio Scotland
receiving 210,000 calls during one show.''
Heartland's message could be spreading too. Peat merchant Iain
Gillespie cites a survey in Perth which suggested that one per cent of
the population might be tuning in to Heartland.
''That's about 500 people outside our official area. We also get calls
from Killin and Forfar, about 40 miles away.'' The station has been
picked up in Belfast, by a listener who believed he was hearing BBC
Radio Scotland.
Other communities seem to be echoing Heartland's founding principles
of broadcasting to communities from within that community. North-East
Community Radio has begun at Inverurie, north-west of Aberdeen. Nevis
Radio is up and running in Fort William.
Activists are examining possibilities in locations as diverse as Ross
and Cromarty, Angus, and Campbeltown.
There are print parallels. Twenty years ago radical ex-students set up
the Skye-based West Highland Free Press. In 1970s Aberdeen
heritage-orientated activists founded Leopard Magazine. It's been in the
wars, but it's still there.
In Glasgow and Edinburgh community papers have sprung up. Last year,
in Aberdeen, a tiny group of writers heard rumours that US-owned
publishers planned a Sunday paper for the North and North-east.
The group rushed out the tabloid Silver City on Sunday -- which still
appears once a month. The Aberdonians funded their venture by selling
remaindered books.
Heartlands is a mixture of artistic aspiration, community commitment
and hard-headed commercialism. Australian broadcasters have used
Heartland as a model for reaching expatriate Scots.
A slice of Pitlochry's output goes to a station in Tennessee -- where
it's rebroadcast as Keltic Korner. Volunteer Linda Moyes says: ''We're
getting better. We're more professional, slicker. People are developing
their skills. We're constantly looking for ways to improve.''

<HEADLINE>New super concrete can withstand earthquakes</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH scientists have developed a new super concrete -- four times
the strength of the ordinary variety -- which can withstand massive
earthquake tremors.
Supercrete has been developed at Dundee University and is reinforced
with an outside wall of steel, which absorbs the energy produced by
earthquakes.
The material is now going ahead for further tests to analyse how
designers can use it in large constructions.
Dr Rod Jones, of the university's civil engineering department, said:
''It has amazing properties. This is a high-performance material -- it
is like the difference between a penny-farthing and a Ferrari.''
He added: ''It is early days yet. But, if Supercrete fulfils its early
promise and can be fully harnessed, it could have a radical effect on
the construction industry.''
Trials at the university have been carried out on the new material
with a machine made from the 12-inch thick steel armour of Second World
War German Tiger tanks.
Dr Jones said: ''The reinforcement is outside, rather than inside the
concrete, so that it is able to absorb the energy forces produced by
earthquakes potentially better than normal concrete.''
Dr Jones added that the concrete was particularly suited to bridge
construction.
The development of Supercrete is a joint project between Dundee
University and local companies John Fyfe Readymix and Brown &amp; Tawse.

<HEADLINE>Test may have avoided death of baby, says sheriff</HEADLINE>

THE death of a baby might have been avoided if the doctor supervising
her birth had taken a pH test from her scalp in the course of the birth.
This might have indicated that baby Helen Allan was in severe
distress, leading to her birth much earlier than actually transpired,
said Sheriff Graeme Warner in his determination following a fatal
accident inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court earlier this year.
Sheriff Warner said this might have improved Helen's chances of
survival although the extent of any permanent damage was ''purely a
matter of speculation''.
Helen was born on March 8, 1993, at the city's maternity hospital. Her
mother, Mrs Ann Allan, 33, of King Street, Aberdeen, was admitted on
March 7, 13 days past her expected delivery date. She earlier told the
inquiry she had ''exploded into labour'' after being given Prosten Gel
to induce her.
Helen died on the morning of March 14 of acute lack of oxygen around
the time of her birth and blood loss.
Sheriff Warner said the major single defect which contributed most to
the failure of Dr Steven Benett, who supervised Helen's birth, to carry
out a pH test was that Mrs Allan's case history was not transferred with
her from Somerfield ward to the labour ward.
Sheriff Warner said Dr Bennett was ''to some considerable extent
fighting in the dark''. He had not been told the principle reason for
Mrs Allan's removal from Somerfield ward was a very serious feotal heart
rate monitor tracing.
''It appeared to be so very unsatisfactory as to require immediate
medical attention. They accordingly thought it appropriate to send her
down to the labour ward where she could receive such attention and
whatever action the examining midwife or doctor thought appropriate.
''What actually happened when Mrs Allan arrived in the labour ward was
that a nursing auxilliary received her without any indication whatsoever
having been given that there was any particular problem, so that she was
simply placed into the ward and waited for a full hour before being seen
by Dr Bennett.''
The sheriff said nothing could be drawn from the lack of continuous
electronic monitoring of the foetus although he noted that, following
Helen's death, special four-bedded wards were set up at the hospital for
women whose labour has been induced so they could be constantly
electronically monitored and be under constant care from a midwife.
The sheriff said he considered this ''a very definite plus'' for women
in Grampian region. He recommended it be a requirement that, where a
patient was transferred from one area of a hospital to another, the
delivering staff handed over a ''potted history'' and any significant
points so receiving staff could start off in a fully informed position.
The sheriff continued: ''I could not possibly say that had this course
of action been taken here, the result would have been any different but
it is at least possible that it might have been and that, in something
as precious, valuable, and important as the birth of a child, must
surely be an aim to be striven for.''
Mrs Allan's solicitor, Mr David Burnside, said he had lodged a
compensation claim against Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust before the
fatal accident inquiry. Mrs Allan and the trust had decided to wait for
the outcome before proceeding further.

A FORUM aimed at improving businesses by making them aware of the
capabilities of high-tech communications systems has been launched in
Grampian region.
The region is taking the lead in Europe, aiming to establish the
North-east of Scotland as a centre of excellence in telematics --
communications and computer technology -- and to help companies big and
small to create jobs.
Nest, the North East Scotland Telematics Forum, is being supported by
Grampian Enterprise, BT, Grampian Regional Council and Moray, Badenoch
and Strathspey Enterprise Company.
Its objectives are to increase awareness of the implications and
potential benefits of telematics for individuals, organisations and the
local economy, to raise the level of skills and technical understanding
of individuals.
A steering committee member, Mr Stan Averell, the project services
manager for oil service company AOC International, said there was a good
example in Forres where a company which at the moment has 50 employees
but is expected to have 500 by the end of next year, processes parking
tickets for London boroughs.
All the information travels over lines to computers in Forres where
the accounts are prepared, sent out to offenders, and the cheques are
sent back.
Grampian region's telematic executive, Ms Debra Lee, said: ''We are
trying to create the right environment to attract new businesses to the
area but also the forum will enable existing businesses, especially very
small businesses in rural areas, to identify new opportunities and new
ways of doing business, especially new ways of marketing and selling.''
A leading Grampian businessman, Mr Maitland Mackie, the chairman of
Grampian Enterprise said: ''In the old days you had to create roads and
railways. Now with telematics we are actually creating an infrastructure
of information flows and if we do it better and faster than our major
competitive areas then our industry will grow and therefore there will
be jobs.''

THE Government's proposals for running Loch Lomond and the Trossachs
were dismissed yesterday by Lady Glasgow, chairwoman of the Scottish
Council for National Parks.
The voluntary local authority joint committee suggested on Monday by
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office Environment Minister, came, she said,
as little surprise.
She was deeply dismayed at what she called a ''half-hearted proposal
which will essentially be no more than what is already in existence and
which has demonstrably been unable to protect and manage adequately the
outstanding qualities of the Loch Lomond area''.
It would still be left to the individual local authorities to agree on
co-ordinated local action. It would still be left to them to decide on
whether or not to agree voluntarily to a joint local plan.
As they had seen in the past, the degree of priority and commitment
assigned to the joint management and protection of Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs by the individual councils was variable.
The Loch Lomond Working Party, in spite of its restricted remit, had
recommended a joint board with planning powers.
''The Government has set this aside. It has opted instead for a weak
voluntary mechanism which will be vulnerable to the varying priorities
of the existing local authorities and clearly at risk of breaking down
with the advent of local government reorganisation.
''I am sure my dismay will be widely shared locally where there have
been strong calls for a Loch Lomond-Trossachs national park.
''The Government's proposals will be of concern to our European and
international colleagues who have already said they would wish to see
Scotland introducing legally-established, European-style national parks
to internationally accepted standards. This is clearly the only
long-term solution,'' she said.
Lady Glasgow added that the outcome of 18 months of Government delay
would be bitterly disappointing for all those who had worked over so
many years to secure an outstanding area for future generations.
''The lessons of history have been totally ignored and the popular
campaign for a Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park will undoubtedly
continue,'' she said.

RESIDENTS in the Fife village of Freuchie are meeting tomorrow to
discuss the contamination of their water supply which made around half
of them ill.
As investigations into the cause of the outbreak continued yesterday,
estimates of those affected by sickness and diarrhoea rose to 500.
Mr Tony Cran, chairman of Freuchie Community Council, said: ''There is
a lot of feeeling about this in the village. A lot of people were sick
and we want some answers.''
He said there were basic questions of the mechanisms of how it
happened, the level of contamination, and what action was being taken to
prevent a recurrence.
''We also want to know, if there was culpability, what action is being
taken,'' he added.
Inquiries have concentrated on Kettle Produce which washes vegetables.
When its own spring was shut down last week for maintenance, it drew
water from Freuchie Burn, itself probably polluted by discharges from a
sewage works upstream, for the first wash and mains water for the final
wash and rinse.
It is believed some valves and pipework could have been altered which
allowed an accidental, pressurised blow-back into the main which serves
the village.
Mr Alban Denton, operations director at Kettle Produce, said the
company was co-operating fully with Fife Regional Council water
engineers to establish the cause.
''It is obviously a risk that it could be in our operation but we are
not the only operation that could be involved,'' he said. ''If we had
suspected it was contaminated, we would never have considered using the
burn water.''
Mr Denton said all links with the public water supply had been
severed.
Dr Mike Roworth, consultant in public health for Fife Health Board,
said it appeared a virus had caused the outbreak of gastroenteritis and
tests were being carried out in Edinburgh to identify it. Questionnaires
will be delivered to establish how many people were affected.

POLICE were last night hunting two teenage gunmen who held a Paisley
family hostage for several hours after threatening to shoot two
policemen.
The youths broke into the family's tenement flat via the roof space
after escaping from police.
Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector John McGowan said that Mr Jason
Kerr, his wife Louise and their three-year-old son Joshua had been
''severely traumatised'' by their experience, which began around 8pm on
Monday.
DCI McGowan said the family had been in the living room of their
Clarence Street tenement flat when they heard a noise in the hallway.
They opened the door to be confronted by the two youths, who had
broken through the ceiling after entering the roof space via a loft door
in the corridor outside.
The family were held hostage for two and a half hours. The teenagers
then escaped in the family's white Vauxhall Astra, which was later
discovered in Paisley's Gallowhill area.
Earlier, the youths, who had been riding a motor cycle, threatened to
shoot two traffic officers during a three-minute chase.
Police constables John Orr, 26, and 32-year-old Ross Campbell had been
on patrol in an unmarked car when they spotted the pair behaving
suspiciously in Paisley's Howard Street around 7.30pm.
The youths sped off when challenged by the officers, who followed by
car for two minutes until the youths fell off the white Suzuki and ran
off on foot, scaling a wall.
PC Orr said: ''We ran after them for about 50 feet and I was about
five yards behind the pillion passenger when he turned round and pulled
out a handgun.''
The youth then screamed at the police officers to get back whilst the
other climbed a fence. He then passed the handgun over the fence to the
other youth who kept it trained on the officers whilst he scaled it.
Once over the fence, the youths ran off and PC Orr and his colleague
had to give up their pursuit.
A number of officers immediately searched the surrounding area but
could not find the youths, who were holding the Kerr family hostage at
this point.
It was the first time PC Orr, who has been in the force for six years,
had been confronted by a gunman.
The traffic constable, who works out of Glasgow, said: ''The danger we
were in didn't really sink in till later that night when I went home.
''When the youth pulled out the handgun I could see straight away it
was a real gun and so I backed off.
''There was nothing I could do,'' added PC Orr, who is a member of
Strathclyde Police's recreational pistol association.
DCI McGowan appealed for witnesses to contact the Paisley station on
0141 889 1113, and was confident of a good response.
The youths, aged 17 to 19 and around 5ft 9ins in height, were wearing
white helmets, denim trousers, trainers and one wore a green blouson
jacket whilst the other wore a black blouson jacket.
DCI McGowan said that efforts were still being made to trace the owner
of the white Suzuki motor cycle.
The Kerr family were last night being looked after by friends and have
been offered counselling.
DCI McGowan also disclosed that police were following definite lines
of inquiry into two separate shooting incidents in Pailey on Sunday but
he denied suggestions that individuals in the town were carrying
firearms as a matter of course.
There have been six shootings in the town in the last six or seven
weeks, he said. There were various factions in the town dealing in
drugs, he added, but there was no indication that Monday's incident was
connected to the drug trade.

A MAN stabbed a doctor to death in revenge for failing to diagnose his
sister's cancer, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Andrew Wylie got the address of the surgery in Airdrie from a
telephone book, the High Court in Glasgow was told, and went there with
a kitchen knife.
The jury heard that, as Dr Donald MacKay was repeatedly stabbed, his
daughter, a receptionist in the practice, hauled the attacker off by the
hair and grappled with him before he escaped.
Mr Wylie, 33, who has been committed to the State Hospital at
Carstairs, denies murdering Dr MacKay in his surgery at Bank House
Medical Centre, East High Street, Airdrie, on October 19 last year. It
is alleged that he repeatedly stabbed the doctor on the head and body.
Dr MacKay's daughter, Laura, 25, told how she twice heard her father
shout: ''Help me'' and dashed into his office. She found him lying on
the floor, shielding his face, as he was being stabbed by a stranger.
Ms MacKay told Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, that she grabbed the
attacker by the hair and pulled him off, saving her father from further
knife blows.
As they were struggling, one of the patients came to the door, and the
man escaped.
Mrs Pauline Amos, 31, of School Quadrant, Rochsoles, Airdie, told the
court that she saw Mr Wylie stabbing the doctor. Describing the
attacker, she said: ''He never said anything. He just looked at me
straight in the face and carried on.''
Mrs Amos said that the doctor was on the floor, with Mr Wylie grabbing
his shoulder with one hand as he stabbed him with the other.
Afterwards Dr MacKay was taken out of his office and sat down on a
chair in the receptionist's room. Ms MacKay, who had been screaming,
went over to the doctor and told him: ''Don't die, dad.''
Another patient, 52-year-old Mr James Campbell, of Connor Street,
Clarkston, Airdrie, told how he was sitting with the doctor when Mr
Wylie walked into the room and asked if he was Dr MacKay.
Mr Campbell said that Mr Wylie also asked him: ''Did you know Mary?''
Mr Wylie, he said, then walked towards the doctor and pulled out a knife
with a 10-inch blade.
Mr Campbell said he dashed out of the room to get help, and thought of
getting a broom. But, when he got back, Mr Wylie was escaping.
Under cross-examination by defence counsel Gordon Jackson, QC, Mr
Campbell was accused of lying when he insisted that Mr Wylie asked about
Mary and not Ann.
Steven Queen, a 14-year-old friend of Mr Wylie's nephew, Kevin Rooney,
15, told the court of Mr Wylie's alleged confession to killing the
doctor.
He and other boys went with Mr Wylie to an area known as The Burn,
where Mr Wylie drank two bottles of Buckfast wine and two cans of beer.
Steven said: ''He was laughing at first, and I didn't think he was
telling the truth. But, once we started talking, I believed him.
''He said that his sister had cancer and she was in stage one. She
went to Dr MacKay, and he said it was only woman's nerves.
''She changed her doctor, who said it was at stage three -- and if Dr
MacKay had checked out she would be here today.''
Steven claimed that Mr Wylie told him his sister was too young to die
and described how he got the address of the doctor's practice from the
phone book and went to the surgery with a knife.
He made whooshing noises as he described how he stabbed the doctor.
Steven said that Mr Wylie was heavily bloodstained on his face and
hands and told how he burned his jacket.
He said that, when they parted, Mr Wylie told him: ''I am not going to
harm anyone who doesn't do any harm to my family. Anyone who does harm
to my family will get the same as Dr MacKay got.''
Earlier Kevin Rooney, from Plains, Airdrie, told how his uncle washed
the blood from his hands and face in the burn and confessed to ''doing
the doctor''.
Mr Wylie, he said, told him about the death from cancer of his Auntie
Ann eight years ago and claimed that Dr MacKay did nothing.
The trial, before Lord Murray, continues.

DENTIST Michael Evans sexually assaulted a female patient after
putting her under anaesthetic in his surgery.
Evans, 27, insisted on giving the young woman an evening appointment
when she went for treatment for a broken tooth. He sent away his female
nurse during the treatment at his surgery in Banchory, Kincardineshire,
in January.
Stonehaven Sheriff Court heard yesterday that Evans had felt the
woman's right breast and touched her pubic hair as she came round from
the anaesthetic. As she headed for the door, he tried to force her to
touch his groin area.
He later told police he had been trying to retrieve one of his
instruments which he had dropped down the back of the patient's neck.
Evans, of Davidson Drive, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, admitted
indecently assaulting the woman. His defence counsel, Ms Frances
McMenamin, QC, said her client was guilty of a ''gross betrayal of
trust''.
Procurator-fiscal Ernest Barbour said the victim had made an
appointment with Evans after trying other dental surgeries in Banchory.
''He told her he would prefer to put her to sleep rather than have a
mouth injection. She accepted that and also an evening appointment,''
said Mr Barbour.
Evans, he said, told the woman the treatment would last one hour and
suggested a time for her fiance to pick her up. Mr Barbour said Evans
gave the woman an injection and a sedative in the presence of a female
nurse but sent her away during the treatment.
He added: ''As the victim was coming round, she became aware of
Evans's hand on her right shoulder. It then went below her sweatshirt
and was covering her right breast.
''She sat up and he moved his hand back to her shoulder and told her
to sit back down. She lay back and felt his hand slip from her waist,
below her jeans and pants, to her pubic hair.
''She began to walk out of the room and he supported her. He then took
her hand and attempted to place it in the area of his penis but she
resisted this,'' said Mr Barbour.
When police asked Evans if there was a code of conduct for dentists
when they were treating female patients, he replied he should have had a
woman with him.
Sentence on Evans was deferred until April 18 for social inquiry and
community service reports.
The Crown accepted a not guilty plea from Evans on a similar charge,
alleged to have taken place in the same surgery but involving a
different woman, in July of last year.
The Scottish secretary of the British Dental Association, Mr Alistair
McLean, said it was likely Evans would be struck off. The case would be
raised at the next disciplinary meeting of the association's general
medical council.

<HEADLINE>Scots scientists dispute mattress cot deaths theory</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979386625</RECORDNO>

TESTS carried out by Scottish scientists have contradicted the theory
that cot death is caused by babies breathing antimony fumes from their
mattresses.
The research was commissioned by the Scottish Cot Death Trust after a
Cook Report on ITV last November suggested that antimony -- used as a
fire retardant in mattress materials -- could be a cause of cot death,
or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
The programme led to fire-retardant mattresses being withdrawn from
stock by major chain stores, and suggestions that worried parents should
tape polythene over their babies' mattresses -- advice not supported by
the UK's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kenneth Calman.
Last night Dr Angus Gibson, chairman of the trust, said they were now
leaning towards Dr Calman's view, although he admitted the link with
fire retardant chemicals -- supposedly released as vapour in a chemical
reaction with babies' urine -- could be difficult to disprove
completely.
''The scientist who came up with the theory, Dr Barry Richardson,
might argue that antimony was only a marker and that the damage was done
by phosphene gas, a by-product of the phosphorus compound which is also
used,'' said Dr Gibson.
That proposition is that phosphene reaches a fatal level in the
infant's system, but leaves no trace to be found on post-mortem
examination. However, I understand that scientists from Porton Down have
advised a Government inquiry team that this is unlikely.
The role of antimony was put to the test by Professor Gordon Fell, at
the Department of Biochemistry at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and Dr Allan
Howatson, a pathologist at the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Using liver tissue samples from 25 cot death infants and 25 who had
died from other established causes, they applied more sensitive
techniques than those used by the Cook Report researchers, and found
antimony in all the samples at levels that would be expected in healthy
subjects.
Similar antimony levels were found in both the cot death and control
group -- in fact, the levels in the cot death babies were marginally
lower.
Professor Fell said last night: ''I think we can say we have analysed
a reasonably representative group -- Dr Howatson selected the samples
and we analysed them, blind to which was which.''
Samples were also sent for independent confirmation by scientists at
Southampton University, and the results tallied.
''The trouble with the tests carried out for the Cook Report is that
they could not find any antimony at all in some of the samples, and they
happened to be mostly in the control group,'' Professor Fell said.
''But we are talking about nanograms here, tiny amounts -- it is one
of the challenges of modern analytical chemistry.
''In fact, if you use a sensitive enough method, you will find it --
research carried out by the MacAuley Institute in Aberdeen some years
ago showed traces of antimony in the liver of foetuses.
''The best advice is contained in the Back to Sleep Campaign, which
recommends that babies should sleep on their backs, and there is new
evidence reinforcing the view that smoking by parents is the most
strongly associated factor of all.''

<TEXT>
THE 10-year-old cancer victim refused treatment by a health authority
was responding well yesterday to a course of chemotherapy paid for by an
anonymous donor.
Child B was thrown into the centre of a legal battle when Cambridge
Health Authority decided not to fund her #75,000 treatment for leukemia.
Last Friday the Court of Appeal upheld a judge's ruling that the
health authority was legally justified in refusing to pay for the
treatment.
But then an anonymous benefactor offered to put up the cash -- and
yesterday the girl started a five-day course of intensive chemotherapy
at the private Portland Hospital for Women and Children in London.
The blood specialist in charge of her treatment said she was bearing
up well to the powerful drugs being drip-fed into her.
Consultant haemotologist Dr Peter Gravett, speaking at a news
conference at the London Clinic which will share the girl's treatment,
said: ''So far there haven't been any adverse effects at all. It hasn't
even affected her appetite.
''Chemotherapy is a very individual thing and some people are more
sensitive to it than others.''
Earlier, he had warned that the girl could feel very sick from the
drugs, which are being administered for about six hours a day. Mouth
ulcers, diarrhoea and hair loss were likely side effects.
Three weeks after the end of the treatment, doctors will assess how
well the girl's bone marrow has responded.
A decision will then be taken on whether she is well enough to go to
the next stage of treatment -- a bone marrow transplant.
Alternatively, doctors may decide to give her more chemotherapy -- or
to cease her treatment if it appears to be having no positive effect.
Dr Gravett said the girl's nine-year-old sister would be the ideal
marrow donor. She was the donor in an earlier transplant operation
before Child B suffered the relapse.
Dr Gravett says the girl's chances of survival remained at 10%, but
added: ''I have no reason to think that the prospects are any more
gloomy than they have been over the past few days.''
The girl developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of five and was
sent to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where she received
chemotherapy.
By August 1992 she appeared to have made a full recovery but 15 months
later she was diagnosed as suffering from acute myeloid leukemia and was
transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital, west London, for her first
bone marrow transplant.
She left hospital last year and returned to school, but had a relapse
in mid-January and was given just six to eight weeks to live.

CONSERVATIVE Central Office yesterday named Hugh Colver, acting
director of communications at British Aerospace, as new Director of
Communications.
Mr Colver, 49, will play a pivotal role in the run-up to the next
General Election, handling the press and media and heading the party's
whole public relations regime.
He is already known to reporters at Westminster as he was a press
officer at 10 Downing Street from 1981-1982, and was chief of public
relations at the Ministry of Defence from 1987-1992 during the Gulf War.
He will replace Mr Tim Collins, 30, after the English local elections in
May.
Mr Collins, who has been in the post since after the last election in
1992, is to join the Prime Minister's policy unit at Number 10, covering
home affairs, defence, the constitution and the media.
Tory party chairman Jeremy Hanley said: ''I am delighted that Hugh
Colver is joining the Conservative team which will fight and win the
next general election. He has extensive experience of both public and
press relations.''
Mr Colver said: ''I always enjoyed the politics of Whitehall and
Westminster and relish this opportunity to return and contribute to the
continuation of Conservative government.''
When Mr Colver was chief of public relations at the Ministry of
Defence, he made an impassioned public plea for more balance in press
coverage of East-West relations after the then President Gorbachev's
visit to Britain.
He will play a key role in plotting election tactics, working closely
with Mr Hanley.
As the chief ''spin doctor'', his job will include briefing
journalists in a bid to encourage them to take a particular line on a
story.
His salary is reported to be about #60,000 a year, but Central Office
declined to confirm this.
Mr Colver will be taking over after what polls predict will be another
drubbing for the Tories in the local elections.

THE Transport Research Laboratory, which is responsible for many major
safety improvements on the road, is expected to be privatised this year,
the Government announced yesterday.
The 400-employee laboratory at Crowthorne, Berkshire, will be sold to
the private sector, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney. said. TRL has a
small satellite laboratory in Livingston, West Lothian, which is
included in the sale.
Dr Mawhinney said he was guaranteeing research work to TRL for a
number of years and there were a number of organisations interested in
acquiring the laboratory.
He added that the Government intended to ensure the purchaser ''has
the capacity to meet obligations and liabilities to staff transferring
to the new organisation''.

PRIME Minister's Questions without the Prime Minister is like Hamlet
without the Prince.
Yesterday's matinee audience had to put up with it as Mr Major is
traipsing round the Levant, ostensibly aiding the Palestinian peace
process and drumming up business for Britain, but more likely to have a
quiet word with Sir Richard Greenbury, one of the accompanying top
business persons on the plane, about what his now celebrated committee
is likely to recommend should be done about the pay of top people.
Mr Major is no Gielgud of the despatch box, and his understudy, Leader
of the House Tony Newton, is a competent performer, but it is inevitably
a let-down if you went along to see Sir John and you get Arnold Smith in
doublet and hose instead.
The Commons Hamlet allocates a lot more lines to Fortinbras played by
the Leader of the Opposition and, for 16 years, the curtain has never
fallen on the traditional Fortinbras takeover, although Mrs Thatcher,
the Sarah Bernhardt of her day, was eventually forced to rest from the
part.
Mr Blair looks like putting an end to Mr Major's run but, as stars
don't act with understudies at Westminster, he handed over his lines to
Mr John Prescott, his deputy, a quite plausible Claudius and positively
convincing First Gravedigger.
Alas, the critics would have to mark this down as a disappointing
performance. He hardly seemed the same man whose party conference Lear,
full of whirling words, virtually unintelligible but sensationally
powerful, had plunged hardened delegates into a state of ecstasy in
which they voted for one member-one vote.
The trouble is that Mr Prescott is an extemporiser. It is only when
set free from the restricting rules of English grammar that his genius
flourishes. Here, the faceless men who write soundbites had given him
Blair's notes and coached him until he was word- perfect.
He read them out clearly, intelligibly, unexcitingly. ''Is it not the
case that the Prime Minister's support for legislation against these
excesses is a sham?'' he mouthed.
Later, he performed Labour's equivalent to the ''Crispin's Day''
speech at Agincourt. ''What the people in Britain want is a fundamental
shift so that power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many
not the few,'' he orated.
The Tory players also had been mugging up the wording of the new
Clause Four. Mr Newton, recognising revamped socialism when he heard it,
dryly recommended a further rewrite.
We have all been to a theatrical performance where the production
resolutely refuses to take off. Labour banged on about overpaid
directors, Tories voiced annoyance at the easier terms on which
Ministers appear willing to talk to Sinn Fein and Mr Newton stonewalled
comfortably.
The curtain came down with no blood spilled and no bodies on the
floor; not the kind of thing the audience turn up for at all.

FORMER Prime Minister Baronesss Thatcher has recommended to MPs that
they should not interfere with the present system of the twice-weekly
Prime Minister's Question Time.
In a letter to the Commons Procedure Committee, which is holding an
inquiry into how Question Time is conducted, she makes clear her view
that there should be no change.
Lady Thatcher says she regards it as the Prime Minister's duty to meet
the wishes of the overwhelming majority of MPs, even although different
Question Time arrangements might suit the Prime Minister better.
She accepts that Members should not be constrained from asking a
particular question on a day when ''the issue of the hour is one on
which he is especially knowledgable,'' and she says that if the question
clearly falls within the responsibility of a particular Cabinet Minister
then it is all right for the Prime Minister to transfer the matter to
that Minister.
On the general principle, however, Lady Thatcher states: ''From the
viewpoint of the PM, one half-hour per week would be preferable to two
quarter-hour sessions because it would require only one briefing period.
But that may not suit the House. With two sessions a week, any emergency
can usually be referred to the PM for reply within two or three days.
''Unless any proposed alternative can be seen to be a considerable
advance on the present arrangements for PM's questions, my own
inclination would be to leave well alone. The present two sessions are
televised and admired in many other countries.''
The committee yesterday took oral evidence from one of Lady Thatcher's
former adversaries, the former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan, who
was critical of the system but took a broadly similar view.
Described by committee chairman Sir Peter Emery as a ''distinguished
witness,'' he openly admitted that he was at least a little nervous
before PMQs, and said that any Prime Minister who said he or she was not
nervous before the twice-weekly grilling was not telling the truth.
The 15-minute session on Tuesdays and Thursdays is meant to elicit
information from the Prime Minister of the day about what he is doing
and why, but Lord Callaghan thought that nowadays it was rather too much
to do with soundbites and cameras.
He acknowledged that PMQs were important because it illustrated the
way in which the Prime Minister conducted himself, but he admitted that,
like a swan, while he appeared calm on the surface he was ''paddling
like hell underneath.''
Like Lady Thatcher, the former Prime Minister took the line that while
it was reasonable for the Prime Minister of the day to answer for the
generality of Government policy, it was not reasonable for him to answer
for specifics. That was a matter for the Cabinet Ministers responsible
for each individual department.
Lord Callaghan was strongly against the present system where MPs ask a
general question and then can ask a supplementary about anything they
choose.
He told the committee: ''The Prime Minister must be accountable to the
House but specific questions should be put to him rather than that his
office should have to conduct a guessing game.''
Civil servants were involved in a lot of time and effort trying to
work out what a particular member was interested in and it would be far
better if members asked specific questions on specific subjects.
Lord Callaghan, Prime Minister from 1976-79, said: ''I rather feel
that the bludgeon has replaced the rapier, and on the whole the rapier
was a rather more elegant weapon and produced results which were just as
effective.''
However, he also told committee members: ''The system does work, and
if you cannot make any changes it will still be a good system. Ever
since I have been in the House there has always been dissatisfaction
with Question Time to the Prime Minister. It has been altered a number
of times so clearly we are not going to get an ideal solution.''

THE Government is to change the law following a case in which a man
stabbed his estranged wife to death after being led to her address by
information legitimately disclosed to him by the Children's Hearing
office in Stirling.
The Children's Hearings (Scotland) Rules 1986 are to be revised so
that Reporters to the Children's Panel are under no obligation to
disclose the address of vulnerable children, and, through them, the
address of their mothers, as part of the procedures prior to a
children's hearing.
The revision of the rules will coincide with new provisions in the
Children (Scotland) Bill affecting children's hearings which currently
are at their Commons committee stage.
The apparent loophole in existing law was highlighted at the High
Court in Edinburgh at the end of last month when a 34-year-old former
social worker from Aberdeen was jailed for life for the murder of his
33-year-old wife at the house with which she had been provided in
Stirling after she took refuge in a Women's Aid hostel.
Mr John Harris, Reporter to the Children's Panel in Central Region,
said that in this particular case he was under a legal obligation to
disclose the address of the woman and her children because he had been
given no reason to believe that the child was in danger from either
parent, and his remit was the protection of the children.
He, therefore, called for a strengthening of child protection laws to
allow Reporters to consider the safety of parents as well.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton told the Commons
committee considering the Children (Scotland) Bill yesterday:
''Following the Stirling tragedy, we will change the rules. Reporters
will no longer be under an obligation to disclose the address of
vulnerable children and through them the address of the mother.
''Indeed, the opposite will be the case, where there is an element of
physical danger.''
He added: ''We are now issuing guidance to Reporters advising them to
exercise extreme care in disclosing children's and parents' addresses
when they have reason to believe that disclosure of those addresses
could have serious consequences and could adversely affect the best
interests of the children.''
Mr Harris said yesterday: ''I welcome the recognition of the need to
advance the protection of children and parents in these extreme cases
where there is a serious likelihood of significant harm to the child.''
However, , the boyfriend of the murdered woman, said last night: ''I
am happy the rules have been changed now, but it has come too late, not
only for her -- it wasn't just her it happened to.''
Ms Lesley Irving, national worker for Scottish Women's Aid, said: ''We
very much welcome this news. At the time of this case, we wrote to Ian
Lang asking for guidance about this.
''Although it may seem an extreme case, with someone being murdered,
the next person who gets information about someone's whereabouts might
do the same thing. We are very happy that the Government has listened to
the advice from organisations such as ourselves.''
The Conservative MP for Stirling, Home Office Minister Michael
Forsyth, who took up the case, said: ''I obviously welcome the fact that
the Scottish Office has taken action to prevent a tragedy of this kind
recurring.''

GREVILLE JANNER, the Labour chairman of the all-party Commons
Employment Committee, still faces a battle to remain in his post as head
of the parliamentary inquiry into ''fat cat'' salaries.
Before the committee held a routine meeting yesterday, one of the six
Tory members -- unnamed -- was quoted by the BBC as saying that
''because of a conflict of interests and Greville's hectoring style'' he
should go.
Mr Janner, MP for Leicester West, and a director of training and
publishing company JSB Group, has come under increasing Tory pressure.
Last week, 16 Tories put their names to an emergency Commons motion
accusing him of having a conflict of interests.
As the committee -- still under Mr Janner's chairmanship -- started
its routine business, yesterday Tory Tim Yeo emerged to disclose that
the issue might not be resolved until next week.
''There was a brief discussion. The discussion was that it should be
considered again next week,'' he told reporters.
''Apparently it is not possible to put a motion (for Mr Janner to
stand down as chairman) before 24 hours' notice,'' Mr Yeo said.
Mr Janner only would say after the meeting: ''For procedural reasons
the matter has been postponed until next week and it would not be
appropriate for me in the circumstances to make any statement.''
He is believed to be furious at the moves to oust him and regards the
attempt as a political stunt which is bound to fail.
Friends of Mr Janner said he believes the whips will resist any such
move which could damage the whole Commons committee system.

A LABOUR MP last night demanded a Commons debate on the sacking of the
chief executive of the Student Loans Company.
The Glasgow-based company, which distributes loans to thousands of
students, announced Mr Ron Harrison's dismissal on Monday after an
investigation into alleged financial irregularities.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard said he was dismissed for
''conduct which has brought himself and the company into disrepute''.
However, it was made clear that no evidence of corruption had been
found.
The case was raised by Mr Mike Hall (Warrington South), a member of
Public Accounts Committee spending watchdog.
He said: ''Mr Harrison was sacked because of financial irregularities
in that company which have caused students great hardship.
''That is in direct contravention to evidence given to this House two
years ago to the Public Accounts Committee.''
The MP asked how the matter might be brought to the floor of the
House.
Mr Hall said later: ''There is an indication that the Public Accounts
Committee may have been misled.
''The House of Commons should be given the opportunity to look at this
again.''
He said his point of order had referred to an investigation by
Education Department officials of anonymous accusations passed to the
committee about the way the Student Loans Company was being run.
The officials had reported that there was no substance in the
allegations.
Mr Hall said there was now a case for the accusations to be revisited.

RESIGNED Tory Minister Robert Hughes gained the ''support'' of his
constituency party last night after making a surprise appearance at a
meeting where he pleaded his case to remain an MP.
Mr Hughes, who resigned as Citizen's Charter Minister eight days ago
after admitting an affair, had not been expected at the executive
committee meeting of Harrow West Conservatives.
However, the twice-married MP turned up and spoke to the crowded
meeting.
He left after about 45 minutes, saying only: ''We have had a friendly
meeting.''
Afterwards, constituency chairman Mrs Joyce Nickolay said: ''Mr Robert
Hughes, MP, spoke to the meeting, and, having heard him, the executive
committee expressed its continued support for him.''
Before the meeting, Mrs Nickolay had insisted that no decision over
whether Mr Hughes would be de-selected before the next election would be
taken last night.
The executive committee, which consists of two leading Conservatives
from each of Harrow West's 21 wards, would leave time for the dust to
settle, she said.
However, last night's pleas by Mr Hughes seemed to have been enough to
prompt the expression of support.
During the meeting, Mr Hughes could be seen on his feet addressing the
executive committee. Members put questions to the MP, who stood to
reply.
As he left the building, looking downcast, he refused to answer when
asked whether he would still be MP for Harrow West at the next election.

A COMMITTEE designed to exploit flaws in Labour's devolution proposals
has been set up by the Prime Minister. Mr Major is concerned that
apparent shifts in Labour's policy on constitutional change have not
been taken advantage of by Ministers.
The committee, chaired by Viscount Cranborne, the Government's Leader
in the Lords, will provide a ''rapid response'' to any Labour statement
on its plans for Home Rule in Scotland and Wales.
Although not a Scot, Viscount Cranborne is a staunch Unionist who, it
is understood, has pressed Mr Major for several months to take a more
aggressive stance against devolution.
The other members of the committee are: Ms Sophie McEwan, political
adviser to Lord Cranborne; Mr Gregor Mackay, adviser to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang; Mr Hywel Williams, adviser to Welsh Secretary John
Redwood; and Ms Rachel Whetstone, adviser to Home Secretary Michael
Howard.
Their Ministers will be put forward to respond in the media to Labour
policy as it unfolds.

<HEADLINE>Double defeat for Ministers in Lords over pension plans</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979386636</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government suffered a double defeat in the Lords last night over
its package reforming pensions law, as peers insisted on changes to
benefit divorcees and war widows.
Voting was 178 votes to 173, a majority of five, backing proposals
from Labour and the Liberal Democrats that payments to a spouse should
be deducted at source by a pension fund rather than leaving it to a
divorced pensioner to hand over the money.
Later, peers voted by 191 to 145, a majority of 46, for cross-party
demands that war widows, who currently lose their pensions on
remarriage, to have them restored if they are subsequently widowed for a
second time or divorced.
Social Security Minister of State Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish warned
this move could cost #40m a year and would be unfair to other widows.
The votes came during report stage debate on the Pensions Bill, which
equalises the state retirement age at 65 and puts in place safeguards
against a repeat of the Maxwell pensions problems.
Ministers now will have to consider the implications of the defeats,
which will have to be overturned by the Commons if they are not to
become law.
The votes brought to three the number of Government defeats on the
Bill in the Lords. Last month, peers backed, by 105 to 61, a Labour move
to increase the Serps element of state pensions.
Last night's successful amendment on war widows was introduced by
crossbencher Lord Freyberg, the 24-year-old grandson of a First World
War holder of the Victoria Cross, following the narrow defeat last month
of his call for war widows to retain their #140-a-week tax-free pension
for life.
Baroness Seear, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ''This is an
important victory for women to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. The
least we can do is restore pension rights to war widows who have
suffered a second bereavement.''
Earlier, Lord MacKay declared his support for an amendment from Tory
former Lords leader Baroness Young clarifying Ministers' recent
commitment to require courts to ''take into account'' pension rights in
divorce settlements in England and Wales.
However, peers backed the Opposition parties' demand for payments to a
spouse to be deducted at source by a pension fund, despite the
Minister's warning that their amendment would cause administrative
burdens to pension funds.
Baroness Hollis of Heigham, for the Opposition,insisted that to
require pensioners to make the payment to ex-partners would create the
sort of problems that had beset the Child Support Agency.
She said after the vote: ''This Bill will now significantly improve
the financial position of some women facing divorce.''
Later, in debate on the amendment on war widows' pensions, Lord
Freyberg said the change sought to ''alleviate the severe need of war
widows''.
He insisted: ''A war widow who remarries and loses a second husband
should be granted automatic restoration of the Department Social
Security element of her pension.''
Lord Freyburg said the present rules put ''cruel pressure'' on war
widows, who had to choose between remarriage and a lifelong pension.
''The Government condemns war widows to a life of solitude,'' he
protested.
Lord Freyberg's amendment was supported by more than 30 Tories,
including former Ministers Lord Boyd-Carpenter, Lord Braine of Wheatley,
Lord Glenarthur and Lord Peyton of Yeovil.
Lord Mackay later blamed the defeat on the ''well-whipped Lords on the
crossbenches''.
He said 90,000 war widows had remarried since 1939 and half of them
were probably still living. He added that the decline in numbers was
partly offset by recent deaths of ex-Servicemen as a result of war
injuries.
Lord Mackay argued that the war widow's pension was never meant as
compensation for the loss of a husband -- ''no pension could possibly do
that'' -- but as a financial support.

FEW Scots will travel to London to take part in the national three-day
party from May 6 to 8 to commemorate VE-Day, it was made clear
yesterday.
Billed as the largest free show held in the UK, the organisers aim to
recreate the atmosphere which marked the end of the Second World War in
Europe 50 years ago. Millions will take part.
Former enemies, represented by German Chancellor Helmut Khol, will
join in the event to reflect the themes of thanksgiving, peace and
reconciliation in a celebration centred on 40 acres of London's Hyde
Park.
A highlight will be the recreation of the jubilant crowd scenes
outside Buckingham Palace when the royal family and Sir Winston
Churchill appeared on the balcony. Bands, acting as pied pipers, will
lead the hordes from Hyde Park to outside the palace.
However, it appeared the Scottish representation would be
comparatively thin on the ground.
Details of the event were announced by Viscount Cranborne, Leader of
the House of Lords, and Major Michael Parker, famed for producing the
Edinburgh Tattoo, who is stage-managing the whole affair.
''Certainly Scotland will be well represented,'' Major Parker
declared. ''There will be loads of young people coming from Strathclyde
to put on a show linked to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. I got a
letter from them only yesterday. Then there will be pipe bands.''
However, that seemed to be the sum of Scottish involvement so far.
''But bids are coming in every day,'' Major Parker added.
It will be an orgy of reminiscence, forgiveness, singing, music,
dancing, flypasts, fireworks, and general jollification. More than 50
heads of state have been invited.
Vera Lynn, Tony Bennett, Cliff Richard, and the Tiller Girls will be
joined by pipes and drums from Canada, dancers, orchestras and choirs
from various corners of the world, and pearly kings and queens. They
will perform on the largest stage ever constructed in the UK.
Denied their own national event, other than a service of thanksgiving
at St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, attended by the Princess Royal, in
order not to take any of the gloss away from the national celebrations,
the Scots are now concentrating on organising the biggest presence they
can muster in London for the August parade of Veterans to mark VJ-Day
and the end of the war world-wide.
At the moment that would also seem to be at the most 380, the largest
number that can be carried on a British Airways aircraft which will
leave Edinburgh for Gatwick on August 19 and return the same evening.
''That will include standard bearers from the Royal British Legion,
Scotland, and I hope a pipe band,'' said General Sir Michael Gow, the
Scottish representative on the committee organising the VE-Day/VJ-Day
commemorations.
The fact that they have to catch the plane back the same day should
ensure the Scottish contingent should be at the front of the parade
along The Mall, he said.
He was also determined that no matter where they came from, whether it
be Thurso or Glasgow, no veteran taking part in that event would have to
pay a penny.
Although the decision has been taken at the highest level that there
should be no major national commemoration in Scotland on the anniversary
of VE-Day, there are plans for scores of local events. Details will be
announced next week.

A REVIEW of Railtrack's structure has cast even greater doubt on a
modernisation of the west coast main line, according to Shadow Transport
Minister Henry McLeish.
A internal document leaked to the MP last night shows that Railtrack
is set to reduce its 10 regions to eight from June 26.
The document recommends that the west coast main line south of Crewe
should become part of the Midlands' region, while the track north of
Crewe should go into the North West zone.
Mr McLeish said such a split will make co-ordination even more
difficult for a modernisation ''already in trouble'' -- with no funding
or timetable in place for a project second in scale only to the Channel
Tunnel rail link.
The document, from Railtrack's chief executive, Mr John Edmonds, to
all staff, says that the new eight-zone structure is aimed at making the
organisation as efficient as possible and at improving customer focus.
Last week, Railtrack dismissed claims by the white-collar rail union
TSSA of a reduction in zones as speculation. The union believes the
changes are a desperate attempt ''to make an unworkable system work''.
Meanwhile, an all-party delegation yesterday met the rail regulator,
Mr Jonathon Swift, to discuss the future of Motorail and the Fort
William sleeper services.
Mr McLeish, accompanied by Shadow industry spokesman Brian Wilson,
Liberal Democrat Russell Johnston and Tory Allan Stewart, said later:
''Mr Swift can be in no doubt as to the anger of passengers and local
people about the proposed closure of services.''
He said the services must continue after May 28 if an ongoing
consultation period is to prove meaningful. The report on consultations
is not due to be published until the autumn.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities will today lobby the
Transport Select Committee about the threats to sleepers and Motorail.

A MAN, accused of murdering his former employer by shooting him, had
claimed he could commit the perfect crime with a gun, it was alleged
yesterday.
Mr Kevin Potter, 28, of RAF Leuchers, Fife, told the High Court in
Edinburgh he was friendly with the accused, Mr George Tolmie, because of
a shared interest in firearms. He said Mr Tolmie was a good shot and a
member of Tayforth Shooting Club.
Mr Potter, the son-in-law of the dead man, former Dundee publican
Danny Hallet, met Mr Tolmie at Constable's pub, Dundee, where Mr Tolmie
was a commercial manager.
Mr Tolmie, 39, denies murdering Mr Hallett at Pathcondie Farm, Letham,
Fife, last November.
Mr Potter told the court on one visit to Mr Tolmie's home in 1992 a
video was playing about the death of President Kennedy. Mr Tolmie, he
claimed, began discussing the J F K conspiracy and said how easy it
would be for him (Tolmie) ''to murder someone and get away with it''.
He said he would fire the weapon at someone, take out the working
parts of the gun, replace them with parts from a different weapon of
equal calibre, and rebore the weapon making the bullets found in the
body untraceable to the weapon.
Mr Potter said he got the impression that Mr Tolmie was speaking about
his ex-wife. Mr Tolmie had said she was ''screwing him for money''.
The court heard that Mr Tolmie's legally held weapons included a 9mm
automatic pistol, a .45 calibre pistol, a .22 Rimfire rifle, .303 Lee
Enfield, and a 12-bore, four-shot, automatic shotgun.
Earlier, Detective Inspector Hamish Tait, a former head of Tayside
drugs squad, told the court he had known Mr Hallett since the 1970s but
did not believe he was involved in drugs.
Mr Tait said: ''I have reasonable knowledge of the drugs fraternity
and he never came to my attention in that connection.'' He was not aware
Mr Hallett was in debt to the tune of about #100,000.
The trial continues.

THE incoming director of ScotRail, Mr John Ellis, admitted yesterday
the Government's privatisation programme was far from ideal.
That extraordinary confession -- made well before even taking over as
head of one of Scotland's largest businesses -- is one of the most
embarrassing yet for a Government striving to win over a sceptical
public.
Mr Ellis did try to instil confidence in the network's future on
privatisation by announcing he would lead a management-employee bid for
the franchise to run trains in Scotland. He said ScotRail did not intend
to lose the franchise by default and would lodge pre-qualification
documents by Friday's deadline.
Mr Ellis added he was voting with his feet, and in due course with his
wallet, by returning to Scotland to lead the bid. However, he still left
an abundance of question marks after travelling from London to brief
Scotland's media on his appointment from April 3.
Mr Ellis, production director of Railtrack before taking over at
ScotRail, came, saw, and fudged. It was a remarkable performance,
including a thinly-veiled attack on his popular predecessor, Mr Chris
Green, who resigned last month because of frustration that the Scottish
network would be damaged by privatisation.
Above all, Mr Ellis failed to fully address Mr Green's despairing
insistence that services could not be maintained at anything near
present levels unless Government financial support for the railways was
increased. He was also unable to:
* Rule out jobs losses, fare increases, or fewer services when
Government budget cuts of at least 5% are imposed from April.
* Say how the current level of services funded by Strathclyde
Passenger Transport Executive could be achieved after local government
organisation, which he admitted could delay privatisation.
* Offer hope of reprieves for threatened Scottish sleeper and Motorail
services after the consultation period.
* Guarantee the security, let alone expansion, of rural services. They
would be subject to funding from the franchise director and ScotRail
would expand such services on commercial rather than social grounds.
Last night, the rail union RMT warned Mr Ellis was ''living in cloud
cuckoo land'' if he thought its members had any interest in buying
shares in ''a totally unworkable and discredited process''.
Scottish divisional organiser Phil McGarry added: ''Even BR chairman
Sir Bob Reid has said he would not invest in the railways.''
In an exclusive interview last month, Mr Green told The Herald
impending budget cuts could result in a loss of 600 jobs, higher fares,
and fewer trains. He resigned soon afterwards, after being ''gagged'' by
the British Rail board for also insisting ScotRail would be run down if
more Government subsidy was not forthcoming.
In contrast, comments made by Mr Ellis yesterday suggested he would
pay lip service to a Government philosophy that implied services could
improve even when funds were slashed.
Although acknowledging that the industry's restructuring was ''not
ideal'', Mr Ellis emphasised ScotRail would work within the
privatisation framework laid down by the Government. It was unlikely his
franchise tender would seek to bring back railway infrastructure under
the control of ScotRail.
When asked how he would cope with subsidy cuts when half ScotRail's
#300m income already comes from grant aid, he replied: ''I do not know
yet. It is not the first time we have had a tough budget to deliver.''
Mr Ellis argued there were options to reduce costs without job cuts,
fare increases, or reduced services. He intended to increase income by
attracting more passengers. Other priorities included rebuilding staff
morale and improving train punctuality and reliability.
Asked if he agreed with last week's statement by outgoing BR chairman
Sir Bob Reid that he would have gone about switching rail to the private
sector differently, Mr Ellis admitted: ''I would not myself believe that
this is the ideal way of restructuring the railway industry.''
However, he was a pragmatist. He believed ScotRail as professionals
would manage within the framework as provided, and added: ''We will make
any structure work.''
Mr Ellis said he believed the current level of services would still be
in force in seven years. He saw no justification for concerns about
rural services because the franchise director's revenue commitments
would be on a long-term rather than annual basis.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish said last night: ''Despite the
coded language, it is quite clear the new director has serious concerns
about what most people regard as the monumental folly of rail
privatisation.''
Mr McLeish called on Mr Ellis not to become a mouthpiece for the
Government. He must make a stand against the excesses of privatisation
to protect passengers, the economy, and the very fabric of Scottish
society.
Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye,
said: ''If privatisation is to be forced upon the industry, then many of
us have thought for some time that a Scottish management buy-out bid
would be the least bad option. John Ellis brings a tough reputation with
him to his new post. We are going to need a robust character for the
period that now lies ahead.''

THE Victoria Cross awarded to an officer of the Royal Scots Greys is
expected to sell for at least #90,000 when it comes up for auction later
this month.
It was awarded posthumously to Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Keyes who
led the 11th Scottish Commando detachment 250 miles behind enemy lines
in Libya in a bid to blow up Rommel's German HQ -- and capture him.
Lt Col Keyes and his unit were put ashore by submarine behind enemy
lines and spent four days and nights evading German units as they crept
under cover of darkness towards their target.
At midnight on the evening of the attack, he and two other officers
boldly went up to Rommel's residence, knocked on the door and, speaking
in German, demanded entrance.
A suspicious sentry whom they failed to overpower, was shot and the
commotion which followed roused the remaining Germans who had been
sleeping.
The raiding party, no longer able to use stealth, began to burst into
each of the rooms, firing revolvers and throwing grenades to keep
resistance to a minimum.
But as Lt Col Keyes showed himself silhouetted by the hall lights
against the darkened doorway of one of the rooms, he was shot dead as he
flung the door open.
The party had set explosive charges around the Germans' North Africa
operational HQ but heavy rain had dampened the fuses and they failed to
explode.
Before the surviving members of the British team retreated, they threw
grenades through windows and left timebombs behind which caused total
havoc and major damage to the property.
Press reports described the episode as one of the most hazardous
undercover objectives of 1941 and Lt Col Keyes was praised for his
heroic actions.
Specialist London auctioneers Spink &amp; Son say the famous ''Rommel
Raid'' Victoria Cross will attract interest from around the world when
it comes up for sale on March 28.
Spokesman Richard Bishop said: ''Not only is it the only Scottish
Commando VC, but it is the only Commando VC of any type to be offered at
auction and is attracting enormous interest from both collectors and
museums.''

ASIAN women are unwilling to look for treatment for depression because
of the stigma surrounding the illness in their community in Scotland.
Isolation, loneliness, and language difficulties are three of the main
causes of their depression, a seminar on the subject in Edinburgh City
Chambers yesterday revealed.
The organiser, the Asian Women's Centre of Edinburgh, said it hoped
the meeting would help break down the barriers in its community about
depression.
The centre co-ordinator, Ms Nain Bala Minhas, said: ''We want to
dispel myths and increase understanding of depression as a health issue
among Asian women. The people must have the confidence to talk to their
GP if they feel depressed.
''Unfortunately depression is an illness which is looked on as not a
very good thing in our community. Many women are unwilling to seek help
for the problem and feel there is a stigma surrounding them if they do.
''Many Asian women were concerned that if they do go for treatment
there is not enough help for them in the places they go to.
''We are telling them that that is changing and hospitals are doing
their best to help them. For instance, the Royal Edinburgh Hospital
appointed a black worker a few months back to help women when they come
into the hospital.''

TICKET sales have been so disappointing since Stephen Fry quit his

The last performance of Cell Mates, starring Rik Mayall and Fry's

The show was to have been staged until the end of May but it never
recovered from Fry's dramatic flight to Belgium, after unfavourable
reviews, just three days into the run.
It emerged he had fled because he felt he had failed as an actor.
The actor supplied the producer with a doctor's certificate which said
he had clinical depression and recommended a month off work.
''The houses started off being excellent but all the publicity went
against them,'' a spokeswoman for Duncan C. Weldon Productions said.
The play, about KGB spy George Blake's escape from Wormwood Scrubs,

YARROW Shipbuilders, the last British-owned yard on the Clyde, is on
the short leet for a #200m order which could help preserve more than
3000 jobs over the next two years.
The Clydeside yard, owned by GEC, and Spanish shipbuilder Bazan are
the final contenders for a deal to build four large corvettes for the
South African navy with an option for four more after 2005.
South Africa's Parliament is due to debate defence spending tomorrow
and a decision is expected on the warship deal within the next few
weeks. Danish, German, and French yards which tendered for the contract
have already been eliminated from the bidding.
It is understood that any award of the order to the UK might be linked
to a British aid package, and possibly to the re-establishment of Royal
Navy use of the giant Simonstown naval base near Durban.
Mr Murray Easton, Yarrow's managing director, said yesterday: ''We
have still to cross a number of hurdles. Not the least of our problems
is Bazan, a nationalised, subsidised firm with a good track record. It
is currently building a helicopter assault ship for Thailand.
''We also need the next three-ship batch order of Type 23 frigates for
the Royal Navy. Bids were supposed to be lodged this month, but it has
now been delayed until June.
''The two orders, in combination, would preserve most of the 3100 jobs
at the yard over the next two years. But it would take both to give us
that level of stability.
''Vosper-Thorneycroft and VSEL are also bidding for the frigate order.
VSEL is cash-rich, and can afford to trim its bid accordingly. Vospers
are also running out of immediate work, and will be keen to try for a
foothold in the home market.''
Yarrow managment has been trawling world markets in recent years for
alternative sources of work after the collapse of a regular, guaranteed
batch order for the Royal Navy during the 1980s because of shrinking
defence budgets.
A prospective bid to supply Pakistan with a modern frigate force
foundered when Whitehall refused to put up export credits. Now the yard
is understood to be among 13 builders in the running for warships for
Kuwait and other Gulf nations, fuelled by the threat of Iran's purchase
of three former Soviet Kilo-class submarines last year.
Meanwhile, John Brown Engineering, the Clydebank-based heavy
engineering firm, yesterday announced 280 job losses as a result of
falling demand at home and abroad for gas turbines and power stations.
Consultations with white-collar and manual unions have already begun.
A company spokesman said the firm had called for volunteers, but that
compulsory redundancies would be enforced if necessary.
Clydebank Labour MP Tony Worthington last night called on the
Government to give JBE every assistance to win orders in the Far East
and Middle East.
''It is crucial that this manufacturing technology is kept in
Britain,'' he said. ''This company has proved over and over again that
it can win orders against world competition. The Department of Trade and
Industry must act now to ensure that the 1250 jobs that remain on
Clydeside are safeguarded.''
Mr Andy Matson, regional organiser of the white-collar union MSF,
added: ''John Brown Engineering is owned by Trafalgar House, which is
trying to buy Northern Electric. That means money is available.
''We will be fighting to preserve as many jobs as possible, and to
keep skills vital for the future of the company in Clydebank.''

ONE of Scotland's biggest further education colleges has announced
severe cost-cutting measures.
They come in the wake of Government policies aimed at encouraging
competition and greater efficiency.
As the strategy begins to bite, the board of management which runs
Falkirk College of Technology has concluded that savings of #670,000
must be made during the next year to guarantee the institution's
financial viability.
Principal Dr Graham Clark said yesterday that the cost-cutting package
was equivalent to about 35 redundancies across all areas.
He said he could not rule out compulsory redundancies, but hoped job
losses could be achieved by voluntary means.
However, Mr Jim McKinlay, college secretary of the main further
education teachers' union, the College Lecturers' Association, said
staff were depressed and dismayed by the management's strategy.
He said: ''We have had three rounds of voluntary retirements in the
last two years but management have come back again.
''Further staff reductions can only affect the quality of teaching we
offer.''
There were warnings last night that as many as 10 other colleges would
have to take tough cost-cutting decisions largely because of the
Government's policies for funding the sector.
Dr Clark blamed a cut in grant-in-aid in the present financial year, a
growing performance-related element in funding, falling numbers of
part-time students, and a cap on higher education student numbers for
the college's difficulties.
Other colleges which are experiencing tougher times as a result of
funding cuts and increased competition include Stevenson College in
Edinburgh, West Lothian College, Jewel and Esk College in the Borders,
and Dundee College.
In the face of the new funding formula and further cuts in the
Scottish Office grant-in-aid scheme -- which accounts for about 70% of
college funding -- Falkirk College has opted for a ''kill or cure,''
one-off solution which, it hopes, will avoid staff being demoralised in
the longer term.
Mr John Sellars, chief executive of the body which represents college
managements, the Employers' Association, said: ''Falkirk College is
taking its situation seriously. It is in my view one of nine or 10
colleges which will be reviewing resources and matching them with
development plans. Inevitably, because staffing is the most expensive
costs, colleges will have to have a careful look at their levels.''

A MOTHER who killed her first baby was jailed for life yesterday for
murdering the two-year-old daughter whom social services had left in her
care.
As a jury found Tracey Lister, 24, guilty of murdering Sarah Varley,
social workers, who were satisfied that she had changed from a killer to
a caring parent, sat in court.
Police discovered Sarah's battered body clothed and surrounded by her
favourite toys in a ''shrine'' on her mother's double bed. A crucifix
lay beside her, the jury at Leeds Crown Court was told.
Five years earlier, Lister was convicted of the manslaughter of her
18-day-old son Daniel. He died of brain damage in 1988 after
''substantial'' blows to the head. For that offence she was placed on
probation for three years.
Social service chiefs said they did everything possible to protect
Sarah, who was made a ward of court immediately after she was born.
Mr Liam Hughes, Bradford Council's director of social services, said
it was only right that a review be held ''to see what can be learned''.
Defending the decision to allow Sarah into her mother's care, he said:
''An independent inquiry has already been held in line with Government
guidelines and found there were no errors in the process.
''It appeared that Sarah was getting a good standard of care from her
mother and staff devoted considerable time and effort to ensure her
welfare.''
The jury heard that Sarah's two-stone frame was covered with old and
fresh bruises from head to toe.
The decision to allow her into Lister's care at her home in Bradford,
West Yorkshire, ultimately rested with the High Court.
The child was allowed to live with her after a unanimous
recommendation to the court from social workers, police, probation
officers and health service experts, including pyschiatrists.
Lister told the court she was bathing Sarah when the child
accidentally touched her breasts, bringing back painful memories of the
childhood abuse she had suffered.
Then she attacked Sarah ''like a mad woman'', slapping and kicking
her. She left the room to calm down and returned to find her dead in the
water.
She dried and clothed Sarah for bed, even combing her hair. She then
played her favourite Humpty Dumpty tape in the hope of reviving her.
Detective Chief Inspector David Jeffrey, who led the investigation,
described Lister as ''cool and calculated''.
''She was interviewed by eight different pyschiatriats, who gave
differing opinions. She's quite capable of misleading the most
professional members of that field,'' he said.
A copy of the inquiry into the tragedy has been sent to the Department
of Health Social Services Inspectorate.

THE international rock star formerly known as Prince surprised his
Glasgow fans last night with an impromptu club performance in the city
centre.
Hundreds of people queued outside the Garage Night Club in Sauchiehall
Street in the hope of getting a ticket. The singer had decided to top
off a two-night concert date, in front of a nightly audience of 9000,
with a club gig for some of his more devoted fans.
Management at the night club were told of his final decision to
go-ahead only hours before he was due to take the stage.
Tickets went on sale after 11pm at #15 a head.
Mr Tam Coyle of Music Industries Glasgow, who were promoting the
performance, said the club could hold 600 people and tickets would be
sold on a first come, first served basis.
Many fans went to The Garage straight after the concert at the SECC
ended in a bid to get in.
One of them, 20-year-old community artist Tina Cairns who queued for
four hours, said she thought the performance was a bargain.
''Fifteen pounds is less than you would pay at the SECC, a lot of
people can't afford that, and this will be more intimate.''

THE arrest of Premier League trio John Fashanu, Bruce Grobbelaar and
Hans Segers by police investigating allegations of match-fixing left the
national game covered by a fresh coating of sleaze.
Merson, Graham, Cantona, Ince, Wise, Armstrong, Jones, Kinnear,
Segers, Grobbelaar, Fashanu . . . everyone is wondering who will be
next.
Football has not known a season like it with drug-taking, transfer
''bungs'', kung-fu kicks and court hearings. Many protest their
innocence, but they have all made the headlines for the wrong reasons.
Even the thugs had their moment, forcing the abandonment of England's
friendly international in Dublin.
The national game has been rocked to its grass roots after a catalogue
of trouble that started four months ago with Grobbelaar.
That was the most serious charge against the integrity of football
since the mid-60s jail sentences and life bans for match-rigging against
England stars Peter Swan and Tony Kay and Sheffield Wednesday striker
David Layne.
* November: Bruce Grobbelaar at centre of match-fixing allegations.
The FA charge the Southampton goalkeeper with misconduct after The Sun
newspaper hands over a dossier of videos, interviews and photographs to
Lancaster Gate. Grobbelaar protests his innocence and FA puts inquiry on
hold until police complete their investigations.
* November: Arsenal striker Paul Merson admits to cocaine, alcohol and
drug addiction, and is ordered to spend six weeks in a rehabilitation
clinic by the FA.
* January: Eric Cantona is involved in an incident with a Crystal
Palace fan following his dismissal during Manchester United's 1-1 draw
at Selhurst Park. He is suspended by United until the end of the season
and fined two weeks' wages (#20,000). The Frenchman is later banned
until September 30, 1995 inclusive and fined #10,000 by the FA, and
charged with common assault by the police.
* February: Fan runs on to Ewood Park pitch and attempts to attack
referee Rodger Gifford after Blackburn's home game against Leeds.
* February: Mounted police throw a cordon across the Stamford Bridge
pitch following an invasion by Chelsea fans after the FA Cup penalty
shoot-out defeat by First Division Millwall.
* February: Cantona, holidaying in the Caribbean to escape media
attention, is accused of attacking ITN reporter Terry Lloyd.
* February: Rioting fans force the abandonment of England's friendly
against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.
* February: Vinnie Jones is dropped by Wimbledon for three games after
biting a reporter's nose in a Dublin hotel bar. Jones and boss Joe
Kinnear are charged with misconduct following after-match incidents at
Newcastle.
* February: Arsenal sack manager George Graham after Premier League
inquiry alleges he received #425,000 following transfers of John Jensen
and Pal Lyderson to Highbury. FA charge Graham with misconduct on March
7.
* February: Belgian police deport more than 800 people following
violent scenes before and after Chelsea's European Cup Winners' Cup
quarter-finals first leg in Bruges.
* March: #5m-rated striker Chris Armstrong left out of Crystal Palace
side for four games on FA instructions after testing positive for
cannabis.
* March: Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince is charged with common
assault by police for attacking a Crystal Palace fan on January 25. Both
he and Cantona are due to appear in court on March 23.
* March: Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear charged by FA with misconduct
for second time this year after being ''sent-off'' at home defeat by
Manchester United.
* March: Chelsea skipper Dennis Wise released on bail pending his
appeal against a three-month prison sentence for an assault on a taxi
driver. He had withdrawn from the England squad to face the Republic of
Ireland after being found guilty of the offence at a hearing in
February.
* March: Goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers and striker John
Fashanu are arrested in connection with match-rigging allegations
alongside a Malaysian businessman and Fashanu's girlfriend.

MALAYSIAN betting syndicates are claimed to have bribed players to fix
English football games this season after a domestic corruption crackdown
forced them to look overseas for new money-making opportunities.
Match fixing in south-east Asia is a cottage industry worth an
estimated #300m a year. It has turned the national leagues in Malaysia,
Thailand and Indonesia into joke tournaments.
All 144 players in the Malaysian league are under suspicion of taking
bribes. Crooked bookmakers are often linked to local crime gangs and, in
some cases, drug barons and triads.
In Singapore, Czech player Michael Vana was convicted in his absence
last year of accepting #230,000 in bribes to throw five matches. A
referee was jailed for eight months.
Gambling on football is illegal in most south-east Asian countries,
but syndicates are run by shadowy Mr Bigs, usually Chinese, who employ
thousands and make millions.
Betting on English football has risen 10-fold in the past five years
in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, according to Malaysian
analysts.
Sports journalist Johnson Fernandez, of the Malay Mail, says he has
seen a ''secret list'' of six British players whom he alleges have taken
bribes.
Former British referee Ken Aston, one of the most respected figures in
world soccer, was the latest target for the syndicates. Police are
investigating how he was promised #25,000 to pass on addresses and
telephone numbers of leading players and referees.
Mr Aston was approached in a Singapore restaurant while on holiday but
immediately reported the incident to the Football Association.
The syndicate was prepared to gamble up to #450,000 to win around
#2.7m.
Mr Aston said: ''These people want a correct score and to do that they
have got to bribe players and the ref.''

THREE football stars, more used to luxury homes and glamorous social
lives, settled down last night to the privations of a prison cell.
Goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers, and centre forward John
Fashanu, were being kept in police custody overnight after being
arrested by officers investigating allegations of match-rigging.
Until the Sun last November alleged game-fixing, the only charge those
involved in football would have laid against BRUCE GROBBELAAR was that
he was arguably the greatest eccentric in the modern game.
It was not only his obvious recklessness in leaving his line to go for
balls that were never his, it was his whole attitude and approach to the
art of goalkeeping that endeared him to millions throughout the world.
It is said you had to be mad to be a goalkeeper. There is madness and
then there is Bruce Grobbelaar.
However, his 13-year record with Liverpool proves he was a world-class
player.
He has to his credit medals for six English league championships,
three FA cup finals, and the 1984 European championship.
He is, and always has been, irrepressible. While lesser persons might
have been devastated by match-fixing allegations in a national newspaper
and could not have been blamed for fleeing the country to escape the
limelight, Grobbelaar left Britain only to play in an international
match for Zimbabwe under the glare of publicity.
He protested his innocence to the scores of journalists who chased
after him from London. He still does.
Grobbelaar's career has been extraordinary. Born in Rhodesia on
October 6, 1957 his formative years were obviously linked with his
country's battles with Britain over his country's unilateral declaration
of independence and the sanctions that followed.
He fought in the Rhodesian army in the civil war which eventually
brought about the new country of Zimbabwe, a nation he was later proud
to represent on the football field.
''I know how lucky I am,'' he once said recalling nightmares in which
he heard screams and saw terrified faces. ''If war teaches you anything
it is an appreciation of being alive.''
Grobbelaar first turned up in the UK at Crewe in 1979 on a free
transfer from the Vancouver Whitecaps. He played 24 games and then went
back to Canada. Liverpool brought him back to this country in 1981 for a
#250,000 fee where he took over from Ray Clemence.
He became an early hero helping the team to win the championship and
the League Cup.
He reached the heights in 1984 when Liverpool became the first team to
win the English hat-trick of titles since Arsenal in 1935. His so-called
''spaghetti legs'' antics in front of goal in the penalty shoot-out in
the European Cup final also helped bring that trophy back to Liverpool.
From then on he was a mainstay in the Liverpool team, winning his last
honour with the club in 1992 when the reds beat Sunderland 2-0 in the FA
cup final. Two years later he joined Southampton on a free transfer.
There his eccentricities continued.
He might reasonably have expected, however, that from then on his
career would begin to fade outwith the glare of publicity.
That might have been the case, but for the developments that brought a
horde of cameras and journalists to the door of his rented house
yesterday, just as detectives moved in to make an arrest.
HANS SEGERS had to be something special as a goalkeeper to win over
the Wimbledon fans.
He took over from Dave Beasant, who saved a penalty in the 1988 FA Cup
to give this somewhat unfashionable club the trophy. It was Wimbledon's
greatest moment.
However, not only has the Dutchman kept his team in the Premiership,
he has proved himself to be every bit the crowd-pleaser as his
predecessor.
He even learned some of his trade in Scotland: in 1988 he played four
games for Dunfermline while on loan.
On the field, Segers appears more of a journeyman goalkeeper, not the
type to make the same madcap dashes from the line as Bruce Grobbelaar.
In private, however, Segers is just as much an extrovert as
Grobbelaar. He was one of the self-styled Wimbledon Crazy Gang. Past and
present members of the club have always prided themselves that they know
how to play hard -- on and off the pitch.
When there had been rumours the Sun was to expose a goalkeeper for
allegedly taking bribes last November, Segers started receiving phone
calls.
He said at the time: ''People were asking if it was me. I couldn't
believe it. I thought it was a joke. They had put two and two together
and come up with five. I had a good laugh about it.
''As for the Everton game, no-one had really mentioned those three
goals (one a penalty and one a top-corner screamer from Barry Horne)
until now. But the suggestion is not only amazing, but stupid.''
Last May, Everton had been losing 2-0 when they needed a win to remain
in the Premiership, triumphed 3-2.
Born in Eindhoven on October 30, 1961 Segers has always resented the
fact that while contemparies in the under-18 Dutch national team Ronald
Koeman and Ruud Gullit made it to full international honours, he did
not.
He signed for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest for only #50,000 in
1984 and played 58 league games. Before joining Wimbledon in 1988 he was
out on loan to various teams including Dunfermline, Stoke, and Sheffield
United.
Segers lives with his hairdresser wife Astrid and their three children
in the Hampshire town of Fleet, where he was arrested yesterday.
The 33-year-old owns a successful tie manufacturing company.
In the time he has been playing with Wimbledon, he has missed only
five games.
Until yesterday JOHN FASHANU, ''Fash the Bash'', might have considered
himself one of the luckiest players in football.
After a clash with Tottenham Hotspur defender Gary Mabbutt, the Spurs
captain was out of the game for months and required his face to be
rebuilt.
Many who saw the incident believed that Fashanu should have had no
further place in football.
Mabbutt still carries the scars.
The crowd saw it all, as did the television cameras. The referee did
not and Fashanu has been allowed to continue to play top level football.
In White Hart Lane last night, there were no tears over his arrest.
His brother Justin chose to come out the closet and declare his
homosexuality while playing football in Scotland.
However, according to newspaper reports, he had a relationship with
Julie Goodyear, who plays Bet Lynch in Coronation Street.
John's link with television has been more high-profile.
He is co-presenter of the popular Gladiators ITV programme on Saturday
evening.
Barnardo's boys born in London, the Fashanu brothers were fostered to
a couple in Norfolk. It was obvious that they were both talented in
sport, and in particular football.
In 1979, aged 16, John signed professionally for Norwich. He played
for Lincoln and Millwall before joining Wimbledon in 1985 for #125,000.
Within 15 minutes of his first game for that team, Portsmouth's Kevin
Dillon left the field with a broken jaw, after a clash.
In 1987 he was involved in a tackle which led to the early retirement
of Northern Ireland international John O'Neill.
In 1988 he was banned for three matches and fined #2000 for his part
in an incident in the tunnel involving Manchester United's Viv Anderson.
In the same year he helped Wimbledon win the FA Cup with a shock 1-0
victory over Liverpool.
He had a training ground clash in 1993 with Wimbledon team-mate Lawrie
Sanchez, who claimed: ''Fashanu used martial arts in a systematic
attempt to damage my legs seriously.''
His second and last international cap was against Scotland at Hampden
in 1989.
He was transferred to Aston Villa in 1994 for #1.35m.

A MURDER charge against a mother and daughter was found not proven
yesterday while the man alleged to have carried out the crime for them
was found guilty and jailed for life.
A jury decided by a majority that Thomas Whiteside, 30, strangled Mr
Robert Greig before smashing his head with a hammer.
The nine women and six men on the jury unanimously found the murder
charge against Mrs Frances Greig, 43, of Shortroods Road, Paisley, and
her daughter Laura, 20, not proven. All three had denied at the High
Court in Glasgow that they plotted the murder.
The Crown claimed that Mrs Greig had ruined the lives of three men in
a bid to rid herself of her husband.
The court heard that she was allegedly responsible for her husband's
murder, for the fate of Whiteside, who was the fiance of another
daughter, Denise, and for destroying her lover's marriage.
Mr David Kerr, 50, a bus supervisor of East Kilbride, told the court
he had sex with Mrs Greig in Laura's house in Love Street, Paisley, on
the night of the murder.
Whiteside told the court he killed Mr Greig in self-defence after he
challenged him about his alleged abuse of his daughter, Denise, when she
was a teenager. Denise claimed in court she had been raped and abused by
her father over a seven-month period.
The Crown claimed that Mrs Greig asked: ''Who will rid me of my
husband?'' and that Whiteside replied: ''I'll do it for you.'' The jury
heard claims that Mrs Greig handed her house keys to Laura to give to
Whiteside who used them to let himself in to carry out the murder.
Mr Edgar Prais, defence QC, said Mrs Greig may have been battered by
her husband and wanted him dead but that did not make her a murderess.
A second charge against Mrs Greig that she asked a man to kill her
husband and paid him #200 was dropped.

THE first substantial withdrawal of British troops from Northern
Ireland in more than a decade was announced yesterday amid warnings that
the Government should not use the fragile peace in the province as an
opportunity to force further defence cutbacks.
Between 400 and 500 men of 5 Regiment, Royal Artillery, who were due
to complete their six-month emergency tour in Fermanagh and Tyrone next
month, are to be flown back to the mainland over the next two weeks as a
first symbolic gesture towards recognition of a relaxation of tension.
But they will remain on standby at their Catterick base in Yorkshire,
and could be returned to Ulster within days if necessary. The battalion
scheduled to replace them is to complete its intensive
counter-insurgency training programme and will also remain on short
notice for deployment if the ceasefire breaks down.
The move will cut the number of major units stationed in the province
to 17. These include six resident garrison battalions on two-year tours,
five battalions on six-month tours, and six battalions of the
locally-recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Together with engineering
detachments, military police, other specialists and RAF helicopter and
support personnel, this amounts to about 17,000 men and women.
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said he had kept the number of
units under review since the IRA ceasefire declaration last August. The
decision to pull one unit out reflected the improved security situation,
and had been taken with full military and RUC agreement.
Sir Patrick added: ''The decision was taken solely on the basis of the
operational judgment of the security forces' commanders. It reflects a
further step towards normality.
''But it can be reversed quickly if the situation demands it. The
Government will continue to ensure that the police continue to receive
whatever level of military support the chief constable judges they
require.''
The move has, however, fuelled fears among campaigners against further
cuts in Army strength. Many see a phased withdrawal of perhaps four or
more regimental units from the province as a temptation for the Treasury
to demand further manpower cuts in the armed forces.
Mr Douglas Robson, a leading Scottish organiser of the Save the
Regiments campaign at the time of the Defence Ministry's Options for
Change round of cutbacks two years ago, said: ''This Government is
totally bankrupt in both honour and financial resources. It would not be
surprising if it seized on the lure of short-term cash savings to impose
further manpower reductions without due regard for the country's
strategic needs.''
Colonel Mike Ashmore, another principal campaigner, said: ''The
Government has made it absolutely clear that no further reductions in
the Army are planned. That is a matter of public and parliamentary
record.''
Mr David Wilshire, Tory MP for Spelthorne and a member of the Commons
Northern Ireland Select Committee, said the withdrawal would help the
peace process -- provided it had been done ''on the advice of those
responsible for security in Ulster and not as a political gesture''.
The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, who served in the
province as a Royal Marine, said: ''I think we should be withdrawing
troops in Northern Ireland as fast as the security situation allows. But
it would be irresponsible to withdraw them faster than is necessary.''
The Official Ulster Unionists said that they had been heavily involved
in the pull-out decision. Their security spokesman, Mr Ken Maginnis,
said: ''We are conscious of the need to ensure that our soldiers are not
frustrated by being undertasked or by being cooped up in barracks while
the present ceasefire is on-going.
''After consultation at the highest military level, we are content
that up to two battalions should return to alternative duties or
training, provided we have the assurance that they can be back within
seven days if required.''
Troops have been confined to barracks during daylight in Belfast and
Londonderry since last summer. Even night patrols and security sweeps in
the ''bandit country'' of South Armagh, Tyrone and Fermanagh have been
curtailed. Helicopter flights have been cut back drastically and most
road blocks have been lifted.
As a result, training and leisure facilities in crowded military
accommodation has been stretched to the limit throughout the province.
The removal of 5 Regiment will have a further bonus for the Army. Its
manpower is trained to use the expensive and technically complicated
Multiple Launch Rocket System employed to devastating effect during the
Gulf War.
Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie Mowlam said she welcomed
the withdrawal, which would mean that soldiers would not have to be
confined to barracks and separated unnecessarily from their families,
and from training.
Mr Mitchel McLaughlan, Sinn Fein's national chairman, described the
move as ''long overdue'', and said he hoped it was ''the beginning of a
process of complete demilitarisation which will see the permanent
withdrawal of all British troops back to their home bases in Britain''.
Intelligence sources estimate that the IRA has a weapons' cache
amounting to more than 150 tons of assault rifles, machine-guns, rocket
launchers and ammunition. Two shipments from Libya, admitted by Colonel
Gaddafi, have also given them enough Semtex plastic explosive to last
them well into the next century.

PROBLEMS continued to build up for the troubled, Glasgow-based Student
Loans Company yesterday in the wake of the dismissal of its chief
executive Ron Harrison.
Mr Harrison, who was sacked for ''errors of judgment and slackness''
over personal expenses, announced yesterday that he would contest his
dismissal in the courts.
He said through his lawyers yesterday: ''I deny all allegations of
impropriety and gross misconduct which have been made against me by my
former employers . . . My dismissal . . . is totally unjustified and
without foundation.''
One of the factors which, it is believed, played a part in his
dismissal was the introduction last year of a system for speedily
processing loan applications from existing borrowers.
But it ended in chaos as thousands of students throughout Britain
found themselves without their loans and in severe hardship by
Christmas.
To compound matters, the company could not handle the volume of
enquiries from desperate students. And higher education institutions had
warned the company that the systen was unworkable, but their advice was
ignored.
Now representatives of Scottish universities, who are being consulted
by the company about an alternative system for handling repeat
applications, are unhappy about aspects of its proposals.
The problems arose last year because students who, the company
considered, would seek another loan were sent application packs in May
or June, when they were involved in examinations, did not know if they
would be living at the same address, or if they would want another loan.
Thousands of others lost or did not receive their forms.
Despite protests from representatives of university registries and
student support services, the company is unwilling to end the policy of
sending out packs in May or June this year for repeat loans for next
session.
But it has agreed on a back-up system involving forms being held by
institutions. Students would fill them in, and institutions would send
them off to the company, which would trigger the re-application process.
One of the HE representatives said yesterday: ''The company wants to
improve its public image and do something about the re-appplication
process but it will probably be early next year before we can make a
judgment about whether it has listened to us.''
A spokesman for the company said: ''It is very much a consultation
process and the SLC is taking the views of representatives of students
and administrators. Any concern will be looked at closely.''
He said it would not be appropriate for the company to comment on Mr
Harrison's plans for legal action.

A chemistry student has
died after trying to control his sleep patterns with chloroform to
help him study longer for vital exams.
Mr Iain Fraser, 20, who was in his third year at Edinburgh University,
collapsed in his student accommodation in the Old Town after misjudging
a dosage of the potentially lethal poison.
Last night, at Robertson's Close, off the Cowgate, the flatmates of
the Inverness youth were too devastated to talk about their friend's
death through an experiment that went wrong.
It is believed that Mr Fraser, a student in science and engineering
who was approaching completion of a BSc ordinary degree, with final
examinations this summer, had been warned against taking this course by
friends.
His body, sprawled on his bed, was found by flatmate Colin McCloy
hours after he had taken the poison. Paramedics tried to revive him but
he was confirmed dead at the scene, where chloroform was found.
It is believed Mr Fraser inhaled the chloroform to knock himself out
when he returned from afternoon lectures so that he could wake up later
and study through the night.
The death of the student, who would have access to university
laboratories which held chloroform, often used as an anaesthetic, is not
being treated as a suspicious death.
Yesterday a Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said: ''It seems to
have been a tragic accident.''
Last night a spokesman for Edinburgh University said: ''Iain died
suddenly in his flat and all the usual procedures involving ambulance
and police were carried out.
''All we can do is express our sympathy to his family for their tragic
loss.''
The spokesman said he could not comment on the individual case but,
speaking generally, any students who took on a degree course committed
themselves to a rigorous process.
He went on: ''If there are students who face particular problems,
there is a wide-ranging provision of medical and pastoral support
services available which they are encouraged to make use of if they need
them.''
Asked if Mr Fraser had used the support services, the spokesman said
that if any students did, the matter was confidential.
A source in the pharmaceutical industry last night described
chloroform as a very potent anaesthetic.
It had not been used as an anaesthetic for many years because others
were safer, and was banned in the US.
Before university, Mr Fraser attended Charleston Academy in Inverness,
where he was said to be a popular pupil.
His parents, Mr James Fraser and his wife Sophie, also have three
daughters, and the family home is in the town's Ballifeary Lane.
Mr Fraser, a relief organist at a number of churches in the area,
including the West Parish Church where his son worshipped, said the
family was too upset to make any comment.
''This has been very distressing, especially for my wife. As far as we
are concerned it was an accident.''
The president of the National Union of Students in Scotland, Mr
Douglas Trainer said: ''We are aware that the pressure on students to
come out with a good classification is greater than it has ever been.
''Graduate unemployment is so high that students are pushing
themselves to the absolute limit.''

THREE leading football players in England, Bruce Grobbelaar, John
Fashanu, and Hans Segers, were in custody last night, held by police
investigating allegations of match-rigging.
Grobbelaar, the former Liverpool and current Southampton goalkeeper,
and Wimbledon's Segers, also a goalkeeper, were arrested at their
Hampshire homes by detectives early yesterday morning.
Fashanu, the Aston Villa and former Wimbledon striker and co-host of
London Weekend Television's Gladiators, was detained at an address near
Birmingham several hours later.
All three were being questioned by Hampshire detectives at police
stations in the county. Police also arrested Fashanu's girlfriend
Melissa Kassamapsi and a Malaysian businessman, Mr Heng Suan Lim, at two
addresses in London. All five were being held in custody overnight.
The arrests followed a huge international investigation that has seen
Hampshire detectives making inquiries in Malayasia and Zimbabwe.
The investigation also takes into account the recent arrest in
Malaysia of more than 40 football players on allegations of corruption.
It is claimed that these footballers were bribed to fix matches to
enable bookmakers to make huge profits.
Yesterday's arrests potentially make this the biggest scandal to have
hit the already embattled football set-up in England with the
implication that there could have been a conspiracy to fix Premiership
matches.
However, Football Association chiefs vigorously maintained that
English football was clean, with a spokesman stating ''corruption is not
rife in our national sport''.
Grobbelaar was questioned by police last November over newspaper
allegations of match-fixing from his former business partner, Mr Chris
Vincent.
The 37-year-old Zimbabwe international has consistently and
strenuously denied the allegations.
Mr Vincent, who has also been questioned by Hampshire detectives,
claimed Far Eastern gambling syndicates bet huge sums on the results of
big English games.
Detective Inspector Rod Davis, leading the inquiry, said the arrests
were ''in connection with allegations of corruption regarding league
football matches''.
He added: ''We are looking at a linking of the inquiry as far as the
individuals are concerned.''
The dramatic sequence of events began at 6.55am when Hampshire police
arrived at Grobbelaar's rented cottage in Lymington, on the edge of the
New Forest.
While Mr Grobbelaar might not have been anticipating being arrested,
the national media were out in force outside his rented home as the
police moved in. Detectives were in his house for more than an hour
before he was led away and driven to a Southampton police station.
Dutch-born Segers, 33, was picked up at the same time at his home in
Fleet.
Fashanu, 31, who has won two England caps, was arrested at an address
in Tamworth, near Birmingham at about 3pm.
Southampton's director of football, Mr Lawrie McMenemy said: ''It was
naturally fairly dramatic.
''The press were sitting waiting outside Bruce's door ready for the
police to arrive. All I know is that Bruce has been taken to a police
station to answer further questions.
''Life has to go on. We are waiting to see what happens. We have got a
game to play at The Dell tomorrow and will have to wait and see if he
can play.''
Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear said: ''It came like a bolt out of the
blue. I found out about the arest by phone at 9am. Up to now I have not
been able to contact Hans.''
Spokeswomen for Aston Villa and LWT would not comment on Fashanu's
position.
FA spokesman David Davies said: ''We remain convinced that corruption
is not rife in our national sport.
''To suggest that it is can be no more, no less, than a slur on the
integrity of hundreds and thousands of professional players who
represent clubs up and down the country.
''They resent that slur -- they are right to do so. But they also know
if there is any hint of corruption in the game, it must be disposed
of.''
He said the Football Association had ''every confidence'' in the way
the police investigation was proceeding. The FA's own inquiry had been
delayed on legal advice, he added.
''We believe an independent investigation of serious complaints
alleging criminal behaviour is the best way forward.
''Four months ago the FA asked anybody with evidence of corruption in
the game to come forward. What little has emerged has been passed on
immediately to investigating officers,'' said Mr Davies.
Mr Davies added in a statement from FA HQ in London that there were no
restrictions under its rules to prevent the three arrested men playing
for their clubs.
He said the decision rested with the clubs themselves. Mr Davies
added: ''We have confidence these decisions will be taken in the best
interests of the game as a whole.''
Brendan Batson, of the Professional Footballers' Association, said he
was ''shocked'' by the arrests.
''This season has just been a catalogue of bad news for football and
now it's taken an even more serious and dramatic turn,'' he said.
''Our biggest concern is that there is a growing perception that the
game is riddled with corruption -- and all of us involved in it know
that is simply not the case.''

SALES manager Hazel Rore called up some safe hands to help convert
enquiries into sales at the opening of Ogilvie Homes' Forth Park
development at Bridge of Allan, Stirling.
Scotland rugby stars Kenny Logan, Kenny Milne and Craig Chalmers were
just passing -- but managed to double (and divert) the crowd in minutes.
Hazel made her mark on the occasion, however, by slipping reservation
slips among the welter of autograph sheets. The lads were nonplussed to
find they had each bought a four-bedroom detached villa.
Nice try, Hazel!
Forth Park comprises 80 villas in a mix of two and three-bedroom
terraces, three-bedroom semi-detached villas, and three and four-bedroom
detached, at prices starting from #56,500.

When it comes to our new house, the lure of custom-built rather than
ready-to-wear is strong. Unfortunately, uniqueness seems to work out at
far more than we imagined. Simon Berry talks to an architect who
believes he can still provide it with a reasonable price tag.
PICTURE the scene. The surface of the placid loch reflects your dream
house against a background of natural birch and oak, rocks and
waterfalls. The house itself is a breathtaking creation with a glazed
front wall that parallels the water's edge and gives an uninterrupted
view of Ben Lomond on the far shore.
This two-storey house is no summer chalet. With four bedrooms and a
''granny flat'' (created out of the existing boathouse) it's a major
structure with a high-pitched slate roof, natural masonry walls and a
timber deck stretching out over the water. Plus that massive expanse of
curtain wall glazing.
It certainly isn't the ideal house for bargain hunters. According to
architect John Coleman to build it the traditional way (''handcarved''
is how he describes it) would not leave any change from #250,000. On the
other hand, he concedes that by making some aesthetic and structural
compromises it could be done for something nearer #200,000.
''This design is for a very specific and very special site on the west
shore of Loch Lomond just south of Tarbet. You descend steeply from the
road to this sliver of dry land which I calculated was just big enough
for a lochside house and some garden,'' says Coleman.
''It's major feature is the ripple of glass which goes from floor to
ceiling almost the full length of the eastern elevation. There are few
other windows in the house. It is a design that exists for its location
alone.''
Coleman's original design was granted planning consent several year
ago. This is a measure of the sympathetic qualities in his design
approach, using the expanse of roof to shield the glazed walls of the
living and dining rooms so making it less obtrusive to anyone enjoying
the loch. Around the back, he has also indulged in a large conservatory
and a pepper-pot stair tower.
His design for the moment remains just that. The site has changed
hands several times, but nothing has yet been built. Perhaps potential
clients are worried by the variation in the loch's level caused by the
Loch Sloy hydro pumping station nearby. Coleman is fairly philosophical
about it: a unique design requires a unique (and wealthy) client.
Fortunately for his practice, Glasgow-based Coleman Ballantine, does
not rely on such a rare species. They also have devised an approach to
providing more modest houses where the client retains the opportunity to
provide that unique touch.
Under a system Coleman calls Managed Self-Build you can buy from
Coleman Ballantine a quarter-acre plot and the ''shell'' of a house
built to your specification which you then divide up internally
according to your tastes and requirements.
This is an alternative to accepting the uniformity of product offered
by the volume house builders, although it could cost you a little more
-- probably at least #80,000. John Coleman understands why the current
housebuilding system has become predominant but feels bitter that the
architect has been edged out.
''The architect has never been more inexpensive and he has never been
more necessary,'' he exclaims. ''A builder can sell you a home from a
pretty picture and a showhouse. How do you know that it will really meet
your requirements? How can you test-drive it to find out its performance
specifications?
''It's now possible to order and pay for a new house over the phone,
but you could spend years living in an environment that's not right for
you. Architects should now be looking for ways of providing this kind of
facilitating service that people will value and pay for.''About the
Practice:The Coleman Ballantine Partnership has carried out major
housing schemes both in Scotland and abroad. Among landmark buildings in
Scotland are the Stirling Highland hotel and the Central Mosque in
Glasgow. They have also carried out leisure and hosing projects in Spain
and Gibraltar.

A HOUSING development in the grounds of one of Stirling's finest
architectural assets, a nineteenth-century former nursing home designed
by the eccentric John Allan, is one of three new sites started by
Dundee-based Bett Homes as it continues its penetration of the central
belt and West of Scotland.
The other two developments are at Newton Mearns and Falkirk. All three
are small, prestigious developments in sought-after locations.
The company says that demand has been particularly high at its Newton
Mearns site, Woodlea, which is close to Mearnskirk Hospital. Woodlea
will feature 18 homes, a mix of four and five-bedroom detached homes
with garages in a choice of four styles. Prices range from #189,000 to
#212,000.
The Rothesay showhome, a five-bedroom detached house with integral
double garage (#212,000), is due to open in spring.
The Stirling development, called The Pines, is set in the grounds of
the former Batterflats nursing home in Polmaise Road. The distinctive
exterior of the building is being saved and Bett Homes is planting new
pine trees as well as retaining the landscape, which has more than 70
mature trees.
This upmarket development will feature 20 homes in four styles. In
addition, six three-bedroom apartments are being built. Prices range
from #174,950 to #211,950 for the four and five-bedroom detached homes
with garages.
The Blair showhome, a four-bedroom detached house priced at #198,950,
is due to open in May.
Batterflats was built in 1892 and was designed by the eccentric
Stirling architect John Allan. It is ranked by the local Society of
Architects as one of the finest buildings in Stirling.
Lochgreen, Falkirk, Lochgreen is a site of traditionally built homes
in Lochgreen Road, featuring 15 Bett Homes. Prices range from #96,250 to
#137,250.
Terry Hawksby, managing director of Bett Homes, said: ''We are greatly
encouraged by the positive feedback from home-buyers in the West and
sales are already ahead of schedule for the first quarter of 1995. The
classic style of the homes combined with the developments' attractive
locations have tremendous appeal for the local communities.''

<HEADLINE>Riot at the Maze leaves 50 injured</HEADLINE>

RIOTING loyalist prisoners last night left more than 50 officers
needing treatment after wrecking part of the top-security Maze jail in
Northern Ireland.
Three officers were beaten on the head with iron bars when staff
clashed with UVF men suspected of trying to hide a bag of drugs as a
search was about to begin. At least one fire was started as prisoners
smashed property and climbed on the roof in their section of the jail
near Lisburn, County Antrim. One prisoner brandished an automatic rifle.
The disturbances, which lasted almost 10 hours, ended shortly after
8pm, according to the Northern Ireland Office. A spokesman said all
prisoners had been secured and staff had taken control.
He added: ''Considerable damage has been caused but a full assessment
will not be made until tomorrow.''
One injured officer was said to be very seriously ill. Another two
were described as serious and upwards of 5O more had to be withdrawn
from duty because of minor injuries, smoke inhalation, and stress. One
prisoner was injured.
Last night, Northern Ireland Security Minister Sir John Wheeler said
the trouble had been caused by a ''bunch of thugs''. He added: ''All
prisons are volatile throughout the world, particularly those in
democracies because we have liberal regimes.''
Staff blamed the trouble on prison authorities whom they accused of
agreeing a deal and virtually handing over control to the prisoners in a
bid to prevent unrest since the start of the ceasefires.
Mr Finlay Spratt, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association,
claimed large quantities of drugs and weapons were hidden in the jail.
He said: ''We warned management this would happen because of the
concessions. The prisoners have been running the Maze for years.
''Staff are totally demoralised. There is no leadership. The place
needs to be searched from top to bottom. There is everything in there --
drugs, guns, and they even have their own mobile telephones. It's a
disgrace.''
At the height of the violence, about 15O UVF men, many of serving life
sentences for murder, were involved. The trouble spread from H-Block 1
when an officer was attacked by two prisoners as he tried to recover a
bag which staff believed contained drugs.
Staff claimed they had twice warned management in January that more
trouble was on the cards because of poor discipline.
Mr Spratt said: ''We are all in favour of a relaxed regime. The
prisoners and management entered into an agreement last August (the time
of the IRA ceasefire) and in return for cells being left unlocked for 24
hours every day and getting more money to spend, the prisoners would
co-operate in security checks and searches.
''The discipline had broken down completely. There are rave parties in
the jail every Saturday night. What's happening is a scandal and
management can't say they were not warned. If there is abuse on this
scale, then all privileges should be withdrawn.''
The Northern Ireland Office said it was not prepared to negotiate with
the POA through the media. A statement said staff could raise their
concerns through the proper channels.

A 31-YEAR-old man from Linwood in Renfrew was shot at his front door
last night while his family and friends watched television.
Mr Andrew Laughrie McLaughlin was shot several times and was dead on
arrival at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.
It is believed that police may be linking his murder with two
shootings in Paisley on Sunday.
Mr McLaughlin was watching television at his home at Armour Place with
his brother Mark, 23, and a friend at about 7.30pm when he heard a noise
at his front door.
He went to the door and was shot several times.
His fiancee, her two-year-old daughter and his own nine-year-old
daughter were watching television in an upstairs room at the time.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said last night that they were
treating the shooting as murder.
As yet, they had no descriptions or idea of motive, he added.
On Sunday, two men were injured in separate shooting incidents which
police believe may be linked.
Mr John Kennedy, 51, a street trader of Netherhill Road, was shot in
the Storrie Street car-park, and Mr John Kelly, 36, of Millerston
Avenue, was shot in the Park Bar in Thomas Street.
Both men were taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Mr Kelly's
condition was described as ''serious but stable'' and Mr Kennedy's
condition as not giving cause for concern.

LOCAL council tenants will be given the first chance to buy at Wimpey
Homes's new site in Sikeside, Coatbridge.
The development is a partnership with Monklands District Council,
Lanarkshire Development Agency, and Scottish Homes, with 25 of the
site's 108 homes being built for GAP Housing Association use and the
remainder for private sale.
Local tenants in houses owned by the council, Scottish Homes, or the
housing association will be offered the remaining 83 homes on a priority
basis, with 28 days to buy before the homes go on the open market.
The estate will comprise two and three-bedroom terrace and
semi-detached homes. Selling is due to start on site in June.
Dave Scott, Wimpey's health and safety officer, visited Sikeside
Primary School which is opposite the development, to discuss the hazards
of playing on building sites with the schoolchildren.

THE Prime Minister has kept Mr Bill Clinton waiting for four days
before returning a call the US President made last Saturday.
When the White House tried to connect the two leaders, it was told Mr
Major would answer the President's call when he returned from his Middle
East tour.
The day before Mr Major had dispatched a frosty note to the President
concerning his decision to invite Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to the
White House on Friday and to permit his party's fund raising again.
That fund raising was quickly under way. Sinn Fein opened its first
office in the US yesterday, in Washington close to the diplomatic
quarter.
The situation was a humiliating experience for the Prime Minister and
his Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, who only the week
before had argued in Washington against such a decison.
For two days it has been known Mr Clinton was trying to contact the
Prime Minister on the phone, but it emerged only last night that the
call was made on Saturday before Mr Major had left England for the
Middle East.
It had been thought the President's call was made on Monday when the
Prime Minister was in a helicopter travelling to the Golan Heights.
Questioned yesterday in Gaza, the Prime Minister said: ''I have been
fairly mobile in the last couple of days . . . the President and I speak
often. If he wishes to do so, we will speak. That is true the other way
round. If he has been pursuing me, I am sure he will find me soon. We
will make sure he does.''
So at last it emerges that Mr Major chose not to respond to the
President last Saturday as an explicit reprimand for being over-ruled
twice concerning American visas for Mr Adams.
However, Mr Major last night received what is described as a
''constructive'' response to his stern note to Mr Clinton concerning Mr
Adams and could indicate the President now feels that he must deliver
IRA weapons to the British and Irish Governments.
This was reinforced when US National Security Adviser Anthony Lake met
Mr Adams at the White House and urged him to follow through quickly on a
promise to discuss IRA disarmament with the British. An official said Mr
Adams responded positively to Mr Lake's appeal.
The Irish Prime Minister, Mr James Bruton, flew out for New York where
he will have at least two meetings with Mr Adams, as well as seeing the
President. Mr Bruton said: ''We have got to get some movement in the
arms question.''
