YOU'VE either got it or you haven't. Presence, that is. Last Tuesday
lunchtime, Claire Martin took the Festival Theatre stage with a pick-up
trio and with a short, three-song set left a major impression on the
30-odd souls attending Edinburgh International Jazz Festival's launch,
most of whose attention was more focused on the refreshments to follow.
On Friday evening, in a more intimate venue but with a larger and more
committed audience and her regular trio, Martin confirmed her recently
conferred status as Britain's top jazz singer with a performance that,
although not quite as immediately appreciated as Tuesday's, bristled
with assurance and musicality.
For five songs she coolly tripped off the wordplay that she so
obviously relishes in songs such as Michael Franks's Monk's New Tune,
which has more bends than the old A9, without causing too much ado.
Then, as she handed over the belting When The Sun Comes Out to pianist
Gareth Williams, her audience suddenly seemed to realise just how good
the first half-hour had been.
Rupert Holmes's clever Partners In Crime caused an outbreak of exotic
dancing by the stage and Martin's saxophone-like improvised lines (like
Betty Carter, she regards herself as one of a wholly integrated quartet
rather than the singer with a backing trio) inspired appreciative yelps.
Martin's voice, always smoky, has grown increasingly so as her
communicative but never over-demonstrative stage persona has matured.
And though not always reaching her upper register comfortably, her
near-whispering means of getting there can be very effective. As was the
almost spoken ballad Would You Believe, a tribute to Carmen McRae, a big
influence and one whose lessons are being put to good use indeed.

I VERY much doubt if the Forth and Clyde estuaries could be seen from
the Slamannan plateau (May 22).
However, on the north side of the Forth and Clyde valley there is what
I consider to be the most interesting view in all Scotland. It takes in
the full lengths of the Antonine Wall, the canal, the LNER railway line,
an airport, motorways, drove roads, a new town, and several old villages
and towns.
Over to the west can be seen Glasgow, Arran, and Paddy's Milestone. To
the east are pollution-producing Grangemouth, the two bridges, Auld
Reekie, and the Bass Rock.
From this viewpoint you are aware and gain an appreciation of the
social and industrial development which has taken place over centuries
from Roman times to ultra-technological modern factories, and all this
is from a modest wee hill called Tomtain.
I hope your correspondent will make his way to this spot one day. He
will find it full of interest.

SCOTLAND'S 3000 corner shops are still fighting a losing battle
against supermarkets and discount stores.
But Morning, Noon and Night, which operates an expanding chain of
convenience stores throughout Scotland, has come up with some tips for
survival.
Chief executive Eddie Thompson told the Scottish Wholesale Grocers'
Conference in Dunblane at the weekend that long opening hours, the right
product mix and the ability to cater for local residents without cars
were important keys to success.
Based in Dundee, Morning, Noon and Night has opened 23 convenience
stores throughout Scotland since it was founded with the help of venture
capital in 1991.
The company has an annual turnover of #16m and expects to announce an
increase in profits for the year to March 31.
Mr Thompson said a successful local shop had to have the right site in
the community it served and be prepared to open from 7am to 10pm, seven
days a week.
It was also vital for the shop to sell newspapers, magazines, lottery
scratch cards, and alcohol in addition to the usual range of groceries
and tobacco, he added.
Morning, Noon and Night stores have seen a 7% increase in turnover
since the national lottery was launched, Mr Thompson noted.
Many convenience stores are situated in deprived areas and Mr Thompson
said these should cater particularly for the needs of the unemployed and
those on low incomes.
Such people do not have personal transport to go shopping further
afield and often treat the local shop as a social meeting place,
visiting it up to two or three times a day, he noted.
Older people, who often have a greater disposable income and who
prefer to shop within their own community, should also be targetted as
customers, Mr Thompson said.
Although the overall number of independent grocers in the UK has
plummeted to 32,000 from 85,000 during the last 25 years, Mr Thompson
noted that they have been more resilient in Scotland than in the rest of
the country.
He quoted figures produced by the Institute of Grocery Distribution as
showing that independent grocers hold a 14% market share in Scotland
compared to only 10% in the rest of the UK.

<HEADLINE>Nationwide search on for patients in hepatitis scare. Infected dentist treated thousands</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEITH SINCLAIR</BYLINE>

A SEARCH has been launched to trace thousands of people in Scotland
who have been treated by a dentist at the centre of the latest hepatitis
B scare.
An estimated 7000 people around the country are to be contacted after
the dentist was found to be carrying the potentially fatal virus.
Letters of advice will be sent this week to current and former
patients of the dentist -- whose identity has not been revealed -- but
health officials stress that they believe the risk of anyone being
infected is minimal. Those still concerned after receiving advice will
be offered a blood test.
The exercise, which is being co-ordinated by the Scottish Centre for
Infections and Environmental Health at Ruchill Hospital, Glasgow, will
also include a free telephone helpline staffed by trained counsellors.
The dentist, who has worked in the Highlands, Falkirk, Lanarkshire,
and Glasgow, discovered he was carrying hepatitis B virus after taking a
routine screening. He stopped working immediately and is said to be
distressed by the news.
Health boards in areas where he worked were contacted a week ago and
held an emergency joint meeting to launch the search for patients.
The man worked as a community-based dentist in the Highlands between
1986 and 1988 -- his first post after graduating.
Highland Health Board's director of public health, Dr Andrew Fraser,
yesterday would not identify the dentist or the area where he was based.
He said it contained only a small number of dentists and he could be
easily pinpointed if it were revealed.
A spokeswoman at Greater Glasgow Health Board declined to specify
where the dentist worked and how many patients he may have had in the
city, and referred calls to the Scottish Office. No-one at Forth Valley
Health Board or Lanarkshire Health Board could be contacted.
A Scottish Office spokesman, who stressed that any risk to patients
was minimal, declined to talk in detail about the case, and said only:
''Protocols have been established for infectious conditions like this
and steps are being taken by the health boards concerned.''
The spokesman also declined to specify how many people the dentist may
have seen in each of the other areas where he worked, although one
report suggested that he treated 100 patients while at Falkirk Royal
Infirmary.
Speaking at a news conference in Inverness, Dr Fraser said the case
caused concern, but added: ''There are no reported instances worldwide
of patients catching the hepatitis B virus from their dentist where
adequate control procedures are in operation.''
He stressed that the Highland practice involved operated to a very
high standard of infection control, adding that a study showed there was
no connection between reported hepatitis B cases in the region and the
dentist in question.
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver caused mainly by viruses,
although it can be triggered by other causes including drugs, alcohol,
and immune system disturbances.
While not related to HIV, it is transmitted from person to person in
much the same way, through coming into contact with the body fluids of a
carrier by sexual contact, intravenous drug use, or contamination with
blood or other body fluids.
Hepatitis B can be much more infectious than Aids, has a six-month
incubation period, and can remain in the bloodstream for many years.
However, it is almost impossible to become infected if your skin has
not been broken.
Jaundice is the most obvious symptom and in many cases there is a
flu-like illness with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and pain in
the joints.
In some cases patients suffer long-term liver damage and at its most
serious hepatitis B can lead to severe loss of liver function, which can
be fatal.

SCOTLAND make eight changes and a positional adjustment for their
crucial RWC game against Tonga in the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria,
tomorrow night.
The selection of Stirling County centre Ian Jardine is particularly
timely, the Bridgehaugh man celebrating his thirtieth birthday yesterday
as the team was announced.
The tussle against the South Sea Islanders -- whom Scotland beat 23-5
in Tonga two years ago -- is particularly significant in that both sides
view it as the key to qualification for the quarter-finals.
Tonga will expect to beat Ivory Coast, as Scotland have done in
record-breaking fashion, and, mistakenly from a partisan viewpoint, will
have looked upon their game against France as being a tougher test than
that against the Scots.
It was a point conceded by team manager Duncan Paterson yesterday.
''Tonga have probably targeted the Scottish game. If they are going to
qualify, then that is the one that they would be hoping to win. If we
win on Tuesday night then, basically, we are in the quarter-finals, but
I am sure that the Tongans will be thinking the same way.
''No disrespect to Ivory Coast, but Tonga will be expecting to beat
them and it is still all to play for on Tuesday night.''
Jardine and Scott Hastings -- both fierce midfield tacklers -- form a
new centre partnership against the physical Tongans, who had a man sent
off in their opening match against France on Friday.
The contest for top billing in the Scottish midfield continues
unabated and is given added spice by Paterson's assertion that places
are still available for le crunch game against France. Scotland are
particularly well endowed with talent at centre, with Hastings, who is
desperate to show what he can do in attack -- ''My motto this season is
attack the gap'' -- Jardine, Shiel, who played particularly well against
Ivory Coast, and Tony Stanger still battling for supremacy and
preferment against the Tricolors on Saturday.
Paterson said he wished Scotland were blessed with such riches
elsewhere, perhaps referring to the fact that record-breaker Gavin
Hastings is again in the side and, barring injury, looks likely to play
in all three pool games.
The younger Hastings said yesterday: ''Now that I have the chance I
have to use all of my experience to produce a performance. In many
respects this is my last chance and I am desperate to show that I am up
to it.''
Jardine, who played against Tonga two years ago, reckons that the
Islanders' exposure to top sides in the Super Ten series will have seen
their game progress.
''We saw against France that they are a very good side, skilful and
physical. They are a lot like the Western Samoans. However, in a way I'd
rather play against them than the likes of Ivory Coast, because they
play a more physical game that suits my own style of play.''
Derrick Patterson, a late call-up for the squad after injury to Bath's
Andy Nicol, makes his tournament debut at scrum half, playing his first
game in Scottish colours since the defeat by South Africa at Murrayfield
last autumn.
He said: ''Euphemistically, you could say that this season has been
'rather testing' for me. It started well. I was playing good rugby for
West Hartlepool and I got my first cap against South Africa. Then I was
dropped and it all started to go wrong.
''There was no point, though, in mouthing off about it. If I'd done
so, then maybe I wouldn't have been here.''
In the pack, the selectors have gone for the first-choice, form
players, with Dave Hilton and Kenny Milne replacing Paul Burnell and
Kevin McKenzie, who played in the 89-0 win over Ivory Coast.
Damian Cronin, who like Ian Jardine was injured against France in
February, is restored to the middle-row of the scrummage, the Bourges
lock having played only 27 minutes of rugby since then, a hamstring
causing him problems in the warm-up game against Spain.
The Five Nations' back-row unit of Iain Morrison, Rob Wainwright, and
Eric Peters will line up against Tonga, Wainright back on the flank from
No.8, where he performed against Ivory Coast.
Tonga will provide a much sterner test for Scotland than did Ivory
Coast on Friday. As Paterson put it: ''Ivory Coast was a difficult
situation, being our World Cup opener. In many respects it was
spectacular, but in other respects there were mistakes made and we have
been critical of our performance.
''In many ways, we are now into the reality of the World Cup. Tonga
will be a different proposition and the games will get increasingly
harder from here on in,'' he declared.
Certainly, and despite the 38-10 scoreline, Tonga gave the French a
scare on Friday. France led only 6-0 at half-time and had Tongan full
back Sateki Tu'ipolotu been in better goal-kicking fettle, an upset
might have been on.
The Tongans have made three changes to their side, schoolboy Unoi
Va'enuku coming in at centre.
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians), C A Joiner (Melrose), S
Hastings (Watsonians), I C Jardine, K M Logan (both Stirling County); C
M Chalmers (Melrose) D W Patterson (West Hartlepool); D I W Hilton

DAMON Hill's dream of joining his illustrious father on the Monaco
Grand Prix roll of honour was firmly crushed for another year by Michael
Schumacher yesterday.
Hill had to settle for second place after the German giant judged his
tactics to perfection to win a collision-infested race, with Gerhard
Berger well back in third.
Schumacher's victory extended his championship lead to five points
over Hill, who was hoping to follow his father, Graham, on to the
victory podium 26 years after the last of his famous five triumphs.
The 34-year-old was also aiming to become the first British driver to
win on Monte Carlo's narrow street circuit since Jackie Stewart's third
and final victory in 1972.
But there was further Benetton joy for Johnny Herbert, who followed up
his runner-up spot behind Schumacher in Spain with a fourth place to
move to fifth place outright in the drivers' standings.
Mark Blundell capped an incredible comeback with a points-scoring
fifth place -- just five days after having replaced Nigel Mansell in the
heavily-criticised Marlboro McLaren.
Blundell has been given just two races to prove he is worth a
long-term contract, but boosted his chances by adding to the point he
collected for finishing sixth in Brazil when Mansell's cockpit was being
rebuilt.
David Coulthard, involved in a collision with Jean Alesi that forced a
restart, eventually abandoned after 16 laps while Eddie Irvine's race
lasted just six more laps before he pulled up in the Jordan.
Ligier's Martin Brundle went out after 43 laps -- ironically ending
Alesi's interest at the same time when the Frenchman, keeping Hill out
of second place, clipped the back of Brundle's spinning car.
Hill looked on course for his craved-for victory when he twice took
advantage of the pole position he had brilliantly gained in the Williams
Renault on Saturday to head Schumacher. But after having passed the lead
on to his chief rival when he went into the pits for the first time,
Hill was never able to regain it.
He said: ''We were going to do a one-stop, but after our performance
in the warm-up we reconsidered the situation. We got it horribly wrong
I'm afraid.''
By the time he emerged from the pits for a second time, Hill was 35
seconds down on the world champion and that proved too much.
Schumacher's one-stop strategy was decisive as he won his second
successive grand prix and thirteenth of his career by 34 seconds. It was
also his second win in a row at Monaco. Details:
1, M Schumacher (Germany) Benetton-Renault 1hr 53min 11.258sec; 2, D
Hill (Britain) Williams-Renault, at 34.817sec; 3, G Berger (Austria)
Ferrari, at 1-11.447; 4, J Herbert (Britain) Benetton, at 1 lap; 5, M

World drivers' championship standings (after five races): 1, M
Schumacher (Ger) 34pts; 2, D Hill (Britain) 29; 3, G Berger (Austria)
17; 4, J Alesi (France) 14; 5, J Herbert (Britain) 12; 6, D Coulthard

M Blundell (Britain) 3; 10, E Irvine (Britain) 2; 11, O Panis (France)

Constructors' championship standings: 1, Benetton 36; 2, Williams 32;
3, Ferrari 31; 4, McLaren 8; 5, Sauber 4; 6, Jordan 2; 7, Ligier 1.
(Benetton deducted 10 points and Williams six for fuel irregularities).

<TEXT>
BERNHARD Langer, having set a European Tour record of making 57
consecutive cuts, yesterday manoeuvred into position to claim his
thirty-second victory. In the third round of the Volvo PGA championship,
the 37-year-old German had a 68 to share a one-stroke lead on 208, eight
under par, improbably with Mark Mouland, of Wales, whose 65 was the
lowest score so far.
A rousing finish today now seems certain from a cosmopolitan group of
challengers. Sweden's Per-Ulrik Johansson birdied the last four holes to
share second place with Andrew Sherborne of England, whose last two
wayward drives thwarted him of the birdies that were commonplace, a
stroke ahead of Nick Faldo and 48-year-old Jose-Maria Canizares of
Spain, who birdied three of the last four holes.
With Gary Orr unable to redress a miserable start of four over after
only six holes, the leading Scot, unsurprisingly, was Colin Montgomerie.
He was on 211 with another Swede, Jesper Parnevik, who had gains at five
of the last six holes, and Thomas Levet of France, and, given the
potential for a really low score, the holder, Jose Maria Olazabal,
although five behind, could not be totally disregarded.
Langer almost matched Severiano Ballesteros and Mark James, who played
together early, in producing a score free of a bogey -- under greater
pressure as he was, and also playing later in a strengthening, swirling
breeze to pin positions both exacting and unfamiliar. But having
produced almost flawless golf, Langer smudged his card at the last.
Seeking to add to his five birdies, Langer, from the middle of the
fairway, blocked a No.3 wood into a rhododendron bush. He was less able
to admire its colours than chip the ball out with a two-foot backswing,
and he missed from seven feet for par. But Langer has twice won the
title over the 6957-yard West course and will be difficult to dislodge.
By contrast Faldo, who had offset three bogeys with three birdies, had
a kindlier result after his last second shot struck a tree. The ball
bounced into play and Faldo made the most of his chance by pitching to
eight feet for the birdie which might be crucial to his hopes of a fifth
championship.
Mouland, 34, and winner of the British Boys' title 19 years ago, had
two victories to his credit, but none since 1988. Perhaps having become
one of the Tour's freer spirits accounts for his lack of further success
in a real and earnest age. But recently he has practised more and
caroused less, so that two drinks are enough of an evening and 10pm
counts as a late night.
''I've held myself back over the last five years,'' Mouland
acknowledged. ''Now I want to show what I can do.'' His target this
season is #100,000 and victory would exceed that amount by #50,000.
During his second 65 over the course he completed an outward 32 with an
eagle 2 at the 398-yard eighth, where he holed his No.8-iron approach.
Montgomerie's holing out was not as successful as Sandy Lyle's. ''I'm
a born-again putter,'' Lyle declared after having holed five single
putts on an inward 33, including a monster of 75 feet at the long
seventeenth to eagle that hole with his second ball and save par, the
first having been hooked out of bounds from the tee.
But Montgomerie was not inclined to complain. He three-putted twice in
the first six holes and was one over par for the championship. ''I
couldn't win from that position,'' he said afterwards, ''but I can
now.'' Having covered the last 12 holes with six birdies from putts of
between eight and 30 feet, his only regret was to have missed from 10
feet at the last to be further in contention.
Lyle was round in 71, as were Kevin Stables and Gordon Brand Jr, but
Orr and his partner, Philip Walton, starting in the shadow of the
overnight leader, Frank Nobilo, fared only marginally better than the
New Zealander.
0  Orr cut his opening drive deep into trees and bunkered his second
at the third and instantly gave back three strokes, as did the Irishman,
who also took 14 strokes over the first three holes.

ANDRE Agassi can embark upon making history today by becoming the
first man to win Grand Slam titles on four different surfaces.
Just how great the world No.1's chances are as he begins his challenge
for the French Open title is anybody's guess. After all, Paris has
proved a graveyard for those pursuing the holy grail of Grand Slam
titles, but Agassi himself would gladly swop his top ranking for victory
in Paris.
''To win at Roland Garros is more important to me than being number
one,'' he said. ''To win all four Grand Slam tournaments would be an
extraordinary achievement.''
Pete Sampras, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, and Jimmy Connors have all
been down the same path and failed -- winning the Australian, Wimbledon,
and US Open titles, but getting bogged down time and again on the clay
of Roland Garros.
Unlike the rest, however, Agassi is a natural clay player and the real
puzzle is that he did not win the French before mastering the grass of
Wimbledon, Flushing Meadow's cement, and the synthetic surface of
Flinders Park.
Agassi has, however, made just one venture on European clay, ending in
a lacklustre quarter-final defeat to reigning French champion Sergi
Bruguera, of Spain, in Hamburg last month.
The task is unusually daunting this year with Bruguera and Thomas
Muster, of Austria, heading a long cast of players who look potentially
capable of winning the title.
The Spaniard, winner in 1993 and last year, could become the only
player apart from Bjorn Borg to have won the French title three years in
a row.
Muster is on a prolonged, giddy roll on clay, capturing five titles
this season to emerge with an unbeaten run of 28 matches on the surface.
The women's singles looks unpredictable after years of domination by
the Graf-Seles-Sanchez triumvirate.
Inevitably, Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario are in line, but
they have been joined by two other claimants, France's Mary Pierce and
Conchita Martinez, of Spain.
Pierce rocketed to fame last year when she unexpectedly reached the
Paris final, hammering Graf in the semi-finals before losing to Sanchez.
Victory in this year's Australian Open, with a revenge win over her
Spanish rival, has fuelled expectations of a first win at Roland Garros
by a Frenchwoman since Francoise Durr in 1967.
If Pierce should meet Martinez in the final, it would be the first
time neither Graf nor Sanchez had reached the women's showdown since
1986.
Martinez's easy victory over Sanchez in this month's Italian Open
final in Rome, one day after beating Pierce, speaks volumes for her
chances.

CHRIS Eubank launched a furious attack on the man who took away his
World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight title after winning his
comeback fight in less than a round at the King's Hall, Belfast, on
Saturday night.
He stopped bloodstained Argentinian Bruno Godoy to set up a summer
rematch against Steve Collins, then he fuelled what is certain to be a
bitter second clash by accusing Collins of ''cheating.''
Eubank was upset that the Irishman claimed to have consulted a
hypnotist before the fight. He maintained Collins pushed him at the
weigh-in -- then gouged and tripped him in the ring.
''His whole conduct was appalling, his tactics deplorable and
embarrassing,'' said Eubank. ''He is a cheat. I have contempt for the
man and I will bang him out next time.''
Purse offers for the contest will be opened tomorrow. Barry Hearn, who
manages both men, plans to stage it in Dublin in late July if his bid is
successful.
Saturday night's brief action was not enough to pass judgment on
Eubank's pledge to become a more ruthless fighter. He cut Godoy on the
bridge of the nose after 30 seconds. A second gash over the left eye
prompted referee Larry O'Connell to intervene with 15 seconds of the
round left.
Eubank said of suggestions that heads were responsible: ''It didn't
seem like it to me. But that's the fight game.''
Eamonn Loughran kept the WBO welterweight title, but not the way he
wanted in his third defence. His fight against Angel Beltre, of the
Dominican Republic, was declared a 'no contest' after WBO officials
studied a television replay of a clash of heads in the third round which
left the challenger cut over the right eye and unable to continue.
They reversed the decision of referee Roberto Ramirez, who had
declared Loughran the winner, because three rounds had not been
completed.
Ramirez reckoned a punch opened the cut, but honest Loughran admitted:
''I slipped his jab and as I ducked under, my head collided with his. It
was just one of those things.''

TURRIFF'S Mark Thurston clinched a spot in July's Woolwich Scottish
Masters at Aberdeen when he won the north-east qualifier at the Northern
Club yesterday with a 7-4, 7-4 win over New Deer's David Anderson.
Thurston, a reserve in Scotland's side last year in the home
international championship, picked up a maximum 4 on the third end of
the opening set, and three more on the sixth gave him the set 7-4 with
Anderson's counts coming from four singles.
Thurston then took a 6-2 lead after four ends of the second set and a
single two ends later wrapped up his place in the town's #12,000 event.
Results:
First round -- I Bruce (Kincardine O'Neil) beat A McIntosh
(Stonehaven) 7-3, 7-6; D Anderson (New Deer) beat I Laird (Insch) 7-2,
7-2; M Thurston (Turriff) beat B Jessiman (Inverurie) 7-5, 7-3; J
Robertson (Monquhitter) beat G Stuart (Northern) 7-5, 7-4.
Semi-finals -- Thurston beat Robertson 7-0, 7-0; Anderson beat Bruce
6-7, 7-6, 7-6.
Final -- Thurston beat Anderson 7-4, 7-4.

LARISA Neiland picked up her third World Doubles Cup title and a share
in the first prize of #43,500 when she partnered Meredith McGrath to a
6-2, 7-6 victory over Manon Bollegraf and Rennae Stubbs in Saturday's
final in front of a capacity Craiglockhart crowd.
Rain delayed the start of the match for 30 minutes, and the Latvian
doubles expert and her American partner found themselves a break down
after the opening game. But they replied immediately and broke the
fragile Bollegraf serve in the second and sixth games before capturing
Stubbs' delivery in the eighth to pocket the first set.
The Dutch-Australian pair looked to be in control of the second set
when they produced some delightful touches to establish a 3-1 lead. But
they failed to convert four break points on Neiland's serve in the fifth
game and the favourites drew level by breaking Bollegraf in the sixth.
The second seeds regained control when they broke Neiland for the
third time in the ninth game and had their sights set on levelling the
match when the Dutch player lined up for a simple overhead at 5-4,
30-30. But Bollegraf had the crowd diving for cover as the ball smacked
off the top of her racket and into the stand.
''I think it was probably the worst shot I have ever hit and it came
at such a crucial time. If I'd made it we'd have had set point but,
instead, it gave them a chance to break,'' she explained.
McGrath, the only player to hold serve throughout the 95-minute match,
agreed that the Bollegraf blunder was ''definitely the turning point.''
She added: ''It was a very easy smash and it allowed us to get back in.
We had to survive another break point on my serve in the eleventh game,
but eventually we got through when Larisa produced an ace on the ninth
point of the tie-break. I wouldn't say it was the best match we've ever
played but we're happy that we won.''
The Women's Tennis Association have confirmed that the $188,000 event
will return to the capital's new #3.1m tennis centre for at least
another two years along with the Legends Tournament, which was won by
former world No.1 Tracy Austin and John Lloyd, 7-5, 6-1 victors over
South African Johan Kriek and Virginia Wade.

AT the outset of the women's international tournament at Lisburn,
Scotland could hardly have dreamt that by Sunday evening they would have
beaten Ireland twice and run world champions Australia to a single goal.
Yet, they could have done better, particularly in the second contest
with Australia on Saturday, when they twice nullified scores by Simone
Wallington and Michelle Andrews with strikes by Wendy Fraser and Susan
MacDonald after 60 minutes.
But with just 30 seconds remaining, a 16-yard hit was rushed and the
ball went straight to Alyson Annan, who responded by bursting into the
circle and putting the ball well beyond the reach of Tracey Robb.
Scotland then sealed second place in the tournament by overcoming
their hosts 2-0 yesterday through goals by MacDonald and Rhona Simpson.
Results:
Saturday -- Scotland 2, Australia 3; Australia 4, Ireland 0. Yesterday
-- Australia 4, Ireland 0; Scotland 2, Ireland 0.

SHINTY
THE Camanachd Association are seeking a major sponsor to replace
Glenmorangie who this week mark the end of an 18-year association with
the sport at the Camanachd Cup final.
However, President Duncan Cameron remains optimistic.
He told the association's annual meeting in Fort William at the
weekend: ''We have conducted an exhaustive trawl of companies for a new
sponsor, and are confident that a replacement will be found.''
The meeting agreed to introduce penalty shoot-outs at the end of extra
time if Camanachd Cup finals are drawn, although this will not apply to
Saturday's match between Kingussie and Oban Camanachd.
The final, which will take place in Oban, has been brought forward to
2 o'clock to enable Radio Scotland to provide full live coverage.
Results:
London Shield. Final -- Kilmallie 2, Oban Celtic 0. Strathdearn Cup.
Final -- Beauly 0, Kingussie 3. Valerie Fraser Cup. Semi-final --
Inverness 2, Lochcarron 3. McLaren Cup. Semi-final -- Lochside Rovers 3,
Kyles Athletic 2. Marine Harvest League. Division 2 -- Glasgow
University 5, Kintyre 1.

DAVID Platt was sent off in Sampdoria's 2-2 draw with Inter-Milan on
the penultimate Sunday of the Italian season.
The England captain was dismissed after 59 minutes after handling
Marco Delvecchio's shot on the line -- only for Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp
to hit a post with the resultant penalty.
But Inter salvaged a point in their battle for a UEFA Cup place with
Alessandro Bianchi's strike four minutes from time.
Brazilian Aldair's tenth-minute strike gave Roma the perfect start
against Juventus and further goals from Uruguay's Daniel Fonseca and
Argentina's Abel Balbo brought week-long celebrations of the first
Juventus title in nine years to an abrupt halt.
The victory earned Roma a UEFA Cup spot -- leaving Inter, Cagliari,
Napoli, Sampdoria, and Fiorentina to fight it out for the remaining
place.
Cagliari are level with Inter on 49 points but, with a visit to
Juventus on the final day of the season, may rue a surprise 1-0 defeat
at home to Napoli.
Lazio striker Giuseppe Signori, whose goals helped Foggia into Serie A
four years ago, condemned his old club to relegation with a stunning
free kick.
Brescia and Reggiana have long been doomed to relegation and, with
Foggia now certain to join them, Genoa and Padova -- the two clubs
fighting to avoid the fourth and last relegation spot -- drew 1-1.
Padova's Franco Gabrieli cancelled out Gennaro Ruotolo's goal for
Genoa, who finished the game with 10 men after Gianluca Francesconi was
dismissed. The result kept Genoa three points adrift of Padova with one
game remaining.
Cremonese completed their third successive win, 2-1 at Brescia, to
make sure of first division soccer next season, fighting back after
falling behind to a goal from Maurizio Neri.
At the San Siro, AC Milan lost 1-0 to Bari.

yesterday to demonstrate the brilliance of her latest discovery,
Designer Tramp. Funnell, who finished third and second at the previous
two runnings of the championship, continued her improvement with a win
on the talented six-year-old.
They led from start to finish, ending with a showjumping clear round
to follow Saturday's faultless cross-country. With nothing to add to her
dressage score of 43.4 points, Funnell finished 9.2 ahead of French
runner-up Didier Seguret on Newlot.

* GLOUCESTERSHIRE left-armer Mike Smith turned in the best bowling of
his career to send Worcestershire crashing to an innings-and-73-run
defeat in their Britannic Assurance Championship clash. Smith averaged a
wicket every other over during a 90-minute spell which brought him five
victims before finishing with a final return of six for 57 at
Gloucester.
Another bowler currently on-song is Hampshire's Zimbabwean Test star
Heath Streak, who claimed his best figures for the county to send Sussex
crashing to defeat by an innings and 106 runs at Portsmouth. Streak
finished with four for 81 as Sussex, who began the day on 143 for seven
in their first innings, were bowled out for 196 and 232 after having
being forced to follow on.
Off-spinner Adrian Pierson finished with match figures of eight for
111 as Leicestershire crushed Durham by an innings and 91 runs at Grace
Road.
Glamorgan failed by just two runs to win their third Championship game
of the season against Kent at Tunbridge Wells. Set 271 for victory, Tony
Cottey (85) and Matthew Maynard (73) took Glamorgan to the brink of
victory before England A spinner Min Patel struck with five for 99. They
needed two off the final ball but wicketkeeper Colin Metson was run out.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
THE ball hit legs rather than stumps with almost frightening
regularity, and at the end of the day, it was Perthshire who limped off
with bruised egos, if nothing else.
The umpires pointed a finger down the pitch seven times, and the bald
fact was that the men from Perth lost by eight wickets to West Lothian
in a rain-interupted match at Boghall -- one of only two games in the
Caley 80/- Scottish Counties to start, and the only one to be concluded.
The number of lbw decisions given was unusually high considering that
only 12 wickets fell, but Perthshire skipper Trevor Brown was in no
doubt where the blame for defeat lay.
''The batsmen let us down badly. We should have put a total on that
board which the bowlers could have defended. There's some application
needed, and practice in the nets. That will happen this week.''
Brown, vice-captain last year, added this warning to other sides:
''Don't write us off just because we finished in the bottom spot last
year. There is plenty of talent in this team, and we are perfectly
capable of gaining good results.''
The same skipper, however, certainly caused considerable surprise
among some sections of the Boghall aficionados. When Brown won the toss,
he elected to bat first, despite the fact that there had been heavy
overnight rain.
Those with raised eyebrows were taking into account last week's
matches, when, again following overnight rain, the sides who batted
first all lost.
Despite the excellent covers at the ground, the pitch was still damp,
and the visitors' final total of 71 all out suggested that Brown may
have made a mistake.
But he was adamant afterwards: ''It was the right decision at the
time. I don't regret having made it.''
However, he must have been having some dire thoughts as wickets
tumbled at 6, 6, 17, 19, 29, and 32 twice. Seven away, a slight revival
to 59 for eight, and then almost before they knew it, there were no more
batsmen to come in.
West Lothian skipper Steve Crawley seemed to be determined to overtake
that total all on his own.
The opener, with partner William Donald taking a back seat, hammered
seven 4s and a 6 in his quickfire 38 as the clouds gathered ominously
overhead.
The game already had been delayed for an hour at the start, and as
both Crawley and Donald were out lbw to Francis McGaffney and Lal Rajput
with the score on 44, there was quite a worried look about the place
soon after when, with only 17 runs required for victory, down came the
rain.
However, the smiles came out with the sun after a 20-minute stoppage,
and West Lothian recorded their first win of the season, reaching their
total of 74 in only 14 overs.
Skipper Crawley admitted afterwards: ''Before the start of the day, we
were bottom of the league, but it was an entirely false position. Of the
two defeats and a draw on our record, a total of 30 more runs could have
won us all three games.
''We had been taking too long to get going, around 15 overs with
either the bat or ball. Today, we got going straight away.''
Ian Beven, who arrived as professional at Boghall this year after a
successful spell with Grange, became a real Tasmanian devil with the
ball, finishing with figures of six for 24 in 16.4 overs. And with David
Orr weighing in at the other end with four for 29, it was little wonder
that Perthshire were out before they knew what had hit them.
The other match to get started was at Prestwick Oval. Ayrshire managed
144 for nine against champions Strathmore, with Drew Parsons hitting 39.
Steve Atkinson, however, put the brakes on with three for 11, and Mark
Kelaher supported him with three for 25.
Grant Lawrence with 35 and Willie Duthie unbeaten on 43 had Strathie
within 22 runs of victory at 123 for six when rain brought proceedings
to an end.
Cricket? In this weather, the game should be called frustration.

GREEK legislators have dealt out the heaviest sanctions ever on AEK
Athens and Panathinaikos for the rioting which took place during their
recent cup final.
AEK must play their first three games next season behind closed doors,
seven of their players have been suspended for that period, and two of
their officials banned from holding office for periods ranging up to six
months.
Panathinaikos must play two games without their supporters and their
president has been proscribed for three months.
* THE German FA has banished two more clubs from the Bundesliga to the
amateur ranks because of their rising debts.
Nuremburg and Hertha Berlin will join Dynamo Dresden and Saarbrucken
as a result of the purge to clean up their game, which is in line with
UEFA policy.
In France, Nice and Lille have been prohibited from buying any new
players until their finances have been put in order, and in Brazil,
Internacional have been demoted for failing to pay Espanol, of Uruguay,
for the Brazilian international Silas.
* CHILE have imposed a two-year suspension on Frank Lobos, one of
their players who took part in the recent World Under-20 tournament in
Qatar, for accepting a #3500 bribe to throw a match.
And in Singapore, Mizan Ulot, goalkeeper with Malaysia's Olympic team,
has been jailed for eight months for match-rigging.
* DIEGO Maradona's personal manager, Guillermo Coppola, said it was
80% certain that the Argentinian will join Santos, of Brazil, and reject
an offer to rejoin his former club, Boca Juniors.
* REAL Madrid fear the career of international midfielder Michel is
over after a long-term knee injury failed to respond to surgery.
* JAPAN clinched the Kirin Cup on goal difference over Scotland after
beating Ecuador 3-0 in Tokyo.
The hosts' victory came courtesy of a Masashi Nakayama strike after 36
minutes and two second-half penalties by Kazuyoshi Miura.
Japan and Scotland drew 0-0 draw in the first match, with Scotland
then going on to defeat Ecuador 2-1 in the second.
* COLIN Todd prepares to return to Wembley today predicting a great
future for Bolton prodigy Alan Stubbs.
Former England defender Todd, who is Bolton's assistant manager,
believes Stubbs is capable of making it all the way to the top as he
faces up to their first-division play-off final against Reading.
Stubbs, stretchered off in the semi-final victory over Wolves which
saw David Lee (broken foot) ruled out of today's match, has recovered
from his calf injury and Todd believes the play-off showdown could be
just the first of many big games Stubbs is set to encounter during his
career.
''He's had an excellent first couple of seasons. He's a thoroughbred
and in my opinion he'll go the whole way to the top. He plays with
thought, he has two good feet and he can read the game well. So we're
pleased he's available for this crucial game.''
Todd is confident the Burnden Park outfit's experience from their
Coca-Cola Cup final defeat against Liverpool under the twin towers will
come in useful.
''We know what it's all about. We've experienced the atmosphere, the
big pitch and a final in playing Liverpool. We know we've got to keep
hold of the ball,'' he explained.

THE record-sized Rover Series fleet were breaking new records -- for
gear failure -- over the weekend's two wind-buffeted races.
Ten boats lost their masts or booms, dozens of sails were shredded,
and two major crashes spelled a premature end to the five-day regatta
for many and a goldmine for the riggers and sailmakers.
After three races there are just three crews with unbeaten scorelines.
Geoffrey Howison's Local Hero X has scarcely put a foot wrong throughout
the weekend. Although they had to work hard on Saturday's Olympic
Triangle, when the southerly breeze was less steady -- between 12 and 20
knots -- they held off Chris Bonar's Tripp 40 Bateleur by just 14
seconds.
Yesterday, when the wind topped over 35 knots with ink blot squalls
scudding down Loch Fyne to wreak havoc and force the cancellation of the
Sportboat class race -- Local Hero was more than five minutes clear of
Bateleur, who lost time when they lost control of their spinnaker.
Both of the two other skippers with winning hat tricks are sailmakers.
Steve Goacher, 1993 Rover Trophy winner and UK Sonata champion, has
again proved his superior speed and tactics and looks set to dominate
the class for the third consecutive year.
Last year Irvine-based sailmaker John Highcock blotted his copybook
just once to break an otherwise perfect score. Steering the same Moody
336 Crusader, he is this year back on course to win Class 5 overall with
three convincing wins to his credit.
In the Sigma 33 class, John and Hilary Connelly lead with two firsts
and a second place, but yesterday were gifted the lead by Race 1 winner
Jon Fitzgerald, who relinquished his three-minute cushion when he lost
track of the windward buoy and sailed too far and had to double back.

MANY thanks indeed to Jim Reynolds for the very positive article in
The Herald recently.
Together with the football authorities, The National Stadium Committee
is genuinely committed to rebuilding the national stadium.
The ambition is to provide for the Scottish spectators conditions of
safety and comfort comparable with anything in Europe, and also to allow
the Scottish Football Association to attract major European and world
tournaments and finals to Scotland.
The economic impact would be considerable.

THE Great Scottish Run, or realistically, the Glasgow Half-Marathon,
is a rip-off in respect of entry fee. The fee of #9 is half to a third
more than any other similar Scottish event, where extra inducements and
rewards are also offered.
I write this as I was introduced, via the Glasgow Marathon, to the
Scottish Veteran Harriers. My life has been enriched socially,
competitively, and recreationally. But #9? No.

A SMALL incident but one, I am told, tends to be repeated throughout
the year.
The setting -- the East of Scotland Junior Tennis Championships held
on the rubble-banked outer courts of the new showpiece Craiglockhart
Tennis Centre on Saturday, May 20.
The incident -- after about two games of the boys' under-14 doubles
final, the track-suited and fleece-jacketed referee intervened to inform
the young players, and the Barbour-wrapped umpire, that the participants
should not be playing in track-suit bottoms.
Had they wanted to do so, they should have sought her permission in
advance. Despite having hung around for over an hour on an unseasonably
cold and windy afternoon, it was necessary for the boys to comply with
this diktat.
Unfortunately, one of them had to borrow a pair of shorts and with
some embarrassment changed into them in front of the small collection of
onlookers and parents.
What was achieved by this display of bureaucratic officiousness, I am
at a loss to understand.
Sports fans will be aware that Britain now languishes in
God-knows-what qualifying division of the Davis Cup after having lost a
match to Slovakia, or was it Slovenia?
They also won't need reminding that it is close on 60 years since we
produced a truly world-class player. I wonder if there is any connection
between this and the oh-so-typical attitude displayed by the officials
at Craiglockhart.

I WAS interested to read the report of the Dunfermline-Airdrie match
as published in the Herald Sport. What really caught my attention were
the comments made regarding the referee, and the striking similarity
between this official's performance and that of the official, whom it
appears shall be nameless, who was in charge of the much over-publicised
Scottish Junior Cup match between Dalry Thistle and Whitburn, as all of
these comments would have been applicable on that occasion.
To quote your reporter: ''Fussy? He displays more cards than

COLIN Montgomerie has been told by skeletal David Leadbetter to cut
down on the calories if he wants to reach the pinnacle of the
professional game. David Feherty, who nicknamed the Scot ''Mrs
Doubtfire'', also has been out of form recently.
The top golf professionals may have their share of problems, but they
also have a host of gurus and advisers -- from psychologists and
dieticians to doctors and astrologers -- to guide them.
Many take friends on tour to relieve boredom. Ian Woosnam, who missed
the cut in the Volvo PGA championship at Wentworth on Saturday, had his
private plane waiting to jet him away. Ian Botham often joins him on
tour. That may not necessarily be a bonus. Legendary sore heads have
been the result.
But it's all a long way from the lifestyle of the average Scottish
club professional.
Golf is only the starting point, and they require a myriad of other
talents and skills -- as a teacher, a manager, a shopkeeper, and an
accountant.
No matter how good a teacher they become, it is often an impossible
task when dealing with the congenitally uncoordinated. Some never manage
it. At one West of Scotland club, the professional was not renowned for
his coaching ability. Members rushed from the practice area exclaiming
that he tried to put them into positions that he could not mould into
Plasticine.
The club pro also needs to have good management skills. This is
essential, as keeping the members happy often requires a PhD in the
subject. An ability to bite one's tongue often helps.
On top of this, there is the running of a shop, helping with the
assistants, filling in the accounts, and organising the tee times.
Little wonder the actual golf sometimes fall downs the priority list.
Gordon Niven, who has been the professional at Bothwell Castle near
Glasgow for the past year, is typical. As a boy, he was keen to be a
footballer but following an injury, he switched to golf at 15. By 18, he
was an assistant professional at Buchanan Castle, and working from
7.30am until 9pm six days a week.
Niven practised at lunch-time and after work. Luckily, in the evening,
the practice area was beside the shop, because had to leave the outside
light on to see what he was hitting. He was earning #42 a week and
spending #30 of it on petrol -- a far cry from the Lear jets and
five-star hotels.
The dilemma that all young professionals face, he says, is that to
reach the top they have to play and to practise all the time, while the
job itself makes so many other demands on their time.
In 1986, Niven moved to Turnberry and, looking back, he says this was
the time when he decided to opt for becoming a club pro rather than a
full-time tour player. He was at Turnberry when Greg Norman won the Open
there, but remembers most the upper-body physique of Arnold Palmer.
''He would almost crush your hand when he shook it,'' he recalls.
A move to Belgium followed in 1990, and until he came back to
Scotland, his time was taken up with coaching rather than playing.
But Niven still hankers after the big-time. He had a taste of it as a
teenager when he was able to pre-qualify for European Tour events. He
made his way through in the Dutch, Madrid, and Portuguese Opens, playing
with Canizares and Garrido. He even had a hole-in-one at the Dutch.
Now he plays on the Tartan Tour, but earlier this month he failed for
the first time to qualify for the Scottish PGA at Dalmahoy.
At 31 he feels his game as reached a crossroads. ''I still want to be
in the top 25, but to do that I must make the cut in seven tour
events,'' he says.
This will allow him to pre-qualify next year and in many respects the
pressure would be less. ''I could then choose the events to play in and
the pro-ams, and hopefully make more money and still be improving my
standard.''
In the meantime, he juggles his time between repairing members' clubs,
dealing with sales reps, and coaching the youngsters at his club.
''But I would still like to be known as a good player rather than
someone who sells Mars Bars and puts up the club flag every day.''
If Leadbetter's advice is sound, perhaps Colin Montgomerie should not
call in at the shop on his way out to the course every day.

LEN Lungo is now nine clear in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship after Jefferby's six-length victory in the Shire Handicap
Hurdle on Saturday at Hexham.
It gave the Carrutherstown trainer his twenty-seventh winner of the
season, equalling his 1994 total.
Jefferby, ridden by Scottish conditional jockey Fraser Perratt, was
having his first run for Lungo. He was previously trained by Jeremy
Glover at Worksop, but had not won since 1991-92. Glover suggested the
eight-year-old needed a change of scenery and recommended he be sent to
the Hetlandhill yard.
Miss Enrico, who had won four consecutive point-to-points for Kevin
Anderson, helping to assure his sixth Northern Area championship, took
the Flying Ace Hunter Chase, giving Lucinda Russell of Milnathort, Fife,
her first success under rules.
Gortnamona, third to Rawaan at Perth 12 days ago, came good for
Jedburgh permit-holder Rob Bewley when, under Jason Callaghan, he won
the MD Foods Novices Chase.
A report has gone to the Jockey Club on why Timanfaya, the 4-1 second
favourite, owned by Mrs Gwen Culham of Dumfries, was left at the start
in the Summerrods Handicap Chase. He was facing the wrong way when the
tapes went up and did not race.
At Cartmel, Ken Oliver had his fifth winner of the season, his best
total for six years, with T O O Mamma's in the Carling Premiership
Novices Hurdle.
* LAST year's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes winner
King's Theatre finished third on his American debut yesterday.
The colt was beaten just over three lengths by Correntino in an
allowance race over an extended mile at Belmont Park in New York.

DICK Hern was yesterday hopeful that Harayir will bounce back quickly
from her disappointing effort in Saturday's Irish 1000 Guineas. She
could finish only fifth behind Ridgewood Pearl, having been sent off
11-10 favourite to follow up her 1000 Guineas Newmarket victory at the
Curragh.
But Hern hopes to gain revenge on the winner in a possible rematch at
Royal Ascot next month. He has given Harayir a clean bill of health and
blames soft ground for her defeat.
''Obviously, I am disappointed but she has come out of the race very
well and I hope she will be able to go for the Coronation Stakes at
Royal Ascot if the ground is all right,'' Hern said.
''I was probably too confident that she would handle the going
yesterday -- her grand-dam Give Thanks loved it.
''When we arrived at The Curragh, the ground was still good but then
we got heavy rain for a couple of hours and that made all the
difference.''
John Oxx also nominated the Coronation Stakes as a likely target for
Ridgewood Pearl, whose four-length triumph yesterday gave the trainer
his first success in the race and provided the first home winner of the
Irish 1000 Guineas since 1991.
Always close to the pace set by stable companion and eventual third
Khaytada, Ridgewood Pearl was sent to the front two furlongs out by
Christy Roche and Harayir threatened only briefly.
''It was a race that my father was often placed in before, but somehow
it eluded him. Ridgewood Pearl has put the record straight for us and it
was nice to see her do it in style,'' said Oxx.
''I always thought she was the best of our fillies, and she confirmed
that impression for me when I sat up on her for the first time this year
on Thursday morning. But I couldn't believe how easily she won here
today,'' enthused Roche.
While Harayir faded and was caught for fourth place by the lone French
raider Ghostly, her compatriot Warning Shadows fared rather better on
behalf of Clive Brittain.
Although Ridgewood Pearl had gone clear and was never in danger,
Michael Kinane got a ready response from Warning Shadows, who went past
Khaytada in the last furlong to claim the #30,000 runner-up prize.
''She ran on really well and it was worth the expense. She had been
held up in her work before running second at Newmarket, and it looks now
as though she will stay further than a mile,'' said Brittain.

FIVE of the first eight home in Newmarket's Palace House Stakes make
up the field for today's Tripleprint Temple Stakes at Sandown, writes
White and Gold.
Although Mind Games landed the race at headquarters, Jack Berry's
charge will do well to hold off the challenge of third-placed Owington.
Three arguments weigh heavily in Owington's favour. One is the Esher
track. Every yard is against the collar and this is more likely to suit
the better stamina of Owington.
Secondly, Owington was in desperate need of the outing at Newmarket
and that, allied to the fact that he had to overcome trouble in running,
points to a victory for Geoff Wragg's runner.
Although the remainder of the field are no slouches either, Owington
is the confident tip.
Julie Cecil looks to have a more than useful handicapper on her hands
in Forest Cat and she can continue her progress by landing the Bonuspost
Fillies' Handicap.

WHILE supporters of one Glasgow sporting institution were celebrating
their re-acquaintance with silverware at Hampden on Saturday, a match
which could have given a realistic guide to the prospects of two of the
city's leading cricket clubs ending their own particular trophy wait was
frustratingly abandoned.
Just down the road from Hampden, at Titwood, Clydesdale took on Poloc.
The home side have been separated from the Western Union title since
1980, while the men from Shawholm have not won the competition since
1985.
Occupying the leading two places in the table going into their fixture
on Saturday, an intriguing contest was inevitable.
Sadly, all that transpired was one of those on-off affairs in which
Scottish cricket specialises because of the weather.
A brief halt was called with one ball left in the opening over of the
Clydesdale innings, but the afternoon brightened and for a while it
looked as if a decisive result might be achieved.
Poloc skipper Brian Spence struck a blow for his side by catching
Donald Orr at slip off the bowling of Ian Holten to end the opening
stand, but that merely brought Aamir Hanif to the crease. In tandem with
Greig Williamson, he set about the bowling.
Williamson began slowly, but by the end of the home innings he had
compiled a century -- which included eight boundaries from 134 balls in
185 minutes.
At the other end, Hanif was heading for yet another Union century, but
he ran out of time in his supporting role and finished unbeaten on 95.
Poloc lost Charlie McBride to a brilliant caught-and-bowled by Alan
Burgess, who also accounted for the other opener when he had David Nairn
snapped up by Donald Orr. At 62 for two came the next stoppage, and
after another couple of attempts to beat the gathering clouds, it was
all over, with Poloc standing at 71 for three.
Elsewhere, the weather was similarly disappointing, and with none of
the matches completed, the league table remains unaltered.
At Hamilton Crescent, West of Scotland compiled a respectable 218 for
six against Greenock, but with the visitors bogged down on 66 for three
in response, the elements decided.
The Ayrshire derby also finished early, but there was sufficient play
for Bruce Patterson to exhibit a welcome return to form. In exile from
the national team after a pre-season mix-up which caused him to miss a
training weekend, the Scottish internationalist punished the Kilmarnock
bowling at Cambusdoon.
Patterson eventually went for 123 out of the Ayr total of 226 for
five. Like most teams batting second on Saturday, Kilmarnock struggled
as the conditions began to deteriorate. The end came with the Kirkstyle
side on 70 for three and although Asif Mujtaba, the Pakistani Test
player, was unbeaten on 32 at the time, the defending champions were
probably less happy than Kilmarnock about the outcome.
Ferguslie proved the exception to teams who batted first making
sizeable totals when they played host to Paisley rivals Kelburne at
Meikleriggs. With only 140 to chase for victory, Kelburne were set fair
on 28-0 when proceedings were halted by the weather.
At Bothwell Castle Policies, Uddingston and Drumpellier suffered the
most frustrating afternoon of all, with the match declared a no-result
after 97 overs had been bowled.
''A bit of a waste of time,'' as one participant put it afterwards.
The visitors took the crease and made 226 for seven, with Stevie
Allison the top scorer on 56. Uddingston's innings was dominated again
by another excellent century by George Reifer.
He finished unbeaten on 104, but after interruptions had caused the
possibility of a draw to be ruled out, only outright victory for either
side would have made a result.
Accordingly, with the number-of-overs-lost factor making the only
feasible result a win for Drumpellier, the visiting team were anxious to
keep going as far as they could.
Play continued until Uddingston had reached 186 for seven, at which
stage common sense prevailed and the teams came off.

WHERE is the logic in the argument that the quality of Scottish
football will be enhanced by expanding the premier division to 12, 14,
16 or 18 clubs? That would mean admitting to the top division two, four,
six, or eight sides who are even worse than Partick Thistle.
How will lowering the standard improve the quality?
The premier division is not too cut-throat. The whole point of
competition is that there will be winners and losers. An expansion of
the premier division would achieve nothing, but create an enlarged
safety zone for also-rans.
How will that improve quality?
It is often argued that the top clubs in the first division are
''really'' premier-division sides, but does the evidence support that?
Raith Rovers were promoted as runaway champions of the first division
in 1992-93, but finished a distant eleventh out of 12 in the 1993-94
premier division.
Dunfermline have not played in the premier division since 1991-92,
when they won four games from 44 attempts.
How would an expansion of the premier division to include clubs
performing at these levels improve quality?
The wrong problem has been identified, so inappropriate solutions are
being proposed. The real problem is not with the premier division, but
rather with the first division.
It concerns negative perceptions of the value of that division. The
clubs themselves, ably abetted by journalists and pundits, are their own
worst enemies in creating and fostering these perceptions.
In what way would a game between Dundee and Dundee United be better if
played as a bottom half of an enlarged premier division match than as a
decisive match in competition for promotion from the first division? Why
should that match be regarded as inherently and significantly inferior
to a premier-division game between, say, Partick Thistle and Hearts?
The answer to the real problem is to find ways to present the first
division positively and create interest in it so that relegation from
the premier division is not regarded as the disaster which it is now
seen as. The first division is a worthwhile competition in its own
right.
Of course, it may just be that the clubs which regularly shuttle
between the premier and first divisions are less interested in the
quality of Scottish football than in protecting or obtaining big
pay-days from visits by certain well-supported clubs.

TEXACO TROPHY
ENGLAND'S much maligned cricketers drew first blood in this summer's
jousting with the West Indies by winning the third one-day international
at Lord's by 73 runs yesterday, and with it the Texaco Trophy.
It immediately should be added that they have done so on the two
previous West Indies tours, without managing to add the infinitely more
important Wisden Trophy.
But in these three meetings of the two countries drubbed by Australia
last winter, England have boosted their confidence, found a new bowler
in Lancashire's Peter Martin, and confirmed that the tourists no longer
carry an aura of invincibility with them.
The West Indies target of 277 was an unexpectedly high one, given
England's early struggle against Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop on a damp
morning.
Mike Atherton kept his head and his wicket in compiling an outstanding
127 -- his first century in a one day international -- and the
fourth-wicket partnership of 92 off 75 balls that he shared with Mark
Ramprakash turned out to be the game's decisive one.
It was not a difficult decision in the circumstances for Scotland's
Mike Denness to name Atherton man of the match. In winning England's man
of the series award as well, the captain collected a total of #2250 --
more than he was fined following last summer's infamous ''dirt in the
pocket'' incident.
The West Indies needed someone to play an innings of equal authority,
but lost a wicket, and consequently momentum, each time they looked like
opening up. Brian Lara, still the most prized catch of all, fell for 11
to keeper Alec Stewart's dive, and Carl Hooper, forced to open these
days, went for 40 also off the bowling of Dominic Cork, just as he was
beginning to force the pace.
Yorkshire's Darren Gough, the new England folk hero, had Keith
Arthurton caught behind and left skipper Richie Richardson still looking
for a decent score by trapping him leg before.
Martin deservedly weighed in with two wickets before Angus Fraser, on
his home ground, sliced through the tail with a spell of three for four
in six balls.
For a time it had seemed that, like so many recent one-day cup finals
at Lord's, this would be another game decided by the toss, with one side
forced to bat in treacherous conditions early on.
It was Richardson's good fortune to call correctly for the third
successive occasion and to let his bowlers loose after a 15-minute delay
for rain on a pitch so lively that the first five overs brought only two
scoring strokes.
Both were 4s to Stewart, who in the next over, fenced Ian Bishop to
Lara low at slip. Atherton took 27 balls to get off the mark, yet from
an unpromsing 19 for one off 10 overs, with Ambrose spitting fire,
England prospered.
As the outfield dried and Ambrose and Bishop took a break, the batsmen
settled against the far less potent Winston Benjamin and Ottis Gibson.
Graeme Hick (with 24) Graham Thorpe (28) and Ramprakash (29 not out)
offered just enough support to their captain, who improved upon his
previous best in one day internationals for the second successive
occasion, following his 92 in England's win at The Oval on Friday.
Long before miscuing Gibson to mid-off from a ball that sat up, he had
changed the shape of the innings and put his team in with a shout.
Alan Wells of Sussex, previously seen by some as a stalking horse for
the captaincy should Ray Illingworth lose faith in Atherton, belted 15
off his first 10 balls in international cricket and Gough smashed
Benjamin square for 6 before losing his middle stump to him.
West Indies, as so often in the past, handicapped themselves by
bowling 19 no balls and wides, allowing England the equivalent of three
extra overs. It always seemed likely that they would prove costly.
Now for the real thing, starting at Leeds on Thursday week. If the
Test series is as absorbing as this three match prelude, it will be a
memorable summer.

MELANIE Neef hopes she can retain the form which won her the UK
Inter-county 200 metres title at Bedford yesterday so that she can
reproduce it next week when her father will see her race for the first
time, writes Doug Gillon.
Running in the sixty-first year of these championships, but the first
in which women's competition has been integrated, Neef clocked 24.14sec
to beat a line-up which included several of Britain's recognised 200m
sprinters, including Olympic relay medallist Simone Jacobs.
Neef, European and Commonwealth finalist last year over 400m, is due
to race over that distance in Nuremberg a week tomorrow. ''I last saw my
dad when I was about seven, although we talk regularly on the phone,''
said Mel, who rewrote the Scottish indoor record books over the winter.
The former Rangers goalkeeper, Gerry Neef, now coaching women's
football in Germany, has seen his daughter race only on TV.
Neef, who also races the 100m today, was one of three Scottish title
winners during windy but dry conditions at yesterday's opening session.
National record-holder Ken Campbell took the 110m hurdles in 14.20,
being followed across the line in third by 17-year-old Ross Baillie,
while Lorna Jackson won the women's javelin (52.08 metres), with another
17-year-old, Joanne Walker, adding three metres to her lifetime best to
take bronze.
Edinburgh Southern's Campbell, sixth in the Commonwealth final in
Victoria, clocked a legal 14.06 in the heats, while Baillie lowered his
personal best in heats and final, finishing third with 14.56.
Jackson, from Edinburgh Woollen Mill, justified her selection for the
British under-23 team next weekend in Basle, with no other competitor
reaching 50 metres.
A disappointment of the women's sprints was the withdrawal of Aileen
McGillivary, suffering from a stomach bug.
Karen Skeggs, the national triple jump champion and record-holder,
competing for Kent, failed by just two centimetres to claim a fourth
title for Scotland, reaching 12.09m. And in the high jump, Lisa Brown,
from Glenrothes, finished third equal with 1.75m.
Jean Clark, competing for Buckinghamshire, was fourth (47.52m), though
well short of her national record of 48.98m in the women's hammer.
The only championship record of the day came in the pole vault. After
a six-and-a-half-hour contest Neil Winter, the Commonwealth champion,
cleared 5.50m. Title-winners and Scottish performances:

YVONNE Murray is adopting the Nelson approach to her one-second defeat
by Olympic champion Derartu Tulu beside the Victory.
Whether this amounts to blind faith in her own ability, or simply the
admirable Nelsonian virtue of refusing to acknowledge hardships ahead,
remains to be seen.
Ethiopian Tulu is currently likely to feature as Murray's hottest
rival for the world 10,000 metres track title later this year, and when
the pair met for the first time at the BUPA 5000m international road
race in Portsmouth on Saturday, Murray's first race in eight months,
Tulu edged home in 15min 38sec.
Tulu, who won the world cross-country title at Durham in March, and
already race-sharp this summer, was under full sail in the final 300m.
She got the jump on Murray, sprinting clear after rounding the last of
repeated, too-sharp bends.
As usual, athletes' needs were sacrificed to the occasion -- a
nondescript route past Nelson's flagship and a dockyard about to
celebrate its quincentenary.
Indeed, so tight were the bends that Paul Tergat, the Kenyan men's
world cross-country champion, fell, damaging hands, right knee, and
stomach. He lost 15 metres, yet still got up to make a race of it with
Essex man Rob Denmark, who won the men's event (13-39) by one second.
Commonwealth champion Murray believed she could outsprint Tulu. ''Your
brain tells the legs to sprint, but they have forgotten what to do,''
she said. ''Tulu is race-fit, and I'm not. But I am not one to avoid
people.
''It was important to run beside her, weigh her up, feel her strength.
I am not worried. By the worlds, I will have done a lot of sprint work.
I hope to have done many shorter races by then, including at least one
1500m against Tulu. That way I will learn more.''
It is hard to envisage the tiny Tulu, a major in her country's prison
service, in the role of Cell Block H's Joan Ferguson. But the former
shepherdess is a martinet when it comes to pushing herself in races, or
her country's officials, to get what she wants.
Tulu collected #500 for her Portsmouth success, but has yet to see her
prize-money for winning the world cross-country when last time she was
in England at Durham. ''I assume the money went to the federation -- I
haven't seen it myself,'' she confessed.
Despite the fact that three of her team-mates sought political asylum
then, Tulu insists: ''I love my country and would rather stay at home,
whatever the problems.''
However, that has not stopped her leading a revolt against her
federation. She revealed that she headed a protest march on the streets
of the capital, Addis Ababa, which brought about the sacking of the
entire federation committee who had caused them to travel with
inadequate funds and tickets.
''We gave the Government a choice: either scrap the sport altogether,
or start to treat us properly. They asked us whom we wished appointed,
and we gave them a list of names.''
Such a solution would probably appeal to Denmark. Though England may
expect their Commonwealth 5000m champion to line up in the Europa Cup
next month, Denmark insists he does not see that as his duty.
''I don't want to cause controversy, but you can run only so many
5000s,'' said Denmark. ''To talk about me being mercenary is nonsense. I
took silver in the Europeans, gold in Victoria, and ran the World Cup.
You can't be in shape now, and in August . . . but I know I'll get some
phone calls, once they (the UK selectors) see this and remember who I am
again.''
The men's mile, run at a modest pace, was won in 4-03 by Croation
Branko Zorko, who in the past two indoor seasons has medalled at the
world and European championships without being good enough to beat
Scotland's David Strang. Details:
Men. Mile: B Zorko (Croatia) 4-03; 2, G Chirchir (Kenya) 4-04; 3, M
Barnes (Enfield). 5000m: R Denmark (Basildon) 13-39; 2, P Tergat (Kenya)

IN JUST over two weeks' time, West Indies play Scotland at the Grange
in Edinburgh. If the wicket then is as lively as the one on which the
match against Edinburgh Academicals was contested on Saturday, expect
fireworks from Messrs Ambrose, Walsh, and Bishop.
It was greatly to the liking of Graham Hurlbatt, who tormented the
life out of the Accies batsmen with figures of seven for 43.
Pete Steindl engineered the initial breakthrough with the first two
victims at a cost of only two runs. Accies rallied as Kiwi Craig Symons
dug in for a half-century before Hurlbatt removed him lbw. It was all
downhill after that as 77 for four fell to 105 all out.
It was essential that Edinburgh put Grange under immediate pressure.
However, they dropped their catches as Gordon McGurk and Roddy Smith put
the innings on a solid basis. Indeed, the later stages were enlivened
more by the possibility of rain arriving before Grange reached the
target.
Stenhousemuir also navigated a winning course, at Barnton, where their
match with Royal High finished in dire conditions. Full marks to High,
who were set a daunting target, with Iain Philip again in prolific form,
a century eluding him when Stewart Farquharson ran him out on 93. He and
John Bell (68) shared a big opening partnership, the foundation for a
total of 225 for seven.
Skipper Abdul Rehman, with his second successive league 50, and pro
Manzoor Elahi provided the home side with a splendid start in reply,
they too recording a century opening stand. But their colleagues could
not capitalise as Douglas Zuill and Graham Gardner whittled them out
with little substantial resistance.
Carlton, also title aspirants, enjoyed a fairly comfortable home
victory over Falkland. Manoj Parmar scored 89 for the Fifers, more than
half their total, while Robin Singh claimed five of their wickets. Bryn
Lockie, who had a century for Edinburgh last weekend, continued in
similar vein and was still there on 65 at the finish. Jim Govan
partnered him through the spine of the innings, his contribution 46.
It was important for these winners that they maintained their
challenge, since Ryden League leaders Heriot's fixture at Freuchie, was
off.
Watsonians were held to a draw by Corstorphine at Union Park, the home
side's Dean Sutherland hitting a half-century for the second Saturday in
a row.

TOM Scott stretches to 6ft 6in, and he weighs 400lb. Only a fool would
not take someone that size seriously. Yet Scott and more than 40 other
imposing Americans have an image problem.
Scotland, a country which could not be said to be averse to aggressive
sports, so far has not yet taken the monoliths from the world of
gridiron to heart.
Perhaps the reluctance stems from a jolt to the sporting psyche. The
traditional sporting heroes in these parts were little, wiry men with
weather-beaten faces and hands and lily-white bodies.
Scottish sports fans could not go along to Murrayfield and a Scottish
Claymores match and shout ''gaun yersel, wee man,'' to Tom Scott, who
makes the former Chicago Bear William ''The Refrigerator'' Perry look
like a coolbag. Then again, maybe they could. After all, some of them
used to call Jim Denny ''Pele'' and that sharp sense of the outrageous
might be essential equipment for watching the World League of American
Football.
Scott, a guard and tackle who rarely travels more than 15 yards in one
go and whose job is to knock opponents over, might take some getting
used to, but he and his team-mates are certainly different. That alone
should give them an advantage in the sporting field, where so many
spectators have grown weary of the same old offerings.
The National Football League, having reached saturation point in their
own vast country, are trying to extend their boundaries by reaching into
Europe, and the Claymores, who play out of Murrayfield, are one of six
teams who have been given four years to chisel out a foothold in the
Continent's sporting calendar.
The NFL in partnership with Rupert Murdoch through Fox, his
international entertainment company, have pledged $44m over that period,
and each of the six clubs received $1m of backing this season. Currently
the Claymores claim to have averaged 10,000 fans over their four home
matches, and while that forms the nucleus of a support, the figure will
have to be significantly higher if the Edinburgh-based side want to
remain in play at the turn of the century.
It would also help considerably if the Claymores were to start
winning. Thery have lost seven of their eight games to date and their
fans have yet to see them win at home. Their latest defeat arrived on
Saturday night when the Barcelona Dragons beat them 16-13 in Edinburgh.
''I don't think 10,000 (crowds) will be enough to keep us going after
four years,'' said Sandy Waters, who as general manager runs the
Claymores operation. ''I think we have done well in such a short period
of time, but what we have to see is kids out in the field throwing our
kind of ball around and wearing the shirts of their favourite World
League teams.''
The Claymores intend to push an interest in schools, and during the
off-season, they hope to set up clinics with their coaches. It won't be
easy, of course, but the Claymores are prepared to try because they know
that today's kids are the players and spectators of tomorrow, a truth
which the traditional sports of football and rugby misplaced for a long
time.
If the Claymores are serious about being taken seriously, football and
rugby will have a degree of competition. ''We are new and we are
offering the kids something different,'' said Waters, who was born and
lived in St Andrews until he was 14, then moved to the San Francisco
area with his parents.
It was inevitable that rugby would take a close look at the Claymores
if only because they are renting the SRU's stadium, but Jim Telfer,
Scotland's director of rugby, has had talks with the Americans who have
taken up residence in an office in Edinburgh's West End, and he will be
seeking more information when he returns from the Rugby World Cup in
South Africa.
Telfer is considering the possibility of going to America to study the
methods of one of the NFL's major gridiron sides, and is said to be
particularly interested in the extensive use of video in that sport. The
Claymores, for instance, film training sessions and matches, and spend
many hours discussing and analysing the pictures. Errors, no matter how
seemingly insignificant, are replayed and talked about, with Waters
pointing out: ''It is a process of continual correction. We hear it, see
it, do it, and then review it.''
It is this philosophy which interests Telfer and, if he is taking the
world league seriously, it might be time more of us had a look also, and
other sports, perhaps even football, should take notice.
There might also be something for them in the way the world league pay
players. Salaries are capped and paid out of the $1m each club receives,
with quarterbacks, who are the equivalent of football's midfield
schemers, being paid $20,000 and other players $15,000 each. Punters and
kickers get $10,000 each. The idea is to cap the salaries until the
sport takes off, by which time clubs would hope to have their own
individual sponsors and might be able to offer more attractive terms.
Director of public relations Wil Wilson said: ''As well as the
salaries, the clubs also pay for their players' accommodation and
food.''
The players are mainly drawn from American college teams although five
-- Lee Williamson (Houston Oilers), Matt Blundin (Kansas City Chiefs),
Jocelyn Borgella (Detroit Lions), Allen DeGraffenreid (Kansas City
Chiefs), and Darrell Mitchell (New Orleans Saints) -- are farmed out
from the National Football League where they have been waiting their
time to make an impact. By playing in the World League, these players
can gain greater match awareness and experience which might help them
advance their careers at the top level.
At the end of the 10-game season, the squad is disbanded and the
players head off back to America where they will continue to work with
college teams or at other jobs. Most of them will be invited back next
season, although the Claymores will be looking to improve their
standards, which might help them attract more fans.
No matter the sport, the world loves a winner and the Claymores'
record hardly sets pulses racing, even if Waters and his people believe
the results are not a true reflection of the team's ability. Naturally,
they claim next season will be better, and that they will be equipped to
tackle Amsterdam Admirals, Rhein Fire, London Monarchs, Frankfurt
Galaxy, and Barcelona Dragons on a more equal footing.
''We have done not too badly in terms of creating interest, but we can
do better. We don't think we will compete with football and rugby in
Scotland, but we can have a place here,'' said Wilson, a literature
graduate who was a staff writer during the congressional campaign of
Oliver Luck, a republican lawyer who ran for Federal Office in the state
of West Virginia.
''He lost narrowly, but then moved on to become general manager of
Frankfurt, and I went with him,'' Wilson added. ''Now I'm in Edinburgh
and I want people to know we are serious about the Claymores, and that
we intend bringing more youngsters to the games because they are the
future of any sport. If we can succeed with them, we have a chance, but
everyone involved has to be realistic.''
If the world league is a success, the NFL would have another vibrant
and competitive breeding ground, and Murdoch would benefit through
television rights, but that is of no real significance. Sport would be
the real winner and if the Claymores can improve and attract a larger
audience, Scotland, too, would win.
However, American football faces many of the problems which are
hampering the full development of soccer in the USA, where even the
memory of the World Cup finals is fading fast. Any sport which does not
have a root base faces an almost impossible task, but Waters, Wilson,
and players like Scott are intent on trying.
The world loves a trier.

SCOTTISH girls' indoor long-jump champion Jill Barrett (Westfield)
recorded a double in the Aberdeen District Schools championships at
Chris Anderson Stadium. She won her speciality in the senior age group
and also took the 800 metres. Ryan Murison (Quarryhill) won both the
100m and shot-putt titles. Bruce Crawford (Tyrie) and Stuart Forbes
(Robert Gordon's) were also double winners.
* GEORGE Patience from Tain won the overall Heavies championship at
Blackford Highland Games with 29 points. Bruce Aitken (Glenbervie) was
second (20) and Steven Aitken (Taynuilt) and Mark McDonald (Dumfries)
were third equal with 17[1/2] each.
Moffat Builders won the Scottish Tug o' War Championship, defeating
Mount Blair in the final.
* RED Star AC's Ross Low and Karen Lewis dominated the wheelchair
races at the Scottish championships for the Disabled at Glenrothes. Low
swept the board in the track events, winning every title from 200m to
5000m, while Lewis won four races in the women's championship.
Janice Lawton (Red Star) set a cerebral palsy world record for the
discus with 19.22m. Caroline Innes (Dundee), Richie Collins and Janice
Lawton (both Red Star), and Graham Robertson (Kirkintilloch) all won
titles with performances that bettered the qualifying standard for next
year's Paralympic Games in Atlanta.
* DOUBLE world duathlon champion Raymond Johnston recorded his fourth
win in the past five weeks when outclassing his rivals in the 24-mile
duathlon over his home course in the hills above East Kilbride.
Scottish triathlon champion Fiona Lothian had a winning margin of
almost eight minutes in the women's race. Results (run 3 miles, cycle 18
miles, run 3 miles):
1, R Johnston (East Kilbride) 1hr 19min 11sec (run 15-44, cycle 45-44,

DRUMPELLIER defeated Grange on the opening day of the Whyte &amp; Mackay
Scottish Cup and yesterday took a big step towards qualifying for the
knock-out stages when they hammered out an 86-run home win over East
League leaders, Heriot's.
Their hero was professional Saleem Sajjad who, coming in at 38 for
two, hammered no fewer than nine 6s in his knock of 112! Also striking
three 4s, he was sixth out at 211 in the forty-ninth over and Drumps saw
their final total up to 236 for seven.
Sajjad then removed Heriot's opener, Steven Thomson and when Billy
McPate accounted for Ian MacKinlay, the visitors were 4-2 in the seventh
over. When Heriot's threatened to come back, a glorious
caught-and-bowled by Anjum Aslam accounted for Jim Love as he was
getting into his stride. Heriot's finally petered out on 150 for seven.
Ferguslie also remain unbeaten thanks to a five-wicket win at
Dumfries. Only Trevor Williams got runs as Dumfries reached 153 for
nine, with both Stewart Kennedy and David Arnott each taking three
wickets. Any furrows on the Ferguslie brow at 53 for three were erased
by a fourth-wicket stand of 89 by Mark Pawson (59) and Sandy Strang (21
not out).
West of Scotland are also on target to win their group thanks to an
eight-wicket triumph at East Kilbride, who built on an opening stand of
44 from Kenny Badcock and Jim Hampson to set a target of 169 for eight.
West openers Alistair Storie and Mark Harper in turn opened with 102 to
send West on their way to victory.
Despite the rain, a surprisingly large number of matches were played.
Berwick held out for 38 overs but found runs hard to accumulate.
Strathmore County's opening attack of Kevin Thomson and Mark Mudie soon
had wickets falling and their replacements, Andy Monteith and
professional Steve Atkinson, kept up the good work as Berwick succumbed
on 54 and lost by seven wickets.
West Lothian returned from Dundee HS FP with their first win. The home
side got off to a good start with an opening partnership of 30 from Adam
Heather and Bruce Dyer, and 83 runs were on the board when the third
wicket went down. Ian Beven had accounted for both openers and later
took three more wickets as Dundee sank to 129 for nine.
West Lothian's batting fortunes improved when Beven joined David
Fleming, and they saw the score to a winning 130 for three, with Beven
adding the top score of 41 not out to his best bowling of 5-15.

* TIM Munton took three for 45 on his return to competitive action,
three months after back surgery, as defending champions Warwickshire
scored their first AXA Equity &amp; Law League win of the season on a faster
scoring rate against Somerset at Edgbaston.
Warwickshire stacked up a formidable 260 for seven, Neil Smith making
a Sunday League-best 71 and Roger Twose 58. Somerset then reached 177
for five chasing a revised target of 189 in 29 overs, Graham Rose making
49.
Lancashire snatched a thrilling victory against Nottinghamshire at Old
Trafford to stay top of the table.
Their 10-match winning start to the season looked set to end when they
slumped to 94 for six in the twenty-sixth over in reply to
Nottinghamshire's 39-over total of 172 for five, which included 63 by
Tim Robinson.
But Graham Lloyd (59no), who hit his third successive Sunday
half-century, and Ian Austin (36) put on 79 in 12 overs as Lancashire
headed towards a four-wicket win on 173 for six -- the victory confirmed
when Kevin Evans bowled a wide with the first ball of the last over.
Essex pulled off a thrilling two-run victory over Middlesex in a
37-over-a-side contest at Chelmsford -- despite the all-round efforts of
visiting skipper Mike Gatting who claimed four for 44 with his gentle
seamers and then top scored on 46.
Middlesex, with medium pace man Ronnie Irani taking three for 32,
still fell short of their opponents' 178 for six, which owed much to
Graham Gooch, who came in at No.4 and struck 50 from 37 balls, and Paul
Prichard (54).
Glamorgan veteran Steve Barwick took six for 43 to prove the
inspiration behind an 11-run win as Kent, who were dismissed for 169
chasing 180 for six, suffered their first one-day defeat of the season
in a contest reduced by rain to 23 overs a side at Tunbridge Wells.
Mark Ealham, with a competition-best 47 off 24 balls, and Matthew
Fleming (36 off 19) kept the home side in the chase. But the efforts of
Tony Cottey (52) proved crucial despite Dean Headley's Sunday best four
for 59.

SOME of the terms in this yachting Diary from the Rover Series in
Tarbert may be a touch technical for the average reader. But bear with
us.
For instance, quite a few of the 250 or so boats which set off from
Gourock on Thursday night for the offshore race up to Loch Fyne, fell
into holes. Worry not, we're not talking disaster of Bermuda Triangle
proportions off The Cloch.
The holes were in the wind and, far from being in peril, the yachtsmen
were in no danger of moving at all for anything up to two hours.
When they do get going there is this business of luffing up. The rules
state that if you are downwind of a boat going in the same direction
then you can go ahead and luff up. It's a bit like being in a stock car
race, although while you can't ram into the other yacht, you can force
it to slow down or change direction.
Confirmed luffer-uppers will apparently indulge in the practice even
if the victim is perilously close to a spot of dry land. This can often
lead to infringements of Rule 75 of the yachting code. Rule 75 deals
with the use of foul language and ungentlemanly conduct.
Frankly, the Diary was surprised to hear that such things go on in the
yachting world but, as when people get behind the wheel of a car, when
some yachties get into their oilskins and get a hold of the tiller, nice
Dr Jekyll turns into Mr Hyde.
The Rover Series at Tarbert continues to grow and with almost 300
boats involved, is beginning to rival Cowes for certain classes of race.
With upwards of 2000 crew members involved it is a substantial
participant sport. It is not a great spectator sport unless you get a
berth on a large, official cruiser with a calm sea and a gin and tonic
to hand. Even better, if you get a close-up view of some luffing-up or
infractions of Rule 75.
The Tarbert regatta has considerable competition from Irish events at
Bangor and Cork. Cork, for instance, has become a major social event
with a large tented village where the bars alone rake in #600,000.
Tarbert has its own tent this year. The quayside marquee has been the
setting for a succession of memorable parties. The tent has hosted what
has been virtually an Argyll music festival with jazz, brass, big band,
and pipe band music.
The highlight was a performance by Campbeltown Brass. The schoolkids
who make up the band were delighted, but slightly bemused by the
ecstatic reception accorded them.
Strangely enough, it was not their nautical numbers that went down
best, but the aerial theme tunes from the Dambusters and 633 Squadron
films. The boat people joined in, some pretending to be airyplanes,
others looking through bomb-sights, Dambuster-style.
The yachties also danced to a lively rendition of Onward Christian
Soldier. The odd glass of free beer from sponsors McEwans may have been
a factor.
Many of the boats taking part in the Rover Series appear to have been
christened during such social events. The Diary's favourite is
Absolutely from the Port Edgar yacht club near Edinburgh. A
straightforward name, you might think, but on the boat it is spelt
Abso!*?#*!*lutely in that Scottish way of using language prohibited by
Rule 75 to split syllables.
A boat from Pwllheli, but captained by one David McLean, is called
Babbalaas. The crew, obviously tired of explanations, wear T-shirts
emblazoned with a dictionary definition that Babbalaas is a slang word
for a hangover.
Very direct, but something we do not wish explained, is Snot Rag, the
inelegant name given to a Sonata class vessel from Royal Gourock yacht
club.
Boyd Tunnock, of the Uddingston baked goods dynasty, has reversed the
basic ingredient which made the family fortune and called his boat
Lemarac. If his fleet expands he could go for Gol Lemarac, Refaw
Lemarac, or even Ekac Aet.
But back to the sport where a big boat called Local Hero was leading
after two days. This local hero is actually from Australia. It is owned
and skippered by Geoff Howison, the former estate agent who sold out his
shares in Slater Hogg and Howison for untold millions some years ago and
retired at the age of 17[1/2] (well, nearly) to go down under and build
boats.
Geoff is obviously doing quite well at it, leaving in his wake this
weekend such Scottish Admiral Cup hopefuls as Macleod's Isle of Skye.

CANADA have made four changes in an attempt to strengthen their
lineout play in Wednesday's Rugby World Cup Pool A match against
Australia in Port Elizabeth.
The Canadians were outplayed in the lineouts during Friday's clash
with Romania -- but still emerged with a 34-3 victory.
Coach Ian Birtwell brings in lock Gareth Rowlands, hooker Karl
Svoboda, and flankers Gordon MacKinnon and John Hutchinson.

England 24, Argentina 18
WILL Carling limped off at the end of England's first World Cup match
-- just as his team had limped to victory over Argentina in Durban.
For the second consecutive international, Rob Andrew landed 24 points
in a try-less England win.
Andrew, at least, maintained high international standards with a
perfect display -- six penalties attempted and all on target; two
drop-kicks through the posts and another one which was disallowed when
Andrew forgot it came from a free kick.
Despite England's depression at being one of only three of 16 nations
in South Africa without a try after the first round of matches, the
victory is in the bank.
But England's position as second seeds and third favourites looked
totally unrealistic against the Pumas, who scored two fine tries and
would have pressed far harder if they had not missed eight goal-kicks.
Andrew said: ''I have not seen us play that badly for years. We just
never got out of the blocks.
''I am not taking anything away from Argentina, because they played
very well. Their forwards played very well. They were very physical and
caused us a lot of problems.
''Manager Jack Rowell kept saying all last season that we had to hit
the ground running when we got to South Africa. He didn't mean running
backwards.''
Carling stated baldly: ''It was a poor performance. But to win when we
played so badly is something.
''It's frustrating not to score tries. We need quick release of the
ball from the breakdown and we failed.''
Manager Rowell will not tolerate such indifferent form. There will be
changes for the midweek match with Italy.
Some of them will be pre-planned in order to rotate the squad. But
some changes might be real promotion for a current reserve, and
relegation for an established player.
Too many of the normally influential forwards like Victor Ubogu, Tim
Rodber, and Ben Clarke simply drifted. However, exceptions were the
locks Martin Johnson and Martin Bayfield, who dominated the lineout by
19-8.
A disappointed Rowell said: ''If we do not improve we will go out of
the Cup faster than we came out here.
''We have got to bounce back or face the writing on the wall.''

I HAVE found out how the South Africans have made it possible for them
and their players to become the best in the world once more, and here,
in Western Province, is a system of payments to players that is designed
to keep them in the Province for the length of their playing careers,
but also means that their top stars don't have to work that hard -- if
at all.
An autonomous body called Western Province Promotions has been formed,
which, in South African legalese, is a ''Section 21 Company'' -- meaning
that it is a ''body incorporated not for gain.''
All the money raised is paid out to players.
Morne du Plessis, the former Springbok captain and current South
African team manager, is a director, and the players in the province are
contracted to the company.
The company attracts major sponsorship, and that money is then paid
out to the players. They also receive weekly match expenses for taking
part in games, which are, in line with an SARFU edict, 900 Rand,
approximately #150 a game.
Everyone in this part of South Africa acknowledges that there is this
system of payments to players, and I played for a ''young crocks'' team
from the Villagers club who all knew of it, and recognised that it went
on. Witness, even, all of the sponsored cars for the Villagers' first
XV.
It's the quantification of this extra amount that is more difficult,
although Mornay, at the first open South African training on Sunday
morning, was happy to admit that it happened, and I told him that I
would write about it, and he was happy about that. I suspect that the
South Africans want to get it out in the open, and I suspect that du
Plessis does especially.
I know that the structure is like this. The amount that a player
receives weekly depends on how senior he is, for example a full
internationalist will be rated for his earnings on the number of caps
that he has, and money paid also depends on whether the team has won or
not. Win bonuses exist.
Different sources have given me the same number for the highest-paid
player, Joel Stransky, the current stand-off, who is reputed to receive
5000 rand a week. All year. That is more than #800 a week. Most players
earn much less, and that has, almost unbelievably, meant that players
have gone on strike recently.
An amateur game? The contract that they sign with the province
stipulates that the contents of the contract are secret, but Mornay du
Plessis denies that the sums in any way amount to a wage.
''It is pocket money,'' he said. What no-one denies is that it
happens; it just seems to be a fact of life that this World Cup is
changing things, and the amount of time that players spend on rugby had
to be recompensed.
Western Province aim to be the best in the land, they tour Scotland
next year, and for the money they receive from Western Province
Promotions the players are expected to promote rugby in the region.
They are called on to go to underprivileged areas to coach and take
part in training sessions. Twenty clubs have been identified, and each
of them has been allocated three players to go along to train with them
at their session. ''Adoption'' is the word they use. In exchange for the
money they are not only expected to play and win, but to spread the word
about rugby.
But one of the main thrusts of these payments, undoubtedly, is to keep
the best players in this province and halt the movement of the biggest
stars between the different regions of South Africa, something that has
always happened in the past. It is a fact of life over here that rugby
is the game and that money attracts players. English players are
rumoured to be staying on to play in Natal.
Whereas Western Province players receive their money weekly, almost as
a salary, Transvaal, who have a similar system, operate on a three-year
payout, again to stop the movement of their best players elsewhere.
Movement is deemed to be breach of contract, and so: no stay -- no pay!
Everyone here also admits that the new system, with this ''Section 21''
company, is just to scrap an old way of doing things, which was the
traditional brown envelope.
I've got to admit that I've found it all incredibly interesting.
Over here they have an ethos in the public that means that they
understand that one of the most important aspects of the country is that
they do well on the sporting field. They are so unlike us back in
Scotland. We seem to revel in our teams failing; we seem to dislike and
distrust sportsmen and women who want to reach the top.
''Whatever it takes to be the best'' is a phrase you hear often from
average rugby fans. They want their rugby team to be the best in the
world, and they accept that it means that the stars need time to train
at the expense of their time to work. Many of the players who do
actually work have lost their jobs in the past, James Small being one of
them. Looking through the South African team sheet there are a few
''self-employed'' lads, I can tell you. Self-employed in rugby that is,
of course.
The big question is: How do we ever beat them, and do we now try to do
the same? Interesting times here in Cape Town, and interesting times
ahead for world rugby, I can tell you.

'Lomu's some player. If he was Irish, we'd play him in the second
row!' -- Terry Kingston
In South Africa
THE original billing might have been blond on blond -- Ireland's Simon
Geoghegan one-on-one with All Black golden boy Jeff Wilson -- but at
Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday night, the show was
stolen by another winger, the dark destroyer Jonah Lomu.
Lomu -- Joe to close acquaintances, but don't stand too close --
stands 6ft 4in in his stocking soles and weighs in, conservatively, at
18st of ebony-hard bone, sinew, and muscle.
The Aucklander, just 20 and winning only his third cap in the Kiwis'
43-19 win over the men from the Emerald Isle, marked his arrival on the
world stage with two tries and a display of direct running -- scattering
Irishmen like ninepins -- that takes up exactly where the Kiwis' 1991
RWC rugby league deserter ''Inga the winga'' Tuigamala left off.
The word from New Zealand is that Lomu may well be about to follow the
same route. The buzz on the Kiwi circuit is that the Auckland Warriors
rugby league side are chasing Lomu but that his agent -- yes, agent, how
times change -- has placed a #3m price-tag on his man.
Lomu's bone-crunching display against Ireland on Saturday, in front of
a global TV audience of millions, will have had the agent -- a Welshman,
we hear -- rubbing his hands with glee. As each Irishman was blown aside
like a straw in the high veldt breeze, the asking price will have ticked
satisfyingly upward.
Afterwards, the Kiwi legend Colin Meads, a member of the All Black
management team was asked if he, with all his experience, had ever seen
a player like young Jonah. Old Pinetree, with what might have been
construed as a smile in the correct lighting, replied: ''Oh yes, I've
seen lots of players like Lomu. But never on the wing!''
The sentiment was echoed by Irish captain Terry Kingston, who
observed, perhaps ironically, one couldn't be sure: ''He's some player.
If he was Irish we'd play him in the second row!''
Lomu himself, as shy and self-effacing in his day-time togs as he is
terrifyingly destructive in that All Black garb, was asked if he was
confident that he would remain within the Union code.
He replied: ''The only thing on my mind at the moment is playing World
Cup rugby for the All Blacks. I want to give 110% so that I can be sure
of keeping my place for the next game. I haven't spoken to anybody.''
If the youngster wants to keep things that way then, for the next few
weeks, he better keep his phone off the hook.
So far as the game itself was concerned, Ireland played as Ireland
always do, with pride, passion, fire, and fury. They handed the All
Blacks a rucking lesson, winning the ruck-count by a margin of two to
one.
They were leading after seven minutes, Gary Halpin charging in for his
try like a demented rhino. Eric Elwood kicked the conversion but, sadly
for the Irish, this was to be a night when his normally reliable
goal-kicking prowess would desert him.
Andrew Mehrtens, a slight figure but an adequate enough replacement
for Grant Fox at fly-half, kicked the Kiwis back on terms with a couple
of penalties and tries from Lomu and Frank Bunce, both converted by
Mehrtens, flattered New Zealand with a 20-7 lead.
Ireland, with vociferous support from the 38,000 Ellis Park crowd,
clawed back to 20-12 at the interval by virtue of a try from Denis
McBride after a scorching run by Geoghegan but in the second period the
All Black machine, never deviating from the pattern of grind and churn,
absorbed almost everything that the Irish could throw at them, a
momentary defensive slip costing them a try by David Corkery, converted
by Elwood, two minutes from the end.
New Zealand's second-half points came via tries by Lomu, Josh
Kronfeld, and Glen Osborne, Mehrtens adding two penalties and a
conversion.
There was more good news for New Zealand when it was confirmed that
the ankle injury sustained by Jeff Wilson was not as bad as first feared
and that he will be available for selection against Wales on Wednesday.
The All Blacks, 1987 world champions, were impressive but not overly
so. Ireland exposed some frailties, rucked them off the park, yet still
lost. That is the problem for the opposition. They are always gey hard
tae bate.
Irish manager Neol Murphy's post-match diagnosis was exactly right:
''They were a good side but not, how shall I put it, so awesome a side
as some All Black outfits of the seventies and eighties.''
Awesome? No. Unbeatable? Certainly not. But it will take a good side
to do it, and taking the sheen off Jonah Lomu's sparkling and
spectacular wing-play must be one of the prerequisites for success.

SAWUBONA. It's only right that, having wished you good morning in
Afrikaans last week, I should redress the balance by showing that I'm
fluent in Zulu, too. I mentioned Rorke's Drift once, but I think I got
away with it!
I think, too, that I should reassure all regular readers of these
pages that Brian Meek is alive and well, and with us here in South
Africa as the SRU's media liaison man.
See journalism, I don't know what Brian is making all the fuss about.
The game against Ivory Coast is now ancient history. World records
might have tumbled like ninepins, but we're not daft and we know that
our World Cup campaign really begins against Tonga in the Loftus
Versfeld stadium here in Pretoria tomorrow.
By the end I felt sorry for the Ivory Coast. The big thing for them
was just getting here. They've now got to play Tonga and France, and
they must be wondering how many points they're going to give away.
We wanted to beat them, and beat them convincingly, but I don't think
that we allowed our superiority to descend into the kind of arrogance
that some sides might have displayed.
Their captain, Athanese Dali, made a nice speech at the reception
afterwards in which he complimented us on how we had been big-hearted in
victory.
The highlight of their day seemed to be having their pictures taken
with Gavin Hastings. They were queuing up for happy snaps with the world
record-breaker.
At one stage against the Ivory Coast I thought that none of the rest
of us was going to get a look in. He even popped up on my wing once and
I had to lay on a try for him. Only joking, Gav.
The wives and girlfriends joined us after the game, and on Saturday we
visited Gold Reef City in Johannesburg.
It's a kind of theme park, showing Jo'burg as it was last century.
It's a bit off-putting, though, when the first signpost that greets you
when you go through the entrance is a notice warning that weapons have
to be unloaded here. Stirling was never like this.
We went down the goldmine. There's still gold in it, but they stopped
production about 15 years ago because it was no longer economical.
Our guide was a 6ft 8in giant and Doddie Weir was able to look him
straight in the eye. The tour was rivetting. No, the big disappointment
was there were no free samples.
The team to play Tonga was announced today. I'm in, and chuffed to get
a second game. You always hope you're going to be picked but you can't
take anything for granted.
I played against them when we toured the South Seas in 1993. They're
very physical and could well prove quite a handful.
Ian Jardine and Scott Hastings are in at centre and so they both have
the opportunity to influence the selectors for the game against France
on Saturday, as does Derek Patterson at scrum half. They all deserve
their chance.
It was especially good news for Jardie, because he's 30 today (Sorry,
Jardie, that 100-rand bribe just wasn't enough).
He was desperately unlucky to get injured against France in February,
because I reckon that if he hadn't been hurt then he would have been in
the side for the entire Five Nations' Championship.
I'm up against a guy called Alaska Taufa tomorrow night. The mind
boggles as to how a Tongan could get a name like Alaska. Was his mother
influenced by a passing iceberg? Probably not.
In any case, let's hope we can freeze him out tomorrow.
I've never been inside the famous Test stadium but it certainly looks
impressive from the outside.
I know that Stirling County president Billy Gibson will be reading
this, so Billy, fear not, I'll try and get the architect's plans. They
might come in handy for our redevelopment programme at Bridgehaugh!
Hamba kahle, as my Zulu friends say. See you soon. And, if old Meekey
gets a permanent taste for the good life out here, then I just want the
Editor to know that I'm available!

IT IS one of the blackest moments in rugby history, but the infamous
chomp by Springbok Johan Le Roux on All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick's
ear has been turned into a song which typifies some mickey-taking at New
Zealand's expense at the World Cup.
Antipodean journalists were bewildered to hear a song titled ''Achy
Breaky Ears'' played over the public address system before the kick-off
of the match between Western Samoa and Italy on Saturday.
The song, a play on ''Achy Breaky Heart'' by American country music
star Billy Ray Cyrus, contained the chorus: ''Don't bite my ears, my
achy breaky ears, and leave me bleeding on the ground.''
In an ugly moment in the second Test of South Africa's 1994 tour of
New Zealand, enforcer Le Roux bit Fitzpatrick's ear in retaliation for
an off-the-ball incident. Le Roux subsequently earned a lengthy
suspension, which prohibits him from playing in the world tournament.
While the 14,000-strong crowd was largely oblivious to the number, it
is doubtful if it fitted the tournament's much-trumpeted principles of
unity and fair play.
''It depends on the context,'' laughed Rugby World Cup co-ordinator
Brian Skirrow. ''It's the first I've heard of it.
''If it was appropriate and amusing, then okay, but if not, perhaps it
wasn't in the best possible taste.''
The song is not the only dig directed at the All Blacks, who are
traditional arch-rivals of South Africa.
A trading bank uses the haka (war dance), performed by the All Blacks
before kick-off and sacred to the team and its supporters, to humorous
effect in a television advertisement.

THE success of Ajax in last week's European Cup final did not simply
underline the potency of their youth policy, it also demonstrated the
immense, and ever-growing, financial clout of the Champions' League.
The involvement of the Dutch champions all the way through their group
games to the final itself in Vienna last week, guaranteed them a profit
for the season of $25m.
It is an incredible figure for a club from Holland, where domestic
gates are never likely to match those at, say Ibrox, over a season. The
cash has come, in the main, from the club's European involvement.
And it tells you why Rangers are making ever more determined efforts
to be among the big guns when the group games take place next season.
That kind of money-making would push the Scottish champions even further
ahead of the country's other clubs.
Already their power base is considerably greater than any of the
others. The one club who could challenge, Celtic, have still to finish
rebuilding Parkhead and many millions of pounds will remain tied up in
that project for several seasons to come.
If Rangers were to get past the dangerous opening hurdle of the
tournament's preliminary round then they would find themselves with a
guaranteed income from television, sponsors, and gate receipts which
would dwarf anything they have made before.
Even without a run into the quarter-final stages they would amass the
type of money Ajax have just banked.
In essence, they would then be able to wipe out any existing overdraft
and still have huge reserves of cash to invest in more and more big-name
players.
Anyone who wonders why the Ibrox club are ready to gamble on Gazza has
the answer now. The stakes in European soccer are now so high that any
risk is worth taking.
To go back to Ajax and their victory -- former Scotland team manager
Andy Roxburgh, now UEFA's technical director, was in the Ernst Happel
Stadium last week extolling the virtues of the Dutch club's policy which
saw three teenagers take part in the game against AC Milan.
They were Clarence Seedorf, Nwanko Kanu, and Patrick Kluivert, with
the latter two making most impact on the game when they appeared as
second-half substitutes with Kluivert eventually claiming the winning
goal.
''Just look at them,'' enthused Roxburgh, ''these young players, three
of them still teenagers and they can go out and play like that. It is
great for the game. Magnificent.
''There was a spell just before half-time when I thought Milan might
sneak something, but Ajax held on and suddenly, when the changes came
after half-time, we saw why everyone in Europe has been looking to them
for some inspiration. That is how we all like to see the game played.''
As well as the attacking ideas of the Ajax coach, Louis van Gaal,
there is something else we in Scotland should look at in some detail. If
young players can go into the biggest club game in the world -- the
European Cup final -- then why do our managers and coaches keep telling
us that teenagers cannot be risked in premier division games?
Isn't it about time that young talent is given its head? Shouldn't our
clubs look at the Ajax example and send on new, fresh faces to brighten
our dreary domestic game? And wouldn't it be good if, when the
youngsters are given the opportunity, they are allowed to express
themselves the way the Ajax players were able to do?
When Kanu and Kluivert appeared against the ageing maestros of Milan
they brought a sense of enjoyment with them, a sense of freedom instead
of the harried look which too often accompanies our home players into
the action.
You had the feeling that these young men were being asked to do what
they were good at and, in both cases, that was attacking the opposition
and parading their exceptional skills.
You could never see van Gaal ask either of them to drop back and help
the team defend. Nor could you imagine either of them doing that.
They were obviously in the game to enjoy themselves and if our club
managers could only look and learn from their example then the future of
the game would be much brighter than it would seem to be at the moment.
They will get the chance to see them with Ajax again next season
because while the big money predators gather to look at the young Dutch
players the Euro profits will ensure that Ajax can keep the men who have
dazzled the Continent throughout their triumphant campaign this season.
A club spokesman insisted after the cup victory: ''We are able to
reward the players who have helped us to win this trophy once again and
we have the cash in the bank which will make it easy to turn down any
offers from other clubs in other countries.
''Quite simply, there have been times in the past when we have to had
to sell. But this is not one of those times.''
During the season the Amsterdam club paid out an average salary of
$500,000 to the players, not massive by Italian standards perhaps, but
huge in comparison to most other countries.
And enough to keep those multi-talented teenagers in Amsterdam for
some seasons to come.

WESTERN Samoa blasted out a warning to England by crushing Italy 42-18
in the first World Cup pool B match in East London on Saturday.
The Samoans, surprise quarter-finalists four years ago, looked
determined from the moment they clenched their fists over their hearts
during their national anthem and had too much muscle, pace, and skill
for Italy.
Full back Mike Umaga was the Samoans' star, but all of the back-line
produced superb displays in their six-try show. Wingers Brian Lima and
George Harder both touched down twice, while the Samoans' other tries
came from No.8 Shem Tatupu and fly-half Darren Kellett, who also kicked
five goals from nine attempts.
Italian goalkicker Diego Dominguez was less successful, but gave his
side an early lead through a sixth-minute drop-goal. Wing Marcello
Cuttita scored a try just before half-time and full back Paolo Vaccari
grabbed a consolation effort later, but the Italians rarely threatened.
The Samoans face Argentina in their next match tomorrow, while Italy
meet England on Wednesday.
* IRELAND full back Jim Staples has been ruled out of the rest of the
campaign with a broken bone in his right hand.
Staples was injured in Saturday night's 43-19 Pool C opening match
defeat by New Zealand in Johannesburg. The injury was later diagnosed in
hospital as a broken scafoid. Staples will be replaced by Garryowen
centre Philip Danaher, who joins the squad in Bloemfontein today.
Jonathan Bell, who also had to be replaced in the game against New
Zealand because of a hand injury, is definitely out of Ireland's next
match -- against Japan in Bloemfontein on Wednesday.
However, No.8 Paddy Johns, who picked up a knock against the All
Blacks, will be fit.
Simon Geoghegan, Michael Bradley, and Denis McBride, who all suffered
calf-muscle bruising in last night's game, have also been cleared for
selection against Japan.
* TONGAN flanker Feleti Mahoni is out of the World Cup after having
been sent off during his side's 38-10 defeat against France at Pretoria
on Friday.
Mahoni was dismissed by English referee Steve Lander for trampling on
French loose forward Phillippe Benetton and has been suspended for six
weeks.
* TIM Horan returns for Australia after an absence of 18 months in the
Pool A match against Canada in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday.
Horan last played for his country against France at Parc des Princes
in November 1993 before suffering a career-threatening knee injury in
last year's Super-10 final.
He is now fit enough to resume his place alongside long-time partner
Jason Little in an Australian side stung into nine changes after the
27-18 defeat by South Africa at Newlands in the opening game on
Thursday. Nineteen-year-old Joe Roff wins his first cap on the wing.
* WILLIAM Hill have lengthened England's Cup odds from 9-2 to 11-2
following their disappointing display against Argentina. South Africa
are 7-4 favourites with Australia at 3-1. Scotland are 22-1, with Wales
down from 80-1 to 66-1.

New Zealand 43, Ireland 19
AWESOME All Black wing Jonah Lomu was just too big and strong for
spirited Ireland.
Lomu, the 19st and 6ft 5in 20-year-old sensation, scored two tries and
made another with a remarkable 70-yard run as New Zealand triumphed. But
the Irish gave it everything, even shocking their mighty opponents by
taking an eighth-minute lead with a try by prop Garret Halpin and
staying ahead for the first half-hour.
They also scored a brilliant second try just before half-time when
flanker Denis McBride finished off a thrilling move.
But this was the night when New Zealand launched their huge wing Lomu
into the world spotlight. And the All Blacks' all-round display
explained why their hopes of winning the World Cup are high.
However, New Zealand skipper Sean Fitzpatrick admitted he was a
relieved man afterwards.
''It was a tough one. We've been waiting a long time for it and I'm
just glad we got the result we desired,'' he said.
''Ireland always come at you like that -- they played like madmen for
30 minutes -- and all credit to them, because it was an enjoyable game
and I'm sure the crowd got their money's worth.''
Lomu, the star of the recent Hong Kong Sevens, is a weapon so potent
that he could be the deciding factor in who takes the Webb Ellis Trophy.
Ireland's players simply could not bring him down, except with a
perfect tackle around the ankles -- and the Irish must have been glad
that Lomu did not touch the ball until 21 minutes.
His first try came when he barged through Richard Wallace's tackle to
give New Zealand the lead for the first time. His second came two
minutes into the second half, a clinical finish after centre Frank Bunce
put him away.
But the highlight of the evening came in 68 minutes. Given the ball on
his own 22, Lomu barged his way through four tackles and was just two
yards short of capping his breathtaking charge with yet another score
when Simon Geoghegan finally brought him to earth by clinging on to his
right leg.
But Lomu still had the athleticism to flip up the ball as he fell for
flanker Josh Kronfeld to plunge over.
In a bruising battle Ireland full back Jim Staples broke a bone in his
right hand and had to go off late in the first half.
Kiwi right wing Jeff Wilson did not finish the game, either, because
of blurred vision sustained in a clash with Staples.
A last-gasp try by full back Glen Osborne gave New Zealand a large
winning margin, but Ireland should take great pride from their own
performance, which also contained a try in 77 minutes for flanker David
Corkery.
New Zealand's other try was scored by Bunce in 34 minutes when he
charged down an attempted clearance kick by Brendan Mullin.
Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens, another 20-year-old who had an impressive
second international, kicked four penalties and three conversions while
Ireland's four other points came from two Eric Elwood conversions.

Scottish Claymores 13, Barcelona Dragons 16
DESPITE a remarkable performance from running back Siran Stacy, the
Scottish Claymores crashed out of contention for a place in next month's
World Bowl, shot down 16-13 by the Barcelona Dragons in front of fewer
than 6000 fans at Murrayfield on Saturday night.
With just 70 seconds remaining in the game, and the scores tied at 13,
Barcelona kicker Scott Szeredy calmly converted a 49-yard field goal to
edge out the luckless Claymores and give the Dragons the unexpected win.
The Scots have made a habit this season of losing out in last-minute
situations, and this latest result put paid to any outside chance the
Claymores had of playing in the June final in Amsterdam.
The Dragons were on the scoreboard first when Szeredy, who made the
difference with a winning field goal the first time the teams met in
Barcelona in April, booted through a 26-yard field goal midway in the
first quarter.
Szeredy added to the Dragons' total at the start of the second
quarter, kicking a 23-yard field goal after Claymores' cornerback Darren
Butler tipped away a certain touchdown catch from Barcelona's Mario
Henry.
Scotland got the ball moving after forcing the Dragons to punt on
their next possession. Stacy made most of the ground running up the
middle of the field. A 13-yard pass from Matt Blundin to the all-purpose
back got the Claymores into scoring range, and, after taking a timeout,
Blundin fired a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Allen DeGraffenreid, who
made a spectacular diving catch in the Dragons' end-zone for the
touchdown. The Scots went 7-6 ahead when Sean Conley kicked the extra
point.
The Claymores put together another impressive drive towards the end of
the third quarter, with Stacy grabbing Blundin passes for 21 and 11-yard
gains. But the drive stalled when a Blundin pass to Lee Harris was
tipped by Dragons' cornerback Tracy Smith, forcing the Scots to settle
for a 35-yard field goal, which Conley converted for a 10-6 lead.
The Scots continued their dominance into the fourth quarter, again
mainly through the efforts of Stacy, who kept the momentum going with 11
and 12-yard gains, before DeGraffenreid made a superb 21-yard catch, and
his receiver colleague Tim Barnett a 19-yard grab, to bring the Scots
down to the Dragons' seven-yard line.
But a glorious opportunity to finish the Dragons off was missed when
Blundin failed to complete two passes to tight end Dwayne Chandler.
Conley lined up another field goal from 27 yards but slipped as he
kicked -- the low attempt was blocked by Barcelona tackle Louis Age --
and the Dragons recovered the ball at their own 18-yard line.
Dragons' quarterback Jay Walker moved the ball out of danger,
scrambling 11 yards and then, on a first-and-10 play at his own 29-yard
line, launched a deep pass to speedy receiver Shelby Hill, who caught it
at midfield and outran Claymores' safety David Wilson for a stunning
71-yard touchdown. With less than seven minutes left in the game Szeredy
kicked the extra point to make it 13-10 to Dragons.
The Claymores continued to move the ball but another Blundin pass
which was broken up by Tracy Smith, intended for DeGraffenreid, forced
Conley to kick from 30 yards, tying the scores.
But the Dragons upset the home team at the two-minute warning, moving
the ball quickly with short passes to Tyree Davis and Hill to set up
Szeredy for his game-winning kick from 49 yards.
Claymores' head coach Jim Criner said: ''I thought our football team
played well enough to win tonight. We just have not had the breaks go
our way and we've just not been good enough to overcome some of the
adversity we've had to deal with.''
Stacy, who is now almost certain to play in the National Football
League at the end of his World League season, was equally devastated by
the defeat. ''I'm just as shocked as the coach and the rest of the
guys,'' said Stacy. ''I feel we should be a 6-2 team -- the only team
that really beat us was Amsterdam.'' Other result:
Exhibition match at Murrayfield -- Scottish Universities 54, English
Universities 0.

THE Drymen Show entered its 168th year on Saturday there. That's a
long time, but it is not very far away from Glasgow.
It is an agricultural show if you like, with a fair input from local
farmers. Those of you who listen to, say, The Archers (and I am one who
does), would be hard put to be sympathetic to the farming community, for
the agricultural folk of the South of England, once you grasp the greed
of these people, would have you out in the fields with poison gas, just
looking for farmers.
It is not so in most of the country and especially in Drymen, a
hundred and sixty-eight years of it. And a lot of farmers, their hands
horny, their nails dirty, their bank-balances shaky: farming is not an
easy job, and even a city slicker like myself can tell that.
But the Drymen Show is for acres of enjoyment. A suspension for once
of the unremitting toil of the small farmer, for the Drymen Show is
basically about the small farmer. Drymen is minutes away, for heaven's
sake, from one of the most lawless spots of Europe, Possilpark, a
housing scheme renowned for its hoodlums and deprivation.
When I found myself in the Royal Bank of Scotland trailer, and a dram
offered to me, I could not help but think of the fact that the farmers
were getting a wee goldie or two, and so was I, and the day before I had
been the recipient of sponsorship in Edinburgh at the Scottish Press
Awards, and that perhaps the lowest wages in the UK existed among
agricultural workers, if not the thousands of bank employees, and not
just the Scottish wallahs who had lost their jobs over the years.
While my colleagues elsewhere on the sports desk were watching that
wretched Scottish Cup final, I was having a libation or two with Sandy
Grieve and Ian Cross of the local Balfron Rotary Club, farmer David
Steel from Kierhall Farm near Buchlyvie, was chatting away to me while I
was horribly diverted by the nineteen-year-old young girls in jodphurs,
and diverted first by the sheepdogs, then the goats, (last year the lack
of goats disappointed), the large and magnificent bovine beasts, and
then we had the heavy horses. Percherons, Limousins, and Shires: none
makes up for the sheer nobility of the Clydesdales, the most magnificent
large horses of all. But then later came the light horses competitions
and this is when we talk of sport.
At this level of showjumping, even in the early Drymen Show, we have
top horsemen and women. Ron Brady hails from Dunfermline, a
working-class man, not from the traditionally upper-class backgrounds of
horse-riding: he used to be a tailor for John Collier's.
Today, Ron is a window to watch, if you recollect the old telly
jingle. He is a Grade A jumper and gets the best horses to jump with. It
is not an easy job and expensive to start up. Ron paid more than #200
for his pink -- the red jaicket to you -- and boots can cost as much as
five hundred quid. As an experienced rider of fifteen years competitive
standing, he knows a lot about horse-riding and earns a full-time living
at the business.
Ron started off at the age of 17 and now earns his living with horses,
Grade A jumpers. He doesn't earn much except one thing. He lives for
horses. Shows like the Drymen are lifeblood to him and he can certainly
do without the recent scandal which sadly attached itself to the
Limousin giants at the weekend in which allegations were made that
untoward breeding had occurred with these huge French horses. Nothing to
do with Ron and the ''light horse'' entrants, and nothing to do with the
august Drymen Show.
As farmers told me throughout the day's tournament -- the largest
one-day Scottish agricultural and horse show which, even on a wet day
attracted more than 10,000 visitors -- this is a day for country people
who live on the outskirts of one of the most famous industrial cities in
the world.
Said Gordon Bryant, thirty-four years in this country but himself from
Reading: ''We're not even twenty minutes outside of Possilpark and here
we are on some of the most beautiful countryside in the world. Have a
Glengoyne malt.'' Glengoyne is the distillery next door.
But Glengoyne wasn't the only stall. The crafts and food stalls were
out as well. Cost me a fortune just buying. Worth it, too.

Porthlethen yesterday after a heavy downpour on the inward half had
scuppered them in all but one match. Following a 4.5-1.5 morning result,
the home side ran out comfortable 11-4 winners.
* FORMER winner Kathleen Sutherland, of Royal Montrose, battled
through heavy rain to defeat Susan Simpson of the host club, Kirriemuir,
4 and 2 yesterday in the final of the Angus Ladies Championship.
Semi-finals -- Simpson beat M McDonald (Abertay), 4 and 3; Sutherland
beat A Chree (Panmuir Monifieth), 1 hole.
* STIRLINGSHIRE won the Bank of Scotland Boys' Team championship at
Milngavie yesterday when Craig Lee, Paul McKechnie, Chris Love, and
David Boslem carded a score of 367 to finish two shots clear of the team
from Fife.
Ayrshire team member Graham Fox, of West Kilbride, fired the best
individual round, a two-over-par 70. Results:
367 -- Stirlingshire (C Lee, P McKechnie, C Love, D Boslem). 369 --
Fife (B Mason, F Hutcheson, S Whiteford, M Donaldson). 374 --
Lanarkshire (G Campbell, I Brattey, G Dingwall, F McLaughlin); Ayrshire
(G Fix, T McInally, G Shannon, N McCormick).

GRAHAM Rankin completed the biggest weekend of his burgeoning amateur
career at the Old Course yesterday, beating Gordon Sherry by two strokes
to win the prestigious St Andrews Links Trophy title.
The 29-year-old bricklayer's merciless pounding of the Home of Golf
saw him finish his four rounds at 11-under-par 276 to see off the
challenge of the luckless Sherry and at the same time set up a new low
aggregate score for the event.
The previous best -- seven-under-par 280 -- had been set jointly by
Garry Hay in 1993 and Stuart Bouvier in 1990, but when the Palacerigg
man started his final two rounds at eight under the card, that mark was
always in danger.
Closing rounds of 70 and 71 did the trick and although Kilmarnock
Barassie's gentle giant Sherry matched him stroke by stroke over the
final two rounds, his poorer start on Saturday left him just that little
bit too much to do.
The Ayrshireman, who is without doubt one of Britain's best amateur
prospects, has now had the misfortune of finishing second in the
Champion of Champions at Leven, the Lytham Trophy, and the St Andrews
Links this season alone, as well as being runner-up in last year's
Amateur Championship.
He should have the consolation of a place in the Walker Cup come
September, however, a scenario which Rankin refused to rule himself out
of either, despite having to miss next week's Amateur Championship at
Hoylake for financial reasons.
''That might count against me, I suppose, but hopefully this win will
be taken into consideration,'' said Rankin. ''After all, it is one of
the biggest events in Europe and if you ask who wasn't playing here this
weekend, the answer is not many of the big names.
''I know Garry Hay was overlooked for the Walker Cup in 1993 when he
won here but the way I look at it is, if it comes, it comes -- I'm just
going to enjoy this win now.''
The signposts to Rankin's victory were erected in Saturday's two
rounds when he returned an eight-under-par halfway total of 135 from his
morning visit to the New Course and then his afternoon jaunt on the Old.
Highlight of the three-under-par 68 on the 6657-yard New Course was an
audacious eagle 2 at the 394-yard fifteenth hole, where his No.8-iron
approach from all of 133 yards took two bounces before running sweetly
into the cup.
There were no such stunning highs in the afternoon, but the six
birdies on the Old Course in his five-under-par 67 were ample
compensation for a man patently on top of his game.
The same could not be said of Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher, who found
gauging the pace of the rain-soaked greens a problem as he struggled to
make the top 40 right on the cut on 148, five-over-par.
But the 20-year-old European amateur champion -- who won the Scottish
Champion of Champions title in April and the Lytham Trophy three weeks
ago -- resumed normal service with closing rounds of 71 and 70 to move
into the top 10.
Another prominent Scot to prosper in the better weather of the closing
day was defending champion Barclay Howard, who cured the putting woes of
the opening day to end with rounds of 68 and 70 which propelled him from
deep in the pack to joint third.
Both players harbour realistic hopes of featuring in the Walker Cup,
with Gallacher slightly ahead in the pecking order, but both will be
looking for good Amateur Championship performances in a week's time to
enhance their chances.
* CROW Wood's Robert Jenkins leapfrogged Colin Carson to land the
Parlane McFarlane Trophy at Cathcart Castle yesterday by carding a
second round of 70 which was two over the standard scratch score in
blustery conditions at Cathcart Castle in Glasgow.
Carson, of Cowglen, had tied for the lead with Milngavie's Calum Dunan
following first-round 68s with Jenkins lurking one stroke adrift -- but
Carson fell away with a 72 while Dunan crashed to a 78.
Both David Buchanan of Falkirk Tryst and Ballochmyle's David Mackinnon
had a hole-in-one yesterday at the eleventh and fourteenth holes
respectively, so doubling the number of aces previously scored in the
26-year history of the amateur event. Leading scores:
139 -- R Jenkins (Crow Wood) 69, 70. 140 -- C Carson (Cowglen) 68, 72.
141 -- C Watson (Williamwood) 71, 70. 143 -- H MacDonald (Old Ranfurly)
76, 67; D Orr (East Renfrewshire) 74, 69; R Thornton (Cardross) 71, 72.
144 -- M Kinsler (Gleddoch) 75, 69; M Mazzoni (Greenock) 72, 72. 145 --
A Waugh (Cawder) 76, 69; J Sharp (Caldwell) 74, 71.

AMERICAN Tom Lehman birdied the final two holes to clinch a one-stroke
victory at the $1.4m Colonial Invitation in Fort Worth, Texas,
yesterday.
Lehman sank a 22-foot putt at the final hole at Colonial Country Club
to secure his second US Tour victory, and condemn Australian Craig Parry
to second place.
Parry had a chance to force a play-off, but he narrowly missed his
birdie chance from 16ft at the final hole.
Lehman, last year's Masters runner-up, shot a two-under-par 68 in
calm, almost perfect conditions. He finished at nine-under 271 to
collect $252,000.
''I always believed I was good enough to win. My putting was really
good when I needed it today,'' said Lehman.
He started the final round two strokes behind Parry and quickly tied
for the lead as Parry made a poor start.
Lehman never led outright until his final hole heroics, but he timed
his run to perfection.
Open champion Nick Price, meanwhile, enjoyed his best nine holes of
the year as he finished in style.
Price birdied three of the final four holes for a four-under 66.
The Zimbabwean finished seven strokes off the pace and, although he
failed the defend the title he won in a play-off last year, he was
delighted with his form.
''The last nine holes were the best I've played all year,'' said
Price, the world's top-ranked player who has been struggling this year.
''There are still a few bad swings but over the past two days I've
played a lot better, and I'm putting better. I want to use this 66 as a
confidence booster as I work towards the US Open.''
Price tied for twelfth place and, for all the talk of his supposed
slump, he secured his fourth top-15 finish in seven US Tour appearances
this year.
Nonetheless, he has not started the year as strongly as he played last
year, when he won two major titles, the Open at Turnberry and the US PGA
Championship at Southern Hills. Final aggregates (USA unless stated):
271 -- T Lehman 67, 68, 68, 68.
272 -- C Parry (Australia) 66, 65, 70, 71.
274 -- DA Weibring 66, 72, 69, 67.
275 -- W Austin 67, 69, 66, 73.

67, 73, 68, 68.
277 -- J Maggert 66, 68, 74, 69; R Mediate 69, 68, 70, 70; M
Calcavecchia 70, 67, 68, 72; B Mayfair 68, 71, 67, 71.
278 -- D Duval 67, 71, 76, 64; N Price (Zimbabwe) 73, 69, 70, 66; S
Verplank 69, 68, 70, 71.
* BRITAIN'S Alison Nicholas held off a late challenge from Barb Mucha
as she won the #366,000 Corning Classic in New York yesterday by three
shots.
Nicholas fired a level-par round of 72 for her first career victory on
the US LPGA Tour with a 275 total.
Victory earned her #55,000, pushing her yearly earnings to #70,298 as
she moved into the top 25 on the money list.
Pat Bradley, who led after the first two rounds, could not regain her
form in the final round. She shot a two-over par 74 and three-putted the
eighteenth to finish fourth. Leading final aggregates (USA unless
stated):
275 -- A Nicholas (Britain) 70, 67, 66, 72.
278 -- D Ammaccapane 72, 67, 70, 69; B Mucha 71, 69, 68, 70.
279 -- P Bradley 67, 68, 70, 74.

283 -- L Merten 71, 71, 70, 71; A Fruhwirth 73, 68, 71, 71.
Other aggregates included: 284 -- C Pierce (Britain) 71, 69, 75, 69 B
Daniel 70, 71, 67, 76. 285 -- S Strudwick (Britain) 69, 74, 72, 70. 286
-- C Matthew (Britain) 70, 75, 69, 72. 292 -- P Wright (Britain) 72, 73,
73, 74.
* DAVE Stockton's string of late birdies allowed him to overcome a
final-hole bogey yesterday to give him a one-stroke victory over Isao
Aoki in the $1.1m Quicksilver Classic at Midway, Pennsylvania.
Stockton, who had birdies on the fourth, seventh, and eleventh, had
three straight birdies from the fifteenth for a five-under-par round of
67 to give him an eight-under total of 208 for the 54 holes.  Aoki
birdied the eighteenth for a 69 that left him second alone, one stroke
ahead of defending champion Dave Eichelberger, Tom Wargo, and George
Archer, who started the day with a two-stroke lead.

ENGLAND captain Will Carling will miss his team's second World Cup
match against Italy on Wednesday after having injured his ankle during
Saturday's 24-18 victory over Argentina.
Nursing a heavily bandaged leg, Carling said: ''My ankle is badly
bruised and quite swollen.''
But the skipper added: ''I am confident of being fit for Sunday, when
we play Western Somoa.''
Carling said his injury was caused when he was trodden on while on the
wrong side of a maul. ''I got rucked out as a consequence of being
trapped on the Argentinian side,'' he said.
England manager Jack Rowell's choice of leader is likely to fall on
Rob Andrew, who is the only other man to captain England since Carling's
reign began in 1988.

Wales 57, Japan 10
WALES opened their World Cup campaign with a 57-10 romp against Japan
in Bloemfontein then proclaimed: ''Bring on New Zealand.''
Mike Hall's men face a massive task in their next Pool C match, in
Johannesburg on Wednesday.
But the skipper insisted: ''We needed to get a win under our belts and
we're all looking forward to the next game.''
Gareth Thomas was the toast of Wales after having marked his
international debut with a hat trick of tries. The Bridgend wing, the
youngest member of the party at just 20, might have been wearing his
country's green change kit, but he certainly had a red-letter day as the
courageous Japanese side were convincingly beaten.
Thomas came to South Africa as a centre but the youngster showed no
sign of nerves out on the left wing. He scored two tries in the space of
four minutes either side of half-time and completed his hat trick with a
50-yard race to the line six minutes from the end.
Welsh coach Alex Evans heaped praise on Thomas. ''What an outstanding
debut for him,'' said a highly satisfied coach.
''He is 6ft 3in and 15st 11lbs, and is something Wales have been
looking for a long time. He has a big future.''
Thomas was not the only one to celebrate his first cap in style, with
scrum half Andy Moore scoring the first of the seven tries.
''Andy has been around a long time and I thought he played superbly
and controlled the game well,'' said Evans.
Also re-writing the record books were Neil Jenkins and Ieuan Evans.
Jenkins contributed 22 points with the boot to push his national record
up to 380, while Evans swooped for two tries, giving him 23 in
international rugby.
''We were a bit rusty to begin with, but I thought we came together
and played well in the end,'' added Hall.
''Neil Jenkins' kicks settled us down early on when we needed it and,
although I thought we gave the ball away too much, I thought some of our
tries were very well constructed.''
While Japan managed to salvage a measure of pride in the final
quarter, it was decisively Wales' day. After the New Zealand clash they
face Ireland, also in Johannesburg, on June 4.
If they can reproduce the form shown in their first match, they will
fancy their chances of qualifying for the quarter-finals.

SOUTH Africa rest 11 of the side which defeated Australia for their
next pool A match against Romania at Newlands, Cape Town, tomorrow.
Only wingers James Small and Pieter Hendriks reappear in the same
positions they occupied against the Wallabies, with the captaincy going
to No.8 Adriaan Richter.
Team manager Morney du Plessis said the decision to rest players had
been taken before the start of the tournament and he reported no injury
problems.
Du Plessis said skipper Francois Pienaar, who is among those rested,
had reminded the entire squad they still faced a huge task if they
wanted to win the World Cup and cautioned against over-confidence.
''All we've done is set ourselves up for more pressure and a bigger
fall,'' he said. ''It'll take a couple of days to knock them down to
where we want, but there's no undue cause for concern that they're going
to lose their heads.''
* FRANCE have named a revamped team for their second Pool D match,
against minnows Ivory Coast on Tuesday in Rustenburg.
Coach Pierre Berbizier has retained only five of the side who looked
sluggish on their way to an unconvincing 38-10 win over Tonga in their
opening game on Friday.
Promising hooker Marc de Rougemont will make his international debut
and Sebastien Viars returns at full back at the expense of Jean-Luc
Sadourny.
Several first-choice players, including veteran centre Philippe Sella
and powerful lock Olivier Merle, were left out but should be back for
France's clash with Scotland next Saturday in Pretoria.
''I'm not worried about the score but I expect a consistent showing
and I hope the players will respect the basic principles of the game,''
said Berbizier.
* WESTERN Samoa will field an new-look forward line-up for tomorrow's
crunch Pool B clash with Argentina in East London.
The Samoans have made three changes and one positional switch to their
pack to face the Pumas, who ran England close in their opening match on
Saturday.
Pat Lam comes in at No.8 and Shem Tatupu, who played in that position
in their opening 42-18 drubbing of Italy on Saturday, moves to
blind-side flanker in place of Sila Vaifale, who is struggling with a
calf strain.
Potu Leavasa comes in at lock and George Latu at prop, while lock
Daryl Williams and veteran prop and captain Peter Fatialofa were being
moved to the replacements.

NATIONAL stadium officials are delighted with the response to the
launch of the Hampden Debenture scheme, which will play a vital role in
the final stage of the stadium. More than 2000 enquiries for further
information have been received within the first seven days.
Austin Reilly, the National Stadium director, said: ''We have
witnessed a significant response from both fans and companies alike, and
many are keen to look at the possibility of having more than one
debenture seat -- one such request concerns 100 seats -- within what
will be a new 17,500 capacity South Stand.
''We are about to embark into a second major stage of advertising for
the scheme and we are looking to a further positive reaction next
week.''
The Hampden Debenture scheme has the full backing of the SFA and the
Scottish League and those buying a debenture seat will be guaranteed the
right to buy tickets for all Scottish internationals and the major cup
semi-finals and finals played at the stadium.

IF HAMPDEN was awash with emotion after the ending of the great famine
of the nineties, three Celtic men had more reason than others to look
around with particular poignancy.
Pat Bonner, Paul McStay, and Peter Grant have been through it all, the
disappointments, the perennial boardroom rows, the regular changes of
manager, and the continual frustration of the fans. Each has a tale of
his own to tell of the past six years, but now they can all add a happy
ending.
Bonner ought not to have been there at all. The Irish international
keeper was given a free transfer by Celtic a year ago and was
considering where he might go to finish off a long and memorable career.
Instead, the decision taken by Lou Macari was rescinded by his
successor, Tommy Burns, and Packie, as he is universally known, returned
to the fold after about a month as a former Celtic player.
Bonner was second choice to Gordon Marshall to begin with, but in due
course, almost inevitably, regained his first-team spot and is once
again on his folk-hero dais at Parkhead. ''I am still here,'' he said
with a happy, and maybe a touch defiant, grin, ''and it has been an
amazing season for me. To think I was gone a year ago, to be back for
this day, to win something we have wanted for six years is fabulous.
''I have had some wonderful times with Celtic and Ireland, but this
was so important for the club and the fans, that it does give me special
satisfaction. It is important personally because, you never know, it
might be one of my last big occasions.''
Bonner has no intentions, however, of making that Hampden victory his
valedictory show. He will be back for more next August. He was 35 last
week but in goalkeeping terms that is not necessarily pensionable age.
''I was talking to Billy McNeill during the week and he was reminding
me how he had regretted packing it in when he did,'' added Bonner. Oddly
enough, that followed the 1975 Celtic win over Airdrie in the Scottish
Cup final, but McNeill's words, rather than his example, will be heeded
by the Irish internationalist.
Bonner, like the two other long-serving Celtic men, was anxious to
point out that, while they had waited all this time to enjoy another big
winning day out, there were players in the current side who were lifting
their medals in their first season with the club. Phil O'Donnell, bought
from Motherwell for #1.7m last September.
Tosh McKinlay, who joined them from Hearts for #350,000 last November,
and Pierre van Hooydonk, who came from NAC Breda in January for #1.2m,
struck it lucky right away, while young players who have established
themselves from the reserves, Brian McLaughlin and Simon Donnelly, have
had that rare privilege of winning first time up.
For Paul McStay, that winning feeling was not new, but it was his
first in a major tournament as the team leader and maybe that is even
more monumental than collecting you own medal. ''I have been up there
many a time picking up a medal, but I always thought it would be a dream
come true to lift the trophy as captain. Now I have achieved that.''
McStay never needs much motivating, but the memory of his missed
penalty which secured the Coca-Cola Cup for Raith Rovers in November has
been very much a torment in his mind, however much he played it down. If
he felt it deeply, he knows that the Celtic supporters suffered for him
just as much as themselves.
''I think they know what the club means to me,'' he said. ''They know
I am one of them. I used to stand on the terracings myself and was
miserable when things went wrong, happy when it went right. That day at
Ibrox I tried to make things right, but it just didn't happen. They felt
for me and I felt for them. Now we are all happy.''
McStay and team-mate Tommy Boyd will be going into hospital for ankle
operations and will miss Scotland's European Championship trip to The
Faroes. ''I feel no pain at the moment,'' said the captain.
Pain is something Peter Grant has got used to, both mentally and
physically, in the six years since Celtic last won a trophy, but even he
did not really think he would defy the odds and recover from the knee
injury he sustained in the last league game of the season.
''He was very worried about it, even in Milan last week,'' said
McStay, ''but as days went by he could feel himself improving and if
there is one man you want on your side when it is a battling game, like
the final, he is the one.''
Grant, man of the match in which he didn't think he would play, might
have been the most emotional of them all, but he usually is, anyway. The
midfielder, who missed the Coca-Cola final because of injury, found it
all too much at times. ''He is a wee hard man, but he is also very
emotional,'' was Bonner's description.
The man himself excused the tears thus: ''I knew Gazza was coming, so
I cried first.''
He confessed he had felt the relief of winning a trophy overwhelming,
especially on behalf of the players who had been at the park for the
past half-a-dozen years. He admitted that, when he lay on the field at
Tannadice holding his face after suffering that leg injury, he feared
the worst. ''I was holding my face not so much from the pain of the
injury but the realisation that I would miss the final.''
He was in pain for the last six minutes on Saturday. ''I took the same
injury again and it was very difficult to last out. I asked Brian Scott
how long there was to go, but I think he was kidding me. It took a long
six minutes. Still, I'll be able to rest all summer and look at my
medal.''
He and his two fellow seniors agreed that, however sweet, the cup win
has to be no more than a starter. ''We are all going back to Parkhead
next season, new board, manager, and players. We know it will be
difficult, because Rangers are the yardstick, deservedly so, but that is
what we have to aim for.''
Most of this was beyond the ken of the Dutchman, Pierre van Hooydonk,
who has heard of the Parkhead troubles only at second hand, but the new
man has every intention of being part of the revolution in any case.
''This is the biggest moment in my career,'' said the sole goalscorer of
the afternoon, ''and I feel I have played my part in winning the cup. I
played in every game except the semi-final replay.''
Pierre took a gamble, sanctioned by the manager, by playing at all, as
he had suffered a slight recurrence of the hamstring problem which had
kept him out of the team recently. ''I knew it could happen again at any
time but I had scored a goal by the time it did. Now I want to look
forward to playing in Europe.''

THE best teams won in the final of The Herald Seven-A-Side football
competition for under-12s, played before the Scottish Cup final at
Hampden on Saturday.
John Ogilvie High of Hamilton, and Peebles High from the Borders,
literally could not be separated, even after a penalty shoot-out which
followed a keenly-fought match, which, despite the stakes, was played in
a sportsmanlike fashion by both teams.
John Ogilvie High opened the scoring in the first half, but with less
than a minute to go, Peebles High deservedly equalised.
The match was to be settled by penalties, but both sides maintained a
100% record, with the takers -- including both goalkeepers -- showing
great aplomb as they put their spot-kicks away.
As they were still going at it when the Airdrie and Celtic players
came on to the park for the big final, Mr Iain Forbes, managing director
of Caledonian Newspapers, publishers of The Herald, decided they should
share the trophy.
John Ogilvie High won the toss to keep the trophy for the first half
of the year, after which it will be passed on to Peebles High.
Mr Forbes, who presented the trophy to both winners, said: ''The
Herald is pleased to encourage the small-sided game, which has been
shown to improve skill levels and engender a sense of sportsmanship and
fun among the boys and girls who take part.
''I am delighted that so many teams from all over Scotland took part
in the competition.
''We had two excellent finalists, one of whom, of course, came from
the rugby-playing part of the world.
''Both teams showed good passing skills and played the match in the
right spirit. They were a credit to their schools.
''I would say there were more shots at goal in the 20-minute final
than there were in the 90 minutes between Airdrie and Celtic.''
A full report of the match and a selection of pictures will appear in
the next issue of Schools Herald, to be published on Tuesday, June 13.

Bristol Rovers 1, Huddersfield 2
HUDDERSFIELD'S Andy Booth scored his thirtieth goal of the season and
then set up Chris Billy's late Wembley winner -- but he already knew it
was his lucky day after girlfriend Cheryl won #10,000 on the Instant
Lottery.
Booth, coveted by Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool among others,
steered Huddersfield into the Endsleigh League first division with an
all-action display which stunned luckless Bristol Rovers in the play-off
final.
''I'm having the time of my life,'' he said. ''I've scored 30 goals
this season, got a place in the England Under-21 squad, and now helped
Huddersfield to promotion. It just had to be today after my girlfriend
won the lottery prize.
''Obviously I'm ambitious and want to play at the top level, but it
would be very nice if I could do so with Huddersfield.''
Booth struck in 45 minutes with a header, but Marcus Stewart equalised
moments later. However, Billy's 15 minutes of fame arrived to end
Huddersfield's fine season on a high.

THE board of directors of Wallets Marts, the Castle Douglas auction
firm which is at the centre of a takeover battle, is recommending
rejection of the latest #12 a share offer from James Craig of Ayr.
After a meeting with financial advisers yesterday, the board said the
offer by Craig is inadequate and continues to seriously undervalue
Wallets.
Spokesman Tom Gillespie said shareholders should do nothing at the
present time following the increased offer announced on Friday which
values Wallets at #l.5m.

SCOTLAND midfield player John Collins won his first medal since having
joined Celtic in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden on Saturday and may
now be moving from the Glasgow club, writes Ken Gallacher.
Collins cost Celtic #1m when he was signed from Hibs five years ago at
a time when Rangers also tried to persuade the player to go to Ibrox.
Now, it seems he is poised to move on once more and two English clubs
are ready to battle it out for his signature in a deal which could be
worth #3m to the Parkhead club.
It is beleived that Middlesbrough have made a positive move for the
player, but their valuation of around #2m would not be enough to prise
him from Parkhead.
However, Everton manager Joe Royle has been alerted to the situation
and he might be ready to up the ante for a player who has been vital to
both Celtic and Scotland over the past few years.
Collins will be with the Scotland squad this week as they begin their
preparations for the European Championship clash with the Faroe Islands.
He is the sole Celt who will be with Craig Brown's men after call-offs
by Paul McStay and Tom Boyd.
Collins, himself, has acknowledged the interest from the south and
admitted: ''The Scottish Cup final may have been my last match for
Celtic.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, of course, has an embarrassment of
midfield riches. As well as Collins he has club captain Paul McStay,
Peter Grant and the club's biggest signing, Phil O'Donnell, who was
bought from Motherwell for #1.7m, but has been unable to command a
regular first-team spot.
On Saturday at Hampden, he was on the bench until sent on to take over
from Simon Donnelly 20 minutes from the end.
He has the potential to take over from Collins and a transfer deal
which could net around #3m would help Celtic finance some of the other
deals they have in mind.
Burns still wants to sign the Russian, Dimitri Radchenko, from Real
Santander, and Belgian internationalist Marc Degryse, from Anderlecht.

Airdrie 0, Celtic 1
WHEN the Celtic team bus left Hampden after the Scottish Cup final it
travelled back to Celtic Park using the same route as the late Jock
Stein chose when he ended the club's trophy famine back in l965.
Now, Tommy Burns and his present day squad of players will hope to
follow Stein's route to success sparked by that victory over Dunfermline
30 years ago.
The bus travelled through the Gorbals, through Calton and on to the
ground and many of the class of '65 were there to celebrate with the men
who had ended a barren spell for trophies which had lasted for six long
years.
It mattered little to any of those involved in the celebrations that
the final had been instantly forgettable as any kind of a soccer
spectacle. All that counted for the Glasgow club was that the failure
which had haunted the club for too long had gone.
Burns knew his team had not played the football he had hoped for. But
he knew, too, how nervous his men had been. They had gone out on to
Hampden carrying with them a huge burden of responsibility. For
themselves, for the manager, for the club and, above all, as Burns so
often reminds them, for the supporters.
Less than 30,000 of them were able to find tickets for the match
itself. Many were still hunting around the city looking for the
priceless briefs on the morning of the game.
But, afterwards, on that famous route back to Parkhead, followed by so
many triumphant teams before them, the support turned out, lining the
streets to salute a success which meant so much to so many.
The goal hero, Pierre van Hooydonk, could scarcely believe what that
first-half header had meant to the Celtic support.
He had been injured before the match and had to limp off after playing
only 39 minutes. But when he placed a header from a Tosh McKinlay cross
beyond the despairing figure of John Martin in the Airdrie goal, he had
made the most significant contribution of the game.
Afterwards, the Dutchman pointed out: ''I came here with three
ambitions when Celtic bought me. I wanted to score goals, I wanted to
help the club win a major trophy, and I wanted the chance to play in
Europe.
''Now, all of that has happened in the final of the Scottish Cup. I
could not be any happier than I am now. It is wonderful for all of us to
be a part of this. Now, we can look forward to the European Cup-winners'
Cup next season.''
Burns had decided to gamble with van Hooydonk's fitness only on the
morning of the game. And he took a chance too, with midfield player
Peter Grant who had been carried off against Dundee United at Tannadice
during the last game of the league season.
Again, on a day which belonged to Celtic, things worked out for Burns
and the man he has praised so often this season as the most influential
player at the club.
In this final it was Grant who kept encouraging those around him to
even greater efforts when that solitary one goal lead looked, on
occasions, to be too fragile to last.
It was Grant who put more effort into the game than anyone else. Even
though he was still suffering some effects from the injury, the longer
the game wore on he went through any personal pain barrier without
flinching for even a second to win himself the man-of-the-match award.
Those of Grant's detractors should run and rerun any videos of this
game to acknowledge the qualities that he brings to the team. He does
not have the vision of Paul McStay, nor the skills of John Collins, but
he can supply the grittiness and determination to the midfield which
allows these two room to play.
Against Airdrie, neither McStay nor Collins was able to capitalise on
the hard work and the combativeness which Grant brought to the game.
Before the match, Airdrie were the team who were supposed to have the
snarling midfield players who would upset the more talented opposition.
None of their players were able to out-snarl Peter Grant and, for that
alone, he deserves more recognition from the Celtic support than he gets
at present.
Burns sees in Grant a love for the club which he, himself, shares.
There is no doubt that throughout the traumatic season Grant, when
available, has been the first name pencilled on to the team sheet by the
Celtic manager.
This final demonstrated why this has been the case.
For Airdrie and their manager, Alex MacDonald, this was a day of
disappointment. Heading for Hampden their main objective must have been
to stifle Celtic's creative players and to prevent the premier division
side scoring an early goal. They succeeded in the first to some extent
-- but failed miserably in the second.
When that goal went in there was never any realistic hope of the
Lanarkshire club being able to emulate the Coca-Cola victory Raith
Rovers had over Celtic at Ibrox earlier in the season.
It was almost as if this team of experienced, hard-nosed professionals
had frozen in that early part of the game and by the time they had
regrouped it was too late for any revival.
Celtic have now broken the psychological barrier which has caused them
so many problems in the past six years. But they should not be deluded
by this trophy win -- and I am certain Burns knows that -- because they
need more players if they are to use this victory as a springboard to
further success.

<HEADLINE>Soil analysis is best way when deciding on fertiliser</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<FLAG>COLLEGE COMMENT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>978157744</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RECENT research has highlighted the advantages to both grass and
animal nutrition of carrying out analysis of grass for certain mineral
elements. Soil analysis is still the main way for farmers to decide on
amounts of phosphate, potash and fertiliser to apply. Analysis of fresh
grass should be viewed as complimentary to soil analysis and as a means
of achieving greater precision in grassland nutrition.
Sulphur
Sulphur is a major nutrient required by plants in approximately the
same quantity as phosphorus. Until the early 1980s, sulphur deficiency
was rarely found because atmospheric pollution, mainly from industry,
supplied sufficient sulphur for crop needs. Sulphur emissions have been
much reduced in Scotland, and some crops, especially grass for silage,
give worthwhile yield responses to sulphur fertiliser.
Sulphur deficiency varies in severity and depends on the amount
deposited from rainfall, winter sulphate leaching, soil type, use of
organic manures and cropping. Deficiencies are most likely on
intensively cut silage land, especially on light soils in all parts of
Scotland and also on some medium soils.
Unnecessary and excessive use of sulphur fertilisers should be avoided
since this could precipitate copper deficiency in susceptible animals.
Grass analysis is the best way of confirming a sulphur deficiency.
Potassium
Recent trials have demonstrated the need for adequate potash in
achieving the maximum yield of grass silage. On responsive sites, the
average yield benefit at first cut from applying the optimum level of
potash was an extra 4 t/ha of fresh grass which can be valued at #80.
In all of these experiments grass analysis was a good check on whether
the right amount of potash had been applied. Getting the potash
fertiliser right on grass can be important for other reasons.
Applying higher than optimum rates of potash commonly results in
''luxury uptake''; grass has a higher potassium concentration and a
slightly lower magnesium content than normal. This represents a waste of
potash and with grazing animals may also aggravate dietary disorders
such as Hypomagnesaemia (staggers).
Magnesium
Grasses and clovers seldom exhibit symptoms of magnesium deficiency
and a reduction in growth due to magnesium is very unlikely. However, an
adequate magnesium content of herbage is important for the nutrition of
grazing animals. Hypomagnesaemia means a low level of magnesium in the
blood and occurs when ''available'' magnesium in the diet does not meet
the requirements for growth, pregnancy or lactation.
Common risk situations for staggers are when lactating dairy cows or
ewes are grazing intensively fertilised lush leaf spring or autumn grass
or cows fed predominantly silage intensively fertilised with nitrogen
and potash.
The two main methods for preventing staggers are the use of dietary
supplements of magnesium and the application of magnesium compounds of
fertiliser to pasture to raise the grass magnesium content.
The risk of staggers involves many nutritional and environmental
factors but analysis of magnesium and potassium in grass can be used to
identify any nutrient imbalances that may increase the risk.

I HAVE to tell you you that the farmer is the subject of a steward's
inquiry. It is really most embarrassing and I wasn't going to tell you.
But who would read a diary in which only the successes were recorded?
It would never have happened if I hadn't decided to take up cycling.
That would have been a smart move if it was taking the bike down to
the pub rather than hazarding the licence. But that's not what I have
embarked on.
You see I have raked out an old racer that must have belonged to one
of the Wasting Assets when they were younger, and joined the Ythan
Wheelers. I have put my foot on the bottom rung a ladder at the top of
which is the maillot jaune in the Tour de France or the gold medal at
the Olympic games.
You could be excused for thinking that I had left this endeavour a bit
late but the truth is that I have wasted at least half my total energy
in sport since first I got into the school football team 48 years ago.
After too long at that sort of ball game, and after becoming good
enough at tossing the caber to get my photo in the papers, I became so
overcome with arthritis in my knees that I had to stop.
In my forties I discovered that with the aid of a skilfully controlled
limp I could protect my worst knee sufficiently to allow me to train for
and complete several marathons.
Now, it is easy enough for these crackshots you see on the telly to do
a marathon. They do the 26 miles in little more than two hours. But the
middle-aged farmer, on the starting grid at 16 stone, is fully four
hours from the home straight.
Before the farmer was 50 even the slowest and shortest of trots became
impossible. That seemed to be that. A sporting life seemed to be over.
Terminal decline had apparently set in.
It was an advert in the local Sqweek that gave me the idea of trying
the bike. The Ythan Wheelers were advertising for new blood. There was
no mention of just how new this new blood had to be so I decided to try
it. A wee run on the bike the night before the first ten mile race
showed that the pedalling put no strain at all on the arthritic joints.
After the race my unfit body was sore all over -- except on the knees.
The muscles ached but the joints were untouched.
Hallelujah! The farmer's infatuation with sport can continue.
I was last of course. The winner took 24 minutes and I just managed to
beat 40 minutes.
By the next race I had improved quite a lot technically. That means I
didn't once have to stop to put my chain back on. It comes off nowadays
if you back-pedal as we used to have to 40 years ago when first we got
three-speed gears. I was down to 37 minutes and becoming subject to
speed-thrill, though still last.
Which brings us to last Sunday morning when I was due to be first off
at seven o' clock.
That suits me fine because with 45 competitors leaving at one minute
intervals the best cyclist (who starts last) would have to arrive before
he had started if he were to overtake a 37 minute man like me. I was
bound to be home at least seven minutes before him.
All the same I did my best to foul up that advantage. You are supposed
to appear with a clean bike and I was still cleaning mine when I should
have been at the start. In a flurry of officials I finally made the off
50 seconds late -- and that delay was to prove important.
Soon the crackshots were speeding past me as usual, but all was not
well. I was uncomfortable. In forty eight years of competitive sport I
have never before started at 7am unless you count the time I competed
for the Caber tossing championship in Australia.
They said it was 5pm but I knew fine it was 5am in Scotland where it
counts. I knew my geography even then.
What was worst was that I have a very excitable digestive system which
needs attention at about 7.30am. And then, in the excitement, I had
forgotten to start the stop watch on my on-board computer, so I had no
idea where I was. Anyway I finished and slunk off home to waken the
Breadwinner with an encouraging cup of tea.
I had hoped to hear no more of that days race, but that was not to be.
The phone rang that evening. ''You went off without your prize.''
It took me only a few seconds of breathless excitement to modify my
guess to there being a booby prize.
''Correct.''
''What was it?''
''Seven pounds.''
''Magic!''
Well not really. Bang goes my chance of an Olympic Gold Medal. Bang
goes my amateur status. My pinnacle will have to be the Tour de France.
''And do you want the bad news? They're accusing you of cheating. If
you hand't started the race 50 seconds late you wouldn't have been last
and somebody else would have won the #7. What some folk will do to get
their name in the paper.''
I have always know that the race was not always to the swift or the
battle to the brave. Now it appears that the same applies at the other
end. The spoils of defeat may be denied even to the slow and the
cowardly.

<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978157746</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FARMERS and growers may get to know about national aids in other
countries before British Government officials and Ministers, it has been
admitted.
Michael Jack, Junior Agricultural Minister, told the Commons
Agriculture Committee it caused him great embarrassement when he found
growers were the first to gain such information.
The problem was compounded by the fact that while some of these aids
might be illegal, others were agreed bilaterally with the European
Commission which then appeared to treat the matter as confidential.
He agreed there was a need for more transparency in the system and
that member states should play by the rules. Equally there was a clear
need for reform of the European fruit and vegetable regime to make it
more market orientated. This was being resisted primarily by Southern
European countries.
Britain had a particular problem in that only about 25% of
horticultural produce went through co-operatives. Mr Jack said that
Britain was urging the Commission to accept there were other forms of
marketing organisation that may require assistance, if assistance
schemes were needed at all.
The Government was also trying to persuade the Commission there was a
need for more rapid reaction in fixing minimum import prices on soft
fruit from Eastern European countries -- ''one that works almost on a
consignment by consignment basis''. The Commission was currently in
negotiation with these counrties.
Mr Jack said that he had great sympathy for soft fruit growers in
Scotland and elsewhere who had seen their markets disrupted by these
imports in recent years. However, Eastern European countries had also
seen the market diluted by their attempts to earn hard currency and
needed to be persuaded this was the wrong approach.
A suggestion by Ann Winterton that British growers faced further
unfair competition through the high cost of pesticide approval and
registration was rejected by Mr Jack.

<HEADLINE>Murdoch hopes for Italian deal in three months</HEADLINE>

Rome, Sunday -- International media king Rupert Murdoch today said he
hoped a deal to buy television channels belonging to former Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi would be settled within the next three
months.
Mr Murdoch told Italian daily newspaper La Stampa that no price for
the television networks had been set yet, although several had been
discussed.
The Australian-born tycoon, whose News Corp has interests worldwide,
visited Rome last week for talks with Mr Berlusconi.
Any deal will have to wait until a June 11 referendum when Italians
decide if private companies should be limited to just one national
network, forcing the $7000m-a-year Fininvest to sell two of its three
stations.
Mr Berlusconi built up Fininvest to become the only domestic rival to
the state-owned RAI network.
Mr Murdoch has said he wants to buy from Fininvest whatever the result
of the referendum, but on Sunday he showed he would prefer to gain
control of all three stations.
''Our intention is to take all three channels. If the referendum
allows it we'll keep the three channels together and look for an Italian
partner to come in with a maximum stake of 49%,'' Mr Murdoch told La
Stampa.
Mr Murdoch said he no had plans to change the programming of the
channels -- Network Four, Channel Five and Italy One -- which consists
mainly of game shows, soap operas, and sales promotions by television
stars.
''The first thing to do will be to find a partner and the second will
be to find someone to take control of the whole operation. I want to
keep Berlusconi's managers but I need someone to replace Berlusconi and
it has to be an Italian,'' he said.
Mr Murdoch said on Friday he did not want Mr Berlusconi as a partner.
Asked whether Italian car manufacturer Giovanni Agnelli, whose family
also owns La Stampa, would be a possible partner candidate, Mr Murdoch
replied:
''I don't believe he would be interested. I think he's already busy
with Fiat. But naturally if he wants to enter he will be accepted. We
want important Italian partners and if we don't find them we will go
public within a year or two.''
Mr Berlusconi, whose centre-right government fell after seven months
in power, has long promised he will sell his television companies to end
a debate over a conflict of interests between his media holdings and his
political life.
News Corp, whose interests range from the celebrated 20th Century Fox
film company to several UK national dailies, is flush with cash after a
joint venture with MCI Communications, the US telecommunications giant,
that will yield it $2000m. -- Reuter

LAST December, President Bill Clinton sat down with leaders from North
and South America and the Caribbean in Miami -- Communist-governed Cuba
was excluded -- to discuss the political and economic future of the
region. Mr Clinton lent effusive support for the creation of a
hemisphere-wide trading union early next century.
The pact, when completed, would form the biggest trading bloc in the
world and the US president won approval for the idea from the more than
30 leaders at the table. However, as many of the Latin American and
Caribbean politicians know from experience, transforming American
pledges on economic union into deeds is easier said than done.
Mr Clinton's concept is not a novel one. A similar idea was mooted by
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s but the Second World War intervened and
it was dropped. In the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson brought it up again at the
Inter-American conference at Punta del Este. But LBJ's domestic War on
Poverty and the Vietnam conflict took priority and the trade deal with
Latin America was forgotten. George Bush picked it up when he was
president but he was toppled from power and that brings us back to Mr
Clinton.
He may well feel that he can pull it off but it isn't going to easy
for the current president to get any hemispheric trade deal passed by
Congress. The Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by
nationalistic right-wing Republicans who have just fought a bruising
battle over America's membership in the World Trade Organisation -- the
successor to GATT -- and they are in an ugly mood. The peso crisis in
Mexico has only added to the disquiet on Capitol Hill.
An indication of the climate -- fair or foul -- in Washington will
become apparent after June 7 -- the date when ministerial-level talks
are scheduled to begin on Chile's bid to become a member of Nafta -- the
North American Free Trade Agreement that includes the US, Canada, and
Mexico.
The Americans will not grant Chile -- the long, sword-like country at
the bottom of South America -- ''fast-track'' consideration of its
membership to join Nafta. This means that the congressional approval
process could drag on for years without any firm conclusion. If this
happens it would send a message to Latin American countries that the
United States does not take them seriously as partners.
This point was hammered home by Andres Velasco, an adviser to the
Chilean Finance Ministry who testified recently before the Clinton
administration's inter-agency trade policy staff committee.
He said: ''Chile has become the cornerstone for the Free Trade
Agreement of the Americas.''
Chile has already found one friend -- Canada, America's biggest
trading partner. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has warmly
welcomed Chile's Nafta application and during a recent visit to Santiago
he went out of his way to offer his country's support. Mr Chretien, once
an inveterate opponent of Nafta, sees the expansion of the free-trade
agreement to Latin America as a way of strengthening the nascent
democracies on the continent and as a counter-balance to US economic
power.
Expansion of Nafta southward makes sense and Chile's application will
be a test of Mr Clinton's resolve and the US Government's professed
sentiment in favour of free trade.
Chile demonstrated its political stability and economic prowess during
the Mexican crisis earlier this year. While the peso devaluation and the
near-collapse of equities on the Mexican bolsa sent shock waves through
many Latin American economies, Chile was bouyant with investment, had
steadily increasing foreign reserves, and reported declining inflation.
Record export earnings have produced a $1000m trade surplus in the
first four months of the current year as a result of high copper and
wood pulp prices and from the country's burgeoning wine industry. Along
with trade earnings, Chile is attracting dollars from investors
impressed by the prospects of long-term economic growth. In his State of
the Nation address last week, President Eduardo Frei forecast 6% growth
in Gross Domestic Product this year and 8% inflation. The inflation rate
is perhaps high by British standards, but is one of the lowest in South
America.
Imports of consumer and capital goods are rising but these have been
offset by investment for new projects, which has totalled $798m in the
first quarter, an increase of about 70% compared with the same period
last year.
Reserves held by the central bank have climbed over the first four
months by $1300m to $14.8bn. This has strengthened the Chilean peso,
which rose to more than 410 to the dollar in February and March but has
since eased to more comfortable levels. The central bank is trying the
stabilise it at around 390-400 to the dollar.
Chile has kept a tight rein on hot foreign money and this has acted as
a deterrent to short-term investors only interested in a fast buck. To
avoid repetition of a painful bust in the 1980s when ultra free
marketeers of the ''Chicago School'' ran economic policy, the government
stipulates that foreign investment must be kept in the country for at
least a year and that 30% of foreign credits have to be deposited with
the central bank -- a vastly different strategy than Mexico's.
Chile has been lucky during the past few years. Soaring commodity
prices have attracted massive foreign investment to the mining sector by
such companies as Australia's BHP, the British RTZ conglomerate, and
Toronto-based American Barrick Resources. A Japanese group headed by
Mitsubishi has invested $1650m in Escondida, soon become the world's
biggest copper mine.
The political stability that Chile regained after the turbulent days
of Marxist President Salvador Allende in the early 1970s and the long
period of political repression under right-wing General Augusto Pinochet
has helped to attract foreign investment.
The general stepped down after a plebiscite in 1989 and the country
made a smooth transition back to democracy in 1990 at the same time as
many other Latin American countries were shaking off the last vestiges
of military dictatorship. Chile, which has a long democratic tradition,
is now governed by a four-party centre-left coalition under Mr Frei.
The present leadership is certain that Chile can sustain its present
success even if its accession to Nafta is stalled or rejected. Chile is
negotiating entry to the Mercosur group, a southern cone trading bloc
that includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. It may also try
to cut a trade deal with the European Union.

IT HAS opened as a contest of considerable inequality. On one side
sits the British Museum. They have 67 pieces, three more than there are
squares on the board, which might be considered greedy.
On the other side sits the Lewis Chess Club, complete novices at the
game, having formed two years ago. They have launched a sharp attack to
recapture the Lewis Chessmen. If the game slips away from them, they are
ready to invoke an old curse.
The Lewis Chessmen, strikingly carved in walrus tusk ivory, are
considered the finest example of a medieval set ever discovered. They
are recognised in photographs and reproduction sets wherever chess is
played in the world.
Believed to be of Norse design and craftsmanship of the twelfth
century, they were found on a Lewis beach in 1831 and purchased for the
British Museum in the same year. For the tyro players of Lewis the
pieces have an iconic significance to rival the Stone of Destiny.
In what may yet become known as the Lewis Gambit, the young club tried
the audacious manoeuvre of brazenly asking their opponent to hand over
his pieces. This is what the chess world calls a tactical novelty,
featuring a completely new move.
No-one had ever thought of asking to be given the Lewis Chessmen
before. No-one dared. Their value today is beyond estimate. It would be
like the Elgin Bowls Club requesting the Elgin Marbles for a game of. .
. well, marbles.
With a membership of 40, a high proportion of them primary school age,
the Lewis Chess Club may lack experience, but they make up for it in
ambition. They see the retrieval of the Lewis Chessmen as a crucial part
of the club's development. Young prodigies such as Jenny Mackay of
Sandwick School are forced to play with facsimile Lewis sets. This is
regarded as nothing short of a denial of birthright.
Thus motivated, club chairman Alasdair Macleod wrote to the British
Museum last month asking to borrow the pieces for an exhibition game. It
would be featured as part of a chess festival in July to coincide with
the loan of the pieces for an exhibition at the newly-opened Museum nan
Eilean at Stornoway.
Not just any exhibition game, either, but one featuring top
grandmasters Nigel Short, of England, and Simen Agdestein, of Norway.
Both have already agreed to play in that month's Lewis Chess Tournament
along with Scottish grandmaster Paul Motwani and the favourite, the
world's leading woman player, Judit Polgar of Hungary.
The players could wear gloves, suggested Mr MacLeod, only marginally
softening the aggressive intent of his surprise move. They could remain
under the continuous scrutiny of security guards.
The game would be played under twelfth-century Norse rules, which
would at least cut the workload for the priceless pieces, since queens
can only move one square diagonally, bishops are restricted to only
eight squares on the board, and pawns forfeit the option of moving two
squares on their first move. And definitely no castling, always a
hazardous operation for the welfare of fragile pieces.
Mr MacLeod's letter continued: ''While we accept the pieces are of
immense historical importance, it is crucial to recognise that they are
chess pieces and retain this functional role. As pieces on the
chessboard, their enormous value and artistic qualities do not compare
with factors such as their freedom of movement and potential for
attack.''
This was a clever offensive, full of subtle implications and veiled
threats. The British Museum took time to ponder its position. The reply,
eagerly awaited by a chess world awakening to an intriguing encounter,
was predicted even by those who struggle to see more than a few moves
ahead. They said: ''No.'' Lewis Gambit declined.
''Not practical,'' apologised British Museum director, Dr Robert
Anderson. ''Old ivory becomes brittle. Moreover, there are faint traces
of colouring which can be detected on some of the pieces and handling
could rub these off completely. It is our responsibility to ensure that
the chessmen survive for as long a time in as good a state as
possible.''
The Lewis Chess Club had already prepared their next move. They played
local Labour MP Calum Macdonald into the centre of the board. ''This is
utterly ridiculous,'' he said. ''Chess is hardly a contact sport.'' He
was right. This game was far more lethal.
The assault met with stonewall defence. It is a matter for the Board
of Trustees of the British Museum, responded the Museums &amp; Galleries
Division of the Department of National Heritage. ''They are in the best
position to comment on the handling of the Lewis Chessmen, which are
important items for our national heritage.''
The latest reply from Lewis Chess Club is one of those moves that
rates a !? from the annotators, indicating either a brilliancy or a
blunder, as yet unclear. Mr MacLeod has invoked what he claims is the
curse of the Lewis Chessmen.
Island tradition has it that there is blood and the stain of treachery
on those pieces. They possess a mysterious history which has always been
part of their fascination.
The carved pieces were discovered in 1831 at Uig Bay on the west coast
of Lewis. They were revealed in a buried stone chamber by the hooves of
cattle in the white sands. A crofter, Calum nan Sprot, was so disturbed
by the frantic expressions on the four-inch figures that he fled from
the scene, convinced he had confronted apparitions from the Celtic
spirit world.
Even to modern eyes they exert a strange charisma, and authorities
have compared their appearance with frenzied ''berserkers''. They look
like petrified miniatures from a medieval battle.
The story continues with the local minister, the Rev Alexander
MacLeod, involving himself with the find. It was he who negotiated the
sale to the British Museum. Experts concluded from the designs that the
pieces were of mid-twelfth-century Viking origin, possibly Icelandic.
This made the 93 pieces among the most important early chess sets ever
found, and they had an additional artistic and historical importance as
relics of the Norse occupation of the Western Isles.
The British Museum bought their 67 pieces for #84. Another 11
subsequently found their way into the collection of the National Museum
of Scotland, in Edinburgh.
The curse attaches to an earlier version of a more violent seizure of
the pieces. Local oral tradition insists that the first encounter with
the pieces was two hundred years earlier when a cattle herd, the Gille
Ruadh, murdered a disembarked sailor boy. He was disappointed with his
plunder, the pieces spilling out of a bundle the boy had been carrying,
and he buried them. In Stornoway he was caught for other crimes and hung
on Gallows Hill.
The discovery this century of the bones of a young boy in a cave near
the landing point at Uig lent possible corroboration.
''There is a lore of death connected with these pieces,'' says
Alasdair MacLeod darkly. ''They are cursed. Calum nan Sprot's reward
from the 1831 sale to the British Museum was #30 -- or thirty pieces of
silver. We want the Lewis Chessmen back on a permanent loan basis.''
Only at this stage does the strategic intent of the Lewis Chess Club
become a little clearer, and it must have shocked the British Museum
when they glimpsed it through the initial tactical skirmishing. This is
a game that is being played for keeps. The plan is for a permanent Lewis
Chessmen Visitor Centre. This is the move that Alasdair MacLeod had been
preparing for a while, to take us into an absorbing middle game.
''The problem is that the pieces are in the care of the British Museum
and belong to the nation,'' he has written in a private briefing
document. ''They must be persuaded to part with them. If it could be
proved that they would be just as secure in the new centre and can be
conserved equally well, it is difficult to see what their objection
might be.''
He goes on to outline his proposed compromise: a long-term loan of the
pieces, or the return of only half of the ''cache''. He adds: ''There is
also the point that Scotland is a separate country. These pieces are
part of Scotland's heritage and should not really be housed in London.''
However, he rules out a ''nationalistic'' strategy as
''counter-productive.'' ''An economic argument is more likely to be
effective,'' he argues. ''Can it be shown that the pieces would generate
more tourism revenue in Lewis than in London? As in a zoo where the
modern visitor expects to see the animals in their normal environment
rather than in cages, I am certain that those interested in the Lewis
Chessmen would prefer to see them in their natural context, their place
of discovery.''
The history of chess has witnessed some lurid forms of conflict above,
below and beyond the board, from allegations of bugged chairs and
poisoned yoghurt to families held hostage, hypnotists in the public
gallery and every conceivable form of psychological warfare. But rarely
can it have observed such a flamboyant and direct attack.
Only the startled faces on the Lewis Chessmen suggest that they have
known anything like it before, in some forgotten medieval power
struggle.

THE DISMAL performance of American airlines is at last showing signs
of improvement, a fact which will be welcomed by British Airways, given
its $400m investment in USAir.
The first quarter of the year is always the most difficult as traffic
falls away after the big build-up to Christmas. Yet big carriers like
United and Delta cut their losses sharply while Northwest increased its
profits. Even USAir, whose future is still in doubt, nearly halved its
deficit.
Now analysts are projecting a surplus for the industry of $500m this
year. However, this is peanuts, particularly beside the $13bn of losses
the industry has sustained over the past five years. The end of the
recession has brought a boom in traffic, with a 6.8% increase in
passenger miles flown inside the US in the first quarter.
If $500m is the best the industry can do when passenger numbers are
climbing it is far from being on the road to prosperity.
Although traffic has been growing, demand has been met by cheap
no-frills local airlines often using old aircraft which can operate with
lower overheads than the larger national carriers which have to maintain
an expensive network.
The majors have responded by cutting costs or at least trying to cut
costs, mainly by reducing their workforces which account for a third of
operating costs.
Some novel approaches have been used. For example, United's employees
agreed to big wage cuts and other concessions in exchange for receiving
55% of the equity in the airline, the world's biggest.
This is the kind of deal USAir hopes to strike with its own workforce
as it desperately needs to get its cost base down. Progress is being
made to get employees to take a pay cut in exchange for profit-sharing
and seats on the board, though BA will view such a radical step as
anathema in a company it is closely associated with.
The US industry is reckoned to need to get its costs down to 7.5 cents
per seat mile to achieve reasonable profitability, but despite the
bloodletting they are still well short of this, with the industry
average at 8.5p even after extensive restructuring. Over-capacity is at
last diminishing as airlines trim their loss-making routes and reduce
their fleets.
In the past, airlines have been too optimistic when passenger numbers
have risen, rushing out to buy the latest shiny new aircraft. This time
they may be more circumspect, at least for a time, and only place orders
when existing aircraft have to be replaced.
It is not actually as simple as this as technological improvements are
coming along all the time and new generation aircraft have lower running
costs, though these have to be balanced against higher depreciation.
Outside North America the industry is gradually becoming more
commercial, though arguments about subsidies continue to rage within the
European Union. The latest crop of hand-outs to European airlines such
as of Air France and Iberia must surely be the last.
State-owned airlines have been weakened in the past through being such
visible emblems of their countries. This has imposed uncommercial
decisions on them and encouraged the culture of dependency on hand-outs.
They are going through the painful process of being exposed to market
forces, though the ultimate freedom of being allowed to be absorbed by a
foreign rival will no doubt be denied them. For this reason it is hard
to see liberalisation of air fares proceeding to the extent of
delivering air fares in Europe as cheap as are taken for granted in the
US.
British Airways has the distinction of being one of the most
profitable in the world, along with Cathay and Singapore Airlines, which
are doing well out the booming Pacific Rim area. BA can afford to
write-off its investment in USAir and for a time this was looking
inevitable. But USAir's fortunes are picking up and it looks more like a
survivor.
This is important to BA's strategy as USAir provides the spokes for
its all-important transatlantic services, feeding passengers into BA
flights with through-ticketing.
BA continues to pay great attention to its cost base but once you are
at the top it is easier to stay there given greater financial
flexibility. So BA can afford to be the first operator of the new Boeing
777 and maintain a younger fleet than financially-strapped rivals.
American airlines are not free of a sort of subsidy, this time from
the private secor. TWA was re-born out of bankruptcy in 1993 and the
same process was applied to America West.
Nor are they totally unprotected as foreign companies are not allowed
to own them. And the US Government gives them more support in
international negotiations than other industries. It is still trying to
strike a deal with the UK beneficial to its carriers.
The industry may yet be bailed out by higher fares given that
over-capacity is reducing, particularly as tighter environmental
regulations are eliminating older aircraft, and subsidies are coming
down worldwide.
But the chances are that should this occur the airlines will blow it
on expensive purchases of new aircraft and the cycle will turn down once
more in several years' time. So it is some comfort to know that the UK
flag carrier is among the best placed of all international airlines.

THE first thing to notice is that the seasons seem to have got ahead
of themselves. The daffodils in the bulb fields are fading and done just
at the time they are beginning to come into bloom further north, while
sea pinks, bluebells, fuschia, and allium are already glorious.
The Isles of Scilly are 28 miles out into the Atlantic off Land's End
and they are another world, nothing between them and America but sea.
There are five inhabited islands. St Mary's is the largest, yet only two
and a half by one and a half miles in total. Hugh Town, the ''capital'',
lies on a strip of land between two beaches.
Most of the hotels look out to beach and harbour, where the boat comes
in from Penzance, and dozens of smaller craft tie up. Above the town,
the Garrison Headland has a great wall circling the old castle, now a
hotel, but first built as a defence against the Spanish. Plus ca change.
Many fishing boats are flying Canadian flags.
The narrow streets of Hugh Town may seem to belong to the past but
then comes the surprise of two banks, all the usual shops, and daily
papers in before 9am, provided the first helicopter flight is not
mist-bound. It is no surprise to find many craft and souvenir shops but
there are also workshops -- grand places for a wet afternoon.
Further north is Tresco, owned by the Dorrien-Smith family, whose
ancestor, Augustus Smith, founded the wonderful Abbey Garden in 1849.
Built on the site of an old twelfth-century priory, deep gulleys and
terraces cut into the hillside where everything grows. Abbey Gardens has
more southern hemisphere plants growing outside than any other garden in
Britain. St Agnes also has an old inn, called the New Inn, which has
recently become wood-lined when a fortuitous cargo of wooden planks
washed ashore.
West of Tresco is the island of Bryher, with the islands' smallest
community. All the islands have been visited and occupied since
prehistoric times, and there are many archaeological sites such as
graves and cairns, as well as traces of old fields to indicate ancient
farming systems. Even tucked down behind the wall, the top of Watch Hill
must have made a blowy outlook point, and a lonely life, but the view is
magnificent and circular.
In autumn, when the Gulf of Mexico boils up into a storm, the wild
wind sweeps American birds over the Atlantic. The birds shelter in the
fields and shrubs as the great waves lash the appropriately named Hell
Bay in the west. In turn, these rare birds bring birders from all
corners of Britain to swell the population. The Isles of Scilly have
their own rarities too, such as the blackbird with a red, not a yellow
beak.
More recent ruins lie on the unmistakable twin-hills of Samson, which
the Tresco boat passes near enough for us to view and marvel at why
anyone should have chosen such an exposed site. Yet people lived on
Samson until around 1850, when the ceaseless struggle on an ungrateful
soil at last drove them away. Now, it is a favourite island for picnics
and birds.
To the west is the gentle island of St Agnes. Its 70-or-so people the
most south-westerly community in the British Isles. Flower farming and
the sea are the traditional occupations, and the small churchyard holds
memorials to many sailors. The light in the little church is the sea
colours of a modern stained-glass window, which commemorates the many
islanders who have died in the seas around St Agnes.
Connected to St Agnes by a sand bar is Gugh (to rhyme with Hugh),
another island no longer inhabited year-round. Up to 1974, it was a
flower farm until the family moved out to St Agnes. Today, there are
traces of the daffodil fields, reminders of the past, and from more
distant times many cairns, entrance tombs, and the Old Man of Gugh.
Lying against this ancient standing stone is said to cure back problems,
but we had no-one with a sore back to test its skill.
Diving, swimming, and most other water sports are popular everywhere,
but nowhere more so than on the North-easterly island of St Martin's,
where the small flower fields lead down to glorious, sheltered beaches,
their safe and shallow rock pools ideal for children. Another attraction
of all the islands is that the local communities are still close, often
putting on their own entertainment to which they welcome visitors.
The great social evenings of these sea-dominated islands are the
pilot-gig races which start in April. They are a legacy from the days
when the pilot boats had to row out fast because the first pilot to
arrive got the job of taking an approaching ship through Scilly's
shallow waters and its rocks and skerries. Today, each island keeps its
old pilot gig, most dating back to around the 1870s, rowed by a crew of
six and a coxswain.
Far more travel to see the races that row in them -- men row on Friday
nights, women on Wednesdays -- and the biggest races are pursued by
every island boat fit for the water, carrying around 400 spectators.
They are in for a great night and a long one, as everyone later repairs
to the local hostelries to celebrate or commiserate. It is the Isles of
Scilly at their most typical.

NOT many Italians know the Argentario; not even many Tuscans, in whose
province it lies, have ever been there. Search for it in vain in the
tourist brochures. This enchanting little circular promontory, linked to
the mainland by three causeways, is too valuable a secret for the
wealthy Romans, who have colonised it for centuries, to share; instead
they keep it protectively for the privileged few.
Powerful dynasties such as the Agnellis, of Fiat fame, have holiday
homes here, and their presence and influence ensure that commercialism,
especially hotel building, is frowned upon so their bolthole remains
unspoiled. Appropriately the area, once an island, was named after their
forebears, the Argentarii, Roman bankers who amassed their wealth by
lending money.
Look for it on a map, 162 miles north of Rome, sprouting from the
mainland like a mushroom with three stalks. The approach is via the
interesting walled Etruscan town of Orbetello, rising like a mirage from
the lagoon. Its quiet squares, ancient cathedral built by the Spanish,
and restaurants specialising in local eels are well worth further
investigation.
Ahead lies the impressive bulk of Monte Argentario, craggy, forested,
terraced for vines, totally dissimilar to the flat mainland. It looks
down on the two delightful little ports, Porto Santo Stefano and
Port'Ercole, which provide all the action. The former has two bustling
harbours.
The more picturesque, the Old Harbour, is in fact a pastiche.
Bombarded during the Second World War, it has been cleverly restored
using the salvaged original materials and now presents a photogenic
facade of archetypal tall Italian houses in saffron, terracotta and
honey, their ground floors occupied by restaurants, gelaterias,
boutiques, and separated from the water by the wide promenade.
The New Harbour, a pleasant walk away around the point, is more
workaday, with shops catering for basic housekeeping. Here the sizable
fishing fleet has its quay. Watching the unloading of the catch,
checking the price and noting the names of the fish still flapping on
the nearby stalls takes care of an educative hour or so. Further round
is the depot for the highly popular ferries to the fairytale island of
Giglio, an hour's excursion no-one should miss.
Giglio takes its name from the lily, but this is not the only flower
to grace time-warped, pollution-free isle. Walk around the high cliff
path or up to the little church to discover tiny gladioli, freesias,
yellow artemisia, all contributing their share of scent and colour to
air already redolent with thyme and rosemary.
Port'Ercole has a sandy beach and lots of boats, from modest dinghies
to glittering yachts, bobbing in the horseshoe harbour, lined with bars
and fine restaurants. High above, the old town is confined by imposing
fortifications. Climb up to the cobbled square, dominated by the
sixteenth-century Spanish governor's mansion, for a fine view and
peaceful strolls through quiet alleys, their darkness relieved by
geranium-filled window boxes.
Because hotel beds are so limited, most visitors rent a villa or
apartment for their holiday. The Italians are blinkered about vacation
dates. Even if it means packed beaches and queues of cars over the
causeways, only six weeks in July and August are acceptable. Which
leaves the best months, in spring and autumn, free for the rest of us.
The Argentario may feel like a world apart, but in fact it is within
easy reach by car, or train from Orbetello, Rome, Siena or even
Florence.
Nearer home, in the hills of the Maremma district, lies the picture
postcard village of Capalbio, once famous for its brigands, and the
three spectacular fortressed tufa-stone towns of Pitigliano, Sorano and
Sovano offer another fascinating insight into southern Tuscany.

<HEADLINE>Terex proves it can scape up healthy profits</HEADLINE>

COMPANIES based outside Scotland often close their factories north of
the Border when the going gets tough. Look at Rolls Royce, which is
about to close its aero engines factory in East Kilbride.
But Terex Equipment Limited (TEL), which makes earth-moving equipment
and giant dump trucks for use in quarries and public works projects, is
living proof that a good Scottish subsidiary can avoid the axe and
prosper.
The US-owned factory in Motherwell survived the death of several of
its competitors during the 1980s -- notably the massive Caterpillar
plant on the other side of town -- and is once again making healthy
profits.
Managing director Bill Buchan sees gross profits rising from #4m last
year to #5m in 1995, with sales growing from #68m to #80m.
Terex exports more than 85% of its output and is betting on a joint
venture in China and a production licencing agreement in India to boost
its sales in the booming Asian market.
The factory employs 600 workers building monster dump trucks that can
carry up to 95 tonnes of ore at a time from a mine face to the nearest
processing plant and giant earth scrapers for building roads.
These scrapers look like massive ice cream scoops suspended between
two tractors and can peel away a foot of topsoil with the ease of a shop
assistant dipping into a tub of vanilla.
Terex produces about 600 of these oversized toys per year -- supplying
about 12% of the world market -- and claims to be the biggest privately
owned company in Scotland.
For much of its life Terex was owned by General Motors, but it was
sold to another US firm, Northwest Engineering, in 1987.
At that time, there was surplus production capacity in the world
market for heavy earth moving equipment and Terex, starved of
investment, was losing money.
The firm also had factories in Brazil and the United States, but its
new US owner decided to close these and save Motherwell.
This came as no surprise to Bill Buchan, even though Caterpillar was
closing its own plant in Motherwell at the same time to concentrate
production in the United States.
''They chose us because they thought we were the best place in the
world for making the best returns and we have proved they made the right
decision,'' said Mr Buchan, who has headed the Motherwell plant since
1991.
''I believe that the unions were more flexible here than they were in
America and they still are,'' he added, noting that Motherwell had lost
only one week's production as a result of strike action in 45 years of
existence.
''The productivity of the Scottish worker was probably better and the
general cost here was lower. Furthermore, the business strategy was to
sell out of Scotland,'' he said.
It was pretty much a case of the baby adopting its parent.
Northwest Engineering, based in Westport, Connecticut, changed its
name to Terex. The group, which also builds forklift trucks, cranes and
other larger models of dump truck in the United States, now trades under
the Terex name worldwide.
Sales from the Scottish plant have increased by an average 10% a year
since 1990 and the factory has been back in profit since 1992.
Terex has invested #9m in robotics and other computerised production
techniques at Motherwell to improve quality and cut costs.
It is in the process of buying its UK distribution company, Imaco, and
has signed two new distribution agreements to get a foothold in the
difficult Eastern European and Japanese markets.
Terex signed a distribution deal with the German firm O &amp; K, a
subsidiary of the Krupp industrial group, to increase its penetration of
Eastern Europe, where O &amp; K benefits from strong German bank finance.
And last month it signed a distribution agreement with Kawasaki to
break into the difficult Japanese market, traditionally dominated by the
local producer Komatsu.
But Mr Buchan sees the biggest potential for growth in China, where
Terex dump trucks have been assembled by a joint venture since 1990.
The market is huge. Just two of China's big infrastructure projects,
the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river and the Xiaolangdi dam on the
Yellow River, employ 160 Terex vehicles.
That is equivalent to more than three months production at Motherwell!
Terex has a 30% stake in the North Hauler heavy vehicle factory at
Baotou, 350 miles north of Beijing, which currently turns out #20m worth
of Terex rigid dump trucks per year.
More sophisticated articulated dump trucks and earth scrapers are
still imported whole from Scotland.
But increasingly the Chinese factory, which enjoys cheap labour costs,
is manufacturing Terex components locally.
Mr Buchan envisages a situation soon when Baotou will be shipping
low-tech components back to Motherwell for the main assembly line.
This raises questions about the long-term future of Terex's
manufacturing operation in Scotland.
Mr Buchan sees the number of employees remaining stable for the time
being, with output growth employing hands made idle by automation and
gains in productivity.
But the long-term future is less certain. Terex has narrowed rather
than broadened its product line and increasingly its vehicles for
fast-growing Third World markets will be built abroad.
''We believe it is the only way to get orders from China and India,''
said Mr Buchan, who has been with Terex in Scotland since 1960.
Demand for earth-moving equipment in most western countries, which
already have well-developed infrastructure, is not expected to grow
much. This could mean that Terex will eventually need fewer workers at
Motherwell.
The company has virtually phased out production of front loaders --
massive tractors with hydraulic scoops in front for loading dump trucks,
but Mr Buchan said it has no plans to produce any new types of vehicle.
Furthermore, he sees a probable downturn in the world market for
earth-moving equipment towards the year 2000 as economic growth slows
down.
Could the axe of down-sizing and rationalisation eventually fall on
Terex in Motherwell after all?
''There is always that possibility,'' Mr Buchan admitted.
But he hastens to add: ''If we as a specific entity have got a good
design, a good production and marketing strategy and if we are making
money, there is not a company in the world that wouldn't want to buy
us,'' he said.
Mr Buchan boasted that Terex's small size gives it a flexibility in
client relations which its larger rivals, Caterpillar, Komatsu, Belaz in
Russia, and the Swedish-Canadian firm Eurclid don't enjoy.
On the other hand, he admitted that Terex lacks the clout to offer
cheap finance or counter-trade deals to cash-strapped buyers in the
vital East European and Third World markets.
''We have had to pay a lot more for export credit insurance since ECGD
(Export Credit Guarantee Department) was privatised and they charge a
lot more than Hermes in Germany,'' he grumbled.

ALLAN McGroarty admits that three months ago he could not have done
this interview. The prospect of talking into a tape recorder to a
journalist would have fazed him, reducing him to a mumble of stuttered
words.
Now, over morning coffee he speaks eloquently about his fight to
obtain speech fluency. He wants to share that experience with others, to
let them know that help is available, that they don't have to live with
their pyschologically crippling affliction.
He knows all about the bad times, the devious behaviour pattern
stammerers adopt to avoid awkward words or situations: ''You give
another name rather than use your own because you know you will stutter
if you use it. Or you go into a restaurant and order a dish you don't
really want, say a ploughman's lunch instead of spaghetti bolognaise
because its easier to say. You go for a job that doesn't bring you into
contact with people so that you won't have to answer the phone or talk
to them.''
Allan knew the whole armoury of avoidance tactics.
Since he was 18 years old Allan, from Partick, Glasgow, has searched
for a cure for his stuttering. He tried hypnotherapy, acupuncture and
traditional speech therapy. Nothing worked. Then Allan heard about the
McGuire Institute in Holland, which charges #400 for a week's course.
Three months ago he went and found himself speaking fluently after the
first morning of the course. ''It was a miracle,'' says Allan.
Speech therapists are more sceptical. They know that sudden cures are
a phenomenon of stammering. While dramatic initially they rarely last.
But as far as Allan is concerned his life has been revolutionised.
Even if he does have a relapse he is confident that now he knows how to
control the ''monster within''. Family and friends are astonished at his
fluency too.
So has Dave McGuire, a 48-year-old American and a former stammerer,
now living in Holland, hit on a method which has so far eluded
professional speech therapists? Or is it just a gimmicky racket with
short term cures?
Basically, he has devised a method based on combining two techniques,
one conventional using non-avoidance, the other more unusual based on
deep breathing exercises.
The first is based on the work of two academics with an international
reputation in speech therapy, Drs Vivian and Joseph Sheehan from the
University College of Los Angeles. They were the first to introduce
McGuire to a way of coping with his stammering using non-avoidance
techniques: ''These people taught me how to accept my stuttering by
deliberate stuttering. I was really bad. I would have five-minute
blocks. I couldn't even say my name. They taught me how to stop avoiding
words and situations. They taught me not to let this monster control my
life.''
While it helped it did not cure him. Then he moved to Holland and did
a speech therapy course developed by opera singer Del Ferro. By the
fifth day he was fluent. His ''monster'' had gone.
''I couldn't believe it. That was 18 months ago.'' So far he has
helped more than 70 other people overcome their stammering with varying
degrees of success.
Allan McGroarty is one of his big success stories: ''He was very
severe. When I heard him speak I thought: 'My God, this is going to be a
challenge.' I reckoned without Allan's determination. Some people are
sprinters and get cured in a matter of hours, others are marathoners and
take longer. Allan turned out to be a sprinter.''
He makes no claims that the method is 100 per cent guaranteed. After
seven months, McGuire himself suffered a minor ''blip'' but he was able
to cure himself using his own techniques. A research study of 18 who
took part in one programme found that more than two-thirds achieved a
high degree of fluency.
Allan says: ''You've got to want to be cured, and be prepared to work
hard.'' But is it not all to do with confidence, self-esteem and
overcoming childhood inhibitions?Allan explains: ''Learning to accept
yourself is important but an equally important step is the physical one.
You have to learn to breathe properly from the depths of your rib cage
and this takes lots of work and practice. Most stammerers are shallow
breathers.''
Allan gives a cautious warning: ''Its not a method for everyone. For
some, like myself, the McGuire method works.''
The initial fee includes access to unlimited courses until fluency is
achieved and a helpline. Allan found this invaluable during the first
few anxious weeks. ''I ran up enormous phone bills to Holland but it was
worth it.''
He likens stammering to an iceberg: ''What others hear is the
stammering but that's only the tip. They don't see the emotional burden
you are carrying around. Everyone needs to speak whether it's asking for
a bus ticket, or answering the phone. You carry around all this fear,
guilt, shame and anxiety underneath the surface.''
The situation is only made worse by perhaps well-meaning attempts to
finish off a sentence for a stammerer.
Tim Shanks, Development Officer with the Association for Stammerers,
points out that as far as speech therapists are concerned the official
line is that there is no cure for adult stammerers.
''People go on weekend courses and appear to be cured. But the stammer
returns.
''On the other hand, we know of several dozen people who have been to
Holland on Dave McGuire's courses and the majority seem to be satisfied
with the results. In the case of Allan McGroarty I would be very
interested to see if he maintains his fluency.
''As far as the association is concerned, because of the history of
short-term cures which do not prove sustainable, we would be more
interested in seeing long-term results.''
In the meantime, Allan's future has never looked brighter: ''It's
opened up a whole new world. I've joined a public speaking club, and
enrolled for university.''

Washington, Sunday -- The top US trade official said it's time to
fight to lower Japanese trade barriers, but critics warned that
punishing the Japanese motor industry could backfire.
''We've got to stand up for American workers,'' US Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor said, defending the decision to impose
punitive tariffs on $5900m worth of Japanese luxury cars unless a deal
is reached to open Japan's markets for American cars and parts.
But two other guests on the same ABC television programme, Democratic
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and former trade representative Carla
Hills, warned that America could get hurt by playing tough with Japan.
Ms Hills said the tariffs, scheduled to go into effect on 13 Japanese
luxury models on June 28, could invite Japanese retaliation.
''I don't think stiffening the backbone of your opponents is the way
to achieve your objectives,'' said Ms Hills, who served under President
George Bush. ''Our objective ought to be very focused, very persistent
but not to lose our cool.''
Senator Bradley said a trade war with Japan would be a ''gigantic
gift'' to Germans, Swedes, and British who would sell more of their
luxury cars in the United States. Meanwhile, ''middle class workers and
dealerships across this country are going to lose their jobs.''
Foreign economic leaders have also condemned the administration
strategy of acting alone before going to the World Trade Organization,
set up under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to settle
such disputes.
''I don't favor the use of threats and the implementation of threats
that are contrary to world trade rules,'' said Sir Leon Brittan, the
European Union's top trade official.
Ms Hills said the US action against Japan erodes the WTO's credibility
''in a very dangerous way . . . when we bully our way through, I think
the damage is very real.'' -- AP

BRITISH firms are being urged to take advantage of major new business
opportunities in the Middle East and South America.
In the Middle East, Lebanon is being seen as a major growth area
following the recent rash of peace deals in the region.
Construction minister Lord Ullswater said the UK has made ''a
commitment'' to the Lebanon and urged companies ''to build on it at
every opportunity''.
He warned UK industrialists at a recent gathering in London: ''If we
do not satisfy demand, someone else will.''
Lord Ullswater visited Beirut last month to re-establish contact with
senior members of the Lebanese Government and study progress in
rebuilding the city devastated by 16 years of civil war.
Among projects he visited was Trafalgar House's flagship site, the
Beirut City Sports Complex, which will stage the Asian Games in 1996.
The visit continued a long-term UK ''promotional strategy'' for the
Lebanon which was launched in 1993 when Sir George Young, then Minister
for Housing and Construction, led the first trade mission to Beirut for
more than 10 years.
Meanwhile Trade Minister Richard Needham is leading a business
delegation on the first visit by a British trade minister to Peru since
1981.
He is also paying a return visit to Colombia where British exports
rose by more than 100% last year.
Before leaving Mr Needham said: ''Peru is a market emerging rapidly
from the depths of recession where there are many glints of
opportunity.''
On Colombia, he added: ''Our exports to that country rose dramatically
from 1993 to 1994 but the many opportunities, in sectors very similar to
Peru, are still significant.''
UK firms are also interested in investing in Brazil, a country where
British companies have long had a foothold. Brazil is going to privatise
several state-owned companies that may prove to be attractive to British
investment. British firms, such as RTZ and some of the water and
electricity companies, are also investing in Argentina and other
countries.

IF Japanese pianist Noriko Ogawa had been fatally distracted during
her weekend celebrity recital at the Perth Festival, the most
unforgiving critic would have made allowances. Ms Ogawa was subjected to
more potential disturbances in a single concert than I have ever
witnessed.
These ranged from a late eruption into the hall (during the hushed
opening movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, no less) of a crowd of
people who, rather than taking the nearest available seat, started
looking round noisily for their allocated places. Rustlers of sweetie
papers were out in force (unleashing their noisiest efforts during the
most discreet of Debussy's Preludes). And some of the continuous and
uncontrolled coughing that went on was almost seismic -- if I had a
coughing fit like some of these, I'd leave the hall, even if I was on
duty.
I don't usually waste precious space on such phenomena, but all this
-- as festival chairman Iain Halliday himself agreed -- was totally out
of order.
That Noriko Ogawa appeared unaffected was a tribute to her
concentration. She is a powerhouse pianist, slender of build, but with
massive strength, unleashed from her shoulders and back, that produces
enormous sound. This was her strong point in Beethoven and a commanding
version of Chopin's Second Sonata. In music requiring delicacy or poetry
-- Debussy's Book One Preludes and Takemitsu's bell-like Closed Eyes --
she was a bit literal, without much sense of shading.
The best was saved till last with a barnstorming version of Liszt's
concert paraphrase of Rigoletto, revealing a quality of panache that had
not been previously in evidence.

An exhibition marking the bicentenary of James Craig's death also
looks to the future, as KATHLEEN RANTELL reports
A DOUBLE life-size figure dressed in a royal blue frock coat, striding
out to seize opportunities and get things done, commands the entrance to
the Dream City exhibition which continues at Edinburgh City Art Centre
until July 1.
George Drummond was born to occupy a plinth. Good legs, a tall figure,
a great hooked nose and jutting chin, this man who was Provost of
Edinburgh for a total of 12 years must have intimidated all
contemporaries. Surely he, or perhaps Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, his
partner in determination to extend the eighteenth-century city across
the North Loch, now Princes Street Gardens, should be regarded as the
father of the New Town rather than James Craig who won the competition
for the lay-out of the first phase of building?
Perhaps not. People with clout to get things done are concerned with
ends not means. ''You will probably live, though I will not, to see all
these fields covered with houses forming a splendid and magnificent
city,'' Drummond told a colleague. The dreams of developers don't
change.
He was right on both counts. Thanks to the simplicity, elegance, and
practicality of Craig's plan for the space now bounded by Princes
Gardens, Queen Street Gardens, and St Andrew's and Charlotte Squares, a
magnificent New Town was created. And the provost did not live to see
The Promised Land to which he had led the city. He died, aged 80, in
1776, the year of the lay-out competition.
Further into the exhibition is another more soberly clad figure of a
man who evidently never dominated anybody, Craig. Full faced, he looks
uncertain, anxious perhaps, about where the next penny was coming from.
He died bankrupt at 51. The exhibition marks the bicentenary of his
death.
In addition a well-illustrated, scholarly paperback on the making of
the New Town James Craig, 1744-1795 published by the Mercat Press at
#9.99, contains new research by nine specialist contributors. A list of
Craig's known projects is complemented by a reprint of his scarce
pamphlet of 1786 ''a plan for the improvement of the city of
Edinburgh''. His concerns have relevance today -- safety of pedestrians,
hygiene in food markets, arcades for shelter -- and he anticipates
future changing needs in the city.
Craig attended a school for the sons of indigent merchants and at 15
started a six-year apprenticeship as a mason which gave him the
rudiments of architecture. Winning the anonymous New Town competition at
the age of 22 gave him a gold medal, the Freedom of the City in a silver
box, and the right to work as a contractor. But he had too little money
to pay workmen and none to go on a grand tour to complete his education.
The assessors sent him back to the drawing board to refine his plans.
Among the alternatives he offered to his own favourite schemes is a
grand circus with a fountain halfway down George Street, a prospect that
could have been attractive. The idea was dismissed, revived by a new
provost, and refused again on the provost's death. The area was built to
Craig's simpler proposals.
After 1781, the year Craig's portrait was painted by David Allan, he
became increasingly frustrated by debt and the following year exchanged
his medal and silver box for a loan of #30. Robert Burns's concern for
Allan, ''has he no patrons; or do ''Poverty's cold wind and crushing
rain beat clean and heavy' on him?'' applied even more aptly to his
sitter.
In the book Charles McKean emphasises the strong Hanovarian tendency
that energised the city's adventurous leap into the New Town land. The
exhibition pays less attention to this except for Craig's grovelling
dedication of his plan to George III, who named the streets.
But the exhibition looks ahead to renewing the  New Town. Proposals
for Princes Street made in 1950 and others made in 1955 are a dire
warning against any change. But at least the newest plans for the space
between existing buildings and the gardens to be filled by pavement
travelator, electric metro-tram, and pollution-free buses powered by gas
and flywheel in that order, are reversible if people don't like them.
More than could be said for the plans of 40 years ago.

THE title of a new tome by American media lecturer Susan J Douglas --
Where The Girls Are: Growing Up Female With the Mass Media -- is
possibly the only unbiased line in the book. A more appropriate title,
which would reflect this author's resentful stance on the subject, would
be Growing Up Feminist Despite the Mass Media.
Douglas has an axe to grind. But her grudge is an understandable one.
As one of the ''baby boom'' generation born in the decade after the war,
she has spent her life being bombarded with images of what behaviour is
expected of her, and what aspirations she should aim to fulfil
(certainly not her own). Her argument, and she lays it on the line from
the word go, is that the 1990s woman is a ''cultural schizophrenic''.
The media, she adamantly claims, has consistently and deliberately
mocked and tried to undermine the women's movement. In so doing, she
says, they have inadvertently made some converts themselves, as
indignant female viewers hurl slippers and expletives at their TV sets
or mumble ''puleeese'' at particularly patronising remarks they hear in
the movies or read in the press. At the same time as we resist the
media, however, we secretly succumb to them: witness the vast industry
-- fuelled by images of the definitive (anorexic and characterless) body
beautiful -- built on selling cellulite creams and anti-ageing
treatments.
Douglas takes us through the changing images of women, and the
evolution of feminism, over the last 50 years -- via the media. When she
was a girl in the 1950s, the prevailing notion of the ideal woman was
the one seen in cosy (and unfunny), American family sitcoms like The
Donna Reed Show with ''their smiling, benevolent, self-effacing,
pearl-clad moms who loved to vacuum in high heels''. Teenage girls, on
the other hand, could take the ''perky'' option: the decade was
positively peppered with apparently dumb and cute, but actually wily,
young females who were pretty in pastel and beloved by everyone. It's no
wonder they weren't taken seriously when they all had ridiculous names
like Gidget or Pinky. The only way these gals could have some degree of
control over their lives was by making their dopey boyfriends and fickle
fathers think that they were making the decisions.
In the 1960s, women -- prompted, initially, by Betty Friedan's
best-selling The Feminine Mystique -- were starting to question their
traditional roles. The American sitcom expressed this burgeoning
rebellion by depicting empowered women as witches (Bewitched) or genies
(I Dream of Jeannie). An empowered and sexually confident woman was seen
as a threat, as Douglas points out: ''A running joke on The Addams
Family had Gomez unable to restrain himself from planting passionate
kisses all along Morticia's irresistible arm . . . her monstrous power
turned him into a helpless, slavering fool.''
A decade of increasing female frustration culminated in the boycott of
the Miss World competition in Atlantic City in 1968. This, and
subsequent feminist protests were -- alleges Douglas -- totally
misrepresented (the ''all feminists are hairy-legged lesbians'' image)
by the still male-dominated media throughout the 1970s, to the point
that younger women were, and often are, reluctant to associate
themselves with the movement despite the fact that they shared the basic
tenets of its credo.
Annoyingly, Douglas looks for chauvinism and the reinforcement of
traditional gender roles in everything. Her sweeping statements
occasionally verge on the paranoid. Nothing is sacred from the wrath of
this first generation feminist, not even cherished Disney films: Peter
Pan's Tinkerbell is, apparently, a ''vain little chorus girl'', Wendy is
a ''servile, masochistic wimp who only wants to wait on boys''.
What Douglas does evoke rather well, if sometimes a bit too
enthusiastically, is the sense of bonding she felt when she and
practically every other adolescent female in the country was caught up
in Beatle-mania. This was their first sense of belonging to a particular
group, and her description of the experience of watching the Fab Four on
The Ed Sullivan Show will ring bells for anyone who's ever been a
teeny-bopper: ''I was elated -- actually filled with joy . . . This was
a happiness I could barely contain, the kind that made me want to shake
my best friend and jump for joy.''
But, for me, the best bit of this entertaining, if one-sided, romp
through recent media history is the segment on 1970s television. My
friends and I -- all being born between 1969 and 1971 -- have gotten
great conversational mileage out of Douglas's surprisingly lenient
analysis of one of the programmes which most influenced us as girls:
Charlie's Angels.
For Douglas, Angels was ''television's most ingenious resolution to
the tension between feminism and antifeminism'' since our heroines were
working, successfully, in what had previously been an all-male domain
(private investigation), but had retained their femininity. For us, it
meant playground games which excluded the boys or involved killing them
off (slowly). Just about everyone I know remembers being a Kris, a Kelly
or a Sabrina. Indeed, the biggest revelation to emerge from debates on
this engrossing, if predictable, study is that some of my contemporaries
were in possession of official Charlie's Angels jumpsuits. Why did
nobody tell me?
* Where The Girls Are: Growing Up Female With the Mass Media, by Susan
J Douglas is published by Penguin, and costs #9.99.

THE only regret about my recent visit to India was that I missed the
Royal Lyceum Theatre's production of The Gowk Storm, adapted from the
novel by Nancy Brysson Morrison, the Glasgow lady whose name raised such
a flurry of interest in this column just over a year ago.
Nancy was one of a remarkable family of five from High Burnside, on
the edge of Glasgow, who all grew up to be distinguished writers in one
genre or another.
Brother Tom, for example, who started as a reporter on The Herald, was
a considerable novelist but became best known as leading screenwriter at
Elstree Studios, with films like Ice Cold in Alex to his credit.
Sister Peggy gained fame in America under her pen-name of March Cost,
while Mary's forte was the short story. Indeed, the three sisters
tempted description as a Scottish version of the Brontes, who were the
subject of one of Nancy's books.
But ''the writing Morrisons'', as they were known, had gone so far out
of public focus that a whole generation had never heard of them. Yet the
moment I mentioned the name last year there was a whole gowk storm of
reaction, ranging from those who knew that Nancy Brysson Morrison was a
brilliant novelist to those who remembered the family from pre-war days,
sitting in the front of the gallery at Carmunnock Church.
One lady who knew their old home in High Burnside went to the trouble
of going along the street to take a snapshot for me!
I raised the name in the first place because Scottish playwright Colin
MacDonald, browsing in a bookshop, had come across The Gowk Storm, the
story of three sisters brought up in a Scottish manse, and found himself
quite entranced by what he read.
Ths book had actually brought Miss Morrison an international
reputation after she wrote it in 1933. Now MacDonald felt compelled to
turn it into a stage play but faced the problem of securing permission.
Was there any family left? Who was the executor?
Well, the readers of this column provided all the answers. Within
hours we had pieced the story together. A certain Dr Michie, a lecturer
at Aberdeen University, had befriended Nancy Brysson Morrison and become
her literary executor.
But the novelist died in 1986, at the age of 83, and Dr Michie died
soon afterwards. It was his widow, also Dr Michie, who took over the
responsibility and when I phoned her at home in Hull she was delighted
to give the copyright clearance.
So Colin MacDonald completed his play and, during my recent absence,
it ran for two weeks at the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh where, despite
mixed reviews, it ended up with a succession of full houses -- and a
profit.
The bandwagon was rolling. After that first article I had a call from
Dr Marjory Palmer McCulloch, a literary lady who had been asked to
contribute to a forthcoming book on Scottish women writers, dealing
particularly with fiction around that 1920s and 1930s period.
Dr McCulloch knew well of a Scottish renaissance at that time, with
men like Neil Gunn and Lewis Grassic Gibbon. But, much to her delight,
she discovered there were more distinguished women of that period than
she had imagined.
She was planning to write about women like Catherine Carswell, Dot
Allan, and Catherine Gavin. But by sheer chance, she too had just
discovered the name of Nancy Brysson Morrison. Captivated by The Gowk
Storm, she went on to other gems like her first novel, Breakers, and was
inclined to agree with Hugh Walpole's verdict that ''She writes like a
poet''.
Now with The Herald's revival of interest, she wanted to know more. Dr
McCulloch tells me that the book on Scotland's women writers is due from
Edinburgh University Press in the coming months. She also plans to give
more exposure to the Morrison texts.
I suspect the fates are behind many a so-called coincidence. That copy
of The Gowk Storm which Colin MacDonald spotted in the bookshop was a
reprint edition which was lying there in a state of modesty.
That was what, unwittingly, sparked off the renaissance of Nancy
Brysson Morrison. Now Canongate, the Edinburgh publishers who had the
wit to bring it out, tell me that The Gowk Storm, dating back more than
60 years, has not only been appearing on the list of Top Ten bestsellers
but is now at the point of another reprint because of the upsurge of
enthusiasm.
Nancy, a lady of that First World War generation who remained
unmarried, would be astonished and quietly delighted that her tale of
passion had found a new audience in the 1990s.
She and sister Mary lived in Hillhead and then Kilmacolm and were
familiar figures at Glasgow theatres in the early and middle parts of
the century. They were good friends of the Queen's physician on Deeside,
Sir George Middleton, and developed such a love of that idyllic corner
that Mary chose to be buried there.
Nancy passed away without notice in 1986, except for a simple death
announcement in the Times. No obituary. Nothing. In her time she had a
strong fascination with the spiritual boundaries of life and death.
However that was resolved, her ashes followed Mary to that simple grave
at Ballater, where they now rest together in peace.

WILLIAM BROWN, chairman of the Scottish Arts Council, may well believe
that the RSNO, SCO, and Scottish Opera ''came together voluntarily out
of a perceived need to seek joint solutions'' (May 26).
His major problem is that no-one else believes it, least of all those
who actually do the work, the musicians. Their perception of the
situation is based first of all on the explanations offered to them by
their own managements, but also on the fiasco of the late and unlamented
BBC SSO/OSO merger proposal. The current censorship issue will be seen
by them as rather unsurprising confirmation of a lack of credibility.
Mr Brown further asserts that the orchestra of Scottish Opera is
under-employed by about 50%. Regular patrons of Scottish Opera will have
noticed when they visit a performance that the orchestra is invariably
involved. The obvious conclusion must be that if the orchestra is 50%
under-employed, then the whole company is only working at 50% of
capacity. This is happening because opera is, by its nature, expensive
and the company is under-funded.
The question is: do we, as a nation, wish to have a national opera
company with its own artistic policy and its own artistic and technical
staff producing work of the highest standard? Or a team of full-time
administrators stitching together deals with all and sundry?
Perhaps the SAC would like Scottish Opera to advertise itself as
providing ''a cost-effective Cosi'' or ''a team-managed Tristan''?
Credibility will only return to the SAC when it joins wholeheartedly
in support of those who actually produce the artistic work -- the
musicians, actors, singers, etc -- instead of joining in the surrogate
creativity of producing unreadable Charters or issuing chilling threats
along the lines of Mr Brown's letter.
We certainly hope that the arts are to be exempt from the kind of
management style that uses ''change'' as a slogan, while screwing the
workforce for all it's worth and awarding fortunes to the
directors/shareholders. (If that sounds like a description of recent
years at Scottish TV, the coincidence is at least thought-provoking.)
Mr Brown promises us ''no ego trips, no hidden motives''.
Musicians think that would be a nice change.

THERE has been a great deal of heat generated regarding the Scottish
Arts Council's handling of the publication of a socio-economic study of
artists in Scotland (May 24 and 26). I wish to clarify some of the
issues which have arisen.
The SAC commissioned the Glasgow University departments of sociology
and social and economic research to undertake a research project
examining the earnings and working conditions of artists and how these
vary across the arts and at different points in artists' careers.
The study also traced the main influences and the main problems facing
artists which may cause them to reduce or cease their artistic activity.
The researchers were asked to establish what artists know about the
SAC's schemes of support, to indicate their use and views of such
schemes, and to elicit proposals for new types of support, and produce a
report. The researchers did an excellent job in establishing a
methodology for this work, carrying out the research and analysing the
data.
In the course of the discussions we had on the report itself the SAC
was unhappy about the presentation of the results in one area. This
disagreement, however, was one of emphasis only. Our concern was that
one section consisted of lengthy quotes from artists which were critical
of the SAC, other artists, and arts organisations and other
institutions.
While the views expressed were, and are, important, in our opinion
they were not central to the main issues contained in the brief, were
not related to the findings presented in other parts of the report, and
generally clouded the real issues.
These views were made known to the researchers. The findings have not
been ignored. They do appear in our final published report in summary
form along with illustrative quotes.
However, as a result of this divergence of views, it was agreed that
the SAC publish its own report, based on the research findings, and
crediting the work of the research team. I would wish to emphasise that
the SAC has at all times acknowledged the quality and value of the
research work.
The SAC has no wish to ignore artists' views. In November we published
a quite separate report about the negative and positive perceptions
artists and others have about the SAC. This report is the basis for a
programme of work currently being undertaken to improve the way we
handle, among other things, grant applications and information for
artists.
The really important finding of the socio-economic report is that most
Scottish artists live in poverty caused by low wages and long periods of
unemployment. This is the issue which all of us who have a
responsibility -- the SAC, other funding agencies, the trade unions and
artists' organisations -- should be tackling.

WHEN will Clare Henry's persistent bleating about Glasgow not winning
the UK Year of Visual Arts 1996 end? Her sniping at the Northern
Region's winning of the title is quite unnecessary and her reference to
Newcastle's Northern Region is inaccurate (May 23).
The Northern Region's bid was a joint initiative between Northern Arts
and all the local authorities; it was not a Newcastle bid as her article
suggests. The Northern Region won because its bid was the best and
suggestions of a political reason for Glasgow not winning the title are
not true.
1996 should be viewed as an opportunity for a flourishing of visual
arts on both sides on the Border and not as competition between Glasgow
and the North of England.
A little more charity and a lot more accuracy from Clare Henry would
be welcome.

In your editorial, Real danger to the Union (May 24), you appear to
have omitted to mention exactly why this Union is worth preserving.
Not once did you identify any of the myriad advantages which accrue to
Scotland from the present state of affairs. Instead you make the
dangerous assumption that Scots are already aware of these benefits.
I wonder, then, if in future you might devote some space to outlining
all of the favourable consequences of the Union, especially to the
unemployed, the unemployable, the homeless, the dispossessed, and those
living in poverty or at subsistence level in Scotland.
Once they realise what they may lose if the Union is broken, they may
rally round in defence of what you yourself have established as a cause
inherently worthy of protection.

A FERVENT football fan attempts to assess the monumental contemporary
bearing of a 2000-year old sport: ''Now with religion in decline, the
football ground is the focus of the community. In most working class
communities the stadium is the new cathedral because it is far and away
the most important building for miles around.''
The fan's devotion and dedication to the game is indeed worthy of
religious comparisons. The fan in question is Ged O'Brian, a man with a
bamboozling encyclopaedic footballing knowledge who also happens to be
the curator of the world's first National Museum of Football.
In 1998 -- ''God and Millennium Fund willing'' -- an estimated 400,000
fans will make the hajj to Hampden's south stand to visit what is set to
become a world centre of excellence for the display and research of
football. Housed in a 60,000 square foot area with enough inbuilt
flexibility for long and short term exhibitions, will stand a library
and archive, meeting and educational rooms, a lecture theatre, themed
restaurant and merchandising shop. According to Jim Farrey, chief
executive and secretary of the SFA, it will be a ''reflection of all
living and breathing things associated with football''.
However, before the gates to this Paradise swing open, the SFA Museum
Trust, composed of the SFA and Glasgow City Council, today launches a
pilot scheme at The Museum of Transport. A small scale exhibition called
''For The Sake Of The Game'' already ran there between May and December
1994, attracting 300,000 curious visitors. This latest revamped and
updated exhibition will hopefully exceed these figures. Among boxes of
unpacked SFA memorabilia, liberated from their Eglinton Terrace
boardrooms, O'Brian explains the importance of this ''halfway hotel''.
''Because it's the first of its kind,'' he says, ''it's important that
we assess the public's initial reaction, do market research and welcome
as much feedback from people as possible.''
The idea for a National Museum of Football was first mooted in 1947 in
the light of a successful exhibition held at Kelvin Hall to mark the
match between Great Britain and the Rest of Europe. Batted to and fro
between committees and sub-committees, it was not until the mid-80s,
when Ernie Walker then SFA secretary, recognised the social value of the
SFA's archives, that the wheels were set in motion to find a public
venue to house them.
The coincidental rebuilding of Hampden provided the perfect
opportunity to build a museum from scratch in what O'Brian refers to in
a blaze of superlatives, as ''the No. 1 footballing city in the world
and the world's most important ground''. To support these rather
extravagant claims O'Brian reels off a host of facts that obviously
astounded and convinced the powers and financiers that be. ''Scotland
boasts the second highest support per capita in Europe, bar Albania!'' .
. . ''At one point Glasgow had the three largest grounds in the world:
Hampden Stadium, Ibrox and Celtic Park.'' . . . ''Founded in 1873, the
SFA is the second oldest in the world only to England which was founded
by a Scotsman anyway.''
However it is the plucky Third Division team Queen's Park whose
illustrious history sealed the geographical fate of the museum. The
Spiders are not only the oldest Scottish club but actually founded the
SFA and invented the way teams play today. As a Queen's Park regular and
secretary of the club's Supporters Association for the last 21 years,
Keith McAllister is delighted at the choice of venue. ''It's a great
idea to base it in a city where football is instilled in the psyche,''
he says. ''I also think that Queen's Park's home ground fills that nice,
neutral buffer zone between Rangers and Celtic which should give us some
respect.''
According to O'Brian, respect not only for Queen's Park but all
football fans is well overdue. ''All the facts say that it's outrageous
that we don't have a museum already,'' he states. ''Our research has
shown that 80 per cent of the Scottish population want this and if I can
get only 10 per cent of them then we'll be stowed out.'' Another vital
aspect of the museum will be the social composition of an, as yet,
untapped market. ''Most football fans are in social categories C2DE and
are massively under-represented when it comes to museums. That's why
we're here at the Museum of Transport and not at Kelvingrove Museum
because the former attracts the same people we want.''
The absence of a football museum may also be due to the rather
transitory nature of the subject. Unlike object based museums like
Kelvingrove, this museum is context based, in that there are only so
many static objects indirectly associated with something that happens at
3pm on a Saturday and vanishes two hours later.
The advent of cheap and powerful technology has solved this problem as
O'Brian enthusiastically explains: ''We're going to have five
interactive computers at the Museum of Transport and 140 earmarked for
Hampden. So say you wanted to know about the 1962 Scottish Cup, then at
the press of a button you'll get photographic or moving footage of the
game on screen as well as all the team information, goals scored, etc.''
The computers are vital if the museum is to establish a comprehensive
library and archive that itself faces the mammoth task of nurturing a
link with other British and European universities engaged in football
studies. ''At the moment we're living on a myth,'' says O'Brian.
''Football may be ubiquitous but it's reported as a contemporary
phenomenon. Without an organisation dedicated to football history the
knowledge is lost. Ninety-nine per cent of football history is still out
there waiting to be saved.''
To this end he hopes to employ a team of researchers who will collect
audio and video interviews with former players, fans, managers and
officials, all of which will be incorporated into subsequent exhibitions
as a crucial record of 20th century football. Alongside, of course,
those more traditional ''exhibits'' from the SFA and Queen's Park
collections, donated memorabilia and items liberated from the vaults of
social history museums. One of the SFA's most valued exhibits is a
ticket, still intact, from the world's first international match between
England and Scotland in 1872. Or there's the 1907 Scotland strip still
pristine in Lord Rosebury's colours of baby pink and yellow.
At the end of the day it's not a museum of two halves but an
invaluable undertaking that Jim Farrey has no doubt will have only
positive reverberations for a football-mad nation. ''Not only will it
have a long term effect on tourism and education but it will give
prominence to the missionary work of Scotland as regards the world game.
Most importantly it will recognise the major part football plays in the
lives of Scottish men, women, girls and boys.''
* The exhibition opens at the Museum of Transport today.

IF Brian Wilson were to read The Herald as well as writing for it (May
12), he would know that when proposals to rationalise hospital provision
in London were published these were applauded by your correspondent,
John Warden, since they met the problem of over-provision in London
sucking in an excessive share of the National Health budget and
depriving the rest of England and Wales of resources.
The real act of betrayal was carried out, not by the 44 Tories who
supported the Tories, but by the 302 Opposition MPs who voted against
them.
So now we know the real stance of the Opposition parties. Let London
have the lion's share and leave only crumbs for the rest of the country.
So long as London is all right, the Midlands, the North, the West
Country, and Wales can go without.
Keep the monuments of the nineteenth century instead of looking to the
needs of the twenty-first century. Let us hear no more complaints about
too many resources going to London at the expense of the rest.
That is the policy of the Opposition parties, or were they merely
playing politics? Perish the thought.

YOUR opinion-poll results were extremely interesting (May 23). The
question on preferred options was the most interesting of all with the
majority in support of ''A Scottish parliament with substantial powers,
but within the framework of British government''.
No surprise there. It does sound very appealing but neither the Labour
Party nor the Liberal Democrats is proposing such a thing.
The Labour Party has said that its parliament would have no power over
employment, the health service, the economy, social security benefits,
or defence.
No substantial powers there. The only option that would have these
substantial powers would be the very dull description ''a completely
independent Scottish parliament separate from England''.
In future such questions should perhaps read:
Independence -- Full power by the Scottish electorate over Scottish
issues.
Devolution -- A nice safe middle-of-the-road talking-shop.
Status quo -- Pure bloody suicide.
The results may be different.

YOUR report of the visibly angry Environment Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, trying to wriggle out of all Scottish Office
responsibility for our stagnating railways is symptomatic of the obvious
unease felt by Ministers growing weary of their pretence that
fragmentation and investment starvation will somehow lead to a better
system (May 18).
Even his attempted disclaimer for the bumbling farce of the
privatisation experiment cannot hide the negative and perversely hostile
role played by his own Scottish Office towards the improvement of
ScotRail.
Valuable Section 56 capital improvement grants which the Scottish
Office could give ScotRail, and similar backing to apply for generous EU
funding, continue to be throttled by a behind-the-scenes veto of
anti-rail Scottish Office officials acting (presumably) under
instructions from Lord James himself.
Scottish Railtrack's opportunity to apply for up to 75% EU Objective
One cash grant, still on offer to achieve the vital Dornoch Rail Bridge
improvement on the beleaguered Inverness-Caithness line, is being
thwarted by Scottish Office mandarins, who doubtless fear the implied
permanence of rail operations north of Inverness which such fixed
investment would bring.
Yet on all the criteria of reducing regional peripherality,
significantly increasing all-year-round usage, improving efficiency, and
reducing the level of subsidy required, the Dornoch rail investment is
precisely what EU funding is intended for, were it not for the UK
Government's railway wreckers.
Only an announcement by our Transport/Environment Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, of early target dates for the required modernisation
and upgrading of ScotRail will change a firm electoral conviction that
Government deceit and evasion of responsibility are inexorably leading
to a shrunken and enfeebled railway network.

No self-respecting baker would use assorted vegetables or pre-cooked

THE best actors are said to spend long hours in front of mirrors, not
just in self-admiration, but practising facial expressions, gestures,
etc. Such accomplishments are of great value to television producers,
who use close-up shots to show the reaction of characters not speaking,
and explain situations that would take a writer several hundred words.
Rowan Atkinson is a master of this art, as was the late Tony Hancock,
over whose eloquent face could range over emotion after emotion. The
inadequacy of words alone becomes obvious to a young reader. Modern
authors probably no longer use the expression ''Tsk, tsk,'' but many a
child has searched the dictionary fruitlessly to find out what this
expression means. Much the same difficulty is enountered with characters
who raise their eyebrows, offer quizzical looks, or make ''moues'' of
disapproval. The child has no idea what is meant, although he would
understand it completely on television.
In these violent times, alas, the facial language of amateurs can be
misinterpreted. Men are advised never to make eye-contact with strangers
in lifts. Even a simple, well-intentioned gesture to another driver,
indicating that he is perhaps a gallon or two short of a tankful, may
cause him to jump out with a baseball bat. At the open-plan headquarters
of one British company, in order not to cause offence, employees who
want to concentrate, or are too busy for conversation, are being
encouraged to wear baseball caps as a ''Do not disturb'' signal.
This has normally has been a problem for managers, of course. There is
nothing more annoying, especially in the middle of a good detective
story, than to be disturbed by a knock on the door. In more biddable
times, the normal response would have been the ostentatious marking of
one's place, followed by ''Yes, what is it?'', and a deep frown. In the
new democracy of open-plan offices, even a simple scowl, like those once
used against talkers in public libraries, could be risky. These days it
is probably dangerous even for librarians to say ''Tsk, tsk.''

''MULTI-media performance'' can often be a byword for amateurish
hotchpotch, with companies attempting explorations of themes utilising
mediums they are only moderately accomplished in, diminishing their
strength in one area by exposing weaknesses in another.
However, Fecund Theatre grapple with multi-media in an impressively
multi-talented way. The six-strong cast's theatrical performances are
powerful whether in ensemble-playing or individually highlighted
segments, the dance sequences are tantalisingly choreographed, the
lighting and club music effects are slick and the video clips
impressive.
More important, it is cohesively staged; written and directed by John
Keates, who also performs, the 70-minute work is tightly focused around
an exploration of self-destructive sexual urges, occasionally breaking
off into tangential narratives, but always returning conclusively to the
central story of Lisa. She is tempted into sado-masochism by the
sinister but alluring Robert and then plunges headlong into a frustrated
despair eventually only finding satisfaction in an extreme solution.
It's a modern take on the erotic classic, The Story of O, studied with
post-modern reference points such as Lenny Bruce (played with awesome
verbosity by Domenic Coleman) drifting round and interjecting furious
monologues. The piece postulates that modern-day decadences are to be
found in the SM club dungeons, which might offer libertarian escapism
but can perhaps offer also too heady a buzz, as addictive and as
dangerous as the heroin stupor depicted on video.
A failing is the company's self-consciousness about their subject, a
genital-gazing over-eagerness to shock -- Keates snarling tiresomely
''do we disgust you?'' An intelligent work, it lacks the subtlety to
truly provoke.

ISRAELI settlers on the Golan Heights, an area of strategic importance
captured from Syria in 1967, are bitterly hostile to the notion that
their Government is contemplating returning the land involved as part of
a peace deal with the Syrian Government. Yet it is impossible to imagine
how a peace could be achieved between the two states without such a
transfer. Mr Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, has promised a national
referendum before anything is cut and dried but it is equally hard to
imagine the Israeli people as a whole passing up the chance of an agreed
peace and stable northern frontier for the sake of the 13,000 Golan
settlers. The settlers have worked agrarian miracles in the Golan and in
a rational world many might even consider staying put in the event of a
change of sovereignty. Such a day may eventually come in the Middle East
but it is not in sight yet: only in Israel itself are Arabs and Jews
assured of peaceful coexistence in one state -- and even there tensions
remain evident (as support for Hamas proclaims).
The Syrians are the most powerful of Israel's Arab enemies. They are
also the most obdurate and have shown little taste for a peace
settlement though everyone seems sure that they really do want one,
which is Mr Rabin's opinion. Negotiations began in 1991 and were
concluded with the Palestinians in 1993 and Jordan last year. The
Syrians are certainly in no hurry and they effectively speak for the
Lebanon as well. Right-wing Israelis believe that Mr Rabin has already
done a secret deal and agreed to withdraw from the Heights but the fact
that the Americans are still having to pressure the Syrians suggests
that any deal still lacks substance. Mr Rabin apparently wants to
withdraw in stages, but for the Syrians it has to be the whole territory
or nothing.
Apart from the anguish the 13,000 Golan settlers seem bound to suffer,
an Israeli-Syrian accord would deliver immense regional benefits. It
would effectively end the Arab refusal to allow Israel to exist and,
after a time, confer both stability and security on both sides. It might
allow Syria to attract Western, and other Arab, capital both to realise
its own economic potential and replenish the Lebanon's. The Syrians
still have to show that they will settle or remain embattled.

MOZART: A LIFE, Maynard Solomon, Hutchinson: #25
MAYNARD SOLOMON is one of the most wise and respected writers on
music. His classic biography of Beethoven was something of a landmark.
His new biography, Mozart: A Life, has already been published in the
States, and to wide and somewhat startling acclaim.
No wonder. In many respects this is an extraordinary book. The
rhetorical question that leaps to mind is: so you think you know your
Mozart? I'll be quite personal about my reaction, to try to explain.
Round about the halfway point in reading this weighty tome, while being
swept along by the narrative flow -- and for the most part the book is a
superb read -- I suddenly realised that I could almost see Mozart, hear
his voice, its accent and implication, follow his thinking.
Just a minute, I thought, how does Solomon know all this? The story
flows like romantic fiction. The classic European tours of the child
wonder, the developing bawdy sense of humour, the incredible facility
with which he composed and performed, his personal relationships -- from
the sexually uninhibited affair with his cousin, Maria, to the complex
relationship with his father, Leopold, of which much more in a moment --
all of this is known, has been written about. But never so graphically,
never so vividly, and never -- it seemed to me -- with such
psychological insight; you really do seem to be inside the characters'
heads, aware of motives and motivations.
Yet a check on Solomon's sources reveals he is drawing on basically
the same sources as Mozart's many other biographers. Sure, he has access
to recently discovered documents, such as minutes of Vienna city council
meetings, from which can be gleaned Mozart's earnings while in its
employ. But Solomon's fundamental sources are the same as everyone
else's: the seven-volume definitive edition of the letters and diaries
of Mozart and his family (published in the sixties and seventies) and
Emily Anderson's standard English translation of Mozart's own letters.
Quite simply, Solomon, with the doggedness of a detective and the
painstaking patience of an analytical scientist, has subjected these and
myriad other documents to an unprecedented scrutiny. But rather than lay
out the specimens on the lab bench for clinical survey -- which is the
tendency in musicology in these late-twentieth-century days of forensic
musical analysis -- he has used his evidence to flesh out Mozart, his
mind, his work, and his family.
It's daring, it's vivid, and it's quite astonishing in its effect.
What emerges is the richest, most humanising portrait ever of the
composer whose gifts appeared miraculous and beyond explanation, of the
most famous infant prodigy in history who was locked up in a room for
examination by the greatest contemporary brains in Italy and pronounced
''one of those freaks nature causes to be born''.
In truth, the book is unbalanced. It should be titled: The Mozarts:
Their Lives. In particular, it is an intimate portrait of Mozart and his
father Leopold. Here Solomon is definitive. From the moment Leopold --
whose own aspirations and ambitions are revealed as frustrated and
failed -- spotted the talent in his ''porcelain-child'' and identified
Wolfgang's ''rage for knowledge'', he consciously fashioned an industry
out of his son.
He induced in young Wolfgang Amadeus, from the earliest age, an acute
psychological dependency which generated an ambivalence and frustration
that extended into Mozart's adulthood and tortured him even beyond
Leopold's death. Solomon, in calling Leopold ''a hard man to like'', is
generous. Leopold was a brilliant entrepreneur and promoter, and a
consummate bastard in his behaviour to his son.
He haunts the book. He is endlessly manipulative of his son. He
projects himself as the ''begetter, instructor, and impressario'' of the
child genius. Hauling the five-year-old Mozart around the European
courts, Leopold protests penury and complains at the expense, while
banking a fortune that he revealed to no-one. (Solomon reveals just how
much Leopold was making on the back of his son.)
Leopold, who knew exactly that the dependency he was inducing in young
Mozart was in fact a dependency of his own, pursues his son into
adulthood, interfering in his personal, musical, and business affairs,
resorting to emotional and even financial blackmail to prevent his
source of income from cutting the strings. The resulting internal
conflict that racked Mozart spills on to the page. It's a fascinating
and pathetic tale, grippingly told.
On several occasions the book falters, wading into a treacle of
psychoanalytical gobbledook. In the main, it's a dazzling, revelatory
book, touched with some beautifully descriptive writing on the music
itself, writing that catches precisely the ambiguous quality of some of
the most exquisite music ever written, music that hovers almost
indefinably between pleasure and pain.

IT is a rare day I agree with Jack Tinker, the drama critic of the
Daily Mail, but that rare day has arrived. Writing about John
Gordon-Sinclair's performance in She Loves Me -- he won an Olivier award
for best performance by an actor in a musical -- Tinker wrote ''he
possesses the rarest of qualities -- 24 carat charm''.
So here I am being charmed by the lad in his dressing room, a powder
blue painted, windowless dungeon beside the stage -- the Savoy is one of
London's sunken theatres -- which he has turned into a home from home. I
suppose what did it was, as I negotiated the ever descending corridors,
tumbling down the preciptious stairs, was his shouting out fairly bawdy
directions. Then he gave me the one comfy seat and made coffee.
He made his name in Bill Forsyth's film, Gregory's Girl. It
established him as an actor and for many people was their main reference
point.
The film was made 15 years ago and he has since appeared in the West
End in plays like Simon Gray's The Common Pursuit, Ben Elton's Gasping,
and Sharman MacDonald's When I was a Girl I Used to Scream and Shout,
made a handful of films, including The Girl in the Picture and Britannia
Hospital, and appeared regularly on television where his work includes
the journalist sitcom, Nelson's Column. He is currently spending Sundays
shooting a new series.
How did he end up in a Broadway show? She Loves Me, by Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick, has been running here for a year. Based on a James
Stewart film, The Shop Around the Corner, it was first staged in New
York in 1963, then in London, and was revived on Broadway in 1993. The
show, romantic and tuneful, collected awards galore both times in New
York, and cleaned up in the 1994 Olivier awards, winning five, the most
ever given a musical. His co-star, Ruthie Henshall, with whom -- it is
that sort of show -- he fell in love, won the best actress Olivier.
Shortly before Christmas 1993 he thought he would like to learn to sing
and was recommended to go to the voice coach, Mary Hammond.
Shortly afterwards his agent rang asking if he would be interested in
doing a musical. He met the show's director, Scott Ellis, and the
musical director, Robert Scott, who comes from Ayr, and the meeting went
well. A week later he got round the piano with Scott, did some scales,
was told would need to learn to sing properly and he should go to this
great teacher -- Mary Hammond. ''If that wasn't coincidence, what is?''
he asked. ''They offered me the part -- I went to New York to see it --
I have to do it in an American accent as well, and started working with
a dialect coach. . . . I still cannot believe I am doing this. I find it
a bit strange really, but I wanted to do something far removed from what
people think John Gordon Sinclair does because was getting a bit bored
with the same old thing.''
He has only a few weeks left, the show finishes its run at the
beginning of July, and has other things waiting at the end of the
summer, he said. But first he wants a break. He and Ruthie have bought a
house outside Guildford. I said that reading past interviews I had got
the impression he lived in a flat alone with an exercise bike. ''I was
there for eight years, and for most of the time it was described as a
luxury pig sty,'' he said. ''But I did redecorate, put down carpet and
bought a sofa so it was eventually all right.''
They had chosen Surrey because Ruthie had friends there and he had
decided it was ''really beautiful, almost like being in Scotland''.
''I have wanted to get out of London for some time,'' he added. ''It
is not that anything has gone wrong with London, it is that some things
have never been right. I haven't had a garden since I came down here and
I am looking forward to that. It has its good points -- cinemas,
restaurants, theatres -- but it is not the best place in the world to
be.''
He would like to work with Ruthie again -- as well as being a fine
singer, she is a very good actress -- but it would depend on the right
show coming along. Their biggest problem, even although they were
appearing in the same show, was spending enough time together. ''It
sounds kind of strange to say that when you are working together, but
working is what you are doing,'' he said. ''We have very little leisure
time together. I am rehearsing Nelson's Column, recording it Sundays,
and have been for the last eight weeks so I am beginning to fray around
the edges.''
Two months into the run he damaged his knee when he fell badly after
doing a cartwheel during one of the numbers. It meant he was off for two
months, and that had been very frustrating because he had been enjoying
himself so much.
Scotland, he said, was home. Definitely. Even after all this time.
After just a weekend in Glasgow he felt recharged. It was the fresh air
and being surrunded by friendly people that did it. He said he still had
friends in Scotland he enjoyed seeing, and had few friends in the
theatre. ''It is not really my cup of tea,'' he said. ''I am not into
the luvvie darling side of things. I enjoy what I do. I get a lot of
satisfaction from acting, but I don't completely surround my life with
the theatre.''
So what does he surround himself with -- politics perhaps? Was he a
Luvvie for Labour? He said he had always voted Labour and he thought the
party had needed modernising. What Tony Blair was doing was along the
right lines. But he did miss John Smith, one of the few politicians who,
when they spoke, people believed were telling the truth.
As for the future, he is not thinking of giving the world his Hamlet,
which is what he realised actors did. It was a sort of benchmark in
their careers. He is not a reader of plays, and said he did not know
enough about Shakespeare, although he has played Orlando. But he does
want to do something different, having for some time been ''quite happy
poodling along''. He would like to do more films, and finds television
hard work because of the pressures on time and money and all the
compromises entailed.
Round about this point Ruthie came in with supper -- a roast beef
sandwich, coffee, and spinach wrapped in filo pastry, so it seemed time
to go. I asked, since he is so enthusiastic about Scotland, what she
thought and she said it presented no problems. They had a show to do
though, so it was time to go.

THE way they tell it, they're just a couple of free-wheeling,
imaginative entrepreneurs. And if they had won their judicial review on
Friday last, B J Cunningham and Sten Bertelsen could have stepped up
their lucrative trade importing cigarettes at cheap European prices and
selling them on to British smokers. Such is the disparity in tobacco
taxes that our likely lads could afford a decent mark-up before
off-loading supplies on the British market.
For the moment the law has stopped them in their tracks. For the
moment. But on previous form this duo will be back, shrewdly identifying
another loophole in the legislation which will allow their company,
Tobacco Direct, to continue their price war with the bigger boys in the
business.
You may remember their debut in this particular trade. They marketed a
cigarette called Death, which carried a skull and crossbones logo and
the information on the pack that smoking kills. In those days
Cunningham's message was that they were not just selling cigarettes,
they were taking the hypocrisy out of it. While other companies spent
fortunes avoiding court cases concerning tobacco-induced death and
illness, they would be right up-front about the fact that they were
flogging a life-threatening poison.
No hypocrisy. Just plain old-fashioned cynicism. And their European
adventure had the same hallmark of an eye for the opening.
They knew, because all the research confirms it, that the biggest
disincentive to smoking, especially among the young, is cost. Every time
the taxes are hiked in this country it encourages another raft of
smokers to quit, and stops another few thousand teenagers starting.
The Government may be mealy-mouthed about banning tobacco advertising,
but so far as its taxation policy is concerned it has helped price a lot
of smokers out of the market. The importance of continuing to bump up
the cost of a packet is underlined by the fact that the chances of
becoming dependent upon tobacco are greatly increased if you start the
habit before you're 20. Doubtless Messrs Cunningham and Bertelsen are
aware of that too.
The judicial review, of course, considered none of these factors. It
was merely concerned with assessing whether or not the law, which says
we can bring goods back from mainland Europe only in quantities deemed
suitable for personal consumption, had been flouted.
Thus far there's been no shortage of men driving van loads of booze
across the country who've somehow persuaded Customs and Excise that
they'll have no problem swallowing the contents over the course of the
following weekend with a little help from their mother-in-law. But
Tobacco Direct was the first company to go in for truly bulk imports on
the grounds that it was acting as agents for individual consumers.
So we will have to wait for a different kind of court activity before
not just the selling methods but the morality of dealing in tobacco in
any guise at any price is tackled. The power of the tobacco barons is
such that, remarkably, no case has been successfully pursued which can
be adopted as the kind of precedent health campaigners long for; a case
where compensation is granted for tobacco killing its customers.
And despite the might and experience of America's finest legal brains,
there is now a chance that precedent may actually be established here in
Scotland by the decision of the widow of Alfred McTear to pursue her
case against a major tobacco company.
It is hoped to force the company to appear in a Scottish court with
the specific documentation demanded. The actual case would hinge on the
crucial question of whether or not the company knew of the harmful and
addictive properties of its product but continued to market it without
disclosing the dangers.
The case raises the question of whether the major manufacturers were
aware that they were selling the only known legal drug which kills you
when you use it according to the manufacturers' instructions.
What is so extraordinary about the tobacco trade is that governments
world-wide are also now belatedly privy to the awful truth that we are
still permitting the sale of this most dangerous drug over the counter
as if it were bars of chocolate. If people are caught trading in
cannabis or especially in heroin they can expect to languish in the nick
with the key thrown well away. Yet known deaths from these illegal
substances are tiny compared with the wholesale carnage caused by
tobacco. Illegal drug use has ruined thousands of lives as we know. But
tobacco has killed millions.
It's probably unrealistic to make it illegal. It might well prove
counterproductive, as prohibition did with alcohol. But the very least
we can do is use every possible weapon to discourage its use. And if
Bertelsen and Cunningham go out of business, that would be another small
nail in the coffin of an industry with a pretty disgraceful track
record.

THE rugby-loving leader of Edinburgh's new unitary council is sorry he
hasn't the time or the money to go to South Africa for the World Cup,
but he will be glued to the televison.
As a youngster, Keith Geddes once played for a team called Gala
Wanderers -- taking part, he says with a smile, during its most
unsuccessful period. ''But I thoroughly enjoyed it. My father played for
Galashiels on occasion and I was named after a Keith Geddes who played
full back for Scotland at the end of the war. I think the family hoped I
would follow in his footsteps but it never happened.''
The game of rugby is woven deeply into the culture of the Borders
where he grew up.
''It helps to give the towns there a sense of identity and a profile
which places of that size perhaps would not have anywhere else. For
example, a town the size of Melrose has got a name that is
internationally known because of rugby.
''It has given a lot of the Borders young men a chance to travel far
and wide and be a great success.''
Geddes is the Queen's local councillor in Edinburgh, although he says
she hasn't approached him for any housing or planning advice as yet. The
job isn't by royal appointment -- which is just as well, as he is a
republican.
The royal connection comes about because Geddes represents the
Holyrood ward on Edinburgh's new single-tier city authority. It includes
the famous palace where Her Majesty resides when visiting the capital as
well as St Giles'.
Since 1990 this Borders-born 42-year-old has led the Labour
administration on Lothian Regional Council.
But royal constituents notwithstanding -- 1996 looks like being the
most important year so far in Geddes's political life. Not only will he
take over the reins of power in Edinburgh as Labour leader of the new
unitary council, but he is likely to be elected leader of the new
slimmed-down Convention of Scottish Local Authorities which he has been
helping to fashion as vice-president.
That political life got underway seriously when the youngster brought
up in Galashiels was a student at Edinburgh University and was enamoured
with what he saw as the radicalism of the Liberal Party!
''I took part in the 'Stop the Springboks Rugby Tour' protests. Our
local Liberal MP in the Borders, David Steel, was involved. I voted for
him at one General Election.'' But he adds with a grin: ''We all learn
from our past mistakes and I joined the Labour Party in 1976.''
Currently he is tackling the tough task of welding the new City of
Edinburgh Council's ruling Labour into a cohesive team. Stories
emanating from council corridors and coffee-rooms persistently suggest
that all is not sweetness and light between the ex-regional and
ex-district council members who make up the new 34-strong group which
will take power in the city in a year's time.
There was a distinct feeling in some quarters when the new shadow
council met for the first time that the big fish from the region had
simply gobbled up the smaller fry at the city chambers.
Not only is Geddes leader of the new administration, but regional
convener Eric Milligan will chair the council and almost certainly
become the next Lord Provost. Regional chief executive Tom Aitchison has
also won the job as the new council's chief official.
But Keith insists talk of region v district feuding has been
exaggerated. ''I think it will take a wee while for things to settle
down. But I have been pleasantly surprised that people have approached
things in a fresh manner and have not harked back to past allegiances.''
So what will be the priorities of the new Labour administration when
it takes full power for delivering council services in the capital next
April? First of all, during the transitional year, Geddes says they must
work to try to achieve a seamless transition so that the public do not
suffer a reduced level of service.
This will involve working in partnership with other councils in the
area to ensure that cross-boundary services such as concessionary fares
for the elderly can continue.
''After that our priority is to work towards making Edinburgh a truly
international capital city attracting investment from Europe, attracting
extra investment from the private and public sector to create jobs, and
to improve the quality of life in the city.''
The biggest and thorniest problem of all is likely to continue to be
Edinburgh's increasingly difficult traffic situation.
''There is no way we can solve these traffic problems without
investment from the private sector,'' says Geddes. ''Our first priority
there will be to create a dedicated link from the city centre to South
Gyle and the airport.''
The Labour administration, he adds, will also want to continue looking
at ways of reopening the south suburban railway line and creating
significant traffic-free areas in the city centre.
''We have no problem with bringing in the private sector as long as we
define the strategic priorities and take the political decisions.''
Geddes's own local government career began in 1982 when the former
housing rights' worker with Shelter (Scotland), who has a diploma in
youth and community work, was elected to the regional council.
He hasn't had an outside job for almost a decade now and says it helps
enormously that his wife Linda works full-time.
On his feet in the council chamber Geddes is a no-holds-barred
aggressive politician but offstage a pleasant informal manner puts him
socially at ease with opponents.
It is sometimes suggested by friend and foe alike that as a local
figure he has been a bit overshadowed thus far by his close regional
colleague, the high-profile, outspoken Eric Milligan.
The man with the moustache will certainly become much better known on
the national stage if he takes the Cosla presidency next year but
doesn't it irk him when it's suggested he's more of a stand-in than a
star?
Predictably he insists there is no rivalry. ''Eric is possibly the
most distinguished local government councillor in Scotland. He argues
the Labour Party's case better than most. I have just been delighted to
work with him for the past eight years in particular.
''The whole personal side of politics is something I am not greatly
concerned about.''
But he goes on to say they come from totally different backgrounds in
terms of Labour movement politics -- Milligan with a more Establishment,
trade union background and Keith coming in from ideological student
politics.
Politics in the US is one of his great interests and he makes an
unexpected reference to the Democratic Party Convention in Chicago in
1968 when police battled with students and political activists in the
streets.
''Maybe one difference between Eric and I is that while he would
probably have been inside the convention hall with Mayor Daley, I would
have been out in the streets with protesters like Tom Hayden.''

PERHAPS it was a glitch in the translation but I could have sworn that
Helmut Kohl addressed our troubled Prime Minister at last week's
British-German summit as ''Dear John''. Talk about Freudian slips . . .
After the events in Perth and Kinross confirmed that the Tories are in
freefall throughout the United Kingdom there was a cruel pertinence in
Dr Kohl's innocent term of affection for his personal friend but
political backslider in Europe.
The John and Helmut show is now a regular fixture with a predictable
script. Major goes to Bonn for regular summits and in alternate years
Kohl travels to London. This was the 25th annual assignation in which
the two former warring nations meet amicably and swear eternal
friendship and co-operation.
Hence the ''Dear John'' was the Chancellor's response to our Prime
Minister's memorable Majorism last time when he addressed Kohl as
''Chancellor Helmut''. There was another Majorism on this occasion. Dear
John said the alliance between Germany and Britain was silent. ''I would
like to see a partnership that everyone talks about'' he mused in a
passage which might have come straight from the Secret Diary of John
Major, aged 47[1/2]. The idea of ordinary Germans or Brits sitting in
earnest discussion of their new cordiality . . . well, sometimes
politicians get ahead of themselves.
This summit was different because the stage-management went all wrong.
We had been tipped off that the Prime Minister -- reputed to be one who
cannot pass a TV camera without stopping -- would be available for
comment on the doorstep of the British embassy just before he left to
meet Kohl.
The cameras were set up and the hacks gathered in the hope of a few
Prime Ministerial crumbs. But by that time Major had been told Roseanna
Cunningham was heading for the Commons from Perth -- and he wasn't
pleased. His Rolls swept him huffily past the microphones.
After the usual guard of honour routine he and Kohl sat down for one
of their chats. On the face of it they are indeed real friends. Helmut
confirmed he had just invited John and Norma to his home as his guests
on a private visit.
In fact they seem to have worryingly little in common inside the EU,
which is the central element of the British-German relationship (still
known in the Foreign Office and BBC as ''Anglo''-German, you will
notice). True, they agree on the need to expand the EU eastwards as fast
as possible to take in former Communist states, once someone has figured
out how to pay for them. Otherwise there is wide disagreement on the
immediate future.
Kohl wants a federal Europe, stronger European Parliament, more
majority voting, fewer (ideally zero) veto powers in a more open council
of ministers -- all areas Major has vowed to block.
The scope in Bonn for a wonderful stushie was endless. Which is
exactly why none of this was discussed. Instead the two men sat down to
agree such transfixing subjects as subsidiarity (devolution in decoded
Eurojargon) and all manner of recondite topics such as exchanges between
young people, etc.
THEY reckoned without the crazies among the Bosnian Serbs. As the
shells rained down on the ''safe'' areas and UN soldiers appeared on
television handcuffed to Nato targets (one of Saddam's bequests to
civilisation) most of the Bonn agenda went out of the window. Kohl and
Major suddenly got serious about working together.
It was an entertaining glimpse of how international diplomacy works,
or sometimes doesn't. For example, the greatest problem facing Kohl's
army of communications experts, summoned immediately to his office, was
finding Boris Yeltsin. The Russian leader was on the move -- just like
the French Prime Minister who was incommunicado in mid-air over France
-- and was eventually tracked down to Minsk.
It took some hours to set up a telephone line and interpreters. Making
sure the line was secure was, apparently, too much to ask in too short a
period.
We always hear about these conversations but we never know what is
said, except in terms which are self-serving to all concerned. Thus Kohl
passed the phone to Major who said he ''delivered a message'' to
Yeltsin, asking him to call off the Serbs. ''Now, Boris, sober up, and
pay attention. John here . . . John . . . John MAJOR, of course.''
Alas, we were told only a sanitised version of this flurry of
diplomacy -- not the whole truth. It must be fun listening in to the
blow-by-blow exchanges of world leaders, foreign secretaries, Nato
strategists, field commanders, UN officials, and diplomats. But not as
much fun as when they go wrong. The thought occurs that if it is so
difficult to fix up a line, why can't they all be issued with GSM mobile
phones?
Back at the Bonn press centre I was told by someone in the know how a
German Chancellor -- in a less sophisticated communications age - wanted
to speak to an American President who was in mid-air. The conversation
was ruined because he spent all his precious time asking questions and
getting no answers. All he received a few seconds later was his own
question bounced back as an echo.
But at least all this entertainment took Major's mind off Perth and
Kinross. As he left for London it fell to me to buttonhole him and ask
if he would now change his policy on Scotland.
He gave me his most charming -- I almost said winning -- smile and
remarked, predictably, that he never discussed domestic politics when he
was abroad.
I left Bonn with a funny feeling that the Tories are indeed
considering a U-turn on Scotland. Wooing the Scots could, conceivably,
still help the Conservative cause, although it is probably already too
late. Major could at least try before he receives his electoral Dear
John.

The scene is set for a fascinating couple of years, not least because
of the enhanced contribution of the SNP
ELECTION fever could hardly be said to be gripping Westminster, but
over the past week or two there has been a noticeable tweaking up of the
tension, which can only intensify in the weeks between now and the
summer recess. All sorts of little signs are there that the parties have
realised the General Election is looming almost exactly two years from
now, nothing like as long as it sounds.
The Question Time exchanges between the Prime Minister and Tony Blair
have become angrier, the Prime Minister is anxious that he and his
Cabinet are seen to have an active programme of legislation ahead, and
Mr Paddy Ashdown has begun to squirm.
Cabinet had a lengthy meeting last Thursday for a session in which
Ministers at least sketched the outlines of the legislation to be
announced in the Queen's Speech in November.
As well as legislation to implement the proposals on cross-media
ownership, it is understood that between 10 and 12 major Bills are
planned, including new laws to curb illegal immigration, the
privatisation of nuclear power, the expansion of choice in housing and,
possibly, moves to bring in a voucher scheme for nursery education.
The important thing about all this is that the Government must be seen
still to be full of ideas and not to have run out of steam. With
Government departments under constant pressure to come up with ways of
at least presenting policies in the most favourable light, it is not a
bad idea now and again to have some new policies to present.
Linked to the Queen's Speech and crucial to the Tories' fortunes, of
course, will be the forthcoming ministerial reshuffle, about which there
has been almost as much betting and speculation as there is about your
average horse race.
Jeremy Hanley is a gonner as party chairman -- they need someone with
a much surer touch and a higher profile -- and Virgina Bottomley cannot
possibly hang on as Health Secretary, but beyond that it is difficult to
work out what Major will do.
He is known not to like reshuffles and it is likely that the big three
-- Kenneth Clarke, Douglas Hurd, and Michael Howard -- will stay,
despite claims that Hurd may be getting a little jaded and Clarke's,
shall we say, somewhat gaffe-prone performance of late.
While we're about it, a fiver says Ian Lang will not become party
chairman. He has made the Scottish job his own, Michael Forsyth's
unpopularity with the voters would be a liability to the party north of
the Border and, as Chris Patten will tell you, it is jolly hard to
defend a marginal seat from several hundred miles away.
Over in the Labour camp, of course, all is sweetness and light, but
one gets the impression from time to time that it is rather too much so.
Blair undoubtedly is running a tight ship, but some elements of the left
in the parliamentary party are simply on board because they at long last
have a sniff of power.
Looked at from here, Labour is heading for a landslide and so the
left, however much trouble it causes, can easily be marginalised, but if
the election result is a close one it could still cause problems for the
leadership and demand some sort of price for its co-operation.
There is, also, a worrying sort of arrogance about some Labour people
these days, on both the front and back benches, which manifests itself
in any criticism of anyone, from Blair down, being laughed off or
scathingly dismissed.
Once the party seriously gets down to putting the meat on the bones of
its policies -- and it will have to do so soon -- that sort of treatment
will not do or Fleet Street's finest will go on the warpath. Ten minutes
in the company of Neil Kinnock will tell you what that can mean.
Which leaves us with the enigma of Ashdown and what on earth he thinks
he is up to. It appears that what he is trying to do is manoeuvre his
party away from its policy of equidistance between Labour and the Tories
to a more pro-Labour stance, while at the same time making clear that
there still are substantial policy differences between the two parties.
There would be no question of any formal pacts (Blair would have
nothing to do with such a concept anyway) but in the event of a hung
Parliament the Liberals would not be prepared to prop up a minority Tory
Government but would prop up a minority Labour one, simply because they
have a bit more in common.
Fine, but all the poor soul seems to have done is confuse the voters
and alienate senior and grassroots members of his own party.
One can understand Ashdown's desire to keep himself and his party as
players in the game, but when the likes of Liz Lynne, an Ashdown
loyalist and Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, start to complain about
the strategy, and party workers on the ground fear it might cost them
the forthcoming Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election, his judgment
must be questioned.
There have been occasional whispering campaigns about Ashdown's
leadership in the past and, while they have come to naught, my suspicion
is that while he will lead his party into the next General Election he
will not be leader for very long after it.
The scene is set for a fascinating couple of years, not least because
of the enhanced contribution the SNP will make after its triumph at
Perth and Kinross, and not least because a Government apparently in its
death throes is running out of time to find the tax cuts which might
give it more of a fighting chance. On your marks, get set . . .

SHE sails the high seas as a floating palace beyond compare, intended
symbol of the nation's prestige and a tradition ranging back through 300
years when Britannia could truly be said to have ruled the waves.
But now, as the royal yacht of that name, built at John Brown's of
Clydebank in 1953, prepares to leave her royal service within two years,
there is mounting speculation as to what her fate will be, and how she
will be replaced, now that the Queen has made it known there need no
longer be a yacht for the exclusive use of her family.
On both those counts, I understand, the river of Britannia's birth is
likely to come into the reckoning.
As bidders line up for a stake in her future, the ship's biographer,
Brian Hoey, tells me that one man's $100m ambition to turn her into a
floating casino has already been rejected. Another speculator sees her
as an expensive charter ship.
But the inside information is that the Queen and Queen Mother would
lend the most sympathetic ear of all to a bid from somewhere like
Clydebank, where Provost Jack McAllister is already gathering his forces
to bring ''the smartest ship in the world'' back to the town which built
her.
''The Queen's intention,'' says Brian Hoey, ''is that the yacht should
go to an area of high unemployment, to be used for the public good,
either as an educational establishment or as a floating museum.''
Though still recovering from a serious illness -- but with such
thoughts in mind -- Provost McAllister confirmed last night that he is
in touch with the business community and local enterprise body with a
view to drawing up a feasible proposition.
Before his collapse, he had already been to Long Beach, California,
home of that other Clydebank masterpiece, the Queen Mary, and gained
valuable intelligence about the financing of such projects.
As to a replacement ship -- a matter still to be decided by Parliament
and likely to include some private money -- any royal role would be
shared with that of a floating conference centre. But if the Queen has
her way, I'm told, that ship will be built in Britain.
Once again, there would be no more favourite choice than Clydeside,
despite the devastation of shipbuilding on what was once the world's
most prestigious river. So who could build it?
The Kvaerner yard at Govan and Yarrow's of Scotstoun have all the
capabilities -- and there is at least one other which will be pitching
if the opportunity arises.
Sir Ross Belch, who has had spectacular success in building up the
Ferguson yard at Port Glasgow, told me yesterday: ''Yes, we would be
very interested. This would likely be the size of vessel we could build,
in which case we would certainly be tendering for the order.''
The Britannia, which has now passed the million-mile mark, was first
mooted by King George VI in 1938 but was shelved with the coming of war.
Ironically, the order to build the ship was given to John Brown's yard
on February 5, 1952, the day before the King died.
So it has spanned precisely the reign of the Queen, launched in the
year of her Coronation and finding its way to her heart as the place
where she feels at her most relaxed.
Her Majesty flies out to join Britannia at foreign locations and
spends several hours a day working on papers with her secretary, Sir
Robert Fellowes, before the more formal occasions, like state banquets,
which are quite magnificent spectacles.
In his new book about Britannia, Brian Hoey, the former BBC Television
newscaster, recalls the ''Love Boat'' label which attached to the royal
yacht when it was used for one royal honeymoon after another.
''But it has really been a bit of a jinx for romance,'' he recalls, in
listing the honeymooners whose marriages have since come unstuck.
First came Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960,
enjoying their privacy in the Caribbean while, back home, Welsh
left-winger Emrys Hughes MP was questioning the cost.
In 1973 they were followed by Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips,
who ran into stormy weather in the West Indies and spent most of their
first week in bed -- separately!
Prince Charles and Princess Diana followed in 1981, flying to join
Britannia at Gibraltar en route to the Greek Islands, and the ill-fated
''Love Boat'' completed the royal honeymoons in 1986 with the Duke and
Duchess of York, who flew out to the Azores -- an area well known to the
Duke from his experience of the Falklands War.
The Britannia's crew, all volunteers of a loyal variety, are
nevertheless severely restricted in their use of cameras when the royals
are aboard. Brian Hoey tells me he has seen snapshots which, without
being sensational, would still have a high value in the tabloids.
While sailing as a guest in the Caribbean, Noel Coward played the
piano in the magnificent drawing-room and was joined by Princess
Margaret, who is no mean pianist herself, as are the Princess of Wales
and Princess Alexandra.
The Britannia contains furniture designed by Prince Albert and carried
over from the days of a predecessor, the Victoria and Albert.
Intriguingly, the present ship's wheel is also that of an earlier
Britannia, the famous racing yacht owned by King Edward VII and his son,
George V.
Before the latter died in 1936, he was so attached to the yacht that
he ordered her destruction.
After 42 years, today's Britannia is still running on her original
engines and is crewed by 21 officers and 256 yachtsmen (or Yotties, as
they are known). When royalty is not there, they are allowed to bring
families and friends on board -- as long as they are not journalists.
Since the royal yacht is totally unarmed, there is always an escorting
warship. The evening routine is that she is floodlit from 30 minutes
after sunset till 2am, while inside the atmosphere of receptions is that
of the drawing-room piano, with the Queen favouring composers like Cole
Porter, George Gershwin, and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
The band of the Royal Marines is always in attendance with royalty
but, when not required, is allowed to hire itself out commercially at
#3000 a time.
Commodore Anthony Morrow will be the last man to command Britannia, as
well as being the first to hold a position beneath the rank of
rear-Admiral. As he guides the ship into her final stage, the Queen
takes that public stance that she doesn't need a full-time yacht any
more.
But she will miss her favourite ship, and I'm pretty sure she would
like another one. But in today's climate, the certainty is that Her
Majesty is being no more than diplomatic -- politically correct -- to
fall in line with the Government view.
The royal yacht will therefore sail out of her life in 1997. Whether
it lands back in its cradle at Clydebank is the question which Scotland
awaits with interest.

THE RETREAT of the British state from many of its responsibilities has
been an alarming process, and in many cases a shameful one. The nanny
state has gone, but only to be replaced by the negative state. This is
where care of members of the community by the state is a derided notion.
One of the biggest disgraces has been the abandonment by the National
Health Service of free care of the elderly without decent notice and
without any appreciable public debate. The elderly resent this. They
insist that they have paid taxes all their lives and believed that care
from the cradle to the grave was the only proper response by the state.
Instead they have been abused in ageist terms and threatened with the
responsibility for crippling the younger members of society in the
future. The state says that the elderly must pay for their own care and
this, increasingly, means paying heftily to private residential and
nursing homes.
It is true that there is a shortage of money for care. There always
will be and it will probably get worse. To this extent the Government
has been following a remorseless logic in abandoning free care for the
elderly. This is not the root of the present complaint; it is the lack
of honesty by politicians of all parties. Until very recently assurances
of care were given, then abruptly dropped, without giving people the
chance to examine the problem, canvass for alternatives, and at least
discuss their rocky future. Politically, this issue is becoming
dangerous for the Government, with complaints from natural Conservative
supporters mounting at an alarming rate. This could result in some sort
of vote-saving fudge in the short term, but it will not address the
problem for the future.
In that respect the Co-Operative movement at least has had the guts to
admit that no Government could provide total funding, but that other
ways may be possible. The provision by the Co-Op of #10 million to
establish non-profit-making residential homes and day-care centres for
the elderly is intriguing. It is clear that the movement has been
worried by the privatisation of care, and is willing to accept the
inability of the state to pay for everything for everyone, but unwilling
to adopt the Government approach, which is simply to fling the problem
on to the sufferers. This is serious, honest politics, and we need more
of it.

Can the Government now succeed with its NHS pay policy following the
collapse of the united front of trade unions? Christine Hancock, general
secretary of the Royal College of Nursing insists there remains a common
purpose. Chris Holme reports.
GROWN men were crying at Harrogate. Even hard-boiled sparkies doing
the electrics at the RCN congress were left sobbing. The RCN had crossed
the Rubicon to the land of militancy, swept over on a torrent of emotion
-- or so it appeared.
One week later and the collective union approach, which had long
seemed shaky, collapsed as Unison attacked the RCN for not joining in
talks with the Government.
In her office overlooking London's Cavendish Square, Christine Hancock
paints a calmer picture. ''Maintaining a united front is always
difficult because the various parties have some common areas and some
differences.
''The majority of Unison's members are not on pay review body terms.
By allying all its members to the nurses's cause, it is seeking to make
its case more winnable.''
However, Ms Hancock insists, each body's pursuit of its own tactical
objectives should not detract from their shared opposition to the
Government policy, particularly when articulated by Health Minister
Gerald Malone.
RCN ballot papers will start going out this week asking nurses to
replace Rule 12. It is far from being a headlong dive to the barricades.
The ballot actually gives the first explicit statement that nurses will
not act in a way which is detrimental to the wellbeing of patients. This
was implied in the old constitution but not formally stated. The motion
empowers the RCN council to authorise industrial action, but only
subject to that underlying principle.
Ms Hancock said the move was much more a part of the RCN moving away
from the compliant, angelic stereotype to something more akin to the
skilled professional workers they now are.
''Nurses have a distressing and demanding job, but they do not go
round shouting about it from the rooftops. What nurses are saying is
that we will not be walked over. Having the power as a negotiating
weapon is not the same as using it,'' she said.
The ballot requires a 66% vote in favour to make the change. Ms
Hancock is confident it will be achieved. Any industrial action would
require a second ballot and is likely to be targeted by the RCN
sanctions committee against the 160 UK trusts which so far have not made
any offer.
Ms Hancock dismisses ministerial claims that anything would inevitably
affect patients, pointing out the harm Government ineptitude in handling
the pay dispute has already done to nursing morale, industrial relations
and the health service throughout the country.
''My guess is that if we take any industrial action, it is much more
likely to be about standards or service cuts rather than pay,'' she
said. ''It is quite incredible that four months after the review body's
announcement that so many trusts still have not made offers at all. At
the same time, we have the nonsensical examples of two trusts based in
the same hospital with adjacent wards giving different pay to nurses.
''Nurses do not expect to be highly paid, but they do expect to be
fairly paid, and that is more comfortably done in a national
structure.''
Stalemate has been established with the RCN waiting for 300 acceptable
offers to achieve a national settlement by pressure of critical mass.
The RCN believes it cannot lose in a protracted dispute if public
sympathy rises as the Government's popularity continues to wane.
Conversely, Ministers may be able to exploit the RCN's apparent
isolation by using the tactic of divide and rule. They are also
confident that public sympathy will turn to hostility as the prospect of
industial action looms.
Current legislation renders it virtually impossible for unions to call
a national strike and all are reluctant to ballot for specific action
while talks offer the prospect of settlement.
Everything points to a compromise, but the bitterness already caused
by the dispute may have longer-term implications for the NHS. Ms Hancock
says market forces, which were the mainspring behind the Conservative
NHS reforms, may yet swing against the Government.
''You cannot run the health service without enthusiastic and
well-motivated nurses. The Government ought to be worried about the
levels of discontent and demoralisation,'' she said.
''There are nursing shortages across the United Kingdom, and if the
economy picks up, poorly paid nurses might look elsewhere. Nurses are
conscientious, good in a crisis, efficient and largely computer literate
-- and very employable in other areas.''

American Paul Strand, a nomad with a passion for photography, has left
a body of masterworks which not only explore a vanishing Europe but
immortalise the landscapes and the people, as Clare Henry discovers
PAUL STRAND began his new European life at the age of 60. He left
America for France, bought a house in a village not far from Paris, and
married his third wife, Hazel. In front of him were 26 years of
exciting, intense, strenuous work. A nomad at heart, he travelled
constantly: to Romania, Italy, Egypt, Ghana and the Outer Hebrides in
search of the perfect village, immortalising a fast-disappearing way of
life with his lens, uniting a portrait of the land with its people.
At the end of his life he wrote: ''The artist's world is limitless. It
can be found everywhere; far from where he lives or a few feet away.
Finally, it can be seen that what I have explored all my life is the
world on my doorstep.''
In America, Strand had made his name as a photographer and film
cameraman with exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art; movies in
Mexico. By the First World War he was a seminal figure. In Europe's
1950s he was unknown.
''He dropped out of sight for 20 years,'' says Catherine Duncan, who
met Strand in Paris in 1950, and remained a close friend till his death
in 1976. ''He was deeply disillusioned with the McCarthy era and it was
easier to work in Europe than America. It was 1971 before he retook New
York by storm.''
His exhibition, The World on my Doorstep 1950-76, at Edinburgh's
Scottish National Portrait Gallery until July 9, is impressive. It's the
only British venue for this important event, featuring 150 images from
his European period, some never seen before. Strand was a purist. These
stunning masterworks of photography are both heroic and timeless. Uist's
horses on the beach, a dow on the Nile at Aswan, a donkey in El Hawaslia
and the Romanian dirt track -- all have been there since time
immemorial.
For a city boy, born and raised in New York, moving to rural Europe
must have been something of a culture shock. One can argue as to how far
he saw it through rose-tinted specs. Certainly he was no American
tourist. He never took pictures of Notre Dame, Venice or any so-called
''picturesque'' views of the Loire, but even so, lush panoramas like
Haying Haut Rhin 1950, Tuscan House, Cut Grass Luzzara or Harvest South
Uist 1954, have that quality of an idyll as seen through outsider's
eyes, while his fascination for vernacular doorways and windows with
their cats, flower pots and shutters, verges on the sentimental. Did
those upmarket holiday postcards really start here?
Certainly, he gloried in his own garden at Orgeval. ''Its columbine
days and the sunshine of marigolds. Happy families of buttercups and
bachelor's buttons,'' as he described the garden when he first arrived.
In retrospect, Strand preferred the later, more austere, prints when
winter laid bare the structure of the willow and the dark whorls of its
bole: close-ups with a sense of the beyond. ''Latterly, he wouldn't even
allow leaves to be swept up,'' said Duncan. Sadly their collaboration on
a garden book, with text by Duncan, was never published.
But in the ordinary peasant people he found his salvation. ''I arrived
finally at the smaller, the less known, but I think not less expressive
aspects of life -- in the landscapes, the detail of a window, above all,
in the people themselves.'' These more challenging images have a sense
of place; an intimate knowledge which is, above all, about universal
truths.
Thus Strand's work for this period divides easily into two -- distant
views of sweeping land and sky or memorable confrontational close-ups.
The portraits are his strongest work. He attacks his sitters with
head-on resolve; an intense meeting of eyes -- and they give as good as
they get. No frills, no facade, no Sunday best (though Archie MacDonald
has polished his boot), no smiley posing here. Take it or leave it; I am
as I am, they seem to say.
''Strand had a Medusa glare,'' remembers Duncan. ''He looked right
through you. He seemed to know what kind of person you were.'' He wasn't
interested in famous people; he never took his friends, preferring
anonymous folk with no pretensions; those who had survived with human
dignity despite everything life had thrown at them. His series on
prominent French intellectuals from 1956/8 was not a success; he was no
good with sophisticates.
''Look at his picture of Cocteau. Under Strand's gaze his mask is
slipping. He looks uncomfortable, even foolish,'' notes Duncan.
Strand, single-minded and determined, lived and slept photography.
''Nothing else mattered. He had no outside interests; no children. His
photographs were his children.'' He was taciturn and stingy with money,
aware that only his inheritance from the family enamelware business
allowed him to follow his career.
''He paid to have his books printed. He never made any money,'' says
Duncan. He worked endlessly: planning, photographing, printing, keeping
a life time of negatives and prints locked in storage or under the bed.
''But he was always the star. He liked to be the centre of attention. If
he wasn't, he went off and sulked!''
His images were planned with books in mind, to be perused on your
knee. Strand spent days trying out different sequences and
juxtapositions until they combined to make a third dimension, like the
rhythm of a film. So I find the SNPG layout inevitably problematic: 150
black-and-white rectangles on the wall is far from ideal. Details like
the tactile gestures at Luzzara's Market Day or the darned jumpers of
Uist are missing. For once the accompanying catalogue is well worth
while.
His work is known for its immaculate velvet tonality. ''His vision is
flawless, the technique impeccable, the command of the medium total,''
said Hilton Kramer. Yet, according to Duncan, he wasn't interested in
technique per se. ''His darkroom was primitive. He didn't even have a
timer for developing his prints!''
Scotland holds a prime place in the history of photography, so it's
entirely appropriate that this show is exclusive to Scotland. Moreover,
in the past 11 years the SNPG has built up a tremendous collection of
22,000 photographs, largely due to generous public gifts and bequests.
Strand was a great admirer of Scottish pioneers Hill Adamson and put
them among his top three photographers.
Sadly, the SNPG doesn't possess a single Strand print, not even of the
Hebrides. They can be bought, I'm reliably informed, for about #3500.
Until this year, the SNPG had an annual budget of #10,000 for
photography. Now it has nothing. Think how many Hebridean Strands could
be bought for the price of a Three Graces fingernail.

Gaining work after serving a prison sentence can seem an impossible
task. Apex Scotland, however, has recognised the work skills of
offenders and the importance of regular employment to increase their
chances of rehabilitation. Anne Johnstone reports
* Joanne is 21. She will soon complete two years' probation for a
grievous bodily harm conviction. Apex arranged training in hairdressing
for Joanne and organised child-minding for her son. She is now training
towards Level 2 City and Guilds Hairdressing and is on regular placement
at a salon.
Rab is 35. He was convicted of murder in 1978 and released in August,
1991, on life licence. Apex helped Rab get into college on a full-time
carpentry and joinery course. Since completing the course he has had a
number of temporary jobs. He is now learning to drive with an
Apex-secured grant.
COULD James be the least employable man in Scotland? At 34, he has
never had a steady job. He has no qualifications. He has spent most of
the past 12 years in prison serving time for some of his 60 convictions,
mostly for poaching and housebreaking. But James is being helped towards
a new future by Apex Scotland, an enterprising small charity which helps
ex-offenders move from the prison gate to the world of work. It
advertises its service with the simple epigram ''Starting work, stopping
crime'' and it is inspired by one simple and compelling statistic: an
ex-prisoner is three times less likely to re-offend if he is in
employment.
''We're dealing with people who, on the face of it, have the least
chance of getting work. It can seem like an impossible task,'' Jeane
Freeman, director of Apex Scotland, said. And yet, according to their
annual report published this week, of the 4000 men and women who used
their services last year, 40% found work, 28% went on to further
education or training, 25% continued to use Apex facilities and just 5%
re-offended. The fate of the remaining 2% isn't known. In spite of the
unpromising nature of the material, these figures compare with the most
successful training schemes on offer to the unemployed.
James was referred to the Apex employment unit in Stirling last
January. They began by putting him on a Community Action programme in
gardening to get him used to the idea of work. He is now about to start
a two-year college course in motor mechanics. And he has won a #250
grant towards driving lessons.
When he came out of prison, James was convinced that his lengthy
criminal record would hang over him for the rest of his life, and he
would never get a job. However, staff at Apex were able to show him,
under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, how 58 of his convictions had
already been wiped off the slate and how the other two would be spent by
1997 -- provided he didn't get into more trouble. Having discovered the
possibility of a future outside the world of crime, James has become a
model trainee, working his socks off and never missing a day, according
to Apex staff.
The successful rehabilitation of James and hundreds of others like him
is all the more remarkable in a political climate in which the interests
of offenders are being downgraded in favour of more sympathy for the
victims of their crimes. The fact that Apex Scotland is significantly
more successful than its English counterpart is partly a reflection of
the contrast in attitudes between the Home Office and the Scottish
Office. As one well-placed insider put it: ''The Michael Howard view of
crime and justice isn't shared here. Scotland isn't going all out for
secure units and boot camps. There's a recognition that this approach
doesn't work.''
Jeane Freeman said: ''The distinction between work for offenders and
work for victims is a false one. We've had a great deal of support from
the Scottish Office because they recognise that we're moving people out
of the world of offending. The success of Apex is in the interests of
victims. It's a form of crime prevention.''
About 70% of those convicted were unemployed at the time the crime was
committed, and 85% of prisoners were unemployed immediately before they
were jailed. That compares with an unemployment rate in Scotland of
8.2%. ''Most of the people we're working with have been unemployed for a
long time. Some have never had a job. A lot of those committing crime
don't conceive of a realistic alternative. They see themselves as locked
out of society, largely because they don't have a job,'' Freeman said.
This particularly applies to the 15 to 18 age group, the largest growth
area in Apex's work.
Apex offers each client a package tailored to their needs. About a
third have literacy and or numeracy problems, and this is tackled
through a course using job advertisements and application forms.
Employment units dotted around the country offer basic skills and work
experience. A group of young men at the unit in Blantyre yesterday were
turning out bird tables and elegant pine wardrobe doors. ''B and Q sell
these for #129 each but ours are cheaper and just as good,'' boasted a
boy in a baseball cap. The lads are scored not just for their learning
skills but a whole raft of competences ranging from time-keeping to
self-confidence. And though Apex isn't in the business of securing jobs
for its clients, the charity tries to offer them placements in local
companies.
Apex is sensitive to the perception that it is ''rewarding people for
being bad''. ''No, we aren't,'' Jeane Freeman said. ''We're simply
giving them the opportunity to stop being bad.'' The courses and grants
Apex puts into packages for its clients are similar, or the same, as
those available to all the unemployed. ''We're just accessing what's
already there.''
But how do you sell the virtues of employing an ex-convict to an
employer, especially in areas of high unemployment? Freeman has found
that there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. The wrong way is to
ask a businessman if he would consider employing an ex-offender. ''The
answer is almost invariably no.'' Instead she talks to them about the
people and their skills, emphasising what they would lose by not
employing them.
Jim McManus, Scottish Office ombudsman for prison complaints, said a
large part of Apex Scotland's success is that Freeman, once a researcher
in Saatchi's charities unit, can get alongside Scottish businessmen and
talk to them in a language they understand. For example, Apex offers the
business community a service known as ''risk reduction recruitment''.
The potential employer is invited to look at the nature of the
individual's offences and decide whether they are relevant to the job.
''We wouldn't expect someone with theft convictions to land a job as a
cashier but they might be perfectly suitable for a driving job,''
Freeman said.
She added: ''We don't want to be seen as a bunch of amateurs with
hearts of gold.'' They aren't, judging by the impressive list of
sponsors listed in the report, including IBM, Kwik Fit and the
Clydesdale Bank. Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, is on the board.
The secret of their success is simple. They treat their clients like
responsible adults and give them opportunities to achieve. Perhaps there
are wider lessons here for a society in need of radical strategies to
engage the interests of a generation of alienated, aggressive,
unemployed young people.

THE Scot known as Captain Catastrophe because he was rescued at sea
eight times in as many weeks arrived home yesterday -- his craft perched
on the back of a lorry.
Relieved but unrepentant despite criticism from the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution who said the rescues probably cost about #10,000,
Mr Robert Turnbull, 51, said at Broughty Ferry harbour: ''I don't
consider I wasted public money. I only asked to be rescued twice, and
frankly, got the impression I was being treated as an RNLI exercise.''
The maiden voyage from Hastings, Kent, of his boat, Curlew, ended at
Bridlington, Yorkshire.
Appropriately, he arrived home on National Lifeboat Day, with the
Broughty Ferry boat crew celebrating with the public.
The last stage of the voyage by road was thanks to a Broughty Ferry
haulage company owner, Mr Eric Tait.
He explained: ''I read all about Robert and, as I was delivering a
caravan to Doncaster, I offered to make a detour to lift him out of his
problem.''
Mr Turnbull, an out-of-work jeweller from Dundee, said he hoped to
apply for membership to Royal Tay Yacht Club, and would be more careful
in future.
He had sailed alone, without a radio, but did carry flares which he
used twice -- on one occasion, when he said he was severely ill from
seasickness.
Commenting on the number of rescues, he said: ''There were times I
wished I was invisible because I was in no danger.
''Getting the offer of a lift back with Eric was one I could not
refuse. He is a hero as far as I am concerned.''
Mr Turbull added that after a few repairs to his boat he hoped to be
sailing in the near future, ''probably in the River Tay''.

Rail services are under threat as unions and management head for
confrontation, reports Elizabeth Buie
THE prospect of a summer of discontent across the rail network can
bode nothing but ill for Scottish services, especially in rural areas.
Campaigners for Highland rail services are becoming increasingly
concerned that the rail unions are being pushed into a strike by the
management of British Rail so that managers can win public support by
shifting the blame for rail problems, and in so doing find the leverage
they want to cut jobs and services.
If they are right, it is a high-risk strategy. The signalworkers'
strike last year cost BR between #150m and #200m (#10m in Scotland) in
lost revenue, sent some freight back on to the roads, and lost a sizable
proportion of customers.
The indications are, however, that everyone involved in this
increasingly tense battle is becoming more entrenched and that each side
has its own conspiracy theory about what everyone else is trying to
achieve.
From the rail unions' side -- the train-drivers' union Aslef and the
main Rail Maritime and Transport Union -- this year represents their
last chance to negotiate on a nationwide joint basis. Future
negotiations will be held at local level with individual companies.
The unions asked for 6%, and received a final offer of 3% -- a figure
below the Retail Price Index rate of 3.3% when after last year's
signalworkers' damaging strike, the unions warned the Government they
would accept nothing less than the inflation rate in this year's
settlement.
BR may well see the unions' defiance as politically motivated -- an
attempt to derail privatisation. The unions believe that management
intransigence over pay and myriad other conditions, including rotas and
dress codes, are calculated to provoke their members.
Train drivers will be balloted on a series of one-day strikes to back
up their claim. Aslef's Scottish district secretary, Pat O'Connor, is
adamant: ''We will return a 'yes' vote for industrial action -- no doubt
about it -- to get management to back off.''
He is also convinced that the management of ScotRail is determined to
cut services where it can. Following meetings last week with ScotRail he
believes that even if ScotRail loses its appeal on Thursday against Lord
Kirkwood's decision that it must hold proper public consultation over
the Fort William sleeper service, ScotRail will still close the service.
''They will go through the consultation procedure and then withdraw
the sleeper service. They have not budgeted for the sleeper service and
now if they are being forced to go through the consultation procedure --
which I believe they could do in six months -- they will have to find
the money to run the sleeper service for that period,'' said Mr
O'Connor.
He predicted that if forced to find other areas where cuts could be
made, ScotRail might target services between Glasgow and Edinburgh after
7pm, making them hourly rather than the current half-hourly service.
Mr O'Connor's theory is that the management is either trying to
antagonise the unions into some form of dispute to try to frighten
franchise bidders off and give the management buyout a better chance,
or, because it realises that privatisation will not work, it is looking
for an escape route.
The message from the Highlands, however, is: ''Hold back a bit, lads,
you could be jeopardising our position.''
Councillor Iain Macdonald, vice-convener of the economic development
committee of Highland Regional Council, and an active campaigner for
retention of the sleeper service, said: ''Either deliberately or through
ignorance, the unions are being pushed into this position which suits BR
down to the ground. There is nothing they would like better than
industrial action which would put us in a very unenviable position.''
Councillor Macdonald warned the union leaders to ''look very closely
at their position'' lest the sleeper campaign loses ground.
He feared that industrial action would allow BR to argue that it was
doing its level best to ensure the public got a viable service and that
the unions had sabotaged them for political reasons.
''They will have the opportunity to go in there, sack the lot and take
back only those that they want, and work out a whole new system of
rotas, and point out that they have to cut services to ensure that the
rail system remains viable,'' said Councillor Macdonald.
The indications from potential franchise holders are that a strike
would indeed discourage them from bidding. Such a prospect, coming in
the wake of the Transport Secretary's announcement on fare-capping,
would seem to make the railways a less attractive cherry to pluck.
But the implications for workers are also serious -- loss of business
revenue which, judging by the effects of last year's signalworkers'
strike would be inevitable, would in turn leave rail managers with very
few areas to trim costs. The most obvious potential area would be
staffing. Rail sources claim that they are committed under the public
service requirement to maintain services, but few would doubt that lower
staffing levels would affect the frequency and standard of services. A
full-scale dispute might also permit the franchise director to write a
new set of rules.
ScotRail is currently counting the cost of the Fort William sleeper
battle -- #2.5m in the long term and a further #1m on costs if the
sleeper is kept on the summer timetable. It has already warned that
services will be slashed unless the Government drops its demands for
budget cuts. Industrial action would be the nail in the coffin, given
the fact that it is obliged to run within budget. At present it has
committed itself to running half-hourly services between Glasgow and
Edinburgh after 7pm -- but a strike might alter that.
Labour's transport spokesman, Henry McLeish, said the threat of
industrial action was something that would have to be settled between
the unions and the British Railways Board. He said the franchising
process was in a state of disarray and unlikely to meet Government
targets. However, Labour's concern, he said, was that according to
figures leaked from the franchise director's office, each passenger
journey receives a subsidy of #4.
''The big worry is that the franchise director starts to look at that
as a norm and that he wants to cut back on rural routes,'' said Mr
McLeish.
The crucial issue was to persuade the franchise director to distribute
his #2.1bn subsidy pot fairly for rural services, he said.
''If a dispute takes place, the train operators will be at the sharp
end, ScotRail's position will be precarious, and politically, because
the Government is in such a mess, it will try to portray the railwaymen
as creating further operating difficulties for the routes. But it has
everything to do with privatisation and the shift in subsidies,'' he
said.

IT'S the revolt of the little people, which the big bosses believe
they can buy off for #2. Life though, as the directors of British Gas
will discover on Wednesday, is never that simple.
Time was when a company's annual meeting was a chance for old friends
to join for a cup of coffee and some canapes. If there were any awkward
questions they would only be from some dusty old spinster in the corner
who wanted to know why the company had changed so much since her
great-uncle, who had left her the shares, had been in charge. Nothing
that couldn't be swept aside with a few patronising remarks.
Then in the eighties came the professional dissenters; shop stewards
and politicians who took the Thatcher share-owning democracy to heart,
and purchased token shares so that they could berate the bosses for the
latest round of closures and job losses. They made a lot of noise, but a
few choice remarks from the stage about how sad the losses were,
nevertheless the greater good of the company was at stake, usually dealt
with that lot.
Now on Wednesday comes the biggest mass dissent so far, with more than
5000 British Gas shareholders expected at the London Arena in Docklands
for the company's annual meeting. Most are overwhelmingly against the
crass way chief executive Cedric Brown lapped up a 70% pay rise of
almost #500,000, plus numerous share options, while at the same time
sacking workers and closing showrooms.
Chairman Richard Giordano is so uncomfortable at the revolt that he
has been racing around the major institutional shareholders in past
weeks making sure he can count on their support. The support will come,
but perhaps at a price. The pension funds and assurance companies, who
own the majority of shares, do not like to see their clients' money
invested in companies which constantly attract a bad press.
Brown and Giordano will mathematically win the day on Wednesday, but
if the dissenting shareholders continue to organise and then target the
pension and life assurance companies themselves, then the institutional
shareholders will demand that future pay excesses at British Gas are
trimmed. It is even claimed that they will quietly ask for either Brown
and Giordano to slip away from the company in the not-too-distant
future.
To deflect criticism, it's believed British Gas will announce on
Wednesday a new prompt-payment discount, which allows people who pay
their bills within 10 days to be given a #2 discount.
If they had calculated that this would take the heat off themselves,
they have once again badly mishandled the public relations. Rarely has
such a strength of ill-feeling towards directors from small shareholders
been on show before.
Buses have even been organised by the Scottish National Party and the
public service union Unison to take small shareholders and disgruntled
staff down to lobby the London meeting. ''There will be a piper to see
them off. It will be like a modern Jacobean army,'' SNP leader Alex
Salmond remarked. ''Only we expect them to get further than Derby this
time.''
The directors face two hostile resolutions on Wednesday. The first
comes from retired St Andrews University professor Joseph Lamb, who
wants a consultative committee of staff, small shareholders and
consumers which would meet the chief executive and chairman three or
four times a year to discuss company policy, and report separately to
the annual meeting.
Joe Lamb, apart from being a thorn in the flesh of the company, has
attracted considerable support to his Gas Greed Campaign, from small
shareholders unhappy with the company's profile.
Then the ethical investment consultancy PIRC is putting forward
Resolution 13, which calls on British Gas to revise its pay policy in
the light of best practice.
Both suggestions will probably be won on a show of hands. Meanwhile,
the directors will be stiffening their resolve by fingering the proxy
votes from the big institutions in their pockets. Strangely, while the
Conservative Party has thundered constantly about the undemocratic ways
of the block vote at TUC and Labour Party conferences, it has been
reticent to say anything critical about the block vote of the
institutions at annual meetings.
So once the show of hands is out of the way, the directors simply do a
count of votes, and with the institutions, not matter how reluctantly,
still backing them, the vociferous small shareholders will quite easily
be defeated arithmetically.
The SNP's Alex Salmond, who will be one of the chief opponents of the
directors on Wednesday, will have the proxy votes of 2000 small
shareholders on Wednesday, adding up to about 750,000 votes. But he
concedes that is a ''drop in the bucket'' compared with the many
millions of votes in the institutions.
A survey by the BBC's Money programme yesterday showed 17 major
institutional investors backing the board, seven planning to abstain and
only one planning to back Resolution 13.
But Alex Salmond did not expect it to be otherwise. The tactics are
for a longer battle than a spectacular, initial victory. First, he no
doubt wants to embarrass the directors, and that should not be too
difficult. ''I doubt if Giordano has ever spoken in front of 5000 people
before,'' he said yesterday. ''I have.''
Secondly, it will show the company, and others watching the
proceedings, that huge pay rises and other unattractive measures, can no
longer simply go through on the nod without attracting public
opprobrium. Thirdly, he is hoping that investors will start asking the
major institutions awkward questions about why they are investing in
specific companies.
''When I first wrote about British Gas, hundreds of people wrote to
me. You can tell, as a politician, when an issue just leaps from your
mailbag, and this was one of them. People wrote some lovely letters,
from all over the country, expressing their disgust and their contempt
at the directors grabbing so much while sacking thousands of workers and
closing showrooms. The contempt for them was absolutely scathing.
''It will be the mother of all shareholders' battles on Wednesday. But
the next step is to turn the words of anger against the pension
companies. Local authorities would be a good route, questioning their
investments.
''Ultimately I think the institutional investors will want changes.
They will say to Brown and Giordano that they cannot go on supporting a
company that attracts so much public odium. I don't think Brown and
Giordano are going to survive.''
There is no doubt that the directors, after much wounding criticism,
will win the battle on Wednesday. Whether they will win the war is still
open to question.

A NOVICE gold panner has won the Scottish championship at the first
attempt.
Mike Hall, 36, surprised his rivals after entering the competition to
gain experience in the hobby.
He was introduced to gold panning nine months ago by one of the
competitors he beat into third place in the final -- Mrs Yvonne Dallas,
39, of Edinburgh.
Hundreds of spectators went to Leadhills and Wanlockhead to watch the
gold panning.
Many visitors tried their luck at searching for gold in several nearby
burns after panning -- which normally requires a licence -- was made
free for the weekend.
The contestants stood in troughs of water erected in the playground of
Leadhills primary school. They sifted through measured buckets of sand
and gravel into which had been placed minuscule flakes of gold.
The winners were the ones who found the most flakes in the fastest
time.
Last night Mr Hall, a Royal Navy Petty Officer working in London,
said: ''I only entered to get lots more experience.
''I couldn't believe it when I won my heat and was even more surprised
at winning through the semi-final.
''I still can't believe I have won. I found all 11 flakes of gold in
my pan and so did my nearest rival, only I was seconds faster. Oddly
enough I didn't get anywhere in the British championship.''
The British championship was won by Mr Vince Thurkettle, 39, of
Norfolk.

WAR has always been the mother of invention. From the time the first
belligerent decided to remove himself from the range of his enemy's
sword-arm by using a slingshot, conflict has been the driving force of
man's ingenuity against his fellow man.
Four years of ethnic atrocity in the former Yugoslavia have served
merely to confirm and update that trend. As the supply of armaments from
outside sources slowed, but never quite halted, all sides have resorted
to creative devices to allow the slaughter to continue.
As the Provisional IRA proved in Ulster two decades ago, the humble
but effective mortar remains one of the easiest weapons to make. All one
needs is a launch tube with a firing pin and a supply of bombs. Apart
from the explosive content of the ammunition, the rest can be made in
any backyard machine-shop.
Modern armies have sophisticated aiming devices attached to their
mortars, enabling them to lay down a rapid, accurate, and devastating
barrage at a few minutes' notice. The British Army calls it its
''in-house artillery''.
Since the standard mortar round has a lethal radius of about 120ft,
accuracy is not a vital prerequisite. In an emergency, or in the absence
of mechanical sights, it is possible to launch a few bombs and correct
aim by observing their explosions.
Against infantry in the open or civilian streets, the rounds can be
''walked'' onto target. It takes a little longer, but the effect is just
the same. The ability to read a map and a little basic trigonometry can
short-circuit even that process.
Before Yugoslavia returned to mutual genocide after the historical
blip of Tito's reign, it was the fourth most heavily-armed conventional
power in Europe. Most of that impressive firepower in the form of tanks
and artillery was second-line Soviet equipment.
Military analysts think there is still enough lethal hardware
in-country to keep the protagonists fighting for the rest of this
century.
The Serbs, who ran the former Yugoslav national armed forces,
controlled most of it. But the Slovenes and Croats both contrived to
seize local arsenals before secession. Only the Muslims were left
without much heavy weaponry.
Improvisation is now the name of the game as all sides square up for
what threatens to be a summer of confrontation. But weapons and
equipment are still filtering through to all factions via the Adriatic
and the Danube frontier. The Western European Union's arms embargo has
been only a partial success.
It is common in that land of shifting alliances for Croats to turn a
blind eye and upturned palm to munitions destined for the Muslims of
Bosnia being landed at Split. Elsewhere, the Serbs have paid the Croats
to shell the Muslims.
The Serbs have so far shown most imagination. One of their more
innovative creations is a flying bomb launched from a crane topped by a
rail gantry. It consists of four 128mm rockets using the guidance system
intended for the Soviet-made Sagger anti-tank missile.
All sides have used anti-aircraft artillery in the direct fire role
against ground targets. That is hardly new. Germany's most effective
anti-tank gun during World War two was the feared 88mm Flak Kanone
designed for tackling bombers at high altitude. Its high-velocity
performance made it ideal for penetrating all but the thickest tank
armour.
Artillery in Croatia and Bosnia has probably accounted for most of the
250,000 deaths so far recorded. The Serbs, short of manpower and
fighting on a number of fronts, use it on a lavish scale. In fighting in
central Bosnia two weeks ago, the United Nations reported up to 2000
rounds a day landing on a single disputed area.
But that level of heavy-duty bombardment inevitably takes its own toll
on the guns themselves. Rifled barrels, the means of delivering accurate
fire at long range, wear out rapidly. They cannot be made in backstreet
workshops.
As a result, artillery pieces which should have a reach of 18 miles
often deliver considerably short of that distance. It imbues friendly
fire with the effect of Russian roulette, and given the origin of the
weapons, is highly appropriate.
The nature of the conflict on all fronts is decidedly Second World
War. Artillery is the dominant weapon system in the absence of effective
air forces. The Bosnian Muslims, strong in manpower, have seen offensive
after offensive grind to a halt in front of strong Serb positions
because of lack of artillery preparation.
Flesh and blood can achieve only so much. It takes a deluge of high
explosive to blast a passage for infantry through bunker and trench
lines, and that requires deployment of large numbers of heavy guns. The
Krajina and Bosnian Serbs field more than 1200 howitzers between them,
more than all the other combatants combined.
All sides have set up ammunition factories to churn out the huge
amount of munitions needed. Often, these plants have become the focus of
offensive and counter-offensive as the warring factions jostle for
temporary strategic advantage.
More than a quarter of a million Yugoslavs are dead or missing so far,
and the game has not yet hit its peak. Both Croats and Muslims have
spent the better part of a year turning ragtag militias into soldiers.
The Croat offensive to recover part of the Krajina -- the 30% of
Croatia seized by the Serbs in 1991 -- a few weeks ago is likely to be
the prelude to a spate of major attacks through the summer and into the
autumn. Only exhaustion, shortage of firepower, or the unthinkable
prospect of Serb concessions and withdrawals will halt those onslaughts.
On a make-do-and-mend but nonetheless savage battleground, only lack
of helicopter gunships and fighter-bombers has helped keep down the
casualty list to date. Civilians have sustained by far the bulk of the
losses in pointless terror attacks by shell and mortar fire.
No side will concede that there is no military solution. Serbia and
Montenegro could never allow the Bosnian Serbs to go under, whatever the
international pressure. But Croat and Muslim will never give up until
they have regained what they regard as their lost territory. The stage
is set for round two, and the real slaughter may just have begun.

<TEXT>
THE man ultimately responsible for the prosecution of O J Simpson
insisted today he would try the case a second time if necessary.
Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti was commenting after
another juror was dismissed from the trial, leaving only four substitute
jurors available.
Under California law, the defence must agree to a jury of fewer than
12 reaching a verdict.
Mr Garcetti, in London on a speaking engagement, said he was confident
the trial would still reach a conclusion despite the problems with the
jurors.
He said: ''I think the jury will reach a verdict. I'm confident of
that. The only unknown is if all of a sudden we have a number of jurors
who engage in jury misconduct.''
Mr Garcetti said a lot of time and expense had gone into the case and
every effort would be made to keep it on track.
He also claimed that Simpson's defence was on record as saying that it
would accept fewer than 12 jurors. However he added: ''Assuming that
neither side or both sides will not agree to fewer than 12 jurors, then
the trial will begin again.''
The dismissal of another juror on Thursday was a new blow to the
trial, which started in January with a full compliment of 12 jurors and
12 substitutes ready to hear the case against Simpson, who denies
murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald
Goldman.
Eight of the original jurors have fallen by the wayside and been
replaced by substitutes, leading to speculation that the whole process
could collapse.
However Mr Garcetti said he was determined to ensure that justice was
done in a case where two people had met ''violent and horrible'' deaths.

Rabat, Sunday
ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat
today reaffirmed their commitment to a July 1 deadline to agree on
expanded Palestinian self-rule.
After meeting in the Moroccan capital Rabat, they also pledged to
expand economic co-operation for the mutual benefit of Arabs and
Israelis as a motor for lasting peace in the Middle East.
Their joint communique said: ''The Israelis and the Palestinians
confirmed their real commitment to reach, before July 1, 1995, an
agreement on the second phase of the interim accord, including the
redeployment of (Israeli) troops, security arrangements, elections, the
transfer of authority, and the other points inscribed in the accords of
Oslo, Washington, and Cairo.''
The statement, which Moroccan officials described as positive, was
agreed during four hours of talks between Arafat and Peres in the
presence of Morocco's King Hassan.
It referred only in passing to what it called ''recent difficulties''
which had threatened an Arab backlash against Israel over its decision,
now suspended, to seize land in Arab East Jerusalem.
Moroccan newspapers recalled that the meeting between Peres and Arafat
at the royal palace in Rabat was held on the day that the Arabs had
planned a summit in Morocco before the Israeli Government backtracked on
the land decision.
The joint statement did not specifically mention Jerusalem, although
it was included by inference since the Oslo, Washington, and Cairo
accords containing the broad outlines of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord call for negotiations on the final status of the divided city
next year.
In Jerusalem itself today, tens of thousands of flag-waving Jews
marched to the Arab east to celebrate 28 years of Israeli rule over the
city.
The Israeli Government marked the annual Jerusalem Day festivities by
pledging in a Cabinet resolution to ''re-inforce the status of united
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel alone and . . . fight any attempt to
harm this status''.
Orient House, the PLO headquarters in Arab East Jerusalem, called
Israel's celebrations ''another obstacle'' on the road to peace.
''We are the master, we are the ruling power as the country in united
Jerusalem,'' Rabin said in a rare live broadcast by Israel Radio from
the weekly Cabinet meeting.
''And as a Jewish state we must be tolerant and grant civil rights to
all the citizens of united Jerusalem,'' he said, apparently still trying
to defuse tensions over the land issue.
The second phase of the 1993 Israeli-PLO interim accord is a year
behind schedule. The first phase, Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and the
West Bank enclave of Jericho, began a year ago.
Peres and Arafat set a target of July 1 to reach a framework agreement
for the second phase, which calls for redeployment of troops away from
Arab towns in the West Bank and Palestinian elections.
Peres, who left early today for the United States, said before the
meeting that the timetable was not the issue, but anti-Israeli violence
by Islamic guerrillas opposed to peace.
Arafat has not commented publicly on his second meeting with Peres in
days. An aide had described the peace process as faced with ''clinical
death''.--Reuter.

TORY activists in Scotland produced a whole raft of ideas at the
weekend, sometimes contradictory, in a frantic attempt to take the party
forward after the Perth and Kinross by-election defeat.
SNP leader Alex Salmond scathingly described the mixture as the
''headless chickens coming home to roost''.
Most of the suggestions were an attempt to square the circle of
standing strongly for the Union with England, but somehow making Scots
feel they had a greater say in their own affairs.
Many of them are unlikely to find enthusiastic backing from either the
Prime Minister or Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, who have eschewed
anything in the past which smacked of constitutional devolution.
One suggestion which could be acted upon is for more Government
administrative bodies to be headquartered in Scotland.
With the Scottish Grand Committee already having occasional meetings
in Scotland, Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate Struan
Stevenson wants to go one step further by having the entire Parliament
meeting in Scotland one week a year.
The massive disruption, with hundreds of MPs, secretaries and Commons
staff heading north, could be handled in the same way as the European
Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, he said.
Its merit would be that it would show that Scotland's place in the
Union as an equal partner was being recognised, he added.
Mr Arthur Bell, chairman of the wettish Scottish Tory Reform Group,
has suggested a constitutional conference, chaired by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Mackay, to investigate the future constitutional
arrangements. He said it would be an act of negligence to the point of
suicide if the Tory Party did not take the Perth and Kinross defeat
seriously.
A constitutional conference, he said, could come to sensible
conclusions that would find favour with the majority of Scots without
destroying the union -- which could happen if the Conservatives ignored
what had happened.
Another idea resurrected is for a Scottish senate, which Tayside MP
Bill Walker first suggested five years ago, in which local government
representatives would come together to advise the Scottish Secretary on
subjects such as roads, planning, and the spending of EU funds.
The suggestion was immediately criticised by Labour's Shadow Scottish
Secretary, Mr George Robertson, who said such a toothless body would be
a blueprint for disaster.
One further suggestion was made by right-wing novelist and
Conservative supporter Allan Massie. But it is not a suggestion that Ian
Lang is contemplating yet.
Massie says that if Labour does win an election with its devolution
plans then the Scottish Tories should consider becoming a party which
argues instead for Scottish independence.

Islamabad, Sunday
PAKISTAN cricket idol Imran Khan has hit back at critics of his
decision to marry 21-year-old Jemima Goldsmith.
''Never in my wildest dreams did I envisage a controversy such as
this,'' he wrote in an article published in Pakistani newspapers today.
''I suppose if my marriage proves one point, it is that I am not a
politician.''
Imran, who married Jemima in an Islamic ceremony in Paris on May 16,
said his choice of an English wife did not contradict his criticism of
the West or make him a hypocrite.
''I have never blamed the West for our present predicament. I blame us
(Pakistanis) for having allowed ourselves to be used by Western
countries,'' he wrote.
Imran, 42, said he stood by his criticism of the ''Brown Sahib'' elite
who had been educated into blindly imitating the West.
''I have neither abandoned my culture, nor have I decided to live in a
Western country. On the contrary, it is my wife who will be leaving her
well-publicised comforts to come and live in Pakistan,'' he wrote.
The couple, now on honeymoon in Spain and Italy, are to have a civil
marriage in London on June 20.
The former cricket captain, who retired after leading Pakistan to
victory in the 1992 World Cup, said he had always wanted ''ideally'' to
marry a Pakistani girl because life would be easier with someone from
the same background.
''However, life does not work as we expect it to. It just so happened
that the girl who shares my ideas, vision, and values happens to be an
English girl and if my father, sisters, and I are happy to welcome her
into our family, what right has anyone else to object?''
Imran, citing his experience in a cricket ball-tampering controversy,
said he had anticipated criticism from the British tabloid press.
''Since Islam is normally painted as such an uncivilised and backward
religion, most journalists cannot understand how an eligible,
intelligent, and educated young lady could convert to Islam and actually
consider living in an Islamic society.''
Reaction in the Pakistani press had been ''equally astonishing and
hurtful'' because his marriage had been turned into a scandal or even
treated as a ''Zionist plot''.
His bride's father, Sir James Goldsmith, is Jewish and her mother is a
Roman Catholic.
Imran, who has built a cancer hospital and adopted a high public
profile since ending his cricketing career, said his marital choice had
finally proved his lack of political ambition.
''The amusing thing is that the people who are saying it is the end of
my political career are those very same people who insisted in the first
place that I was coming into politics.''
He reserved his bitterest comment for some Pakistani politicians and
their ''pocket journalists'' who were having a field day condemning his
marriage and humiliating his family.
His wife has also chosen to answer critics of her marriage today,
saying in an interview with a British newspaper that the decision to
become a Muslim was entirely her own choice and ''in no way hurried''.
She said: ''Judging by some of the articles which have appeared in the
press, it would seem that a Western woman's happiness hinges largely
upon her access to nightclubs, alcohol, and revealing clothes, and the
absence of such apparent freedom and luxuries in Islamic societies is
seen as an infringement of her basic rights.
''However, as we all know, such superficialities have very little to
do with true happiness,'' she said.--Reuter.

Moscow, Sunday
RUSSIA said its forces attacked rebel positions in the foothills of
breakaway Chechnya today and witnesses said thousands of people were
fleeing their homes.
Military sources in the shattered capital Grozny were reported as
saying that Russian jets had attacked rebels at Vedeno and Shatoi in
Chechnya's mountainous south.
Crowds of people mobbed Moscow's administration in Grozny demanding
safe corridors be opened up to let women and children out of mountain
villages, Itar-Tass reported.
Roads to the villages had been blocked and thousands of civilians were
fleeing along forest paths at great risk to their lives, Tass said.
Thousands of civilians have been killed since December 11, when
President Boris Yeltsin sent troops and tanks to stop the mostly Muslim
region's three-year independence drive.
Russian forces have been bombing and shelling mountains in southern
Chechnya to prise fighters out of bases set up after they were driven
out of most of the lowlands.
Ruslan Khasbulatov, former Speaker of the Russian Parliament and
former arch-rival of Yeltsin, condemned Moscow's offensive and warned
that the fighting could spread.
''If serious and concerted efforts are not made to stop the war it
will continue and for sure it will inflame the whole region,'' said
Khasbulatov, a Chechen academic on a visit to Jordan.
He denounced Russia's political system as dictatorial and said the war
must be stopped, the troops withdrawn, and free elections held.
Peace talks in Grozny broke up after four hours on Thursday. Both
sides say they want to resume negotiations but blamed each other for the
weekend battles.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said the fighting was continuing, but
gave no more details. He accused the Chechens of failing to keep a
promise not to attack from towns and villages.
Usman Imayev, chief Chechen negotiator in the talks sponsored by the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said Russia
had attacked Vedeno, the Chechen military headquarters 30 miles
south-east of Grozny.
He accused the Russians of breaking agreements by carrying out two
days of air attacks on Vedeno and settlements nearby, killing 50
civilians and wounding 180. Both sides' casualty figures have turned out
to be unreliable in the past.
Today there was no word on the fate of five Russian soldiers reported
to have been taken prisoner.
Tass had quoted a Chechen rebel commander as saying the men would be
executed by last night unless Russian forces stopped bombing.
However Ekho Moskvy radio quoted another Chechen commander as denying
that the men would be killed.
It was the first report of such an ultimatum from the Chechen
side.--Reuter.

Kampala, Sunday
REBELS planning to overthrow Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni are
being backed by ousted dictator Idi Amin, a state-owned newspaper
reported today.
Amin, ousted in 1979 after ruling for more than eight years, is living
in Jeddah, where he was offered asylum by Saudi Arabia after fleeing
into exile.
The Sunday Vision said the rebels had been recruiting Muslim youths in
north-western Uganda -- Amin's tribal area -- for guerrilla training in
neighbouring Sudan.
The newspaper said Idi Amin was involved in the plot, which was also
backed by opposition politicians in Uganda.
It said 3000 recruits had already been taken from Arua and Nebbi
districts, which border Zaire, to a training centre in Morobo in
southern Sudan. They were taken to Sudan through Zaire, it said,
apparently to hide their destination from the Uganda authorities.
''The name of former president Idi Amin Dada is being used by the
recruiting agents, who are targeting the Muslim communities who are the
majority locally,'' said the report.
It said the recruitment exercise had caused fear and panic in the past
few months. Residents had fled villages on hearing reports that rebels
were advancing in their direction.
Local politicians say that Amin, despite his bloodthirsty reputation,
has a strong following among local Muslims who were favoured during his
rule.
The newspaper recently reported that Kenya, Sudan, and Zaire were
supporting plans to assassinate President Museveni, which they deny.
Uganda severed diplomatic relations with Sudan last month after
accusing Khartoum of supporting dissidents.--Reuter.

FIVE decades ago this year, a war-weary world took the first,
ambitious steps towards creating the political framework for lasting
global peace. The United Nations came into being in October, 1945, to
foster that aim.
Fifty years on, the dream has turned sour. Peacekeeping operations
have become a costly, ineffective embarrassment and the UN itself little
more than the Red Cross with rifles.
The organisation, while still well-intentioned, has deteriorated into
a bureaucratic shambles. Operations in critical troublespots such as
Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia, and Liberia are run by remote control from UN
headquarters in New York along a chain of command that bypasses any
sense of the reality of the situation on the ground.
The United States, the most powerful member, shows every sign of
economic and political retrenchment. Its one genuinely altruistic
attempt to provide aid and stability to the people of Somalia ended in
ignominious retreat and needless casualties.
The US troops who landed on the Port-au-Prince beach amid a blaze of
publicity tried hard to end the rule of local warlords. The bottom line
was that their attempts were resented by the very Somalis who had
originally welcomed them. More than 20 American Servicemen died, and
their heavy-handed response with helicopter gunships served only to mire
them deeper in a conflict that was none of their business in the first
place.
Their huffy withdrawal, and naive comments that the Somalis had acted
like dogs who bite the hand that feeds them, also provided some
dangerous lessons for every tinpot dictator or minor warlord worldwide
and delivered yet another blow to UN credibility.
Anyone who wants to scotch US military involvement under the UN banner
knows that all he has to do is kill a few of them or take hostages. And
if that can be done with accompanying television footage and utmost
brutality, so much the better.
In US political circles, the bodybag factor is all-important. The
American public has become used to small wars with not many dead. Any
move which revives the psychological nightmare of a Vietnam-style
imbroglio is political suicide.
What UN policy fails to address is that different countries have
different thresholds of pain. No nation wants its Servicemen to die for
lost causes or on missions that are subsequently abandoned. But some,
including Britain and France, are more willing than others to risk
casualties if the possibility of peaceful resolution or successful
humanitarian relief exists.
Since 1948, when UN peacekeeping missions began in earnest, more than
750 Blue Berets have been killed on humanitarian duty abroad. Of these,
300 have died as a direct result of hostile action and the others in
accidents. So far, Somalia has claimed 113 lives, and the former
Yugoslavia 90-plus, including eight Britons.
On only three occasions has the full military might on call to the UN
been brought into play under Chapter Seven of the organisation's
charter, the ultimate carte blanche for intervention on a grand scale.
The first was Korea in 1950, the second the 1991 Gulf war, and the third
Somalia last year.
Korea, more a product of US determination to halt what it perceived as
the spread of international communism, ended in bloody stalemate after
three years of fighting. The Chinese had entered the fray by then, and
Allied dead numbered more than 50,000. China lost a million men.
The Gulf war cost fewer than 300 combat dead on the Allied side, and
anywhere betwen 10,000 and 40,000 on the Iraqi side. More Allied troops
were killed in traffic mishaps than in action.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union's power bloc, large-scale armed
intervention on a similar scale to either of these conflicts is
unlikely. But the UN has been overtaken by a new form of warfare for
which it has neither mandate nor policy.
The organisation, riven by vested interest and ethnic rivalry, has
already shown itself incapable of dealing with the spate of localised
civil wars that have been the hallmark of the end of the cold war.
Bosnia is the prime example, with a death toll among the participants
that has exceeded 200,000 in just over two years.
While it is beyond dispute that UN food and medical aid has saved many
lives in the conflict, the military role of the peacekeeping contingents
has been markedly less successful.
Major-General Lewis Mackenzie, the Canadian who resigned as military
commander in Bosnia because of the UN's lack of co-ordination and
resolve, thinks an initial show of force might have staved off the
slaughter that ensued.
''If the UN had had the determination to prevent Bosnia blowing up in
its face, it should have committed a division right at the outset to
interpose troops in strength between the potential belligerents.
''By the time a decision was taken, the fighting had broken out and it
was too late. The early commitment of 15,000 well-armed peacekeepers
could have stopped, or at least minimised, the civil war now raging,''
he said.
By definition, the way in which the UN operates at senior level in New
York dictates that few decisions will be taken fast. Prevarication by
countries unwilling to risk lives or financial resources, and delay and
dissent by allies of combatants, are always going to act as a brake on
effective or timely action.
The entire process is not helped by the fact that official posts in
New York are doled out on a pro-rata basis to contributing nations.
In keeping with national traditions, many of these supposedly
responsible positions are given to less-than-competent relatives of the
rulers of a number of Third World members. It is not calculated to
improve efficiency, or to dispel frequent accusations of misuse of funds
or aid supplies.
The UN has been overtaken by events. Its administrative structure
needs a complete overhaul, and it desperately requires a permanent
military command set-up to direct operations in flashpoint areas.
In Croatia three years ago, the UN commander trying to broker peace
between a myriad of warring militias had a nominal nine battalions under
his command, allocated from all over the world by bureaucrats in New
York. In practice he had only three combat-effective outfits.
There was a 1000-man Canadian regular battalion, about 800 French
Marines and some British-trained Jordanian troops. The others were a
waste of space, time, and scarce resources.
They included a Russian battalion whose members had not been paid for
upwards of two months, and who were looting for food. There was also a
Nigerian unit who, to be brutally honest, had little idea of where they
were, never mind why.
The majority of contingents operated to different military
philosophies, used different calibre ammunition, ate different rations,
and had varying degrees of sympathy with the active participants.
It was a force cobbled together in New York, where considerations like
effectiveness on the ground tend to dim into insignificance beside the
imperative for united international action -- as seen to be performed
from a distance.
If the UN is to have future pretensions of being able to preserve or
impose peace on a fragmenting world, then a number of considerations
have to be addressed.
The United States, as the last superpower, must be involved. Even if
it does not commit ground troops, its network of worldwide bases, its
vast air and sealift capabilities, and the incalculable value of its
intelligence-gathering apparatus are vital to any major military
operation.
Manpower is less essential. Europe, particularly a Europe in which
Germany should take its rightful place as a physical as well as
financial force, could provide trained and disciplined troops in
conjunction with Canada, Turkey, Russia, Japan, and Latin America.
The Russian connection would be a prudent step, even if it did not
involve the commitment of ground forces. Given Chechnya and the spate of
minor insurrections and ethnic civil wars waiting in the wings on its
former territory, the involvement of Russian troops could be a
disadvantage.
But Moscow's blessing and, more importantly, its non-interference, in
genuine peacemaking ventures would be a prerequisite for success.
Breaking UN embargoes to smuggle weapons to the Bosnian Serbs has not
helped raise Russia's peaceful profile. The all-out assault on Grozny
has done it a positive disservice.
For the UN, the question has a date-stamped rendezvous with history.
Unless it can get its act together, and decide collectively that
interference in internal wars is frequently not only desirable but
necessary, it will go the way of the League of Nations.
With the Bosnian Serbs in aggressive mode, the withdrawal of all UN
troops is now a distinct possibility. But the pull-back routes for the
men trying to keep the peace are in range of Serb artillery. An orderly
retreat might easily be blocked or at least imperilled. All routes back
to the coast for an orderly disengagement lead through Croatia.
If the UN accedes to Bosnian Serb pressure, it will open the way to
the unravelling of its entire Yugoslavian strategy, such as it is, and a
resumption of the three-cornered ethnic war on a wider front.
A major conflict in Yugoslavia has all the potential for a spill-over
into Greece, the involvement of Turkey, and a comeback for the Balkans
as the cockpit of Europe. Even Russia might be dragged in as a reluctant
Serbian ally.
On a short timescale, any vast improvement in the UN's posture is
unlikely. But events must surely concentrate the minds of its diplomats
on the urgency of establishing an effective military command and a
legitimate mandate for deploying effective military forces to prevent
even internal conflict.
It has been done and it could be done again. It would, however, be a
prime requirement that next time it should not appear to be an operation
in pursuit of US foreign policy.
The pieces are already on the board and ready to be picked up. Nato,
or an expanded Nato, is desperately seeking a role in a changing world.
The initial military structure and forces are there in place. All that
the UN lacks now is resolve, and that most fundamental of its basic
founding precepts, unity.

FORMER prime minister Lord Wilson is to be buried on June 6 on the
Isles of Scilly where he and Lady Wilson spent holidays during their
Downing Street years.
The family have picked a plot in the graveyard alongside a quiet beach
on St Mary's -- the largest island in the group.
The graveyard surrounds the tiny 900-year-old church of St Mary the
Virgin, where Lord Wilson, who died in a London hospital on Wednesday,
attended candlelight evening services as long as his health permitted.
The Wilsons took up residence on St Mary's, with its population of
about 1500, and Lady Wilson regularly attends services at the church.
''You couldn't find a more picturesque place than where the grave will
be,'' said the Rev Michael Phillips, Anglican rector and chaplain of the
Isles of Scilly, who will officiate.
The church can seat only 64, and the funeral service will be held in
the much larger parish church -- also St Mary the Virgin -- opened in
the 1830s.
For years Lord Wilson used to read the lesson on Easter Day in the
parish church, and was also often in the congregation at the island's
Methodist church.
The islands' Methodist minister, the Rev Brian Mavers, will give a
short address at the funeral service. The eulogy will be given by Lord
Tonypandy, former Speaker of the House of Commons.
Detailed arrangements were still being made, said Father Phillips --
he said reports that it was originally intended to hold the service this
week were mistaken -- and it was not known whether political leaders
would attend.
He added that Lord Wilson's body would be brought to the island on the
day before the funeral and rest overnight in the parish church.

Madrid, Sunday
SPAIN'S conservative Popular Party (PP) won a resounding victory over
the ruling Socialists in municipal and regional elections today,
according to exit polls.
They gave the PP a margin of victory which seemed certain to change
the balance of power radically at the country's political grass roots.
Today's polls were widely seen as a run-up to a PP win in General
Elections which could be called as early as next year.
The Socialists, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, have held the
national government in Madrid since 1982. They currently control seven
of the 13 regions and govern another in coalition.
One poll, broadcast by an independent radio station, said the PP won
an overall 46% of the vote in elections for 13 of the country's 17
autonomous regional parliaments and more than 8000 town councils,
against 28% for the Socialists.
This compared with a Socialist victory of 38.4% to 25.2% over the PP
in 1991 in the last local elections.
The exit polls predicted that the PP, which has surged in popularity
in the last 18 months against a government party dogged by corruption
scandals and economic ills, would have an absolute majority in the key
Madrid region, ousting its minority Socialist government.
The conservatives would also comfortably retain the mayorship of the
Spanish capital, polls indicated.
A poll for state television indicated that the PP, led by Jose Maria
Aznar, would have an absolute majority in six of the 13 regions voting,
overturning a Socialist government in all but two.
Polls generally showed the PP taking a relative majority in at least
four more regions, with the Socialists hanging on only in their western
Spanish redoubt of Extremadura with a sharply reduced vote.
In two more important Socialist-held regions, Valencia and Castilla-La
Mancha, the PP was forecast to take the biggest share of the vote but
fall short of an absolute majority.
The communist-led United Left coalition was seen as increasing its
share of the nationwide vote to around 12% from 8.5% in 1991.
It could play a vital role in post-electoral dealing to form
governments where no-one has an absolute majority, with the Socialists
the most likely beneficiaries.
In the big cities, the Socialists' only success was predicted in the
Catalan capital of Barcelona, where mayor Pasqual Maragall was thought
to have narrowly defeated Miguel Roca of the Catalan national party.
The Andalusian capital of Seville saw a virtual tie between the PP and
Socialist candidates, which was likely to mean that the Andalusian
nationalist mayor would be re-elected with conservative backing.
Polls said the centre-right would take the mayorship of the Aragon
capital of Zaragoza from the Socialists. Only in the northern fishing
city of La Coruna did the popular Socialist mayor retain his absolute
majority, according to polls.
PP spokesman Mariano Rajoy was jubilant. ''The political map has
clearly changed in favour of the Popular Party,'' he told a news
conference.
He said PP data showed the party as the first force in 11 of the 13
regions which voted and winning in more than 40 of 52 provincial
capitals at stake.
''This is a clear triumph and a considerable loss of electoral support
for the Socialists.''
Socialist administration chief Cipria Ciscar acknowledged the PP
victory, but said he was confident his party would do better overall
than in last year's European Parliament polls, when they took 30.7% of
the vote to 40.2 for the PP.
Aznar had said he will step up pressure on Gonzalez to call early
elections, at present due in 1997, if the PP won a big victory.--Reuter.

THE Prime Minister defended his policies on a range of issues
yesterday as Baroness Thatcher dealt him a fresh blow by stating that Mr
Tony Blair was the best Labour leader for more than 30 years.
In comments which follow what was seen as criticism of Mr Major in the
second volume of her memoirs, she described Mr Blair as probably the
most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell, who died in 1963.
Her words are in sharp contrast to the Prime Minister's disparaging
assessment of Mr Blair as a ''soundbite'' politician whose new Labour
Party was ''pre-packaged like soap powder''.
They will infuriate senior Tories who believe Lady Thatcher is
undermining Mr Major's authority in the party and the country. Her
comments, in an interview in the Sunday Times, suggest she regards Mr
Blair as a superior performer to Labour's intervening five leaders --
Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, and John
Smith.
Her implied criticism of Mr Major was underlined yesterday with
further extracts from her book, published in the Sunday Times. On
Europe, she said she was not prepared for the speed with which the
position she had adopted would be ''entirely reversed'', and she said
the Government should declare now that it was against a single currency
to ''demonstrate our principled dissent from the federalist objectives
of most other European governments''.
Lady Thatcher also said Britain could not continue to ignore the
erosion of its parliamentary sovereignty.
There was a strong case for amending the 1972 European Communities Act
to establish the ultimate supremacy of Parliament over community law,
making clear that Parliament can, by express provision, override it.
Mr Major, however, in an article in the Sunday Express, pledged to
fight the next General Election with tried and tested Tory principles
and promised tax cuts ''as soon and as far as is prudent''.
On Europe, he vowed to retain Britain's sovereignty and protect the
country's right to govern itself from Westminster and not Brussels.
''That was why it was right for me to fight and win bitter arguments
-- to curb what Brussels does, limit how much it spends, cut red tape,
open new markets, increase trade and bring in new members,'' he said.
Turning to the economy, he argued that people would have ''scoffed''
two years ago if he had predicted it would grow at the rate it had and
that unemployment would fall so dramatically.
* The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, who has appeared
recently to be making overtures towards the Labour Party, said yesterday
it did not deserve the mantle of power.
He told Sky TV: ''Labour, in its present position, is not fit to be
trusted with the government of this country. Labour is still tied to the
trade unions. Secondly, a government of this country has to renew and
refresh our democracy. Labour can't even have a democracy in its own
party, let alone be trusted with democracy in the country.''

THE Queen attended a service to mark the 100th anniversary of the
royal family's adopted Scottish church yesterday.
Crathie Kirk sits on a hilltop on Royal Deeside overlooking the
Queen's 50,000-acre Balmoral estate.
Generations of royals have worshipped there while holidaying at
Balmoral and it was the venue for Princess Anne's 1992 wedding to
Commander Timothy Lawrence.
The foundation stone of the building was laid by Queen Victoria in
1893 and it was dedicated in her presence 100 years ago.
Yesterday's service was taken by the Rev Keith Angus, who is due to
retire at the end of this year after 16 years at Crathie.
The clergyman has become a close friend and confidante of the royals
and officiated at Princess Anne's wedding.
The kirk is a traditional cross-shaped building made of grey granite
with pine woodwork. The royals have their own private section, the south
transept, where they can worship out of sight of the rest of the
congregation.

THE Monster Raving Loony Party was offered a heaven-sent lifeline
yesterday after bookmakers William Hill guaranteed it financial support.
However, its debt-ridden leader, Screaming Lord Sutch, who could face
bankruptcy over a court action against him, warned that his political
career and that of his maverick party could still be over.
William Hill has agreed to fund the political costs of the party --
which came fifth at Perth and Kinross -- for all future by-elections
''up to and including the next General Election''.
It said it would also pay an ''undisclosed four-figure sum'' to boost
party funds. But it will not underwrite Lord Sutch's personal #194,000
debt, for which Barclays Bank has issued a civil writ to recover.
William Hill made the offer because of a ''long-term relationship''
with Lord Sutch, who regularly places bets on himself to receive a set
number of votes in elections.
Lord Sutch said yesterday the offer was ''great news'' for the party,
but emphasised that, if he was declared bankrupt, he himself would be
banned from standing for Parliament.
The 54-year-old rock 'n' roll artist ran up the debt after a house
deal went wrong, but said at the weekend that he intended to fight the
writ.

A GOVERNMENT led by Mr Tony Blair should avoid a ''gut reaction'' to
undo all Tory health reforms, two of Labour's key advisers on social
policy said yesterday.
Their intervention is an embarrassment for Mr Blair, who has pledged a
Labour government would abolish the NHS internal market.
It also comes as the Shadow Health Secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett,
prepares to publish a document next month detailing Labour's plans to
scrap GP fundholding, which the party claims has led to a two-tier
health service.
Professor Brian Abel-Smith, former adviser to the last Labour Health
Secretary, David -- now Lord -- Ennals, and Mr Howard Glennerster, a
social policy expert, said there was overwhelming evidence that GP
fundholders were able to get a ''better deal for their patients''.
Writing in the June Fabian Review, the two said: ''There is an obvious
temptation for Labour to cash in on public concern and promise to undo
every change the Tories have made. Such a gut reaction should be
resisted.''
Dismissing arguments that fundholding should be abolished, they said:
''Should patients choosing to register with a fundholder be deprived of
the advantages they have won? Surely it makes much more sense to build
on what has been achieved and induce more and more GPs to join the
system.''
Conceding the need for some hospital closures, they said: ''Parts of
Britain have a surplus of hospital beds. There is nothing new about
hospital closure. It has been going on relatively quietly under
successive governments. The problem of excess beds would have to be
grasped by any government, however the health service is run.''
On the internal market, they said: ''Making hospitals compete for
custom keeps them on their toes. Markets give choice and eventually make
providers respond to the choices made.''
They also welcomed trust status, ''bringing authority down to hospital
level and giving managers much more power to manage are important steps
to enable hospitals to become patient centered''.
However, Mr Hugh Bayley, a Labour member of the Commons health
committee and formerly a health economist at York University, said:
''The internal market has been a costly flop and should be scrapped.''
Writing in the Fabian Pamphlet, he said the NHS internal market was
''incompatible in principle with Labour's objective of equity and in
practice with the objectives of efficiency and accountability''.
He urged publication of league tables -- which Tory MPs are certain to
point out are a key feature of Tory-initiated reforms -- to show how
effective doctors were at curing patients. For example, he said,
prostate patients at Moray Hospital Trust were 13 times more likely to
be readmitted because surgery failed than those at Perth and Kinross.

Cambridge, Sunday
TWO medical students at Harvard University died today and a visitor
was injured in an apparent murder-suicide in a dormitory.
Ethiopian Sinedu Tadesse, 20, allegedly fatally stabbed her room-mate
Trang Ho, 20, of Medford, Massachusetts, before barricading herself in a
bathroom and hanging herself, legal sources said.
Ho died of multiple stab wounds in her room at Harvard and Tadesse was
dead on arrival at Cambridge City Hospital, said assistant district
attorney Martin Murphy.
Ho's friend, Thao Nguyen, 26, of Lowell, Massachusetts, who was
sleeping overnight in the room as a guest, was injured coming to her
aid. She was treated for stab wounds and released from the hospital.
''The stabbing apparently was without any prior quarrel or
altercations, at least on this day,'' Murphy said.
Harvard has declined to comment on the incident but said Harvard
President Neil Rudenstine would talk to students.--Reuter.

DAKAR: Four French tourists missing since April 6 in southern Senegal
are dead, according to rebels. The bodies of French couples Catherine
and Claude Cave and Jean Paul and Martine Gagnaire had not yet been
found but were apparently buried in Senegal, according to a rebel who
had sought refuge in Guinea Bissau. The French Foreign Ministry said
their vehicle had been found.
Rebels fighting for independence in the Casamance province have been
implicated in their disappearance, but deny any involvement. The
Senegalese Government, which relies on tourism for much of its foreign
exchange, had offered a reward for information about the couples and
sent 1000 special troops to hunt for them.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S newest ski resort, on 3999ft Aonach Mor, near Fort William,
is to expand in a scheme that will ultimately cost millions of pounds.
The operators of the Nevis Range ski centre announced at the weekend
that they had more than doubled the area they controlled. The resort,
catering for around 130,000 skiers per season, opened in 1989 at a cost
of #12.5m.
On Saturday Nevis Range's managing director, Mr Ian Sykes, revealed
that the company had secured a long-term lease on a further 900 acres of
neighbouring high ground with good snow-holding capability.
This is in addition to the centre's already-developed 700 acres, which
were also long-leased from British Alcan Highland Smelters, which
previously controlled the upland as part of its hydro-electric scheme.
Mr Sykes said the extra land would allow ''literally dozens'' of extra
ski runs to be installed on the north side of the mountain, next to
4406ft Ben Nevis.
A start will be made in developing the new area's potential this
summer with an investment of #500,000.
A similar sum will be spent next year to complete the first phase of
the expansion.
Mr Sykes said that Nevis Range, where primary uplift is by 1.5 mile
long overhead cableway carrying 80 six-seater gondolas, intended to
develop the whole of its new area gradually in a multi-million pound
rolling programme over several years.

The 14-tonne structure, nicknamed the ''human catapult'', hurls
intrepid volunteers into the sky from 0-60mph in two seconds.
It comes from California, and takes a day to assemble. It is being
hailed as the latest craze in reverse-style bungee jumping.
After his flight, a shaky Mr Gallie -- whose endeavours raised #1000

Ride controller Colin Titford warned that Sky Rider was not for the

He said: ''Everyone has to sign a medical certificate beforehand.
Pregnant women and those with a heart condition are advised against
it.''

THE eighth fire to hit their top-floor flat in the past 18 months left
10-year-old handicapped twin sisters fighting for their lives last night
in hospital.
Marion and Elizabeth Livingstone, of Harefield Drive, Scotstoun,
Glasgow, suffered severe smoke inhalation. Their condition was described
as ''critical but stable'' in intensive care in the city's Yorkhill
Hospital.
Their parents, Mr Graham Livingstone, 39, a security guard, and his
wife, Elizabeth, 35, were taken to the Western Infirmary, suffering from
smoke inhalation, but were later discharged.
Last night police and fire services were still investigating the cause
of the blaze, which broke out in the living room of the Livingstones'
four-in-a-block flat just before 3am.
It was the eighth fire in the flat since November 30, 1993. On this
occasion The Herald understands that the blaze, which badly damaged the
flat, was caused by a dropped light.
Mr Rab Coke, Strathclyde assistant firemaster, said that the previous
seven fires had all been relatively small. The family had been taken to
hospital on four different occasions after fires in the flat had been
caused by dropped lights, a kitchen appliance, and a television set
going up in flames.
Police said that they were looking at the fires, but there was nothing
to suggest that there had been anything suspicious about them.
Mr Coke said that on this occasion the family owed their lives to a
smoke detector, which had gone off in the hallway.
He said that the parents had managed to escape, but had been prevented
by toxic smoke from going back into the flat to try to rescue their
children. However, firefighters wearing breathing apparatus had managed
to knock the fire down and rescue the children.
Mr Edward Heaney, station officer at Knightswood fire station, said
the fire was well alight when his men got there -- within four minutes
of having taken a 999 call.
''They had to resuscitate the children with oxygen. One of the girls
didn't have a pulse, and it took quite a while to bring her round.''
Ten firefighters and two senior officers brought the blaze under
control within about 40 minutes.
Mrs Anne Mitchell, who lives in the ground-floor flat on the opposite
side from the Livingstones, was woken by her upstairs neighbour just
before 3am.
She said: ''I heard a rumpus. I thought at first it was a fight. Nosey
me pulled back the curtains for a look, but realised it was my neighbour
who was shouting that smoke was coming through her walls.
''She had phoned the police and the fire brigade. I could hear the
Livingstones screaming, but not the children.
''When the fire brigade arrived I told them that the children were
trapped in the bedroom. The firemen got them out and started working on
them. The poor wee souls were lying on the pavement for ages.''
Mrs Mitchell said there had been a number of fires at the
Livingstones' house. ''We wrote to our councillor and he got in touch
with the council. I believe they are giving it urgent attention.
''I don't want the family put out or rehoused. I'm not asking for the
moon, only that they be given help. I think the fires are a cry for
help.''
The chairman of Scotstoun Community Council, Mr Billy Ward, said he
had been approached by neighbours, worried about their own safety and
that of the Livingstones.
He said: ''The people who have come to me say it is a cry for help. I
went to the district council six weeks ago and warned them of the
neighbours' great concern and the fear that there could be a death. I
hope to God I'm not proved right.
''I don't know what we can do, but eviction is not the answer. I think
a social worker should be called in now, if it's not too late.''
Another neighbour, Mrs Linda Murphy, 37, who lives beneath the
Livingstones, said she had heard a noise just before 3am. She had then
smelled smoke and got her son and daughter dressed and led them to
safety.
Mrs Murphy is currently trying to sell her house and said she did not
want to say too much about the incident.
* A holidaymaker died early yesterday and her husband escaped when
fire raged through their touring caravan. The couple were staying on a
camp site at Studley Royal, a beauty spot near Ripon, North Yorkshire.
Mrs Anne Mason, 47, of Golders Green, London, and her husband, David,
76 -- who was treated for smoke inhalation and shock at nearby Harrogate
Hospital -- had travelled to the site for the bank holiday weekend, said
a police spokesman.
Firefighters put out the blaze, which virtually destroyed the caravan.

Madrid, Sunday
SPAIN'S centre-right Popular Party (PP) scored a resounding victory
over Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's ruling Socialists today in
regional and municipal elections.
Popular Party leader Jose Maria Aznar said his party's triumph in 10
of 13 regions and 42 of 52 provincial capitals would pave the way for
the conservatives to oust the Socialists in the next General Election,
widely expected to be held next year.
''We have obtained a clear and ample victory,'' Aznar told thousands
of flag-waving supporters outside his party's Madrid headquarters. ''We
have opened the door to hope for Spain -- we have reached the
next-to-last step, the next will be the governnent of Spain.''
Official returns with 93.12% of the vote counted gave the Popular
Party 35.03% of the vote in more than 8000 municipalities, a gain of
just under 10% since the last municipal elections in 1991.
The Socialists maintained control of Barcelona, the country's second
city, while the Popular Party strengthened its hold on Madrid, the
nation's capital and largest city.
The Socialists won 30.85% of the vote compared to 38.40% in 1991,
while the communist-led United Left won 11.79%, up from 8.46%.
Official returns for regional governments with an average of 70% of
votes counted showed the Popular Party leading in eight of the 13
regions.
Exit polls conducted by four different organisations indicated the
Popular Party would control at least 10 of the 13 regional governments
being contested, up from two in 1991.
While acknowledging defeat, Gonzalez told supporters that the
Socialist Party had recovered some of its popularity since the Popular
Party defeated it by a margin of 10% in last year's voting for the
European Parliament.
''The Popular Party has won in general terms, and we who know how to
win and lose congratulate them on their success,'' he said. However he
added that the results showed the Socialists retained ''a magnificent
electoral base.
''I tell all Socialists we will continue fighting for justice,
liberty, equality, and that we're going to do it with the intention of
winning the next election in 1997,'' Gonzalez said.
The General Election is not officially due until 1997, but it is
considered likely that they will be called next year.
Gonzalez's minority government has relied on the backing of a small
party from the northeastern Catalunya region since the Socialists lost
their majority in June 1993. That party, the conservative Convergence
and Union, has said early elections would be a good idea once Spain's
six-month presidency of the European Union ends on December 31.
Support for Gonzalez's party has been weakened by a succession of
corruption scandals involving Socialist politicians and appointees.
Among them are several former senior law enforcement officials who have
been charged this year with involvement in death squads that murdered
Basque separatists in the 1980s.
Socialist spokesman Cipria Ciscar predicted the Popular Party will be
able to form governments in five regions, while the others will have to
be governed by coalition or pacts.
He cautioned that control of many municipalities would also depend on
coalition pacts. The Socialists currently govern several city councils
with the support of the communist-led United Left, Spain's third-largest
party, which also appeared to have gained support today at the
Socialists' expense.
The Socialists, who have held the national government in Madrid since
1982, currently control seven of the 13 regions and govern another in
coalition. Four of Spain's 17 autonomous regions were not electing
parliaments today.
Voter turn-out was 69% of some 32 million voters, up by 7% over 1991,
with 93% of the vote counted.--AP.

<HEADLINE>Twelve weeks of searching ends with macabre discovery floating in a Cairngorm loch. Lost climbers trapped in a tomb of ice</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978157832</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RESCUERS worked for nearly eight hours at the weekend to free two
bodies from a floating ice tomb in the middle of a loch in the
Cairngorms.
The two young climbers, who had died under tons of snow when they were
caught in an avalanche in March, were found on Saturday by a party of
hillwalkers who spotted them floating in the loch encased in ice.
Mr Graeme Holland, 22, from Crossthwaite, Keswick, Cumbria, and Mr
Alan Mitchell, also 22, from Keswick, are understood to have been swept
700ft down the mountainside and into the loch.
The unemployed pair were reported missing after failing to return from
a climb on March 4. Rescuers carried out a widespread but vain search in
appalling weather for the men, who did not leave details of their
intended route.
The pair were making their descent, having reached the 4000ft plateau
in Coire an Lochain, when they were hit by an avalanche.
More than 100 rescuers scoured the northern Cairngorms for the pair
with Cairngorm Mountain Rescue team joined by RAF teams from Leuchars
and Kinloss and 12 sniffer dogs and handlers. Braemar Mountain Rescue
Team also carried out a search of the southern Cairngorms as the hunt
widened and intensified.
The search was hampered by blizzards, strong winds, poor visibility,
and a high avalanche risk which also ruled out the use of a helicopter.
Another huge hunt for the climbers' bodies was due to be mounted next
weekend.
However, on Saturday a party of hillwalkers spotted an object in an
ice floe in the loch at 3000ft and discovered it was a body encased in
ice.
Police in Aviemore were alerted and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team
went to the scene and discovered a second body close to the first but
hidden beneath the ice.
The rescuers then had to carry out the delicate and dangerous
operation of standing on the moving ice floe and hacking their way
through the ice with snow swords and ice axes to reach the bodies.
A call was made for a helicopter to take the bodies off the hill, but
no aircraft was available. The 19-strong Cairngorm team then had to
summon back-up. Six people from the Glenmore Lodge outdoor centre near
Aviemore and five members of Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team helped to
stretcher the bodies to ground level.
The operation began around 4.30pm on Saturday. Rescuers did not get
off the mountain until after midnight.
The Cairngorm team leader, Mr John Allen, said: ''They may have been
avalanched on the night they went missing and it is likely they were
subsequently avalanched again by one of the many avalanches in the area
at that time.
''They could have been caught in one avalanche and then swept into the
loch a few days later, but there would have been tons and tons and tons
of snow.
''It does appear they were coming off the hill having finished their
technical climb when they were swept about 600 or 700ft.''
Because the climbers had not left details of their route, the
searchers had no chance of finding them. ''We had no idea where they had
gone so, basically, we had no idea where to search.
''But even had we known where to search we would not have found them.
We have had hundreds of people and dogs in the area since then as late
as last week. But even in the past few days the snow was knee deep.
''We have had masses of snow in April and May and it is only now, with
the weather improving and the snow disappearing, that the discovery has
been possible.''
Mr Allen said the climbers were well equipped and, other than failing
to leave a route, had not made any mistakes. ''The evidence we have is
that they were doing everything right.
''They were perfectly well equipped and they were navigating off the
plataeu, we assume at night time, when they were avalanched.''
He said the recovery operation was unusual and treacherous as the ice
floe, like a small iceberg in the loch, was only around 30-40 metres
wide and less than one metre thick in places.
''We had to go on to the ice floe itself, which was moving about quite
a bit, and then get them out of the ice and on to dry land. At one stage
the ice floe broke completely free and was floating in the middle of the
loch with six of the rescue team and the bodies on it.''
Mr Allen said the recovery of the bodies was very important to the
mountain rescue team as well as for the bereaved families.
''It is very important that the families get their boys back so they
can have a proper burial. That was always one of the prime reasons for
finding them.
''Also we wanted to find them because it has been hanging over our
heads for the past few months. We have been trying but it's been very
frustrating because of the amount of snow we have had.
''Although we knew what the end would be we are relieved that this is
it closed now.''

In Cannes
TWO British stars, Helen Mirren and Jonathan Pryce, were last night
the toast of Cannes -- he in the flesh, she in her absence. They won the
Best Actor and Actress prizes respectively at the 48th Cannes
International Film Festival.
Mirren won her prize for her role as George III's queen in The Madness
of King George directed by Nicholas Hytner, and Pryce for his
performance as Lytton Strachey in Carrington, directed by Christopher
Hampton.
Hampton's film also won a special jury prize. But otherwise it was a
bad night for Britain. There was nothing for Ken Loach's Land and
Freedom, a story about the Spanish Civil War, or John Boorman's Beyond
Rangoon, which dealt with the civil unrest in 1988 under the military
junta.
The Cannes jury, chaired by the actress Jeanne Moreaux, opted instead
for the two films dealing with the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
They gave the Palm D'Or, the top prize, to Underground directed by the
Yugoslav Emir Kusturica, a no-holds-barred story in glorious
technicolour which follows the fortunes of two men and a woman from the
years of the Nazi occupation to the present day.
They gave the Grand Prix to Ulysses Gaze directed by a Greek director
Theo Angelopoulos, a careful balance because the films offend different
sides in the wars currently being waged there.
It was bad luck for Ken Loach whose Land and Freedom had been
considered to be a strong contender. He shared the international critics
prize, which is awarded outside the festival, with Mr Angelopoulos, and
he also won the prize given by the Ecumenical Jury. He found that prize
rather amusing since in the film a priest is killed.
Pryce, who is appearing in London in the musical Oliver, was able to
accept his award because the show does not play on Sunday. He said he
had played many complex and complicated roles in the theatre -- Hamlet,
Macbeth, and roles written by Chekhov.
''I waited 20 years to play a part as complex as Lytton Strachey.
Apart from my writer and director Christopher Hampton I have to thank
one person especially and I hope I did justice to his life. I had a
better time playing him than he had living him. My regards to Lytton
Strachey.''
There is also some consolation for Scotland in Carrington's success.
One of its producers was John McGrath.
Helen Mirren is appearing in a play in America and the task of
collecting her award went to her co-star, Nigel Hawthorne, who played
the king. The award was presented by actor Hugh Grant.
''This single gesture to the movie is a tribute to a marvellous film
of which we are all incredibly proud,'' Hawthorne said. Then he slipped
into character. ''When I return home I hope to persuade Mrs King to
place the award on the mantelpiece in the palace where it will be
enjoyed by the whole family.''
The jury did not leave the French film industry unrewarded. It gave
the Director Best Prize to The Hate directed by Mathieu Kassovitz a film
shown at the very end of the competition in an apparent eleventh hour
bid by the French industry to win something. It is about three young
Parisian teenagers who find themselves in trouble with the police during
a long and adventurous day which ends badly.
It is a funny, but very disturbing look at the problems of modern
youth. The Jury Prize was given to Don't Forget You're Going to Die,
directed by Xavier Beauvois, about a young man who discovers he is
HIV-positive.
It was a night of a thousand stars in Cannes with the Palm D'Or being
presented by the most glittering of them all, Sharon Stone, whose film,
The Quick and the Dead, brought the festival to a close.
* Ealing Studios, where many of Britain's classic comedy films were
made, could be saved from the receivers after #2m was put up for a
rescue bid by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts.
The foundation, which receives its money from the football pools, has
offered the money so the west London studios can be taken over by the
National Film and Television School.
The rescue operation was also understood to be benefiting from funds
from the national lottery.
In October last year the receivers were called in when the studios
collapsed with debts of more than #6m.

THE first woman to scale Mount Everest alone took time off from her
Highland training ground to talk about her plans to climb the world's
second highest mountain.
Mrs Alison Hargreaves, 32, who conquered the 29,028ft Everest without
Sherpa help or oxygen on May 13, after training on Ben Nevis, is now
preparing for an assault on the Himalayan summit of K2.
The ''ordinary'' mother of two spoke of her new target at the Aonach
Mor ski complex near Fort William at the weekend after her return home.
With children Kate, three, and Tom, six, at her side, she described
her feelings as she approached the roof of the world.
''Suddenly in front of me I saw the summit. The thing that's really
vivid in my memory is seeing the brightly coloured prayer flags against
the sky. I just felt this overwhelming surge of emotion and burst into
tears.''
She relayed a radio message to say that she had made it and spent
about 40 minutes on the summit. ''I was very conscious that the descent
was going to be far more dangerous,'' she said.
She was aware that she was starting to feel very tired, and on the way
down the mountain felt ''very, very sleepy'' and had to sit in the snow
at intervals to rest.
Asked for her reaction to claims that her place was at home with
husband Jim Ballard and the children, rather than climbing mountains,
she replied: ''I don't see that you can't be a good mother and also be
away. I just consider myself to be a normal mother who happens to be a
climber.''
Mrs Hargreaves will return to the Himalayas on June 11, after just a
fortnight's reunion with the family.
Does the prospect of tackling the 28,253ft K2, which is technically
more demanding than the Everest route, fill her with dread? ''I am
mainly a technical climber,'' she says. ''I would say, percentage-wise,
that I have a better chance than on Everest, but at the end of the day
it's down to the weather.''
Mr Ronnie Robb, who was part of the expedition she was with when she
made her failed attempt on Everest last autumn, is confident she will
succeed on K2. ''She has climbed much more difficult things on her own
and she's climbed something higher,'' he said.
Her father, John, added: ''If she hurts herself or gets killed, she
will have done that doing what she wants to do, but I am confident that
will not happen. We are a close family. If Alison knew we were worrying,
that would be additional stress for her. She knows we are all behind
her.''
After K2, Mrs Hargreaves has set herself another goal for next spring
-- a third Himalayan giant, Kangchenjunga.

THREE children watched yesterday as their father fell to his death
through a hole at the edge of a cliff in the Western Isles.
The man, believed to be a 40-year-old tourist, was trying to retrieve
one of his children's shoes near cliffs on North Uist.
The man's wife and their three children were with him at the time,
coastguards said.
A coastguard helicopter flew to the scene at Scolpaig, near Griminish
Point, but the man was found to be dead after the 60ft fall. Police at
Stornoway said the man would not be identified until relatives had been
informed.

AN 18-month-old boy has died barely 36 hours after being given a new
heart by transplant surgeons.
Miles Parker died on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of
Harefield Hospital, west London, yesterday as his parents sat by his
side.
Miles, from Crewe, Cheshire -- he was named by a hospital spokesman
after he died -- had been flown to Harefield by an RAF Wessex helicopter
from RAF Valley in north Wales on Friday night. The helicopter had
picked him up from Liverpool's Broadgreen Hospital as soon as a suitable
donor organ was found.
Hours after the operation, by Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, principal
surgeon at Harefield and the leading specialist in heart transplants for
children, the hospital said doctors were pleased with the boy's
progress. But earlier yesterday they described his condition as
''critical''.
It was understood that the boy's parents had accepted that there was a
real risk that the operation would not be a success, but wanted it to go
ahead because it was his only chance.
A hospital spokesman said: ''This was a child suffering from a very
complex congenital heart condition. Several parts of his heart were not
functioning correctly.
''He had had previous heart surgery, not at Harefield, and an
assessment was done in January. It was clear that the only possible
solution was a heart transplant because of the seriousness of the heart
condition.
''A suitable heart only became available on Friday.''
Professor Yacoub's team had carried out two other transplants in the
past 10 days -- on a seven-year-old girl and a four-year-old girl -- and
both were doing well, he said.

A RETIRED electricity worker claimed yesterday that he and his wife
and daughter were driven from their home by a ''family from hell''.
The former home of Mr Robert Anderson, 64, his wife Margaret, 56, and
daughter Caroline, 20, is below the flat occupied by mother-of-13 Mrs
Margaret Haney in Stirling's Raploch area.
It now lies empty and boarded up, after the Anderson family won a
battle to be rehoused by Stirling District Council.
The council agreed to the move last August after the Andersons'
curtains were set on fire by Mrs Haney's teenage grand-daughter Kim
Haney.
The girl, then 16, pled guilty on indictment at Stirling Sheriff Court
last October to endangering Mr and Mrs Anderson's lives and the lives of
other neighbours by starting the blaze by standing on a rubbish bin and
leaning through an open window with a cigarette lighter.
The fire spread to a mattress and filled the bedroom with smoke.
At the time, the Haney family solicitor, Mr Ian Angus, told the court
that there had been ''some kind of dispute'' between the Andersons and
the accused.
Visiting Sheriff Kenneth Muir gave the girl a deferred sentence after
hearing that Mrs Haney herself had taken her to Stirling police station
to confess.
Yesterday Mrs Haney blamed the fire-raising on the years her
grand-daughter spent in local authority care. ''These places leave the
kids disturbed, and we have to sort them out again,'' she said.
0 The Andersons spent nearly a year in the same tenement block as the
Haneys, whom Sheriff Norrie Stein said last Friday had inflicted misery
on the Raploch community.
It was Joseph, 20, who sparked Sheriff Stein's comments when he
appeared for sentence.
He was jailed for 60 days after being found guilty of being on a flat
roof behind Stirling's Golden Lion Hotel in April in circumstances where
it could be reasonably inferred he intended to commit theft.
Mrs Haney said she would meet Mr Angus later this week, and was
considering referring the sheriff's comments to the Lord Advocate.
She said: ''He's branded us another family from hell.''
Seven Haneys have made hundreds of court appearances.

AN island's magnificent neo-Gothic church, lashed by easterly gales
and seaspray, is in danger of being lost forever as a place of worship.
Pleas from the 159-strong Church of Scotland congregation at Lamlash
on Arran for help towards restoration of the ''miniature cathedral''
have so far fallen on deaf ears. Even the local council has turned down
a request for money.
But it is not just the church, built by the 12th Duke of Hamilton in
the 1880s, that is at risk. Villagers now confess that should the church
physically collapse, regular Sunday worship in the community could
disappear just as dramatically.
''People here keep to their own church. Members of our congregation
would not want to worship anywhere else on the island. It would seem
very strange,'' said one villager yesterday.
Captain John Davidson, clerk to the church board, agreed: ''It's the
only church in the village, but there's still a lot of rivalry on this
island. I can't imagine our congregation going to any other church. We
have to get the money from somewhere before it's too late.''
Their pride in Lamlash Church has made villagers all the more
determined to raise the #200,000 needed for repairs to the fabric,
particularly crumbling stonework and falling tiles. Water is seeping
through the red sandstone walls and eating into the plasterwork.
The fact that the church was given a Grade A listing last year cut no
ice with Cunninghame District Council, which agreed to make no
contribution despite the interior boasting a tripartite Gothic sedilia
at its west end.
What makes Lamlash Church so interesting to architectural students,
tourists, and antiquarians is that it was designed as a miniature
cathedral with its barrel-vaulted ceilings and massive campanile tower
housing a nine-bell carillon.
It was only last year, shortly after the listing, that locals noticed
serious erosion. Without outside help, they set out to raise the
renovation money themselves.
The usual sales and coffee mornings have raised #15,000. In
desperation, one pensioner agreed to a sponsored walk round the whole of
Arran, an 80-mile journey that took four days.
''It's getting desperate and it's getting difficult to keep the
impetus going,'' said Captain Davidson. ''No official body has come
forward to help us and some of the work needs immediate attention. Other
parts will have to be started within the next two years.
''Because it's a listed building we can't use artificial stone. It's
got to be original sandstone in keeping with the church's character.''
The board has pleaded with other organisations for help, including
Historic Scotland. It could take months before members receive an answer
and they fear the council's refusal to help might influence the
Government agency.

<HEADLINE>Row over pay award claim in battle for union control</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978157840</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FRESH row broke out last night in the battle for control of
Britain's second biggest union as a leaked memorandum suggested a pay
offer worth up to 11% was being made to top officials.
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union,
declined to be drawn on the figure. He is fighting a challenge for his
#44,000-a-year-post from a close ally of Labour leader Tony Blair, Mr
Jack Dromey.
Mr Dromey moved swiftly to pledge that he would take no pay increase
if elected as TGWU general secretary.
''Our officers and staff deserve the best, but so too do our
members,'' he said.
''Personally, I will take no increase as general secretary and I will
hand back Bill Morris's swish limousine and union credit card.''
According to a confidential TGWU memorandum leaked to GMTV's Sunday
programme, top union officers are set to receive a pay rise equivalent
to between 10-11%.
The memorandum shows that the pay of a top grade TGWU official could
rise from #28,000 to almost #31,000.
Asked whether he was offering top union officers 10-11%, Mr Morris
declined to deny the figure.
''The officers negotiate every year with the executive members and the
executive council, and we have to conclude an agreement before June 1,''
he said.
''We are in negotiations. I am not prepared to say precisely what we
will offer until such time as I report to my executive.''
He insisted that the issue was not about what the officers were paid.
''There's too many people worrying about what the officers are paid. I
want more of our officers worrying about what our members are paid,'' he
said.
Meanwhile, the election campaign became embroiled in accusation and
counter-accusation of rule breaches.
Mr Morris revealed that he had submitted complaints to the union's
administrative secretary, Mr Ray Collins, about the conduct of Mr
Dromey's campaign.
''I have had cause to complain, so I have registered my complaints and
concerns to the appropriate officer in our union. That's a matter for
that particular officer and the returning officer to deal with,'' Mr
Morris said.
There was ''no question'' of legal action.
Mr Dromey has accused Mr Morris's supporters of rule breaches by
alleging they have used union resources to fund the Morris campaign.
The Dromey camp alleges that TGWU officials, who are supposed to
remain neutral, are organising a #5000 mailshot at the union's expense
to distribute Mr Morris's campaign material to 20,000 members in the
South-west of England.
Both Mr Morris and Mr Dromey deny any malpractice.
The union's 950,000 members must vote for their leader by June 16. The
result will be announced a week later.
Mr Morris raised the temperature of the leadership battle when he said
his opponent would face a ''conflict of interest'' as TGWU leader
because Mr Dromey's wife, Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman,
could become Employment Secretary in a Blair-led government, with
responsibility for unions.
Mr Dromey told TGWU members in London yesterday that Mr Morris could
damage Labour and Mr Blair.
He said Mr Morris could cause conflict with Mr Blair so that Labour
had only one term in power.
''After 17 years of the Tory winter, the result would be a rejuvenated
Tory Party back in power, led by Michael Portillo. That prospect is
unthinkable,'' Mr Dromey said.

A WOMAN who lives on the top floor of a 22-storey block of flats is
demanding to be rehoused by Glasgow District Council after cracks in her
walls widened to a point where daylight could be seen through them.
Mrs Margaret Blake, 49, of Balbeggie Street in Sandyhills, Glasgow,
said yesterday that she had been afraid to remain in the flat since the
cracks widened a few weeks ago.
Glasgow District Council's building and works department recently
inspected the living-room walls in the flat and temporarily filled the
cracks.
The council, which claims the walls are not in a dangerous state, has
said they will be repaired as soon as possible.
However, Mrs Blake fears that the walls are unsafe and is demanding to
be permanently rehoused rather than decanted while the remedial work is
carried out.
She said yesterday: ''I can't sleep at night for worrying about the
cracks and have been taking panic attacks. I have lived here for eight
years and there have always been cracks in the walls but they have just
recently become protruded and I can't believe that they are not
dangerous.
''Sometimes I sit and watch for them moving when the building sways in
the wind and I can hear debris falling.''
Mrs Blake, who suffers from angina and arthritis in the spine and has
been unemployed for about 12 years, added that she was now too afraid to
live in any high-rise flat. She is demanding to be rehoused in the
Sandyhills area.
''I just have a fear that, no matter what kind of repairs they carry
out, it could happen again.''
Mr David Cromley, the district council's director of housing, stressed
after a local buildings and works manager visited Mrs Blake yesterday
that the flat walls were safe.
''Mrs Blake apparently reported rain penetration and the holes have
been produced by architects checking to see the extent of the remedial
work required.
''The walls are not dangerous. We certainly wouldn't be leaving Mrs
Blake there if there was any doubt about the safety of the building. But
we are going to have to rebuild the walls, which is why we are
suggesting that she should be decanted.

A MAN who left a newborn baby at a hospital might have been picked up
on security cameras, it was revealed yesterday.
Detectives are believed to be studying video tapes in their bid to
track down the man, who called himself Ian Young.
The baby boy, named Fraser by nurses, was left at Edinburgh's Eastern
General Hospital on Friday night about an hour after being born.
Mr Young said that the baby's mother, Michelle, had three other
children and could not cope.
Nurses kept Mr Young talking for 10 minutes before he walked out. He
was described as 25 to 30, 5ft 10in, slim, with short blond hair and
moustache. He spoke with an Edinburgh accent.
Yesterday, officials at the hospital confirmed that security cameras
were in use, but would not say whether they were likely to have caught
Mr Young as he delivered the baby in a holdall to the maternity unit.
Detective Inspector John MacFarlane said the cameras were one of
''various avenues'' being explored.
He added that the response from the public had been disappointing so
far, despite interviews with bus and taxi drivers in the area and people
who were at the hospital.
He said: ''This is not a criminal inquiry relating to the woman or the
man.
''We are anxious to track the woman down as she may be in the need of
urgent medical assistance and may be suffering from severe mental
trauma.
Dr David Farquarhson, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the
Eastern General, said the baby would be looked after in the hospital's
special care unit indefinitely.
He added that all midwives and maternity units in the area had been
contacted.
It is hoped that someone might know of a woman who was due to have a
baby but had not been checked on recently.

THE lure of the West Highlands' very own butterfly is set to have
scores of enthusiasts in a flutter this summer.
So prized is the butterfly that much of the work at Glasdrum National
Nature Reserve, on the shores of Loch Creran, Argyll, is devoted to
protecting the rare species.
The orange and black Chequered Skipper, which has just hatched out in
its forest strongholds of Argyll and Lochaber, also used to be found in
central and eastern England -- but is now extinct there. A pub in the
village of Ashton, Northamptonshire, still retains the name.
Enthusiasts from different parts of Britain are expected to embark on
an annual pilgrimage to Glasdrum to see the Chequered Skipper, according
to Mr Andrew Campbell, local officer for Scottish Natural Heritage.
The inch-long creature used to be found in Northamptonshire and
Lincolnshire until its habitat shrank, confining it to the West
Highlands.
The butterfly has been late in hatching out from its chrysallis stage
this year because May has been colder than usual.
However, a few days of warmer, wetter weather have brought it on to
the wing.
In north Argyll and Lochaber, the butterfly has fashioned its own
characteristics, including a fierce territorial nature which sees it
chasing off other species which come on to its patch.
Mr Campbell said: ''It's a real survivor. It's a real Scottish
speciality -- appearing in May when it can almost be snowing, feeding on
very tough grass, and surviving in perhaps some of the wettest parts of
Britain.''
Research is currently being carried out in England to see if the
butterfly can be successfully reintroduced.

A SCOTTISH parliament should open up the debate on local government
finance, the Labour leader of the new Edinburgh City Council has urged.
Councillor Keith Geddes told a weekend conference that under a
Scottish parliament new forms of tax could be introduced -- other than
the property-value based council tax.
He said a Scottish parliament would have to examine its relationship
to local councils, and could consider new ways to spread the burden of
local taxation.
Among his suggestions for new taxes was a tourism tax -- applied on
hotel room occupancy.
A sales tax or examining the possibility of bringing in road tolls had
also been advanced, Mr Geddes said.
He told the conference at New Parliament House -- the former Royal
High School building in Edinburgh -- that instead of receiving
Government grant just to cover one year, councils should be given a
clear indication about their grant levels over a three-year period.
He also called for a relaxation, or preferably an end, to the
Secretary of State's powers to cap local authority budgets.
He said: ''The Secretary of State must no longer set himself up as de
facto chair of every council's finance committee.
''Let him have faith in the local electorate and in doing so he would
help revive local democracy.''
Mr Geddes, the current leader of Lothian region, said the local
elections had shown that redrawing lines on maps would not save the
fortunes of the Tories, who failed to win control in any of the 29 new
unitary councils. He claimed the Tories had failed to realise that the
electorate wanted strong, effective, local government.
He declared that voters wanted a local government system capable of
responding to local needs and aspirations and a system with the
necessary powers and responsibilities to allow councils to deliver.
But he warned that the new councils had to demonstrate their relevance
and their commitment to meeting local needs, and had to secure community
support.

LABOUR'S transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, yesterday warned that
Labour would launch a campaign if British Rail directors were found to
have been paid excessive bonuses for their services to privatisation.
His warning followed the disclosure at the weekend that BR's recently
retired chairman, Sir Bob Reid, had been given a #75,000 performance
bonus during his last year as chairman.
Sir Bob's salary increase from a basic #131,000 to #206,000, was
compared by unions to the 3% offered to railworkers, who are threatening
to strike over pay negotiations with BR.
''When the annual report of the company is published soon we will
probably find that other members of the board have also been given
significant sums of money,'' said Mr McLeish.
''I am concerned this may be the tip of the iceberg. If the Government
can spend #1250m on privatisation, then special performance perks may
have been made to other board members. We are demanding to know if this
is the case. We will be focusing on this in the next weeks and months --
it is a question of fairness.
''The British people are sick and tired of double standards operating
in industries at this time.
''We have up till now been focusing on excessive perks and pay in the
private utilities. I will now be launching a major campaign on what is
happening in relation to payments in BR,'' said Mr McLeish.
He also brushed aside a challenge by the Liberal Democrats that Labour
back their proposal to buy back 51% of a privatised Railtrack.
''The privatisation of the railways is a complete shambles and there
is no expectation that Railtrack will be sold. The important thing is
that rather than thinking ahead in detail as the Liberal Democrats have
been doing, we should ensure that the sale does not take place,'' said
Mr McLeish.
''It is very unlikely that much of BR will be in the private sector --
interest in Railtrack is at an all-time low. That is the reason for the
Government's wheeling out Scottish Nuclear for privatisation. It is not
productive to detail some pie in the sky economics about buying it
back.''
Speaking on BBC Scotland's Scottish Lobby programme yesterday, the
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, claimed a
commitment by the Liberal Democrats and Labour to buying back 51% of
Railtrack at par or market price would stop privatisation in its tracks.

THREE children watched yesterday as their father fell to his death
through a hole at the edge of a cliff in the Western Isles.
The man, believed to be a 40-year-old tourist, was trying to retrieve
one of his children's shoes near cliffs on North Uist.
But he slipped and fell through the hole, exposed by wind and weather,
in the cliff edge. The man's wife and their three children were with him
at the time, coastguards said.
A coastguard helicopter flew to the scene at Scolpaig, near Griminish
Point, but the man was found to be dead after the 60ft fall.
Police at Stornoway said last night that the man would not be
identified until relatives had been informed.

THOUSANDS of people were feared killed on the Russian island of
Sakhalin in a huge earthquake.
It was also believed it could trigger an ecological disaster: the
tremors had ruptured an oil pipeline in more than 15 places and
destroyed all the oil wells in the area.
Early this morning there had been 300 deaths officially confirmed, and
another 300 injured.
However, Russian news agencies said most residents in Neftegorsk, an
oil-producing town of 3200 people on the remote Far Eastern Sakhalin
Island, had been buried and trapped in the rubble of their homes after
the quake struck in the middle of the night.
Authorities said it could be the worst to hit the country.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, destroyed
about 20 five-storey apartment blocks. Interfax news agency said
rescuers could hear groans coming from most of the wrecked buildings.
''I think this is the worst earthquake ever in Russia,'' said First
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. ''It is a calamity. Judging by the
nature of the destruction and the potential number of victims it looks
like the most terrible.''
Mr Nikolai Borisenko, head of the Sakhalin oil and gas company, said a
60-mile stretch of pipeline from Okha to Neftegorsk had been ruptured in
more than 15 places. The pipeline has been shut down.
''Eye-witnesses say they can hear the voices and moaning of people
buried alive under the rubble,'' said Tass. Rescuers struggling to free
victims had to combat fog and freezing.
Tass quoted the ministry for emergency situations as saying special
rescue teams had been flown to the island. The health ministry said it
had sent in seven tonnes of medicines and a mobile hospital.
The independent Russian television channel NTV said the relief effort
was hampered by the bad condition of local roads and a lack of nearby
airports capable of taking large cargo planes carrying vital medicines
and other aid.
''No one expected such a powerful earthquake would ever strike
Sakhalin,'' Tass reporter Yevgeny Belovitsky told NTV in a telephone
interview.
Sakhalin is 4500 miles east of Moscow. A team of Russian Ministers has
flown from the capital to oversee rescue operations.
The earthquake was the third big tremor in the region in less than a
year. In January, Russian officials predicted a big quake would strike
the region this year.
More than 5000 people were killed in Japan's port city of Kobe in
January. A tremor rocked a thinly populated part of the Kurile Islands
off the northern tip of Japan in October, killing at least 11 people and
devastating two of the islands.
* In 1983, two Russian fighter planes from a military base on Sakhalin
Island shot down a Korean Airline Boeing 747, killing 269 people on
board. The plane had veered badly off course over the island, and the
Russians apparently mistook it for another Boeing on a spying mission.

THE Government's refusal to publish a consultants' report which
advised against the privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne is not
supported by the companies whose commercial interests it claims to be
protecting, The Herald has discovered.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish said last night it had become
''a major issue of open government'' which he would be pursuing in
Parliament.
The Herald revealed last week that the Government was determined to
prevent the publication of the report, by international accountants
KPMG, which had cost the public purse #137,500. This had examined CalMac
and the operation of ferries in Orkney and Shetland.
Opposition MPs and island councillors have demanded its publication
and believe it is being ''supressed'' for political reasons because it
highlights the success of CalMac, a publicly owned company.
They argue that the refusal to publish is contrary to guidelines on
open government laid down by the Prime Minister in November, not least
the section which deals with consultants' reports and research studies.
Any particularly sensitive material, they argue, could be removed if
necessary.
The Scottish Office, however, remains unmoved, insisting: ''The
material was made available to the consultants by other shipping
operators and by CalMac on the strict understanding that it would not be
made public.''
The Herald, however, has found considerable enthusiasm among some
operators for publication. Mr Andrew Wilson, a director of Western
Ferries which competes with CalMac on the Gourock/Dunoon route and also
plies between Islay and Jura, said yesterday: ''We certainly don't see
any reason why the report can't be published or that there is anything
really commercially sensitive.''
Mr David Laidlow, managing director of Orcargo, which runs between
Invergordon and Kirkwall, agreed: ''We would be delighted if the KPMG
report was published. We have no objections to the information we gave
being known by the public.''
Mr Jim Monkman, manager of the Orkney Line, part of Streamline which
provides a container service for the Northern Isles, said: ''We have
nothing to hide. We want it published.''
Mr Colin Paterson, managing director of CalMac, said the report had
been submitted to the Scottish Office and so it was up to it to decide,
and the publicly owned CalMac had to abide by that. ''In principle,
however, I would say that it should be published.''
P&amp;O might have been expected to oppose publication, given that it is a
private company currently in receipt of #7.6m in subsidies for its
services to Orkney and Shetland and is often compared unfavourably with
CalMac. But commercial director Scott Colgate said P&amp;O would not oppose
a summary or a sanitised version of the report being published.
''We opened up our books to the consultants and so we wouldn't want
all our figures made public, but if these were taken out then there
shouldn't be a problem if it was a balanced report,'' he said.
Mr McLeish claimed the Government had been hiding behind the
camouflage of commercial confidentiality to obscure what was a very
positive report on CalMac and therefore politically embarrassing to a
Government committed to privatisation. It could not do that any longer
given the companies' attitude. As important as this was, there was a
bigger issue, he said.
''This Government does not practise any real disclosure into the
public arena and it is absolutely absurd in Scotland that politicians,
the public, and the press cannot get the truth on any particular issue
in which the Government is involved,'' he said.
''Why, after 16 years in power, is the Government acting so
secretively? That is the issue.''

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns could quit the club this week unless he
receives guarantees from chief executive Fergus McCann.
The manager wants assurances that he will be free to run the football
side of the business without interference.
I understand Burns, whose management brought the club its first trophy
in six years on Saturday, has been close to resigning on several
occasions this season because of difficulties in working with Mr McCann.
I understand the relationship is now at breaking point.
The week after the Scottish Cup final victory will see Burns and
McCann in talks which could lead to the manager leaving Celtic.
Burns hinted at the differences when he was asked about his working
relationship with Mr McCann.
He said briefly: ''The only way this can be resolved is by talking and
listening to each other's viewpoint.''
However, the problem has become so severe that Burns has no dialogue
with Mr McCann and simply receives memos from the chief executive. On
Saturday they posed outside Hampden with the cup, but that image hides
the serious divisions inside the club.
Burns wants to have exclusive control over transfer and contract
negotiations. Recent incidents have also not helped the situation.
When the club went to Milan to prepare for the cup final the players
were given no spending money -- a break with established practice at the
club.
Celtic also had not hired a training ground and the players had to
train in the hotel grounds.
There was also a serious disagreement between Mr McCann and his
manager over the evidence which was presented to the independent
tribunal set up by the SFA to set a compensation sum for Kilmarnock
following the poaching of Burns by Mr McCann from the Ayrshire club last
summer.
Burns has told close friends that he will leave rather than face
another season of behind-the-scenes problems which have often left him
and his closest allies at Parkhead frustrated and embittered.
Leicester City manager Mark McGhee has already said outside
intervention -- away from manager-to-manager talks -- almost ended the
transfer of Mike Galloway from Celtic.
Since then delays have hampered negotiations with the foreign players
Burns wants. Mr McCann maintained after the final that he supported
Burns. He insisted: ''Tommy Burns has a strong personality and so have
I. Obviously we occasionally have our differences but we don't have a
major disagreement because we have the same objectives.
''He has my backing to get the job done in terms of providing
resources for things such as contracts with players and transfer deals
and raising capital. This is a big club and it has been a difficult
year.''
Unless Mr McCann is ready to talk to Burns he may find the coming year
even more difficult.

RANGERS' manager Walter Smith has complained to his local council that
his privacy is being invaded by a neighbour's conservatory.
His complaint comes six months after his near-neighbour, the Ibrox
star Brian Laudrup, described Helensburgh as the most ''tranquil'' and
''private'' place to live.
Mr Smith and his next-door neighbour, Mr Hugh McColl, claim that their
back gardens were flooded when builders added the contentious
conservatory -- which overlooks their gardens -- to a new house owned by
Mrs Jessie Colquhoun.
Mrs Colquhoun admits that she had the conservatory built at her
#160,000 home without planning permission from Dumbarton District
Council. She has now asked the council to grant permission
retrospectively.
She said: ''I haven't fallen out with anyone. I just have to get
everything here legal.''
While cynics suggest that Mr Smith might have been happier with a blue
house than a greenhouse, other residents of a nearby street, where Brian
Laudrup and Mark Hateley have also set up homes, have joined the battle
with the council planners.
Planning director Ian Fernie has told councillors not to rubber-stamp
Mrs Colquhoun's application -- ''because of the persistence of objection
to the development on this site and the range of sensitive issues
involved''.
The council's planning committee will decide whether to accept his
suggestion tomorrow. Meanwhile, it has been given a report which states
that the Smiths and McColls claim the conservatory is more of an
extension than a conservatory. They are concerned that a number of the
windows and a patio door on the conservatory look into the back of their
houses.
Mr Fernie says that, throughout the building of Mrs Colquhoun's home,
the council has had complaints from residents in this exclusive part of
upper Helensburgh.
The planning director says that he personally has no gripe about the
conservatory, which is similar to others built at houses in the area. He
adds: ''I would not be inclined to recommend that permission be refused
for reasons of unacceptable loss of privacy.''
Mr Fernie has suggested that members of the planning committee should
visit the site.
Six months ago Brian Laudrup, Scottish player of the year, boasted of
the tranquillity and privacy of living in Helensburgh. The calming
effects of the town, with its views of the Clyde, gave him a lifestyle
he said he had not found anywhere else in Europe.
At the time the Danish international said: ''At Ibrox, I have managed
to become a football player for half the week and a normal human being
the rest of the time.
''My wife, Mette, says that for the first time in years, after our
moves around Germany and Italy, she's found somewhere she wants to stay
-- in Italy all we spoke about was getting away.''

Ambulance crews and the Fire Brigade raced to the scene after reports
of people trapped in a blazing vehicle.
The accident happened at Westmount Road, Eltham, south London, just
after 11pm.
''The car caught fire on impact with a tree by the roadside,'' a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
Officers were trying to find out why the car left the road. It is not
thought any other car was involved, said the Yard.
All the victims were certified dead at the scene by a police surgeon.
Twenty firefighters attended the accident. The fire was extinguished
but the cars' occupants could not be rescued.

THE Prime Minister last night threw down the gauntlet to the Bosnian
Serbs by ordering in 6000 troops after 33 British soldiers were seized
at gunpoint.
Parliament is also to be recalled on Wednesday from its Whitsun
recess.
After an emergency session at Downing Street of top Cabinet Ministers
and defence chiefs, Mr Major said Britain would send two artillery
batteries and an armoured engineer squadron to the war zone, with the 24
Air Mobile Brigade, a highly flexible unit, under orders to prepare to
deploy. It has anti-tank missile systems which could be used against
Serb heavy guns.
Britain already has 3380 peacekeeping troops in the country.
The British soldiers captured by the Serbs at Gorazde joined hundreds
of other UN troops, mostly French, already being held hostage, some as
''human shields'' to prevent further Nato air strikes. The UK troops
were serving with the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers.
The immediate use of SAS units for a swift rescue raid is believed to
have been ruled out because of the danger to these other hostage troops.
The Serb defiance of world opinion increased yesterday when they
killed the Bosnian Government's Foreign Minister by shooting down his
helicopter.
General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serbs, warned the UN he could
not ensure the captured Britons' safety unless four Serb soldiers held
after a firefight with French peacekeepers in Sarajevo were released.
Mr Major was firm in his reply. He in turn warned General Mladic:
''The consequences will be very severe if these (British) soldiers are
not released unharmed.''
In the attack in which the British soldiers were captured, two groups
escaped under fire, with one squad crashing its Saxon armoured vehicle
through a Serb checkpoint as guns blazed all around.
Details of the showdown came from Lieutenant-Colonel John Riley, the
UN commander in Gorazde.
''Colonel Riley told us that three observation posts on the west bank
of the Drina river were overpowered very quickly and the men only had
time to alert the other posts over the radio,'' said UN spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward in Sarajevo.
Five other British observation posts came under assault shortly
afterwards. Colonel Coward said three managed to escape, two of them
under Serb fire. ''One of the observation posts in a Saxon armoured
vehicle crashed through a Bosnian Serb army checkpoint barrier under
heavy fire and made good its escape.''
There were no reports of any casualties, and Colonel Riley said the
captured men had so far been treated acceptably.
The British soldiers had virtually no defence, UN spokesman Alexander
Ivanko said. ''The peacekeepers had only light arms and were located
very close to Serb positions,'' he said. ''The Serbs showed up on Sunday
as they've showed up many times before only this time with hostile
intent and stuck a gun in their face.''
A further 300 UK troops are now under siege in Gorazde itself, 30
miles south-east of Sarajevo.
The continuing wave of Serb aggression follows frantic diplomatic
moves to defuse the confrontation triggered by Nato air raids last week.
More than 280 UN personnel are now held captive, including 17 chained to
posts as human shields against further bombing strikes.
Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic died when his helicopter was downed
by a Serb missile as it flew over the Bihac enclave in north-western
Bosnia. The ground fire came from an area held by Serbs from both Bosnia
and Croatia. The Serbs said the helicopter was violating their
''airspace'' and refused to identify itself. Seven people were killed in
the attack: Ljubijankic, 47; deputy Justice Minister Izet Muhamedagic,
57; and five others.
The new crisis broke only hours before the emergency meeting of senior
Cabinet colleagues, including Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and the
chief of the defence staff, Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, called to
discuss Britain's response to the worsening situation.
The French, with more than 7000 men under UN command, have already
sent the aircraft carrier Foch and two escorting warships into the
Adriatic. Two of their soldiers were killed in a firefight with the
Serbs on Friday.
The Royal Navy carrier Illustrious is also heading for the area to
back up warships from both Nato and the Western European Union. The USS
Theodore Roosevelt with almost 100 strike aircraft is standing by to
provide air support.
UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said UN forces in Bosnia were ready to
confront the Serbs if political policy-makers accepted that they would
suffer casualties.
Mr Ivanko said the use of force against the Serbs appeared inevitable.
More than 200 heavy weapons have been seized by the Serbs from
UN-controlled depots in the last week. Use of some of this artillery to
shell Tuzla, another supposedly ''safe'' area, prompted the Nato air
strikes. More than 70 civilians have been killed by Serb fire.
EU Ministers and officials of the five-nation Contact Group -- the US,
Russia, France, Germany and Britain -- are due to meet today, and Nato
Foreign Ministers tomorrow to try to find a peaceful solution to
Europe's backyard war. Their priority must be the safe return of the
hostages, and the continued safety of the other 22,000 UN peacekeepers.
Contingency plans for a humiliating and potentially costly withdrawal
of all UN forces have been ready for several months. This would involve
the commitment of more than 50,000 Nato troops and hundreds of
helicopters to lift the peacekeepers to safety under cover of an allied
air armada.
It would also mark the effective end of any international brake on the
ethnic conflict within Bosnia. About 200,000 people have already died.
Worse, Western politicians fear that the conflict might spread to
engulf the rest of the Balkans. Greece, Turkey, Serbia itself and
possibly Russia might be drawn into a major conflict in the region.
Russia has traditionally been the Serbs' main supporter. But last
night, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and Defence Minister
Pavel Grachev were en route for Bosnia in an attempt to broker a
ceasefire. Moscow has asked that Nato suspend further air strikes until
the outcome of that mission becomes clear.

TERMINALLY ill people should be given the chance to act as guinea pigs
for untested drugs, a right-wing group claims today.
A study, published by the Social Affairs Unit, says doctors should be
allowed to prescribe unlicensed medicines with patient consent. It says
drugs can take up to 12 years to get on the market because of current
controls.
The author, Dr Mark Neal, of Reading University, claims stringent
testing regulations -- set out in the 1968 Medicines Act prompted by the
Thalidomide tragedy -- are costing lives.
Companies are required to carry out extensive trials on animals and on
humans before drugs are given a licence.
But Dr Neal claims trials on animals are a waste of time, adding:
''The earlier drugs can be tested on humans, the earlier they can be
assessed and brought on the market.''
Only one person has died in a drug trial in the last 20 years. Dr Neal
estimates a one-year delay in the marketing of all drugs brought out
between 1940 and 1969 would have resulted in the death of an extra
10,000 children.
The report says life-saving drugs such as penicillin, aspirin, and
paracetamol would all have had licence applications rejected under
current regulations.

<HEADLINE>Bank puts up money for care of elderly</HEADLINE>

AN initiative was launched yesterday to tackle the ''scandal'' of
elderly people forced to sell their house to pay for residential care.
Under the scheme the Co-operative Bank is to provide #10m in loans to
finance non profit-making day centres and care homes.
Announcing details at the Co-operative Movement annual congress in
Edinburgh's Usher Hall, its president, Mr Alf Morris, MP, said the
decline of state support in this area was a matter of deep and
increasing concern.
''In many areas local authority provision is close to being declared
dead as the Government seeks abolition of all remaining direct
residential provision by local authorities,'' he said.
''Its policies offer only an inexorable march toward total
privatisation in cyncial disregard of the wishes of elderly people whose
care is bartered on the open market.
''Making profits out of suffering and misery among the elderly and
vulnerable at the expense of taxpayers and of raiding the lifetime
savings of the weakest in society is not caring, it is cashing in. Never
was a privatisation so morally perverse.''
Mr Morris said the legacy of Government policy had been the closure of
residential homes and other institutions.
''Financial responsibility has been hived off by Whitehall to local
authorities which simply do not have anything like all the money they
need to fund a caring policy worthy of the name,'' he said.
Applications will now be invited from voluntary groups and ventures
run on co-operative lines for the #10m scheme, the bank's response to
approaches from Mr Morris.
He said he hoped it would be extended into a broader caring initiative
under the auspices of the Co-operative movement.
The way ahead was to develop high standards at affordable prices that
would cost individuals and taxpayers less than the ''exorbitant'' sums
charged by many private nursing homes.
''The need now is crystal clear for a third kind of care, one between
the private-for-profit sector and a rapidly declining public sector, a
new co-operative initiative that can restore to first-class condition
existing homes and build, equip, and run new facilities,'' Mr Morris,
the Labour and Co-operative member for Manchester Wythenshawe, said.
He cited an example in Darlington where following the failure of a
private company, a co-operative had been established to look after a
group of dependent people who previously relied on the county council.

A SENIOR RUC officer yesterday described as ''scandalous'' Belfast
disturbances in which 17 policemen were injured, a petrol station set on
fire, and a shot fired at a police patrol.
Assistant Chief Constable Bill Stewart said the ''most sinister
aspect'' of the trouble was the reappearance of guns on the province's
streets.
A single shot was fired by a suspected loyalist gunman at an RUC
patrol which had been called in to quell disturbances in the Shankill
Road area early yesterday.
It was the first time RUC officers had been fired on since October,
the start of the loyalist ceasefire.
No-one was hit and no fire was returned. However the gunman was
identified before he fled on foot.
Mr Stewart said: ''The man adopted a kneeling position, aimed a
handgun at the police, and appeared to fire at least one shot.'' Mr
Stewart also commended the restraint shown by the officers.
He warned: ''This society, and by that I mean the entire society, has
a clear choice. Support the legitimate forces of law and order or risk
abandoning the respective communities to mob rule.''
The shooting followed rioting at a petrol station on the Shankill Road
just after 2am.
Five police officers were detained in hospital yesterday after
tackling the filling station blaze, started by a mob.
The officers were treated for smoke inhalation and head, face, and
body injuries caused by a hail of bottles, bricks, and stones.
The petrol station was set alight as police moved in to check on a
stolen vehicle.
Meanwhile, five men were badly injured in a wave of punishment
beatings in Belfast over the weekend, days after US President Bill
Clinton called for the attacks to end at an investment summit in
Washington .
Yesterday a gang wielding baseball bats attacked a 19-year-old youth
and two men outside a taxi company in Beersbridge Road, east Belfast.
All three suffered head and face injuries and the teenager was
detained in hospital.
Earlier, a 46-year-old taxi driver was beaten up by two passengers he
had collected in Cromac Street, Belfast.
A 30-year-old man also suffered a broken arm after a gang armed with
baseball bats beat him up on Saturday in the Ligoniel Road area of
Belfast.
