THE bookmakers have made the Prime Minister odds-on favourite. Mr
Major is put at 1/5 with Michael Heseltine, trailing at 6/1, according
to Ladbrokes. It also shows Michael Portillo at 10/1, Norman Lamont and
Stephen Dorrell at 66/1, and Lady Thatcher at 100/1.
William Hill offers Mr Major at 4/6, but is rating the Tories' chances
of winning the next General Election at just 11/4, the longest odds
since they came to power.

IT is premature to assume that John Major's courage in resigning the
party leadership, only to recontest it and try and impose some order on
his party, will automatically lead to an overwhelming endorsement at the
election to come.
There is much more at stake than the Prime Minister's self-respect.
Large numbers of the MPs about to vote are reflecting on a yawning Tory
deficit in the opinion polls and contemplating the premature end of
their own political careers.
They are now faced with a stark choice. To endorse John Major's
leadership now is to say: this is the man who can best win the coming
election for the party.
All the accumulating evidence of recent weeks has been that large
numbers of Tory MPs, not just the Euro-sceptic rebels, do not, in their
heart of hearts, believe that he is.
Will they meekly slip into line? Or will they seize their last chance
to make that change?
Apart from the question of who can best beat Tony Blair's new-model
Labour Party, the deep policy fault lines now running through the Tory
Party, particularly those on Britain's future in Europe, raise further
questions about Mr Major's tactics.
The growing Eurosceptical tendency on the Government benches believes
itself to be far more in tune with the mood of the British people than
Mr Major, let alone such Europhiles as Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke.
It also sees an opportunity, in next year's inter-governmental
conference where the pressures for further European integration will be
intense, to engineer an opportunity for a vote-winning appeal to the
British people.
If British sovereignty faces even more erosion as these talks roll on,
the Portillo tendency clearly thinks that will be the ideal time to seek
a fresh popular mandate, to get tough on Brussels and, in the process,
scupper new Labour.
Were the Prime Minister to be allowed a sweeping victory in this
leadership election, either because no-one stands against him, or
because whichever stalking horse emerges is a third-rate cipher, the
anti-European cause and that opportunity to turn it to the Tory Party's
advantage at the polls, would be blown.
So there will be strong incentives for many Tory MPs to contemplate
both a credible challenge to Mr Major and, in the vote, an outcome that
will trigger a real challenge from a credible rival.
If the challenger is a stalking horse, there is the option of mass
abstention, to so undermine Mr Major's position that he has no choice
but to go.

Derek Douglas looks forward to rugby's big head-to-head.
TICKETS are already changing hands for #5000 on the black market. The
Ellis Park, Johannesburg, showdown between New Zealand and South Africa
is being billed as the greatest show on grass.
And the spine-tingling confrontation between All Black superman Jonah
Lomu and the Springbok Mr Nasty, James Small, has all the makings of a
rugby rumble in the concrete jungle.
Short of a sizeable chunk of Kryptonite in the pocket of his shorts --
or, failing that, a sledgehammer -- there would seem to be little reason
to suppose that Small will fare any better than any of the other
hopefuls who have confronted Lomu and, within minutes, found that their
worst nightmares have become supercharged, bulldozing, wide-awake
reality.
How to stop Lomu has become a national pastime over here on the high
veld. They have all tried and they have all failed. Ever since he
emerged like Terminator III against Ireland away back at the end of May,
every team that he has come up against has tried to devise a strategy
which would prevent him getting into his pulverising stride. All have
failed.
''Stop Lomu'' became a subject for debate in the South African
parliament. Under the headline 'How do we stop Lomu?' the Johannesburg
Star newspaper led the front page. Forget Bosnia, forget mystic Japanese
cults, forget hi-jackings. Forget everything. Stopping Lomu is top of
the news agenda in South Africa right now.
Did they provide an answer? No, after 800 words they didn't. The
closest the Star got to solving the Lomu problem was to quote
ex-Springbok winger Ray Mordt as saying: ''Pull him down with you in the
tackle, much as a lioness drags down a much heavier quarry.''
Advice like that James Small doesn't need.
However, there is no doubt about one thing. If there is one winger in
the world who has the mental approach necessary to halt Lomu in his
tracks, then it has to be Small.
The Lomu-Small confrontation at Ellis Park tomorrow represents rugby
in the raw. It might not be the kind of confrontation that the purists
appreciate or, indeed, condone but the rumble in the concrete jungle has
guaranteed a sell-out at Ellis Park and a world-wide TV audience of
millions.
Best watch from behind the settee, Ethel!
JAMES SMALL, SOUTH AFRICA
Position: Right wing.
Club: Wits.
Province: Natal.
Height: 6ft.
Weight: 13st 3lb.
Occupation: Representa tive, part-time model.
Born: Cape Town, 10-2-69.
Pedigree: Son of former Springbok soccer player Vernon Small.
Case file: Enfant terrible of South African rugby. A hard man with a
big mouth, he was sent off by English referee Ed Morrison (who is in
charge at Ellis Park tomorrow) for foul-mouthed dissent during South
Africa's second Test defeat by Australia last August.
Small was fortunate to remain on the park in the first Test against
England last summer when, once again, he was unable to control his fiery
temperament.
During the Springbok tour of New Zealand, Small was cited for
dangerous play after a late, high tackle on the Waikato lock, Steve
Gordon.
The Bad-Boy tag remained with him on his return to South Africa last
autumn when he was involved in an ''incident'' in a Durban night-club
and omitted from the Springbok party which toured Scotland and Wales
last year.
In measuring up to Lomu, the question is whether Small has the
physical attributes to go with his kamikaze approach.
He is, nevertheless, a national hero in South Africa, where he has
inspired a huge following among young Springbok wannabes, and in spite
of his problems with indiscipline he is also a prolific try-scorer, as
demonstrated by his seven touchdowns from six Tests in 1993.
Quote: ''Coach Kitch Christie has got a hard job and he doesn't need a
little shit like me causing trouble. I need somebody to kick me up the
backside and his decision to drop me from the Scotland and Wales tour
came at the best time.''
JONAH LOMU, NEW ZEALAND
Position: Left wing.
Club: Weymouth.
Province: Counties.
Height: 6ft 5in.
Weight: 20st.
Occupation: Bank clerk.
Born: Auckland, 12-5-75.
Pedigree: First All Black of Tongan descent. Father Semisi played
Tongan representative rugby as prop and hooker in 1969.
Case file: Devout Christian who paints a crucifix on each boot before
matches. In four weeks, has become the best known rugby player on this
planet -- and probably all the others as well.
When he made his Test debut against France last year he was, at 19
years and 45 days, the youngest All Black ever. His rawness was exposed
by the French and he was dropped, but came into the RWC squad as a late
choice.
Variously known as the Tongan Express, the Auckland Monster, a freak
(Will Carling) and a phenomenon (Jack Rowell), Lomu has struck terror
into the hearts of opposing wingers. After his four-try spree against
England, Tony Underwood was officially ''rested'' in order to let the
psychological and physical scars heal.
All Black manager Colin Meads declared that he had seen many players
with Lomu's physique but never on the wing.
Before the tournament even got under way Lomu was being targeted by
Rugby League and American football. His response is equivocal and very
much along the lines that he is in South Africa to play rugby for the
All Blacks. Once this weekend is over, his telephone will start ringing.
Quote: ''Lomu prefers to do his talking on the pitch. He has been
shielded from the media glare by Kiwi minder Ric Salizzo since touchdown
at Jo'burg Airport. The media beast was forced to gorge upon a
video-taped interview with Jonah during which the most memorable
utterance was: ''I like fruit, feijuas mostly.''
Least likely to say: ''After you, Mr Underwood.''

GRAEME Obree raced to his second record of the Isle of Man week in
Ramsay yesterday. The former world pursuit champion broke Darryl
Webster's 10-year-old course-and-event record by 45 seconds, winning the
open 10-mile TT in 20min.06sec.
The Scot, who set a 25-miles record two days earlier, came home with a
73 seconds winning margin, with Olympic team pursuit rider Paul Jennings
second.
''There was a bit of a head wind on the outward leg,'' said Obree,
''and I found the roads very rough, so I'm quite happy with that time.''

IT was in October, 1968, that Bob Beamon leapt almost out of the
sandpit to set the most durable athletics world record.
But a month before Beamon's Mexico Olympics feat a Scot, David Walker,
set a Scottish record, also in the long jump. And while Beamon's 8.90
metres was eclipsed by Mike Powell with 8.95m in 1991, Walker's 7.67m
remains, the oldest Scottish record in the books.
So it is unfortunate that two athletes capable of challenging that
mark today are denied the chance of a realistic assault. For the long
jump is scheduled for the opening session (6pm) of the Scottish
championships at Meadowbank, when common sense dictates that tomorrow
afternoon might have yielded more propitious conditions.
That will not prevent 20-year-old Darren Ritchie (7.46m this season,
and seventh best Scot all-time) and decathlete Duncan Mathieson (7.05m)
from trying, but they are entitled to feel aggrieved at the schedule.
Mathieson, 26, and twice a former winner, reached 7.60m last season and
is second on the all-time list.
Doug Walker will warm up to test a hamstring injury before deciding
whether to defend the 200m title.
* YVONNE Murray may be out of action for as much as three weeks with
the knee injury which ruled her out of this weekend's Europa Cup.
Physiotherapist David McLean, the SRU fitness advisor who treats the
Commonwealth 10,000m champion, has ordered no training for three days in
order to clear sciatic pain behind a knee. ''But she could be out for
three weeks,'' said coach Tom Boyle yesterday.
However the injury responds, Murray is unlikely to face Sonia
O'Sullivan at Gateshead, over 1500m, a fortnight today. Boyle considers
it ''probably too fast for a first outing.''
Fred Salle (long jump) and Phyllis Smith (relay) were the latest cup
casualties yesterday.

Ross Finlay finds Toyota's engine room running smoothly.
WHEN people ask what kind of car they should be thinking about, if
they want a roomy bodyshell and substantial luggage capacity, combined
with top-class economy but without going as far as a diesel, I usually
suggest they include the Toyota Carina E on their list of possibilities.
This is a car which magazine testers often claim bores them out of their
skull, but the latest 1.8-litre lean burn engine, as in the CDX version
I have been driving, gives it the performance boost this remarkably
economical saloon or hatchback needed when it was available only as a
1.6.
Engine factories are hardly as glamorous as those which turn out
complete cars, but the Toyota plant at Deeside in North Wales is an
eye-opener. Business is going like a bomb. It built its 100,000th engine
after just 27 months, contributes to the strong sales of UK-produced
Carinas abroad, exports 3000 sets of blocks and crankshafts to Japan
every month, and is devoted entirely to lean burn production.
The 1.8-litre CDX comes near the top of the Carina price range,
without having the lavish trim and equipment levels of the Executive or
the tearaway performance of the GTi. It costs #15,820 as a four-door
saloon or #15,970 as the five-door hatchback I tried.
Toyota has given this car excellent passenger accommodation. There is
plenty of rear seat space, with a sensible amount of room for passengers
there to ease their feet under the front seats. Not many cars in this
class manage to combine all that with a generous boot capacity, but the
Carina has that too.
Standard equipment includes anti-lock brakes, heated windscreen and
door mirrors, more supportive front seats than lesser models in the
range, a six-speaker sound system which will take CDs, pleasant tweed
upholstery, and a certain amount of walnut trim. A rear spoiler and a
leather-bound steering wheel add a mild sporty touch, but this is no
kind of sports saloon.
The first time I tried a 1.8 there was a competitive economy run as
part of the proceedings. Some freak driving inevitably resulted. With
the CDX I was going about my lawful occasions on local roads, but I
still felt the urge from time to time to indulge in some ultra-economy
driving.
This involves things like changing down as little as possible, never
letting the lean burn engine get above the rotational speed or throttle
opening at which it moves to the normal air-fuel ratio, and staying in
top gear to take traffic-free roundabouts without touching clutch or
brakes.
Accelerating downhill but slogging uphill, and adjusting your approach
speed to try to reach all traffic lights at green, are part of a process
which is hardly as exhilarating as romping up some mountain climb, but
has an interest of its own and certainly makes the driver much more
aware of the traffic situation ahead.
Driven even in a less extreme manner, and also when cruised at
appropriate speeds on motorways, the 1.8-litre Carina is an
exceptionally economical car, easily achieving fuel returns which in its
class would otherwise be attainable only by diesels.
The official figures for the five-door CDX are 54mpg at 56mph, 43 at
75 and 34mpg around town.
But is this Carina boring on the road? Not for me, because the extra
engine capacity over the 1.6 provides a 103bhp power output, better
torque, a 0-60mph time reduced to under 12 seconds, and a test-track
maximum around 118mph.
If you go out of economy mode by flooring the throttle, the 1.8-litre
engine will perform quite strongly. Driven more briskly, the CDX also
shows itself to be a well balanced car, sweeping through a series of
bends with easy control, although the suspension is not so happy coping
with humps. Even so, it is still the impressive combination of passenger
space and steady-speed economy which makes this a family or business car
to be taken seriously.

AN appeal for the leaders of Britain's #100bn food and drink industry
to recognise the importance of local producers was made at the Royal
Highland Show yesterday by Mrs Barbara Kelly, president of Scottish
Rural Forum.
''While I recognise the supermarkets' need to stock multi-national
produce I appeal to them to find space to display local regional produce
on their shelves,'' she said.
There must be some way in which small regional producers could find
shelf space, she told guests at the opening of the Food from Scotland
exhibition at the show.
Mrs Kelly, a farmer's wife and a former director of Scottish
Enterprise, said that both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise recognised the importance of adding value to Scotland's
primary produce.
''The competition is tough but our reputation in Scotland is high,''
she said. ''We have a priceless asset in our clean environment and
customers will seek out food they know to be of a quality and freshness
such as we can provide in Scotland.''
Geoffrey John, chairman of Food from Britain, said that the British
food industry was renowned for its outstanding raw material. Annual
exports were worth #9000m, he said, but the potential for expansion was
vast. Home produce accounted for 85% of the domestic market in Britain
but on the European scale we had only 1%.
The head of the Scottish Enterprise food team, Lorna Jack, said that
food exports from Scotland were currently worth #380m. In the past year
they had gone up by 15%.
Yesterday's soaring temperatures and blue skies made it one of the
best opening days for the show in recent years. Visitors from the west
encountered a two-mile tail back from early morning as show traffic
added to the normal commuter congestion.
The heat proved a problem for pet dogs which had been left in cars.
Police and SSPCA inspectors had to break into a number of vehicles to
relieve distressed animals.
It was a particularly sunny day for beef farmer Alan Lyburn of
Blairgowrie who was named by the Meat and Livestock Commission as
Scotland's top livestock farmer. The award is given in respect of good
stockmanship with excellent physical and financial herd performance.
Mr Lyburn's performance, recorded under the Signet Beefplan, showed
gross margins per hectare of #527 for his 60 autumn calves and #799 for
100 spring calves. Until three years ago he used to overwinter the
spring calves until the recording system showed this was simply not
paying enough. Now these calves go to the late autumn sales.
In addition to his suckler cows Mr Lyburn also runs a 440-strong ewe
flock. Scottish sheep farmer of the year is David Soutar who manages the
Strathmore Farming Company at Glamis for the Earl of Strathmore. The
winning unit was at Dryburn Farm, Glen Ogilvy, where 820 mainly
blackface ewes form part of a 1350-ewe flock looked after by sheep unit
manager Graeme Kerr. The flock has been gradually expanded from 600 ewes
in 1990 with the help of two polytunnel sheep sheds for winter housing
of Blackface ewes carrying twins.
All lambs are sold on a deadweight contract to meet specifications
laid down by the customer -- a major High Street store. One-third of the
lambs were finished by the end of October at 20kg deadweight and
averaged #39.72.
The results from Dryburn showed a gross margin of #57.50 per ewe and
#690 per hectare over the inbye grass.
The Hon Mrs Fiona Dalrymple of Oxenfoord Mains, Dalkeith, is Scottish
Pig Producer of the Year. Finished pigs from the 100-sow unit are sold
through the Scotlean marketing group to the Malton Bacon Factory.
Oxenfoord Mains is an 840-acre farm, mostly arable. The pig unit
provides cash flow throughout the year and dung and slurry for the land.
Day-to-day management is in the hands of Donald McFarlane.
Results show an average of 2.47 litters per sow/gilt each year and an
average of 22 pigs reared.
The Scottish pig industry also received a major boost as Ross-shire
farmer David Whiteford, chairman of the Scottish Pig Industry
Initiative, announced that promotional spending in Scotland by the Pork
and Bacon Council is to be doubled -- reaching a level of #500,000.
Glasgow's Eastbank Academy, a city-centre school, was named yesterday
as overall winner in the Scottish Farm and Countryside Education Trust
Schools Challenge competition.
A four-girl team from the school adopted the challenge set by the
Royal Bank of Scotland -- major sponsors of the Highland Show -- to
identify alternatives to traditional upland farming.
Their list of possible diversifications included tourism, wind
farming, the introduction of species of goats for mohair production or
simply abandoning the land.

FOR someone who taught in a Roman Catholic school for 15 years, Hugh
McLoughlin displays a strange unawareness of the way in which his own
school operates (June 13).
I chose to send my children to the local comprehensive school --
''non-denominational'' I think is the politically correct title. At that
school they were looked after by a concerned and caring guidance staff.
I know for sure that among these were Protestants, Roman Catholics and
others of no strong religious persuasion.
Mr McLoughlin must be aware that his school would not have employed
these teachers unless certain religious criteria were fulfilled. He will
also be aware that this would also apply to assistant head teachers,
depute rector, and to the head teacher.
If he is in further doubt, I would refer him to the situations vacant
list in the pink section of Tuesday's Herald.
In the light of all this, perhaps Mr McLoughlin would like to define
''sectarian''.

IT'S apparently been sitting smack bang in the middle of the southern
constellation of Centaurus for aeons, but it wasn't until last August
that an X-Ray telescope and some nifty detective work by a Cambridge
University scientist came the closest we've ever been to ''seeing'' a
black hole.
The development, detailed for the first time in this week's Nature
magazine, has set the scientific community abuzz and, apparently, opened
the door for a whole new era of black-hole trackings.
In scientific terms what Professor Andy Fabian and his Japanese
colleagues identified was a ''gravitationally redshifted emission
implying an accretion disk and massive black hole in the active galaxy
MCG-6-31-15.''
In lay terms, they trained their X-ray telescope on to what they
believed to be a black hole in another galaxy and noticed a clear
distortion in the X-Ray spectrum coming off the material which was
apparently swirling around the hole. That distortion, or gravitational
redshift, fits the profile of black-hole behaviour exactly. The
equipment they used allowed them to get 10,000 times closer than anyone
else had been.
Speaking yesterday, Professor Fabian admitted the discovery was
significant but was leery about suggestions that he had more or less
proved the existence of black holes.
''It shows that the effect is there. It fits with the kind of gravity
you expect around a black hole. Proof is very difficult in astronomy . .
. but it's the closest evidence yet of black holes.''
The idea of a black hole was first mooted by Einstein's general theory
of relativity in 1915. Two years later Martin Schwarzschild firmed up
the notion and the phenomena were called Schwarzschild's Singularities
until the 1960s, when looser speech patterns spawned the term black
hole.
Depending on which scientist you quiz, the universe is alternatively
riddled and/or dotted with black holes. From the early 70s, it was
thought the quasars, the brilliant star-like objects, were probably
galaxies forming, powered by super-size black holes at their centre. If
that theory is correct, it could be that every galaxy, including our
own, has a massive black hole in the middle.
Professor Fabian said the way ahead would be to apply the technique to
other apparent black holes and the development of bigger and more
sophisticated telescopes would allow a much closer look at this
distortion feature.
Up at Glasgow University's astronomy department Dr Robin Green
confirmed that Dr Fabian's find was significant and would move the study
of black holes forward. ''I think it will trigger some efforts to verify
this, yes. I think it is quite significant from that point of view.''
Current thinking suggested that there were four black holes in our own
galaxy, he said, but on the lines of the quasar theory it was also
thought by some that there might be a massive black hole at the centre
of our own galaxy.
''There could well be. There's certainly something at the centre,
something pretty strange.''

PAUL Ince changed his mind yesterday and signed a three-year contract
with Inter-Milan.
The Manchester United midfield player looked set to reject the #7m
move after having been reassured by United manager Alex Ferguson that he
still had a future at Old Trafford. But Ince -- stunned when he learned
United were willing to let him go to Italy -- decided to accept Inter's
offer.
Inter, who have just sold Dennis Bergkamp to Arsenal for #7.5m, hope
Ince will become the inspiration of a team being rebuilt. The player's
decision is bound to shock United, whose chairman, Martin Edwards,
thought that Ferguson's guarantee about the midfielder's future would
persuade him to stay at Old Trafford.
And while Ince pledged himself to the Inter cause, AC Milan have
stated that they are about to bring Portuguese forward Paulo Futre from
Reggiana to the San Siro.
A spokesman for the Milan side said that 29-year-old Futre will sign a
one-year contract within the next few days after terms for his transfer
fee were agreed by the two clubs.
But while the news was good for two of Italy's top sides, the same
cannot be said for Rangers. Ibrox manager Walter Smith will shortly
return from holiday in the USA, and his first act may be to jettison the
#2.7m bid for Romanian striker, Florin Raducioiu.
More delays hit the transfer of the player yesterday. He has gone on
holiday and is then going back to his own country. And, in the midst of
his movements, the Espanol president announced yesterday: ''We would
like to keep the player here in Barcelona.''
However, insiders at the club maintain that they are determined to
sell the Romanian, and that his problems are arising because he is
wanting a massive pay-off on a contract which has still two years to
run.
* ARSENAL have already sold almost 500 replica shirts -- costing
almost #48.50 each -- bearing Dennis Bergkamp's name.

AN annoucement is expected this morning on the future of Southern
Hemisphere rugby. Dr Louis Luyt, of the South African Rugby Football
Union, and representatives from Australia and New Zealand are about to
confirm the start of a competition in that part of the world that will
rival the Five Nations' Championship.
Negotiations have been going on for some time about a three-way
tournament, on a home-and-away basis, between the three big powers in
the sport.
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media tycoon, is understood to have
been in contact with the countries concern, and the advent of his money
could mean rugby union turning professional just after the World Cup.

ALL 20 stones of 20-year-old New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu look pretty
lonely here in Johannesburg.
He's not allowed to talk to the press, and Shell South Africa offered
to pay 5000 Rand (about #1000) to rugby development for each time the
big man is legitimately tackled tomorrow -- an incentive they later
withdrew, offering it instead for each try the Springboks score. A new
volcanic island has appeared in Tonga and it is to be called Lomu.
The New Zealand Rugby Football Union are to try to keep him in the
game and away from Rugby League offers, but all they can promise is that
Lomu will be on the plane back to New Zealand with them after the final.
After that, they say, it's entirely up to him.
No wonder Brian Lochore, the New Zealand campaign manager, has
bemoaned the lack of enjoyment for the players in modern top-level rugby
on the eve of the biggest match in the history of world rugby. ''When I
toured here as an All Black, we played maybe four Tests,'' he says in
the coolness of the Holiday Inn's verandah, out of the glare of this
incredibly warm winter sun.
''I got to know the opposition players over a few beers, and I
respected them all the more for that. Then the next weekend we knocked
lumps out of each other again. I could go the length of South Africa and
stay with good friends that I met then.
''It isn't the same for the current players, though. They play once.
There is no second chance on Saturday.''
Lochore bemoans the media attention that has been heaped on Lomu.
''Frankly, I find some of it disgusting,'' he says, referring to the
South African obsession with Lomu, which has now reached the stage where
Jo'burg punters are invited to phone in on local radio with their
suggestions as to how he should be tackled.
I nearly pulled off the road when one bloke said that James Small
should jump on his back and put his hands over Lomu's eyes. A priest
phoned in suggesting an elephant gun.
''If we as a country were ever to do something similar, then I would
not be a proud New Zealander,'' says Lochore. ''It's okay to make a star
out of a very good player, but it's another thing to offer financial
reward for stopping an individual in a team game. If that's the way the
game's going then, frankly, I'm not interested. It's another example of
the modern player missing out on the fellowship of the game.''
I'll say they miss out on fellowship. After the England versus New
Zealand game last weekend the post-match function lasted for 20 minutes
and then both teams boarded a plane for Pretoria. Rugby will soon be
like football, with teams hardly socialising after a game.
Meanwhile, the South Africans, who have rather cleverly manoeuvred
themselves into the position of underdogs for Saturday, presented a
united front in further pursuit of their ''one team, one country''
slogan. Golfer Ernie Els, black football captain Mark Maponyane, and
cricketer Fanie de Villiers have all done their bit to back the Boks as
they get ready to go into battle.
But the menacing shadow created by Lomu is there for all to see. Full
back Andre Joubert had a smile on his face when the inevitable question
came to him as to how he would cope if he was landed in the same
position as Mike Catt had been when left all alone, with nowhere to
hide, and Lomu advancing.
''Well,'' said Joubert, ''he has to get round James Small first. It's
a team sport and no man will be allowed to dominate. I think that James
will tackle him.'' The whole of South Africa undoubtedly hopes that
Small does exactly that.
Francois Pienaar, the South African captain, thinks that his team has
the edge. ''We always wish the best for Ernie Els, and the football
team. What a great occasion we are looking forward to now. We have the
support, we have the talent, and we have the commitment.''
Fanie de Villiers -- whose own game, cricket, was the first to develop
a multi-racial attitude -- says that it is good to see that rugby did
so, too. ''We took a lead and I am glad that rugby followed on,'' he
said.
Soccer player Mark Maponyane also sees the political benefits of
unity. ''It is good to see Chester Williams in the team,'' he said. ''I
think that this does unite the whole country.'' Williams nodded.
Whatever, come tomorrow morning, all talk will be of the game itself.
New Zealand versus the South Africans, Ellis Park, Saturday. It's enough
to make your mouth water.

THEY used to say that radio hams had friends in every city, and none
in their own. They were hooked on the idea of communication with people
they had never met, doomed to sit in their attics with their electronic
gear, reaching out in the dark for contact with another mind.
The same could be said for the net-junkies, people addicted to the
notion of instant access to information systems around the world.
There is a new generation of computer nuts who sit huddled in front of
screens, diving into a vast cauldron of electronic info-soup, scooping
what they want. Until now it has been a lonely business but, with the
advent of the cyber cafe, the net junkies are coming out into the light
of day.
Before we progress, there are two points to explain. Cybernetics is
the study of the mechanical brain. The Internet is the result of the
computer user's compulsion to spread information as if he or she carries
a rabid electronic virus that demands new hosts. The net is spreading.
If you want to see pictures of bodybuilders, male or female, access
them at the cyber cafe. Need to know all about ticks and lice? Hook into
the Entomology Gallery while you sip the espresso. Wait until dark and
you can surf your way to Hell -- the on-line guide to satanism.
For most people, the cyber cafe is just computer hype, but it will
catch on. There are two in Scotland, plans for a third within weeks, all
in Edinburgh. A fourth will hit Glasgow soon. Other cities and towns
will surely follow.
Cyberia, in Edinburgh's Hanover Street, was the first cyber cafe in
Scotland, opening two days ahead of competition on April 12. Run by
Gavin Nicholson, it's a place where computer freaks can come up for air
and where the curious can take their first ''fix''.
''We were the first in Edinburgh, the first in Scotland, and we plan
to open in Glasgow in mid-August,'' says Nicholson, former director of a
catering supply firm. He had on-line experience and wanted to get into
the info-tech business.
''When Cyber in London opened last year I had to go down and see for
myself. I liked it and decided to make a go of it up here.
''Our intention is access for all at a reasonable cost in a friendly
cafe environment instead of something that's so hi-tech it's
intimidating. Here we have point and go. We have a World Wide Web
windows' interface, because it's so easy to use. Point, click, and
you're there. You can go anywhere in the world, instantly. It's pretty
amazing.''
So what is a cyber cafe?
''It's a cafe with a lot of personal computers,'' Nicholson says --
and so it is; there are 15, staring you in the face. Some folk come in
for a coffee and a bite. Others are on-screen, browsing. It's all very
different and very new, but, like games arcades, it's a different
diversion, the latest thing. Rates are #2.50 for a half hour, #2 for
pensioners and unemployed.
''At least one cyber-guide will be available at all times, and the
guide speaks in English, using ordinary language, not tech-speak. He
will get you started and you can take it from there.
''A very wide range of people are coming in to use the machines. Our
youngest regular is a seven-year-old girl. The oldest client is in his
90s. He comes in to hook up with his son in California.''
So is this the place for people who have friends in cities all over
the world and none at home?
Nicholson thinks not. ''When people come in they talk among themselves
because they keep finding interesting places to go to and they always
want to share that information with someone else. It is a classless
thing.''
At WEB 13, where Mark Gibbons and Ian McCarron opened the country's
second cyber cafe, in Bread Street in Edinburgh's Tollcross, there are
two sizeable rooms: one side is a cafe and restaurant with computers
around the walls; the other side has five more computers, and an area
where they take bookings.
''We have been very busy,'' Gibbons says. ''We rent out a PC for #3.50
an hour. One of the staff will guide you on to the net.
''We are also doing the whole on-line Festival Fringe programme, an
Internet version of the festival magazine where anybody can come on to
do or read reviews, book tickets, or get tourist information. We have
gig guides and lots of Scottish info.''
So what kind of people want to come in for coffee and a cyber dive?
''A lot of elderly people, which is a great surprise. Some of them
want to find out what it's all about. There's a lot of adventurous
senior citizens out there.
''Some come in to get in touch with their relatives. They put a
message on the e-mail and fire it off to friends abroad.
''Most people at the moment don't have an Internet access of their
own. We sell mailboxes to our customers for #1 a week which gives them
their own Internet address. Compared with the cost of buying a computer
and modem it's a huge saving. And it's a nice place to come in for a
coffee, too.
''We have 13 terminals. They cost about #13,000 which is just the tip
of the iceberg of our investment, and already we are getting a return on
our money,'' says Gibbons.
So what do people want to find when they turn on, boot up, and drop
right in?
''NASA is a very popular address on the net, with the space-related
programmes, access to Hubble Space Telescope pictures, the space
advances. So is the Louvre. You can access hundreds of different works
of art. Also the Cardiff Movie Data Base with a huge bank of information
on every film that's ever been made.''
The next cyber cafe is set to open in Cockburn Street in Edinburgh
where Rob and Eileen Henderson are launching Frenetics in July.
Rob Henderson says: ''We want to provide a number of services and we
hope to be able to publicise the old Edinburgh on the Internet. We also
want to provide a place where people can come and use technology without
having to know a great deal about it. The service will benefit local
business, too.
''On the net we can get images on line from various galleries and I
want to capitalise more on an arty atmosphere as opposed to hi-tech. I'm
a system designer with 15 to 20 years of computer experience and I'm a
great believer in tech for the masses. We want to make this the
superhighway which is available to everyone.
''Frenetics will be a place to have a coffee or a meal and if you want
to use the Internet you just switch on.''
It is only a matter of time until we are all on the net with our own
personal computers, communicating at light speed with the rest of the
world. And then the cafe will go back to being a place where we can get
a coffee and a croissant, chat up the talent, and watch the real world
go by.

SERGI Bruguera, twice winner of the French Open, has withdrawn from
the Wimbledon championships, which begin on Monday, and Steffi Graf has
gone back to Germany for treatment to her right rist.
Bruguera, who was seeded No.8 seed, claims his doctors have told him
not to play on grass as it may aggravate his already painful knees.
Boris Becker also is in Germany receiving treatment for a calf strain
and, along with Graf, missed yesterday's memorial service for Fred Perry
in London. Graf's injury is not thought to be serious, and Andre Agassi,
who has been suffering from hip trouble, yesterday declared himself

England 9, France 19
NEWS of John Major's resignation filtered through to the Loftus
Versfeld press box eight minutes from the end.
Maybe he can be blamed for many things, but for him to carry the can
for this dismal showing by England represents devotion to the national
cause above and beyond the call of duty. England were woeful and had it
not been for a late injection of French flair this would have been a
dismal advertisement for Northern Hemisphere rugby.
Perhaps England can make the excuse that this was the first time in
the tournament they had played in the rarefied atmosphere of the high
veld. But it would be a pretty lame excuse if it was proffered.
France wanted to win more than England. Truthfully, the third place
play-off game is one game too many. No doubt there has to be a system to
decide who gets the bronze medal -- and with the ludicrous RWC decision
that all but the top three sides from this tournament must qualify for
1999, there was more at stake this year than previously -- but it was
clear that for much of the proceedings the players' minds were on other
things.
They may have been here in person, but England, especially and
collectively, were already at the Jan Smuts airport check-in desk.
England had three penalty goals from Rob Andrew and rarely looked like
scoring a try.
Three instances sum up their lethargic display. When Rory Underwood
and Ian Hunter both kicked to touch on the full, and when Mike Catt --
who had an awful game -- misjudged a Franck Mesnel kick to the corner
flag the message was clear. England's world cup ended when they were
steamrollered by New Zealand last weekend.
France, who logged their first victory over England since 1988, more
than deserved their win. The game is supposed to be about scoring tries
and they had two. England, once again, finished a Test match with
nothing to show for their ''efforts'' but penalty goals. They really
must drive their supporters wild with despair.
England manager Jack Rowell said later that to play Australia, New
Zealand and France within the space of 10 days had been a mammoth task
for his side.
A dejected Will Carling added: ''It wasn't lack of skill that cost us
the game. It was just very hard to pick ourselves up after New Zealand
at the weekend.''
Carling said that he would now go away to think about his future.
The omens for England were writ large from the opening minute when Rob
Andrew failed with a simple penalty effort on the French twenty-two.
Fifteen minutes later, following a scrummage near the England line,
Galthie and Sadourny combined to come close to a try but England
conceded a penalty and Thierry Lacroix pushed the ball wide of the
posts.
Andrew opened the scoring after 24 minutes with a 40-metre penalty
goal after the French had fallen foul of referee David Bishop at a
lineout.
Eight minutes later, following a most blatant lineout foul by Olivier
Roumat on Martin Bayfield -- the Englishman collapsing like a dynamited
skyscraper -- Andrew was again off target with the penalty attempt.
Just before half-time came the first signs that France were taken the
game more seriously than England.
Galthie, Mesnel, Sadourny, Benazzi, and Cabannes combined to thrust
play deep into English territory. The wingers, Saint Andre and N'Tamack
kept momentum going and Mesnel was almost through for a try, but England
were caught offside and Lacroix equalised with the penalty goal.
In the first minute of the second half Ben Clarke was penalised for
rough footwork on Gonzales -- harshly it must be said -- and Lacroix
kicked France into the lead with the penalty goal.
Rob Andrew equalised with his second penalty goal 10 minutes later and
in 55 minute Lacroix, who ends the tournament with 112 points overtaking
Gavin Hastings as the tournament's top scorer, put over his third
penalty goal to put France back in front.
The first try of the match -- with the crowd chanting ''boring,
boring'' -- came on the hour mark. Olivier Roumat rumbled over with
driven lineout ball to make it 14-6 in favour of the French.
Andrew clawed back some points for England with a penalty goal two
minutes later but by now the French were showing that they were by far
the better side.
France sealed it in the last moment of regular time when N'Tamack --
who scored the late try that ended Scotland's hopes -- ran on to a
finely judged Galthie pass and, displaying perfect poise and balance,
raced through a mass of English defenders to touch down, Andrew's futile
try-line tackle impeding his stately progress not one whit.
England came back in injury time but it was much too late. Martin
Bayfield was knocked out cold in the dying moments, lying prostrate on
the pitch for a good few minutes after the final whistle.
It seemed that England had been in the same comatose state for
virtually the entire game.
England -- M Catt (Bath); I Hunter (Northampton), J Guscott (Bath), W
Carling (Harlequins), captain, R Underwood (Leicester); R Andrew
(Wasps), D Morris (Orrell); J Leonard (Harlequins), B Moore

<TEXT>
TIM Henman's hopes of carrying British hopes into the semi-final stage
of the Nottingham Open bit the dust yesterday against world No.45 Todd
Woodbridge.
Henman, who earlier eliminated Swedish No.2 seed Jonas Bjorkman, never
hit the same form but fought well to earn the cheers of a partisan crowd
after having dropped serve in the opening game.
He broke straight back only to double-fault and go 3-4 behind, from
where Woodbridge closed the first set before going on to wrap up a 6-3,
7-6 success.
A rash of errors by both players made for an exciting second set and,
after Henman double-faulted to hand his rival the break at 4-2,
Woodbridge made the same blunder three times in succession to let Henman
back in it -- and was unhappy with home fans who loudly cheered his
mistakes.
At 3-2 up in the tie-break, Henman looked poised to square the match
but then netted a lazy back-hand volley to gift Woodbridge the
advantage. The Briton then battled to save two match-points but
Woodbridge recovered his poise to run out 7-4.
Earlier, Russia's Alexander Volkov became the latest seed to exit the
tournament, beaten in a two-sets clash of left-handers by determined
Argentine Javier Frana.

DESPITE a course record from Hilton Park assistant Stewart Russell,
Buchanan Castle's Keith Baxter will take a one-stroke lead into the
final two rounds of the Sunderland of Scotland Masters at Gleddoch
following his second five-under-par 67 yesterday.
The last time the club pro was 10-under-par for a tournament he was,
he said: ''Dreaming I was winning the Open.''
But short game tuition from Jim Farmer has boosted his confidence.
Yesterday he carded five birdies and 13 pars to move a shot clear of
former European Tour pro Peter Smith, of Deeside, so giving him every
chance of improving on his best Tartan Tour finish. He was second in the
1982 Falkirk District Council event.
Russell, 24, made his first cut in a 72-hole tournament with a
nine-under-par 63 across the 6357-yard parkland course in humid but
breezy conditions.
He described his putting as ''spooky'' after reverting to a
cack-handed style and requiring only 26 such strokes. He collected eight
birdies and an eagle -- he fired a No.8 iron to 10 feet at the 476-yard

KIMIKO Date won just three games when bowing out of the Direct Line
event yesterday at Eastbourne, beaten 6-3, 6-0 by unseeded American
Chanda Rubin.
But the world No.6 from Tokyo later blamed a lurid story in a Japanese
magazine for her downfall.
The magazine claimed that the tennis player's surprise arrival in the
semi-finals of the French Open was due to an affair with coach Kadru
Maruyama. ''There was no truth in that,'' said Date. ''But it has
affected my working relationship with my coach.''
Rubin now will meet Germany's Christina Singer, who beat Indonesian
Yayuk Basuki 6-4, 6-4, while the other semi-final will be between Natsha
Zvereva and Nathalie Tauziat who earlier defeated Lori McNeil.

A MAN was jailed for six years yesterday for two armed robberies.
However, Robert Sheehan was cleared at the High Court in Glasgow
robbing staff in a jewellery shop.
The court heard that Sheehan, 24, wore gloves while rifling the till
in a dairy in Paisley but had to ask a woman assistant to pick up the
pound coins for him.
Sheehan admitted robbing dairy staff of #115 last December while armed
with a knife. He also admitted robbing a young couple of #1573 outside a
bank in Paisley on January 7 last, while armed with a knife.
The Crown withdrew a charge of armed robbery of the jewellery shop, in
High Street, Paisley, last November.Jewellery worth #21,000 was taken.

A DOG branded a potentially dangerous American pit bull terrier and
ordered to be destroyed was reunited with her owner in court yesterday
after 15 months in police kennels.
Mr Mark O'Brien, 33, fought back tears when six-year-old Jessie
recognised him at Southwark Crown Court, in London.
After a 10-minute reunion, the dog was taken away by her police dog
handler to be returned to the kennels. Mr O'Brien, unable to speak, took
several minutes to recover.
The 18-inch high dog had been brought to court so that experts for the
defence could point out characteristics they maintain set Jessie apart
from the pit-bull terrier type.
Animal psychiatrist Dr Roger Mugford described Jessie as ''definitely
not a pit-bull terrier'' type. ''The proportions are quite wrong,'' he
told the court, adding that she was a ''timid'' animal.
Cross-examined by Mr Andrew Brierley, for the Crown, he said: ''She
has a perfect Staffordshire bull terrier head. I would say she is either
a Staffordshire or a Staffordshire cross.''
Last December Mr O'Brien, of Neasden, London, was found guilty of
allowing Jessie to stray in a public place, unmuzzled and unleashed,
contrary to the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act. He was fined #150 and heard a
mandatory death sentence passed on Jessie at Bow Street Magistrates'
Court.
He is appealing against that conviction and sentence on the grounds
that Jessie was wrongly categorised.
Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, reserved judgment until today.

I CONGRATULATE John Macleod on his excellent article (June 20). This
journalist has an excellent grasp of what it means to be a Christian,
unlike the ungodliness of McLaughlin, Purcell, Morton and Co (June 21).
The other ungodly crew, McFadden and Co (Co meaning Glasgow District
Council), show a total disregard for historic Christianity and the
traditions of Presbyterian Scotland.
The main thrust of all your correspondence on this subject appears to
be an appeal for tolerance. Certainly on a personal, one-to-one basis
Christianity teaches tolerance in our dealings with each other, but when
it comes to those things ''most surely believed'', a casual reading of
the New Testament (especially the Book of Acts) makes it clear that
Christianity is not a religion of tolerance but of utter intolerance --
intolerance of anything or anyone who stands in the way of the total
Lordship of Christ.
Jesus Christ is Lord, not Allah (a quite different god). Islam,
Buddhism, Hinduism, etc, are heathen religions.
The Church of Scotland particularly (on the whole) is a disgrace to
the nation. She has failed to uphold the glorious doctrines of the
Reformed Faith. She has betrayed her heritage and the Gospel of Jesus
Christ.
That is not to say that there are not faithful ministers within her
ranks upholding a true Christian witness.

I'M SURE Jean McFadden was not the only one to choke over her
cornflakes when confronted by John Macleod's article, The farce of token
religion (June 20).
Broad-minded Christians, humanists, Buddists, and Muslims are no doubt
saddened and disappointed that some still take a narrow and bigoted view
on religious and spiritual matters. Several points need to be addressed.
First, Glasgow is a multi-cultural, multi-faith society and is all the
richer for it. It is therefore entirely right that our councillor should
patronise the mosque as much as attend Catholic and Protestant services.
Better community relations and promoting tolerance in a city once
notorious for bigotry and sectarianism are aims worth striving for and
Glasgow can be proud of its achievements in these areas.
Second, in these days of rapidly falling church rolls, Scotland can no
longer be seriously called a Christian country. History indicates that
politics and religion don't mix. People feel alienated by our national
church and are turning instead to independent (often evangelical)
churches, which emphasise a personal faith rather than adherence to
religious dogma.
Third, there is of course a strand of fanatical Islam. It bears little
resemblance to the teachings of Muhammed and the Koran, just as extreme
forms of Protestant and Catholic Christianity are far removed from the
Bible and the teachings of Jesus. Neither all Muslims or Christians
deserve to be tarred with the same brush.
The Muslim faith in Bosnia for instance has for many years been known
for its tolerance and freedom. It is outrageous for John Macleod to
suggest that they are responsible for the ''massacres in the Balkans''.
That war as we all know is being perpetuated by Orthodox Christian
Serbs.

AT first sight I thought Shell's embarrassing climbdown over the Brent
Spar was an amusing spectacle. The loss of face for the Government is
particularly satisfying at a time when the Tories seem to be on the
brink of disaster. None the less I have no respect at all for those
self-appointed global policemen who have campaigned against Shell's
plans to dump the storage platform.
The poverty of scientific debate on the pros and cons of the plan
suggests that real environmental damage has never been the issue. Helmut
Kohl's long-distance protests showed that the political fallout was far
more extensive than the material one.
The world is interlinked in all sorts of ways, but the dumping of a
heap of scrap 150 miles off the coast of Scotland simply does not affect
the lives of Germans in any material way. In all likelihood it would
have no impact on Scots, or anyone else for that matter. The plan became
a global issue for entirely unscientific reasons.
Greenpeace never even claimed to know what impact the dumping would
have. It is ''unpredictability'' that they object to. Given the lack of
evidence that the platform would really damage the Atlantic Ocean (and
the genuine problems of bringing radioactive waste ashore), surely the
best policy would be to dump the Brent Spar and see what happens.
Greenpeace call it irresponsible, but who are they to say anyway?
The environmentalist vision of ''global responsibility'' is based on a
quasi-religious fear of human interference in nature. Greenpeace do not
have a lot to say about underwater volcanoes pumping toxic material into
the oceans, yet compared to these the Brent Spar is insignificant.
European governments and British opposition parties have their own
political reasons for jumping on the bandwagon. Greenpeace can now claim
a victory for ''morality''. In my view Shell's caving-in to the
moralistic ''careful now'' lobby is a victory for irrationalism.

THREE years of extensive research and consultation and Shell decides
to dump the Brent Spar buoy at sea. Apparently marine scientists agreed
that this was the best practicable environmental option. The risks to
the deep marine ecology are said to be slight.
Greenpeace has been successful in stopping this practice for the time
being and whipping up a frenzy of public protest. What Greenpeace may
have achieved, however, is to create a lot of other environmental
problems for a large number of communities. Has Greenpeace considered
the wider consequences of its actions? Only time will tell.
In a recent period of study at the Graduate School of Environmental
Studies at Strathclyde University, it became apparent to me that you
cannot just be an environmentalist and oppose every single process an
industry goes through. Every environmental decision is a compromise, and
reaching that decision is difficult and complex.
Decision-makers need to have a good understanding of how the whole
environment interacts: by stopping one action you will create the need
for another.
Perhaps the real victory for Greenpeace has been to put the
environment back on the public agenda and given a lesson to Shell that
they must involve environmental pressure groups at an early stage of
their future environmental decision process.

CHAMPIONSHIP quality was the major feature of the beef cattle classes
with all the judges remarking favourably on the class winners and
supreme animals.
One decidedly interested spectator during the Aberdeen-Angus judging
was Chris Gilbert Wood, the technical manager in the meat department of
Marks &amp; Spencer. He keenly surveyed the parade of Scotland's most famous
breed.
His interest was obvious when he said: ''We've been buying Angus beef
since 1990 because it consistently comes out on top in our tasting
panel. Quite simply we cannot get enough and we're always on the lookout
for more.
''I'm really impressed with the cattle here today and it's good to see
that breeders are producing the right sort of well-fleshed cattle that
we want.''
M&amp;S purchases its Angus beef from the Bridge of Allan firm of
Scotbeef, but the chairman of that company, Ian Galloway, had to rest
content with the reserve championship when Fred McQuater, Monkwood Mill,
Maybole, took the title with his five-year-old Canadian-bred bull, Wiwa
Creek Star.
The Charolais classes produced a grand show of females but the bulls
with one or two notable exceptions were of a more average quality. To
no-one's great surprise the championship went to the eight-year-old cow
Kelton Celeste from Gelston Castle Farms, Castle Douglas. This cow was
the supreme beef animal at Ayr and yesterday's championship was her 23rd
victory. Leading her out was David Grant who commented: ''She's a super
cow and a great breeder due to calve again in September.''
Standing reserve was the four-year-old cow Seawell Generosity from
Peter Donger of Northants. This one's dam, Kilkenny Celia, has in the
past been overall beef champion at Ingliston.
The Highland ring was busy with visitors from all over the world, in
Scotland for the Society's first international conference, watching
closely. From a record entry the eventual winner proved to be the
seven-year-old cow Beitidh Four of Glenquoich from Stewart Brown,
Ringour, Dumfries. This one was purchased in Oban as a heifer for 4500
guineas.
Strength in depth was the feature of the Galloway classes but no-one
could match Jim Ross from Romesbeoch, Dumfries, who continued his great
record in the show ring taking both the championship and the reserve
with two outstanding cows.
Jim Biggar, who has been showing at Highland shows for longer than he
cares to remember, was once again in the limelight taking the beef
shorthorn championship with his four-year-old bull Tofts Romany. In
addition, Mr Biggar and his son Donald saw a bull which they bred lift
the leading Hereford award for J W &amp; R Johnson from Nottingham.
The Simmental championship saw a very popular win for Robert Crawford,
Tillylair, Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire, with his five-year-old cow
Tillylair Angela beating the noted show-winner Brinkton Melody from Bob
Luness, Humberside.
Down in the sheep rings, competition was equally keen with John
Forsyth, Glenside, Maybole, repeating his Ayr win in the Border
Leicester section with an outstanding gimmer. The Suffolk championship
for once went south in the shape of a two-shear ram from John Sinnett,
Stockton Court, Worcester, while John Young, Guthrie Port, Arbroath,
emerged on top yet again in the commercial section with his Suffolk
crosses.
Award for fish firm.
THE Arbroath fish processing firm, R R Spink &amp; Sons, fishmongers to
the Queen and Queen Mother, received the RHS Export Excellence Award --
sponsored by Scottish Enterprise -- at the show yesterday.
Presenting the award, Lorna Jack of Scottish Enterprise said: ''We
were particularly impressed by the export achievements of the firm who
started exporting its range of fish in 1992.
''In three years it has made great inroads into the French market and
following extensive consumer research is aiming to secure new orders in
Germany. The company is also hoping to develop markets in Hong Kong and
the Far East.''
The firm exports mainly smoked salmon, cod and mackerel, but are known
throughout Britain as producers of the famed ''Arbroath Smokie'' --
smoked haddock.
Tree project.
A VIDEO project was launched atthe show yesterday to encourage
landowners to help safeguard the future of Scotland's native woodlands.
Wool boost.
A NEW breed of sheep officially launched at the could boost incomes
from wool.
Lomond sheep, the result of a six-year breeding programme involving
Merino and Shetland sheep, is claimed to produce high-quality fine wool
not available from other breeds.
Fergus Wood, director of the Scottish Fine Wool Project, which is
backed by Scottish Enterprise, said: ''We now have over 1000 breeding
ewes at 24 farms from Shetland to the Borders and the extra value of the
finer wool that Lomond sheep yields should be worth #12 more to farmers.
''The extra income from this textile-quality fleece will come without
affecting the primary quality lamb.''

IT'S no use Michael Fry trying to discredit the European protest about
Brent Spar as an ''irrational'' reaction to crazed Green extremists
(Britain in black book of German Greens, June 21).
The fact is that public feeling, both here and abroad, is no longer
expressed through the almost indistinguishable political parties, but
through much more elusive groupings of people who see that human life
will only continue if we refrain from destroying the natural structure
which supports us.
Michael Fry's ''rag-bag of malcontents'' cannot be written off with
such contemptuous ease. It includes deeply thoughtful and concerned
people, who are rightly appalled by the British Government's
determination to abet Shell in this shoddy act of ecological vandalism.
I, for one, am profoundly grateful for their intervention.

TURNING to The Herald Essay (June 17), I found the illustration
off-putting, but having nothing better to do at the time, started to
read. Heavy going initially, and as I progressed my distaste and
incredulity grew.
Could this be The Herald I was reading, and not some pamphlet thrust
into my hand at a street corner? What could be the editorial objective
in exposing its readers to this? The article makes a mockery of the
Christian faith which the writer claims to be upholding, and can only
irritate and antagonise any thinking person.
Of course there is much that is deplorable in our society today. But
Jack Thomson seems to live in a sort of cloud-cuckoo-land which casts a
golden glow over the past and sees the present as totally degenerate. He
needs to read some social history.
I can assure him that Christianity is alive and well in many parts of
Scotland -- even in some churches! And if The Herald is genuinely
interested in religion, why not print the Sermon on the Mount? It might
be News to quite a lot of people.

J FAULDS'S belief in a society based on Christian morality (June 19)
is a rather nice idea if such a society were based on openness and
enlightenment -- good Christian principles.
However, contrary to J Faulds's comments, such a society has never
existed in Britain. That is, unless by ''Christian morality'' he means
the narrow-mindedness and fear in the form of stigma that existed before
the 1950s which led to most rapes not being reported (and certainly
never male rape); child sexual abuse being swept under the carpet; and
homosexuality being practised in secrecy -- in addition to the hurt and
injustice caused to the victims.
Rape and child abuse have always been with us and it is only since the
casting off (although not yet completely) of so-called ''Christian
Morality'' that the crimes of rape and child abuse have been allowed to
be discussed and subsequently tackled.
Likewise, homosexuality has always been with us, the homophobia and
fear of the pre-1950s ''Christian morality'' being replaced today with
enlightenment and understanding of a perfectly natural sexual
persuasion.
It is enlightenment and understanding that are so lacking in J
Faulds's comments.

IN THE case of Robert E Lee, historians have often lamented the
blurring of the real man due to his deification by some of his more
zealous admirers (June 13).
He was a soldier almost without peer and he was a decent man. Some
found him modest and humane, some cold and distant. He had a vicious
temper which he fought constantly to subdue.
The choices he made in his life were unequivocal and made with full
knowledge of the political and moral dilemmas of his time.
The independence the South was fighting to protect was a system that
held one-third of its population to be mere property, and the agrarian
society they clung to was maintained by human bondage.
To suggest that Lee and ''all other Confederate soliders'', fought
only for ''independence'', is silly and disingenuous.
Lee was offered field command of the Union Army. Though he was
certainly no slavery or secession fanatic, he declined the offer and
chose to draw his sword for his country, Virginia, and the Confederacy.
He fought with the general officers of the Confederacy -- Nathan
Forrest, slave trading millionaire, afterwards first Imperial Wizard of
the Ku Klux Klan and John Hood, ''better to die a thousand deaths than
submit to you and your negro allies''.
He fought for the civilian population of the South. Above all he
fought for the Government of the Confederate States of America.
He was not a stupid man. He knew the nature of the people he was
serving with and the policy of the regime he was fighting for.
After the war a prominent Northerner wrote: ''Lee should have been
hanged. No matter that he was a good man. The good man always causes the
most harm.''
I don't believe he should have been hanged. But the conscious
decisions he made at that time of heart-rending conflict surely
disqualify him from the accolade from which his modesty would certainly
have recoiled, of ''the epitome of Christianity''.

NEIL KENNEDY states: ''Robert E Lee fought as did all other
Confederate soldiers, not to keep other human beings in bondage, but to
achieve Southern independence'' (June 13).
I believe some clarification is in order. Southern independence was a
means to preserve the ''Southern way of life''. Human bondage (slavery)
was central to that way of life.
Lee may have been opposed to slavery but he cast his lot with those
who did support slavery -- both wealthy Southerners who wanted to keep
their slaves and poor Southerners who wanted to be sure the blacks
stayed at the bottom of the social ladder.

THE Scottish legal system served landlords only too well 300 years
ago. Justice came fast and easy when your local laird also tended Bar at
the Regality or Barony court. This man did it all: judge, jury,
prosecutor.
Legend has it that a tenant was once sentenced to death at the
Regality court for the heinous crime of cutting the laird's green wood.
As the hangman was poised, ready to seal his fate, the tenant broke with
a lifetime of deference and cursed the landlord -- his wife spoke out
too: ''Weesht Wullie, dinae anger the laird.''
Such courts were abolished in 1746, yet if Wullie were alive today he
would no doubt be first in line for a probationary tenancy and thus
subject to another form of summary justice.
Probationary tenancies were mooted earlier this year in England by the
Department of the Environment. Last month the Scottish Office followed
suit with its own consultation paper. The idea is to give local
authorities power to put all new tenants on probation for a year, with a
view to tackling anti-social behaviour on housing estates.
During the probationary period the tenant could be evicted following
28 days' written notice. There would be no defence, no real court
involvement, and the only right of appeal would be to the landlord
within seven days of receiving the notice to vacate. In other words, for
eviction purposes, new tenants would be judged by their housing
department.
Such proposals were closely scrutinised this week at a national
conference in Dundee, organised by the Chartered Institute of Housing
and Dundee District Council. One question the conference asked was why
landlords needed any additional powers.
According to Housing Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, additional
powers would ''reassure existing tenants that landlords have the means
at their disposal to take rapid action to remove any new tenants
behaving anti-socially''.
What then of the existing legal remedies? The ultimate sanction for
problem tenants is eviction. There are some 20,000 eviction actions
raised every year in Scotland, the majority going quietly undefended for
rent arrears. But when it comes to eviction for anti-social behaviour
tenants are far more likely to defend -- no doubt because they regard
the allegations as a slur which cannot go unanswered.
Councils complain that it is virtually impossible to gather evidence
against anti-social tenants. For example, neighbours may be too scared
to testify for fear of reprisal. But there is no legal rule which says
neighbours must testify in court. They could provide evidence in the
form of written statements which housing officers could speak to in
court.
One of the current legal building blocks landlords can use is the
remedy of interdict. If a housing department has drafted its tenancy
agreement to include a detailed nuisance clause, explaining what the
tenant can and cannot do, it can ask the court for an interdict. If
breached, the tenant could face contempt of court proceedings with
criminal sanctions.
Not all local authorities make use of interdicts, yet one which does,
Dundee District Council, is a leading proponent of reform. As Carl
Donnachie, depute director of housing in Dundee, says: ''We've been
assiduous in finding ways to use the law, but as practitioners we still
see the need for probationary tenancies.''
Dundee's idea is to place any former tenant with rent arrears or a
history of anti-social behaviour on probation. But this would equate
poverty with anti-social behaviour and stigmatise countless numbers of
council tenants.
There is no real need for probationary tenancies in Scotland as the
law is more than capable of dealing with anti-social behaviour -- and
probationary tenancies will not necessarily make it easier for landlords
to evict.
All decisions of local authorities are subject to judicial review in
the Court of Session. If the landlord evicts but has insufficient
evidence then that decision could be challenged. Petition procedure in
Scotland's supreme civil court is far more expensive than pursuing an
action of eviction in the sheriff court -- so reform could result in
greater legal expense.
It should not be forgotten that anti-social behaviour is a relatively
small-scale problem in Scotland. For example, Dundee District Council
anticipates difficulty with about 15 to 20 anti-social tenants each
year. Do we really need a sledgehammer approach to housing management?

tenancies.

WHILE there may be ''no sex left in Lonrho'' according to Tiny
Rowland, the ousted founder of Lonrho, there are increased profits which
will cheer shareholders.
In the six months to end-March Lonrho's profit before tax excluding
exceptional items rose by #18m to #52m, an increase of 53%. The interim
dividend is 2.25p, up from 2p previously.
Mr Rowland made his comments following news earlier this week of the
merger of Lonrho's platinum interests with those of the South African
mining group Gencor, which he believes removes much of the upside for
the conglomerate.
However, the current Lonrho management under chief executive Dieter
Bock is confident about its trading future based on assuming critical
mass in its core business sectors of mining, hotels, agriculture and
general trade and in its key operating territories.
Non-core businesses will progressively be sold off. However, the group
remains committed to trading in Africa where it believes the long-term
prospects are good.
Restructuring action in the hotels division and within the African
businesses, which are now grouped together within a new company called
Lonrho South Africa, could lead to their flotation within the next year.
Lonrho would seek to retain a majority shareholding with the proceeds
from any flotation used to grow the businesses both organically and via
acquisition. Negotiations are already taking place on the acquisition of
possible hotel management contracts.
The hotel business performed strongly in the first six months of the
year, particularly the Metrople Hotel chain in the UK. Operating profits
jumped 64% to #23m helped by higher occupancy and room rates. Conference
bookings were notably strong in London and Birmingham. However, there
were also encouraging performances from Princess Hotels in North America
and the African hotels.
The mining division includes Ashanti goldfields and Lonrho's platinum
mines which are among the largest gold and platinum mines in world and
the lowest cost producers. Mining profits rose by #6m to #42m with the
business benefiting from higher platinum, palladium and nickel prices.
Zimbabwean profitability was impacted by the drought. Lonrho is on the
lookout for further growth opportunities in African mining.
The first half is traditionally quiet for the agriculture business.
Lonrho is the largest commercial food producer in Africa, where its
farming and ranching activities are carried out in 11 countries and on
one million acres of land. The division is dominated by the sugar
operations which are expected to remain the mainstay of agriculture
profits in the future.
Weak spots in the group include the UK retail textile business of
Brentfords which made a #5m loss. The 137-strong nationwide chain is
suffering from intense competition, higher raw material prices
principally for cotton and weak consumer demand as a result of the poor
housing market. The chain is being restructured into upmarket linen
stores competing against the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and cheaper
discount stores for the bottom end of the market.
The improved group operating performance and better control of working
capital resulted in an improvement in cashflow. The spectre of Tiny
Rowland continues to hang over Lonrho.
Mr Bock intends to exercise his option in December over Tiny Rowland's
remaining 6.3% stake in Lonrho. At Lonrho's current price in the market
of 151[1/2]p, up 1[1/2]p, it would cost Mr Bock just over #69m.
However, this action could result in legal action by Mr Rowland. Last
month he decided to end a lawsuit over the option plus claims for unfair
dismissal, although he remains free to resume legal action when Mr Bock
seeks to exercise the option. Mr Bock is already Lonrho's largest
shareholder with an 18.6% stake.

WORLDWIDE sales of Glenfiddich, Scotland's best-selling malt whisky,
soared 37% by volume during the first half of this year, the
family-owned distiller William Grant said.
William Grant officials said the boom in both export and domestic
sales was the result of restocking by distributors after a good
Christmas sales period and a more energetic marketing drive.
The company said ''significant increases'' had been registered in all
its major markets, including the UK, USA, France, Germany, Spain and New
Zealand.
William Grant officials denied suggestions that Glenfiddich had
boosted sales through price cuts, but declined to give figures for the
increase in sales by value.
Whisky analysts said Glenfiddich's exceptionally good sales
performance in an otherwise flat whisky market was due in part to its
recovery from a very low base.
''The brand had been sagging a wee bit,'' said Alan Gray of Sutherland
&amp; Partners in Edinburgh, who reckons that Glenfiddich accounted for
nearly 28% of worldwide malt whisky sales in 1993.
Thorold Mackie of Bell, Lawrie White agreed, noting that Glenmorangie,
another leading malt, had enjoyed a similar recovery.
Mr Mackie said Glenmorangie sales in the UK rose 24% by volume and 33%
by value during the year to March.
Exports also improved dramatically, with sales increasing 45% by
volume and 32% by value.
Mr Mackie said Glenmorangie's recovery was a result of sales pulling
off a low point and the distiller, Macdonald Martin, switching to new
distributors.
William Grant said it had only changed distributors recently in Spain.

<RECORDNO>977748148</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of brewer Fuller Smith &amp; Turner yesterday challenged
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and other Cabinet Ministers to visit Calais to
see for themselves the size of the imported beer trade which continues
to undermine business.
Beer sales suffered during the year to April 1 as volumes at its
tenanted pubs fell by 5% and the free trade by 3% from a combination of
recession in South-east England and imported cross-Channel cheaper beer.
Its managed pubs, however, fared better with volumes up by 2% and
sales to supermarkets raced ahead by 300%.
Chairman Anthony Fuller, who has frequently criticised the Government
over the increased duty it has imposed on beer, said: ''I despair of our
Chancellor continuing to disregard the impact that cheap beer from
Calais has on the British drinks industry.
''I challenge him and his fellow Cabinet Ministers to go there
themselves to see the size of the trade as my board and I have done.''
On a more positive note, he said beer sales so far this year have done
well despite the poor weather. They have increased by 7% in volume terms
and wine sales are up by 5%.
Exports to America rose by 3% and continue to expand, but exports
overall fell by 10% because of a downturn in other markets.
Pre-tax profits for the brewing, pubs and hotels group based in
Chiswick in west London climbed by 9% to #8.8m from #8m in the previous
12 months.
The profits were affected by several one-off provisions including a
#129,000 profit on the sale of unprofitable pubs and a #500,000 profit
on the disposal of its 75% stake in Classic Ales to Greenalls.
Those, however, were offset by redundancy costs totalling #683,000
which went to a number of employees who lost their jobs as well as two
directors made redundant.
The total dividend payout on the 'A' shares is increased to 8.375p
from 7.77p previously on earnings per share of 25.22p against 22.93p.
Its wine division enjoyed a 3% sales rise in its wholesale business
and 7%in its retail Quality Wine Merchants.
But a major success story came from its hotels operation which boosted
profits by 44%.

THE Prime Minister has plucked up his courage, picked up his gun, and
ventured into the electoral long grass. He need not have done it, but in
facing up to the rebels within his own party he has shown real courage
and a good deal of cunning. In the process he has lived up to the best
principles of his high office and, perhaps rather later than many of us
would have wished, recognised the fact that debilitating tensions within
the governing party are potentially damaging to the nation.
By resigning the leadership of his party Mr Major is theoretically
pursuing a high-risk strategy. His aim is to flush out his enemies and
stop them dead. It is most likely he will win the July leadership
election on the first ballot, but by facing his enemies and catching
them decidedly flat-footed yesterday he may also have disrupted their
machinations sufficiently to deter a serious stalking-horse in the mould
of Norman Lamont. A significant opponent might have wanted a summer of
increasing tensions which would have reduced Mr Major's stock further. A
snap election might call for a less prestigious opponent, though there
is no doubt that there are a number from the frothing anti-European
tendency who could be persuaded to stand.
Whatever the identity of his opponent, Mr Major deserves
congratulations for his abrupt decision to face up to his (and our)
problems. It seems an uncharacteristic action for a man who has always
seemed to be a compromiser by nature. That analysis of his essential
character must stand, though it can be acknowledged that the nature and
size of his majority has always made compromise a reasonable way of
proceeding.
Reasonable, that is, if you are dealing with reasonable people. The
minority within the Tory Party who have harried the Prime Minister on
numerous occasions, but principally on the European issue, are not
reasonable. They have snuffed what Mrs Thatcher was pleased to call in
different circumstances the oxygen of publicity, though in their case
the relevant gas appears likelier to have been helium. They have risen
very high on this by taking full advantage of Mr Major's weak position
in the House and because of his natural tendency to temporise whenever
possible. They have even, by their noise and clamour, and because of the
natural anxieties of considerable numbers of Tory MPs whose seats are
wobbly, managed to herd significant numbers of sheep into their pen, at
least temporarily. The shepherd has challenged them; he wants his sheep
back. Very probably he will get them back, though he must examine them
carefully to discern if any goats remain among them.
Other issues are raised by the extraordinary event in the Downing
Street rose garden yesterday. Earlier in the day Mr Major had been faced
by firm demands from elder statesmen in the party for a significant
Cabinet shuffle. By his decision to call the snap election he has
signalled defiantly that he will not be bounced into taking actions of
that sort at the behest of Sir Marcus Fox and his cronies. Much
speculation centred on the possibility that he might call a referendum
on the European issue. We are glad that he has not done this, first
because it is never a comfortable option for a liberal and
representative democracy, and secondly because the European debate in
this country has been characterised more by windbag rhetoric than by
solid, sensible discussion of the issues. Mr Major, it seems, will not
be rushed into a referendum either, and this suggests that he is not
prepared to commit yet another foolishness which has been urged on him,
that of lurching unsustainably to the right.
Two further issues remain. Mr Major may win the election but it is by
no means certain that he will win the war against the Euro-sceptics.
Anyone who has seen Bill Cash in full flow will doubt that he can be
turned back easily. The second issue concerns the wider electorate. The
Tory election circus will be watched with real interest, yet it is true
that a significant proportion of the British electorate would have
wished for a General Election rather than the ersatz version offered by
the Tories. We may be caught up by the spectacle of Major versus Mr (or
Mrs) X, but we must not forget that greater issues than that face the
nation. Nor will they go away.

UNITED Biscuits, which yesterday announced plans to sell its
loss-making US salty snacks business, will be lucky to realise #50m from
the disposal, according to City sources.
Assets of about $130m (#81m) are employed in the business, which is
part of United Biscuits' Keebler division.
News of the proposed sale comes little more than a month after
chairman Sir Robert Clarke warned that group pre-tax profits in the
first half of this year would be ''significantly below'' those earned in
the first six months of 1994.
The City welcomed yesterday's disposal news and shares in the
McVitie's biscuits and KP crisps and snacks group put on 5p to 337p.
John Parker, food manufacturing analyst at BZW, said: ''Debt is
mounting at United Biscuits and I think they are under pressure to try
and stop the remorseless growth of the borrowings.''
He was therefore not surprised the group was considering selling off
an underperforming part of the business.
However, John Warren, United Biscuits' finance director, said the main
driver of the proposed sale was not the reduction of corporate
borrowings but the fact that it had become clear it was going to require
a lot more resources than anticipated to move the salty snacks business
into profit.
Mr Warren, however, acknowledged that borrowings had been rising, as a
result of expansion in Continental Europe and the Asia Pacific region
and rationalisation in the US, UK and Continental Europe.
Borrowings totalled #460m at the end of last year, with gearing at
48%.
US salty snack sales totalled $192m (#119m) in 1994, accounting for
12% of Keebler's total turnover.
Edinburgh-registered United Biscuits, whose head office is in
Middlesex, wants to concentrate on its Keebler cookies and crackers
business, which is number two in the US with a market share of more than
16%.
United Biscuits chief executive Eric Nicoli said that, over the past
18 months, the group had worked to improve operational efficiency and
revitalise its Keebler snack brands, which include O'Boisie's,
Ripplin's, Pizzarias, Chacho's, Tato Wilds and Keebler pretzels.
However, like a number of other companies, United Biscuits has
struggled to reach critical mass in a market dominated by US giant
Pepsico's Fritolay brand.
The salty snacks operation employs about 550 people in Indiana,
Pennsylvania and Texas.
United Biscuits has appointed US investment bank Morgan Stanley to
assist with the proposed sale.
The group, which has on many occasions been cited as a possible
takeover target for Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson, hopes to complete the
sale of the salty snacks business by the end of the year.
Richard Allan, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, cited Pringle's crisps
group Proctor &amp; Gamble, Eagle snacks company Anheuser-Busch, and Nabisco
as potential purchasers.

MIKE Atherton might be miffed about chairman Ray Illingworth's
determination to pull rank over team selection for the second Cornhill
Test, but if anything makes the England captain consider quitting this
summer, it is likely to be the sight of the West Indies steamrollering
his team into the dirt.
Judging by the way England have started this summer, Illingworth would
struggle to find enough candidates to stage a leadership contest, unless
loyal fan John Major suddenly becomes available.
The Prime Minister was absent from Lord's yesterday, but the story was
much as he might have imagined with England slipping into trouble after
promising to bounce back from their nine-wicket Headingley defeat.
From 185 for three, they subsided to 205 for seven before debut boy
Dominic Cork and Peter Martin raised spirits just a little with a brave
partnership of 50. Even that bit of glory was snatched away as Cork fell
during the final over to leave England at 255 for eight.
While Curtly Ambrose and Co caused a fair amount of damage with
wonderfully accurate and, at times, frighteningly hostile fast bowling,
there was also trouble from an altogether unexpected source. Spinner
Carl Hooper, with just 48 wickets from 48 Tests before start of play,
struck two critical blows in the space of 13 deliveries.
Robin Smith was bowled for 61, dancing down the pitch but failing to
make contact with an intended clip through mid-wicket. Then Mark
Ramprakash snicked an attempted cover drive and departed for a duck.
Not even Graham Thorpe could steady England's ship after that double
strike. The left-hander, who had shared in a morale-boosting stand of
111 with Smith, edged Ambrose into Brian Lara's waiting hands at first
slip to spoil another solid, if not mistake free, half-century.
And when Darren Gough could only fend Ottis Gibson's wicked bouncer
into the gully, England were close to ruins.
At least those late-order runs had given Atherton's team just a
glimmer of hope.
The restored opening partnership of Atherton and Alec Stewart could
manage only a stand of 29 before Ambrose sent a swinging yorker crashing
into the captain's middle stump.
Then Graeme Hick, promising more than he could deliver yet again,
edged a defensive shot against Bishop during the last over before lunch.
Stewart's departure was even more wasteful. He had to stretch to reach
Gibson's short delivery outside off-stump but still managed to carve it
unerringly to Keith Arthurton at cover point.
Thorpe and Smith needed their moments of luck. They offered a total of
three slip catches, all of them difficult, but appeared to be guiding
England towards a reasonable first day's score. Enter Hooper -- and on
went that familiar West Indian stranglehold.

ARAVINDA de Silva produced a dazzling display of batting to chalk up
the highest innings of the season for Kent on the first day of their
championship clash at Nottingham.
But whereas most sides winning the toss made the most of favourable
conditions, Yorkshire were skittled for 96 by Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
Struggling Nottinghamshire had Kent reeling at 68 for five early on at
Trent Bridge -- but Sri Lankan Test star de Silva joined forces with
Mark Ealham to change the complexion of the game.
They put on a county-record for the sixth wicket of 315, with de
Silva's 225 -- made in 317 minutes off 273 balls and including
thirty-five 4s and two 6s -- bettering Dominic Ostler's 208 for
Warwickshire against Surrey in May.
Ealham, whose maiden first-class century came in 280 minutes off 264
balls, was still there at the close on 114.
''When you get on a wicket as good as this in such pleasant
surroundings, you really want to enjoy yourself, and that is what I
did,'' said de Silva.
In contrast, only three Yorkshire batsmen made double figures as Allan
Donald took five for 21 and Dougie Brown took four for 35. By the close,
the defending champions were 209 for four. Nick Knight made 91 and
Ostler 57.
Northamptonshire captain Allan Lamb is likely to be sidelined for two
weeks after cracking his right thumb, but the current leaders still
amassed 385 for four at home to Leicestershire. Lamb made 55 before
retiring hurt, Kevin Curran added 53, Russell Warren 75, and David Capel
an unbeaten 71.
Tony Cottey cracked 125 (205 balls and twenty 4s) as Glamorgan totted
up 422 for seven against Surrey. Hugh Morris added 51, Matthew Maynard
63, and Darren Thomas 50 not out. Scores:
At The Foster's Oval. Glamorgan 422-7 (P A Cottey 125, M P Maynard 63,
H Morris 51, S D Thomas 50no) v Surrey.
At Northampton. Northamptonshire 385-4 (R J Warren 75, D J Capel 71no,

Nottinghamshire.
At Old Trafford. Lancashire 322-4 (S P Titchard 96no, N J Speak 83, M

At Chester-Le-Street. Derbyshire 194 (K J Barnett 58; S J E Brown

Other match: At The Parks. Middlesex 303-7 dec and 167-1 dec (J C
Pooley 100no, D J Nash 50no); Oxford University 202 and 97-4. Match
drawn.
* SCOTLAND'S second string lost by 45 runs to India's young cricketers
at Titwood, Glasgow, yesterday.
After a stunning opening stand between stylish Ahmed Pagnis, who made
a century, and Narajan Godbole (61), Forfarshire's Bryce Robertson took
three wickets in five balls to help restrict the Star Club to 247 for
eight.
However, in reply the Scots collapsed from 89-1 after 25 overs, losing
their last seven wickets for just 52 runs. Scores:
Star Club 247-8 (A Pagnis 101, N Godbole 61; B Robertson 4-42);
Scotland B 202 (K Ritchie 67, B Lockie 39; R Morris 3-20, W D Balaji Rao
3-34).

PAUL Broadhurst hit out at Nick Faldo's talk of a European Tour
comfort zone after taking the first-round lead in the #550,000 Peugeot
French Open in Paris yesterday.
The 29-year-old from Warwickshire, whose career nosedived after he
played an unbeaten part in the 1991 Ryder Cup, took another step on the
road back with a five-under-par 67 on the windswept Golf National
course.
Broadhurst, who finished one ahead of Dane Anders Sorensen and two in
front of a group that contains the hobbling Jose Maria Olazabal, reckons
he has little chance of facing the Americans again this September. But
he wants it known he would love to.
Faldo spoke out last month about players not wanting to be superstars,
but Broadhurst vehemently disagrees.
''Comfort zone -- you must be joking,'' he said after grabbing eight
birdies in his round. ''Has he got a secret formula to become a
superstar? If he has, there are 140 players on this tour who would like
to know about it.
''I can't explain what's happened to myself, Peter Baker and Steve
Richardson. We would love to break through, but that's golf. It's hard
to get up there and I don't see how anybody can take a dig at us.''
Glasgow's Adam Hunter, currently No.27 in the Volvo Order of Merit,
was two off the pace after a 69 to be leading Scot, while Andrew
Oldcorn, winner last week in Jersey, shot 76 and then withdrew with a
bad back. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- P Broadhurst.
68 -- A Sorensen (Denmark).
69 -- A Hunter, L White, C Rocca (Italy), P Fulke (Sweden), J M
Olazabal (Spain).
70 -- G Turner (New Zealand), S Dodd, J Hawksworth, M Archer, M Farry
(France).
Other scores included: 74 -- G Brand Jr. 75 -- S Lyle. 76 -- A Oldcorn
(withdrew), S McAllister. 77 -- R Drummond, P Lawrie. 79 -- M Miller. 81
-- G Orr.
* HOLDER Craig Watson beat Gordon McKelvie by 5 and 4 in the first
round of the Claremont Scottish Mid Amateur championship yesterday at
Irvine. Results:
First round -- D Paton (Dunnikier Park) beat D Walker (Paisley), at
19th; W Bryson (Drumpellier) beat H Thomson (Irvine), 3 and 2; E Moir
(Hamilton) beat R Smith (Hamilton), 4 and 3; G Robertson (Irvine
Ravenspark) beat A Sharp (Portpatrick Dunskey), 3 and 2; M Robertson
(Selkirk) beat K Ross (Beith), 4 and 2; N Black (Kilmarnock Barassie)
beat C Rae (Greenock), 1 hole; A McEwan (Hamilton) beat M Moir
(Hamilton), 4 and 3; A Mathers (Elie) beat P McFarlane (Greenock), 2
holes; E Lindsay (Blairgowrie) beat J Johnston (Northumberland), 1 hole;
C Watson (East Renfrewshire) beat G McKelvie (Royal Troon), 5 and 4.
* GREG Norman, runner-up in last week's US Open, was three off the
pace after an opening 67 in the Greater Hartford Open in Connecticut.
Bob Estes and Kirk Triplett both equalled the course record to lead on
64 at the TPC River Highlands. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
64 -- B Estes, K Triplett.
65 -- D Stockton Jr.
66 -- J Cook, B Henninger, G Waite (New Zealand), E Aubrey.
67 -- G Norman (Australia), M Bradley, G Kraft, D Pooley, T Sills, D
Rummells, R Black, P Azinger, C Beck.
* DALE Reid and Myra McKinlay are expected to lead Scotland's
challenge for a #22,500 winner's cheque in the American Express 54-hole
European Masters which begins today at Cleydael in Antwerp. Both were
swamped in a glut of low scoring in Austria last week when 44 players
bettered par. Reid, one under, and McKinlay, two under, were among them.
* ANN Prentice of Bothwell Castle won the scratch prize with a
one-under-par 71 at the Lanarkshire Meeting at Cathkin Braes yesterday.
She also won the silver handicap prize with a net 67. Scores:
Silver. Scratch: 71 -- A Prentice (Bothwell Castle). Handicap: 67 --
Prentice (4). 68 -- E Smith (Kirkhill, 11). Bronze: Scratch: 90 -- O
Beverage (Sandyhills). Handicap: 71 -- Beverage (19). 74 -- R Gilzean

MERCHANT bankers Robert Fleming saw pre-tax profits decline in the
year to March by 18% to #172m with the depressed level of stock market
activity a major factor but is still the second best in the company's
history.
Despite the problem of Barings, Fleming has seen an increase in the
year in customer deposits of almost 9% to over #2520m, while shareholder
funds rose 13.6% to #694m and capital resources by 10.5% to #852m.
The dividend total has been raised from 16.7p to 20p per share.
The unquoted bank is owned by private individuals and certain
institutions and through its various funds is a substantial investor in
Caledonian Publishing, owners of The Herald.
Chairman Robin Fleming said that the year has been rather turbulent
with mixed fortunes for both markets and merchant banks alike. The
strategy is very much focused on equities and the international network
of offices in 34 countries.
He added that Fleming is unique in the financial world in seeking to
expand through joint ventures and doing so successfully with the Jardine
Fleming division bringing in an after-tax profit of $211m (#129m).
It has purchased a half-share in Martin &amp; Co's domestic equity
business in South Africa.
Chief executive John Manser said that despite unsettled conditions in
the investment trust, it was possible to expand the European Fledgeling
Smaller Company Trust and launch Fleming Indian Investment Trust which
is the first UK on-shore investment trust to specialise in that area.
Tokyo was the main reason for the increase in unit trust business with
funds under management rising by over $1000m to rank Jardine Matheson
the largest among foreign investment houses and twelfth domestically.
Global funds under management amounted to $78.5bn (#46.5bn). A
detailed breakdown shows that the UK contributed #79.4m of the pre-tax
total compared with #106m in 1993-94, Asia Pacific was effectively level
pegging while there was a fall from #22.8m to #12.1m in the US and
Europe.
Investment banking saw strong profits from mergers and acquisitions
and capital markets including advising the Wellcome Trust at the time of
the #9000m Glaxo takeover of Wellcome although over all there was a
decline from #121m to #95m.
The stockbroking side has over 400 salesman and 260 analysts -- the
investment management division saw its contribution fall from #88.4m to
#76.9m.

Travel can be exciting and can also be dangerous. Kirsty Scott reports
on the benefits of companies that make an extra effort to support
clients who find themselves in trouble abroad.
THE PHONE rang in Bronwyn Goldblyth's home shortly after 4.50am on
Saturday. It was bad news; a coach carrying 42 holidaymakers from
Turkey's Dalaman airport to their resort in Marmaris had collided with a
lorry and careered off the road less than an hour earlier. There were
injuries and fatalities.
Goldblyth, spokeswoman for Inspirations, the tour operator behind the
trip, made her way into the firm's Crawley headquarters where an
incident room had already been set up. The emergency procedure was well
underway with information lines established, and arrangements in hand to
get administration and medical personnel out to the scene as quickly as
possible, and the dead and injured brought home.
By Tuesday, the 29 survivors of the crash, and the bodies of the three
holidaymakers killed, were back in the UK. One woman, whose condition
deteriorated on the flight back, was diverted to Austria for treatment,
and eight holidaymakers who felt able to continue with their vacation
were being cared for and counselled at the resort.
It appeared to be a textbook response to a tour operator's nightmare,
but legally there had been absolutely no requirement for Inspirations to
lift a finger to help its customers.
UK regulations to protect holidaymakers concern themselves primarily
with cushioning the impact if a travel firm goes bust. There is also a
stipulation which makes travel firms liable for the negligent acts of a
third-party supplier -- say a drunk or incompetent coach driver -- but
nothing specifically to tie the tour operator to the unforeseen or
unavoidable.
''An awful lot of what we do is something we decided to do because we
have to, because you know it's the right thing for the client,'' said
Goldblyth yesterday. ''For the woman who was taken to Austria because
her condition deteriorated, we sent a member of our staff over there to
be with her. You don't have to do that, there is no legal obligation.
You do it because you know you must do it.
''You do it because you know it's the best thing for customer care.
That isn't PR hype. There are no rules in this type of incident. Every
holiday company has its own emergency procedures and they're written in
stone, so if anything should happen you can immediately swing into
action.''
Inspirations has not had to deal with anything as serious as the
Turkish tragedy but it has had its fair share of incidents, including
the inebriated young man who was arrested by Greek police after shinning
up a lamp-post. ''Every single type of emergency has to be dealt with,''
said Goldblyth.
''You have different incidents throughout the year, everything from
delays at airports to minor accidents, and major accidents where you
have to bring someone home. You know at the beginning of summer that
many more people will be travelling so these procedures need to be in
place.''
In the next few weeks, Inspirations will be assessing how it responded
to the coach crash, to see if the emergency action plan can be improved
or refined in any way. ''It did run extremely smoothly but we will be
reviewing the procedures in areas we thought weren't as tight as we
would want them . . . we will be learning from this experience.''
Shortly after the accident, some relatives were quoted as saying they
had not been contacted by the tour company to explain the circumstances
of the crash.
Across at the offices of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta), spokesman Alex Wallfall confirmed that legally Inspirations did
not have to act in the way it did.
''You're not legally obliged to bring people back to the UK, but
nine-and-a-half times out of 10 they will. It's very unlikely that a
tour operator in a situation similar to what happened in Turkey is going
to leave people there. We're not aware of it ever happening. It would be
such a stupid commercial thing for a tour operator to do. No Abta one
ever would.''
At the moment Abta has about 600 travel agents and tour operators on
its books and the Association of Independent Tour Operators has about
123, although there is some crossover between the two groups.
Abta has a code of conduct for its members which covers every aspect
of the holiday trade, from brochure descriptions to cancellations, and
the duty of care to customers.
As far as legal requirements go, Abta can only make recommendations
and point people in the direction of the Package Travel Regulations of
1992, which require anyone setting up as a tour operator to provide
financial security to customers by being bonded with another
organisation, holding a trust account or setting up an insurance policy.
The regulations also hold tour operators liable for the negligent
actions of a third-party contractor.
Wallfall said the rules have not proved infallible. Just last year a
coach operator in the north of England who was taking people down by bus
to Spain left one group stranded with no accommodation and no way back.
''They ended up with no hotel and they had to club together to get
enough money to get back to the UK. He said he had a trust account but
only 50p in it. The reason that there was no money in the account was
that it does not state in the Package Travel Regulations that the
managing director of a travel firm has to appoint an independent third
party trustee, so you can get the person who's running the business also
being the trustee.''
While such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, and while
most tour operators will respond to a crisis, Wallfall says it would be
rash to forego the safety net offered by travel insurance.
A recent study found that 38% of UK holidaymakers had travelled
overseas without insurance at some point, although 82% claimed they
regularly bought insurance when they were heading abroad.
Statistics like these trouble Wallfall, who uses one particularly
tragic tale as a caveat.
''There was a young guy last year who had just finished his finals at
university and he got a flight only to Greece where he went from Athens
to one of the Greek Islands. He got into a cab and when he got out at
the other end he was knocked over. They took him by air ambulance to
another island but he was dead on arrival.
''He didn't have any travel insurance and his family had to pay #4500
to get his body repatriated. The options were that he could be buried in
a pauper's grave in Greece or his body could be flown back. But he
didn't come back in a coffin. He was in a kind of make-shift wooden box.
''When people say: 'Do I really need insurance, what can possibly
happen to me in two weeks overseas?' they need to think about the
implications for their family. I know that family spent almost all their
savings repatriating his body. If you're prepared to spend #20 for 100
cigarettes or a bottle of whisky in Duty Free, why not spend the same
amount on insurance.''
Timetable
of tragedy
* 4am Saturday: coach carrying 42 holidaymakers from Dalaman airport
to the resort of Marmaris collides head-on with a lorry and careers off
the road into a nearby gully. Three people die and countless others are
injured.
* 4.50am: key officials with Inspirations headquarters in Crawley are
alerted by phone and an incident room is set up. Information line
established for worried relatives, and emergency procedures plan put in
motion.
* Mid-morning: Inspirations Operations director and a senior member of
staff are on their way to Turkey on the first flight, with a doctor and
a nurse. Plans set up to fly out relatives.
* Sunday morning: second doctor and nurse sent out by Inspirations
from UK. Arrangements made to fly the dead and injured home.
* Monday: member of Inspirations staff sent out from Crawley to
Austria to be with woman whose condition deteriorated as she was flown
home by air ambulance.
* Tuesday: the 29 crash survivors and bodies of the three dead are
flown back to Glasgow.

JURYS Hotel Group, the Irish owner of a three-star hotel in Glasgow,
made record profits last year and is launching a 15m punt (#14.7m)
rights issue to fund further expansion.
Jurys bought the 137-room Pond Hotel in Glasgow from the Stakis chain
in 1990 and renamed it the Jurys Glasgow Hotel last year.
Glasgow was Jurys' first step into the UK market.
Since then the Dublin-based group has spent #16m on buying two more
hotels in London and Bristol.
Managing director Peter Malone said Jurys was still looking for more
UK acquisitions, possibly in Birmingham, Manchester or Belfast.
''The peace dividend is very important for our business,'' he said.
The Glasgow hotel was contributing strongly to group profits with
occupancy rates of over 70%, but Mr Malone said the group was unlikely
to make a further purchase in Scotland for the foreseeable future.
''Everything in Edinburgh that is for sale or was for sale is very,
very expensive,'' he said.
Beyond the British Isles, Mr Malone said Jurys was looking at possible
acquisitions in Germany, Holland and Belgium.
The group announced a 62% increase in pre-tax profits to a record 6.2m
punts (#6.1m) in the year to April 30, with turnover up 23% at 41.3m
(#40.5m).
The full-year dividend was raised 12% to IR5.75p from IR5.15p, but
earnings per share streaked ahead by 44% to IR16p.
Jurys said all hotels in the group had increased their profit.

MANUFACTURERS faced less buoyant overall demand last month because of
weaker domestic orders, according to the latest CBI's monthly trends
survey.
Almost a quarter of companies said that their order books by volume
were above normal and 19% below normal, giving a positive balance of 5%.
This compares with 10% in the last survey, and is the least positive
result since last November.
The decline in demand was confined to the domestic market as overseas
demand continued to improve with the balance of 20% reporting
above-normal order books, the highest since 1977. The previous survey
had the balance at 17% and this time last year it was only 2%.
Sudhir Junankar, CBI associate director, economic analysis, commented:
''The manufacturing recovery seems to be slowing slightly, reflecting
weaker demand conditions in the home market. However, export demand
continues to rise, which should help to support the more moderate output
growth over the coming months.''
Firms still expect output to grow strongly over the next four months
but the pace will slow.
The outlook on inflation is positive. Although more firms expect to
increase prices than reduce them, the positive balance of 18% remained
the same as in the two previous months and well below the level of early
in the year.
In addition six out of ten see prices stable over the next four
months. The current level of finished goods is still thought to be more
than adequate to meet demand, though some restocking has taken place
lately.

THE banks selling their equity holdings in 3i received a keen price
for their shares, the stock being placed at 360p, a marginal discount on
the level of the shares in the market, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
The shares subsequently hardened 7p to 370p and the keen price shows
the strength of the institutional interest in the venture capital
specialist. The Bank of England and Lloyds disposed of their entire
holdings of 6.6% and 9% respectively.
In total 21% of the equity changed hands, realising #440m. Barclays
and Midland retained some of their shares, while Bank of Scotland and
NatWest did not participate in the placing, leaving their interests at
2.5% and 17.8% respectively.
Lloyds raised the most at #188m and together with its sale of a stake
in Standard Chartered earlier this year has over #300m to help pay for
its purchase of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
There is speculation that the bank is also interested in National &amp;
Provincial, though C&amp;G has caused its capital ratios to weaken and a
further big deal would probably mean a rights issue, which makes it less
likely.

DESPITE difficult market conditions Carpetright, chaired by Sir Philip
Harris, managed to report an impressive 40% hike in profits last year to
#19.7m before tax, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Sales grew by 28% to #141.3m although stripping out new store openings
growth was 4%. Forty-three new stores were opened during the year,
including the first shops in Northern Ireland, with a further 30 store
openings earmarked for the current year.
Trading was stronger in the second half and has begun satisfactorily
in the current financial year with like-for-like sales ahead of the
corresponding period last year. There is a final dividend of 6.6p a
share which, with the interim dividend of 3.9p, brings the total for the
year to 10.5p, a rise of 50%.
At the year-end the company had net cash of #20.2m. Mr Haris said that
with a strong balance sheet and an exciting year for store development
''the board looks forward with confidence to continued profitable
growth''.
The group sees scope to increase its market share from its current 12%
to 25% over the next five years.
News that the company may consider buying back its shares helped to
boost the price by 9p to 279p. Mr Harris said that the timing would
depend on whether the share price was at a level that would enhance
earnings per share.
The company intends to seek shareholder approval to repurchase its
shares at its annual general meeting next month.

* THE case of Ferrier v. Edinburgh District Council may not be on
everyone's lips today. But if you live in a listed building, it's worth
noting.
Miss Ferrier spent #2000 taking planners all the way to a public
inquiry after she removed a bedroom fireplace from a Victorian flat with
''no outstanding architectural merit''. She challenged the official view
that the overall character of the tenement building had been diminished
-- she also believed listed building consent was needed only for outdoor
alterations. The Scottish Office reporter who heard her appeal has just
ruled in favour of the council, and Miss Ferrier has six months to
replace the fireplace. Edinburgh publishes a free guide Under Your Own

ELIZABETH WESTCOTT reports on how the latest food magazines offer a
well-chosen mix of recipes, handy tips, and sound food advice.
FOOD is in fashion in Britain. The land that gave the chip to world
cuisine, is developing broader culinary aspirations, and for the
consumer this has resulted in a dazzling gallery of food-oriented
products, not the least of which is the food magazine.
In a market saturated with cookbooks, television cooking programmes,
and lengthy food sections in Sunday newspapers, food magazines are
marketing themselves carefully to give the broadest possible appeal.
Gone are the gourmet magazines like Taste and A la Carte, and in their
place are publications linked to household names, like Sainsbury's, the
BBC and Jane Asher. The formula tends to be a well-chosen blend of easy
and more complicated recipes, a splash of wine and articles on food,
mixed with a few other ingredients like fashion, beauty, travel and
celebrities.
BBC Good Food:
Price: #1.45
Circulation: 438,715
Issued: monthly
* DEFINITELY the queen of food magazines, BBC Good Food gives the
feeling of opening up a whole world of food, with consumer news,
promotions of new products, articles on topical food issues and even
Good Food holidays.
The recipes cater for people with basic skills (the Meals in Minutes
section even comes with a ready-made shopping list) and there are more
complicated menus for home chefs. The close links with BBC programmes
like Masterchef and Ready, Steady, Cook introduce the extra interest of
TV personalities, but surprisingly don't dominate the magazine. Useful
information like cooking times, freezing tips, and a recipe index and be
found on the back.
Criticisms: The heavy inclusion of advertorial means it is sometimes
hard to distinguish between the ads and genuine food articles.
BBC Vegetarian Good Food
Price: #1.65
Circulation: 70,500
Issued: monthly
* THIS started as a supplement to Good Food in 1992, graduating from
quarterly to bi-monthly then monthly as its popularity grew. As with
Good Food, it is presented in a sophisticated, glossy format.
Full of invaluable information for vegetarians (such as the humorously
titled Veggies on Tour, a guide to meatless eating abroad). The magazine
emphasises the delights of eating vegetables and seeks to combat the
negative image of vegetarianism.
The message is summed up by Ursula Ferrigno, a chef featured in the
July issue: ''Vegetarianism isn't about health, it's about eating good,
tasty food that doesn't contain meat.''
Criticisms: None.
Jane Asher's Magazine
Price: #1.60
Circulation: 195,000
Issued: quarterly
* WHILE food is the driving force of this magazine, there's a generous
dollop of crafts as well. According to publisher Rolf Paltzer, Jane
Asher was approached for a one-off Christmas special because of her
association with cookery and cakes, and her ''squeaky-clean''
middle-class image. Their initial success prompted a quarterly
follow-up; the summer edition is the third issue.
The feeling is one of a whole lifestyle, with a strong emphasis on
entertaining and cultivating home-oriented skills, and flavoured with
Jane's chatty, first person style. (''What memory do you have of me
working on Brideshead,'' I asked the suave and dishy Jeremy Irons.)
Criticisms: Only works if the reader can relate to the character of
Jane, who frequently pops up wearing different floral dresses, knitting
jerseys, and drinking cocktails.
Healthy Eating
Price: #1.80
Circulation: 25,000
Issued: monthly
* THIS magazine was the most educational in terms of food knowledge,
but its low circulation is testimony to the lack of promotional sparkle
that distinguishes the others. Assistant editor Angela August says it
began as ''a niche magazine full of vitamins and minerals for
greenies.''
It has since moved more into the mainstream, although it still has a
slightly niche feel. Fat-buster recipes and health-oriented articles on
obesity and pre-pregnancy nutrition, along with a health quiz and an
article on Catherine Zeta Jones feature in the June issue, which comes
with a useful acid counter attached.
The food news section is full of pertinent snippets of information.
Especially interesting is an article on wartime beauty tricks from the
kitchen cupboard, like the creamy, soothing bran bath.
Criticisms: None.
Sainsbury's: The Magazine
Price: 95p
Circulation: 312,000
Issued: monthly
* THIS chubby, glossy manual is probably the best value for money,
with 200 pages for 95p. The magazine was inspired by Sainsbury's food
consultant Delia Smith, as a way of communicating to customers about the
range of interesting products available. Consequently the recipes are
influenced by Delia's ethos of cooking from the home-cook's point of
view: with restricted space, money and time.
Step-by-step guides allow even those with limited skills to make choux
pastry. With the ''Take One'' recipes based on one ingredient, like
pancake mix (from Sainsbury's, of course) you can whip up a fabulous
meal in 20 minutes.
Articles on fashion, celebrities, homes, travel, even popular
psychology play a much greater role in this magazine than the others.
While there is the strong link to Sainsbury's, editorial independence
has made for a more general feel to the magazine than might be expected.
Criticisms: Only available from Sainsbury's supermarkets.

DID you know it was Anti-Angling Week? Probably not; the 300-odd
people who actively defend the rights of fish haven't got the PR clout
of Greenpeace or the funds for derring-do helicopter drops in the ocean.
But they do do drops in the lake, plunging into Britain's freshwaters to
disrupt angling competitions.
In a country where the notion of honourable protest becomes
increasingly adulterated by the clowning of daft demonstrators, are
there any antics more ludicrous than the splashing of a wally in a wet
suit waist-deep in water, trying to scare the bream? Maybe.
What about the antics of the Labour Party, which has chosen
Anti-Angling Week to launch its pro-angling policy? Is this mischief or
is this mismanagement? Whatever the roguish or incompetent nature of the
timing, Labour's sporting position on the moral acceptability of angling
will cause few ripples on the waters of its policies, most of which are
still cloudy. Fish are a soft target; not only is angling the country's
most popular participation sport, but the right to cast and reel is a
little easier to deliver than the right to on-the-spot hip replacements
or an equitable education system.
You have to feel pity for the tiny, crazed forces of the anti-angling
lobby. While other animal rights activists see a meagre advance of their
cause in the new Euro-arrangements for the transport of livestock, the
fish rights campaigners -- not to be confused with fishing rights
campaigners -- have been dumped by the party which formally declares its
opposition to blood sports. The trout carp, meanwhile, and ask . . . if
you hook me do I not bleed? As I understand Labour's logic on this
inquiry angling is not a blood sport for two reasons: the scientific
data on whether fish ''feel pain in the sense that mammals do'' is
inconclusive, and as long as people go on eating fish the people's party
can't reasonably object to catching and killing them.
Crusty old cynics like myself might extend this logic to include the
class equations which are made between blood sports like fox-hunting and
its followers and blood sports like angling and its fans. In Scotland
the popular perception of angling is distorted by the exclusive
distinction of our great fishing rivers, the elite salmon beats of Spey
and Tay, but nationwide fishing is the humblest of sports. If needs must
the pursuer of perch on the Midlands canal can fund his hobby from
unemployment benefit.
This is the constituency Labour would offend if it proscribed angling.
Besides which, the fish has the wrong profile; the fish can never meet
our eyes, only our eye. The correlation between human sympathy for
animals and the ''human'' appearance of animals (notably those with eyes
at the front of their heads) works against the fish, which regardless of
species always looks inhuman. That said, I have stared into the eye of a
newly-landed jackfish and felt shifty.
Early in life you learn where your sympathies lie: with the hunter or
the hunted. Fishing -- I wouldn't glamourise my efforts with the expert
resonance of the word angling -- is the only blood sport with which I've
ever flirted. When I was nine I fished off the old pier at North Berwick
and felt so sorry for the wriggling sprats I threw them back.
When I was twentysomething I fished on a lake in Saskatchewan and felt
so sorry for the shocked trout I threw them back; when I was
thirtysomething I fished for mackerel from a yacht in the Minch . . .
and threw them back; and two years ago I caught a beefy jackfish from a
dinghy in the Java Sea. Before I could throw it back, our Indonesian
helmsman thumped it on the head. Baked in ginger it tasted wonderful.
I have the appetite for eating all manner of things but not the
appetite for hunting them. Even fish. But I like the idea of angling,
its elemental nature, the single contest of fisher and fish, the deft
choreography of the fly-fisher's cast; and I consider the angler an
ornament to the countryside.
The boy at the edge of the muddy mere with his jar of bait . . . the
elegant artist thigh-deep in water, wafting her wand with its pretty
lures . . . each touches the landscape lightly, enhancing its scale,
diminishing their own with the contribution of their patient craft. The
angler on the riverbank or the riverbed and the fish in the water become
''interactive'' beyond the genius of cybernetics.
The most popular participation sport in Britain has, thank heavens,
nothing to do with today's leisure industry and its restless buzzing
after newer and noisier ways of ruining the countryside, its fractious
jet bikes and lunatic war games. Anglers have ancient skills. They are
there in the history of art and the best books: The Old Man and the Sea
and his mighty marlin, the epic salmon-struggle in John Macnab.
They are there with the contradictions of their kind: ''Then he was
sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination
to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him . . . You are killing
me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I
seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than
you, brother . . .''
Early in March, from a comfortable room in a Perthshire hotel, I
watched three fishers on the Tay. Their skiff hung in the water at the
bottom of the garden and the angle of the lawn made the Tay, the most
handsome of Scotland's rivers, look fathomless. As I read and lounged I
glanced up from time to time and the fishers were still there, peaceful
silhouettes in a painterly light.
Drizzle fell. I made some tea and took a bath, and they were still
there. Dusk fell. The drizzle turned to sleet and they were still there.
I read some more and changed for dinner and they were still there,
visible only by the ghostly lining of snow on their waxed jackets.
The next time I went to the window it was morning and, of course, they
were gone. The river looked beautiful but vacant. At a loose end.
I don't much care if the Labour Party's policy on angling is rooted in
the politics of appeasement, or if they don't know when to call a blood
sport a blood sport. I'm just glad they're leaving fishers alone with
their solitary rapture and graceful calm.

IT WAS the leggy and blonde Kirsten McAlonan of the Scottish
Exhibition Centre thingmy who invited me off to the place. It was host
to The Clothes Show. It was great. They gave me lunch, Robert Eynon and
Kirsten McAlonan. D'you know the thing which I was most pleased about? I
got their names right. After that I didn't really give much of a rat's
arse: I was too busy looking at girls. You should see Clothes Shows.
Last weekend I discovered in a bathroom scales that I am over 12 stone.
On Tuesday I discovered I am better off. Most of the girls who were
modelling clothes weighed enough for bit-parts in Hammer films -- the
corpses. When I was a little boy I was wont to delight in removing the
panties from my girl cousin's dolls. Few of these model girls could have
their bums filling the mannequins' pants they were that tiny. But there
were those girls there who most certainly could. You should have seen
the Irish Show. Oh, Sweet God, you should. There were girls on display
which made your blood sugar turn into jam.
I started this column up out of a wee bit of badness: to upset the wee
lemon curds, the bints, the lassies, the girls, the women. But let us go
back to the clothes. Because they were lovely. The entire clothes' event
was smashing, with lots of stalls and catwalks and clothes and really
nice people and models and clothes and male models as handsome as Clark
Gable and Scarlett O'Hara being the legend and lots of girls and
clothes. And a lot of clothes at that because that is what this show was
all about.
It was grand. So was the Scottish Exhibition place. I have written
scurvily of the hotel which is next to it and with some reason but this
huge venue, regarded at first as a bit of a White Elephantine spot of
sub-East European watch-chain socialist visual rhetoric. But it wasn't
like that at all. It was about clothes. And here you are then; I admit
it. This column is a bit girlie even. I love clothes and I love dressing
up in them and always did: you should see me in a kilt. In a kilt? Ask
the lads when I am in one. My Highland dress is the full trip. The
velvet doublet with the lace cuffs and jabot: I would pass for a Scots
barrister in London with a drink in him, ready for the jile. The old
black dagger, the sgian dubh in the sock, the brogues tied, the Y-fronts
underneath (a wee aside: if you are circumcised a kilt isnae too easy
without drachars), the full trip, the entire Highland razzymagoo.
Now here you are. I am into clothes. Back when but a boy I had the
drape jaicket and the drainpipe strides. Later it was the Eyetalian suit
with the stripes and the cloth buttons. Starched collars and cuff links
large enough to halt the QE2 in bad weather. I spent years unable to sit
down in case the troosers got a wrinkle in the knees. My shoes were
winklepickered enough to pass for an implement for a pearl-fisher. I
loved clothes. And over the years I still find myself drawn to them. My
clothes. Other people's clothes. Even ladies' clothes.
Few men actually have the slightest idea of women and clothes. I mean,
they know women put them on. Some of them know they take them off. But
few men have the slightest scooby about what clothes mean to women. Some
women anyway. The past few years has seen a large number of young women
who clearly have the sort of dress sense which would pass for a wardress
mistress in Ben Hur, the scene for the leprosy victims. Cell Block H is
the very style. Dear heavens, there are people in The Herald who model
themselves on the harridans. That's the blokes on the sports desks,
editors and the like who sport haircuts which would make Magwitch look
like Dolly Parton. This is quite a complicated simile but youse will
just have to work it out.
Clothes maketh not the man and all that but they maketh a wee bit of
an idea of what you are like. The number of female journos I have known
who are actually tidy can be numbered on one of my perfectly manicured
mitts but male journalists would drive you to drink. Well it did me
anyway. One of the editors for whom I worked was wont to sport Chester
Barrie suits worth a fortune and then obviously paid a minion to sleep
in it for a week. The current editor dresses in a style which suggests
he wants a job as next President of Serbia. I have a brother who dresses
up enough to imply that it would be a fitting end if the Sicilian Mafia
came over and shot him in an Italian restaurant. The girls in marketing
in The Herald wear gear which Joan Collins can't afford and the women in
the journalist bits dress like something out of East Berlin in 1946.
Ach I'm glad I got all this out: a bit of all-round abuse. Clothes do
maketh the man. Did you see the claes Major wore? He had to go. Me next
for office. You should see my white shoes.

JUST at the point when it seemed to be escalating with hostage-taking
raids into Russia, the war in Chechnya may be within sight of ending
through negotiation. Ironically, the first dramatic raid on a Russian
town north of Chechnya, which left 120 people dead, never mind the
hostages, may have provided the catalyst, although officially the
Chechens have condemned it and threatened to hand its leader over to the
Russian authorities. Local sources, however, insisted that another four
such raids had been planned. Their proliferation would have produced an
even more intense dimension of bitterness, and the possibility of
equally savage Russian retaliation could not have been ruled out.
The negotiators, under the auspices of the Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe, managed to achieve concessions from both
sides whose previous positions had been irreconcilable. The Chechens had
wanted outright independence and the immediate withdrawal of all Russian
forces as a prior condition of peace talks, the Russians were insisting
instead on the complete integration of Chechnya with Russia. Now the two
sides are settling for less. The Russians will start withdrawing some of
their troops and in response Chechen forces will lay down their arms.
That last agreement may not be accepted by Chechen forces in the
Caucasus Mountains, but if the main body of Chechen fighters accepts the
leadership of its own members of the negotiating team, bitter-enders
will be marginalised, although they may continue to be a serious
nuisance for some time.
The war has gone on for some six months and has claimed thousands of
lives as well as bringing about the destruction of many Chechen towns,
including the capital Grozny. It was hard to see it ever being won by
the Chechens, a small people, unless the Russians were divided or became
convinced that the cost of maintaining Chechnya was too high. Signs of
division in Russian political circles did emerge when the fighting
started, but those groups opposing the use of force proved to be
ineffective, and questions of cost were offset by calculations about the
number of other distinct peoples in semi-autonomous regions who might
also opt for independence. The Russian Army did not conduct operations
with any distinction, but that merely seemed to reinforce President
Yeltsin's commitment to the use of force.
In some ways Mr Yeltsin may not profit from the peace. In particular,
he lost public support when he preferred to attend the G7 conference in
Canada rather than deal with the Chechen raid on the town of Buddenovsk.
That decision was massively unpopular. His Prime Minister, Mr
Chernomyrdin, dealt with the kidnappers so successfully that he boosted
his personal standing to a remarkable degree. These developments are
bound to have an effect on the Russian presidential election which takes
place next year. Mr Yeltsin's re-election has never been able to be
taken for granted but his most powerful opponent was thought to be Mr
Zhirinovsky, the extreme Nationalist. The war in Chechnya may have
changed that by promoting Mr Chernomyrdin's party.

<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY generator Manweb has posted a 22% increase in dividends to
29.8p for the year to March, after a final of 20p.
Profits before exceptional items rose 11% to #140m. Exceptionals came
to #54m, including #16m related to withdrawal from electrical retailing.
Now the group is concentrating on its core business, though it will
carry on with other non-regulated activities, particularly in the gas
industry as it opens up to full competition over the next two years.
Manweb Gas, a joint venture with Alliance Gas, made a small profit in
the year. The group earned #800,000 from its Welsh wind farm.
Chief executive John Roberts indicated they would wait for the result
of next month's review of electricity prices by industry regulator
Professor Stephen Littlechild before revealing their plans to reward
shareholders and customers for efficiency savings.
With the retail side now gone he sees savings of #25m a year being
achieved to 1997. Last year overheads fell by 7.3% in real terms. Manweb
shares gained 12p to 679p.

<HEADLINE>Crash in new life business TSB results clouded by unit trust sales</HEADLINE>

TSB'S strength and what distinguishes it substantially from the rest
of the pack in the High Street is its concentration on insurance,
encapsulated in that rather strange and foreign-looking word
bancassurance.
So at first sight the crash in new life business and unit trust sales
looks somewhat disturbing with a decline from #562m to #227m of which
the unit trust activities were responsible for #240m of the setback.
They raise the question as to whether TSB will have to acquire to give
itself more momentum with chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison saying that it
may buy a building society.
Certainly it does have the balance sheet strength and its past series
of acquisitions which have more than wiped out the proceeds from the
original float will have imbued it with prudence.
The life and unit trust problems overshadowed a generally stable set
of interim results which showed the bank's pre-tax profit had increased
20% to #271m even if the core retail banking activities were just #3m
better at #108m after allowing for the #17m profit on the sale of gilts.
The bad-debt charge fell #44m to just #67m.
The half-time dividend has been raised 16% to 4.111p but the shares
responded by falling 3[1/2]p to 249[1/2]p.
TSB has inevitably participated in the general downturn in the life
and unit trust sector where public uncertainty over the scandals of
mis-selling by certain operators have left a nasty taste that seems
unlikely to go away for quite some time. Fortunately the #38m of
provisions originally set aside to cover any liabilities seems to be
more than adequate.
At the same time TSB has launched new savings products which meant
re-training some 2300 staff to provide a much more comprehensive service
to customers and established a new remuneration system. That has
resulted in the top 10% of commission earners moving elsewhere as well
as fewer people actively selling in the early months of 1995.
On Wednesday, NatWest Life had said it was creating 500 redundancies
among its 2500 employees in the life sector which only underlines the
problems in the sector where any substantial upturn can come only from a
sharp rise in house prices and less trepidation over employment.
However, the general insurance side has come to the rescue at TSB so
that overall divisional profits were 7% ahead at #91m and within
shouting distance of retail banking.
That saw flat net interest income with the increase in lending offset
by narrower margins. The mortgage book rose 7.7% against an industry
increase of just 2[1/2]% to raise its overall market share to 2%. Other
lending was ahead by just 3.3% with TSB still to make any real impact in
commercial lending from its own book. But given the economic climate, it
is pretty difficult to expand against the general level of competition
and overall company liquidity not under any pressure.
The bad-debt position was helped by further improvements in both the
Loan Administration Unit which took over the dud Hill Samuel loans in
October 1992 with the outstandings down during the intervening period
from #975m to #301m and in Mortgage Express.
Hill Samuel overall should be patting itself on the back with a mere
7.5% profits slip to #49m compared with the havoc being seen elsewhere
in the sector. The profits fall was due to a dull period in corporate
business for the merchant banking activities -- and expansion here is
also a possibility in what chief executive Peter Ellwood describes as
being a core activity and very much part of the TSB.
The problems of Barings and the flight to security has had little
significant impact upon the level of TSB's deposits.
Full-year profits look like rising from #504m to about #575m which
would leave the shares trading at 10 times likely earnings and yielding
5[1/4]% on a possible 10.5p dividend total. There seems little to go for
until there are more positive signs on the life and unit trust
operations.

MORE prawns were devoured over lunch in Edinburgh yesterday, as the
Labour Party's offensive to convince business it has shed its forked
tail and is listening to industry's concerns in developing policy moved
up a gear in Scotland.
There was a big emphasis on what impact Labour's plans for a Scottish
parliament might have on the business community. But the most striking
feature of the launch of the Scottish Industry Forum, which heard from
Jack Cunningham and George Robertson from Labour's Shadow Cabinet and
from John Ward, chairman of CBI Scotland, was the near consensus in the
diagnosis of the roots and causes of Britain's post-war industrial
decline.
There wasn't the thickness of a prawn shell between the analysis,
repeated yesterday, which Ward has been delivering the length and
breadth of Scotland in recent months to pump momentum into the CBI's
business agenda initiative, and Cunningham's own assessment of our
economic predicament.
Labour's Shadow trade and industry spokesman takes as his starting
point 1979. Well, he would, wouldn't he? That way he can blame it all on
Thatcher. John Ward's evidence goes back to 1960 and, on some of the key
measures, to 1900. But the charge sheets the two men have drawn up are
virtually interchangeable.
Long-term, our average rate of growth is poor. The lowest among the
Group of Seven nations since 1979, says Cunningham. Under 1% a year
since 1960, says Ward. Our investment record is abysmal. We are still
investing 17% less today in manufacturing industry than we did in 1979,
says Cunningham. We invest 14% of GDP, the Japanese invest 30%, the
emerging tigers invest 35%, says Ward.
These two trends -- weak investment, indifferent growth -- are
intimately and causally connected. That connection was graphically
illustrated on the latest edition of Sir John Harvey-Jones's
Troubleshooter series this week, when the former ICI chairman visited an
engineering sub-contractor in Bolton who claimed to be one of the best
in the land.
''I've watched your earlier programmes. I've taken your lessons on
board. I think I'm doing everything else right, how can I make more
money?'' the owner inquired of his illustrious troubleshooter. But the
first machine they stopped at turned out to be an antique Herbert
machine tool, purchased 12 years before for #150, which had run ever
since.
There followed a familiar Harvey-Jones refrain. If you want to compete
on quality, on cost, and on delivery, scrap these antiques and invest,
invest, invest in the latest kit. That's what the competition is doing.
That's the only way to boost productivity to internationally competitive
levels.
He's right of course. And the fact that he'd just come from the
revived Triumph motorcycle factory, where a patient, committed owner
with very deep pockets has invested #70m and is only now getting a
profit back from the business, rendered the warning the more messianic.
But for those, like our Bolton sub-contractor, who have shallower
pockets, there's a fundamental problem on which, again, Cunningham and
Ward agree. Typical investment horizons in this country are woefully
short. Investors are usually looking for a pay-back within two to four
years, says Ward, compared with 10 to 12 years in Japan.
Both men also agree that investment in the skills of many of our
people is half-hearted. ''Out of 41 countries surveyed in the World
Competitiveness Report, Britain ranked 32nd for our in-company training
and 37th for the ability of our education system to meet the needs of a
competitive economy,'' says Cunningham.
''In my industry,'' says Ward, who has spent 30 years with IBM,
''there are now more graduates in India than there are people in the UK.
Some of them write outstanding software. And they are happy to do it on
a salary of $1500 a year.''
We could go on. The analysis which emerges is stark. Britain has
tumbled down the international competitiveness league over decades,
under governments of both major parties. The big question now is whether
governments of any colour have it in their power to arrest that trend
and repair some of the damage.
Labour, of course, insists that it can devise policies which will help
deliver that new industrial revolution. Some of the leading Scottish
business people attending yesterday's forum are yet to be convinced. ''I
haven't heard anything today which will change the present short-termist
culture,'' one told me. John Ward put the same point succinctly: ''Until
we change the psyche, any policy we might put in place is going to be
thwarted.''
There are signs that Labour leader Tony Blair recognises the true
scale of the challenge. In a speech last week to an equivalent forum
meeting in London he said: ''There is no simple explanation for
Britain's weakness in the past, nor a single policy which will rectify
it. To achieve greater competitiveness and stronger economic performance
we will need to improve our performance across a whole range of
matters.''
There are, of course, underlying economic conditions which any
incoming government must aspire to, if we are to have any hope of
breaking the dispiriting pattern of the past. The word on everyone's
lips is stability. And two of the keys to that economic stability are
subdued inflation, low real interest rates, and relatively predictable
exchange rates.
But, to achieve all that, Labour will have to be as tough, if not
tougher, on new public spending commitments as the Tories keep saying
they intend to be. Members of Labour's Treasury team now sit on every
policy committee the party has to ensure no new spending commitments
creep unnoticed on to the agenda.
But, for a party whose whole history has been about using more public
resources for the wider public good and whose traditional ethos has been
instinctively redistributivist, keeping a tight lid on its own spending
commitments in pursuit of new ways of reviving wealth creation in this
country is bound to prove a tense and potentially disruptive challenge.
Turning the tide of the past 50 years is an awesome agenda.

Brussels
AN Italian judge has impounded the assets of a university where a
Scottish lecturer complains he is the victim of illegal job
discrimination.
Professor David Petrie, 43-year-old professor of languages and
literature at the University of Verona, has suffered substantial cuts in
wages and conditions along with 13 other foreigners while their Italian
colleagues have received pay rises and promotion.
By impounding the assets of the university, the Italian court intends
to secure wages and back payments of #21,000 for the foreigners while a
final settlement is sought in the long-running dispute.
The case has already led to a series of judgments in the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg in favour of the foreign lecturers.
However, the university has ignored them.
The European Commission in Brussels has also taken out infringement
proceedings against the Italian Government for permitting continued
defiance of European law, which states that there must be no
discrimination on the basis of nationality. This could mean the case
going back to the Court of Justice.
The commission is also considering a request from Mr Hugh McMahon,
Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde West, for cuts in EU educational aid to
Italy if the case is not resolved in favour of the lecturers. Professor
Petrie comes from Dumbarton, in Mr McMahon's constituency.
Mr McMahon said yesterday: ''It speaks volumes for the state of
affairs at Verona University when non-Italian lecturers have to resort
to court interdicts to receive their pay.
''The university is continuing to flout EU law by discriminating
against foreign lecturers in terms of pay and conditions.''
The lecturers were outraged earlier this year when they were told
their salaries would be cut by 15%. They were then ordered into smaller
offices. The university also attempted to reclassify the lecturers as
laboratory assistants so that the wage cuts could be justified,
Professor Petrie said.

WELL, it had to have been one of the most unusual finishes to the St
Magnus Festival. Last year, admittedly, the organisers managed to get
something like 500 children onstage to celebrate the birthday of
festival founder, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. This year, the closing
concert featured a mere 125 children -- a large choir and a string
orchestra. But then they got to play and sing a new composition with
Capercaillie, which probably amounts to the experience of a lifetime for
all 125 children.
The occasion was the premiere of a new work written for the
combination by Steve King, SCO violist, composer, and educational
expert. Entitled Farewell, it's a four-section piece that featured all
the resources in different combinations. Cleverly written, the piece
employs simple and colourful materials that are assembled into effective
patterns.
Initially the choir vocalises wordlessly, with the unmistakably
evocative Capercaillie washes of colour, and Karen Matheson's vocals,
added later. The music goes through a big-beat phase before the fiddle
orchestra has a dance section to itself.
Threaded throughout this, the story of the singer who leaves home to
make her name in the big city is touchingly depicted, especially in the
closing section where, when the kids join with Capercaillie in the
refrain, it becomes quite poignant and moving. A lovely wee piece in the
middle of a stomping, atmospheric, sell-out concert by the folk
supergroup.

HALF the Herald staff has departed for Spain, it seems, including El
Tam, the usual occupier of this space. Messrs Shields and Co follow in
the footsteps of a celebrated namesake, Christopher Holme of Reuters,
the first journalist to report the bombing of Guernica by German
aircraft in 1937, for which deed Franco wanted him shot.
Hitler was none too keen on him either, so when the Nazis marched into
Austria the following year, Holme high-tailed off to Switzerland with
his half-Jewish assistant hidden in the boot of the Lagonda he'd bought
with his wages in Spain. A good job too for Reuters: the chap in the
boot was Alfred Geiringer, who after the war set up its financial
services section which has kept the news agency going at a profit ever
since.
Far be it for me to stretch a point, but the clear moral of this story
is: pay journalists in the front line lots of money and expenses and
don't begrudge them a fancy car. Even if they don't drive.
Black marks
IT SEEMS the youngsters in Carron Primary at Falkirk can teach Her
Majesty's Inspectors a thing or two about spelling. In their report on
the school, the officials noted senior classes took trouble over
presenting and punctuating their work accurately. Which is more than
they did in referring to themselves as HM Inspectors of Schooll.
Nurse's suffering
COMMUNITY psychiatric nurse Martha McLachlan has just been awarded
#500 by an industrial tribunal against Central Scotland Health Care NHS
Trust after it tried to shift her to another team. What made it unusual
were the grounds for her successful case: sexual discrimination because
she was a woman. Even in nursing, it appears, you suffer if you are
female, work part-time, and are about to go on maternity leave.
Hitting the sauce
AND for those who don't fancy sinking all those pints before heading
for a curry, a Sussex brewery is now marketing Tandoori Special, which
it claims tastes exactly like Chicken Tandoori. Sounds pretty awful, but
apparently it is going down well among the punters at the Three Judges
in Partick. An added advantage is that it should avoid all those carrots
and tomato skins in the chunder.
Rugby racists
IN THE wake of the defeat by New Zealand maybe England should change
their brewing sponsor from Courage to Carling Black Label.
As Ian ''Stinker'' Bell has already noted in this diary, it was
strange to hear the worst manifestation of World Cup racialist rumblings
coming from the English camp rather than Mr and Mrs van der
Kaffirbasher.
Captain Will's reference to Jonah Lomu as a freak (an abnormal
production of nature or monstrosity) was distasteful and the subtext
picked up by the press was that the South Auckland bank clerk was tinted
with the Tongan tar brush.
But there are hundreds of 18-stone heavies in club rugby, most of them
with much uglier mugs than Lomu, whose only offence it seems, was to
play quite well on the wing rather than in the scrum. Beating the
England XV single-handed was the easy bit. He also had to overcome the
complete and undivided attention of the Prime Minister. Oh Yes!
* MR LOMU could, of course, sue for defamation. No shortage of lawyers
to consult in the final: Francois Pineaar the Springboks captain or even
State President Mandela. It's unlikely that he would choose that nice
chap Brian Moore whom he met fleetingly last Sunday.
Jean-Jock alliance
BRIAN is not the personal favourite of Jean-Claude Richard, our French
Consul General. Something about friendly scrummaging banter in an
international four years ago which led to two peace-loving French
players being sent off.
Jean-Claude, the only public figure in recent times to have three
pictures of himself on the same Herald front page, is off to a new
posting in Tashkent. It could have been worse . . . Australia or New
Zealand.
There was a farewell bash for him and his wife Charlotte last night,
but he is already immortalised for all the prizes he has secured for our
competition to find the best tales from the 700 years of the Jean-Jock
alliance.
Keep the entries coming, maybe along the lines of the world's worst
bodyguard, Gabriel Montgomery. He was a member of the Garde Ecossaise in
1539 with the job of protecting King Henri II, but ended up killing him
in a joust by sticking his lance in the royal temple. Gab the Gubber
was, perhaps surprisingly, not instantly despatched himself. He retired
to his estates in Normandy and lived another 36 years before finally
being executed for picking the wrong side in the French Wars of
Religion.
One tot too many
THE launch of Labour's campaign against rail privatisation went
slightly off track in Edinburgh when it referred to Waverly station.
Just don't tell Sir Walter Scott. On the same lines, brewers McEwan's
say their hospitality venue for the Tall Ships Race is at the Corn
Exchange in Leith, built on an old navel yard. Probably full of
discharged seamen, as the old salts' saying used to have it.

FORMER champion showjumper Harvey Smith yesterday refused to answer
questions at an inquest into the deaths of three people in a road crash.
Mr Smith, 56, of High Eldwick, near Bingley, West Yorkshire, chose the
right not to say anything that would incriminate him.
Accident verdicts were recorded at the Harrogate inquest on the
victims of the crash which involved Mr Smith's horse box and a Ford
Escort.
Mr Smith, who has already been told he does not face police
prosecution, would only confirm that he was driving the horse box at the
time.
The inquest heard that driver Andrew Gowland, 30, and passengers Gary
Hayton, 31, and Ernest Larvin, 37, died instantly when their car
ploughed into the rear of the horse box.
Mr Larvin's six-year-old son Daniel suffered serious injuries and
student Andy Fulcher, 17, escaped with cuts.
The accident in January happened on the main York to Harrogate road at
Allerton Park after Mr Smith's horse transporter emerged from a slip
road.
Coroner Sidney Jacobs, recording the accident verdicts, said: ''It is
not my role to apportion blame but the verdicts do not mean no-one is to
blame.''
He said there was no suggestion Mr Gowland drove dangerously.
After the inquest, Mr Gowland's father Frank said: ''Without Harvey
Smith's evidence, nobody can really say exactly what happened. I would
have very much liked to have heard his version of the events but, as he
was entitled, he chose not to do this.''

David Belcher runs to earth the trio behind the T In The Park festival
THIS year as last, Scotland's major outdoor festival, T In The Park,
is being assembled from a fittingly rustic base -- a converted
stable-block in green and pleasant Stirlingshire home of DF Concerts
(DFC), the event's promoters, as well as being the hub of a business
which buses fans to shows nationwide, and operates Scotland's premier
pub-sized venue, King Tut's.
In this pastoral splendour, DFC's small herd of golden labradors
gambol as fax-machines chatter, and phone-lines transmit talk of riders,
running-orders, and serious moolah to hard-bitten rockbiz managers
around the globe. But who's this cove with no socks on?
And no fat cigar. No greasy homburg. It's DFC supremo Stuart Clumpas,
and he wants to set the record straight.
''Here he goes, the thoughts of Chairman Clump . . . but it bugs me
that folk think promoters make millions when actually we work on small
margins, the final 3-4% of a gig's total cost, which is usually hundreds
of pounds, not thousands. So yeah, T In The Park nearly washed its face
last year, but not quite . . . although the loss was small enough for me
to view it as an investment.
''At the moment, in fact, I can only survive a loss on every sixth
gig, whereas at the start, 15 years ago, I could exist on losses for one
in every three.''
Glaswegian Clumpas made his start at Dundee University. Ostensibly
studying accountancy and economics, he only attained his degree in order
to continue doing what he really loved: booking bands as student
entertainments convener.
''As an obnoxious 16-year-old, I felt I had a flair for knowing which
bands would sell. I'd be at a packed Apollo saying: 'I knew.' That's the
thrill for me . . . hearing a band's records and spotting their
potential while everyone else is going: 'What's this rubbish?'
''Then, when I'm standing in front of 3000 people at the Playhouse,
it's like everyone's saying: 'Stuart, you're sussed in music, mate.'
Thumbs up. Told ya.''
Clumpas was encouraged by an early run of Dundee scoops. ''I booked
the Pretenders for #300. By the time of the gig they were top of the
singles and albums charts. Same with Peter Gabriel and UB40. I got Def
Leppard when they were on the way up, but too early . . . for #300 --
and they attracted 110 people at 90p each.''
Yet in his greatest success, there was a foretaste of the no-win
situation which promoters inevitably seem to face. ''The Pretenders'
tickets sold out in four hours. And for the next month I got dog's abuse
from people who hadn't got tickets. Terrible amounts of grief from pals;
from people who said I shouldn't have sold the tickets at 9am when they
were in lectures. From everybody.''
Clumpas's greatest financial blow -- caused in 1991 by the mid-gig
cancellation of a Pixies' show when the SECC stage partially collapsed
-- was similarly compounded by personal aggro. ''The band got paid; the
venue got paid; I lost #10,000 . . . plus I got grief from thousands of
ticket-holders. It's the only time so far that I've seriously thought:
'Why am I doing this?'''
It's unsurprising that Stuart Clumpas's life-partner is his
business-partner, too. Judith Atkinson foreswore a medical career for a
degree which combined music -- studying double bass under Gavin Bryars
-- with arts administration. Having once doubled her year's grant with
the staging of a successful alternative freshers' ball, Atkinson
graduated to work with one of Britain's biggest promoters, MCP. Today
she's in charge of DFC's marketing; graphics; bus co-ordination;
advertising; ticket printing, distribution and sales. And she runs King
Tut's.
''Before T In The Park opened last year, we walked out feeling like
worried party hosts. But by 1pm the audience had taken over. They were
enjoying the music, having a pint, knowing what they were supposed to do
. . . it was their festival.''
It's also Geoff Ellis's festival. Despite the fact that midfield
dynamo Ellis broke a leg playing for Blanefield FC in a Forth and
Endrick Summer League cup-tie last month, he's been successfully
negotiating, and liaising with band managers, agents, local councillors,
policemen, environmental health officials, health and safety executives.
Ellis's biggest score? ''A toss-up between having secured Black
Grape's first big gig and having convinced Hamilton District Council
that this year we don't need to provide very costly water bowsers in the
car parks.''
T In The Park: its creators deserve a stiffer drink, if not a cigar.
* T In The Park at Strathclyde Park, August 5 and 6. A 70-strong bill
includes Paul Weller; M People; Terrorvision; Black Grape; The Beautiful
South; Kylie Minogue, Elastica, and The Prodigy. Weekend tickets cost
#45.

ANYONE still harbouring the idea of childrenhood innocence or that
depravity is something that has suddenly emerged through video nasties
would do well to take a peek at actress Gina Moxley's disturbing first
play, Danti-Dan by Dublin's resourceful Rough Magic company.
Set in Cork in the 1970s, its ground is similar to that so
successfully covered by Sharman Macdonald -- adolescence and budding
sexual feelings. But whilst Moxley has great fun expressing the petty
boredoms, antagonisms and run-of-the-mill mating games of her rural
youngsters with their stumbling experiments in kissing and petting,
Danti-Dan becomes something far more sinister.
Sophie Flannery's Cactus, gleaning information from a pulp novel, is
not content with trying things out on her friend, Dolores (a beautiful
performance of amusingly gawky awkwardness from Eileen Walsh) moving on
swiftly to the slightly backward, aspiring cowboy and painfully
susceptible car-spotter, Danti-Dan. Playing on his vulnerabilities,
Sophie eventually leads Danti-Dan to desperate ends.
A terrifying portrait of manipulation, Moxley gives us little sense,
other than a vague indication of adolescent rebellion and spitefulness,
as to exactly why Cactus turns into this architect of destruction other
than the inchoate and random powerfulness of female sexuality. Whether
one finds this reactionary or bravely true-to-life, Moxley's portrait is
unquestionably disturbingly effective for all that Lynn Parker gives it
a buoyantly light-hearted production, studded with fave pop raves from
the period. Not all of the writing -- or playing, for that matter --
quite matches the cumulative effect of the play.
But Moxley shows she has a fine feel for dialogue and character and
Alan King as Dan and Flannery in particular are outstanding. Flannery's
pouting, dishevelled Sophie certainly sent shivers down my spine.

A LOCAL newspaper, whose offices were fire-bombed after it published a
series of articles about drug-related crime, vowed yesterday to continue
its coverage of such issues.
The attack on Wednesday at the main office of the Paisley Daily
Express caused damage to the front part of the premises, including
furniture, computers, and fittings.
The 121-year-old newspaper, which employs 30 editorial, advertising,
and administrative staff on the premises, has reported in detail a
murder and a spate of shootings in Paisley recently as drug barons
battle for control of their trade.
Mr Norman Macdonald, editor of the newspaper, said he was not
intimidated by the incident and vowed today's edition would report the
bombing ''in our normal, factual, and unbiased manner''.
Mr Alex Lumsden, managing director of Scottish and Universal
Newspapers, which owns the newspaper and more than 30 other titles, said
yesterday that it would not be gagged.
''We will report on local issues as they develop and if any local
newspaper fails to do that then they are no longer serving the public
and there is only one ultimate end to that. The newspaper will cease to
exist. We have a very good business in Paisley and we intend to stay
here.''
Mr Lumsden added: ''It has been suggested coverage of recent
drug-related events in Paisley may have led to the attack on our
premises.
''These are serious issues which affect the people of Paisley and we
have a duty to report in a fair and unbiased way what is happening in
our town.

AN Aberdeen teenager, who was just 13 months old when her mother died
in a road crash, faces an anxious wait for the outcome of her bid for
compensation in London's High Court.
Mr Justice Sedley described Miss Samantha Lewis's case as ''very
traumatic'' and, after two days of legal argument, said he would reserve
his judgment.
The judge said: ''I am going to reserve judgment in this case. I want
to consider it. I will hand down my judgment as soon as I can.''
Miss Lewis, now 18, was a passenger in a car driven by her father when
it collided head-on with another in South Benfleet, Essex, in 1977. Her
mother Jane, 21, who was five months pregnant at the time, was killed.
In a case made unique by the passage of more than 17 years, Miss Lewis
is claiming damages for the loss of the love and care of a mother she
was too young to remember. She is suing the other motorist involved in
the crash, whose insurers have accepted 75% liability on his behalf.
Defence counsel, Mr John Bate-Williams, told the judge that Miss Lewis
was not entitled to compensation to reflect the loss of her mother's
affection and love.
Only the loss of her ''services'' -- such as cleaning and cooking --
could be quantified in money terms and damages could not now be assessed
on the basis of what it would have cost to employ a ''notional nanny''
to care for her, he said.
Mr Bate-Williams argued that Miss Lewis had been cared for by her
maternal aunt, Ms Heather Charlesworth, 42, of Aberdeen, and by Essex
County Council -- in whose care she was until her 18th birthday -- as
well as she would have been cared for by her mother.
He said that had the case not been delayed so many years in coming to
court, it might have been appropriate to assess damages on the basis of
the costs of a ''notional nanny''.
However, Miss Lewis was now grown up and would by now have had less
need for her mother's services had she survived. It was
''inappropriate'' to use the cost of a notional nanny in 1994/95 as the
benchmark for assessing the amount of her past loss.
Miss Jacqueline Perry, for Miss Lewis, asked the judge to take a
''liberal and non-restrictive'' approach when making his damages award.
She agreed that the money value of ''emotional'' services and ''love
and affection'' which would have been given to Miss Lewis by her mother
was hard to quantify.
Nevertheless, she asked the judge to make a ''global'' award to
reflect more than simply the loss to Miss Lewis of her mother's
practical and physical services.
She told the judge he would have to stand back from the case, as if he
were a jury, before deciding on an appropriate award in the case.

MORE women are surviving breast cancer, with death rates falling
rapidly during the 90s, according to a report published today.
In women under 80, the death rates in 1993 were 10% lower than in
1985-89 and the decrease was greater in younger than in older women.
Between 1985-89 and 1993, the death rates fell by 14% in women aged
20-49, by 11% in women aged 50-69, and by 5% in women aged 70-79.
Dr Valerie Beral, head of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's
epidemiology unit at Oxford, said earlier and better treatment may well
be responsible: ''The fall in death rates has been very rapid in the
last few years and the decline is due to a number of reasons.
''There is increasing awareness of breast cancer among women and
doctors and women have probably begun to receive treatment earlier.
Early treatment saves lives. Also they are receiving better
treatments.''
The analysis of the figures, from the Office of Population Censuses
and Surveys, is published in The Lancet.

THIS year's London International Festival of Theatre, apart from
extending its international and spatial boundaries, has also embarked on
a certain amount of commissioning from home-grown high-fliers. After
Deborah Warner's extraordinary St Pancras Project, Neil Bartlett's
British premiere of Genet's Splendid's -- written in 1948 but long
regarded as lost and featuring, among others, Julian Clary in his first
''serious'' role -- is, if less experimental, in its own way, no less
challenging.
''Everyone's been had,'' says Richard Hawley's American cop at the end
of Genet's mirror-imaging spoof thriller that draws heavily on the cult
gangster movies of the thirties and forties -- and in what is almost one
of the best moments of Bartlett's stylish, dinner-jacketed production.
As the cast face out the audience, this theatrical cliche suddenly takes
on a new potency. Insolent, and thoroughly subversive, it's entirely in
keeping with a play that plays with gender, role-playing and
deconstruction long before they became the modish trends they are now.
But who has been had? It is all of us who buy into the power of
''image'' as much as the policeman who has bought into the image of
these ''glory boys'' gangsters but who, when they decide to let it go
and are prepared to ''surrender'' cannot forgive what he calls their
''cowardice''.
Overlaid with a heady kind of gay iconography (echoes of Lindsay Kemp
among others), Bartlett's production, in his own translation, keeps well
this side of sobriety. Years ahead of its time in the way Genet
recognises and plays with the umbilical attachment between cop and
criminal, and media and notoriety, Bartlett's production brilliantly
steers between the tacky and the sublime.

Not only an artist but an evocative engineer of memories, Jackie
Donachie has just won the prestigious Fulbright award to study in
America. As Clare Henry reports, she thinks big and uses the minimum to
achieve maximum effect.
JACKIE Donachie talks. Inhibition free, she tells you all about her
day, her life: her sister's new baby, her lost briefcase, her overdraft,
her grandmother in hospital. She is happy to ''confess all my hang-ups
to any available audience''. But whereas other talkers bore, Donachie
has made a career out of her snippets of conversation and details of her
26 years from teenage kicks to twentysomething traumas.
''By the time I was 14 I was tall enough to be either a model or a
policeman . . . The relationship ended, but you know single can be good
-- it just takes some time to readjust and get used to walking home on
your own when the pubs shut . . . My friends say that my sister is
exactly like me. But more. And I was much louder -- she was always the
quiet, shy one, while nobody could ever shut me up.''
Talking has just won her the prestigious Fulbright award to study in
America -- one of only 20 in the UK this year from 400 top-rate
applicants, and normally the preserve of scientists and academics.
''They get people into their forties, from law, medicine or physics. I
was interviewed by an expert on engineering and a professor of
cardiology. I never expected to get an interview, but I felt quite
confident when I got there.
''The first question was: 'Did you always want to paint?' I said I
didn't paint but used text, photography and sound; that the art I made
involved low culture. They didn't have a clue about contemporary art
beyond wee watercolours, so I spent the entire interview giving them a
run through the history of twentieth-century art up to performance and
video!''
In the same week Donachie was involved in the Royal College of Art
show: Make Believe, part of a course for postgraduate curators, all
older than her.
''I'd spent two and a half years on the committee of Glasgow's
artists-run Transmission Gallery, arranging exhibitions. Since 1992,
along with three or four others, I'd been directly responsible for the
planning, initiation, selection and administration of all aspects of the
shows and events. The Royal College curators were totally up-tight
because they were doing it for the first time.''
Donachie invited them all to dinner in a large house in rural
Hertfordshire. ''They didn't really know each other, except at college.
There was a Canadian, a Belgian, 13 in all. I served cocktails; then
during dinner played music: bagpipes as they went in, West Side Story
because everyone did a musical of it at school, Bananarama -- the kind
of tapes that work on the imagination to produce a chain of
associations. You have a soundtrack to your life, whether you like it or
not.''
She taped the three-hour dinner conversation and, for the London show,
edited the best bits and played it on a loop. Previously, in 1994, she
had filled Tramway with 120 speakers sprouting from the walls like
futuristic fungi. It was called Part Edit and she played 45 minutes of
pop songs from the past three decades: Elvis, Bowie, Louis Armstrong,
the Sex Pistols, Adam Ant -- even the Ave Maria -- all interspersed with
her own voice, ''asking questions in a late-night kind of way'', plus
noises-off like sighing, walking, running, dentists' drills and slamming
car doors.
In her commentary she reminisces: ''Somewhere Phil Oakey begins to
sing, deep and mournful, and you're back in your old room at home,
curtains drawn, dreaming of your first love.''
Next Donachie recalls ''that bad night in the disco from hell'' before
ending on an upbeat note, ''that time when everything just seemed so
much better''.
As Douglas Gordon, her colleague at Transmission, said in his account
of her show, ''she uses the minimum of technical means to maximum
effect. It's quite remarkable how she seduced this lonely listener into
becoming an active role player in her theatre of memory''.
Recently in Amsterdam she was part of yet another group show called
Shift, put together at De Appel and featuring Gordon and Ross Sinclair.
Here she proposed a word game on ''loser''.
Says the catalogue: ''A badge on her shirt identifies her as a loser
and, one presumes, due to the list of objects that accompanies the photo
of her sitting looking lost and fed up, a person who loses things too.''
Other shows include London, at Independent Art Space and the South
London Gallery; the San Francisco Art Fair; Connecticut, (a big
self-portrait show); Cologne in October and Germany in July. Meanwhile,
together with three artist friends, she has just helped curate Trust,
the current show at Glasgow's Tramway.
Clever at school, she also got a place to read law. Her teacher
Christine Lyons remembers: ''Jackie was very bright, very academic,
pleasant, articulate -- and single-minded. By fifth year she knew what
she wanted to do. She and her friend Maureen did an amazing amount of
work. I've still got their etchings. It was a one-off class. They were
brilliant and sparked each other off.''
Donachie admits: ''My family would have preferred law at university to
art at college, but Christine won them over. If I'd had to choose my
course straight off, as you do now, I'd have done jewellery. Luckily I
found the environmental art department under David Harding.''
Harding had started the course in 1985. ''Jackie started in 1987/8.
She was always a great leader; could organise and motivate people. I'm
very interested in the unique social phenomenon that is Transmission.
Amazing that this group of artists have worked together for six to eight
years and stayed friends.
''Jackie had developed her own, singular style by fourth year, using
the cultural context of pop songs to make her point. The scale of her
public art projects was also impressive: wall texts 100ft long work in
the Barrowlands; work at every bus shelter along Great Western Road
right out to Knightswood.''
Donachie wants to go to the States. She was there for a month last
year and ''loved the extraordinary openness of life there. I never did
an MA. I went straight to Transmission and my time and energy has often
been spent working more for the benefit of other people than for myself.
The prospect of devoting a year's study to 'selfish' considerations and
development of my own work is exciting and challenging.''
There's one problem. Money. The Fulbright, set up by Senator Fulbright
in 1946 with cash from surplus US war property, with the aim of
promoting international understanding, only provides return travel and
maintenance. Donachie has to find an MA place and cover her tuition
fees. Last week she got a place at Hunter College, City University of
New York. Now she has to find the fees: $6000. ''I've tried all the
usual places. No luck.''
I don't doubt she will find a way. As Lyons says, she's single-minded.
''I had to totally fight not to be expected to do art only in my lunch
hour. I fought to pay off a huge art school overdraft -- as a civil
servant processing census forms in Hillington. I learned to fight for
Transmission, so I guess I can do it again.''
I left her busy with more application forms. ''It's good you've
decided to write about me. That might help,'' she announced ingenuously.
On the wall behind, the text of her latest artwork, Jackie and Susan
is, however, searingly honest. It says: ''We're a bit older now. My
sister's married and settled down, while I'm still borrowing money from
my mum and dad and promising to get a real job.''
I guess the Fulbright committee would be amused at that.

LANDOWNERS and foreign aristocrats have clashed with locals on Arran.
A row over a new tourist development has created a class war between
ordinary islanders and wealthy incomers.
Locals claim upper-crust families and wealthy foreigners could end up
wrecking the precarious tourist trade on Arran.
The dispute centres on the building of the #550,000 Arran Discovery
Centre which tourist chiefs and local businesses say is essential for
the ecomony's long-term survival.
However, council officials have been swamped with letters of protest
-- from as far afield as Washington DC and Paris.
A further 87 objectors -- many of them titled landowners no longer
resident on Arran -- are furious that work on the centre has been given
the go-ahead to start later this summer.
Among the objectors are Ms Sharon Burgett, from Washington DC; Lady
Mary Dunn, from Prestwick, Ayrshire; Ms Kate Stanley-Hughes, of London,
and Mr Oliver Fox, who lives in Paris, and owns a holiday home on the
island.
''It's a wickedness to build something on a hitherto unspoiled part of
the island,'' said the Honourable Michael O'Brien, who lives at The
Lodge, Thursley, in Surrey.
He said he had come to love the island, having visited Arran regularly
for the past 40 years.
''The so-called public demand for this centre is mainly a figment of
somebody's imagination. It's simply the despoilation of an area and the
benefits don't outweigh the horror, ugliness, and crowds it will lead
to.
''No doubt a huge car park will be built and coach loads of people
will flock to the area.''
Local shops and guest houses see the centre as a much-needed boost for
the relatively untrampled west side of the island, which boasts one of
the best neolithic archaeological sites in Europe.
One local hotelier -- who preferred to remain nameless -- said he was
sick of pandering to the ''absent'' wealthy.
He said: ''This centre is exactly the kind of thing we need on the
island. Not only will it bring trade, it might also teach tourists to
respect the island.
''For instance, it's not the first time the new gates near the King's
Caves at Machrie have been sprayed with grafitti.''
Island tourist boss Charles Currie agreed: ''The days of Arran's west
coast being used as a playground for rich landowners is long gone.
''People are no longer happy to simply come to sit on the beach. They
want to be entertained and we have a duty to provide those facilities.''
The interpretation centre will feature Arran over the past 4000 years.

MUSIC from the Baroque era is not traditionally included in the
repertory of the Royal SNO's winter season, but taking advantage of the
relative freedom of the prom series, last night's concert offered a
charming, if a little predictable, selection from Bach, Handel,
Pachelbel, and Albinoni.
Used to getting their teeth stuck into wholesome orchestral scores,
the Royal SNO string players aren't exactly at home with this music.
Bach's third Brandenburg Concerto (strings only) lacked the clarity
essential for the dense textures to shine through. The third Brandenburg
fared slightly better with flautist John Grant able to penetrate the
turgid ensemble.
The Concerto in D minor for two violins survives as one of Bach's
finest. Royal SNO leader and sub-leader Edwin Pailing and Justine Watts
respectively, delivered a fine interpretation, particularly well
balanced in the exquisite central momvement. Weaving a seamless
tapestry, they exchanged melodies and motifs with gentle grace. Outer
movements suffered again at the hands of stodgy strings.
Having challenged my companion to find a link between John Major's
resignation and last night's programme, he came up with the notion that
Albinoni's Adagio would serve as a fitting lament. Approaching the
performance with this in mind, the impact was particularly effective,
peacefully laying the man to rest, for the meantime anyway.
The best playing came last when, joined by wind and brass, the Royal
SNO select rattled through Handel's Water Music. Blazing piccolo
trumpets and warm horn tones added a breath of fresh air to the texture,
bringing light and shade, until then absent from a mostly disappointing
performance.

IT'S a difficult trick to execute, but one which The Jayhawks manage
with considerable aplomb: a young band to play to a predominantly young
audience what is essentially old music.
Old in as much as they are presenting a fairly traditional brand of
American country-tinged rock (the lineage stems from Buffalo Springfield
and Creedance Clearwater Revival, but somehow succeeds in missing the
many inferior copyists in between), but young and vibrant in the
presentation of these ingredients.
It's sometimes difficult to pinpoint what makes The Jayhawks so
special as a live act when so many of their peers are merely adequate.
It could be the strength of Mark Olson and Gary Louris's shared vocals,
it may be the sparse proficiency of the playing (eyes are never shut
during their succinct guitar solos), but more likely the key to their
appeal is in the songs.
The most recent album, Tomorrow The Green Grass, is less rounded than
its predecessor, Hollywood Town Hall, but it still contains many
highlights: the majestic single Blue, the best obsession song of the
year in Miss Willam's Guitar, and the brilliant Bad Time, augmented by a
typically exuberant guest vocal from Texas's Sharleen Spiteri.
The real treasures, however, come in the shape of older material like
Take Me With You, a song so anthemic and potentially pompous that Jon
Bon Jovi and Rod Stewart should kill for it, but in The Jayhawks's hands
it sounds, if anything, understated.
Settled Down Like Rain, Wichita and I'd Run Away are further examples
of the same blueprint, duelling guitars and harmonies backed by solid
rhythms and rolling piano lines, topped off by lyrics tinged with
sadness but which combine with the music to be joyous and uplifting.
A packed Garage may have been appreciative, but with little to
recommend them in the way of gimmicks or looks, The Jayhawks are far
from faceless country rock; the music is underrated, the songs glorious,
and the end result often brilliant.

SMILE please. If these four boys from Troon have their way, the dental
surgery of the future will be far more user-friendly for younger
patients.
The boys from Class 4B at Troon Primary School -- Antony John, David
Nelson, Cameron Sharkey, and Alasdair Thom -- have won a competition run
by Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Care NHS Trust to design a
surgery which would be more attractive to their contemporaries.
Their plan included free apples, toys, and a video library with Sega
games. The dentist was a mixture of a Thunderbirds character and
Aladdin.
As National Smile Week drew to a close yesterday, the four were joined
by head teacher Mrs Fiona Taylor to try out dental equipment of the past
in the shape of a portable chair and tools from 50 years ago.
Mrs Taylor said: ''We are very pleased to have won the competition and
the boys are delighted with their Lego sets.''

Margaret Vaughan examines Tony Blair's education policy with its
distinctively different forms on either side of the Border.
FOR some it signals the end of comprehensive education. For others it
is the death knell for opted-out schools. How people view Labour's plans
for education in England and Wales seems to depend on which knee they
jerk with. In Scotland they were viewed with lofty detachment.
Only one Scottish school has opted out, compared to 1055 over the
Border. Dornoch Academy in the Highlands is the solitaire, the only tiny
jewel in the crown of the Government's education reforms. It illustrates
the distinctively different shape of education north and south of the
Border.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday said Labour's
policy in Scotland would continue to reflect the unique nature of the
Scottish education system. The core values in the document Diversity and
Excellence though, were apt in Scotland and would govern Labour's
approach to Scottish schools.
There was a shared commitment both north and south of the Border to
quality in education, discipline, the maximum amount of control devolved
to schools, and more parental involvement in their running.
All schools, he said, would be funded on a fair and equitable basis.
Schools should have a fair admissions policy and should be accountable,
to the community and parents through the local education authority.
What seems clear is that, although Scotland has its own distinctively
different system of education, the fundamentals of Labour policy will
undoubtedly seep into thinking which will determine the shape of schools
when, or if, Labour comes to power.
The Scottish party is currently looking at all aspects of education
policy, including the organisation and management of schools. A more
arms-length relationship between schools and local authorities may be in
the offing, along with a greater delegation of budgets.
''Schools should have the opportunity to make for themselves as many
decisions as practicable,'' Robertson stressed.
It seems unlikely to mean the reintroduction of selection, given the
political complexion of the new unitary authorities, nor is there likely
to be a return to the intellectual caste system of dividing children
into junior and senior secondary schools, given Tony Blair's insistence
yesterday that the best of the comprehensive system did not divide
children into successes and failures at the age of 11.
Appealing for doubters in his own party to recognise that the
principles proposed did not endanger the comprehensive principle but
modernised it, Blair said: ''The document is entirely consistent with
the principles of the comprehensive system, but in a modernised way. The
principle should not be about uniformity, but diversity and choice and a
system that, above all, is fair.''
It was a theme echoed by George Robertson who said the interests of
pupils had to come first, and that policy should not be determined by
dogma.
So devolved budgets are in, and school boards seem likely to be given
a greater say in determining priorities within their school, offering
parents extra clout in local decision-making.
Labour's Scottish education spokeswoman, Maria Fyfe, insisted there
was no contradiction in two different sets of policy being applied. She
said: ''Education policy in Scotland will remain, like the Scottish
education system, distinctly different. There's no contradiction. In
Scotland, opting out has been shown not to be what the vast majority of
parents want.''
If Labour wins power, Dornoch Academy will be returned to local
authority control, she claimed. As will any other schools which ship out
in the interim. So far, only a small, former Episcopalian-church school,
St Mary's in Dunblane, seems likely to be self-governing by the time of
the next election.
While over the Border, left and right -- led respectively by the
unlikely class-warrior Roy Hattersley, and the chirpy Education
Secretary Gillian Shephard -- bray betrayal in unison, Scottish
educationalists were equally unanimous in pointing out that the
different education system in Scotland, evolved over centuries, combines
with differences in the political landscape to require a different set
of priorities for Scottish schools.
Opt-out schools in England and Wales were the flagships of the
Government's education reforms. The new policy will not abolish them,
but give them equal funding with local authority schools, and insist on
more local authority involvement in their management through membership
of boards of governors.
Professor of Educational Policy at Glasgow University, Nigel Grant,
said the roots of education north and south of the Border were diverse:
''The educational systems have always been different. The Education Act
in 1870 set up schools in England for the children of the working
classes. In Scotland they were for all of the people.''
Schools in England had been ''bribed'' to opt out of local authority
control, by extra funding, Professor Grant said. He welcomed the plan to
end such divisive funding. It was clear, he said, that Scottish parents
were not persuaded that under the opt-out policy their children would
receive any better an education than under the present system.
It was a theme echoed by Anne Hill, president of the Scottish School
Board Association, who said that any impetus towards opting out in
Scotland had come only from parents who feared losing schools through
closure or government reorganisation. The inquiries made to the
association about exercising the opt-out option were invariably made for
negative rather than positive reasons.
''The response we have had has been negative, in as much as people
have said -- we have devolved school management and opting out doesn't
offer more than that.''
Why had Scottish parents not been persuaded by the policy? ''We don't
need it,'' Hill argues. ''The vast majority of parents here are happy
with the service that the local education authority provides. School
boards in a supportive role and helping run schools are totally
different from taking control.''
She would have preferred to see opting out as an option abolished, to
end a divided system of education: ''Parental choice will mean you pick
the school you want for your child anyway. Every child deserves an equal
right to education and it's wonderful that at least the inequity of the
bribes system to self-governing schools is to end.''
Labour's proposals south of the Border are seen as a finely calculated
balancing act. It was put to Blair yesterday that some in his party
believed Labour's policy was influenced by his decision to send his son
to an opt-out school. His response was sharp: ''There are hundreds of
thousands of parents with pupils going to GM (opted-out) schools.
''I want the best for my child but I also want the best for all
children in our country.''

BBC SCOTLAND set out yesterday to prove that, in the midst of drama
and the occasional crisis, it has not lost its sense of humour. Over the
next six months, it will provide the network with no fewer than five
comedy pilot shows.
For Mr Colin Gilbert, head of comedy at Queen Margaret Drive, the
search for the next Rab C Nesbitt is a serious business. Having
witnessed his neighbours in the drama department score a huge ratings
success with Hamish Macbeth, his intention is now to tackle (not to
mention tickle) the nation's funny bone.
The new shows, some of which BBC Scotland hopes will be developed into
series, involve stars like Elaine Collins, Gordon Kennedy, Terry Neason,
and Elaine C Smith. In addition, Mr Gilbert also unveiled details of the
return of Gregor Fisher and Rikki Fulton in another three-part series of
The Tales of Para Handy.
The opportunity to increase Scotland's comedy output has come about in
part from the BBC's ongoing policy of ''devolving'' more programme
commissions to the regions. More important, however, is the injection of
a development budget from BBC Enterprises, the corporation's commercial
arm, which has reaped substantial profits from the video sales of
Scottish comedy programmes like Naked Video, Rikki Fulton, and Rab C
Nesbitt.
Mr Gilbert said: ''This is not some frantic effort to find a
replacement for Rab C. Rather it is an attempt to develop a critical
mass so that we are not starting from scratch. It is recognition that
Glasgow will be the only place outside London where there will be a
major comedy contribution to the network production.''
The end of Rab C Nesbitt, however, is far from nigh. A fifth series
will start filming in September and there is no suggestion that it will
be the last.
''What tends to happen is that you usually know, one series before the
audience knows, when something has had its day and that it is time to
stop. I thought the fourth series was probably the best and there are no
signs of letting up.
''But we will not flog it to death. I think we made a mistake with
City Lights by pushing it one series beyond where we should have taken
it. We learned a lesson.''
Mr Gilbert did not think his clutch of new pilots, some of which are
very Scottish in their content and treatment, would cause a problem for
English audiences. Indeed, he said national audience research suggested
that Scottishness was a plus point for them.
Of the new shows, the automatic pilot is probably Pulp Video. It is a
''fast-moving, irreverent sketch show'', a kind of Naked Video II -- The
Nightmare Continues if you like. It features a range of new writers and
comedians, including stand-up comics Fred MacAuley, Parrot, and Ford
Kiernan.
Fresh from his success in presenting the National Lottery, Gordon
Kennedy stars in two of the pilot sitcoms. The more controversial is
Mac, about a rabid Scottish nationalist (Jack Docherty), a man so
extreme in his views that he would file Scottish Watch under ''wimps''.
Kennedy also features in Atletico Partick, a comedy about a Sunday pub
league football team from the pen of Ian Pattison, creator of Rab C
Nesbitt.
Elaine C Smith and Louise Beattie star in Only The Lonely, a sitcom
about a dating agency, written by Bob Black, the writer of City Lights.
English comedy duo Trevor Neal and Simon Hickson feature in their own
one-off show, The Trev and Simon Summer Special.

SHELL has confirmed it will ask for permission to temporarily park the
Brent Spar in a Norwegian fjord, it was revealed yesterday.
Caving in to pressure from environmentalists and European governments,
the petroleum giant shelved plans on Tuesday to dump the rig in the
Atlantic. The Brent Spar is now under tow with no destination in sight.
''We have now received a letter from Shell which says they will
request mooring permission in a Norwegian fjord,'' Jens Stoltenberg,
Minister of Industry and Energy, said. He expected a formal request
within a day or two.
Reacting to the furore over the disused oil platform, Sweden yesterday
called for a two-year moratorium on the dumping of oil platforms.
It said it would put its proposal to a meeting of the Oslo and Paris
Commission for protection of the North-east Atlantic in Brussels on June
26-30.
The commission is due to submit proposals to the next International
Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, to be held in 1997.
Germany and Denmark went further, demanding a total ban on such
dumping.
Meanwhile, an Austrian businessman yesterday offered to take over the
Brent Spar and turn it into a maritime casino and disco.
Norbert Brust wants to anchor the platform in international waters in
the North Sea and bring in rich customers by helicopter and ferry for
tax-free entertainment.
Brust said he had no idea how the Spar would first be cleaned of toxic
oil wastes and added he had no investors.
A Shell spokeswoman said his proposal was one of a dozen or so
volunteering ways of using the obsolete rig.

Elizabeth Buie meets a group of villagers who became ill after
oil-seed rape was cultivated near their Tayside homes
TO some, it has been tantamount to a rape of the landscape -- vibrant
splashes of yellow, scattered across a green, rolling countryside,
scarring familiar views.
For some farmers, the advent of oil-seed rape in Scotland in 1981
brought lucrative markets, and attractive subsidies from the European
Commission.
But many people living in rural areas have claimed the rape crop has
caused them to suffer from headaches, skin and eye irritations, sneezing
and coughing.
Up till now, the link has only been assumed. But a report to be
published shortly in the Scottish Medical Journal provides the first
concrete evidence of a definite link.
Dr David Parratt and his research team in the medical-microbiology
department at Ninewells Hospital and Medical School in Dundee claim to
have established that exposure to the plant while it is in flower causes
a number of symptoms in otherwise healthy people living near oil-seed
rape fields.
A control group of 25 people in the village of Stormontfield, near
Scone palace on the outskirts of Perth, were the guinea pigs that
provided the evidence.
Dr Parratt had been looking at medical problems caused by oil-seed
rape since 1989, and the director of environmental health at Angus
District Council, Les Cameron, had been receiving scores of complaints
from members of the public.
''But we could not prove it. The objection to any of these claims has
always been that they were all very well, but you needed to study a
controlled population. Finding a controlled population is not easy. Even
if you select 50 Dundonians, you don't know that they are not going to
get into an oil-seed rape area and become exposed to it,'' said Dr
Parratt.
The breakthrough came in 1992.
Dr Bill Macfarlane-Smith, project leader at the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee, was contacted by a member of Stormontfield
Community Association asking for help.
The villagers had 180 hectares of oil-seed rape planted on every side
of the village, and many were complaining of various health problems.
As Laurence Fettes, of Colenhaugh, Stormontfield, said: ''You couldn't
get in or out of the place without passing rape fields. We had never had
anything like that concentration of rape before -- it was a sea of
yellow. Swimming in the river was the only way to get rid of the
stuff.''
Dr Macfarlane-Smith's project team set up a wind gauge and a pollen
counter in his garden, and he and his wife were asked to wear a
pollen-measuring disc on their lapel at all times during a 10-week
period.
Mr Fettes did not suffer any symptoms, but his wife Jean's eyes were
badly irritated. They itched, as if there was something in them, and she
had to apply eye drops. Some of their neighbours suffered headaches, and
others complained of chest or nasal congestion.
Every day they filled in a diary detailing their symptoms. At the end
of each week, a nurse collected the diaries.
A few houses along from the Fettes's house, lives Hazel Sanders. She
was suffering from a severe rash round her eyes and facial swelling.
''My face puffed up twice its normal size, but when we got down to the
coast, the symptoms disappeared,'' she said.
She claims that one young girl had to be taken to hospital, and that
the oil-seed rape was even killing birds.
She blames insecticides sprayed on the rape fields for her problem,
but Dr Parratt is not so sure. And although the symptoms resemble those
caused by hay-fever allergens, they are clinically different, he says.
The 10-week study was divided into three sections by the researchers.
During the first and third phases, symptoms remained relatively low, but
during the middle phase, when the oil-seed rape was in flower, symptoms
went up dramatically.
''They coincided exactly with the peak flowering,'' he said.
The following year, the nearest rape field to Stormontfield was more
than a mile away. Symptoms had dropped considerably. In 1994, the same
control group's symptoms were down even more.
''This was a unique way of getting a control population -- to study
the same population in a year when they were exposed and then another
year when they were not. It has proved really beyond any doubt that the
two things were associated,'' said Dr Parratt.
But what the study has not discovered is what it is in the oil-seed
rape that causes the symptoms. Dr Parratt and Dr Macfarlane-Smith will
not rule out pollen, fungus, or insecticides, although on balance they
do not believe these are the culprits.
A more likely candidate, or rather candidates, may be found in the
180-odd volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) found in oil-seed rape. But
with so many VOCs (in basic terms, the pungent chemicals emitted from
the plant) it is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.
That is likely to be the next area of research for the Dundee experts.
There is little reason to hope that farmers are likely to grow less
oil-seed rape in future. The crop may have been one of the products
targeted in the GATT talks last year, meaning that the EU has had to
limit its agricultural cultivation.
Never the less, farmers who grow rape on set-aside land for industrial
purposes -- usually to make rape methyl-ester (RME), a substitute for
diesel -- are entitled to subsidies. As environmentalists hail RME as a
cleaner fuel than diesel, there seems little hope that the yellow pocket
handkerchiefs on our landscapes are going to shrink in size.

A SPECIAL bench of five judges is to decide whether a conviction under
Scots law can be challenged on the grounds that the defence lawyer
conducted the case incompetently.
The judges will look at the validity of a 1949 ruling that an appeal
on these grounds is not allowed. The court will also consider whether
Scots law is now out of step on this issue with legal systems in other
parts of the world.
It is understood a number of other people are awaiting a ruling
because they also wish to attack the way their defence was conducted at
their trial.
The point has been raised by the case of James Anderson, 43, who was
jailed for three years and nine months at the High Court in Glasgow in
February last year after being convicted of assault to severe injury and
permanent disfigurement.
He is appealing against the conviction on the grounds that he suffered
a miscarriage of justice because he was incompetently represented in
court.
The case was considered by Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General,
sitting with Lords Weir and Cameron at the Court of Criminal Appeal, who
decided to convene a large bench to reconsider the 1949 case.
That was decided by three judges and it would take a larger bench to
overrule it.
In the 1949 case, a man convicted on two charges of theft by
housebreaking asked for leave to appeal, alleging that the solicitor for
the poor who had been assigned to him had failed to ensure that he
received a fair trial.
The appeal court was told the solicitor had been appointed to the case
only two days before, had not competently cross-examined Crown
witnesses, and that the defence case had not been properly placed before
the jury.
Lord Justice Clerk Thomson, sitting with Lords Mackay and Keith,
decided that a lack of skill or diligence in the preparation or conduct
of a defence could not be pleaded as a ground for claiming a miscarriage
of justice.
Until now, Scots law has generally taken the view that the conduct of
a case in court, for example what questions to ask or not to ask, must
be left to the professional judgment of the lawyer concerned.
However, in a recent English case, appeal judges described as a grave
mistake the failure of a defence lawyer to persuade the accused to give
evidence in a case where a direct challenge to the alleged victim's
evidence was crucial.
The court indicated that it was willing to allow an appeal where a
decision had been taken during the trial in defiance of or without
proper instructions ''when all promptings of reason and good sense
pointed the other way''.
In an earlier English case, the Lord Chief Justice declared:
''Generally speaking, it is only when counsel's conduct of the case can
be described as flagrantly incompetent advocacy that this court will be
minded to intervene.''

NEW doors were opened in Scotland yesterday for the Christian church
in China.
Bishop Jin Luxian, Catholic Bishop of Shanghai and a prisoner of the
communist regime for 27 years, addressed a conference organised by
Scottish Churches' China Group.
He was accompanied by Mr Zhang Jing Long, from the China Christian
Council in Nanjing which represents Protestant faiths. This was another
first for the ecumenical movement, since in the People's Republic
Protestantism and Catholicism have long been classed as entirely
separate religions.
Bishop Jin said the church had been a growing force in the last
decade, when the Government had moved towards religious tolerance, but
faced difficulties in some areas, including a shortage of priests.
It also took a more pragmatic stance than the Vatican to the problems
of China's rising population. Whilst disapproving of abortion, it did
endorse contraception as a necessary means of population control.
Mr Zhang said that whereas Christianity relied on its traditional
appeal in rural areas, there was a growing interest in the cities from
the ''Coca-cola Christians'' -- young Chinese attracted to the faith
because of its associations with fashionable Western culture.

THIRD ESTATE'S first-ever show was Burning Issues. I remember seeing
it at a National Review of Live Art platform down in Manchester. Bearing
out the company's full title -- Third Estate Music and Dance -- there
were, in fact, more musicians on stage than dancers. Half a dozen, if I
remember rightly, including a truly stonkin' horn section that brassed
out rich, rapid rhythms while three girls -- short black frocks, clumpy
black boots -- whirled through moves that suggested Anne Teresa de
Keersmaeker in ecstatic club mode!
The piece itself had been suggested by the furore over Salman
Rushdie's Satanic Verses and dealt in images of belief, the power it
exerts over people, its effects on the wider world.
Some things have changed since that striking 1990 debut. The
co-operative within the company has altered so that it now includes
visual artists and film-makers. The music, too, has moved in new
directions. More ''techno'' said Ruth Jones, one of the original
estaters.
But if the line-up of live musicians has gone, the core impulse to
explore topical social issues has stayed put.
This new piece, specially commissioned by Paisley Arts Centre, is
about control and surveillance. The audience will arrive, expecting to
sit back and watch a performance -- they will instead find themselves
promenading under video surveillance. But then, as Ruth Jones points
out, this is already happening to members of the public in shops, town
centres, even in some housing schemes.
In panopticon this ''invisible'' policing is given a more obvious
profile. Jones says: ''We're using lots of fencing, lots of metal.
Water. Gravel. Wire. Searchlights. When people turn up, they won't see a
theatre!'' Instead, as Jones goes on to explain, audiences will find
themselves being moved round these alien environments -- is it a
futuristic city, is it a prison? -- where it becomes harder to decide
who's on what side of the fence, and who's really being monitored.
The commission which has given the company two weeks to transform the
spaces in a manner which has left administrator John Harding
''gobsmacked'' has also enabled them to make closer contact with local
youth groups. ''The past two touring shows, we've come for just one
performance and then disappeared. And the people who saw us really liked
the work. There was a kind of disappointment that we couldn't stay on
longer.
''This time we've been able to do workshops in between putting the
entire show together, everything from making the film to actually
devising the work. It's been hectic, but everybody's been tremendously
supportive.'' And just to prove that the Buddies at the arts centre have
been keeping a watchful eye on the company's wellbeing -- the cafe has
apparently kept them going in free buns.
* Panopticon can be seen at Paisley Arts Centre tonight and tomorrow
at 8pm.

THIS ROOM, with its rickety chest, creaky bed, and wonky wash basin,
exists in the jungle of bedsitters. Here it's hard to know just where
you are with other people, with yourself, even. It can feel lonely --
and yet folk seem to wander in and out, uninvited. Is this what's meant
by friendship? Are any of these people happy? Is any of this real? How
can you know what anything means at the time?
Yet again, Alias Compagnie (from Geneva) explore the shifting
undercurrents of relationships -- from shared sillinesses and intimacy
to sudden isolation -- in a dance piece that is perceptive, deliciously
wry, sometimes stunningly surreal. Audiences who saw En Manque at last
year's Mayfest will remember a dance style that was highly physical yet
full of expressive subtlety -- you could tell what people were thinking
from the way they moved, stood, or sat atop that high, curving wall.
Moving a perhaps uses that same, marvellous clarity but uses it to
point up poignant uncertainties. Everyone who appears in this bedsit
room -- where lush jungle foliage is painted across the walls -- seems
to veer between extremes of mood and even between partners. There is a
hectic, hothouse feel to the encounters that burst in on the lone female
occupant until suddenly, like a tropical storm, torrents of water
descend . . . Forget Eurocrash -- choreographer Guilhermo Botelho has
devised Eurosplash! Bodies, limbs glistening, clothes sodden, surrender
to the deluge like water sprites.
The edgy energy of earlier sequences, razzy with bizarre humour and
grabbing, groping sexuality, is succeeded by something more mystical yet
equally as intense. Highly articulate, dramatic dance with a true flair
for visual imagery and a genuine care for human kind -- not least when
it pursues happiness through tears and cataclysmic downpours. Repeated
tonight and tomorrow -- not to be missed.

FRICTION between two neighbours was ruled on in court yesterday.
The dispute started in 1988 when Mr Ian Harley moved to Saughton Loan,
Saughtonhall, Edinburgh, to the flat directly above Mr William Donegan.
They got off on the wrong foot. Noise complaints from Mr Donegan
started flooding in -- one council official said it felt as if he had
been called out ''about 300 times''.
Eventually, Mr Harley became exasperated and cut Mr Donegan's TV
aerial cable.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Mr Donegan was granted an
interdict to stop Mr Harley from abusing or threatening him.
Sheriff Nigel Thomson said the two men were mild-mannered, except with
each other. It was not substantiated that Mr Harley deliberately made as
much noise as possible, as Mr Donegan claimed, but he said it was
''deplorable'' that the case ever came to court.

LABOUR faced attacks from all sides at Westminster yesterday over its
handling of the Monklands scandal, as the Scottish National Party
demanded the resignation of local MPs Mr Tom Clarke and Mrs Helen
Liddell for their ''culpability'' in the affair.
The Prime Minister seized on Labour's embarrassment during Question
Time to endorse a call for all those with further information on
allegations of corruption and nepotism in Monklands District Council to
come forward.
Commending those who had worked to expose the activities, Mr Major
said: ''A remarkable number of relatives of Monklands councillors seem
to have been employed by the council. Their personnel department was
more like a family planning department than anything else.''
Earlier, SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said the recent elections to the
new unitary authority, as well as the Monklands East by-election last
summer, should be rerun.
''The people from the council elected to the new unitary authorities
were elected under false pretences,'' he said.
The same applied to the by-election following the death of Mr John
Smith. Mrs Helen Liddell, who won the contest, described the allegations
as ''tittle-tattle'', he said.
Doubts extended to Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, he
said. ''I find it inconceivable to believe that George Robertson did not
come across this information as I did during the by-election last
year.''
The Liberal Democrats called on Labour to appoint independent members
to its internal inquiry, and to make its findings public.
Monklands council leader Jim Brooks last night declined to comment on
Mr Clarke's statement.
On Wednesday, Lord Nolan announced he would include the Monklands
affair in his inquiry into standards in public life. Following the
publication this week by Professor Robert Black QC of his report
claiming Monklands District Council was rife with nepotism, prejudice,
and unfair spending, Labour suspended all Monklands councillors and
launched a fresh inquiry.

''LET ME just make a brief statement to you. I've been deeply involved
in politics since I was 16. I see public service as a duty and if you
can serve, I believe you have an obligation to do so.
''I've now been Prime Minister for nearly five years. In that time
we've achieved a great deal, but for the last three years I've been
opposed by a small minority in our party.
''During those three years there have been repeated threats of a
leadership election. In each year, they turned out to be phoney threats.
Now the same thing again is happening in 1995.
''I believe this is in no-one's interest that this continues right
through until November. It undermines the Government and it damages the
Conservative party.
''I am not prepared to see the party I care for laid out on the rack
like this any longer.
''To remove this uncertainty I have this afternoon tendered my
resignation as leader of the Conservative Party to Sir Marcus Fox, the
chairman of the 1922 committee, and requested him to set the machinery
in motion for an election of a successor.
''I have confirmed to Sir Marcus that I shall be a candidate in that
election.
''If I win, I shall continue as Prime Minister and lead the party into
and through the next general election.
''Should I be defeated, which I do not expect, I shall resign as Prime
Minister and offer my successor my full support.
''The Conservative Party must make its choice. Every leader is leader
only with the support of his party. That is true of me as well.
''That is why I am no longer prepared to tolerate the present
situation. In short, it is time to put up or shut up. I have nothing
more to say this afternoon. Thank you very much.

THE House of Commons was last night gripped by one of the most
dramatic developments in its history after Mr Major's announcement that
he planned to stand down.
His decision to stand firm on his policies and challenge his critics
caused chaotic scenes in the chamber with Opposition MPs calling for the
suspension of the sitting while the constitutional position was
clarified.
One senior Labour MP, Mr Nigel Spearing, said the Prime Minister had
lost the confidence of both the House and the country, and has also lost
the confidence of this Parliament.
Another Labour MP demanded to know ''who is running this country?''
However, the Deputy Speaker, Dame Janet Fookes, said: ''My
understanding is that Mr Major has not announced his resignation as
Prime Minister. These are two separate offices.''
She maintained she had no indication of a Ministerial statement on the
issue. With MPs clamouring for one, she said: ''I see no reason for an
adjournment.''
She urged Government and Opposition business managers to get together
and decide on a course of action.
Shadow Leader of the Commons, Mrs Anne Taylor, said: ''There is a
complete sense of disintegration about this Government. We need to be
sure that Ministers speak with the authority of the Prime Minister and
that clearly is not the case.''
The House was taken by surprise by the announcement. Many MPs already
had gone back to their constituencies on a quiet day.
However, although there was only a handful of MPs in the chamber when
Mr Major made his announcement, as news filtered through, Labour MPs
poured into the chamber. There were hurried discussions on both Front
Benches.
One of Labour's trade and industry spokesmen, Mr Stuart Bell, was the
first to break the news to the House.
He then challenged the Speaker: ''Have you had any notification
yourself of this statement? Have you had any notification that the Prime
Minister will come to the House and make a statement? And have you had
any indication at all that the most appropriate thing to do in all the
circumstances is to call a General Election?''
As the excitement grew, Mr Andrew Mackinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock,
claimed the announcement raised constitutional issues which required a
statement from the Government.
He said: ''Mr Major is not just leader of the Conservative Party but
also the Prime Minister and it seems to me we need to know who is
running this country if anyone is at all.''
When Dame Janet said they were separate offices, Mr Mackinlay shouted:
''This is like a banana republic.''
Liberal Democrat Menzies Campbell said the news was ''unprecedented in
modern political times''.
Mr Campbell said: ''I do not believe such an event has happened in the
course of this century. Does not that raise some very fundamental issues
which it would only be right for the House to have the opportunity to
consider?''
The protests continued but the feeling around the House was that it
was a party matter and should not interfere at this stage with
Government business.

HE Prime Minister has launched his last gamble for authority,
providing at the same time Mr Michael Heseltine's last chance of
attaining his dream for the Premiership.
Mr Major said yesterday: ''I've had enough. This has to be sorted out
once and for all.''
Mr Heseltine confined himself to: ''My position is clear: I am
supporting him.''
The Tory leadership elections sprung on the party by Mr Major will
take place on July 4. By next Thursday, Mr Heseltine, Mr Norman Lamont,
and others will have to decide their answer to the Prime Minister's
''Put up or shut up.''
As Mr Major made his announcement on the lawn behind No 10 at 5pm, the
bell on Horse Guards was tolling. ''If you can serve, you should do
so,'' he said.
Within minutes the news that he was resigning as Tory leader to stand
again on July 4, was around the world.
In Paris, Baroness Thatcher observed: ''Of course the Cabinet will
support him -- in the first ballot.'' Five years ago she was in Paris at
a summit when her parliamentary party dumped her.
President Bill Clinton wished Mr Major well, called him ''a great
ally'' and praised his courage in pursuing peace in Northern Ireland. He
said ''he has maintained a strong relationship between the UK and the
US''.
The Queen was being ''kept abreast'' of developments. Buckingham
Palace said there were no immediate constitutional implications as he
had stepped down from the Conservative Party leadership and not the
Premiership.
However, in the House of Commons there were points of order about the
constitutional situation. The only Cabinet Minister on the Front Bench
was Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell.
Behind the Speaker's chair observing was Mr Heseltine, absenting
himself from the Front Bench. Twice in 25 minutes he left the chamber to
pace a corridor alone and thinking.
He had not been surprised. The Prime Minister had informed him as he
did all other Cabinet Ministers individually immediately after
yesterday's routine Cabinet meeting.
The Prime Minister has resolved his dilemma. The entire membership of
the back-bench 1922 Committee is endorsing his candidature for
re-election as party leader. The entire Cabinet is supporting him for
July 4.
Mr Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, clearly has not
resolved his dilemma. The only honourable thing he can do if he thinks
Mr Major is going to lose is resign from the Cabinet and stand now. This
he is not doing.
The leading candidate as stalking horse, with the precise intention of
toppling yet another Tory Prime Minister, is Mr Lamont, who bitterly
resents being sacked by Mr Major a year after he took the blame for the
''Black Wednesday'' devaluation of sterling.
Last night Mr Lamont was also said to be staggered by the Prime
Minister's pre-emptive strike. He was banking on a leadership election
in November which might cause sufficient abstentions in the Tory
Parliamentary Party -- the sole judges of this issue -- to get himself
reinstated by a Major successor into the Cabinet. Now he has to reassess
the chances of this working in 12 days time.
The key question is whether Mr Major can win the leadership election,
which he has brought forward, sufficiently well. ''If I win I shall
continue as Prime Minister and lead the party into and through the next
General Election. Should I be defeated, which I do not expect, I shall
resign as Prime Minister and offer my successor my full support.''
He rammed it home to the Conservative Party the unprecedented
importance of July 4. ''The Conservative Party must make its choice.
Every leader is leader only with the support of his party. That is why I
am no longer prepared to tolerate the present situation. In short, it is
time to put up or shut up.''
His hardline opponents on Europe and his enemies are going to take
this as a literal challenge. Several leading Tory right wingers judged
last night: ''He is dead in the water.'' Major's team insists that so
far from that being the case, his authority will be established as
unchallengeable.
All 22 Government Ministers in the Lords have pledged their full
support to the Prime Minister. They have no votes, but much influence in
Tory constituencies.
Next month Mr Major is intending a reshuffle and he expects to be
reinstated as leader overwhelmingly. His reshuffle would have
additional, and perhaps, vital impact on the nation where he languishes
in the latest opinion polls 39% behind Mr Tony Blair.
The Labour leader declared yesterday that ''this is a sign of
desperation. He is utterly unfit to govern this country. This is a
matter in the national interest not just a party matter. It affects
Government. The Conservative Party is fundamentally divided.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, who is the key member of Major's campaign
team which is headed by the leaders of both Lords and Commons, Lord
Cranborne and Mr Tony Newton, said yesterday: ''I expect the whole
Cabinet will be supporting the Prime Minister, the whole Government and
indeed the majority of the parliamentary party.''
Mr Lang and another member of the Prime Minister's campaign team,
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney, were on the balcony overlooking the
No. 10 lawn with Mrs Norma Major when the Prime Minister issued his
statement to a news conference which had been called less than an hour
before.
On the stroke of 5pm, Mr Major began his four paragraph statement. He
did not take questions although he gave television interviews
afterwards.
He told ITN: ''It's time to sort it out once and for all. I have had
enough of it. The sensible thing to do is to sort it out once and for
all.''
0 The Prime Minister's announcement was delayed for half-an-hour. He
was waiting to hear the reaction of the weekly Tory back-benchers'
meeting when their chairman, Sir Marcus Fox, announced his decision and
the fact that the entire 1922 Executive is nominating the Prime Minister
for re-election.
This was greeted by banging of desk tops and cheers. Only the
dedicated and fanatic anti-Majorites were restrained. There were no
speeches. Just the announcement of the technicalities of the leadership
election. Nominations close next Thursday for a first ballot on July 4
which will be followed on July 11 by a second ballot if necessary.
Last night at the Commons, which rose early, cantering through its
day's business, the abstention factor in the leadership election was
becoming the talking point. Tory MPs in the 60 marginal seats may turn
out to be the ones who decide the issue by sorting it out once and for
all as Mr Major would like, or leaving him a victor but a further
undermined one.
There is talk of the parliamentary party's rules being changed in
order to prevent a further leadership election in November, or indeed
again next year, if Mr Major wins, but crippled by more than 100
abstentions the calculation that he is dead in the water may turn out to
be true.
During the last three days, the Prime Minister has observed to his
closest Cabinet colleagues that the situation is so bad that he is in a
''if they don't want me, I'm going'' mood. He believes he can win, but
he is not prepared for his life as Prime Minister to continue to be made
insufferable.
The other view sweeping the Tory ranks last night was a calculation as
to whether a defeat at the next General Election can be ameloriated.
This may be their last chance to prevent a landslide Labour victory.
The Prime Minister is aware of this, as is his campaign team, all of
whom believe the game is not worth the candle for Mr Major if his
parliamentary party will not give him the essential unity and loyalty.
And this now has to be demonstrated to the electorate dramatically,
specifically and without qualification.

FROM the Prime Minister's point of view, things were going to get
worse as the year progressed: continuing bickering culminating in a
party conference prior to a leadership election in November. ''I've had
enough,'' he said yesterday. ''This has got to be sorted out once and
for all.''
A letter to The Times yesterday from Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew highlighted his predicament. Sir Patrick stated that the
undermining of Mr Major's authority was damaging the peace process.
Quite suddenly, Mr Major's analysis changed.
The peace process is just too important to be jeopardised by his
enemies in the Tory parliamentary party. On Wednesday, he spoke to his
closest colleagues to assess the situation and what could be done about
it.
The prospect of the next five months, irrespective of a Cabinet
reshuffle in the next few weeks, was appalling. Throughout the summer,
speculation would continue about his leadership and whether it was to be
challenged.
The party conference in October would have been fetid with the various
factions planning and plotting, canvassing and campaigning. The
Euro-sceptics already have organised a large series of fringe meetings
to make the pressure on Mr Major even worse.
Mr Norman Lamont was certain to stand against him as a stalking horse
candidate 14 days after the start of the new session of Parliament.
The Prime Minister's analysis was that he had nothing to lose and
everything to gain by a bold stroke. So he resigns as leader and there
will be an election if anybody puts up against him on July 4.
His chances of success are high. His candidature is endorsed by every
member of the back-bench 1922 executive committee. His entire Cabinet is
supporting him, at least for the first ballot.
He has a campaign team -- Lord Cranborne, Leader in the Lords;
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang; Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney; and
Commons Leader Tony Newton -- up and running.
It was a big start that left his possible opponents gasping.
Ex-Chancellor Lamont was said to be looking particularly ''sick''. So
Major has been careful not to make the same mistake as Margaret
Thatcher, whose campaign was a muddle.
He is giving himself the best chance of being re-elected as leader.
Even Shadow Cabinet members are expecting him to win.
However, there will be a lot of hard thinking over this weekend among
the Tory MPs who will decide the issue. Critical to the issue is how the
60 key marginal members react.
Do they decide that this is their last chance to dump Mr Major and
find someone else more charismatic and more likely to help them hang on
to their seats at the next General Election? They will be talking to
their constituency associations before they decide.
Major supporters are adamant: ''If they want the best chance of
holding their seats, they've already got the man to do it,'' adding they
have ''got to put up or shut up. Now let's see what they're made of.
They know they are in for a trouncing.''
However, there are doubts already. Mr Major wants it sorted out once
and for all but his final humiliation might be that he wins but not with
a resounding victory. The prospect of more than 100 abstentions is
galling for his campaign managers.
Their line as they twist the arms is going to be: ''If we can't make
up our minds clearly about this unprecedented situation and this
unprecedented hounding of a party leader, then we might as well pack it
in. We would be no-hopers.''
However, this is a distinct possibility of sufficient abstentions to
force a second ballot on July 11. That would leave it open to any member
of the Cabinet -- including Michael Heseltine and Michael Portillo -- to
enter the election.
This is Mr Heseltine's last chance to assume the Premiership with
honour. He said he is supporting Mr Major and he did not qualify that,
but he did not have to.
Mr Portillo might feel that if it comes to a second ballot he has to
throw his hat in the ring to establish a leading position in a new
Cabinet. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke would have to feel the same way. Any
other Cabinet Minister who chose to stand would be regarded as an
also-ran.
Mr Major said yesterday that if he lost the election he would resign
as Prime Minister and support whoever was elected in his place. However,
if his victory in the first ballot was substantially less than glorious
he would remain a leader mortally wounded and subject to renewed attacks
from his enemies within the party.
In many ways, the worst result for the Prime Minister would be a
half-hearted one. It might even occasion another leadership election in
November. A first ballot winner has to achieve a majority of about 15%
of those who voted. If he only limps past this he could not claim that
the matter had been settled ''once and for all''.
Mr Tony Blair, already 39% ahead in the opinion polls, would be
delighted and the Tories could be heading for disaster at the next
General Election.
It is for this reason that Mr Major and his team have calculated that
this shock announcement would be a catalyst. The parliamentary party has
been alerted in the most dramatic way possible to the fact it is staring
over the abyss.
The Tory MPs have got to decide whether, in the famous words of the
last Labour Prime Minister, James Callaghan, they ''back him or sack
him''.

A LAWYER who took more than #39,000 of clients' money for his own use
has been struck off by the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal.
The tribunal decided that Michael Lindsay Snowie was not a fit and
proper person to remain a member of the legal profession.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, the tribunal stated that Mr
Snowie, 40, of Woodend Place, Aberdeen, became a solicitor in October
1982 and practised in the city.
On December 5, 1990, he took #21,600 from the account of husband and
wife clients without their consent to take up an electricity share offer
in the name of 13 of his family and friends.
Fifteen days later, he sold the shares and retained the proceeds for
himself.
In the case of three other clients, Mr Snowie misappropriated for his
own use sums of #4750, #4711, and #8207.
Mr Snowie also opened a fictitious bridging loan for #60,000 in the
name of one of his clients.
He explained to the tribunal that at first he took money from clients'
funds to meet oustanding interest payments. Later, he used his own money
to meet the liability of clients, which in turn caused him to draw on
clients' cash for personal spending.
The subscription for an electricity share offer was a ''misconceived
scheme'' with which Mr Snowie might have been able to clear his debts to
clients.
The tribunal was informed that the loss to clients had been cleared
from the proceeds of the sale of Mr Snowie's house and an advance from
his father, who had also been a solicitor.
It was also told that Mr Snowie no longer had a job and had suffered
significantly from publicity about his case.
The tribunal said it had been invited to limit Mr Snowie's penalty to
a suspension but had no alternative but to take a very serious view of
the misappropriation of clients' funds, as well as the opening of a
fictitious bridging loan.
''In the opinion of the tribunal, a solicitor who is responsible for
such conduct is not a fit and proper person to remain in that
profession.''
In a second case, the tribunal suspended Lanarkshire solicitor Cesidio
Martin Di Ciacca for two years.
Mr Di Ciacca, who now works as a consultant from Blairston Avenue,
Bothwell, was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court in April 1994 on a
summary complaint of defrauding the Inland Revenue. He was fined #2000.
Mr Di Ciacca told the discipline tribunal that the circumstances
leading to the conviction arose out of a personal transaction eight
years previously. Following the conviction, he resigned from his law
firm and began operating an advisory service to other legal firms.
The tribunal stated that any conviction of a solicitor for an act of
dishonesty was a very serious matter and the conduct which gave rise to
the conviction was a ''grave error of judgment''.
It said it ''drew marginally short'' of expelling Mr Di Ciacca from
the profession but the gravity of his conduct could be recognised only
by excluding him from practice for a significant period.
A third lawyer, Peter Lynch, of Waterloo Street, Glasgow, was limited
to acting as a qualified assistant for the next 10 years.
The discipline tribunal found him guilty of professional misconduct
for failing to comply with accounts rules and practising without either
insurance cover or a practising certificate.

NOT for the first time, Ireland could be the straw that helped to
break the British politician's political back.
Mr John Major fixed his colours to the mast -- if peace comes
permanently to Northern Ireland, much of the thanks will go to him.
He made the search for peace in Northern Ireland one of the central
planks of his Government. His resignation as Tory Party leader came
within hours of the Northern Ireland Secretary urging the party to stop
sniping at him or endanger the peace process.
After Sir Patrick Mayhew's appeal, Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis
said he had signed Mr Major's political death warrant.
''Mr Major will be away by the autumn,'' he said.
The Prime Minister has been back and forward to Belfast in the months
since the IRA called its ceasefire.
Announcements about shifts in the steps towards peace have been made
from Downing Street, emphasising Mr Major's control.
Eighteen months ago, he signed the Downing Street Declaration with the
then Irish Premier Albert Reynolds. It signalled what the British and
Irish Governments wanted, what the IRA could expect, and what they had
to do.
The terrorist ceasefire came almost nine months later and was followed
by the Framework Document, in which London and Dublin spelled out their
proposals for political development.
Unionists were outraged, withdrew their support for the Government,
and voted against it in the Commons -- but Labour backed the
Government's Northern Ireland policy, preventing a crisis.
Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, made a sortie into the Tory
leadership debate at the start of the week, when he said the peace
process was being sidelined by bickering within the Conservative Party.
''What is really happening is that the British Government are so
obsessed with their internal squabbling that it is very, very obvious
that they are not applying their minds to any problem, and particularly
our problem,'' he said.
The Rev Ian Paisley said last night that he thought it time for the
Prime Minister to bow out.
''I do hope there will be a complete change in the policy of the
Conservative Party. I do hope there will be a complete change in their
attitude to Northern Ireland and that this policy of surrender to the
IRA -- and giving in to murderers' ultimatum -- will cease,'' said the
DUP leader.
SDLP party chairman Mark Dirken said the peace process would not be
affected by Mr Major's resignation as Tory leader.
''I recall last November, when Albert Reynolds and his Government were
going through serious difficulty.
''I cautioned then that no Government should use the Northern Ireland
peace process as a political Get Out of Jail card to deal with their own
political difficulties, and that applies to this situation as well,'' he
said.
Mr Bertie Ahern, who leads Ireland's main opposition party Fianna
Fail, said on RTE: ''Whatever it does for domestic British politics, I
think it will be good for the peace process in this country, which is my
primary concern.''

<RECORDNO>977748211</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Environment Secretary, Mr John Gummer, angered by European
criticism of the cancelled plan to dump the Brent Spar oil platform at
sea, accused Denmark yesterday of being ''the dirty man of Europe''.
He said Denmark's rivers and lakes were so dirty that dogs had died
within minutes of drinking from them. He fiercely defended Britain's
record, saying it was ''in many ways the most environmentally friendly
nation in Europe''.
Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken dismissed Mr Gummer's remarks
as ''desperate''. ''Everybody knows that Denmark has a very high
standard of environment protection,'' he said.
Both Ministers were taking part in a meeting in Luxembourg of European
Union Environment Ministers.
Mr Gummer said some countries had not complained about the dumping
plan until the environmental activist group Greenpeace occupied the
Spar.
In remarks certain to anger at least the Danes, Mr Gummer singled out
Copenhagen, saying it had ''done more damage to the North Sea than I
think any other country. Denmark has so polluted her rivers and her
lakes that dogs have died within 10 minutes of drinking in them,'' he
told reporters.
He said more lead pollution was carried by German and Dutch rivers in
10 minutes than would have been caused by the Spar being sunk.
Denmark's Mr Auken was dismissive: ''It's so absurd that I think we
should forgive the man. He is in a difficult position. We still don't
want war with Britain.''

Major's decision to resign is unprecedented for the Conservatives,
writes Malcolm Dickson
DESPITE the rumours, despite his beleaguered position, John Major's
resignation as leader of the Conservative Party has still come as a
shock.
This resignation is unprecedented in the party as it precipitates a
leadership contest which is also a battle for No. 10 Downing Street.
Only since 1965 have leaders of the Conservative Party actually been
elected. Before that date leaders ''emerged'' after backroom
manoeuvring.
Indeed, the effective resignation of a sitting Prime Minister is also
relatively rare. However, in the space of eight years from 1955 to 1963,
three Conservative leaders did choose to go. In 1955, Anthony Eden
replaced Winston Churchill -- and went on to win the subsequent General
Election, increasing the Tory majority to 58.
Then, in 1957, Harold Macmillan replaced Eden. The following General
Election, in 1959, was won with a majority of 100. But when Alec
Douglas-Home took over from Macmillan in October 1963, one year later
Harold Wilson won the election for Labour, though with a majority of
only five.
John Major's momentous decision is similar to these previous
resignations in that he has chosen his time to do it. But it is also
very dissimilar, because he is seeking to be re-elected as leader and to
continue as Prime Minister.
Mr Major's case is also very different from the ousting of Margaret
Thatcher in 1990. Her departure was caused by a challenge not of her
choosing. Mrs Thatcher would have happily remained in office and in all
likelihood would have continued at least to the next General Election.
While the act of resignation in itself leaves the Conservatives with a
clear procedure of a leadership election, what is not clear is the
strategy that John Major is pursuing.
One interpretation is that an early ''clearing of the air'' is likely
to be his best hope for reviving Tory fortunes in the run-up to the next
General Election. Politicians are not noted for their willingness to
throw their party into turmoil immediately before an election; they like
to resolve these issues well away from the ballot box, and particularly
in opposition.
Another factor may be that the potential new challengers to Mr Major
(such as Michael Portillo) are generally seen, even by their own
supporters, as being not quite ready for the highest office. John Major
may feel that if he is to win a leadership contest, then now is the best
time before his rivals become even stronger.
In electoral terms it is important for a political party to be seen to
be united in the sense of its key figures pulling in the same direction.
It is hard to imagine that the resignation of a party's leader to pick,
in effect, a fight with his detractors will do anything to solve the
underlying weaknesses of that party's electoral position.
If Mr Major were to win the contest it would undoubtedly strengthen
his position, both within Parliament, and perhaps more crucially, among
his party's supporters. Yet this is a high risk strategy, and is not
likely to improve the Conservatives' electoral fortunes in the long
term. Ultimately, Government failings are not simply down to the Prime
Minister of the day. Mr Major's problems are symptoms of a deeper
malaise within the Parliamentary Conservative Party.
How are these problems to be resolved? One thing is clear. Mr Major is
deeply unpopular. His Government is even more so. In Mori and Gallup
polls in recent months, Mr Major actually achieves a higher satisfaction
rating than his administration.
But here is the crunch. None of his likely successors can achieve
substantially higher ratings. Michael Heseltine is likely to come
closest, but both Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo fail to deliver in
the eyes of the of the British electorate.
If Mr Major's resignation is designed to benefit his party rather than
himself personally, then again there is little evidence that any new
leader is going to make a significant impact. Of course, both Mr
Portillo and -- especially -- Mr Heseltine would benefit from some type
of honeymoon effect. If this proves to be the case, then that new leader
would be well advised to use that brief period and call a swift General
Election.
It is by no means certain that any of the supposed obvious
replacements will actually stand. This may be another part of John
Major's thinking. If no election were actually to take place, because no
one was willing to stand, then Mr Major might just buy himself enough
time. However, this scenario is also not likely to improve Tory
fortunes.
If we view popularity and unity as crucial, then the Tories are not
going to look any better after this leadership contest. The party is
likely to continue to be split, whoever takes the reins. Recent analysis
indicates that if the Tories are to have any chance of success at the
next General Election, then a new leader would have to be twice to three
times as popular as John Major. This also assumes that economic
circumstances are rosy and that the popularity of Government policy
stages a comeback.
John Major is a brave Premier. He has lasted longer than the four-year
average of post-war Prime Ministers. Many may consider him weak, but he
has proved time and again that he is prepared to fight. This time, it is
not only his political life he is fighting for, but also his party's
future fortunes.
Perhaps the words of Winston Churchill will ultimately prove to be too
close to home for John Major. When speaking about the office of Prime
Minister, Sir Winston said: ''The loyalties which centre upon No.1 are
enormous. If he trips he must be sustained. If he makes mistakes they
must be covered. If he sleeps he must not be wantonly disturbed.
''If he is no good, he must be pole-axed.''

Brussels
EARLIER this year, during a routine bout of Tory infighting over
Europe, John Major sat down privately with his Foreign Secretary and
political confidante, Douglas Hurd.
The troubled Prime Minister wanted to review the continuing agony of
the Tories over Europe and to discuss what, if anything, could be done
to resolve their misery.
Mr Major needed the counsel of the ultimate Tory grandee and the
Cabinet's reputedly safest pair of hands. Mr Hurd is, of course, a
European and he is also a Major loyalist, although the two have had a
sometimes strained relationship as the Prime Minister sought to appease
the Euro-sceptics.
When the two met, it was clear the Conservative Party was now
irreconcilably divided on Britain's future role in Europe and that their
dwindling Commons majority was fast approaching the point where it would
no longer guarantee survival for the Government's natural life.
Something had to be done.
Major and Hurd together worked out a seminal speech which the Prime
Minister delivered in the House of Commons on March 1. It is now
regarded as a sacred text.
Previous speeches -- such as Major's hardline comments earlier in
Leiden, in the Netherlands, against more EU integration -- are nowadays
dismissively referred to even by the most senior politicians as ''the
apocrypha''.
In other words, Major has finally accepted he cannot hope to please
both sides in the Tories' division over Europe and has made it known he
will let his comments on March 1 stand as his European testament. They
must take it or leave it.
The March speech is a typical Major effort, too grudgingly European
for the Euro-enthusiasts and a traitorous abandonment of sovereignty for
the Euro-sceptics. Indeed, some of the sceptics have since come clean
and admitted their ultimate objective now is total withdrawal of the
United Kingdom from the European Union.
The speech made several explicit points:
* Britain will support eastward expansion of the EU because an
enlarged community of perhaps 25 or so states is ''bound to be more
flexible and less prescriptive'' than the original EEC. In other words,
Britain sees no threat from a future superstate.
* Britain will work at next year's Maastricht review conference to
develop a common foreign and security policy -- while resisting majority
voting -- and to ensure subsidiarity (Euro-jargon for devolution from
Brussels) is increased.
* There should be more power, not less, for national parliaments.
* Defence will remain a matter for decisions by EU governments, not a
new power for ''Brussels''.
* Existing border controls will be maintained.
* Voting procedures should provide more power to the bigger states
like Britain. ''We shall not accept the end of the national veto or
significant constitutional change that would impact adversely on this
House,'' Major pledged.
Of all the Tory disputes and debates about Europe's future, the most
potentially explosive, for any British government, is economic and
monetary union (Emu) and the proposed single European currency.
Major has stuck to his pledge to take a raincheck on Britain joining.
In this he has been helped significantly in the past few days by the
admission by EU finance ministers that the scheduled move in 1997 to the
next stage of Emu must almost certainly be postponed for two years.
In other words, Major could finding himself fighting a General
Election, if he survives as Tory leader, without having to make up his
mind about joining Emu. A referendum on the issue could be called.
However, for most Tories -- and most Tories are still pro-Europe --
the fact that Major has at last called the bluff of his enemies by
telling them to put up or shut up is music to their ears. Whether it
will really solve the Tories' death wish on Europe is an other matter.
* Mrs Pauline Green, the British Labour Euro-MP who leads the European
Parliament's powerful socialist group, yesterday accused Mr Major of a
''further squalid attempt to cling to power'' and of damaging the best
interest of Britain and Europe.
She said: ''The Prime Minister has opted for a living death over the
next few months. He will be powerless to act and held in contempt by all
around him. Britain will be denied a government, Europe will be denied a
partner and our peoples will once again be cheated by his coward's way
out.
''Mr Major should go now and take his party with him.''

The Government will block permission for Shell to dispose of Brent
Spar onshore in Britain if the oil company fails to prove that the
65,000-ton installation and its polluted sludge can be treated safely.
Still visibly angry at Shell's abrupt decision not to proceed with the
sinking of Brent Spar in the North Atlantic, Mr Major attacked the
company for caving in to ''misguided pressure'' from environmental
groups and foreign countries.
There will be ''a price to pay'', Mr Major warned MPs, for the
company's reversal in the face of sustained pressure from environmental
activists and foreign countries.
He warned that the Government was under no obligation to grant a
licence, an essential step before the disused facility can be brought
ashore. His determination not to be pushed into reversing his belief
that sinking is the best option puts pressure on Britain's critics
elsewhere in Europe to come up with a site.
The issue was raised during Prime Minister's Questions by Labour's Dr
Norman Godman, MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow, who said speculation in
Scotland pointed to the lower Clyde as an eventual destination for the
rig: ''If that is the case, will you give an assurance that all safety
regulations will be adhered to?''
Later, Dr Godman said a possible site was the former Scott-Lithgow
yard on the Clyde now owned by Trafalgar House, raising the possibility
of jobs being created to carry out the work.
''Provided I can be reassured on all safety aspects, both for the
fishing grounds and onshore, I would be willing to see the work of
dismantling done in Scotland,'' he said.
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond accused the Prime Minister
of displaying ''foot-stamping petulance'' in the face of his
''humiliation'' at the hands of Shell, and called on him to consider
appointing an independent authority to oversee decommissioning.
Mr Major rejected his suggestion: ''I am not entirely sure whether the
people of Scotland will draw the conclusion that I draw -- that the SNP
would like Brent Spar to be disposed of on land in Scotland at the
expense of British and Scottish taxpayers.
''If that is your message, I hope you will take it to every household
you have deceived at recent elections.''

and Stornoway are earmarked for possible closure, management told the
Civil and Public Services Association and National Union of Civil and
Public Servants yesterday. More than 30 jobs are at risk.
Mr Geelan said the withdrawal of frontline cover from so many miles of
coast would hit anti-drug operations in particular.
Offices in Oban and Ullapool are guaranteed under the review,
according to the unions, but they fear that vast stretches between
Dumfries, Ayr, and Oban will be unwatched.
The number of anti-smuggling officers is to be reduced by 550 across
the UK under Government spending cuts.
Unions suspect that only 72 officers will be left to cover the 7000
miles of Scottish coastline at a time when drugs-related deaths are
escalating.
However, the new head of Customs and Excise in Scotland has forecast
better performances despite the swingeing cuts made under the
Government's review of Civil Service jobs.
Mr Campbell Arnott believes more revenue will be collected, and
successes against smuggling increase, regardless of the near 25% cut in
jobs over the next five years.

THE agreement struck between the Community and Mental Health Services
Trust and Miller Partnerships will increase the value of the site and
secure the future of its two listed buildings, said Mr Andrew Robertson,
chairman of the trust.
''We might have got #2m if we had put the whole lot up for sale and
walked away from our responsibilities -- this is a seven to eight year
plan from which we will get significantly more in the long run,'' he
said.
If the site had been sold off as one, they could have been left with
the situation that has arisen in England after the large-scale closure
of asylums, with historic buildings lying derelict all over the country.
''They were able to sell the land but not the buildings,'' said Mr Tim
Davison, the chief executive. ''We did try to market the site as a whole
but the only interest we got was from companies who wanted to
cherry-pick the best sites.''
Instead, the development will be progressive, with funds realised from
the sale of housing land being used to mothball properly the two empty
listed buildings on the site until the development reaches them.
Four developers were on the trust's short leet before Edinburgh-based
Miller Partnerships secured the joint venture agreement, believed to be
the first of its kind in Scotland.
Miller Partnerships, part of the Miller Group, said yesterday that the
developments could cost between #35m and #50m if the full potential was
realised.
Up to 400 houses could go on the 178-acre site, ranging in price from
#40,000 to more than #100,000. Some will be built for rent. Shops will
also be provided. The nine-golf course could possibly become an 18-hole
course.
Proposed options under study for the Grade A listed Tower View include
a hotel, country club, and extensions for tertiary education centres.
There is also strong nursing home interest in the site.

<HEADLINE>Attack by Lamont signals he could be ready to fight</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORMER Chancellor Norman Lamont has launched an attack on Mr Major
that was being seen at Westminster last night as a clear signal he is
ready for a fight.
In an article for the Times today -- written before the Prime
Minister's resignation as party leader -- Mr Lamont claimed he stopped
Mr Major locking the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism.
He accused the Government of adopting an ''unconvincing'' attitude to
the problem posed by the single currency and warned the country was in
danger of ''sleepwalking'' into monetary union.
Mr Lamont, sacked by Mr Major after the value of the pound collapsed
on Black Wednesday in September 1992, is widely seen as the most likely
initial opponent in a leadership contest.
He arrived home in Notting Hill, West London, last night amid scenes
of confusion.
Reporters and cameramen pressed around to ask whether he intended to
stand against Mr Major in the leadership election.
As they did so, media crews crashed through the gate of the
mid-terraced home, knocking the gate off its hinges.
In the newspaper interview, Mr Lamont effectively claimed credit for
the economic recovery -- and the pound's opt-out from a single currency
-- in the face of opposition from the Prime Minister.
''No-one understands the need for an opt-out better than myself, for I
negotiated it with the Prime Minister's support,'' he wrote.
''The only time he intervened in the negotiations was when he wished
to make Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism a legally
binding obligation. I refused to go along with that.''
He said the Government must take the lead in resisting steps to a
federal Europe.
TORY Euro-sceptic MPs last night gave no immediate public indication
about their tactics in the leadership contest.
Six leading party rebels -- Sir Richard Body, Nick Budgen, Christopher
Gill, Tony Marlow, Richard Shepherd and Sir Teddy Taylor -- were on
their way to address a ''realist Euro rally'' in Malvern,
Worcestershire, when the Downing Street announcement came.
About 1000 people packed last night's meeting but as they streamed in
the only topic of conversation was the leadership contest.
The audience warmly applauded the Euro-sceptics, who kept to prepared
speeches tackling issues like Brussels bureaucracy and their opposition
to the single currency.
Mr Marlow said after the meeting: ''John Major is a nice guy, but he's
a loser.
''The decisions will be taken next week as to who should stand (in a
leadership contest), but I believe it is absolutely vital that somebody
does stand, and there is a proper election.''
Sir Teddy Taylor said after the rally that Mr Major would continue to
have his support.
''I just think it is sad that this contest has been called. It just
makes it more difficult for the party to solve its problems and to get
the support of the people,'' said Sir Teddy.
In platform speeches and answers to questions at the rally there was
no mention of Mr Major's bombshell which took organisers completely by
surprise.
Organised by two local farmers, the rally was staged under the banner:
''Europe -- the battle for Britain''.
Mr Gill told the audience: ''By your very presence here this evening
you are sending a powerful message which ministers ignore at their
peril.''
He said no-one could deny that it was the issue of ''who governs
Britain?'' that had brought so many to the meeting to question Euro
interference, red tape and threats to British jobs.

EDINBURGH District Council is to put pressure on Scottish Opera to
drop its opposition to other touring opera companies appearing at the
city's cash-strapped Festival Theatre.
The council's Labour recreation convener Steve Cardownie warned
yesterday that the company's attitude was bound to be remembered when
the council next came to discuss its annual grant to Scottish Opera.
All-party anger was expressed at the policy and resources committee
over the effect of the ''sphere's of influence'' policy operated by the
Arts Council and adhered to by Scottish Opera, under which a resident
opera company is seen to have a role in shaping all professional opera
activity in a given area.
A report by executive recreation director Robert Jones said:
''Scottish Opera has objected to visiting opera companies appearing at
both the Festival Theatre and King's Theatre. Discussions are currently
taking place between the Festival Theatre and Scottish Opera in an
attempt to resolve the issue.''
Liberal Democrat leader Donald Gorrie told the committee it was
''quite scandalous'' that Scottish Opera could act in this way.
He said he believed Scottish Opera was mistaken in thinking it would
lose audiences if top English opera companies came to the city. The
Festival Theatre had built up an audience for dance and could do the
same for opera, given the chance.
The council will now write to Scottish Opera, emphasising that its #5m
stake in the showpiece theatre was made on the understanding that
visiting opera companies would be a regular feature of its programme.
Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, told the Herald
this week that the Arts Council policy allowed each company a designated
sphere of influence and was designed to avoid repertoire and performance
clashes.
There was also general support from the committee for a suggestion
from Tory councillor Brian Meek that the new city council should
consider setting up a separate sub-committee to oversee its theatres
policy.
He said the council was a major player in this field. In view of the
economic impact that theatregoers had on the city, money from the
economic development budget as well as the recreation one should go
towards supporting theatrical ventures.

A LOOPHOLE in the law that has led to high street stores selling kits
for growing cannabis was challenged by Strathclyde Police and
councillors in a campaign launched yesterday.
The Cut the Grass initiative, launched by Strathclyde Regional Council
convener Mr Bill Perry, comes after undercover officers from the
council's consumer and trading standards department discovered the
merchandise was available in more than 20 shops, mainly selling records
or clothes.
The equipment included cannabis seeds and literature on their
cultivation, sold alongside pipes, scales, and extra long cigarette
papers commonly used for cannabis.
Although growing, possessing, and dealing in the drug is prohibited in
criminal law, the legal practice of selling such products was condemned
by Mr Perry and senior policemen for promoting to the public,
particularly young people, that drug use was acceptable.
Outlets targeted include the high street stores Tower Records, which
was found selling cannabis cultivation manuals, and Flip American
Clothing, whose Glasgow shop has withdrawn cannabis seeds and literature
from its shelves in response to the campaign.

FLIES may have contributed to the train crash in Kent last October
which killed five people and injured 12 others, an entomologist has
claimed.
The accident happened when two trains collided in thick fog on a
single-line stretch of track near Cowden.
The driver of the north-bound train, who died in the crash, was blamed
in the inquiry report published earlier this month for driving into the
single-track sector against a red light.
However, in a report in the New Scientist, entomologist Clive Boase,
describes finding 70 dead flies in the casing behind the red light.
Forensic investigators told the inquiry they had encountered a waxy
substance formed by the flies' droppings over the inside of the lens.
Optical tests, described at the inquiry, showed that the signal was
only producing 13.6% of the light produced by a comparable used light
from storage.
Mr Boase also believes the flies would swarm inside the red rather
than the green signal because danger was the default position and the
bulb would be warm.
The report adds that British Rail believed fly faeces played only a
minor part in dimming the bulb and blamed tungsten deposits built up
over time.

Meanwhile, grassroots Conservatives in Edinburgh pledged to back Mr
Major to the hilt, writes Lynn Roertson.
Edinburgh District Council Group Leader, Councillor Daphne Sleigh said
she wholeheartedly supported the Prime Minister.
''I am extremely confident that Mr Major will win. I think it is
appalling that he has been forced into this disgraceful situation and
most unedifying for the Conservative Party. I hope that his bravery and
strength in standing up to it and facing it will see an end to it,'' she
said.
Fellow Edinburgh councillor Mrs Moira Knox said she had been a member
of the Conservative Party for 50 years and had been angered by the
whispering campaign against the leader from other factions in the party.
''I have never wavered in my support for the party, but I am so near
now. I am so fed up. That poor man. He's been doing his best and he gets
credit for nothing,'' she said.
Vice-president of the Edinburgh West Conservative Association, Mr
Gordon Snowden -- who helped engineer Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's
success in the last election -- said he had predicted Mr Major's
resignation two years ago.
The leading party worker has gained a reputation within the party for
his accuracy in political predictions and said he believed the Prime
Minister would be re-elected.
''The situation became impossible for the Prime Minister. Quite
resolute action was required. He has been very brave and I am sure he
will win. We are backing him to the hilt and no-one else.''

A MAJOR housing and leisure development costing up to #50m is planned
for the grounds of Leverndale psychiatric hospital in Glasgow, which is
to shed 264 beds over the next two years.
More than 100 acute and intensive psychiatric care beds are to go from
the hospital with the building of a new unit at Victoria Infirmary.
The Glasgow Community and Mental Health Services Trust said yesterday
this would provide a better spread of acute services and the local
health council welcomed the introduction of a service which the
south-east of the city had been seeking for more than 20 years.
With the south-west served by psychiatric beds at the Southern
General, the development will also provide acute psychiatric care at the
district general hospital serving each locality. Also affected will be
the continuing care services for adults and the elderly -- 140 beds will
go by 1997, with the future of the remaining 177 to be the subject of
long-term review with other agencies.
The proposals are contained in a consultation paper on mental health
services for South Glasgow, issued jointly by the trust and Greater
Glasgow Health Board, with three months for responses before a final
decision is made.
Leverndale has 465 beds, comprising 60 adult and 60 elderly acute, 12
intensive care, 16 rehabilitation, and 157 adult and 160 elderly
long-stay. The new unit planned for the Victoria will have 60 adult and
40 elderly acute, and 15 intensive care. The Southern General will
continue to have 60 adult acute, and elderly acute beds will increase
from 25 to 50.
The reduction in continuing care beds for adult and elderly patients
-- a total of 467 in the South Side -- will begin this year. Sixty will
go completely and the funds released will be used to finance three
additional resource centres.
Next year, Leverndale will lose 80, of which 20 will go outright, with
the rest being transferred to alternative NHS provision.
In addition, 60 mental health beds for the elderly at Darnley Court
will be re-designated for care of the elderly and the funding
transferred to social work.
Leverndale employs the equivalent of 576 full-time staff. Many will
transfer directly to the Victoria unit and other posts, leaving a net
reduction of 170 jobs, of whom 60 would be needed for community health
teams. They expect any job losses to be met by natural wastage,
voluntary severance, or early retirement.
Mr Dave Watson, regional officer of the health union Unison, welcomed
the proposal to retain part of Leverndale -- a few weeks ago outright
closure was being suggested -- but condemned the long-term continuing
care plans as vague and founded on guesswork.
He also criticised the emphasis on locating acute psychiatry care in
general hospitals. ''That is being seen as outmoded,'' he said. ''People
are now questioning whether it is a good thing to treat mentally-ill
people in the bustling atmosphere of a general hospital. We don't want
to go back to the old institutions but somewhere with some greenery
round it is far more relaxing and therapeutic.''

A PAINTER and decorator, who terrified women by appearing at their
bedsides after sneaking into their homes under cover of darkness, was
jailed for four years yesterday.
In one case, Colin Farrer's victim woke up to find him lying on the
bed beside her wearing a mask. He then assaulted her with intent to rape
her.
The offences took place in Aberdeen between September 1, 1989, and
February 4, 1994.
Farrer, 37, c/o Walker Place, Torry, Aberdeen, had pled guilty at the
High Court in Aberdeen to five charges of breach of the peace involving
entering houses under cover of darkness and placing the occupants in a
state of fear and alarm.
A jury found him guilty of assaulting a 22-year-old secretary with
intent to rape but another charge of carrying out a sex attack at
knifepoint on a 21-year-old woman in her bedroom was found not proven.
Lord Kirkwood had deferred sentence to the High Court in Edinburgh for
social work and psychiatric reports.
Yesterday, Mrs Mhairi Richards, defence counsel, said the offences had
a number of common elements. All of the women were known to the accused,
Farrer appeared to have been drinking at the time, and there was a
marked lack of persistence in each case.
As far as the assault with intent to rape was concerned, Farrer had
denied that charge but now admitted the possibility that he was the
person who committed the offence.
Although it must have been a terrifying experience for the woman,
there was none of the kind of violence that was sometimes associated
with offences of this kind. The offences came to light after the victim
of the incident on February 4 reported it to police.
Mrs Richards said there was nothing in the psychiatric report to
indicate he was a danger to the public or to women.
According to the social work report, Farrer had turned to drink and
drugs after his second marriage collapsed. He was drinking a colossal
and dangerous amount of alcohol. He was also abusing drugs.
The social worker had taken the view that the accused was someone who
might commit offences of this kind again but there was nothing in the
psychiatric report to indicate this.
Mrs Richards told the court that Farrer had been kept in protective
custody while in prison. Cuttings of newspaper reports of the case had
been placed under his door with the threat that he would be slashed.
Lord Kirkwood said he took a serious view of the offences, in
particular the charge of assault with intent to rape. It was perfectly
clear that the women were placed in a state of fear and alarm.

five of her other children.
Patricia Brentrup has accused their father and her former partner of
abandoning the family home and trying to hurt her by threatening the
film careers of the child star and his 12-year-old brother Kieran. The
order covers six of the seven children, barring their 19-year-old
eldest, and will remove the need for Kieran to have his father's consent

POLITICAL opponents of the Government in Scotland were quick to claim
that the Tory leadership crisis meant the electorate now had to be given
its chance to cast its own verdict at the ballot box.
Labour, SNP, and Liberal Democrats all called for a General Election.
However, Mr Major's political allies insisted he was making a
courageous political stand in which victory could bring much-needed
stability to the country.
Scottish Conservative chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, said: ''The
decision to force a leadership election is not only courageous but is in
the best interests of the party and Government.
''Nothing could be more damaging than another four months of sniping
against the Prime Minister, had he decided to soldier on until November
when the rules would have allowed a contest.
''The Scottish party will now have the opportunity to show its support
for the Prime Minister in the event of there being a contested election.
Now is the time for his critics to put up -- or shut up. I personally
look forward to working with the Prime Minister to win the next General
Election.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang will also be closely involved with Mr
Major as a leading member of his campaign team in the leadership fight.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson had just finished presiding
over the first meeting of the Scottish Industry Forum, a Labour
organised grouping intended to wean the business community on to the
idea of a Government led by Mr Tony Blair.
He had told these leaders of Scottish industry that Labour was
preparing to take power. Within an hour of the conference in Edinburgh's
George Hotel drawing to a close, British politics were back in the
melting point, and Mr Robertson was quick to suggest that Mr Major's
election battle took Labour a step closer to power.
''We have had an excellent day of discussion with industrial leaders
in Scotland preparing for a Labour Government and rebuilding the economy
and social fabric of this country,'' he said.
''Tonight's developments show that this Government is unfit to run the
country and incapable of improving the lives of the people of Scotland.
''This is a desperate act by a desperate man and, given the degree of
failure of the Scottish Conservatives in recent years, it is astonishing
that the man responsible for that failure is likely to run John Major's
election campaign.
''This Government is finished. Scotland deserves better.''
However, leading Tories -- including some of Mr Major's supposed
critics and allies of potential opponents -- rallied round. Leading
right winger Michael Forsyth, presumed to be an ally of Mr Michael
Portillo, predicted a clear win for the Prime Minister.
He said: ''He is going to do more than survive. He is going to prosper
and go on to win the next General Election.''
This optimistic assessment was endorsed by Ayr MP Phil Gallie, who was
delighted Mr Major had seized the initiative on the issue and taken the
battle to his critics.
However, a note of caution was sounded by Mr Bill Walker, MP for
Tayside North, and a strong critic of the Government. He described the
move as ''very dangerous and very high risk'' but added ''the rewards
could be enormous if he pulls it off''.
Mr Walker, who has not been slow to criticise his leader on European
and other matters, said Mr Major could count on his support because he
felt the Prime Minister had moved sufficiently on the key issues.
The SNP insisted that Mr Major was mortally wounded, his party no
longer fit to govern.
''What matters is not who has the confidence of the Tory Party but who
has the confidence of Scotland,'' party leader Alex Salmond said. ''For
that reason, what we require is not a Tory election but a General
Election.''
He claimed his party's victory in Perth and Kinross had fatally
wounded Mr Major's leadership and a General Election may now be
inevitable and, as such, he was placing his party on full war-footing,
ready for the contest, should it come.
''We are now in the last desperate days of this discredited and
anti-Scottish Government,'' he said. ''We are therefore on the threshold
of a fresh start for Scotland.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace called the leadership
poll ''an admission of the disunited shambles in which the Tory Party
finds itself''.
He added: ''We don't need a contest for the leadership of the Tory
Party. If John Major had real guts we could have a contest for the
leadership of the nation -- let him call a General Election.''
There was support for Mr Major from the director general of the
Scottish Chambers of Commerce. Mr Charles Winter said this courageous
move would prevent opposition building up over the summer months.

<HEADLINE>Waldegrave hails animal exports deal New regulations unlikely to pacify militant campaigners seeking an end to shipments</HEADLINE>

TALKS in Brussels yesterday brought agreement on Europewide animal
transport regulations which should ease disruption to the Scottish live
export trade.
Exporters will rely on the new rules to satisfy animal welfare
campaigners and ferry companies which for months have been unwilling to
risk live animal shipments because of the public outcry.
However, it is doubtful if the regulations will be enough to pacify
militant animal rights groups which have threatened to continue protests
until the live trade is halted for good.
Agriculture Minister William Waldergrave hailed the agreement despite
misgivings by representatives from Austria, Sweden, and Denmark who said
the journey limits were too lax.
''This is the historic beginning of proper legislation to improve the
treatment of animals in transport,'' Mr Waldergrave said as he left the
talks.
He said the agreement included enforcement measures and penalties such
as loss of licence for hauliers found flouting the rules. Inspections to
insure compliance with obligatory journey plans would be rigorous.
''Cowboys have something to fear,'' Mr Waldergrave said.
The deal which broke a two-year negotiation deadlock is for a basic
eight-hour journey limit which can be extended to 28 hours if specially
equipped lorries with facilities for on-board feeding, watering, and air
conditioning are used.
Limits on journeys made on such vehicles will vary depending on the
type and age of animal.
Calves and lambs can be transported for up 18 hours with a one-hour
break halfway for food and water. Older animals may travel for 28 hours
with a one-hour break midway while pigs, known to become aggressive
during stops, can be transported for 24 hours.
A rest of at least 24 hours is compulsory for all animals before the
journey cycle can be repeated.
Sea trips will be counted for the purposes of calculating journey
times and animals arriving at continental ports will have to be rested
at nearby lairages on arrival.
Rules will have to be enforced by the end of 1998 at the latest.
The agricultural ministers also wrapped up agreement on the level of
EU farm price support for the coming year, dropping plans for a 2% cut
in butter prices and agreeing to consider a reduction in the compulsory
set-aside rate before the end of next month.
Robert Ross writes: The proposals on transport of animals drew
qualified approval from all parties yesterday.
The Meat and Livestock Commission estimated that most places in Europe
would still be accessible but warned that upgrading of vehicles and
lowering of the numbers which could be carried would lead to increased
costs.
Mr Jim Morris, chief executive of the Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, suggested that the added costs might
make the trade uneconomic and bring it to an end.
Mr Colin McLean, chief executive of the Meat and Livestock Commission,
said the new limits could create problems for transporters collecting
animals from a number of different farms.
The meter would start running from the time of the first uplift. That
could make significant inroads where an eight-hour restriction applied.
He accepted that transport operators would be faced with significant
additional costs.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland welcomed the introduction of
uniform rules which could be policed but warned that Scotland's hill and
island farmers must not be put at a disadvantage.
One area of confusion centred on the position of stock from the
Scottish islands and whether they would have to be ''rested'' as soon as
they reached the mainland.
Mr Jim Budge, junior vice-president of Shetland NFU, said he was
waiting for written confirmation from the Scottish Office that livestock
on the 14-hour voyage from Lerwick to Aberdeen would be exempt from the
new regulations which ban journeys of more than eight hours apart from
exceptional circumstances.

MILAN: The entire board of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's
advertising company, Publitalia, has resigned after a corruption
investigation into their business activities. Members include two of
Berlusconi's children, Marina and Piersilvio. The mass resignation is a
tactic to head off any move by magistrates to put the agency into court
administration.

THE Scottish Select Committee yesterday released a damning report on
the future of psychiatric hospitals in Scotland.
The report addresses the current levels of psychiatric bed provision,
the needs of those now living in the community, and the planning and
financial mechanisms which underpin the shift to community provision.
The committee chairman, Labour MP Willie McKelvey, said: ''We are
concerned at the lack of information on bed numbers and we call on the
Scottish Office to identify which long-stay beds are for
psycho-geriatric patients and which are for continuing care.
''Bed occupancy rates of over 100% have led to a situation in which,
according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 'You have to be
seriously ill, you have to be a risk to yourself or others to get in'.''
Mr McKelvey said evidence also had been presented of consultants
feeling pressurised to discharge individuals prematurely. Although
Government policy clearly said the decision to discharge was a clinical
one, it appeared that efficiency savings would be made simply by closing
beds.
The committee pointed out that wholesale bed closure would require the
provision of support within the community for individuals with complex
support needs. Where the Health Service had traditionally provided
respite care, the Scottish Office must ensure that health boards did not
unilaterally withdraw after-care services without first having resources
transferred from local authority funds.
Mr McKelvey said: ''There appears to be a considerable variation in
the joint working of health and social work authorities. A
carrot-and-stick approach involving financial incentives has been used
to bring health and social work authorities together.
''But concerns were expressed that health boards were producing joint
purchasing agreements before their strategies were in place. In such
cases, strategy was determined by purchasing decisions rather than the
reverse.'' The logic of joint planning should be extended to the
production of joint mental health strategies.
Mr McKelvey and the committee consider that the Scottish Office policy
which dictates that strategy is best left to local agencies is wrong and
say local strategies should be based on a framework laid down by the
Scottish Office.
The MPs consider that the variation in the planning cycles of many of
the agencies involved in community care causes major difficulties. They
say the Scottish Office must simplify the relationship between financial
planning cycles and the mechanisms for the agencies involved.
As far as the committee is concerned, NHS services remain free but
where a person stays in the community, the social care costs fall either
on the local authority or, increasingly, on the individual concerned and
his or her family.
Mr McKelvey said: ''The distinction is in many ways invidious. If your
kidneys fail or your liver fails you get NHS care, but if your brain
fails slowly you have to pay for social care.''
Last night, Mr Andrew Welsh, SNP representative on the Scottish
Affairs Committee, said: ''The issue of adequate funding for local
authorities and the Mental Welfare Committee must be addressed. I would
recommend that the Government takes a new look at its Care in the
Community policy and acts against the problems it has caused.''
The Scottish Assocation for Mental Health strongly endorsed the report
and called on the Scottish Office to implement its recommendations
urgently.
However, SAMH principal officer Claire Walker regretted the committee
had not accepted SAMH's plea for mental health education to be made a
priority for the Health Education Board for Scotland.
''Sadly, tremendous stigma still adheres to mental health problems and
health education in this area would go some way to shifting the
stigma,'' she said.

SHIRLEY MacRae was 20 weeks' pregnant when she was told she had cancer
of the bowel. Doctors offered her a termination to save her own life.
Mrs MacRae declined the offer and tomorrow she will celebrate the
first birthday of Samantha, when the family set out on holiday to
France. Mother and daughter are both fit and well.
''I was devastated when the doctor told me I had cancer,'' Mrs MacRae,
28, from Muir of Ord, Ross-shire, said yesterday. ''The first thing
everybody thinks when they hear that they have cancer is 'I am going to
die'. But I was determined that I would not die.''
Mrs MacRae opted to carry her baby until doctors at Raigmore Hospital,
Inverness, decided the risk to her own life was impossibly high.
Samantha was delivered by caesarian section 10 weeks prematurely, and
Mrs MacRae spent the next week in a cancer ward at the opposite end of
the hospital.
She fought through the operation on her life-threatening cancer, a
bout of pneumonia, and doubts over the health of Samantha, who weighed
3lb 10oz at birth. The baby was given a 50-50 chance of survival and
spent her first three weeks in an incubator.
Mrs MacRae, whose husband, Ally, is a car mechanic, has two other
children, Liam, seven, and Barry, four.

<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday faced a barrage of criticism over
radical education plans which would ''abolish'' grant-maintained
schools.
Labour's new policy, condemned as a U-turn by critics, proposes three
types of schools: community, aided, and foundation.
All would have greater financial delegation of their budgets than the
present 85%, but all -- including the former opt-out schools -- would
have local authority representatives appointed to their boards of
governors.
There would also be an extension of parent power, with more parents on
all governing bodies and strengthened rights for parents in admission
appeals.
Heading the criticism yesterday was former Labour deputy leader Roy
Hattersley, who condemned the reforms as a betrayal of Socialist
principles, designed to ''appease a small group of the suburban middle
classes''.
He also made a thinly veiled attack on Mr Blair, who has decided to
send his son, Euan, eight miles across London to the opt-out London
Oratory School.
Mr Hattersley said the creation of new ''foundation schools'' to take
the place of grant-maintained schools, with reduced but still
considerable freedom from council control, amounted to an ''endorsement
of a two-tier education system''.
However, Mr Blair, who launched Labour's schools policy yesterday
alongside Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett, said: ''He is
wrong. He is quite wrong.''
The party leader told journalists that Labour's new system would offer
''diversity, choice, exellence, and high standards for all''.
He added: ''That is the essence of the best of the comprehensive
system, that doesn't divide children into successes and failures at the
age of 11.
''But there has to be a place for diversity within that system.''
Mr Blair said Labour unashamedly refused to reject all of the
Government's education reforms.
''We seek to build sensibly on what is in place. We keep what is good
and working. We change what isn't.''
However, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard claimed Labour's
education policies were in disarray.
''Labour's education policy is now in utter confusion and it is in
confusion because basically what David Blunkett is attempting to do is
to reconcile the irreconcilable,'' she said.
In the Commons, the Prime Minister said: ''The proposals the Labour
Party have produced today are very badly named.
''Hypocrisy and Mediocrity should have been the title of their
plans.''
Mr Major added: ''I support the right of every parent in the country
to choose the appropriate school for their child.
''I just wish some of those who exercise the choice themselves would
ensure it remains equally free for every other parent in the land.''

A LABOUR VIEW
I HAPPENED to be within earshot of one of Mr Major's more intractable
opponents, as news came through of the Downing Street statement. ''Isn't
he brave,'' he sneered. ''But isn't he stupid.''
As Tory loyalists queued to tell the cameras of Mr Major's ''bravery''
in reapplying for his own job, without adding the less complimentary
part of the assessment, my confidence grew that this is too clumsy a
manoeuvre to be regarded as a master-stroke.
The likelihood, one way or another, is that Mr Major will continue as
leader of the Tory Party. So what does that solve? The certainty is that
his enemies within will continue to act on the basis of long-term
tactical calculation, which is incompatible with party unity.
If they calculate that a candidate in these contrived circumstances is
likely to be heavily defeated, then they simply won't put one up. That
outcome would be known by next Thursday. And then it would be back to
business as usual.
The idea that Mr Major would come back on Friday as an invigorated
font of authority, fortified by a new mandate from his party, is not
really credible. It would be the same Major with the same divisions and
the same problems.
His hope is that a stalking-horse will be less likely to emerge, and
if there is one, will get fewer votes under the dramatic circumstances
which have now been contrived than would be probable in November. It is
on the basis of that fine calculation that Mr Major has taken this step.
That is very much a strategy to secure Mr Major's own position within
the Tory Party. The reckoning is that he would then be safe until a
General Election. That's fine by me, yes indeed, but there are many
Conservatives who will be in black despair if the prospect of a
leadership change prior to facing the electorate is effectively taken
away from them by this device.
The intention is to bounce Tory MPs into retaining Mr Major as leader
right up to the General Election. The immediate question which will
determine whether or not there is to be a challenge is then less about
right or left, Europhobes or Europhiles.
It is about how many Tories with majorities under 10,000 are prepared
to put their heads above the parapet, rather than sit out what is now
the one chance to get shot of him.
Over the past few weeks, the Tory Party has been close to meltdown. I
don't know when Mr Major took his decision but yesterday's events alone
should have been enough to persuade him that things could not go on as
they have been.
First there was a letter to the Times -- whose editor presumably
couldn't believe his luck -- from Sir Patrick Mayhew in which he
''begged'' his colleagues ''to reflect on what they are doing'' with
particular regard for the Northern Ireland peace process.
You can't have Cabinet Ministers publicly ''begging'' Tory MPs to lay
off their Prime Minister. Then, to make matters worse, it emerged that
the 1922 Committee chairman had virtually called for Douglas Hurd to get
his jotters. It was just another day in the life of the Tory Party --
deeply reminiscent of the horrors which Labour endured in the early
1980s.
The major ideological fault line is over Europe. However, the
Euro-sceptics' aim is not necessarily to get rid of Major, but to move
him further and further towards their own position. Indeed, Teddy Taylor
said last night that he hoped there wouldn't be a contest and that he
would support John Major.
But in the very next breath, he declared that supposing there were a
hundred contests which Mr Major won, it still wouldn't solve his
problems on Europe. That is code for saying that once the leadership
election is over, exactly the same divisions will go on as before.
The most insidious problem which the Tory Party faces in the 1990s is
that it contains a significant party-within-a-party which owes a higher
loyalty to its own agenda -- anti-Europeanism -- than to such transient
matters as winning elections. Again, the parallel with Labour in the
early 80s is strong.
This is what makes a crucial minority of MPs impervious to the normal
threats and cajoling which brings politicians into line. They believe
they are fighting a higher cause, therefore they invoke a moral right to
act against the discipline of the party. That will certainly not be
changed by a leadership contest.
Wherever I go, there is now an extraordinary feeling of contempt for
Mr Major's shambolic Government.
The real bravery would, of course, be to admit that Government has
broken down and confront the country in a General Election. Mr Major
says that he is ''not prepared to tolerate the present situation.'' The
rest of us, unfortunately, do not yet have that choice.

A TORY VIEW
JOHN MAJOR has left most of the pundits in the media looking like
chumps, yet again. We read about ''top sources'' pontificating about his
future, ''friends'' confiding about his innermost thoughts and, best of
all, ''senior party figures,'' the weathervanes of Westminster giving
out predictions of the way the political wind is blowing.
Each is revelatory for they are most a nonsense. They are about as
reliable and ''in the know'' as racehorse telephone tipsters. They know
nothing about John Major.
Those who genuinely do, like Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, will
privately confess that Major has two discernable qualities -- he is a
gambler and he is unpredictable.
His unpredictability has been proven time and again. At the last
election while Neil Kinnock was having his bald patches powdered for the
TV cameras and attempting to anglicise his Welsh vowels, Major was
standing in the rain with his soapbox addressing crowds in the street.
Didn't everyone laugh? Didn't the cameras have a field day panning in
on the battered box? And didn't the chattering classes smile benignly at
the ''poor man'' who had no chance?
One of his final speeches in that campaign centred on the Union -- and
delivered in London -- on the need for the Scots to eschew silly ideas
like the Assembly or even separatism.
Didn't everyone laugh? Didn't all those ''in the know'' chuckle
gleefully at the prospect of a Scottish Tory wipe out?
And who had an inkling that here was a man capable of delivering the
greatest prize of all -- peace in Northern Ireland.
So yesterday's decision, while unpredictable, will come as no surprise
to those closest to him. He has called the bluff of his critics. He has
lit the match which has smoked them out.
This is not the action of a weak, vacillating man. Nor, incidentally
is it one of great courage as some have claimed as if he was Clark Kent
stripping down to his Superman suit.
What it represents is the cool calculation of a crafty politician. He
knows full well that the only survival most of the Tory back benchers
are interested in is their own. They hear the clock ticking towards a
General Election and suspect it contains a timebomb with all their names
on it.
As a result they would vote for Bill Walker as Conservative Party
leader and wear Greenpeace badges if they thought it would save their
skins. The Prime Minister has given them the chance to do so.
For it is not image that is the issue. Maybe the Prime Minister would
look better with Michael Heseltine's bouffant and Tony Blair's tooth
enamel but it's too late for that now.
To survive the next election it has to be about policies.
Would you buy a second hand policy form Theresa Gorman -- who
incidentally, yesterday pronounced the name of Italy's most famous
leaning tower as ''Pizza'' as in anchovies and a lot of cheese, please.
Or the ''walking dead'' like Sir Richard Body.
John Major is shrewd enough to play to his strengths. He represents
core values in which many Scots and the rest of Britain believe. He is a
man of integrity, honest and hard working. He is also concerned about
community.
These are old fashioned Tory beliefs. He also represents many of the
doubts, and certainties, which we, as Scots are particularly aware.
The issue which has torn the Tory Party apart is an aspect of this
uncertainty. Who can confidently say they want a single currency or to
move closer to a federal Europe?
These are huge and complex questions which John Major has urged that
we wait and see. It is the gambler in him. There may come a time when it
will be right to have a common currency and sometime in the third
millennium, federalism. These options must be kept open. Most people
would agree with him. How many would back someone such as Norman Lamont,
who effectively wants to close that door?
It would be a no contest. The British want to be in Europe but not
lackeys to it (with the exception of the Scottish Nationalists of
course).
John Major has invited the snipers within the party to come out into
the open. He has invited the Cassius's and Brutus's in his Cabinet to
emerge from the shadows. He has wrong-footed them and has done so
decisively. Of course it represents a risk. On a personal scale it rates
with Admiral Isoroku Yama Moto who ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor.
His comment at the time was: ''I like games of chance.''
So does Major although he will be hoping for a different result.
He senses that the only way he can unite the party is to clear the
air. It is what the party faithful have long been telling him. In
Scotland, in particular, the message for John Major from the grassroots
is to ''be himself.''
He is. And it will set him up nicely to take on the only man in
Westminster worthy to be his opponent -- Tony Blair. But watch your bets
on that one.

Moscow, Thursday
THE Russian Government, stung by a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence, sought to turn the tables on the State Duma today by
asking it for support or face dissolution.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, seeking a quick end to a growing
crisis, told the Duma he wanted MPs to make up their minds ''in the
shortest possible time''.
''The uncertainty about the government will lead to sharp
deterioration of the economic situation, will leave the country without
the 1996 budget . . . prompting political destabilisation,'' he said in
a letter to Duma.
Chernomyrdin was backed by President Boris Yeltsin, who earlier
publicly pledged support for the government and made it clear he would
exercise his constitutional right to dissolve Parliament if it did not
change its mind.
The Kremlin leader told reporters that Parliament would ''sign its own
death warrant'' if it did not back the government --- a clear threat to
call early elections.
Yesterday's vote by the Duma, furious after Chechen gunmen stormed the
town of Budennovsk, was non-binding but it pushed Russia towards a
constitutional quagmire.
Chernomyrdin argued today that he could not allow his government to
hang in the balance for three months -- the period that the constitution
allows the legislature to make a final decision on following up its
no-confidence vote.
According to the constitution, the Duma -- a fractious assembly
dominated by communist, ultra-nationalist, and agrarian opponents of
Yeltsin -- now has 10 days to make up its mind over the request for a
show of confidence.
Its decision is in fact expected tomorrow.
Tass quoted Yeltsin as warning the Duma not to try to topple the
Cabinet ''if it did not want to be dissolved''.
Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai said the Duma might try to drag
out proceedings. ''Duma deputies, preoccupied with preserving their
seats, will try to find ways of avoiding the potentially dangerous
vote,'' he told a news conference. ''This would be legally wrong and
politically dangerous.''
It was not clear, however, what Yeltsin would have to gain by forcing
early elections when a parliamentary poll is scheduled for December.
Political rival Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who heads the ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democratic Party, suggested Yeltsin's action was empty bluff.
Early elections in October or November would be an occasion for people
to ''unleash all the hatred over what is going on in the country'', he
said.
Today Yeltsin outlined a possible compromise suggesting he was ready
to axe top officials over the Budennovsk episode, in which 121 people
died.
A decision could be made when the policy-making Security Council meets
on June 29.
The anger of the Duma has been angled more at Yeltsin and the heads of
the ''power'' Ministries -- defence, interior, and the Federal Security
Service -- than at Chernomyrdin, who has emerged with enhanced stature
for dealing directly with the Buddenovsk crisis while Yeltsin was at the
G7 meeting in Canada.
Tass quoted Yeltsin saying there would be top personnel changes. ''I
am not saying many, but there will be some.''
Some leading MPs appeared keen to find a face-saving way out from the
situation as well. ''If the government acts reasonably and learns
something in the coming three months, the second vote of no-confidence
may never come,'' said Ivan Lapshin, head of the Agrarian Party.
* Chechens made big concessions today in talks with Russia on bringing
peace to the breakaway region, prompting both sides to issue a
triumphant statement that the conflict could be peacefully
resolved.--Reuter.

THE end of August appears to be the deadline for a solution to the
Bosnian crisis, otherwise the process to start withdrawing UN troops
will begin.
The Government considers the next two months crucial and that
everything depends on the response to the increased muscle given to the
UN Protection Force by the new rapid reaction force.
No-one dares signal in advance that withdrawal is on the cards,
because it would instantly destroy the effectiveness of Unprofor, and
the Prime Minister can be expected to oppose any such course.
The reality is that the discussions on Bosnia at the G7 Halifax summit
proved shambolic, according to highly placed sources, and the Clinton
administration was generally considered to be in an equally shambolic
state on the issue. The United States is determined on only one thing --
that America will not become involved on the ground in Bosnia, although
it may take part in air strikes.
There is no way Unprofor itself can become involved in a peace
enforcement role such as policing the borders between the warring
regions. That would immediately destroy its claim to be impartial.
As for the rapid reaction force, to which Britain and France have
contributed the largest share, it is there to ensure that the UN to
possesses the strength needed to ensure that relief convoys reach cities
like Sarajevo. The hope is that its existence, which provides the
capability to back up words with action, will give the Bosnian Serbs
pause for thought.
In Sarajevo itself, a two-year-old girl and a man were killed
yesterday when a shell exploded outside a building where people were
drawing water from a communal tap.
Shelling in the city on Wednesday left 12 people dead, including seven
at another water queue.

Washington, Thursday
THE score is Bob Dole 1, Phil Gramm 0, with President Bill Clinton and
Dr Henry Foster off on the sidelines complaining that they have not been
allowed to play.
The Senate polished off the nomination of Dr Foster to be Surgeon
General today. He can now go back to practise medicine in Tennessee and
Mr Clinton must look for a new candidate.
Democrats assert, quite rightly, that the vote was the first in next
year's presidential election.
Senator Gramm hoped to win it, by personally defeating Dr Foster.
Senator Dole beat him to it, and is still far ahead.
He outsmarted Senator Gramm, his chief rival for the Republican
nomination, and escaped from a trap specially designed for him with the
greatest of ease.
Dr Foster is a highly qualified practitioner who might be an excellent
Surgeon General, but as an obstetrician-gynaecologist he has performed a
number of abortions.
The anti-abortion forces in the Republican Party rallied against his
nomination. President Clinton and his staff should, of course, have
anticipated the event, and despairing Democrats can only assume that
no-one in the White House knew what obstetricians did for a living.
Senator Gramm, whose campaign has not been going well and who needs to
reassure the Christian right that he is one of them, despite all the
evidence, took the lead in opposing Dr Foster. He promised that he would
lead a filibuster against it, if it took all summer.
On the other flank, Senator Arlen Specter, the only moderate running
for the Republican nomination, said that he supported Dr Foster, and he
clearly expected to win the votes of all pro-choice Republicans.
Senator Dole fell between the two stools. He is leader of the Senate,
and his two rivals were winning all the publicity. He solved the problem
by making sure that at least 41 Republicans would stand firm against the
nomination, and then staging a quick, three-hour debate and a snap vote
when no-one expected it.
The crucial vote was yesterday. Today's vote confirmed it.
Mr Clinton was left fuming that it was all unfair, which it was.
Senator Gramm lost a splendid opportunity to grandstand, and Senator
Dole defeated Dr Foster without committing himself irrevocably to the
pro-life side. The war is not over, by any means, but Senator Dole is
winning, so far.

MR MAJOR yesterday deplored those who gave in to ''misguided
pressures.'' He was talking about foreign governments, Brent Spar, and
Greenpeace.
Ninety minutes later, in the Downing Street rose garden, he confronted
''misguided pressures'' nearer home and declared he was not giving in to
them.
The Euro-terrorists of the Fresh Start group were in his sights,
alongside the environmental terrorists of Greenpeace. The wimps in Shell
UK might yield but if anyone was going to be dumped in deep water it was
not going to be him.
Unhappily, party rules do not provide for the Special Boat Service to
raid the 1922 Committee and carry away those whose names are marked on a
card provided by the Chief Whip. Like it or not, and for many moons the
Conservative Party did not like it, differences of opinion have to be
settled by the ballot not the bullet.
Still, there were echoes of the long walk down main street in the old
Westerns where the bully suddenly realises that the mild-mannered man in
the grey stetson may be quick on the draw. Now he has to decide whether
to go for his gun or back down.
Tormented beyond bearing, the man who hates killing buckles on his
gun-belt. Mr Major strode to the rose garden and said this could not go
on.
Mr Tony Blair had said in the Commons earlier that this could not go
on. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary had written to
the Times to say it could not go on. Clearly, when a situation gets so
grave as to require a letter to the times, even Mr Rupert Murdoch's
Times, something has got to be done.
Once you've made up your mind you are going to fight the relief can be
enormous. Stopping off at the Commons on the way to the rose garden, Mr
Major cracked a joke. A large number of councillors' relations have
found their way into the employment of Monklands Council, he mused.
''The personnel department was more like the family planning
department.'' It was not quite ''it is a far, far better thing, I do . .
. '' but at least he was going to meet destiny with a quip on his lips.
Even as he prepared to come to grips with his own party, he could see
grounds for hope in the future. They might only be tiny green shoots but
still. Labour had produced another policy -- on English education. So he
inflicted a bit of damage on that before leaving to announce the title
fight.
As the minutes ticked by in the rose garden, speculation mounted that
some Cabinet Ministers were frantically phoning begging him not to take
the risk. ''Wait till November'' one could almost hear Mr Hesletine
plead.
The party was on the rack said Mr Major. The country was on the rack,
said Mr Blair. ''Brave, courageous, bold'' chanted a line of loyalists
to camera. The others were in conclave deciding on who was to lead the
kamikaze first ballot mission.
This person does not get to be leader. He or she is doomed to be
gunned down. The question is can they wound the man seriously enough for
him to leave town.
Mr Blair, who would alwasy be cast as the man in the white hat, who
rides in to clean up the mess said on television that things were in
such a mess that someone needed to ride in and clean it up.
Mr Major made clear to the roses that life as Tory leader is so
uncomfortable under the current terms and conditions of employment that
he plans to rewrite them.
For him the leadership contest will be a sort of party leader's Social
Chapter. He will just have to hope that his criticisms of the EU version
do not apply and that no job loss will result from its introduction.

New York, Thursday
ISRAEL and world Jewry have decided to take on the super-secret world
of Swiss banking in a bid to retrieve tens of millions of pounds
deposited by Jews seeking to safeguard their funds from Nazi
persecutors.
The Israeli Government and representatives of leading Jewish groups
last week named billionaire businessman Edgar Bronfman to negotiate with
the Swiss Government and banks for the funds that went unclaimed after
the Second World War, largely because the depositors died in the
Holocaust.
''Nobody really knows the exact amount that is being held in the Swiss
banks or what has happened to the money. I have figures that range from
the tens of millions to billions if you take into account currency
fluctuations and accrued interest,'' said Israel Singer, secretary
general of the World Jewish Congress.
Israeli Prime Yitzhak Rabin, Finance Minister Avraham Shochat, and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres gave Bronfman his mandate last week.
Holocaust survivors have complained for years that they cannot break
through the wall of secrecy protecting Swiss banks to find out what they
did with tens of thousands of unclaimed accounts started by Jews as the
Nazis clamped down during the 1930s.
With six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, at the war's end there
were few people to come forward and fewer with the sort of iron-clad
documentation the Swiss required for payment.
Relatives of depositors have found themselves regularly turned away
from Swiss banks on the grounds that they need not keep records for more
than 10 years.
Singer said some of the deposits may have wound up in the coffers of
the Swiss Red Cross, which apologised three years ago for its wartime
failure to speak out against the Holocaust.--Reuter.

Stuart Trotter describes the two kinds of leadership challengers who
could emerge.
THE first ballot challenger to John Major is not the man or woman who
will be king. His or her job is to get a result which damages the Prime
Minister so badly that he has to resign as leader.
The first ballot challenger is the kamikaze pilot who, if successful,
opens the election up to the Cabinet Ministers who are bound by their
professions of loyalty to hold back until Mr Major, hit by a large
combined total of votes against him and abstentions, goes out of the
fight.
Favourite stalking horse is Norman Lamont, MP for Kingston-on-Thames,
who has never forgiven Mr Major for sacking him as Chancellor of the
Exchequer, making him the scapegoat for an economic policy for which, he
believes, the man in No 10 was just as responsible.
His Commons seat disappears at the next election, thanks to
redistribution, and he is having trouble finding another. He may feel
that a Cabinet place and another seat could be the reward for downing Mr
Major, but he might be wrong about that.
He has been an outspoken and often effective critic of federalist
tendencies in the European Union and the move towards a single European
currency, but is not taken seriously by many of the Euro-sceptics,
although they have welcomed his recent speeches.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the feisty MP for Billericay, is an undoubted
volunteer kamikaze. She will probably stand if no-one else will.
However, though far from being just the lightweight self-publicist her
ill-wishers in the party describe, she would not be a strong candidate.
If Major critics decide a challenge must be made, they could probably
scrape together 33 nominations for her, but that would be about the
level of her vote. Abstentions would have to be heavy to unseat Mr
Major.
Much the same goes for Mr John Carlisle (MP for Luton North) who last
year announced his willingness to be a stalking horse. A self-proclaimed
''hanger and flogger,'' his far-right stance would probably deter even
dissatisfied MPs from the centre of the party from casting, even secret,
ballots for him.
Mr Christopher Gill, MP for Ludlow, who comes from a sausage-making
family in Shropshire is a relentless and able critic of the European
Union. However, the rebels will be searching for someone with a broader
appeal.
A real prize would be former party chairman and Home Secretary Kenneth
Baker, who showed signs just a week ago of leaning towards a Portillo
leadership, but hastily denied this when an interview was so
interpreted.
He would be in a better position to argue that as Mr Major has
arranged an election he must want a contest and that, as a senior figure
without personal ambition, he was giving the parliamentary party the
opportunity to express a view on the Prime Minster's leadership.
He or someone like him, senior and not too conspicuously anti-EU
obsessed, would have the best chance of roping in some hesitant
backbench votes.
If Mr Major goes, the big beasts and perhaps one medium-sized one
enter the lists.
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, is the only
genuinely charismatic leader the Tories have left and, whatever his
professions of loyalty, no-one doubts that he has always wanted to be
Prime Minister.
Against him is the inability of some Thatcherites to forgive him for
having been the stalking horse who destroyed Mrs Thatcher. Also he is a
known supporter of pan-European co-operation and is suspected of perhaps
even approving the ultimate goal of federation.
However, there has been talk of a deal with the Euro-sceptics if Mr
Major was to go. For him is the fact that most Tories in marginal seats
think they would have a better chance of holding them at the next
election with him as leader rather than Mr Major.
Though scoffed at publicly by Labour, he is secretly feared as a
consummate political operator. Some Tories think Mr Blair's charisma can
only be trumped by Mr Heseltine's charisma and experience.
Mr Michale Portillo, the Employment Secretary, is now seen as the real
Thatcher heir who was too young to immediately succeed her. Backers say
his youth, 42, would enable him to match Mr Blair.
However, he is suspected by Tories who are not members of his fan club
of being overrated. Almost certainly, he could not win against Mr
Heseltine, but could do well enough to force his appointment as Foreign
Secretary or Chancellor and give him standing as the likely next leader
from the right.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, Education Secretary, surprised many by becoming
the only Minister to indicate that if the job of leader became vacant
she might well stand for it. Going for her is her more moderate
right-wingery and at Education she has been an active conciliator.
Her campaign pitch would be based on her ability to reunite the party
and conciliate the factions as she is currently trying to conciliate the
teachers. Definitely not another Thatcher. Against her, though, is her
lack of charisma. She is small and lacks power in speech-making.
Unlikely to poll well if she stood.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer, is currently only
popular with the small band of left-wing radicals who are far from
having the votes to enable him to make a good show. However, he is a
pugnacious and effective Commons performer and is adroit on television.
Apart from being loathed by the right, his problem is that, although
much cleverer than Neil Kinnock, he is considered to have the same
ability to lose an election with a single phrase during a campaign.
He knows he cannot win at the moment and might move aside to give Mr
Heseltine a clear run, but could stand to preserve his status in the
party. Even those who will not back him this time reckon he would be a
splendid Leader of the Opposition.

Rouen, Thursday
NINE people died during a teenagers' outing in a cave in northern
France used by German troops in the Second World War to conceal V1
''doodlebug'' rockets.
The dead included three teenagers, one of their fathers, and five
members of the team that went to look for them.
The nine were apparently killed by a high concentration of carbon
monoxide gas in the tunnels, outside the village of Buchy near the
northern river port of Rouen. The lethal gas may have been created by a
fire lit by the teenagers.
The cave was used during the war to hide some of the feared V1 rockets
fired at Britain by German forces across the Channel.
One rescue worker described the cave as being holed like Swiss cheese
by 10ft tunnels.
Relatives said Pierre Lamperrier, 14, and brothers Nicolas, 14, and
Thomas Have, 13, had visited the cave many times before their fatal
trip.
The alarm was raised last night when the father of the brothers went
looking for them and failed to return.
A search turned into another tragedy when a fire brigade medical
captain and a villager were overcome by fumes and died. Three other fire
brigade members were brought out ill before the search was suspended to
blow the lethal gas out of the galleries overnight.
Another rescue squad, equipped with breathing apparatus and helped by
expert cave explorers, went in this morning.
They brought out a seriously ill fire brigade member and found the
bodies of the youths, the father, and three more rescuers.
Prefect Jean-Paul Proust told reporters that the bodies of the
teenagers were found far from the entrance to the cave. The body of the
father was far away from them.
Local officials have banned access to the cave. A judicial inquiry
will be held.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
Paris, Thursday
IRAN today refused to budge on its ''death sentence'' on British
writer Salman Rushdie, despite recent signs that it would exploit
loopholes to appease the EU.
Today's hard-line response was apparently a reaction to the tough
words used at the recent G7 summit in Canada, where heads of the world's
richest nations linked Iran to terrorism.
Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said his government's
position on the fatwa, imposed on Rushdie in 1989 by the late Ayatollah
Khomeini for alleged blasphemy in The Satanic Verses, was unalterable.
In April the EU formally asked Iran to pledge that it would take no
action against Rushdie on European soil. Iranian officials as senior as
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had indicated the demand would
receive a positive response.
Today however Vaezi met French, German, and Spanish officials in Paris
and, according to an Iranian news agency, said that far from bowing to
the EU ''we offered no response''.
He added: ''However, in the course of negotiations, we explicitly
reiterated the validity and unalterability of the late imam's 'fatwa'.''
Velayati recently said that Iran could not abrogate Khomeini's edict
but would commit itself to not carrying it out.
''The Iranians want to come along to a settlement along the lines set
out (by the G7), but they can't lift the fatwa,'' said an EU source.
Talks are continuing.--AP/Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Plutonium goes 'missing' from Dounreay plant</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977748255</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HIGHLY-radioactive plutonium has apparently gone missing from
Dounreay.
Eleven pounds has been officially posted ''lost'' during operations
from the plant, which re-processes plutonium-based fuel pins from the
prototype fast reactor.
A further one-and-a-half pounds of highly-enriched uranium is missing
from another Dounreay re-processing plant, which handles fuel pins from
research reactors in Europe.
Both plutonium and enriched uranium can be used in the making of
atomic weapons. Plutonium's radioactive rays can be absorbed by bone
marrow, making it potentially one of the most dangerous cancer-causing
radioactive substance.
The amounts are listed under ''material unaccounted for'' at Britain's
main nuclear sites.
A spokesman for the Caithness plant, Mr Ian Shepherd, said he was
''absolutely certain'' the material had not been stolen. He said he was
equally sure this amount of highly-radioactive substances had not been
flushed down drains into the Pentland Firth.
The Atomic Energy Authority, which operates Dounreay, said the
discrepancy is due to a new analysis technique for measuring the weight
of plutonium.
Mr Shepherd admitted this new system had been quickly found to be
flawed, and Dounreay plant operators had reverted to using the previous
type of auditing procedure.
However, anti-nuclear activist Lorraine Mann, of Easter Ross, said:
''This excuse sounds like nonsense to me.''
Mrs Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, went on: ''It seems
that deadly radioactive materials are genuinely going missing from these
Dounreay re-processing plants, which is extremely worrying.
''There is the suspicion that the materials are escaping either
through discharges to the sea or by some other route. This concern will
remain until the matter is cleared up.''
She said that if it were a genuine accounting error, then one would
expect there would be a surplus some years and a deficit in others.
In the previous year, Dounreay reported a ''loss'' of almost five
pounds of plutonium and three pounds of enriched uranium.
Dounreay's reprocessing activities are scrutinised by Euroatom, the EU
organisation designed to stop bomb-grade materials getting into the
hands of terrorists or ''rogue'' regimes.

A TEENAGE girl is seriously ill in Ruchill hospital, Glasgow,
suffering from the potentially fatal condition, toxic shock syndrome.
The 15-year-old, from Dunbartonshire, was admitted earlier this week.
A form of blood poisoning, TSS affects only about 40 people each year
in the UK, of which up to three may die. It is so unusual that most GPs
will never see a case throughout their career.
Hospital officials at Ruchill yesterday refused to discuss the case.
The girl's father has confirmed the nature of her illness but asked The
Herald not to identify his daughter. She is thought to be out of
immediate danger but is still seriously ill.
The cause of her condition has not been determined but TSS in young
women is frequently linked to the use of tampons.
A spokeswoman for the TSS Information Service, which is funded by
tampon manufacturers, conceded yesterday that around half of all cases
were associated with women using tampons, and two-thirds of cases
involve people aged under 25.
The industry publicly denies a direct connection between their
products and TSS but, in recent years, has published warning notices on
packets and urged users to follow strict guidelines.
A specialist yesterday stressed that the syndrome could affect almost
anyone, including men and children, who can develop it through burns,
boils or insect bites.
Dr David Abramovich, a consultant gynaecologist at Aberdeen Maternity
Hospital, said TSS was caused by a common bacteria, staphylococcus
aureus, which is carried quite harmlessly by up to one third of people.
Fewer than 5% carry the dangerous strains of the bacteria, and most of
them never develop TSS, whose symptoms are similar to an extreme case of
influenza.
* Earlier this month, the family of student Gillian Wilson, 21, from
Lochwinnoch, claimed she had died from TSS after using tampons.

AN announcement that two directors and a senior manager at Kvaerner
Govan have left the shipyard is expected to be made by the company.
The Norwegian firm, the last large yard on the Upper Clyde, is
expected to tell union officials and senior staff of the developments
today.
Kvaerner's managing director, Mr Kjell Mikalsen, and other company
representatives failed to answer calls from The Herald yesterday to
confirm the departures and the circumstances but it is understood the
men involved have been on an ''extended holiday'' for the past two weeks
after a boardroom disagreement.
The three are industrial relations director Robert Gordon, technical
director Dirk Djikster, and senior production manager Jim Thompson.
Mr Thompson was production director until about a year ago and,
although he still had executive responsibilities, he had not been
attending board meetings.
Kvaerner Govan, which employs 1400 workers, said last month that its
productivity had to be improved if was to land a large new contract this
summer.
The parent company, which is the biggest shipbuilding group in Europe,
singled out Govan for criticism in its quarterly statement and said
earnings there remained unsatisfactory.
An internal drive to remedy the situation and to produce three vessels
a year was continuing but the yard was not yet performing as well as
divisions in Germany.

THE MP for Monklands West, Mr Tom Clarke, under heavy fire from the
Labour leadership to make his views known on the corruption scandal in
the constituency he has represented for more than two decades, finally
broke cover yesterday.
However, he declined to answer reporters' questions directly.
The former Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, who until the Black
report was published had claimed allegations against Monklands district
councillors were pure myth and smears, said in a statement he fully
backed their suspension from the Labour Party.
Most of those now facing expulsion and possible criminal prosecution
are close friends of the MP.
Mr Clarke, who had been a Monklands councillor for 18 years and had
served some time as provost before being elected to the House of
Commons, also made it known yesterday he was on the side of law and
order.
He declared he would support any action taken by the procurator-fiscal
following the damning Black inquiry into the council's affairs.
All this was made public through an intermediary.
Mr Clarke insisted last night he was far too busy dealing with the
problems of the disabled to meet reporters and answer questions directly
over the Monklands affair.
In the three days since the Black report was published, Mr Clarke has
tried to keep his head down and to dodge reporters' questions.
It was only after The Herald yesterday highlighted the MP's reluctance
to face the press that a statement on his behalf was released.
There can be little doubt that Mr Clarke was hoping that if he kept
out of the limelight long enough then the whole affair might disappear.
That was not to be.
Under heavy pressure, Mr Clarke was eventually persuaded to produce
yesterday's statement.
It read: ''I fully support the firm and decisive action taken by Tony
Blair and Tom Sawyer (Labour Party secretary) in the light of the
publication of the Black report into Monklands District Council. The
report makes very disturbing reading and the issues it raises must be
resolved rapidly.
''It is well known that in the past I have consistently called on Ian
Lang (Secretary of State for Scotland) to hold an inquiry and it is also
well known that I advised Monklands District Council to investigate the
inquiry conducted by Professor Black.
''I will, of course, support any action the procurator-fiscal decides
to take as a result of any references from Professor Black and any
further action resulting from the Labour Party inquiry announced by Tom
Sawyer.
''The decent people of Monklands deserve a good Labour council, run to
the highest possible standards. That is what they want. It is now up to
all of us to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that is what
they get.''
Mr Clarke's London office made it clear that the MP could not be
contacted because he had a full diary dealing with his role as a
spokesman on disabled people's rights.
However, his office said it was feasible the MP might respond to
written questions.
Taking that on face value, The Herald attempted to ask the MP if he
still stood by his original assertions that the inquiries into the
council were McCarthyite-type smears and based on mythology.
Also, during his 18 years as a councillor, had he been aware of any
bias in recruitment of staff or on spending policies.
The Herald wondered if Mr Clarke was currently considering his own
position.
An aide, having studied the questions, said last night: ''I am sorry,
we can't get those questions to Tom tonight.''

CABINET Ministers lined up to back Mr Major after his announcement.
They were headed by Trade President Michael Heseltine, who pledged to
support Mr Major in the leadership contest, saying: ''The Prime Minister
has been subjected to relentless speculation. He is determined to put an
end to this in the interests of the Conservative Party and of the
country.''
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard said: ''I totally support the
Prime Minister and will be working with him and on his behalf during
this campaign.''
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called Mr Major's resignation ''a brave
step by a brave man and a needed step too''.
He said as he arrived for an EU meeting in Luxembourg: ''He's the best
Prime Minister for my country, I wish him all success.''
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said he believed no members of the
Cabinet would stand against Mr Major.
''I believe if anybody stands against him, he will win big,'' he
added.
''I think what he has done will be seen as bold and courageous. It's
characteristic of the leadership he has given over the last few years.''
Former Tory Minister Lord Tebbit said he believed Mr Major would
probably have a ''resounding victory''.
''I think John Major has learned from Margaret Thatcher's
experience,'' he said.
''He has probably taken the best tactical opportunity that he can to
force the issue, get it over, and I think with a clear wind behind him
nobody's going to challenge him in November.''
Senior Tory back bencher Sir Andrew Bowden (Brighton Kemptown) said Mr
Major's decision showed ''enormous courage and determination.
''Now his critics must either put up or shut up.''
Tory MP Bill Walker (Tayside North) said he had ''grave doubts'' that
anybody would stand against Mr Major.
Lord St John of Fawsley, a Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher,
said Mr Major had acted ''courageously, unselfishly and indeed nobly.
''The important thing now is to get the leadership election over as
soon as possible to end uncertainty.''
He added: ''He will win the leadership election and will deserve to do
so and will remain Prime Minister until the next General Election.''
Euro-sceptic Sir Teddy Taylor said: ''I am sorry there is going to be
a contest at all.
''I regard John Major as a straight, honorable and decent person and
if anyone can solve the Euro problem he's most likely to do it.
''I support him. I have supported him and will support him. But even
if you hold a hundred constests the problem of the EU has still got to
be solved.''
Sir Teddy added: ''I hope there won't be a contest and we won't waste
our time with a nasty, horrible, filthy political battle.''
Mr Major's constituency agent at Huntingdown, Mr Peter Brown said:
''We are 100% behind him and always have been. I am absolutely sure if
you go around the country you will find vast support for John Major.''
''If people want a change, let them try to bring one about now. What
this means is that at last we can clear the air.
''What is interesting is that the vast majority of MPs appear to be
behind Mr Major. I feel sure that he's going to win this leadership
election and it will be a resounding victory, and I think that is the
view throughout the party.''
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the trade union Unison, said:
''John Major's resignation is not enough.
''The whole Government should go now and allow the people to elect a
new Government which will change the disastrous economic policies
pursued by the Tories.''

TORY MP Teresa Gorman, a former whipless Euro-rebel, said yesterday
she did not rule out the possibility that she would challenge Mr Major.
''I hope a candidate will come forward to challenge. I believe the
whips' calculation is that nobody will call their bluff,'' she said.
''This opportunity (for a challenge) may not occur again.''
She suggested one reason Mr Major acted yesterday was because many of
his bitterest critics on Europe were travelling to a public meeting.
''There are a number of my colleagues who happen this afternoon to be
on their way to a very large public meeting in Malvern, and who will not
yet be aware perhaps of what has happened here this afternoon.
''Perhaps that was part of the calculation.''
She told ITN: ''There are a large number of people in Parliament who
share the concern of the great majority of the British people that the
power of our country is slipping away to Brussels, and this may be the
only opportunity we will have to go forward with a policy which will put
British interests and the British nation above any interests in
Brussels.''

TENNIS stars past and present paid tribute yesterday to a champion of
champions, Fred Perry. They gathered to honour the massive contribution
of the man, known as ''Mr Tennis'', who had given his life to the sport.
Not only did he change the face of the game as a player with a
hat-trick of Wimbledon wins, the first all four grand slam titles, and
Davis cup victories for England, he went on to give vital encouragement
to top competitors over generations.
Yesterday, at a memorial service in St Paul's Cathedral -- its steps
lined with ball boys and girls in the Wimbledon club's famous green and
purple colours -- the players all agreed the sportsman who died four
months ago, aged 85, was unique.
''He was Mr Tennis for me. He was Mr Tennis for everybody. He was the
best,'' said Ilie Nastase.
Virginia Wade, who in 1977 was the last English winner of the women's
title, said: ''He was larger than life. He had a tremendous character
and personality.''
Newly knighted pop singer Sir Cliff Richard, a keen player, added:
''It's good to be able to celebrate somebody who did so much for so many
people.''
Miss Wade, Martina Navratilova, John Newcombe, and defending Wimbledon
champion Pete Sampras read Rudyard Kipling's If.
Steffi Graf was to have read one verse but is thought to have returned
to Germany for treatment on a sprained right wrist just four days before
the All England tournament.
Other famous players, who joined Perry's widow, Bobby, and children at
the tribute to the last Englishman to win Wimbledon 59 years ago,
included Ken Rosewall, Pam Shriver, and Stan Smith.

Rising to the top in the political arena does not happen by accident,
writes William Russell
JOHN Major's streak of ruthlessness may have come as a surprise, but
its existence should have never been in doubt. He apparently came from
nowhere to succeed Margaret Thatcher in November 1990, having barely
featured in the lists of the likely heirs apparent over the years she
was in charge.
He was a very late entry indeed. But in politics that sort of victory
does not happen by accident. People who get to the top have been
planning to get there throughout their political careers, otherwise
there is no point to their being in politics in the first place. Their
motiviation may be unselfish, patriotic and noble. They may genuinely
desire to do good to their fellow men. But the goal is getting office
because without office all the rest is so much hot air.
He had shown how ruthless he could be when he ditched the man who
masterminded his leadership election campaign, Norman Lamont, whose
reward had been to be appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was
sacked three years later in May 1993 for doing his master's bidding, and
has been a thorn in his former friend's flesh ever since.
Yesterday's calling of his party's bluff is further proof of John
Major's ruthlessness. The boldness of the challenge to put up or shut up
is breathtaking. It is either the action of someone who has calculated
the odds and decided the risk is worth it, or of someone whose vocation
is to be a Kamikaze pilot. Either way it is the act of a man of nerve.
The election result will show one way or the other.
Clearly waiting for someone to bell the cat in November, which was the
alternative, would have meant a long hot summer of plots and
counterplots, of speculation, well and ill founded. Better to pre-empt
that.
His origins are humble, but thanks to the efforts of his elder
brother, Terry, no longer obscure. His father, Thomas Major Ball, was a
sometime music hall entertainer who eventually became a manufacturer of
garden ornaments, mainly gomes, in Brixton, south London.
A child of his father's old age -- Thomas Major Ball was 66 when John
was born -- he went to Rutlish Grammar School, leaving with some
qualifications, although he has been extremely vague about just what
O-levels he possesses, at 16. He dropped the Ball surname somewhere
along the way to public life.
He joined the local Tory party at the age of 16, his interest in
politics having been whetted by the local Labour MP, Marcus Lipton, a
famous Lambeth character. He held various offices in the local party
before becoming chairman in 1970.
From 1969-71 he was a Lambeth councillor, becoming chairman of the
housing committee in 1970. As a teenager he famously applied for a job
as a bus conductor and failed the test, worked as a navvy for the next
two years -- the Major Balls having fallen on evil days. Aged 18 he
joined the then District Bank as a trainee. He had a taste for figures
and from 1965-81 rose steadily up the ranks of what became the Standard
Chartered Bank. While with the bank he was posted to Nigeria, where he
damaged his knee in a road accident which left him with a permanently
gammy leg.
He fought St Pancras North in both the 1974 General Elections, before
getting Huntingdonshire, a seat he represented from 1979-83, and in its
boundary changed manifestation as Huntingdon. He is probably the most
''ordinary bloke'' of all the post war British Prime Ministers, both in
his origins and general style.
Harold Wilson affected ordinariness, but it was deceptive. And while
the trappings of power do affect people eventually, he has been, until
recently, renmarkably approachable. On the lobby trips, Mrs Thatcher
would make a foray to meet the hacks from time to time. The trouble was
keeping John Major up front where he belonged, although that no longer
happens.
His resistance to altering the way he speaks is proof of that stubborn
streak. A less stubborn man would have done something about that
irritating and easily imitated habit of pronouncing ''want'' as
''wunt''.
The suits have been improved, the haircut is better, the ties are
smarter, but there has been none of the remaking that Mrs Thatcher
underwent. He has now been Prime Minister for five years, having
inherited a party divided, whose divisions have not healed under his
leadership. They have, if anything, got worse.
Perhaps it is because, unlike Margaret Thatcher, he is not a man to
offer a vision. He cannot inspire. He is a man who strives after the big
idea, but somehow he never manages to come up with one. Proof of that
are those citizens' charters intended to help the man in the street, but
which nobody takes seriously. They have probably given more people a
better idea of their rights, while giving those providing services
standards to work to, but they have not inspired gratitude among the
beneficiaries.
Napoleon asked about a general he was being urged to make a Marshal of
France -- ''Is he lucky?'' John Major was lucky until the day he became
Prime Minister, after which it changed. His first job after entering the
Commons was in the whip's office, his natural home, where he stayed from
1983-85, gaining the patronage of the then powerful chief whip, John
Wakeham.
He moved to a junior job at Social Security. He was an Under Secretary
there from 1985-86 and then Minister of State with responsibility for
the disabled from 1986-87. That he had administrative ability was clear,
but he had little charisma and gave all the signs of being a workhorse
Minister who would rise so far, but no further.
Then, in 1987, Mrs Thatcher sent him to the Treasury as Chief
Secretary and he proved very successful indeed in coping with the annual
spending round -- the Chief Secretary's job is to make the spending
departments cut their budgets. He held the job for two years before she
made him Foreign Secretary after getting rid of Geoffrey Howe in July
1989.
It may not have been over promotion, but it was a transfer to an area
of policy in which he had shown little interest, of which he knew little
about. The four months he held the post, which included the Kuala Lumpur
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, where Mrs Thatcher interfered
and disowned the deal he had struck over sanctions against South Africa,
were not successful. But she liked him, and he was patently a friendly,
open man. The ordinary bloke reputation us not undeserved.
In October 1989 she made him Chancellor of the Exchequer and he was
back where he felt most comfortable. In 1990, when she was challenged
for the leadership, he emerged both as the man she favoured and the Stop
Heseltine Candidate, and won. He fitted the bill for a Party which
wanted someone less abrasive than she had been, a man who would ensure
it a quiet life. That quiet life, however, did not materialise as the
party proceeded to put itself on the rack over Europe, the exchange rate
mechanism, the single currency.
John Major, however, has had his successes. At the Maastricht European
summit he trimmed and tacked, emerging with a compromise on monetary
union, which ought to have done the trick. He has achieved a great
success in Northern Ireland where the prospects for peace have never
been better, and it could be his political legacy if the leadership
election does not wreck it.
In Scotland he has not rebuilt the party, which had disintegrated
under his predecessor. He is a southern Englishman who does not believe
in devolution, and stands firm behind the Union.
Whatever else he is, John Major, is not a toff, but a self-made man in
the Norman Tebbit mould, whose protege he for some time was, until they
fell out. He belongs to no magic circle. He has, as all Prime Ministers
do, mastered the necessary style at the dispatch box in the Commons and
can be extremely waspish on occasion.
Whatever else is said of him, nobody denies he is a fighter, even if
fighting the good fight involves giving ground to win the day, rather
than standing firm. When the party picked him in 1990 in preference to
Michael Heseltine it was trying to avoid having to fasten the seatbelts
and be prepared for a bumpy ride.
But that is what it got. The biggest bump lies ahead in two week's
time, and it is the appeaser, the quiet life leader, who has brought it
about.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang emerged last night as a key figure at the
heart of the campaign by Prime Minister John Major to see off his
critics and continue as leader of his party and the country.
The contest throws up an intriguing battle, pitching the urbane MP for
Galloway and Upper Nithsdale against a fellow Scot -- the embittered
former Chancellor Norman Lamont, who ran Mr Major's campaign when he
first became party leader but has since become one of his most bitter
critics.
The nominal head of the re-election campaign this time round is Lord
Cranborne but the real leaders are the two deputies, Mr Lang and
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney.
Mr Lang is known as a long-time close associate of Mr Major and their
brand of moderate Conservatism is seen as making them a key political
pairing, their future careers intertwined. They are seen as a
centre-party axis against the right-wing focus on Employment Secretary
Michael Portillo and his Scottish associate, Home Office Minister
Michael Forsyth.
Mr Lang was quickly in the media spotlight yesterday as the leadership
campaign took off, leaving party critics flat-footed. He revealed that
even to such a trusted lieutenant as himself, Mr Major had shown his
hand only within the previous 24 hours.
The Scottish Secretary also made clear that not all Cabinet members
had been consulted directly -- some had only been told ''through
intermediaries'' -- and that after this contest there could be no
further challenge until November, 1996.
''I would expect the Prime Minister to win and to win comfortably,''
he said. ''I would hope no-one would challenge him at all and therefore
the exercise would be complete, but it is right to give the party the
opportunity to clear the air so that he and the rest of the Government
can get on with the important decisions of government.
''The mathematics are that the Prime Minister needs a majority and he
needs to get 15% more than the parliamentary party numbers entitled to
vote but that is some way down the road yet. The nomination papers go in
next Thursday. He may not be challenged.
''I think it is important that we have this exercise so that it clears
the air, and then he can focus on the business of government. Victory is
what we are aiming for and victory is what I am confident we shall
achieve.
''It is very encouraging that the Prime Minister has the support of
the entire Cabinet. He will have the support of the entire Government,
and the 1922 Committee have made clear they will all sign his nomination
papers.''
He stressed: ''We won't really know whether there is a campaign as
such until next Thursday when the Prime Minister's nomination papers
will have been lodged and there is anybody else who challenges him.
''In the meantime it is business as usual, very much. The Prime
Minister will be continuing with his diary and so will other members of
the Government.''
Was there not a danger that a stalking-horse candidate would damage Mr
Major and force him from office? ''You can always speculate about things
like that and I have no doubt there will be an awful lot of speculation
over the next few days,'' said Mr Lang.
''The important thing is that the Prime Minister, having reflected on
this matter for some time, has decided that it is not just in the
Government's and the Conservative Party's interest but also in the
national interest to put an end to all this endless speculation, which
would have dragged on for the next few months.
''It is a courageous thing to do. It shows him leading from the front
and I think it is right so that we can get this out of the way, any
contestant can put up or shut up and then we will get on with the
business of government.''
Asked about discussion of the resignation in the Cabinet, he said:
''No, there wasn't. Cabinet was very much business as usual. This matter
was not discussed at Cabinet. This was a party matter.
''The Prime Minister has spoken to most members of the Cabinet
individually On any reshuffle that may follow if Mr Major wins or is
returned unopposed, Mr Lang said: ''I think the Prime Minister will
decide when to reconstruct his Government and will take account of the
fact that the leadership election is behind him and that he can now
contemplate the rest of the Parliament.
''He will focus on the delivery of our policies and the successful
completion of our programme and I have no doubt that, in the context of
that, he will give consideration to the total membership of the
Government.''
