THE first substantial contingent of American troops will arrive in Bosnia
tomorrow. President Clinton gave the order last night to activate the first
part of the peace plan, and some 700 American communications and logistics
specialists will be sent immediately to Tuzla.
A small number of specialists are already there. They have been examining the
airport to recommend what improvements it needs to cope with 20,000 soldiers.
The full deployment of American and allied troops will begin after the treaty
is finally signed in Paris on December 14, at a ceremony that President Clinton
hopes to attend.
In a press conference in Madrid today, the president said: ``I have authorised
the Secretary of Defence to order the deployment of the preliminary troops to
Bosnia, as I said I would as soon as I was convinced that the military plan was
appropriate.''
He also said that he was not deterred by the defiance of General Ratko Mladic,
who has rejected the peace deal signed in Ohio last month and said it would
have to be reworked.
``No, I don't think the treaty is in trouble and, no, I don't think it should
be renegotiated,'' said Mr Clinton, who is depending on President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to bring the Bosnian Serbs into line.
The arriving troops' first duty will be to prepare bases and depots for those
who will follow. There is no accommodation for 60,000 allied troops anywhere in
Bosnia, and winter is imminent. Engineers will need to build up the airports in
a hurry, construct barracks and warehouses, and bring in the huge mass of
equipment that a modern army requires.
They last did it in the Gulf in 1990-91. The differences are that the Gulf was
further from base and the operation on a far larger scale.
However, the weather was much better and the allies landing in Saudi Arabia
were sure of their welcome. They are not at all sure in Bosnia.
The allies all have the authority to defend themselves with whatever force is
appropriate. American television and newspapers are full of stories of Islamic
mujahideen fighters from Afghanistan, Iran, and Egypt who have gone to Bosnia
to fight for the faith and who distrust the allies as much as they do the Serbs
and Croats.
The British, too, have encountered mujahideen forces. One of the next tasks for
the diplomats will be to persuade the Bosnian Government to disarm them and
send them packing.
On the home front, Republican leaders have now fallen into line behind the
president. Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, after a period of
hesitation has come out unequivocally in support. He follows the old-fashioned
line that it is Congress's duty to support the commander-in-chief.
He hopes to attain that position himself, of course, in a year's time, but
seems to be motivated by genuine principle. His stand has silenced critics in
the Senate - except for the egregious Senator Phil Gramm, who is also running
for president - and even in the House. The speaker, Newt Gingrich, has been
notably and uncharacteristically moderate on the issue.
q Mr Clinton ended his European tour by meeting Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez in Madrid yesterday to sign a wide range of joint aims including
committment of support to the Middle East peace process, development of East
European nations, and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

POOR management skills are often at the root of the problems of many small and
medium sized enterprises (SMEs), inhibiting their growth, according to a new
report from the Confederation of British Industry.
A key weakness identified in the report is the lack of rigorous evaluation of
the different types of support available to SMEs, especially in terms of help
from the Government.
The report, entitled Managing to Grow, says that Business Links, the
one-stop-shop advice centres for small businesses, should play an essential
role in a Government drive to enhance SME management development.
It calls for a number of measures to ensure that Business Links fulfil their
full potential. These include ensuring an adequate level of long-term funding,
the delivery of all Government SME services through Business Links making sure
it represents a true one-stop-shop, the need for large firms, banks, and
accountancy firms to encourage their clients and suppliers to use the service,
and promoting and effectively evaluating the performance of Business Links.
The report recognises that there will only be a limited number of personal
business advisers available through Business Links and proposes the
establishment of a national network of business mentors.
Meanwhile, another report out today claims that more than a quarter of
Britain's 1.2 million limited companies are loss-making while two-thirds of
those are high-risk debtors, potentially unable to fulfill their credit
commitments to suppliers.
The report says that, as a result, many businesses find they are running up bad
debts and jeopardising their own financial stability by supplying goods and
services to customers who are unlikely to pay for them.
ICC, one of the UK's leading providers of company and industry data which
carried out the research, says the findings have grave implications for many
British companies.

Bethlehem, West Bank
THE first of the Palestinian police who will take control of Bethlehem from
Israeli troops by Christmas raised the Palestinian flag today over the biblical
city.
About 400 people, including a uniformed Boy Scout band, turned out to welcome
12 officers who opened the Israel-Palestinian liaison office on a hilltop
overlooking Bethlehem, in the neighbouring village of Beit Jala.
Residents clapped and chanted: ``We will sacrifice soul and blood for
Palestine'' when the officers marched in, carrying handguns, flags, and
pictures of PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
``This is the sweetest moment in my life,'' said Khalil Dakadeka from the
nearby village of Beit Fajjar.
``We have waited for this moment for many years,'' said Bethlehem merchant
Nader Hidweh.
Brigadier General Ziad Atrash, a senior police commander, raised the
Palestinian flag over the liaison office and announced: ``Christmas will be
under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, and Arafat will attend the
ceremonies.''
Thirty thousand people are expected to attend Christmas celebrations in
Bethlehem's Manger Square, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, for the first
Christmas under Palestinian control. In past years, visitors passed through
Israeli metal detectors to reach Manger Square and the Church of the Nativity,
with Israeli army snipers posted on rooftops.
The pull-out from Bethelem is due to be completed on December 18, in time for
Christmas preparations.
Under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in September, Israel is supposed to be
out of six Palestinian cities by the end of the year, and out of Hebron in
March.-AP.

CHANGE has never scared Bill Kane. He has thrived on it from the day he decided
after two years as a young trainee with a Glasgow firm of chartered accountants
and three failed attempts at the taxation exam that his future lay elsewhere.
Now, at 37, he is steering Edinburgh-based paint manufacturers and
wall-covering distributors Craig and Rose, suppliers of paint to the Forth
Bridge, through its most intensive period of change since being established in
1829.
Brought into the company in June as commercial director on a contract that was
initially to last only to the end of this year, Mr Kane was promoted at the end
of October to managing director with a remit to supervise its return to
financial health after being in the red since 1991.
He was brought up in the village of Ferniegair, near Hamilton, and studied
business and accountancy at Bell College. After two years in chartered
accountancy, he spent a year in the internal audit section of the Glasgow
electrical and engineering group James Scott, of Finnieston. In 1984, he joined
the Hertz car rental organisation, working from London on financial and
operation audits throughout Europe.
His next stop was something completely different. In 1991, he was recruited as
finance manager and company secretary of Light and Sound Design, which rented
equipment to rock concert organisers in the UK and the United States, and had
become part of Christian Salvesen.
He became managing director three years later and sold the business on for
Salvesen in May this year, which freed him to join Craig and Rose.
The drive to bring the company out of the red began before Mr Kane arrived. It
had already been decided to close down its loss making depot at Dartford, near
London, a move which has made the major contribution to reducing the workforce
to 70 from an average of 110 last year.
Cost-saving measures have included the shedding of the company's own fleet of
vans and farming out distribution.
Administration and stock control, handled manually until now, is being
computerised. Steps are also in the pipeline to improve sales, particularly in
the north of England, where the company may open a depot, and from the Glasgow
depot in Lawmoor Road, which is likely to be re-sited as the existing premises
are covered by a compulsory purchase order because of the M74 extension.
Mr Kane is particularly proud of the recent refurbishing of the company's Leith
Walk showroom, which he sees not only as an essential step to improve the image
conveyed to customers but as a way of boosting staff morale.

WHEN Primrose McCabe left a large international firm of accountants eight years
ago, she was barred from practising within 10 miles of Edinburgh.
The result was Primrose McCabe &amp; Company being set up in the quiet dormitory
town of Linlithgow.
This did not deter Ms McCabe and she became president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1994 while her firm expanded with two
partners being appointed, Jeffrey Meek in 1989 and Barry Laurie in 1993.
The chartered accountants were involved in ground breaking work with Northern
Venture Managers, helping them to set up Northern Venture Trust, the second in
the country to provide investment capital for small businesses.
Tax partner Mr Laurie helped explain the tax advantages of venture trusts to
potential investors and #14.5m was raised, #3m of it in Scotland.
Northern Venture Trust has already made its first two investments, including
#400,000 in Safe Marine, an Aberdeen based company which makes radar equipment
for oil rigs.
Meanwhile, the accountancy firm is developing its involvement in the hotel
industry where it believes its expertise in tax law can reduce the liability of
hotel groups or obtain refunds.
``We are not saying to the hotels that we should replace their existing
accountants,'' said Ms McCabe, ``but we can go in and out and deal with a
particular tax situation.''
Mr Laurie, who was an tax inspector before qualifying as a chartered
accountant, said: ``Companies who have spent a lot of money on new developments
such as leisure centres should not assume that they have claimed all their tax.
We have recently been involved with an Edinburgh hotel where we will save them
between #50,000 and #100,000, and we recently agreed an increased tax claim for
1979.''

A JEALOUS Filipina wife severed her husband's penis while he slept after she
learned he was having an affair with another woman.
Sales agent Ernesto Redito, 45, felt pain in his groin when he awoke on Friday
in his house in Plaridel town and screamed when he saw his sex organ had been
cut off, reported the newspaper Tempo. ``I could not stand his philandering any
more,'' Redito's wife Eva told police.
She finally decided to do something on learning the other woman was pregnant,
the paper said.
Doctors at the hospital where Redito was taken were still considering whether
the severed organ could be re-attached. The report did not say if Redito would
press charges.
The incident was the latest of several cases of Filipinas cutting their
husband's penises to be reported since last year's case involving US manicurist
Lorena Bobbitt, who severed her husband's organ in retaliation for sexual
assaults.
q The Philippines has filed a Bill banning morticians from hospitals. MP
Reynaldo Calalay denounced as ``vultures'' the agents of funeral parlours who
sit around waiting for news of a death.-Reuter.

AS representatives in Scotland of major overseas aid agencies, we are dismayed
that the issue of aid cuts has now come so far down the agenda of public
interest that it was not even mentioned in your paper.
In the Budget an aid cut of 5.4% (6.7% in real terms) was imposed which will be
a real blow for some of the world's poorest people. Compared with plans
announced in last year's Budget, aid in 1996/97 will be cut by #124m in cash
terms - from #2278m to #2154m.
The money being cut would be enough to fund the combined programmes in Africa
of six of the largest UK aid agencies, but the money the Treasury will save
will only be worth an extra 16 pence a week off the income-tax bill of someone
on average earnings.
This level of cut does not reflect public opinion. A recent Harris opinion poll
which told people that the Government spends only 31p in every #100 of national
wealth on overseas aid, found that 79% of respondents thought that this amount
should stay the same or be increased while only 10% favoured cuts.
The aid cuts will severely damage some of the best parts of Britain's aid
programme for the sake of a few pence in the average pay packet.

TURNING vision into reality is the phrase which architects and planning
consultants, Holmes Partnership, consider summarises succinctly what they are
all about.
Currently they are celebrating the manifestation of their own vision: a
prestigious yet good value building at 89 Minerva Street, for their Glasgow
practice, custom-built to their own design. It was officially opened last week
by Malcolm Campbell, president of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
``There are many reasons why we moved from our old offices in Kelvingrove
Street,'' said managing partner Robin Th'ng. ``Most of our clients and
colleagues are in the West End of Glasgow. We wanted to be around this area
rather than in the city centre. We have car parking, and it is very accessible
from the motorway, both from Edinburgh - where we also have an office - and the
city.
``We have been able to design, develop and build exactly what we want. How we
work is how we create, so that's very important.''
The two-storey rectangularly shaped building has been kept to the rear of the
site, with car parking to the front. The simple design has been given added
interest by the glazed front wall having been set at a slight angle, while the
oversailing roof's aerofoil eaves detail - echoed in the smaller roof over the
entrance lobby - forms a skyline the dynamics of which become more striking the
closer visitors get to the front door.
At ground level, wide glass doors lead into a pale, elegantly appointed
reception foyer and exhibition area where generous use has been made of natural
timber. On either side are two meeting rooms, while to the rear are the
administration area, storerooms, kitchen and toilets.
The exhibition space, in addition to displaying the practice's projects, ``will
be used,'' Dr Th'ng explains, ``to exhibit interesting things that are going
on. When it comes to Glasgow's Door Open day each year, we will be open to the
public and, for example, we will sponsor students, and enable them to show
their work as part of our philosophy, and as a contribution to the community.''
The first-floor level is an entirely open-plan office studio with a wall of
windows to the west and rooflights to the rear, combining to make an
exceptionally bright workplace.
An electronic trade and reference library coupled with other CAD/IT systems
have reduced the necessity for hard copy storage and shelving.
The seven partners at Holmes would like to think, says Robin Th'ng: ``that we
were the trendsetters in our business rather than trend followers. We are
innovators, and we like to think that we are the leaders in our field in
Scotland.
``In our use of technology too, we are creators. There is not a single drawing
board in our offices. I can't think of another practice in Scotland which can
claim that. We are full on CAD and fully into all sorts of IT in terms of using
PCs to communicate throughout our offices with our colleagues and our clients.
``What is important is that we are still very creative in our design approach.
We have that creativity together with the technology. We are also very
conscious of issues, such as environmentally friendly buildings, of which much
has been preached, but little done.
``Our own building we are proud of, we describe it as very environmentally
friendly. This is illustrated by the fact that the building's performance
attains the standard ``very good'' when calculated using the BRE Environmental
Assessment method. The building is very easy also for wheelchair users or
disabled people, being entirely level from the car park and throughout the
ground floor.''
The Holmes Partnership's two practices are run as one unit, partners in the
West also work on projects in the East and vice-versa. ``Ours is a very
dynamic, exciting partnership,'' enthuses Dr Th'ng. ``It is a great advantage
to be able to do what you want to do, enjoy it and also get a reward. We have
been fortunate to have kept busy throughout the recession, despite the
construction industry having suffered badly.
``Our new building is a reflection of all that, it is making a statement, and
it is our own little contribution towards Glasgow's 1999 City of Architecture
and Design.''
Robin Th'ng has been the managing partner of both the Glasgow and Edinburgh
offices for nine years. He said: ``As a practice we are very focussed in what
we want to do. The areas in which we specialise are urban design, urban
renewal, planning work, commercial work, educational projects and residential
projects.
``Our clients often come to us and say: ``We have a vision,'' and indeed they
do. We have to make that into a reality - that is fundamentally our role.''
Among some of the high profile examples of the work of The Holmes Partnership
is the distinctive office building at 100 Bothwell Street, Glasgow, designed
for a London developer; the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise Building on
Dundee's Riverfront; the newly-completed #2.5m refurbishment of the Bank of
Scotland's flagship branch in the West of Scotland at the corner of Glasgow's
Queen Street and Ingram Street; the new #12.5m Royal Mail centre opposite the
M8 Interchange on the Edinburgh City by-pass; and the recently-completed
refurbishment of the University of Glasgow's large sports and recreation
building.
Again for the university, Holmes' mixed skills are demonstrated well by two
projects: a Victorian listed terrace of some 11 units which is being converted
to a department of computing science. Every room and wall has been opened in
order to create one single building, while retaining the original facade and a
number of outstanding features.
A recent project is the addition of a 12th floor and new roof to the lofty
tower which is the university library. Work for housing associations;
restoration, including the on-going restoring of Laurieston House in Carlton
Place, Glasgow, for a Government organisation; public housing and private
clients; projects for health boards, often in the planning and development of
redundant hospital sites; and work for local enterprise companies, district or
regional councils, are all part of Holmes' project portfolio.
The seven widely experienced partners in the Holmes Partnership are: Robin
Th'ng, BArch, PhD, FRIAS, RIBA, FIMgt, ACIArb. Charles Strong, BArch, FRIAS,
RIBA. Harold Phillips, BArch, FRIAS, RIBA, MSAI. Neil Maxwell, BSc, BArch,

<TEXT>
CALEDONIAN MacBrayne is at the centre of a storm over the speed of its car and
passenger vessels entering and leaving west coast harbours.
It is claimed that bow waves from the ferry operator's ships are causing damage
to yachts and that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously
injured.
Two vessels - the Lord of the Isles and the Isle of Mull, both of which operate
the Oban to Mull service - are the target of complaints from private boat
owners. Yachtsmen say the speed of the ferries as they enter and leave Oban
harbour is excessive and is causing huge bow waves that have:
q Caused more than #1000 of damage to two yachts tied alongside each other;
q Torn the deck mountings off a 30ft motor cruiser tied to a pontoon; and
q Almost washed 12 people off a pontoon as they waited for an island ferry.
Despite mounting complaints to HM Coastguard, pier masters and the police, and
letters to the company, boat owners say Caledonian MacBrayne skippers are
refusing to slow down.
Private boats using pontoons in Rothesay harbour on the Isle of Bute have also
experienced severe wave motion as the Wemyss Bay ferry approaches.
Retired Merchant Navy officer Alex Clark, from Tain, in Ross and Cromarty, says
CalMac are a ``law unto themselves'' when it comes to the high seas.
He said: ``We know that ferry captains have timetables to keep, but so has the
70,000-ton QE2, but when she came into the Cromarty Firth recently there was
hardly a ripple.
``This battle with CalMac at Oban has been going on for years but it is getting
worse, but it will only be time before someone is seriously injured.''
In one incident at Oban Yacht Club, a member's dog was catapulted from the
boat's wheelhouse into the sea when the wash from the ferry struck. Paint tins
were spilled over the yacht's decks. The dog was saved.
Yachtsmen were amazed, however, when, earlier this year the Queen arrived in
Oban aboard Britannia. The CalMac ferry entered the harbour area without a wave
in sight, according to locals.
Caledonian MacBrayne is unrepentant, saying that its Oban-Mull ferries each
displace about 3000 tons of water and this has to go somewhere, according to
Captain Sandy Ferguson, a former captain on the Oban-Mull route, now marine
superintendent for CalMac.
He said: ``I was master of the Isle of Mull vessel for the past four years, and
I know what it's all about. Our ferries slow right down on their approach to
Oban, and by the time they get to the entrance they are doing five knots at the
most and decelerating.
``We are responsible people and all our masters approach every harbour at a
prudent speed, but unfortunately there will always be a certain amount of wash
from a ferry.
``We get yachtsmen complaining almost on a weekly basis that CalMac ferries
have damaged their boats. This is particularly frequent at Oban. But we do not
accept any claims whatsoever and we will fight every case put to us.
``The last person who took us to court two years ago withdrew on the courtroom
steps, as he could not prove we caused the damage to his boat. He had to pay
our legal costs.''
The Royal Highland Yacht Club, based at Oban, has written to Caledonian
MacBrayne, raising the concerns of its members and other yachtsmen sailing on
the west coast.

THE world's first statue of Bonnie Prince Charlie on horseback was unveiled in
the centre of Derby yesterday - after a battle against public apathy.
The statue was commissioned to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the retreat
of The Young Pretender from the city, the most southerly point the Jacobites
reached in the ill-fated 1745 uprising.
After an inital slow start to an appeal, the #100,000 cost has been met
entirely by public subscription, mainly from the chairman of Derby County
Football Club, Mr Lionel Pickering.
The statue has been placed outside Derby Cathedral, where the prince went to a
thanksgiving service when he arrived in the city.
It was occupied by the prince and his army of 5000 Scottish and English troops
for two nights and three days before a fateful decision to turn back
effectively ended the Jacobite cause.
The bronze statue on a stone plinth was a joint effort between Bristol-based
sculptor Anthony Stones and bronze worker Rungwe Kingdon.
Twelve pipers and members of the Charles Edward Stuart Society dressed in
period costume stood in ceremony as it was unveiled by Lady Scarsdale, whose
husband's ancestors played host to the prince when he arrived in Derby 250
years ago.
Lady Scarsdale said: ``Our family is proud of its association with the
Jacobites and I'm sure the statue will become enormously popular as the Bonnie
Prince Charlie story is known throughout the world.''

COUNCILLOR Cathie Craigie's second attempt to pour cold water over me (Letters,
November 24) very effectively endorses my case.
The Labour Party was never off the media demanding action for the speedy
implementation of the Nolan Report which demanded the full disclosure of
Parliamentary allowances and income associated with the MPs' salaries.
It has been as silent as the grave in pressing for a similar inquiry in local
government - indeed no date has been published for such an inquiry. With good
reason!
In April 1992 the Secretary of State cut the proportion of special
responsibility allowance from 25% to 10% because there was clear evidence that
the Labour councils would not give a fair proportion of the allocated sum to
minority parties.
To quote one example, North Lanarkshire Council, on which Councillor Craigie
also serves, has 69 councillors being paid #6000 a year basic allowance, a
total of #414,000. Twenty-nine Labour councillors, including Councillor
Craigie, in addition share special responsibility allowances of #254,000.
The sole responsibility allowance paid to the minority is one ``Leader's
allowance'' of #4800.
The special responsibility allowances amount to 62.5% of the council's basic
allowances.
The minority parties who represeent well over 30% of the electorate receive
just over 1% of the basic allowances.
This of course takes no account of the very generous expenses and perks which I
have previously pointed out. These more than double Councillor Craigie's basic
and special responsibility allowances in 1994/95 as leader of Cumbernauld and
Kilsyth District Council.

A YOUNG sculptor's plan to move the statue of the Duke of Wellington from
Glasgow`s Royal Exchange Square and replace it with a 40ft statue of a potato
snack is a non-starter - because it would cost too much.
Artist Derek Beggs is believed to have made a planning application to Glasgow
District Council suggesting the Iron Duke be moved to another site to make way
for his crispy snack because the duke is a target for merrymakers who
continually place a traffic cone on his head.
But last night his idea was knocked firmly on the head by Mr Julian Spalding,
the city's director of museums. He said: ``For a start, it would be a massive
building operation to move the duke and would cost far too much, well into six
figures.''
He admitted he would like to see the statue moved from the front of the Gallery
of Modern Art, which opens next February, and added: ``There is certainly
competition to put a cone on his head and I would like to find a way of
stopping this.''
A spokesman for the city council said last night that he could neither confirm
nor deny that Mr Beggs had made a planning application.

<HEADLINE>Trade standholders pleased with the number of visitors and quality of enquiries Successful DairyScot secures future</HEADLINE>

IT was an eventful week last week, with three days at Earls Court for the new
Smithfield FarmTech show - and then straight off the plane at Edinburgh to
visit DairyScot at Ingliston.
They were two contrasting events, and if you were asked to put money on which
one would survive it would be DairyScot. That is not to criticise the
Smithfield event but simply a comment on the fact that DairyScot had a lively
buzz to it while FarmTech was more laid back.
Space had a lot to do with it, of course. At Earls Court the show was spread
over a four-acre site and attracted 11,500 visitors over three days. It was
confined to one hall, never felt crowded and, at times, looked sparse compared
with the bustle of the traditional Smithfield Show which takes over the whole
exhibition centre on several floors.
The DairyScot attendance was 3200 in one day and trade standholders were
pleased with the numbers of visitors and the quality of enquiries. Management
committee chairman Alex Brown was able to announce that the event's future had
been secured for the next four years. The Bank of Scotland has agreed to repeat
its sponsorship next year and Mr Brown was confident that the bank would want
to remain on board beyond that.
The Smithfield organisers say that they exceeded their attendance target of
10,000 - at #8 a head - and although it is too early for firm decisions to be
made, the indications are that the exercise will be repeated in 1997.
The reason why there has to be a ``big'' and a ``small'' Smithfield is that the
machinery manufacturers and distributors have decided to make their
participation biennial. This suits their plan to concentrate on a European
circuit of leading events. The consensus view was that they had rather shot
themselves in the foot this year. The arable sector has generally enjoyed good
returns, and good orders would have been ripe for the picking at a traditional
Smithfield.
The absence may actually have done farmers a favour. The message at the show
from one farm business consultant was that the conventional wheeze of buying
expensive machinery as a way of diverting cash away from the tax man is of
doubtful wisdom.
Simon Mountjoy, of Leicester, said that his advice to clients was ``pay the
tax''. He sees the tax regime as benign and profits as historically high in
real terms.
On capital expenditure of #30,000 for a new tractor the first year write-down
allowance would be 25%, giving a total tax saving of #3000 at the higher tax
rate of 40% - only 10% of the capital sum spent. The message, he said, is to
have the right machine in the right place at the right time and not to confuse
effective planning and utilisation of labour and machinery with taxation.
Effective planning, he suggested, would increase profits and actually
exacerbate the tax situation. But he added, drily, that anyone not paying tax
should seriously consider whether they have long-term viability.
Simon's partner, Ian Youdan, reported that farmers were not ready sellers of
land at the moment - although the same could not be said of the financial
institutions. They were seeing price levels as an opportunity to get out of an
investment medium with which they had become increasingly uncomfortable. His
experience is that agricultural investment requires a level of intensive
management which many institutions feel unable to deliver when their own
management facilities are being slimmed down dramatically.
Finally, as Charlie Allan is not reporting on the après-show high jinks at
Smithfield, I can lift just a corner of the veil which is, quite properly,
drawn over the activities of the Scottish press corps.
There is a traditional Sunday night visit to a Chinese restaurant. It fell to
one of our more responsible colleagues to organise the transport and, after
commandeering two taxis, he proceeded to give the most detailed directions he
could muster: ``The Mayflower - it's a Chinese restaurant.'' Full credit to the
London cabby, he got us to the right one.
Once there we found the waiter more anxious about establishing our need for
drink rather than food. His efforts were misdirected, as the need for liquid
refreshment had been attended to - as he might have observed. Eventually one of
our number conceded: ``OK, bring us four bottles of your best white wine.''
``Are you sure sir? Our best wine is #28 a bottle.''
``Oh very well, then - four bottles of house white.''
A compromise, yes. But accomplished with panache.

KVAERNER chairman Erik Tonseth has made it very clear that the acquisition of
Amec, for which the company has bid a contested #1 a share, is crucial to the
Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering group's long-term future.
Last week, he expressed disappointment that he had not been able to restart
discussions with Amec's Sir Alan Cockshaw after the initial meeting on November
23. That was after the dawn raid made on the advice of advisers SBC Warburg
when Kvaerner raised its stake of several months' standing from 2% to 12%.
Perhaps more important than the benefits from the takeover, Amec would provide
Kvaerner with a British passport. Mr Tonseth regards that as essential for
international expansion, particularly in Asia, where the UK has diplomatic and
financial clout which Norway conspicuously lacks.
He is still upset that Amec's brief flirtation with Alfred McAlpine valued
Amec's shares at just 70p or so, compared with the 100p that he paid. The Amec
feelers were almost immediately rejected by McAlpine which is now seeking to
beef up its board through the reported recruitment of Rolls-Royce chief
executive Sir Terence Harrison as chairman to succeed Sir John Milne.
Kvaerner has argued there is strong industrial logic in putting the two
together. It is a world leader in sub-sea structures whereas Amec has a
powerful position in rig topsides. More importantly, it has the construction
and contracting skills necessary to complete major turnkey projects for both
fuelled and hydro-electric power stations.
Co-operation at present extends to a joint venture bid for a major US contract
where Kvaerner would provide the equipment and Amec would be in overall charge
of construction.
Mr Tonseth, 49, joined Kvaerner seven years ago after it became clear he would
not get the top job at Norsk Hydro. He has been known as Norway's only rugby
player but he said he was trying to forget that, particularly as the match was
in Sweden.
If the bid does succeed, an increasing proportion of Kvaerner's international
business will come to Britain. Mr Tonseth added that the Sea Launch floating
platform project should be finalised within the next three weeks. That
envisages a platform costing over #60m to be built at Kvaerner's Govan shipyard
to provide a base for satellite launch rockets in the Pacific.
The finance is in place but there are still difficulties with the US
authorities over the relationship between Boeing and the Russian and Ukrainian
rocket companies.
This is a revolutionary development and Mr Tonseth said that it would be very
good for Scottish industry.
In a letter to Amec shareholders, Kvaerner stressed the offer was final and
would not be increased unless a rival bidder emerged. It said: ``Your board has
talked about the `true value of Amec's potential' but has not provided any
facts in support. In considering whether to accept our offer, you should
contrast the certainty of our 100p per share in cash now with the uncertain
future value of Amec's shares.
``The difficulty of assessing that future has already been reflected in Alfred
McAlpine's speedy rejection of your board's offer to acquire the company and
that offer itself indicates that your board considers the Amec should not
continue on its own in its present form.''
Kvaerner has steadily increased its stake in Amec following its hostile bid
last week by buying shares in the market and now speaks for 18.1%.

CATERER Liz McAreavey has come a long way since she opened Le Bistro takeaway
delicatessen in Edinburgh's West End eight years ago. Today she runs a rapidly
expanding outside catering empire.
Earlier this year, Le Bistro Caterers fed more than 7000 visitors to the Tall
Ships Race and it was the Le Bistro which ensured construction workers building
the new Scottish Office did not go hungry.
``The takeaway deli is a very small part of our business,'' said managing
director Ms McAreavey, ``but people still perceive us as a takeaway deli and it
is a perception which we are trying to overcome.''
Le Bistro Caterers is planning to expand into commercial contract catering. ``I
believe that this is an area which is ripe for expansion we are talking to
several companies,'' she said.
The expansion has meant the company is now looking for larger premises, despite
the fact that it only moved into its present premises at Bonnington Mill
Business Centre a few months ago.
``I thought we would be settled their for at least 18 months but we have
outgrown it already,'' said Ms McAreavey.
Le Bistro can find itself providing food for a dozen different functions in a
single day, and this requires a great deal of organisation. ``Until 18 months
ago, you could have found me behind the till at our takeaway but I now realise
that this is not the best use of my time, and that I cannot do everything
myself,'' she said.
Le Bistro Caterers is often used by the Scottish Office to cater for functions
in the Great Hall of Edinburgh Castle and Ms McAreavey admits the guest lists
often frightens her. ``I often get nervous when I see who we will be serving,
so I try not to bother looking.''
To ensure VIP guests are not disappointed with the food, Le Bistro Caterers has
hired top chefs James Davie and Marcus Lane.
Mr Davie was head chef at Prestonfield House Hotel and also worked on the QE2
while Mr Lane has worked at Gleneagles, the Ritz, and the Savoy.
``We try to make sure that our food matches venues such as the Signet Library
and the Great Hall but, whatever we are preparing, whether it be bacon and eggs
for construction workers or a delicacy for a visiting politician, we try to
ensure that it is top quality,'' said Ms McAreavey.

THE only reason I dislike having to go to my building society office - apart

What powers these employers have and exert - why? Presumably they think their

definitely wrong.
I wonder why they bother to put first names at the windows. With these

ONE of the great aims of devolution is to give Scotland a measure of modern,
accountable government; to remove, if you like, the democratic deficit. Yet if
democracy is to be brought to the governance of Scottish affairs it should be a
grown-up democracy, not a nappied affair which must grow whiskers before it can
be treated like an adult, nor one which cannot change its mind in the course of
time if circumstances warrant. Tony Blair's remarkable interview in this
newspaper appears to point to a vision of a Scottish Assembly which must seek a
mandate before each term for the revenue-raising powers which will make it
worth while. In the absolute sense there is nothing wrong with this. Any party
seeking the support of the electorate should be prepared to set out its views
and intentions as far as the latter can be ascertained in advance. In this Mr
Blair is returning to his familiar theme of the tax promises made by the Tory
Government and subsequently broken.
Yet he appears to wish to take this particular line of thinking further. He
seems intent on launching his party into the first election for a Scottish
Assembly with a manifesto which will not advocate a tax increase. Moreover, in
line with his detestation of promises made and broken, the logical inference of
this is that a Labour administration leading a Scottish Assembly and elected on
a no-tax-raising platform would not raise taxes during the term of the
Assembly, no matter what happens. We can sympathise with Mr Blair's intentions
here. Undoubtedly he wants to consign Michael Forsyth's ``Tartan Tax'' campaign
to the region of tabloid ghouls and hobgoblins which it should rightly inhabit,
yet in doing so he has indicated his unease with the success of Mr Forsyth's
propaganda, and in an important sense he has surrendered some of the initiative
to his opponent.
Other things will follow from Mr Blair's latest thoughts. If a Labour
administration is elected on the basis already described and leads, perhaps in
coalition, a Scottish Assembly it will find itself in hideous difficulties if a
need should arise suddenly to raise or lower taxes. This could be envisaged in
the context of a crisis in Scottish education which might necessitate urgent
revenue. Under Mr Blair's plan the only thing that the Labour administration
could do in these circumstances would be to fall on its sword, dissolve the
Assembly, and call a fresh election with a platform seeking raised (or in other
circumstances, lowered) taxes. This is certainly direct democracy, but so
direct that it would be painful. Presumably Mr Blair does not intend that the
Westminster Parliament should adopt these rules. How would Chancellor Brown
react if he had to call a General Election every time he wished to raise or
lower taxes?
At first glance Mr Blair is not trying to redraft the proposals of the
Constitutional Convention; he is saying merely that his party will behave in a
certain way. Yet the effect of this, given Labour's popularity in Scotland, is
effectively to alter the manner in which any Assembly will function. In this
respect his views are bound to be seen as taking the entire affair backwards,
and they will undoubtedly infuriate the many allies who worked with Labour on
the formation of the proposals for an Assembly. What Mr Blair is proposing is
certainly clever. He hopes it will demolish the ``Tartan Tax'' offensive; and
it will probably help him convince those English Labour MPs who harbour doubts
about devolution. He is entitled to do it because he commits nobody other than
his own party, yet it is disruptive and regressive and ultimately unhelpful.

<HEADLINE>Meeting scheduled as secret hospital visits to talk to dying patients are disclosed Princess's role on Major agenda</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975061011</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE future public role of the Princess of Wales is widely expected to be
discussed at a meeting on Tuesday between the Queen and John Major.
The meeting comes less than a week after the princess sat down with Buckingham
Palace courtiers to put forward her own ideas on her future in the wake of her
dramatic Panorama interview.
It also follows a poll showing that seven out of 10 people support her wish to
be ``queen of hearts'', and the disclosure that she is making late-night visits
to sick and dying hospital patients.
Tuesday's meeting is the traditional routine weekly briefing in which the Prime
Minister visits the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
Both Downing Street and the Palace were yesterday sticking to the rule that no
comment is made about discussions between the Prime Minister and members of the
royal family.
But one Sunday newspaper reported that a new role for the princess was to be
discussed at the meeting. It said there was ``growing nervousness'' among some
Ministers about the possibility of giving her any formal ambassadorial role.
Buckingham Palace confirmed that a meeting was held last week between the
34-year-old princess and senior figures in the Queen's household, although a
spokesman would not give details.
The talks had not taken place in an atmosphere of confrontation, and were
``perfectly amicable'', he said. Further meetings were likely.
This was in line with the palace's announcement after the BBC Panorama
interview that ``we would be talking to the princess again about helping her to
define her future role, and asking in what way we could continue to help her'',
he said.
One paper reported that the princess made a series of demands - for a new image
for the monarchy and for her crowd-pulling potential to be recognised ``and not
derided from within Buckingham Palace''.
Meanwhile, the princess was spotted outside a London hospital in the early
hours of one morning, and explained how she loved helping patients come to
terms with their suffering and loneliness, said the News of the World.
She said of the sick and dying people she visits: ``Some will live and some
won't. But they all need to be loved while they are here.''
Dressed in her baseball cap and jeans, she said she wore a disguise and visited
at night to avoid attention and problems for the hospitals.
``There are hundreds of patients who are there without their own loved ones and
they need a human presence.
``I hold their hands, talk to them, tell them that everyone is on their side,
whatever helps.''
The NOP survey for the Sunday Times showed that, since her Panorama interview,
the princess had attracted more public sympathy.
Two weeks ago only 27% of people had sympathy for her, but the figure has risen
now to 39%.
The Prince of Wales's sympathy rating has dropped, from 10% to 8%. Another 21%
have equal support for the estranged couple while 32% - down from 40% - say
neither has their vote.
Only 36% want the princess to be queen but 50% do not, while 14% don't know.
The poll of 1035 voters was taken on Thursday and Friday.
.q.The Duchess of York has struck up a friendship with a gypsy artist and is
mounting an exhibition of his paintings. She met Paul Gaisford while holidaying
in Spain with her husband and children and became a great fan of his work.
Now she is hoping to win the black-haired 54-year-old a wider audience by
organising a display at Kensington Palace and a top London gallery.
The duchess was on holiday with the duke and their daughters in Seville near
where Mr Gaisford had been giving painting classes.
She was immediately impressed by his oil-paintings of gypsy wagons, flamenco
dancers and men with dogs.
Explaining her passion for his work, she said: ``You can't talk about Paul's
work in generalised terms as it is so diversified. But I like his use of light
and his sense of magic. I see huge depth and inspiration.''
The duchess, who has been taking art appreciation classes with a leading London
art dealer for five years, said of her hobby: ``I'm learning brushstrokes. My
grandmother paints rather nicely and it is from her side that I am a little bit
creative. I certainly have a very vivid imagination.''
The artist has been described as ``a bit of a rough diamond'' by some, and by
the duchess's aides as ``a non-verbal personality''.
His friendship with the duchess has spurred him to great activity, painting 76
works in three months in preparation for the show, which can be seen at the Roy
Miles Gallery, in London's Bruton Street, from December 14 to 16.
The artist will donate part of the proceeds of the display to Children in
Crisis, a charity which the duchess set up in 1993.

Police trace
escapee Moore
ESCAPED psychiatric patient Robert Moore was last night back in custody after
being traced by police to Manchester. A nationwide search was launched after
Moore, 52, went missing from Dykebar Hospital in Paisley on Thursday night.
In 1971 he was acquitted of murder on the grounds of insanity and committed to
hospital without limit of time. The Scottish Office warned that while his
recent behaviour did not cause significant concern Moore could be a danger in
certain circumstances. He was transferred to Dykebar from the State Hospital at
Carstairs in 1993.
Rape charge
A MAN is due to appear in court at Dunoon today, charged with raping a

Council renamed
DUMBARTON and Clydebank Council, which takes control of both towns on April 1,
is to be re-named West Dunbartonshire Council. This follows a plea to schools
and community groups for suggestions.

THE fact that John MacLeod has got his facts wrong time and time again in the
past never really seems to discourage him (November 28).
There is no tradition in Roman Catholicism of the Pope or the Church being
infallible in everything and anything. There does exist a Doctrine of Papal
Infallibility, which applies only to certain pronouncements on faith or morals,
but this has been invoked only once, in 1950, by Pope Pius XII.
The Catholic Church rightly views the sacrament of marriage as holy and
indissoluble but, in Scotland at least, understands that for many reasons two
people may find it impossible to continue living together as man and wife, and
not necessarily because of the ``fault'' of one partner.
It does deny them certain (but not all) other sacraments, but this does not
extend to excommunication.
As for annulments, these can be notoriously difficult to obtain - Henry VIII of
England is one example - and the process can take up to 10 years or more.
Hardly an alternative to a ``quickie'' divorce.
Things might be better if in future John Macleod kept his writings confined to
topics closer to his own Free Church tradition, rather than using them to voice
his own personal religious prejudices. All your readers, Catholic and
non-Catholic alike, would say ``amen'' to that!

I FIND that instances of manifest injustice in Scotland are more and more
difficult to bear. People seem to be sent to prison far too often for far too
long. We have the highest prison population in Europe.
I write because it is our MP, Menzies Campbell QC, who appears to be associated
with the latest injustice, which concerns the footballer Duncan Ferguson.
On November 8 a three-man appeals tribunal, chaired by North-east Fife MP
Menzies Campbell, decided against the appeal by Mr Ferguson for his 12-match
football ban to run concurrently with his prison sentence.
Mr Ferguson has thus been punished three times for the same offence of
head-butting while playing for Rangers. He has been sent to prison. He has been
banned from playing football by virtue of his imprisonment. And he has been
banned by the SFA after his release from prison on November 22.
The effect of the appeal tribunal decision is that Mr Ferguson will not play
football until January 22, 1996. Mr Ferguson would have otherwise been able to
resume football on November 25, if concurrent punishments had been allowed for
the same offence by the tribunal.
In my view, leaving aside the selective prosecution of Mr Ferguson, and other
curious anomalies, it was a pity that Mr Ferguson was not allowed to do
community service - as Eric Cantona did for a worse assault - for his crime,
instead of receiving a prison sentence.
One worthy national newspaper concluded that our MP's tribunal was ``silly and
vindictive'' and that Scotland ``certainly does not need any lessons in the law
from Nigeria''.
I despair that so-called Liberals still seem to think that harsh punishments
are a ``good thing''. Harsh punishments did not work when another Liberal
administration executed leaders of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916. Harsh
punishments have not worked anywhere else. They have brought forth hatred,
embitterment, a feeling of revenge, and an ``intifada''.
It is mercy, magnanimity, gentleness, love and offering people a better way
which heals and which binds people together in unity, harmony, and obedience.

TO follow on from George C Train's letter (November 27) about CalMac's
withdrawal of catering services from Clyde ferries, the only reason there might
be a need for catering services is that the journey from Gourock to Dunoon
takes so long.
I wouldn't use CalMac's ferry to get to Cowal, catering or not. The Western
Ferries service to Hunter's Quay is quicker, more frequent, and carries

THE political imperatives were clear and the required measures simple and
defensible: that is what the French government thought when it unveiled a
package of tough reforms designed to remove the welfare system's deficit and to
meet the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary reform. It was a gamble
in a country which has long cherished both its public sector and a
comprehensive welfare system of some generosity; and it is a gamble which the
government of Mr Alain Juppe may yet live to regret.
The rapid spread of strikes and unrest on the streets appears to have taken the
government by surprise. It seems likely that the authorities will attempt to
provide alternative transport, whether in buses or lorries, in an attempt to
circumvent the latest round of strikes planned for today. The reform package is
deeply unpopular in France. French unions are not particularly strong but
opinion polls indicate widespread support for the strikers and suggest that at
least two-thirds of French adults have no confidence in Mr Juppe's ability to
resolve the argument. His case has not been helped by President Chirac, thought
to be enthusiastically in favour of reform, who adroitly removed himself over
the weekend to an obscure conference in Africa. Nor has the beleaguered Mr
Juppe been able to say much for himself in recent days. His hope must be that
the general public will tire of the chaos and unrest, but he cannot be sure of
this. Nor has he an avenue of escape, for the government's credibility on the
foreign exchanges depends on its ability to see the reforms through and to cut
the deficit. These are hard times for the French government, but they are
self-inflicted in the sense that a more gentle approach might have brought
incremental reforms with less political danger.

ANY peace process, but particularly the Northern Ireland peace process, needs a
lightness of spirit and warmth occasionally to break through the grey tones of
which it seems predominantly constituted. The public aspects of President
Clinton's visit provided that warmth and they were in their way quite as
important as the serious behind-scenes pressure and diplomacy which the
Washington administration has applied to all concerned. There has been carping
at President Clinton but his recent involvement has been creative, even
although it was not always so in the past, and there are hopes that he and
those around him who deal with Northern Ireland now have a clearer
understanding of the realities which apply there.
Nevertheless, the festival atmosphere has gone and if the peace is to be
maintained there must be a forward progress, however painful and however slow.
The invitations to the preparatory talks have gone out and the international
commission headed by Mr George Mitchell must begin its task soon if it is to
report by the middle of January. Although the involvement of Washington has
clearly given some of the participants the confidence to continue it is obvious
that the problem of weapons will not go away.
Mr Major remains convinced that proper negotiations with Sinn Fein will not
begin until the IRA has at least made a start at divesting itself of weapons
and he is right in maintaining this position. In that respect Mr Gerry Adams's
assertion yesterday that any twin-track process is useless if it contains
preconditions is notably unhelpful. If he is prejudging what will happen over
the next few weeks he is making a serious mistake. Nor does the Ulster Unionist
leader, Mr David Trimble, have good news to report. He tried to persuade
loyalist paramilitaries to make the first move on disarmament but has been
rebuffed, thereby enabling the loyalists to show themselves to be as
wrong-headed as the IRA. The grey shadows are back but it is not time for
despair. The second peaceful Christmas is almost upon us and one of the
messages it will bring is the need for hopeful persistence, and the ultimate
triumph of light over dark.

THAT Was A Good Week To Be An Aberdonian That Was. After too many years in the
wilderness, the football team from Pittodrie went to Hampden Park last Sunday
and won the Coca-Cola Cup, reviving memories of life as it used to be.
It might not have been the vintage champagne of Gothenburg (1983), when the
Dons were masters of Europe, but the softest of drinks is a gift from above
when your throat is parched and your soul is weary.
But in terms of Aberdonianism, I have to say, the memorable nature of last week
did not depend upon football alone. Given my devotion to the round-ball game,
it tells you something when I say there was an experience even more exquisite
than the cup final.
I went back to the Granite City for the farewell performance of Scotland The
What?, that unique trio of bow-tie entertainers who have been together for
close on 40 years. And what a night it was!
It had all begun in the magnificence of His Majesty's in Aberdeen - and that
was where it ended, in one of the most emotional nights ever seen in a British
theatre. After a month-long run in their native city, Buff Hardie, Steve
Robertson, and George Donald came out to yet another remarkable house, packed
from stalls through dress-circle and upper-circle to the utmost rafter of the
gods.
They aroused tears of laughter before taking us, with a parody of Rod Stewart's
We Are Sailing, to the humorous but deeply touching conclusion that We Are
Failing.
The audience was in a mood to call its denial of lines like ``We're a hat-trick
. . . of geriatrics'' but not to deny the brilliance of Buff Hardie's lyrics,
which are worthy of a public far beyond Scotland.
And when that dreaded final curtain prepared to drop, the reticence of the
Aberdonian race fell apart in a display of affection which would not have been
matched for the great Harry Gordon of a previous generation.
For Scotland The What?, still fresh-looking men but now touching the sixties,
had become legends well inside their own lifetime, blending talents of comic
genius with the brilliance of George Donald at the piano.
So the audience got to its feet - and stood for a good 10 minutes of unashamed
adulation. Buff, Steve, and George seemed bewildered by the demonstration and
then, with a kind of old-fashioned courtesy, they turned towards each other and
exchanged handshakes.
Evidently, throughout their career, this has been a ritual in the wings before
they took the stage. But it was the first time the audience had seen it - and
there wasn't a dry eye in the house.
When we finally let them go, the audience hung around the bars and the foyer in
a last gesture of savouring a memorable night. For an occasion like this
becomes a milestone in your own life. And it was certainly a milestone in mine.
Back at the farewell party in Poldino's, when asked to round it off with a few
words, I recalled that I had first met up with Buff Hardie, the writing brain
of the team, when we were 12-year-olds at Gordon's College, Aberdeen.
From football in the playground, we graduated to the school play called The
Auld Hoose, the story of Robert Gordon, in which Buff and I played out a scene
together. The poignancy of all this was that I had witnessed his very first
appearance on a stage - and now I had witnessed his farewell 50 years later.
A brilliant academic, Buff Hardie went on to Cambridge University but continued
to write the students' shows back home in Aberdeen. In the mid-1950s he teamed
up with Steve Robertson, a leading light of student comedy, and then with
George Donald, whose music added another dimension.
After university they became the Aberdeen Revue Group but, as professional men
with other careers, decided to call it a day in 1969, with a farewell show at
the Edinburgh Festival.
By then a feature writer on the Daily Express, I suggested to my colleague,
Neville Garden, that he might want to review it.
Neville went - and wrote that this was the funniest show of the Fringe. From
then on it was packed out, with such an overwhelming reaction that the three
Aberdonians had to rethink their future.
The result was that the ``end'' of Scotland The What? became, in fact, just the
real beginning, destined to run for another 26 years, for part of that time in
tandem with their own careers. Buff was chief executive of Grampian Health
Board, Steve was an Aberdeen lawyer and George was deputy rector of Perth
Academy.
The rest is theatrical history, already matured into legend. On that farewell
night they looked too youthful to go. There will still be an occasional
appearance in the North-east but the touring days are finally over.
Proposing that farewell toast the other evening, I knew we were saying goodbye
to three men who had done more than anyone to stem the decline of that
North-east tongue which is sometimes called the Doric. It will be the poorer
for the parting.
Now, with honorary degrees from Aberdeen University already bestowed, Buff,
Steve and George will go to Buckingham Palace on December 12 to collect their
MBEs. That honour has never been more deserved.

WHAT Government would be best for business in Scotland? Not this one. A
first-class Scottish industry is being destroyed right now by the impotence,
compounded by the indifference, of the Scottish Office.
Fergus Ewing wrote to you (November 17) that once again, as in 1989 and in
1993, the market for farmed salmon is flooded with Norwegian production. He
said the Norwegians have 50,000 tons for which there is no market.
Only three weeks later I hear from Norway that the new estimate of surplus
production is over 100,000 tons.
For four years the Scottish Office has refused pleas from Scottish farmers to
establish producer organisations to control the number of smolts put to sea in
Norway, Scotland, Ireland, and the Faroes, according to the EU Common Fisheries
Policy. All the other countries want such producer organisations.
Now that in the absence of such a scheme the market has collapsed yet again you
might suppose that embarrassed Scottish Office Ministers would rush in to help.
Some hope. Just as in 1993 it is the Irish (whose industry is one-fifth the
size of the Scottish) who are fighting for emergency measures in Brussels. Just
as in 1993 the British Government is sitting on its hands.
Why? One reason is Scottish Office impotence, because all relations with the EU
on such matters are handled by London through the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries.
MAFF in turn has to do what it is told by the Treasury, which of course has
much more important things to worry about than the collapse of salmon farms 500
miles from London.
The second reason is Scottish Office indifference. There isn't the slightest
chance of the Tories winning a seat at the next election anywhere near a salmon
farm.
Business needs a Government in Scotland - a real Government of course: a
devolved assembly as proposed would have no more clout in Brussels or with the
Norwegians than does Mr Forsyth.

A SCHEME to help childless couples, set up 10 years ago by a private hospital
in Glasgow in association with Glasgow University and an NHS hospital, is under
investigation after allegations of financial irregularities.
The Herald understands that the inquiry is not linked to the infertility
scheme's acquisition of donors but concerns working practices and contracts.
Professor Ian Greer, head of the university's Obstetrics and Gynaecology
Department, is leading the investigation, which has been under way for several
months.
It is understood to be linked to the assisted conception service provided by
the university in association with Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Glasgow
Nuffield private hospital.
The service was established by the Nuffield in 1985 to treat infertile couples
with the help of cash donations made to the university.
Patients who come for IVF (in vitro fertilisation) treatment in Glasgow with
their own donor are referred to the Nuffield - which collaborates with GRI and
Glasgow University in the city's IVF programme - to have it done privately.
To have it done on the NHS entails waiting in the queue for an anonymous donor
to become available.
The Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department under investigation has a staff of 15
academics and several other lower-grade members. A separate Department of
Obstetrics and Gynaecology within the university is linked with the Western
Infirmary.
A university spokesman declined to discuss details of the inquiry yesterday. He
said no-one had been suspended at this stage. He was not aware of any
suggestion that the police might become involved.
A spokesman for the GRI said he believed the investigation was ``purely an
internal university matter'' and had no bearing on services carried out by the
hospital. A spokeswoman for the Nuffield said she was confident there were no
irregularities involving the hospital.

NEWSVIEW: The new M8 extension spells good news for badgers, but what about
motorists?
THE long-awaited M8 extension on the west side of Edinburgh, designed to end
the traffic chaos and tailbacks          at the notorious Newbridge roundabout,
officially opens in seven days' time.
It is hoped that the new link will improve things for drivers coming from the
west of Scotland, who will be able to bypass the roundabout on their way to the
capital.
Already the extension is being hailed as a major boost to motorists, and, would
you believe, badgers. A special ``animal motorway'' has been created under part
of the road to make it easier for the badgers, who live in woods on either
side, to cross.
Fencing on both sides of the motorway will lead the badgers down to a tunnel,
which will take them safely to the other side.
However, the growing number of critics of the new road plan believe it will
only be the badgers who will be able to travel up and down the motorway more
quickly than they used to.
They believe drivers coming from the west will still be stuck in traffic jams,
albeit not at the Newbridge roundabout but at a different place on the new road.
Leading critics of the #40m road plan, who include a senior lecturer in
transport economy and a major east coast amenity group, believe the extension
will make no difference to the massive traffic problems on the west side of
Edinburgh.
Even the AA and the RAC do not seem convinced that the new road will completely
end the traffic chaos.
The new Claylands to Edinburgh city bypass road starts at the west end at the
spur off the existing M8 at Claylands Farm just before the Newbridge roundabout
and will connect the M8 direct to the Edinburgh city bypass at Hermiston. It is
designed to cut traffic coming both to and from Edinburgh on the west side of
the city.
The road is designed to provide relief to both the Newbridge roundabout and to
help traffic flow on connecting roads to the M9 and the A8.
Critics question just how successful the new road extension will be, and do not
accept Scottish Office claims that it will bring to an end the massive
tailbacks on the roads coming into Edinburgh.
At present, the congested A8 from Newbridge to the Gogar roundabout past
Edinburgh Airport carries an average of 58,000 vehicles a day.
The Scottish Office said that the new M8 extension will allow traffic to bypass
that area and the amount of traffic using that road will drop by nearly half to
29,000 vehicles a day.
Despite the supposed benefits of the extension road, experts and
environmentalists still have major concerns.
``The Scottish Office is simply buying time by opening the M8 extension,'' said
David Begg, lecturer in transport economy at Napier University.
``Give it two years and the tailbacks of traffic from the west trying to get
into Edinburgh will be back to the same levels. They are simply moving the
traffic problem from the Newbridge roundabout to the city bypass.
``I do not think this new road will make any great difference in journey times
between Edinburgh and Glasgow city centre.
``Although we fully accept there will be a cut in traffic on the way into
Edinburgh initially, the road traffic problem will slowly build up and will
just be shifted further along to where the new M8 extension meets the Edinburgh
city bypass, causing just as long tailbacks,'' said Mr Begg, who is also
chairman of Lothian Regional Council's transportation committee.
Supporters of the road extension disagree and say it will bring to an end the
years of frustration felt by the millions of people who have endured the
traffic jams in and around the dreaded Newbridge roundabout.
As well as the new extension connecting the M8 straight to the Edinburgh city
bypass, there will be roads off the new motorway to help break up the traffic
log-jams. It is estimated that 33,000 vehicles will use the extension alone
each day.
Despite the optimism, Mr Begg said there are still fundamental problems with
the road plan.
``The Scottish Office are driving people from Glasgow city boundary to the
Edinburgh city boundary. Once they get there, the problems begin.
``In Edinburgh the problems of getting into the city centre will be huge. When
drivers from the west hit the city bypass they will have the option of either
turning left - back towards the Gogar roundabout at the Gyle, going through the
bottle-neck that is Corstorphine High Street or turning right on the city
by-pass and going into town through Sighthill.''
One point even critics accept is that the big construction contract to build
the road has been handled efficiently and well.
Scottish Office chiefs are said to be delighted that contractors Balfour
Beattie managed to get the road extension ready for opening ten weeks early and
built with no overuns and within budget.
Around 200 men worked on the 92-week contract, moving two million cubic metres
of soil and clay. The work included building four new bridges, three extensions
to existing bridges and five new main carriageways. Four thousand tonnes of
concrete was used in the construction.
During the work a newt colony was found at Goldenacre pond, near the motorway,
and a conservation area set up for them. A 3500-year-old bronze age burial site
near Ratho was found, which was excavated and documented before construction
work began.
The road may have been built on time, but the extension itself has certainly
been a long-time coming. It was first discussed in the early 1960s, due to
complaints by motorists who were even then unhappy at road delays.
It took until 1985 for the first extension plan to be drawn up, and only in
February 1992, after a public inquiry, was the project given the go-ahead. In
the interim, traffic signals were installed at Newbridge in an attempt to
spread the travel problems out and to make journey times more predictable.
Mr Terry Levinthal, secretary of the Cockburn Association, an amenity and
environmental group, said there was currently a tremendous sea change of
opinion against road building in Scotland.
He said: ``If this road was at the planning stage now, there would be
tremendous opposition to it. People are realising building more roads is not
the answer to cutting congestion.
``I am more and more concerned there will be no decrease in traffic on the M8.
It will just push more and more cars on to the city bypass, and very soon the
bypass will be so congested that it will be full of traffic jams and will
become one big parking lot.''
Mr Levinthal accused the Scottish Office of keeping the public in the dark over
how effective the road will be in cutting traffic.
``What the Scottish Office is not telling us is just how much new road
extensions like this one cut traffic,'' said Mr Levinthal.
``The old M8 may well be ten times busier in a few years' time if the extension
had not been built. However, the question to be asked is whether it is worth
building a new #40m road if you just manage to cut that figure marginally. The
more roads you build, the more cars come along to use them.
``The Secretary of State has put his plans for a second Forth Road Bridge on
ice, so no traffic would be going to that from the M8.
``Because of that and other factors the extension is just yet another road
being built which is not part of an overall road strategy.''
Motoring groups also have their concerns over the road's possible long-term
effectiveness in cutting traffic.
Sue Nicholson, of the RAC, said: ``The extension will make a difference to the
horrific traffic problems to the west of Edinburgh.
``However, we believe the extension is not the complete answer and feel it
should be linked up to other measures which we believe the new Edinburgh City
Council want to look at, like park and ride projects and an improvement in
public transport.''
Neil Gregg, the AA's environmental officer in Scotland, said he was pleased
that the new extension would split traffic up coming towards Edinburgh and make
it easier to get to the city bypass. However, he said there was a worry that
the Gogar roundabout rather than the Newbridge roundabout would become the
focus for traffic difficulties.
Despite the criticism of the new road, the Scottish Office is still adamant
that the new extension, which will be opened by Scottish Office minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton next Monday, will be a great boost for drivers.
Only time will tell if its prediction of less traffic congestion and quicker
journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh will come true, or whether it is
only the badgers who will have cause for celebration over the new road.

Jodie Foster in
Net death threat
LOS ANGELES: Actress Jodie Foster has been targeted with death threats and
other explicit messages on the Internet, Hollywood trade newspaper Daily
Variety reports today. The FBI has been asked to investigate threats against
the Oscar-winning star after the messages detailed explicit plans for attacking
and murdering her and also described imaginary sexual encounters.
In March 1981, crazed fan John Hinckley tried to impress Foster by carrying out
an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.
Rutskoi to run
MOSCOW: Alexander Rutskoi, leader of the bloody 1993 revolt against President
Boris Yeltsin, has announced that he will run for president of Russia next
year. Former vice-president Rutskoi, 48, tried to overthrow Yeltsin in a coup
bid brutally crushed when the president sent in tanks. Rutskoi was jailed but
later freed under an amnesty. Yeltsin, still recovering from a heart attack,
has not yet said if he will run again.
Twins apart
TEL AVIV: Israeli doctors successfully separated Siamese twins yesterday, hours
after the girls were born joined at the intestine. ``They are in excellent
condition,'' said a spokesman. It was only the sixth such recorded case as most
Siamese twins are joined at the chest.
Anglers on ice
MOSCOW: Helicopters and icebreakers were searching yesterday for six Russian
anglers who have been adrift on an icefloe for four days. They were reported
missing by two other fishermen who made it back to land after the ice broke
away into the large inland sea of Lake Onega, 570 miles north of Moscow.
Poll ban urged
CAIRO: Opposition parties in Egypt, angry because they did not win any seats in
the first round of parliamentary elections, are considering a boycott of
Wednesday's second round to decide the remaining 70% of the seats.
King `resting'
DUBAI: Saudi Arabia's royal court said yesterday that King Fahd had been
advised to rest, but that his health was no cause for alarm. Concern over the
73-year-old monarch arose when the court said he had been admitted to hospital
for checks.
Cashing in
LILLE: Bruno Calonne, a 36-year-old bank cashier, says    he will go to work
today just like any other day, although he has just won a record    F69m

<HEADLINE>Thursday spells triumph or disaster for Galileo Jupiter probe's moment of truth</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975061024</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SIX-YEAR journey to one of the strangest places in the solar system ends this
week in a 75-minute suicide flight to the heart of the planet Jupiter.
Astronomers and scientists around the world are waiting with bated breath the
arrival of the unmanned Galileo spacecraft at the massive planet after a 300
million-mile journey dogged by problems.
Among them is a British professor who hopes the #1000m mission will feed back
benefits for the humble weather forecast on earth.
On Thursday, a probe launched from the craft in July is due to become the first
man-made object to plunge into the turbulent atmosphere of Jupiter.
As it plummets towards certain destruction in conditions of intense heat and
pressure, its mother ship will take up orbit around Jupiter, ready to transmit
masses of information about the little-understood fifth planet.
Galileo mission director Dr Neil Ausman describes Thursday as the ``day of
truth'', when Nasa will know whether its investment in the 20-year project has
paid dividends.
He said: ``If it doesn't work, it will be devastating. If it does, we will be
walking around six feet off the ground.''
Atmospheric physicist Professor Fred Taylor, of Oxford University, is the head
of the only British scientific team to have equipment on board Galileo.
He said: ``This is a very exciting time for us. I have been working on this
project since 1976, so it has been a very long wait.
``There is a lot about Jupiter that we do not understand, and Galileo will
provide us with the first hard physical data so we can start pinning down
exactly how the planet's atmospheric systems work.''
Among the mysteries which Professor Taylor hopes to solve are the causes of
Jupiter's distinctive giant red spot and the bands of colour on the surface of
its atmosphere.
He hopes to discover whether Jupiter's incredible winds - known to reach speeds
of more than 300mph - are matched by equally terrifying storms and lightning.
He believes that the remarkable Jovian weather he learns about from Galileo
will improve our understanding of weather on earth.
``Jupiter has a very strange atmosphere by Earth terms, but we are interested
in comparisons with Earth. The interesting thing about Jupiter is that it is so
much larger than Earth, so it may have similar weather patterns but on a much
bigger scale, with some weather systems as big as the earth itself,'' said the
professor.
``New knowledge like this always translates into practical applications
eventually, but we don't know what we are going to find out, so it's difficult
to predict how.
``But we would expect the effect of our new information to diffuse out
gradually to places like the Met Office and the weather forecasts.''
Professor Taylor's experiments have been hit by the failure of Galileo's main
communications antenna to function, which has impaired the spacecraft's ability
to transmit its discoveries to earth.
He said: ``We will only get about a tenth of the data we were expecting, but
that is not as bad as it sounds, as there will still be an enormous amount to
work with, so we are not too despondent.''
The probe will enter Jupiter's atmosphere at 110,000mph, but will be slowed to
1000mph within minutes by the dense gases. The friction of entry will raise the
temperature on its surface to 28,000C, more than twice the heat of the sun.
It will have an estimated 75 minutes to send information back to Galileo for
transmission to earth before being destroyed by Jupiter's hostile atmosphere.
Professor Taylor said: ``It is a toss-up whether it gets crushed or baked
first. We expect it to survive up to about 20 times the atmospheric pressure of
earth, but by that time the heat might have destroyed it.''
As the probe is vaporized, the Galileo mother ship will settle into an orbit
round Jupiter, recording data from a distance for around two years.
Galileo's arrival will be a triumph over massive adversity by the Nasa team at
Pasadena, California.
The craft was to have taken just 30 months to reach Jupiter after launching on
one of the earliest Space Shuttle flights in 1982.
Delays in the Shuttle programme put the launch back to 1986, when the
Challenger disaster sent the whole project back to the drawing board.
Galileo was redesigned with a smaller motor, and eventually launched in 1989 on
a spiral route, orbiting the sun twice and using the planets' gravitational
forces to power its flight.
After two decades of intense effort and technological achievement against the
odds, for the scientists at Nasa, Thursday will be one of the most nail-biting
white-knuckle rides of all time.

HOUSING is the number one issue MPs face from their constituents, but it is not
given the political attention it deserves, it was claimed yesterday.
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations will today try to alter that
situation.
The federation, representing the country's 200 housing associations and
co-operatives which manage nearly 80,000 homes, will launch a major campaign
aimed at getting housing on to the political agenda alongside ``popular''
issues such as health, education and crime.
As part of it, politicians and prospective candidates in the next General
Election are to be given a non-party political housing manifesto.
Mr David Orr, federation director, said political debate tended to centre on
issues such as health and education.
``Housing is every bit as important,'' he said. ``After all, poor housing
affects children's education and people's health generally.
``We will be campaigning hard with all the political parties to get them to
take housing matters seriously.''
The manifesto drawn up by the federation calls for the housing association
budget to be doubled to allow a minimum of 10,000 new homes a year.
It maintains housing and social work departments, health boards and the private
sector will need to continue to offer housing associations free land to tackle
homelessness.
The manifesto also says a capital subsidy system is needed to ensure affordable
rented housing is available to those who need it.

JIMMY JEWEL, the comic with the unmistakeable battered look of a downtrodden
bloodhound, died yesterday on the eve of his 83rd birthday.
He was one of a small group of music hall artists who made the successful
transition to straight acting late in life. He was half of a legendary double
act with his cousin Ben Warriss, a kind of British Abbott and Costello. They
achieved nationwide celebrity status on stage and radio.
Then, approaching the age of 60, he gravitated towards acting and received wide
acclaim for his performances in West End plays such as The Comedians and Death
of a Salesman.
Jewel was hailed as one of the best character actors in the business and worked
through his 70s in the theatre and on television, saying he would only stop
when he became an embarrassment to himself or other people.
He saw no barrier between comedy and acting, and pointed to the success of
American vaudeville stars like James Cagney and Red Buttons who moved to the
screen.
But for TV viewers he will be best remembered as the lecherous, boozy character
partnering Hylda Baker in the long-running 1970s TV series Nearest and Dearest.
It ran for 65 episodes and was a huge audience-puller.
Yet, unknown to fans, it was a disaster off the set, with Baker even trying to
have Jewel, her ``Dearest'' partner, replaced by another actor.
Like Max Wall, in whose footsteps he followed from comedy to acting, he had the
advantage of having been born and reared in showbusiness.
Born James Arthur Thomas Jewel Marsh in Sheffield on December 4, 1912, he had
three distinct careers in his lifetime - first as part of the family troupe,
second with Ben Warriss in the double act and finally as a distinguished actor.
It is no exaggeration to say he came up the hard way with more than his fair
share of broken limbs, black eyes and other assorted injuries acquired through
the physical side of showbusiness.
He claimed that he never wanted to be a performer. His great joy was stage
managing his father and the hard physical labour involved in loading sets on to
horse drays and into railway trucks as the family toured the music halls.
But at the age of 14 he did a sketch called The Tripe Supper and enjoyed the
audience's laughter so much that he set out on his career as a comic.
Shortly before his father died, he teamed up in 1934 with Warriss, who had been
born in the same Sheffield bed just months earlier. Their mothers were sisters.
The partnership came about through chance - at the time Jimmy told stories
ending with an impersonation of Maurice Chevalier, while Ben sang Eddie Cantor
songs and was a successful ``top-hat-and-tails'' performer.
They found themselves on the same bill in Newcastle upon Tyne and when one of
the turns - a double act - failed to appear, they decided to go on as second
act and ``see what kind of a go we could make of it'', as Jimmy later said.
The Jewel and Warriss team was born and stayed together for 32 years.
They topped the bill at The Palladium, had six Royal Command performances and
during the 1950s were able to make #2500 a week. They were the Morecambe and
Wise of their generation.
But this showbusiness marriage was dissolved in 1966 when the two comics
decided to go their separate ways as the music halls disappeared.
Jimmy Jewel's career went into the doldrums and he genuinely believed his life
on the stage was over.
But around 1970, Frank Muir, then head of comedy at the BBC, asked him to do a
Variety Playhouse script called Spanner in the Works. It was the turning point.
Overnight, the ageing comic became an actor.

MILLIONS of contact lens wearers could be at risk from a rare eye disease
because they use inadequate cleaning solutions, says a report.
More and more people are suffering from an ailment caused by a microscopic
organism which eats away at the eye, according to BBC1's consumer programme,
Watchdog, tonight. Eye experts believe that problems may arise because two out
of three lens-cleaning solutions are not powerful enough.
An eye surgeon told the programme that the number of people suffering from the
disease - acanthamoeba keratitis - had quadrupled since 1990 and he was now
seeing about 40 sufferers a year.
Staff at the Moorfields eye hospital in London told the programme that only one
third of cleansing solutions contained hydrogen peroxide, the chemical most
effective in killing the organism. ``We're seeing a dramatic increase,'' said
John Dart, consultant opthalmologist at Moorfields.
``It is a very unpleasant condition. The disease lasts for many months, if not
years. About one in 10 patients lose their sight.''
``I'm concerned that most of the solutions are neither effective against
acanthamoeba or against bacteria.''

<TEXT>
HOTEL giant Forte, which is under #3400m bid siege by Granada, has sold its
Lillywhites sports chain for #28.5m.
Granada, whose interests span broadcasting to motorway service stations,
announced when it launched its hostile offer last month that it would sell
Lillywhites if the bid succeeded.
Lillywhites, with its flagship store in central London, recently opened a
second branch in the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex. It also has
outlets in St Andrews and Gatwick.
The sale to Jeronimo Martins, a Portuguese retailing group, is likely to form a
key part of Forte's defence strategy. The group, which is due to post its
defence document to shareholders over the next few days, is thought likely to
highlight the Lillywhites sale as demonstrating its ability to unlock hidden
value from its businesses. The price raised by the sale is more than twice the
#12m value in the group's accounts.

Paul Welsh considers moves to provide nursery education for Gaelic-speakers
FËILTE Chlànn, a Gaelic welcome to children, could be heard with increasingly
regularity in Glasgow if a campaign just launched is ultimately successful.
Parent power is being mobilised in the city to establish two Gaelic-speaking
nursery schools for four to five-year-olds by next August.
``This is the vital link missing in Gaelic education for children in Glasgow,''
says campaign spokesperson, Katherine Gillies, treasurer of Croileagan Partick,
a Gaelic playgroup in the city's West End.
``We want to give Gaelic-speaking children the same opportunities that English
speakers already have,'' she continues, ``but as things stand we are losing a
lot of children because of the lack of a suitable nursery. Glasgow's Gaelic
language base is definitely being negatively affected by this.''
Although Strathclyde contains a substantial number of Pàrant in Paisde (parent
and toddler) playgroups and three Bùnsgoil (Gaelic medium primary schools),
there are no Sgoil Aràich, or pre-school nurseries, for four to five-year-olds
in the region. After playgroup, working parents have no option but to place
children in English-speaking nurseries, and often feel they cannot take the
children away from their friends when it is time to enrol in primary school.
The campaign organisers believe a bridge for this age-group is essential, if
this damaging trend is to be curbed.
``The demand for the nurseries is mushrooming,'' says Gillies. ``The emphasis
would be on education rather than play, helping the children to develop a
pre-school foundation in letter and number recognition.''
At present, the campaign is ``more of a feasibility study'', as the organisers
compile a register of names and contact numbers for children recently born to
five years of age who may use the nursery, and prefered locations for the new
full-time resource. ``We want to show there is demand for the nursery, not just
this year, but for the next five years to come,'' explains Gillies.
A recent census by the Gaelic Council suggests there is a 7000-strong
Gaelic-speaking community within a two-mile radius of Partick Burgh Halls and,
according to Gillies, there is ``a general consensus'' that one nursery should
be established close-by in the West End, serving the north side of Glasgow.
Steering communities on both sides of the river will ultimately determine the
best location for each nursery, however, and much of the impetus in the early
stages of the campaign is coming from non Gaelic-speaking and English nationals.
``In the sixties, speaking two languages was thought of as a hindrance to your
education,'' says Gillies. ``Many parents who want their children to learn
Gaelic now, come from Gaelic backgrounds but lost the language during that
period. Some of them are very annoyed about it now, but west coasters are
really pretty reticent by nature. The English will get up there and shout,
whereas Scots are definitely more modest.''
After compiling the register, the second stage of the campaign is an
application to Glasgow City Authority, the new unitary body which replaces the
Glasgow District Council and Strathclyde region on April 1 next year. The
organisers want both nurseries to be local authority run, rather than private
concerns, and are also aware of specific EU grants available to help sustain
lesser-spoken languages.
Since the early eighties, Strathclyde region has given a strong commitment to
the language, and Gillies thinks this will continue. The new campaign is
reminiscent of the push for Gaelic primary education in the city which resulted
in the establishment of the Sir John Maxwell School in 1984, the only Gaelic
primary that falls within the boundary of the new authority. Councillor Malcolm
Green, GCA Education Convener in waiting, is positive about the campaign.
``This is a campaign to maximise interest among parents, rather than against
the council,'' Green says. ``A nursery for four to five-year-olds fits
logically with the provision we are already making for Gaelic education, but it
is up to the parents themselves to determine numbers and suitable locations.''
``In principle,'' he continues, ``there is no minimum number for a successful
application, but I would expect somewhere between 12 and 20 children would
secure the nurseries. We would try to minimise start-up costs by freeing space
in existing primary schools, for instance, and also help minimise the distance
children would have to travel.''
If the voucher scheme proposed by the Government, guaranteeing #1100 worth of
nursery education for four-year-olds, is eventually implemented, Green would
like the new city authority to collect any vouchers spent on Gaelic nursery
education in Glasgow.
A public meeting this evening at Glasgow Caledonian University, run by
Comhairle Nan Sgoiltean Araich (CNSA), the Gaelic Pre-School Council, will
focus on Gaelic nursery provision in the city.

AT first glance, James Tolmie's letter (November 29) paints a distressing
scenario of hard-pressed staff from the procurator-fiscal's office finding
themselves even more overworked, busily scrutinising video tapes of football
matches, searching carefully for heinous misdemeanours perpetrated during play.
But fear not! Those canny lads at the fiscal's office have already found a way
to lighten their load. By restricting themselves to watching only one of the
potential 20 matches played, and then by focusing on only one set of players,
their onerous burden is much reduced.

THE Government was yesterday urged to set up an independent, high-powered
commission to examine the impact of the National Lottery on charity work
overseas.
Mr George Foulkes, Shadow Overseas Aid Minister, claimed that the Lottery could
be depriving Third World countries of badly-needed donations.
``We are already facing a 7.5% cut in the overseas aid budget. On top of that,
the social effects of the Lottery are having a much greater impact than
forecast both at home and overseas.''
He said the reduced amounts people are now giving to charity because of the
Lottery were hitting those organisations doing vital work in the poorest and
most deprived regions of the world.
``The impact of this, plus the cutbacks in official aid, could be having a
calamitous effect on those already in dire straits in these countries.
``It is time, a year and a bit on from the inception of the National Lottery,
that its impact and its effects right across the globe should be reviewed in a
very dispassionate and penetrating way.''
Mr Foulkes said he would be asking National Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley to order such an inquiry ``as a matter of the utmost urgency''.

<RECORDNO>975061032</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NORTH-SOUTH divide has opened up among Britain's redundant executives, a
survey out today suggests.
Freshly-redundant high fliers in the northern half of Britain get more support
from their wives and are more likely to talk to them openly about their plight.
They are also more likely to have working wives - and more likely to find that
their problems bring them closer together.
Southerners are more likely to react to redundancy by cutting household
expenses - and their partners are more willing to consider moving abroad to a
new job.
But throughout Britain the stigma that once attached to redundancy has
vanished, financial strains have eased with the growing number of two-income
households - and families are becoming more willing to look further afield for
work.
The most common reflection from the newly-redundant executive is: ``I wish I
had spent more time with my family.''
And wives are far more willing to move to help their redundant husband find a
job than the husbands of redundant women executives.
The survey, published today by career consultants Drake Beam Morrin, is based
on responses from 171 executives, most of them men.
The firm attributed the North-South divide to the industrial heritage of the
North - and the shock waves that job losses sent through the white-collar South.
``I think the North has had more of a history of job losses over the years, and
it is something that most households will have experience of,'' said managing
director Peter Trigg.
``But in the South the professional classes were really hard hit in the
recession, while, for generations before, they had not been people who lost
their jobs. This could explain the different attitudes.''
The typical executive in the survey was in his late 40s or early 50s, married
with children, and earning between #30,000 and #45,000 before losing his job.
Just over a third - 34% - had a non-working partner, well down on the 42% in a
previous survey in 1994, and in the previous month most of them - 85% - had no
financial difficulties.
Nearly 30% believed they could spend up to a year searching for a job before
hitting financial problems, while nearly a quarter could afford to job-hunt for
up to two years.
But 13% reckoned they had only six months to find a job before encountering
serious financial problems.
Ninety-seven per cent of couples in the North had ``openly'' discussed their
plight together compared with 89% in the South.
Northern husbands or wives were more likely actively to help redundant partners
find work, and the overall proportion of partners prepared to do this was well
up on last year.
The main concern of all the executives was the fear of long-term unemployment,
while partners were more worried about their inability to plan for the future.
Forty-five per cent of all couples thought redundancy had drawn them together -
but less so in the South than in the North.
If finding a job meant a move overseas, 41% of southern wives would be prepared
to follow their husbands - but only 21% of northern wives.
But overall, three-quarters of all partners were willing to move elsewhere
within the UK - compared with just 51% in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Profiting from milk quality</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<FLAG>COLLEGE COMMENT</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975061033</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MILK quality now attracts substantial premiums for those producers able to sell
milk with a high butterfat and, more importantly, a high protein level. The
converse is also true - milk of low-quality now attracts penalties which can
make a considerable difference to a farmer's income from milk sales.
The various milk buyers operate different payment systems for quality. It is
important to study these pricing arrangements to see the effect they will have
on income.
Penalty deductions will become more evident in many situations. The instinctive
reaction to receiving deductions in a milk cheque is to try to improve milk
quality, but this may not be the most profitable option.
Although premiums are paid for high butterfat, it is not always desirable to
increase butterfat. This is because of the effect it can have on the milk quota
situation if the butterfat trigger operates.
Increasing butterfat will result in production being adjusted upwards without
any compensatory payment. It may actually pay a farmer to reduce butterfat
despite being penalised for poorer quality.
More emphasis is being placed on protein in an effort to encourage higher
levels in milk. Dietary changes are the only way to effect an immediate
improvement in protein levels. This means ensuring that the type and level of
protein in the diet are adequate.
This has to be coupled with sufficient energy of the right type in the ration
to encourage the correct fermentation in the rumen. In the longer term,
improvements in protein percentage can be made through breeding and attention
to the overall herd management.
With dietary manipulation to improve milk quality, the over-riding factor has
to be - does it pay and produce a ration capable of maintaining cow health and
fertility?
More than ever, milk costing is an important tool in monitoring the overall
profit levels from the herd.

Valletta
NO TRACE has been found of a small aircraft which went missing over the
Mediterranean this morning with six people including one Briton on board.
The hunt was launched shortly after 5am when the single-engine Piper aircraft
operated by Excelair Services Ltd failed to arrive in Malta on a two-hour
flight from the island of Jerba, off Tunisia.
Maltese police named the missing Briton as Michael Williams. It is not known
which part of the UK he is from.
Jets from the Maltese air force, two Excelair planes, and helicopters from an
Italian base on the island scoured the sea south-west of Malta for almost 12
hours but found no sign of the aircraft. The search was called off at nightfall.
Spokesmen for the Maltese Police and Directorate of Civil Aviation said there
were no clues to what had happened to the plane which was reported missing
after it failed to make contact with the Maltese control tower.
No distress signal was received from the aircraft, which left Tunisia before
dawn and was due to take two hours to reach Malta.
The police spokesman said the hunt would resume tomorrow.
The other passengers are Irishman Desmond Goomer, Gorny Tadeuse from Poland,
and Phillip Farrugia and Matthew Aquilinia, both from Malta.
The plane was piloted by Maltese Carmel Bartolo, a director of Sun Aviation Ltd
which owns the aircraft.
A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that Mr Williams was missing and said that
UK missions in Malta and Tunisia were investigating his disappearance.

POLICE investigating the murder of Rachel Nickell have arrested a 31-year-old
man.
Scotland Yard said that he had been arrested at a south London police station
after voluntarily surrendering himself on November 22.
They would not confirm he is John Gallagher, a former barman, who had returned
from New Zealand.
A spokesman said: ``We can confirm that a 31-year-old man attended voluntarily
at a police station on November 22 with his solicitor. He was formally arrested
in connection with the death of Rachel Nickell and bailed while further
inquiries continue.''
Gallagher, originally from Roehampton estate, near Wimbledon Common, south
London, where Rachel was killed, had emigrated to New Zealand where he shared a
home with his girlfriend in Hastings, on the North Island.
Scotland Yard officers flew out to interview him after a new witness came
forward in the case.
Rachel, a 23-year-old former model, was stabbed 49 times as she walked on
Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son Alex in July 1992.
In 1993, Colin Stagg, also from the Roehampton estate, was charged with her
murder. Police had set up a major operation to lure Stagg into confessing, but
he was acquitted after the trial judge at the Old Bailey last year attacked the
police tactics.

Paris
FRENCH Defence Minister Charles Millon said tonight he had ordered the
commander of UN forces in Sarajevo to return to Paris after he criticised the
Bosnia peace accord, saying France should have rejected it.
Millon said in a television interview: ``I have asked General (Jean-Rene)
Bachelet to return to Paris. I will be meeting him tomorrow. It is quite
obvious the French Government cannot accept any sort of criticism of the Dayton
plan.''
He did not make clear whether Bachelet would be replaced, or whether he would
be allowed to complete his tour of duty in Sarajevo, which has six months to
run.
Bachelet apologised yesterday for remarks published in the French press which
he said had not been not intended for publication.
He was quoted on Friday as saying the accord would drive panicky Bosnian Serbs
to flee the Bosnian capital, burning their homes as they left.
He said US negotiator Richard Holbrooke had cynically pushed through a hasty
peace accord in Dayton, Ohio, to promote President Bill Clinton's re-election
campaign.
Millon said France had clearly accepted the Dayton plan, due to be signed in
Paris on December 14, and would be sending 7500 men on the ground to help
enforce it.
However he said the French Government was concerned that ``the balance between
the communities should be respected''.
President Jacques Chirac wrote to President Clinton last week calling for
guarantees for the Bosnian Serbs, who fear they will be overrun in Sarajevo
once their militia is disarmed and disbanded in the Bosnian capital within 45
days of signing the peace deal.
Bachelet said the accord would lead to more ``ethnic cleansing'' and drive
Serbs to flee Sarajevo by the thousands, burning their homes as they left.
``We would then see terrible television pictures of French soldiers directing
traffic while houses burned,'' he said. ``If the operation fails, we, the
French, will be held responsible.''
The Defence Ministry disowned Bachelet's remarks on Friday night but senior
defence officials made clear there were serious differences with Washington
about the implementation of the Bosnian peace accord.
Beyond the issue of the Sarajevo Serbs, France is also concerned at the US
intention to rearm the Muslim-led Bosnian government army, and at Washington's
insistence on withdrawing a Nato-commanded international peace force after one
year, fearing it could lead to a new outbreak of bloodshed.
Bachelet criticised his own government for accepting last month's peace
agreement, saying: ``General de Gaulle would without doubt have slammed the
door in Dayton''.
Bachelet's barb about De Gaulle was an implicit rebuke to President Jacques
Chirac, who considers himself the political heir of the late general and
president of France.
On a related issue, Millon said Chirac had warned Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic of the consequences if two French pilots shot down by the Bosnian
Serbs were not released in the next few days.
He said France would otherwise ``take measures which the Serbs would have cause
to regret''. He did not spell them out but said the Serbs knew they needed the
co-operation of the international community to implement the Bosnia peace
accord.-Reuter.

IN MY letter published on December 1, under the heading Irish pogroms only in
North, a phrase has been omitted from the tenth paragraph which leaves the
paragraph meaningless when taken with the folllowing paragraph.
The paragraphs contrast the situation in the 26 Counties as compared to the six
Counties. In the first of these paragraphs I originally wrote: ``Proportional
representation was included in the 1922 Constitution to protect the rights of
the small Protestant population of the 26 Counties.''
As you can see this significantly alters the sense of the two paragraphs.
In addition, where I refer to the decline in the relative Protestant population
in the South, my original text suggests it might be worth looking at the
long-term effects of the First World War on the Anglo-Irish population. I do
not, as in the published form, offer it as a hard and fast explanation, or as a
sole explanation.

A QUITE heavy reporting week kicks off this morning with Scottish &amp; Newcastle's
half-timer, with arch rival Bass reporting its full year fortunes on Wednesday.
S&amp;N's main point of interest will be progress on the Courage acquisition, which
turned it into Britain's biggest brewer and how much the restructuring will
cost.
Playing a big part in the profits increase during the six months to November 1
will be the hot summer and a good contribution from the Center Parcs holiday
operations. The concensus profits expectation is #162m compared with last
time's #145m.
Strong performances from hotels and pubs should have offset poorer trading from
Bass's bingo operations. The National Lottery will have hit its bingo, perhaps
by as much as 15% in the second half. For the full year to the end of Septmber,
pre-tax profits should have risen from #555m to about #590m, while the dividend
could improve by 1.4p to 22.5p.
Tomorrow sees electronics and engineering group Siebe with its interim. Broker
UBS suggests it will have made a pre-tax profit of #147m compared with #119m.
Shareholders are likely to see their interim dividend rise from 4.03p to 4.45p.
Control systems are thought to have been the main driving force behind the
group's improved fortunes.
Wednesday is graced by Robert Wiseman's Dairies, which has 5% of the overall UK
milk market. Progress reports on the rapid expansion through acquisition are
probably more important than the bare figures which should see the pre-tax
profit rise from #2.9m to about #4m.
Carlton Communications should have benefited from good advertising growth and
also from its video activities sufficiently to have pushed profits for the year
to September ahead from #190m to #250m, with the dividend being hoisted from
20.7p to 23.5p.
Engineering giant GEC is expected to show six month profits ahead by about 9%
to #413m on Thursday, but the dividend by just 5% to 3.1p. Attention will focus
on the problems at Marconi, the integration of VSEL and further news about the
re-shaping of the board.
Great Universal Stores' interim is thought likely to show little change apart
from a marginal improvement from #225m to perhaps #230m.
An uplift from #23.5m to anything between #28.5m and #36m is expected from
Racal.
Pubs group Greenalls will see analysts concentrate on news of its integration
of Boddingtons. They are looking for pre-tax profit for the year to September
rising from #74.8m to about #100m.

THEY thought they were just an ordinary couple with a baby, says Liz. That was
seven years ago, before they discovered that their infant son was one in a
million. When he was four weeks old, they discovered an unexplained lump in his
tummy and tests at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow had the
doctors baffled. After a couple of weeks in anxious consultation with genetic
specialists in London, Christopher tested positive for chronic granulomatous
disorder, CGD.
It is a genetic abnormality in which the white blood cells are unable to
produce the superoxide necessary for breaking down invading bacteria. As a
result, people with the condition are extremely susceptible to infections which
would be minor to other people and can quickly suffer serious complications
such as pneumonia, skin complaints which won't heal, bone infections, and
life-threatening abscesses on the heart, liver and lungs. Unfortunately
Christopher was severely affected by it and although given drug therapy, he
died at just six weeks old from an abscess on his liver.
His parents, devastated at his death, also had to cope with the completely
unexpected knowledge that they were carriers of a genetic disorder. Liz was
found to be a carrier of the type of CGD which is transmitted from mother to
son, although it does not affect her own health at all. Fewer than 100 people
in the UK have CGD, although one in 200,000 is a carrier.
It was first pinpointed in 1958 as an abnormality of the white cells which
means that when activated by bacteria they fail to produce a ``respiratory
burst'' which is important for making hydrogen peroxide which combines to make
a superoxide which is vital in killing bacteria.
We all depend on our genes for our very existence, but never give them a
moment's thought unless the secret code breaks down. Genes are succinctly
described by Dr Linda Lashford, a researcher into gene therapy for CGD in
Manchester, as ``the complement of instructions to guide normal growth and
function''. She regards the complex science of gene therapy as repairing that
list of instructions to enable the cell to function normally again.
Research into genetic disorders has moved ahead at such a fast pace in the past
few years that even from the time Christopher was diagnosed, there have been
enormous advances. Although by the nature of the deficiency, it must have
affected previous generations, it is likely that childhood illnesses and deaths
would have been attributed to other causes.
``In my great grandmother's generation infant deaths were much more common and
there is really no means of tracing the pattern of transmission in the
family,'' Liz said. As soon as the nature of the problem was diagnosed, other
family members who could be affected were tested. In her generation, from a
total of nine girl cousins, four are carriers including Liz and her sister.
Happily, Liz and Stephen now have two healthy little daughters, after what
their mother describes as two very long pregnancies during which they waited on
tenterhooks to find out whether they would have another affected son. It occurs
in one in two sons born to carriers and there is a one-in-two risk of daughters
being a carrier.
Only in the rarer cases of both parents being carriers (usually in marriages
within the extended family) are girls affected. The prospect of their daughters
having boys with CGD is something they may have to face in the future, but
Stephen is optimistic that by that time gene therapy will have advanced to the
point where the genetic damage can be corrected.
His hope is borne out by Professor Anthony Segal at University College, London,
the main centre for research into CGD in the UK. ``It is one of the disorders
which could be particularly amenable to gene therapy,'' said Professor Segal,
who predicts that successful treatment could be between five and 10 years away.
``CGD is the ideal case for treatment by gene therapy. It is a prototype
disease where the white blood cells can be aspirated from the bone marrow,
treated, cultured, and then tested to see if the defect has been corrected
before being put back into patients.''
Although patients have to be on long-term antibiotic treatment, it is not
necessarily fatal. The work in Professor Segal's laboratory, which has already
included some gene therapy trials, although none as yet has been successful, is
funded by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the small but
determined CGD Trust run by families of affected children, will also open the
way to gene therapy for other genetic disorders. ``We need support,'' added
Professor Segal.
Everyone from toddlers to grandparents can help raise funds for their work by
wearing jeans, preferably in unexpected places such as city offices, law
courts, schools, hospitals and on commuter trains and business class in
aeroplanes on March 1 next year. The CGD Trust has dubbed it Jeans for Genes
Day: a worldwide one-day sponsorship exercise to raise money for research into
gene replacement therapy for genetic disorders.
Proceeds from the UK appeal will be shared equally between four charities. They
are the Chronic Granulomatous Disorder Research Trust; the Primary
Immunodeficiency Association, whose 2000 members are deficient in certain
antibodies leaving them susceptible to specific infections, but in severe cases
suffer severe combined immune deficiency syndrome, dubbed Baby in the Bubble
syndrome from cases where children have had to be isolated in a sterile
environment; the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases, a distressing group
of rare metabolic diseases, whose sufferers lack an enzyme to break down used
materials in the body. Growth is usually restricted and they can cause
progressive mental as well as physical handicap and even death in childhood.
The fourth beneficiary will be the new gene therapy centre to be based at the
Institute of Child Health, the research arm of the Great Ormond Street
Children's Hospital in London, where the first gene therapy trial was carried
out in 1993.
n It is hoped that schools and businesses will support the Jeans for Genes Day
on March 1, 1996. More information from the appeal director, telephone 01725
517 977.
Losing a child is devastating enough for any couple, but the trauma is even
worse if it is revealed that they were responsible for the death.

n IN The Herald on October 27 we published an article headlined ``The Pill
scare'' in which we interviewed Dr Jane Davie, the Senior Clinical Medical
Officer with the Edinburgh Family Planning Services and Well Woman Clinic,
about the problems that had been caused after an official warning was issued
over use of the pill. In the context of that article we quoted Dr Davie as
stating that she accepted that the CSM had over-reacted and also that she felt
that the piecemeal information from the CSM had been very badly mismanaged. We
also made reference to ``time bombs'' and ``crises''. We have been asked by Dr
Davie to point out that she did not use these exact words in the interview and
also that the article did not correctly reflect her views on the safety of
second and third-generation pills. We have specifically been asked to mention
that Dr Davie did not make any direct criticism of the CSM in the course of the
interview. We are glad to set the record straight.

FEARS were expressed yesterday that the success of the BBC Scotland television
drama series Hamish Macbeth has led to a growth in unscrupulous dog dealers
using sub-standard stock to cash in on it.
The warning follows confirmation by the Scottish Kennel Club that dog breeders
have been receiving almost 100 inquiries daily about the availability of West
Highland white terrier puppies similar to the one given to PC Hamish Macbeth as
a present in the series.
Concern has been expressed that Westies and other popular breeds of dogs are
being churned out at puppy farms in certain areas of the country to meet
increasing public demand.
However, bodies such as the Scottish Kennel Club, the National Canine Defence
League, and the SSPCA, have a major task in identifying unscrupulous puppy
breeders and are looking to the Government to assist them.
The Scottish Kennel Club is opposed to the ``indiscriminate breeding'' on puppy
farms and says many of the puppies are bred from poor quality stock which is
not screened for hereditary diseases.
Mr Peter Mann, the club's vice-president, told The Herald yesterday: ``We do
not recommend that people use pet shops or dealers who are associated with
puppy farms. Anyone buying a puppy should use a KC registered dog breeder and
insist on seeing the mother of the litter.''
Mrs Aileen Hamilton, manager of the Dalkeith Pet Hotel and Grooming Centre,
said: ``A lot of these dogs coming in to be trimmed are of such poor quality
they are hardly recognisable as the breed they are supposed to be.''
She said te puppy farms used sub-standard conditions to ``mass produce'' the
puppies.
``Poor quality dogs which normally would not be used for breeding are being
used to meet the high demands of the public. While the practice is not illegal
I believe it is immoral.''
Mrs Hamilton, who breeds about three or four litters of Westies each year,
added: ``Puppy farms are breeding disasters and unsuspecting people are buying
them.''
Ms Anna Fox, of the Scottish Kennel Club, believes the demand for Westies,
which cost about #300 each, is unlikely to fade given that a new series of
Macbeth is to be shown in the new year.

Washington
A POWERFUL earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale struck Russia's Kuril
Islands north of Japan today, but the US National Earthquake Centre said there
were no immediate reports of deaths or damage.
Centre spokesman John Minsch said the earthquake was centred off the sparsely
populated island chain about 810 miles north of Tokyo.
He said the centre had recorded the earthquake as measuring 8.0 on the
open-ended Richter scale, which would make it a serious seismic event
outstripping all but a handful of history's most damaging quakes.
He said, however, that the centre had thus far received no reports of deaths or
damage in the Kurils, a string of Russian-administered islands off Japan's
northern tip.
Minsch said tidal wave, or tsunami, warnings had been issued for regions of the
Pacific but had since been cancelled after it was determined that no there was
no threat of a ``Pacific-wide'' tidal wave.
The Kurils experienced a quake of roughly similar magnitude last year which
killed 10 people, Minsch said.
Earthquakes rated 5.0 or higher are considered capable of causing moderate
damage in urban areas. However the nature of the scale means a 6.0 earthquake
would release 30 times the energy of a 5.0 tremor and can cause building
collapse and loss of life.
Geologists say that an earthquake that registers 7.0 to 7.9 can cause
widespread heavy damage and casualties. A quake of 8.0 and above is capable of
tremendous damage.
The 1985 earthquake that killed some 8000 people in Mexico City was recorded at
8.1 on the Richter scale, while San Francisco's famous 1906 quake measured
8.3.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>GEC loses #90m radar contract</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975061043</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONICS and defence giant GEC suffered a serious blow yesterday after the
Philippines government scrapped a massive radar deal designed to cover the
country's entire civil and military needs.
Details of the cancellation of the contract, worth nearly #90m to GEC-Marconi,
were widely reported in the Sunday newspapers in Manila.
Speaking from the capital, a spokesman for GEC-Marconi, a major GEC subsidiary
whose interests span torpedos to radars and which has a plant in Donibristle,
Fife, said: ``If true, we are naturally bitterly disappointed, but we have not
been informed.
``We need to consider our position and at the moment it would be inappropriate
to comment further.''
The spokesman described the contract as ``very big indeed''. It was won in the
face of ferocious competition against other European and worldwide electronics
and defence contractors.
GEC-Marconi, which has an annual turnover of #2500m and generates a third of
GEC's profits, has a signed contract with the Philippines government for the
radar deal, which was designed to provide a dual civil and military radar
system to cover the entire country.
The spokesman described the radar as a ``Rolls-Royce system'' and one which
would have been self-financing over a period of time.
President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines is understood to have abandoned the
contract following increasing pressure from Senator John Osmena who, it is
alleged, claimed the deal was overpriced. A direct beneficiary of the
cancellation is thought to be the French electronics giant Thomson CSF.
The group is expected to report half-year pre-tax profits which the City
believes will reach #412m for the six months to the end of September, compared
with #378m in the corresponding period last year.
Cancellation of the contract comes at a particularly sensitive time for GEC,
one of the UK's biggest exporters, following a major boardroom row last month
which resulted in a senior director being removed from the board.
Richard Reynolds, chairman of the group's telecommunications subsidiary GPT,
made his annoyance quite clear over the way in which GEC was looking for a
successor to Lord Weinstock, the 71-year-old managing director who is to step
down next year.

PADDLE maker Alistair Wilson's ambition is to ensure that the winner of the
canoeing gold medal in next year's Olympic Games in Atlanta crosses the finish
line with the help of Lendal Products equipment.
At this year's World Canoeing Championships in Nottingham, every individual
medal winner used a Lendal paddle.
Lendal Products has been making paddles in its Prestwick workshop since 1972
when Mr Wilson and his wife, Marianne, founded the company but it is only
recently that new techniques have revolutionised the business and brought mass
production within reach of what had been a craft industry.
``In the past when paddles were made of wood, it would take five days for the
entire process to be completed but now we use thermal plastic and the entire
process can be completed in 10 minutes,'' said Mr Wilson.
``We now have the potential to make as many tubes for paddles as we want. In
the past, we would perhaps be able to make 30 tubes every day. Now we can make
one every two               minutes.''
Despite the introduction of machine processes, each paddle is still a highly
technical object and is made to very high standards.
``We have a responsibility to ensure that our products can withstand the
tremendous strain a paddle is under when it is being thrust through the
water,'' said Mr Wilson. ``If a canoeist is five miles offshore and his paddle
breaks, he is not going to be very pleased. One broken paddle can put someone's
life in danger.''
He speaks from a personal knowledge of the sport as both he and Marianne
represented Britain in the Tokyo Olympics. Mr Wilson still canoes across the
eight miles of sea which separates Ailsa Craig from the Ayrshire coast.
Lendal Products introduced the thermal moulded plastic blades last year with
the help of a regional enterprise grant after its accountants, BDO Stoy
Hayward, put together a business plan. Lendal uses its own design and
production system and expects to increase its workforce of seven to keep up
with demand.
Orders are now coming in from Japan, South Africa, Australia, Hong Kong, and
the United States.
``We recently supplied between 400 and 500 blades to the US and have the
potential to grow as big as we want,'' said Mr Wilson.

JOHN MAJOR's good deed and a Scottish law firm's transfer deed have been
selected for awards by anti-gobbledegook campaigners.
The Plain Language Commission has given the Prime Minister its Golden Rhubarb
Trophy for the most baffling Government document of 1995 - an 11,000-word
booklet on the Northern Ireland peace process.
Picking up the Bronze Rhubarb Trophy is Edinburgh legal firm Tods Murray WS for
archaic language in a deed of transfer.
It struggles its way through more than 200 words with the help of two sets of
brackets, two ``herebys'', a ``thereof'', a ``hereinafter'', and just one comma.
These two, along with Silver Rhubarb Trophy winner NatWest Bank for ``the worst
gobbledegook in a `simple guide' to mortgages'', receive vacuum-packed sticks
of the fruit.
Mr Martin Cutts, director of the Stockport-based research firm, described
Frameworks For The Future, outlining the peace settlement proposals, as
``rambling, repetitive, jargon-filled, and incomprehensible to its target
audience''.
One sentence runs to 121 words compared to the commission's recommendation of
15 or 20-word sentences for a complex subject.
``Mr Major's foreword declares three times that everyone should read the
booklet and voice their opinions but it's brimming with terms like `cognizant
of either option and open to its democratic realisation', `embrace the totality
of relationships', and `quantum of public expenditure'.
``Belfast people who queued for a copy were so annoyed they nominated it for
the accolade.''
Meanwhile, Mr David Anderson of Tods Murray said the transfer deed had been
used in the same form for 20 years and had provoked no complaints.
He added: ``We agree wholeheartedly that all consumer contracts should be in
plain, intelligible language. However, that does not mean that it is either
necessary or desirable that they should be in colloquial language.
``In our view it is perfectly clear and understandable.''
The contents of the deed include - We ....... do hereby assign and transfer to
the said person or persons (if more than one person equally between them and to
the survivor of them) (who and whose successors and assignees are hereinafter
referred to as ``the transferee'') the Holiday Certificate for Weekly Period
Number 00 of Highland Lodge of the Loch Rannoch Highland Club, by virtue of
which Holiday Certificate we as the holders thereof are entitled to occupy the
said unit which is more particularly described in the said Holiday Certificate
for the said period in each year all in terms of and with and under the
conditions specified in the Constitution of the said club including the
obligation to pay all management charges due by the holders of the said Holiday
Certificate ..... in witness whereof these presents are executed at .....''

A RUGBY club was in mourning yesterday after one of its top players was found
dead.
Mr George Dickson, 31, was due to play in a National League match for Borders
club St Boswell's on Saturday.
But after he failed to keep an appointment in the morning, friends called at
his home and found his body.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out today.
Club secretary David Elliot said: ``We are all devastated. George was one of
the most popular guys in the team. He had been a member of the club since he
was at primary school and had played for our first team for many seasons.''
Mr Elliot added: ``He missed two months of this season after breaking his
collar-bone in one of the first matches. But he returned to action a couple of
weeks ago and seemed delighted to be back in the fray.''
Mr Dickson, a barman in a local hotel, was single. His parents, who also live
in the town, were too upset to speak yesterday.
St Boswell's scheduled home match against Ardrossan Accies was called off just
an hour before kick-off after the news of the tragedy spread around the
tight-knit community.
Mr Dickson's funeral is expected to be held on Thursday.

CAN there be, anywhere in the world, a more blatantly beautiful coastline than
that of the Sorrento Peninsula? I doubt it. Our ancestors knew what they were
doing when they featured it prominently on their Grand Tours, built stately
villas-with-a-view there, and painted it from every aspect.
Across the ridiculously azure waters its northern shores face Naples, with
Vesuvius obligingly providing the drama; at night, with the lights beginning to
reflect, the scene is achingly romantic. By day it is the drive along the
corkscrewing southern Amalfi corniche, stopping to photograph pastel-coloured
villages clinging precariously to the craggy mountains, that ensures lasting
memories.
The grande dame of the peninsula is undoubtedly Sorrento; in her prime at the
turn of the century, her charms may seem a trifle faded now but the good bones
are still in evidence. An example of the period flavour is the Grand Hotel
Vigtoria Excelsior. Even if you are not staying here, do call in to admire the
painted ceilings, rococo plasterwork, gilded mirrors, marble floors, and
picture Caruso in residence. Sit, Campari Soda in hand, among the oleander
trees on the terrace and observe, far, far below, the buzzing Marina Piccola. A
private lift will take you down (otherwise it's a bus ride or a taxingly steep
ravine hike).
Sorrento is the base for numerous excursions, and from the Marina run all
manner of craft, rusty-old and jet-new to Capri, Ischia, Naples and Amalfi.
Tempting though it is to squeeze all these into a holiday, plus Vesuvius,
Pompeii, and even Rome by coach, do leave some time for Sorrento itself.
First impressions of the frenetic main highway, the Corso d'Italia, may fail to
charm, but I found the town grew on me as I explored more deeply. Parallel with
the Corso, off the main square, the Piazza Tasso, runs the Via Fuoro, a cool
alleyway lined with tiny shops which offer a glimpse of the character of the
old Sorrento. Here you will find not only tourist trash but examples of the
town's specialities - leather, jewellery and marquetry.
In high summer, when the temperature soars to the nineties and above, the
siesta hour gets quadrupled and the shutters stay down until 5.30. This is the
time to take a cool stroll and perhaps make some purchases, since the exchange
rate is favourable. It is also a good time to indulge in another Italian
speciality, the gelato. Look on the right hand side for the Sorrento Inn, where
42 varieties are made as they have been for four generations, from real eggs,
real cream, real fruit.
Walk through quiet leafy lanes and steep cobbled alleys by fin-de-siecle
villas, down to the Marina Grande, the fishing harbour, to eat at one of the
simple trattorie that ring the waterside. An insalata Caprese (tomatoes and
mozzarella salad), with grilled sardines and a carafe of vino blanco wIll cost
less than #6. Yellow and white striped bathing huts built out on a jetty evoke
the image of frolicking bathing belles and their moustachioed escorts.
Sorrento's main beach is down here, But don't get too excited. Beaches are
emphatically not what you come to the region for.
The proximity of Vesuvius gives a clue to the colour of the sand, if any, and
the water in the harbour would not pass any EU test. The Italians don't mind.
They thrive on noise and close proximity, and there is plenty of both on Marina
Grande beach. In high summer it seems impossible to squeeze one more body into
the vociferous rows, whose occupants stop shouting to their loved ones only to
step into the murky, litter-ridden depths with every appearance of delight.
Number one excursion should be the unsurpassable Amalfi coast, either by coach,
which includes a stop in the delightful unspoiled hill-top village of Ravello,
or by boat, allowing two swims on the way and a chance to shop in Positano's
chic and unusual boutiques.
A 15-minute jet ride away is the legendary Isle of Capri, with eponymous main
town and Anacapri a steep bus ride away.
There has always been rivalry between the two settlements, the Capresi looking
down (figuratively speaking) on the peasants up the hill, and the Anacapresi
maintaining that while the marauding Saracens raped the female inhabitants of
the lower slopes, debasing the blood, they never had the strength to climb the
mountain, so the locals can still claim to be descendants of the noble Greeks.
Those, like me, who remember the natural elegance of the old Capri, when the
little town was an international fashion centre, might mourn the advent of the
trainer-and-shorts day tripper influx, but in the evening, when the mob has
sailed away, the atmosphere is little changed. The photographic Piazzetta, the
hub of all socialising, is as pretty as ever, still mercifully traffic-free,
with goods and luggage being transported by hand-carts. You cannot see the sky
from here, so tightly packed are the huge cream parasols of the cafes,
sheltering the onlookers of the non-stop parade. The cost of a freshly squeezed
orange drink here - around #4 - is justified by the free entertainment.
From the Piazzetta runs a maze of narrow lines, lined with dazzlingly white
walls. Most tourists, sheeplike, follow the Via V Emanuele, bordered with
international couturiers and jewellers, who find ready customers in the patrons
of the luxurious hotel, the Quisisana, at the end of the parade; very few
bother to explore further than the Certosa di San Giacomo, which admittedly
offers superb views.
The lucky residents will have time and inclination in the early morning or
evening to climb ancient stone steps, and follow the paths high above the
little town, past flowery gardens and unexpected glimpses of the turquoise sea
below. Try turning left at the Quisisana along the Via Camerelle to the Punta
Tragara and keep going along the coast path, past the deep cave complete with
Roman remains, to the Arco Naturale, a natural limestone arch that frames a
perfect sunset shot of the distinctive Faraglioni rocks.
Anacapri is cooler, cheaper, less crowded, except at the bus depot where the
hordes disembarked to visit the villa of San Michele and to take a marvellous
funicular ride to the summit of Monte Solaro. Swinging silently high above the
vineyards it is strikingly cool and peaceful and the ultimate reward is the
view awaiting at the summit of the whole island and particularly the Faraglioni.
Otherwise the trick is to do whatever the other tourists are not. As the
minibuses roar up the hill to disgorge their contents in the centre, hop on a
local bus and take a 60p ride through the countryside to Il Faro, the
lighthouse marking Punta Carena in the south-west of the island. From the rocks
below you can swim in the bluest of blue. By five o'clock the tourists will be
back on their coaches and it is safe to do to the Blue Grotto, another bus-ride
from the town. Swimming solitarily into the truly azure cave is infinitely
preferable to paying for a jostling boat-ride.
The rest of Anacapri is a delightfully sleepy backwater, whose residents
assemble every evening in the main square, to sit on lovely green and yellow
tiled benches, watching the well-dressed children play and catching up on the
latest gossip. Tucked away in the Piazza San Nicola is the church of San
Michele, whose entire floor is covered in eighteenth-century majolica tiles
depicting a charmingly naive Garden of Eden.
Without doubt the best time to visit southern Italy is spring and autumn. A
combination of Sorrento and Capri, flying from Glasgow, costs from #399.

THE people of Laggan have won a four-year campaign to assume control of the
3500-acre Strathmashie Forest, making it Britain's first community forest.
The move, predicted by The Herald last month, is seen as the most significant
and radical development in rural policy in the Highlands for generations.
Yet the commitment of Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth has gone virtually
unreported.
He made the announcement on Thursday night at the end of his speech at
Strathclyde University on the future of Scotland.
Having dealt with constitutional matters, Mr Forsyth turned to the Government's
proposal to hand over control of the Scottish Office-owned crofting estates to
local crofting trusts.
He quoted an article by Highland writer and historian Dr James Hunter.
Mr Forsyth said: ``Our political opponents may be content just to sing
sentimentally about their wee bit hill and glen, but we give the land back to
the people who can manage it best. Similarly with forestry there is an
opportunity for the empowerment of local communities.
``There is currently much discussion, some of it embodied in the Rural White
Paper to be published shortly, about how forestry can contribute to the
well-being of those who live in rural Scotland.
``I want action as well as discussion. That is why I intend to visit Laggan to
explore with the people there practical ways of bringing the local forestry
plantation under community control.
``They have ideas about using the forest to greater local benefit and I believe
they should have the opportunity to try them out. I will therefore set up a
pilot scheme there.''
Although the financial arrangements for a forest whose estimated value ranges
from #750,000 to #2m are still to be worked out, it is understood Mr Forsyth
had to overcome considerable opposition before he could make his announcement.
This came not least from his own Forestry Minister Lord Lindsay and from the
Forestry Commission, which in recent years has been dealing with the highest
bidder, the commercial sector, rather than local communities when disposing of
any significant sections of its 1.5m acres.
In Laggan, where the population this century has dropped from more than 1000 to
about 200, it was clear the announcement held the key to the community's
future. Dr Ian Richardson, a retired doctor who has been one of the local
campaigners, said: ``There is an extraordinary feeling of optimism here now.
``It has been a real tonic, particularly to the young people who see in this
Laggan forest initiative a means of having a life in their own place,'' Dr
Richardson said.
``Mr Forsyth must get enormous credit for that. Instead of just talking, he has
done something.''
Dr Richardson said funds for a survey into local attitudes had been diverted
towards determining the skills local people could bring to the undertaking.
Fencing and forestry contractor Mr David Campbell, who has lived in Laggan for
the past 35 years, said: ``It is great, unbelievable, so welcome in an area
where there are only two men under the age of 30 in full-time employment
locally.
``The potential is enormous - from adding value to the timber products to
establishing the first forest walks for blind and disabled people. It is not
only Laggan, the whole of Badenoch can benefit from this.''
Meanwhile, historian Dr Hunter said yesterday the announcement was of enormous
importance to the whole of Britain.
``This development is considerably more significant than the proposed transfer
of all the publicly-owned crofting estates which has been attended by such
publicity,'' Dr Hunter said. ``In the first place, the Laggan forest represents
a considerable asset in financial terms, thousands of acres of mature timber.
``The crofting estates are restricted to the marginal land on the western
periphery, but there are publicly owned forests throughout the country. A
precedent is now being set in Laggan which could lead towards the Scandinavian
model of community-managed forests. These provide a stability of local
employment through environmentally - sensitive management.''

AN RAF pilot's method of delivering Christmas presents to his mother's house,
by using his helicopter, was last night under investigation by his commanders.
Squadron Leader Gavin Davey, 37, landed his #6m Puma helicopter in a field next
to the mansion home of his mother, Sheena, on the main street of Abernethy,
Perthshire, last week and then delivered the gifts, which included two mountain
bikes.
Mr Davey is based at Aldergrove, outside Belfast, and the helicopter is used in
Northern Ireland for surveillance work.
His mother was not available for comment last night. His stepfather, Mr David
Shepherd, defended him. ``Gavin followed all RAF landing procedures,'' he said.
``The local police were informed. He did nothing wrong.''
He said he dropped off ``presents including mountain bikes for his sons who are
coming to stay with us over Christmas. I don't know who is complaining. Our
neighbours and friends are very supportive. The whole thing seems like a storm
in a teacup.''
There had been reports that some villagers complained about the waste of
tax-payers' money by the squadron leader, who has apparently arrived by
helicopter on previous occasions.
Schoolboy Tim Coles, 16, said: ``He has been dropping in by helicopter on and
off for the last ten years.
``The first time he did it, I was at primary school and half of the village
rushed down to see him land and take off. Most people accept it now as part of
village life, but a few do moan about it.''
A shopkeeper said it was ``not unusual to see Gavin buzzing about in his
helicopter''.
An RAF spokeswoman confirmed the squadron leader had made the landing last
Monday and said: ``Checks will be made. We don't want the public thinking that
pilots are using RAF aircraft willy nilly for private purposes.''
She added: ``The helicopter was en route from Lossiemouth to Otterburn and did
not divert.''
She said landing permission had been sought.
``He has landed there before to show the aircraft to village schoolchildren,''
she added.

EXCLUSIVE
PARENTS are exploiting the Government's opting-out legislation to fight the
closure of a secondary school which is less than 40% full and needs #780,000
worth of urgent repairs.
Strathclyde Region has proposed the closure next June of Glasgow's Garthamlock
Secondary, which was badly damaged by fire in May.
The authority wants to merge it with Lochend Secondary in Easterhouse or,
alternatively, pupils could be sent to Lochend or Smithycroft Secondary in
Carntyne, depending on their feeder primaries.
It is thought to be the only local authority to seek a school closure in the
months before the existing regions are replaced by the single-tier councils in
April.
A consultative document which will go before the region's ruling Labour group
today, puts forward educational and financial grounds for closing the school.
It had a capacity of nearly 1100 pupils before a major fire in October, but the
current roll of 415 is projected to fall further over the next five years.
If, as expected, Labour councillors endorse the report, it will go before the
education committee on Wednesday before being issued for consultation with a
six-week timescale for responses.
However, as a first step towards thwarting the closure plans, the school board
is tomorrow night expected to back a motion calling for a ballot on opting out.
Board chairman Mr George Boor said yesterday: ``There are gang fights between
Easterhouse and Garthamlock boys every day of the week. If you had them in the
same school you can imagine what would happen.
``We don't want the school to opt out, just to keep it open.''
A ballot would not prevent Strathclyde from consulting on the proposals - but
it would halt their implementation for six months or longer.
A decision this week to have a ballot must be reconsidered by the board again
within six weeks. If ratified, the board must inform the authority and the
Scottish Office and hold the ballot within three months.
If fewer than half the parents vote, a second ballot must be completed within
14 days. If that vote is in favour, the board must submit its proposals for
running a self-governing school to the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Forsyth,
within one month.
In Garthamlock's case, he would reject opting out because of the school's roll
and the capital expenditure needed.
The school was one of 13 unidentified Scottish secondaries which the Accounts
Commission recently said could be readily closed because they were less than
60% full and there were adequate local alternatives for pupils.
The local authorities' financial watchdog also called on the Government to
provide extra cash for schools receiving pupils from closing establishments to
enable them to offer excellent facilities from day one.
Strathclyde operates a self-insurance scheme and, if closure goes ahead, the
authority recommends using the #780,000 which would have gone on repairing the
fire damage at Garthamlock to improving facilities at the receiving schools.
Strathclyde had considered closing Garthamlock some time ago but held off to
see whether its roll benefited from other school closures in the area.
A region report states, however, that the continuing small roll makes it
increasingly difficult to offer pupils a full course choice and a broad,
balanced curriculum.
A merger with Lochend would give it a roll of more than 1100 pupils. If
Garthamlock's pupils transferred to Lochend or Smithycroft, the former's roll
would rise to more than 1000, the latter's to 800.
Under either option there would be revenue savings of more than #500,000 a year.
Dr Malcolm Green, a senior Strathclyde councillor who speaks on education for
the new City of Glasgow Council, said yesterday: ``I hope that publication of
this document will enable the whole community in Garthamlock to engage
seriously with the dilemma we face.''
The new council will be under severe pressure to tackle surplus places because
its revenue budget will be much smaller than Strathclyde's.
Meanwhile, parents of pupils at Gateside Primary, near Beith, Ayrshire, who
signed a petition calling for a ballot to opt-out, have changed their minds.
They want to withdraw their signatures - which would lead to the scrapping of
the ballot.
Cunninghame North Labour MP Brian Wilson said yesterday: ``As far as I am aware
about 40 of the people who signed the 49-name petition have had second thoughts.
``Many now feel they were misled. They thought they were signing a petition
calling for information about a ballot.
"They are now seeking legal advice to see if their names can be withdrawn
following assurances that the question of closing the school does not arise and
the school is safe for the foreseeable future.''
Mr Wilson added: ``If they succeed there will be no need for a ballot. But I am
writing to the Secretary of State asking him not to let a ballot to go ahead''
When the school board received the petition they had no option but to call for
an opting-out ballot.

THE financial services industry has come in for a great deal of criticism and
Peter Griffiths-Buchanan, managing director of Whitelaw Wells Financial
Planning, believes much is justified.
He points out that, while all 102,000 financial advisers have their Financial
Planning Certificate which is the minimum qualification required by the
Personal Investment Authority, only some 1500 have taken the Advanced Financial
Planning Certificate, and less than 40 people are Fellows of the Institute of
Financial Planning.
``I have my advanced certificates and I hope to gain my fellowship next year,''
said Mr Griffiths-Buchanan, who claims the industry is better qualified in
other countries. In the United States, 30,000 hold the equivalent qualification
to the fellowship and almost 600 in Australia.
``I was a qualified engineer before I entered the financial services industry
and I was schooled in the principle that you required qualifications before you
could work at certain levels. I believe that attitude must be introduced into
financial planning.''
Mr Griffiths-Buchanan became a financial adviser when he arrived in this
country from South Africa in 1987.
His strong views on how the industry should be run come from his belief in the
need for sound financial advice.
``My family had a small farming estate in New Cumnock and my father was
eventually left #100,000 in 1972 when my grandfather died. My father was never
given any advice on how to invest the inheritance and by 1992 it was only worth
#40,000.''
He believes the financial consultants should move towards being a fee earning
industry rather than taking commission. ``I charge fees because I want my
clients to be in no doubt that the advice they receive is objective and not
clouded by commission objectives.''
Whitelaw Wells charges an average of #72 per hour and Mr Griffiths-Buchanan
said that between 30% and 40% of his clients were better off than they would
have been if the business had been done on a commission basis.
``For about half of my clients, there is no financial difference in the two
sytems but it removes any doubts about my motives,'' he said. ``But I accept
that the fee payment method does not become cost effective until a person earns
around #30,000 a year.''

AFTER the Budget and the flurry of interest rate speculation last week, there
is only a light diet of official statistics to feed off this week.
The narrow measure of the money supply, M0, due to be published later today, is
expected to rise by 0.6%, taking the annual rate up from 5.2% in October to
5.6% last month.
James Capel's Adam Cole is forecasting a bounce-back in manufacturing output in
Wednesday's production figures for October. He expects manufacturing to post a
gain of 0.3%. This would raise the annual rate from 0.6% to 0.9%.
TODAY - Reserves (November); M0 (November). TOMORROW - None announced.
WEDNESDAY - Index of production (October). THURSDAY - CBI survey of
distributive trades (November). FRIDAY - None announced.

<TEXT>
FLORIDA health authorities have suspended a doctor for six months and fined him
$10,000 (#6600) for mistakenly cutting off the wrong leg of a patient in a
botched amputation.
The Florida Board of Medicine also gave Dr Rolando Sanchez a formal reprimand,
imposed two years' probation under the supervision of another surgeon, and
required him to attend a class in ``risk management education''.
``The risk management part of the decision is the most appropriate,'' said Dr
Fred Reddy, a former president of the Hillsborough County Medical Association.
Sanchez's medical licence was already suspended in July after another patient
at a different hospital complained he had amputated one of her toes without
permission during a foot operation.
The wrong-leg amputation, which drew national attention, occurred at Tampa's
University Community Hospital last February.
In a three-day hearing on the case earlier this year, Sanchez and his lawyer
argued that mistakes by other hospital staffers - including preparing the wrong
leg for surgery - and the severely diseased condition of both of the patient's
legs led Sanchez to believe he was operating on the correct limb.
Sanchez himself testified that he only learned of his mistake when an attending
nurse, reviewing the patient's file, began to shake and cry. By then it was too
late to reverse the operation.
The patient, 52-year-old Willie King, had his diseased leg removed at another
hospital. He has received a $1.2m (#800,000) settlement from Sanchez and the
hospital. The board's ruling took into account the 140 days Sanchez has already
been suspended, meaning he could be back in the operating room by next
month.-Reuter.

YOUR editorial on December 1 claims the way ahead on devolution is clear and of
course it is easy to reach that conclusion if you ignore, as you do in the
discussion, some arguments and choose to misrepresent others.
You suggest the results of the British Social Attitudes Survey point towards an
assembly in Edinburgh. But surely the disillusion people feel towards
poliicians is an argument against and not for another tier of government.
Mr Major, you say but without supporting evidence, ignores the fact that
Scotland is a separate nation.
Throughout his five years as Prime Minister he has returned repeatedly to the
question of better government for Scotland. He has enhanced the role of the
Scottish Secretary and the Scottish Office. He has maintained Scottish Office
funding and in all his speeches and interviews, etc, he has never suggested
that Scotland is somehow subordinate to England.
But, and it is a very big but, he believes, as all Unionists believe, that the
value of the Union to all the people of the United Kingdom is greater than the
sum of its parts and that anything which threatens to break up that Union must
be resisted.
You go on to say that Mr Major is opposed to devolution, but what he is
actually saying is that a devolved assembly in Edinburgh with the power to
raise taxes is a long-term threat to the Union. Conflict between Edinburgh and
London over finance and other issues is inevitable even though it might not
manifest itself for the first couple of years.
Scotland's over-representation at West-minster could not be sustained and the
two governments would drift apart and thus independence becomes the only
alternative.
The SNP certainly see it that way and are happy to go along with it even though
the vast majority of people in Scotland wish to preserve the Union.
More immediate is the question of the tax-raising powers. George Robertson says
taxes could go down as well as up, or more likely he suggests not be changed.
Before the last election Neil Kinnock said Labour would retain the nuclear
deterrent but would never use it. George Robertson's assertion on the
tax-raising powers is similar and equally facile.
The Scottish Labour Party are by inclination more akin to Old Labour than New
Labour and if their record in local government is anything to go by the
likelihood must be that taxes will go up. Any tax increase is a tax on jobs, a
tax on people's choice, and a disincentive to investment.
No-one has enjoyed the tax increases since 1992 and understandably the
Government has suffered in popularity, but we now seem to be on a downward path
again. That must not be put at risk, particularly in one part of the UK on its
own.
In your editorial you make no mention of the role of Scottish Secretary, if we
had an assembly in Edinburgh. His position would be anomalous to say the least
and if he is not sitting at the Cabinet table daily fighting his corner
Scotland will be the loser and friction and misunderstanding between the two
governments will rise.
As yet we have not seen any real discussion about the most recent proposals put
forward by Michael Forsyth. The opposition parties have chosen to dismiss them
out of hand, but surely these ideas deserve more serious analysis and as an
independent newspaper you could do that. There are proposals for other forms of
devolution there which merit consideration.
I have to to disagree with your conclusion. They way ahead is far from clear
and the debate must go on.
Michael Ashmore,
Chairman, Clydesdale Conservative and Unionist Association,
Hozier House, Lanark.

A REPORT into the way Scots hospitals communicate with patients has called for
improved complaints procedures to be put in place.
The study by the Scottish Office Audit Unit also urges greater effort in
obtaining the views of patients and highlights some hospitals' ``piecemeal''
reviews of their signposting which, in many cases, was poor. However, the
report concluded that communication standards were generally improving,
particularly in general hospital booklets.
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton welcomed the findings, but
recommended further action.
``The Patient's Charter,'' he said, ``emphasised the importance of better
communications between the NHS and those who use the services, and I am
delighted the performance of the NHS in this area is improving.
``But more remains to be done, and I have asked health boards and NHS Trusts to
use the action checklist in the report to help them make further progress. For
our part, we are well-advanced in bringing new complaints procedures into force
as from next April.''
The report said the quality of clinical communication was variable, with scope
for providing better written information and more support to patients in
explaining information and counselling them.

IT is remarkable. You don't usually get pneumonia among your calves if you
breed your own and keep them at home, yet that has been the big excitement this
week.
I had been busy and had been throwing the feed at them and skimping on even
looking at them for five minutes.
It's an easy job. The heifers get one bag of nuts and the bulls get two. They
are bedded twice a week and they need a new bale of treated straw about every
five days. So if you are going to skimp it's fairly easy. You can feed the 100
beasts in half an hour, nae bother.
Finally, on Saturday I noticed. One of the bulls did not get up for his nuts.
Usually they stampede at you but there was only a half-hearted wander over to
the trough. To my horror, I realised that a fine black Simmental calf was
impersonating a bellows. And worse than that, he wasn't just heaving the air in
and out. He had that jerk in his breathing that shakes the whole body and so
often means that what you need is the knackery.
In the days when I had up to 400 barley beef bulls, we used to have chronic
pneumonia. There was never a time when we didn't have a few being treated and
at least one whose lungs were damaged and who was taking his revenge on my bank
balance. That kind would save you so much money if they would just die.
Of course, those barley beefers were collected up from all the dairy farms
around about and dealers would roll up with small lots of third-raters which
they couldn't sell. I'd always give them a bid of some kind. Unfortunately, I
so often got not merely extra calves, but more to add to the Little Ardo
pneumonia bank.
The vets weren't much help. I suspect it was just that we called them in when
it was too late. But on one occasion when our usual remedies weren't working, I
announced my intention to try the vet again.
``Well,'' said Gordon the cattleman, ``If you're phoning the vet you may as
well phone the knackery at the same time.''
That remark came back to me on Saturday as I surveyed the cream of the crop of
1995. There was another and another and another - maybe. We haven't seen any
respiratory problems since we came back from Kenya. Six cough-free years, and
there they were again.
So I called the vet despite my fears about sending good money after bad.
My natural honesty forces me to admit that when I saw that it was yet another
young lady vet I wasn't pleased.
To me, a vet should be about 55, rather overweight and male.
Those older vets went into the profession when it had no glamour and academic
standards were not the priority. They were practical chaps who would have
preferred to be farmers but hadn't the capital. They came to the profession
without much intellectual baggage and they made good vets.
Don't get me wrong. The calves died just the same, but with the old school you
get a certain reassurance in their presence.
James Herriot changed all that. He glamorised the life of a vet and chocked the
vet schools. They had no alternative but to ration places to the brightest.
When a vet under 30 comes on to the place you can be sure you are being visited
by an intellectual giant whose natural environment is the lecture theatre
rather than the byre.
Anyway, this slip of a girl came up to the byre to see the worst case which I
had tied up, not that it was going anywhere. My fears that she wouldn't know
what she was looking at were reinforced when she didn't seem impressed with the
nearness of death. It was agreed that she would give the calf an intravenous
injection and a course of other stuff into the muscle.
After a brief look in the court, she said I could pull out the coughers and
give then a jab of the intramuscular stuff and that would be about it.
I got a pen for five out in our open-fronted shed and made them comfortable.
With fearful heart I looked in the court the next day and, yes, there were two
more sets of bellows in action. And then down to the sick bay expecting to find
one dead and the others below average.
To my astonishment, there were no bellows going and even the `dead' one came to
eat.
The vet may have been too young, too intelligent, too thin and too female, but
she seems to have saved my calf and goodness knows how much money.
n I'm not as keen as the boys on killing things, though I do like the social
side of shooting. I'm happiest with the gun when I can call it pest control
rather than ``sport''.  Sport, I think, should be enjoyed by both sides and
that doesn't seem to me to reflect accurately what happens at most shoots.
We got an invitation to help a friend at Forfar who is overrun with hares. He
told us we could take a pheasant too, but cocks only.
We were taken aback when the first bird to rise was a hen pheasant and our host
shot it. Nothing was said but the second pheasant to get up was a cock. It was
Potions' but he let it go.
``It's okay,'' said our host kindly, ``you can shoot cocks.''
``Oh, said Potions. ``I thought that must be a hen 'cos it was different from
the one you shot.''
We may not be invited back.

WHEN I was growing up, or trying to, the most important people in my life were
my mum and dad, my two brothers, and my sister. They gave me security and,
although I didn't appreciate it then, a whole lot of love. Yes, every family
has its ups and downs, arguments and squabbles and I remember them as well, but
I remember most of all our happy times together as a family.
Now adult, well sort of, I now lead my own separate life and we have drifted
apart, at least physically, but we keep in touch regularly by telephone and,
whenever possible, we visit each other on a regular basis. I suppose we like to
think of ourselves, at least I do, as being fully detached from the ``Old
Bat's'' apron strings; mother's family nick-name because of her great affection
for flying mammals.
As a single parent, keeping in touch with my family is not easy. Doing so
requires a bucketful of planning and careful cash-husbandry. Indeed, without
the support of my family, and the support of a caring society, a reasonable
life as a single parent would be pretty damn near impossible. I am ever more
aware, particularly as Christmas draws near, of the importance and comfort of a
stable family environment.
As I look at my daughter, Jessica, soon to be three years young, thoughts of
Christmas past come flooding back; the excitement of stockings by the chimney;
the sound of wrapping paper being opened on Christmas morning, the smell of
Christmas lunch; the obligatory, cold, brisk, Boxing Day walk by the sea; a
family, together, sharing their joy and their sadness.
I like to think of Jessica and myself as being a family but, realistically, it
could be a long time before I can create that sort of magic for my daughter.
``Family'' presupposes the presence of a father and the nearest Jessica has
ever got to hers, so far, is a brief glimpse of a denim-clad bum in the far
distance. Once in nearly three years.
OK, a mother's love is all a child really needs and single mums are as caring
as nuclear family mums any day of the week. However, few single parents would
deny that, sometimes, we get lonely and that sometimes we wish our child's
natural father would walk through the door and make it all better. With a bit
of luck he will be better-looking too and have a whole new personality and, oh
joy, perhaps even a bulging wallet.
I know this is not going to happen and I feel desperately sorry for Jessica. I
didn't plan it to be that way, but I feel that even before she was born I
stacked up trouble and angst for my daughter. As she grows older she will have
to face up to telling her friends why she does not have a father, why he did
not want her. All I can do is to love her more, make sure that she knows how
important she is, how special she is to me and to her grandparents, aunts, and
uncles.
Families take a lot for granted, small, seemingly inconsequential things; daily
chores, shopping, bumps and bruises, comment and criticism, talking and simply
being there for one another. When I was a child I could not conceive of my
parents not being together. They were always there, together, invariably happy,
and I automatically assumed that, one day, I would be in a similar position
with a husband and family of my own.
I am doing the best I can and over the past year I have created a secure and
happy home for Jessica and myself. We may not have a man about the house, but
then, men do have drawbacks, in spite of their occasional ability to mend a
leaking tap. Who knows, one day Mr Right may appear? Until he does, and proves
that he is indeed Mr Right, Jessica and I will get along just fine, believe me.
Which brings me back to the imminent advent of a family Christmas. I need not
have worried. We will be spending it with my mum, dad, and elder brother and
his family on Deeside. Also, my younger brother, who now lives in Finland, has
invited Jessica and me over beforehand for a December holiday. I can't wait to
see how Jessica reacts to her first flight - and to finding out whether or not
Mr Claus is a bachelor.

Fancy a pint of Skullsplitter or Blackout? Lachie Kennedy looks at what is on
offer to discerning drinkers
A NIGHT out at the local can take on a whole new meaning in some pubs
stretching from the Highlands and Islands to the south coast of England.
Instead of the traditional Scottish request for a ``hauf and a hauf'' you are
as likely to hear someone ask for a pint of Skullsplitter or Blackout. Or the
order might be for a pint of Christmas Noggin or Santa's Tipple.
It's all part of an ongoing revolution by discerning beer drinkers looking for
something different to whet their palates, something to tickle their taste buds
and give them a bit of a kick.
At the same time it is helping with the establishment of small local breweries
as they spring up in towns and cities the length and breadth of the country.
Even some publicans have joined the revolution and now make their own brews on
the premises.
Beer festivals are held where hundreds turn up to sample the latest brews, some
of them so powerful that pubs serve them only in one-third pint measures. Like
Uncle Igor's, a Welsh ale brewed in very small quantities with a mind-boggling
alcohol by volume content of 21%. According to Nick Bromfield, who started his
own Fyfe Brewery Company earlier this year: ``A half pint of Uncle Igor's is
the equivalent of six or seven vodkas, enough to put you well over the drinks
driving limit.''
Most of Mr Bromfield's Auld Alliance is sold in his own Harbour Bar in
Kirkcaldy, although some of his output finds its way to the west coast.
He said: ``Customers seem to like it and as far as I am concerned it has been a
success.''
In Orkney, the Orkney Brewery at Quoyloo, set up in 1988, now produces several
beers, including Skullsplitter, named after Haus Akluis, the Viking seventh
Earl of Orkney, who had a habit of splitting people's skulls with a huge axe.
Earlier this year they introduced a new brew aptly named The Red Macgregor.
Most of their output is ``exported'' to the mainland where it is sold mostly in
Central Scotland but can be found in bars as far south as Bristol and Cardiff.
Ron Hill, manager of the brewery which now employs eight, said: ``Very little
is sold locally.''
Scotland already has 18 independent brewers and six brew pubs with more on the
horizon. Some of them, such as Belhaven, have been around a long time and it
continues to produce award-winning beers supplying 56 of their 65 houses.
The revolution started 25 years ago when four lads on a boozy holiday in
Ireland decided the beer they were supping lacked something and for a ``bit of
a lark'' they formed the now well-known Campaign for Real Ale, Camra, which
quickly attracted hundreds of like-minded beer drinkers. Four years later it
spread to Scotland.
The big boys of the trade were quick to respond to the changes in drinking
habits and rose to the challenge. Scottish and Newcastle, Britain's biggest
brewers, now produce around 30 cask ales which are sold in 70% of their
nationwide chain of 2720 pubs.
Their spokeswoman said: ``It is a buoyant market. The demand for cask ales is
certainly there and they do seem to go down well with the consumer.
``Camra have certainly played their part in bringing real ales to the attention
of the public who enjoy a good beer. We responded and now provide a great
variety of ales because it appears the public like to try different varieties.''
Hotelier Paul Waterson, president-elect of the Scottish Licensed Trade
Association, said: ``Real ales are a part of the market that is growing quite
considerably and seems to be catching on with the younger drinker. It is
helping to bring people back into the pubs.''
Camra's Scottish director, Colin Valentine, said: ``We feel every town should
have a small brewery and this is something we want to encourage.''
Camra now has eight branches in Scotland - Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen,
Inverness, Paisley, Linlithgow, Ayrshire, and Glasgow - boasting a total
membership of 1500.
They regularly hold beer festivals and a recent three-day one in Aberdeen
attracted 2300 real-ale lovers who tested 65 different beers - 20 of them
brewed in Scotland - and between them managed to down 9184 pints.

THE normally sedate world of bowls was rocked at the weekend after a competitor
in the National Fours Championship Playdowns was thrown out of the match after
allegedly verbally abusing an official.
Mr John McLardy, skip of the rink representing the Galleon Club in Kilmarnock,
was told not to turn up for yesterday morning's second round match with
Auchinleck after umpire Mr Roger Black had reported him to Scottish Indoor
Bowling Association officials in attendance at the Playdowns at Paisley.
The alleged incidents took place during the first round match between Galleon
and Newton Stewart which the Ayrshire side won 25-16.
Mr Black, who is also a qualified football referee and spent 20 years on the
official SFA's referee list, said: ``I spoke to the player on a couple of
occasions regarding his general conduct on the green and after the second
warning he launched a verbal attack on me within earshot of various officials
and other bowlers.
``I reported the matter to the SIBA officials' president and was later informed
the player had been disqualified from the event. I think it's an excellent
decision.''
SIBA competitions secretary Mr Dennis Petrie said: ``Following a violation of
the code of conduct during the National Fours Playdowns, Mr John McLardy of the
Galleon Club was disqualified from the competition. The club have been
permitted to field a substitute in place of Mr McLardy.
``We will be asking the Galleon Club at a later date what action they have
taken against the individual concerned and, if satisfied, I would anticipate
that would be an end to the matter,'' Mr Petrie said.
Mr McLardy was replaced by clubmate Mr Willie Mackie for yesterday's match
which they lost 22-7 to Auchinleck.

ROBERTSON DAVIES, one of Canada's most accomplished authors, has died after
suffering a stroke. He was 82.
The author of more than 30 plays and novels, Davies followed a principle he
credited to Mozart, but which was based as well on his own life: take on the
most serious subjects and treat them in the most humorous way.
Also an actor and critic, he was mentioned as a possible winner of the 1993
Nobel Prize for Literature, which was eventually won by the American novelist
and essayist, Toni Morrison.
Davies died on Saturday night in a hospital in Orangeville, 50 miles north west
of Toronto.
His last novel, The Cunning Man, was a best seller this year.
His best known novels, The Lyre of Orpheus (1988), What's Bred in the Bone
(1985) and the three books that constitute the Deptford Trilogy of the 1970s
had a generous mix of greed and murder, adultery and blackmail, heartache and
insanity.
But Davies set a light-hearted, forgiving tone, as if he were a god looking on
with amusement at the humans down on earth.
His eclectic career included stints in academia, as the first head of Massey
College at Toronto University.

<HEADLINE>Scots hospital saves life of unborn baby from Iceland</HEADLINE>

AN Icelandic woman has made four flights to Scotland in a battle to save her
unborn baby.
Berglind Hauksdottir's unborn child became seriously ill just six months into
pregnancy. Obstetric specialists in Reykjavik discovered that it was developing
severe anaemia because its blood group clashed with its mother's.
Its only hope of survival was highly-specialised foetal medical treatment in
Glasgow. The baby's condition was so poor that the specialists decided to fly
Mrs Hauksdottir to the foetal medicine department of the Queen Mother's
Hospital at Yorkhill, where consultant Dr Alan Cameron carried out delicate
blood transfusions to the baby guided by ultra-sound equipment.
``Our baby has improved tremendously,'' said Mrs Hauksdottir. ``When the
doctors in Reykjavik told us how seriously ill the baby was, we feared it
wouldn't survive.
``I only found out during an ante-natal visit and was told to pack my bags and
arrange for someone to take care of my older children because I was going on
the next flight to Glasgow.
``Within 24 hours we were stepping off an Icelandair flight and on our way to
the Queen Mother's Hospital. Now after four transfusions the baby is in great
shape and weighs between four and five pounds - good for 33 weeks into
pregnancy.''
Dr Cameron said Mrs Hauksdottir's baby had a condition called rhesus
incompatibility which occurs when a rhesus-negative blood group mother marries
a rhesus-positive father. If the baby inherits the father's blood type, the
mother can produce antibodies which destroys the foetus's red blood cells.
Without transfusion the baby can die and, if it is born alive, it can suffer
brain              damage.
``In Mrs Hauksdottir's case, we transfused 100mls of blood into the baby once a
fortnight to maintain a healthy red blood count, and we are delighted to say
that the baby is progressing well,'' said Dr Cameron.
``The transfusion is carried out by sedating the mum. The sedatives then pass
through the placenta to the foetus, making it less active during transfusion.
``It would be extremely difficult to transfuse a baby which was trying to run
away from you in the womb.''
Rhesus incompatibility is not a problem for most rhesus-negative mothers. First
babies are not affected and the mothers are almost always given a blood
preparation, anti-D, within 60 hours of their first birth.
However, Mrs Hauksdottir explained: ``I didn't get one when my son Haukur, 11,
was born and Theodor, 3, was anaemic when he was born.
``He recovered after a blood transfusion within hours of birth, and I thought
that the same would happen for this baby, but the problem gets worse with each
pregnancy.
``We owe our baby's life to the Queen Mother's team and to some unknown blood
donor here in Scotland.''
Mrs Hauksdottir's husband, Iolafur 30, has repaid that debt by becoming a blood
donor during his visits here. Holding up his donor's card he said: ``I have
given some of my blood to help save someone else's life. It's the least we
could do.
``It's our first trip to Scotland. We planned to visit some day but never
dreamed that it would be under these circumstances.''
Mrs Hauksdottir will make one final trip to Scotland and go back to Iceland to
have her baby by Caesarean section at 36 weeks.
According to the scans she        is expecting a baby girl. ``It's         a
change after two boys,''               she said.

<HEADLINE>`Insular' attitudes will cost jobs Agency warns companies about the high price of ignoring business markets in Europe</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By IAIN WILSON Chief Reporter</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975061066</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Enterprise officials based on the Continent have warned that business
attitudes at home must change or Scotland will lose out on jobs, exports and
inward investments.
Too many Scottish firms were not only insular but had a real fear of trading
with Europeans - widely regarded as the ``real foreigners'' because they do not
have English as their first language.
The potential for trade has never been better, said David Scrimgeour of Locate
in Scotland and Scottish Trade International's David Roe, both based in Germany.
But they are concerned Eastern Europe - awakening to the business opportunities
- will win the race for the massive capital sums now available for investment
on the Continent.
The next five to 10 years will be crucial if Scotland was not to be truly ``on
the periphery of Europe''.
Mr Scrimgeour, whose task is to secure more inward investment from Germany,
said he wanted a rethink on Scotland's ``unnatural dependance'' on doing
business with the US.
Mr Roe, who is charged with boosting Scotland's export performance, suspected
business was being lost because firms often sought markets in the
English-speaking world, especially America, rather than Europe.
He warned Scotland could become the ``Isle of Wight of Europe'' unless
attitudes changed, and said of the need to look to Europe as a trading partner:
``Our market is not the English-speaking world, it's continental Europe. It
amazes me still that companies feel that the English-speaking world, has to be
the opportunity for them when they can get to Germany in a couple of hours.''
Europeans were keen to do business with Scotland, he said, but too many
Scottish firms saw themselves as companies exporting to Europe rather than
European firms based in Scotland.
Mr Roe said Scottish firms were particularly poor at marketing - tenders for
work were almost always in English, with prices very rarely quoted in
Deutschmarks. Yet businesscould soar tenfold in Germany if Scotland was
promoted properly, he said.
He supported Mr Scrimgeour's call for a long-term strategy which would
concentrate on trade in European markets with huge potential.
Scotland was ``just playing at it'' and Scottish Enterprise needed to look at
what the Germans wanted - then beat off the competition by meeting their
demands.
They want Scotland to press home advantages before Eastern Germany, in
particular, developed the managerial and technological standards required by
its western counterparts.
Their comments are contained in the agency's Enterprise Scotland magazine, to
be distributed to 10,000 Scottish businessmen, politicians, and others later
this week. Mr Scrimgeour said Germany, the second largest exporter in the
world, was ready and willing to invest in the UK, but faced difficulties. These
included Scots being ``too centred in Scotland . . . we think that people know
more about Scotland than they do''.
However, market research showed Scotland was known more as a holiday
destination that as a business location.
Mr Scrimgeour said Scotland might have an unnatural dependence on the US, with
nothing done in Europe for years because it was content with American trade.
He said Scotland had to grasp the opportunities now because ``a window of
opportunity is going  to close in five to 10 years time''.
Although Scotland at least had a presence in Germany, unlike the rest of the UK
which relied on part-time consultants, Mr Scrimgeour wants more people on the
ground to ensure the advantage was maintained.
He said: ``If we can get a decent number of Germany companies into Scotland,
and get Germans to use Scottish suppliers, then we will have a base in five
years' time to cushion us against the inevitable outcome of the way the
European economy is developing.''

<HEADLINE>Charity attacks sports shoe firms</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975061067</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING British charity has criticised top-brand sports shoe companies for
the way they treat workers in factories in the Far East.
Christian Aid says that while the firms spend millions of pounds endorsing
sports stars, they are short-changing the people who make the products.
In a 28-page document, released today, the charity highlights the poor
treatment suffered by workers making shoes for the five UK market leaders -
Nike, Reebok, Puma, Hi-Tec, and Adidas - and urges them to increase wages and
improve factory conditions.
Adidas recently paid Rangers star Paul Gascoigne #2m to wear its boots and
tennis star Andre Agassi has signed a clothing contract with Nike worth #70m.
Liverpool Football Club is understood to have lined up a #25m deal with Reebok.
That sum, claims the report, would more than double the wages of the 40,000
workers in China and the Philippines who make the company's trainers.
The report, The Globe-Trotting Sports Shoe, has been written by Bethan Brookes
and Peter Madden who say: ``A typical pair of trainers sells for #50 in
Britain. But the 40 or so factory workers in the Philippines who make them will
share just over #1 of that price between them. Billions are spent instead on
marketing and product endorsement.''
The leading sports shoe companies contract out the production of the vast
majority of their shoes to manufacturers in the Third World, particularly Asia.
Shoe manufacturing generates valuable jobs and money for these countries, but
wages and working conditions often leave a lot to be desired, says the report.
Among the abuses highlighted are enforced overtime, health and safety
deficiencies, discrimination against trade unions and the use of hire-and-fire
policies to avoid paying fringe benefits.
Christian Aid is asking supporters to write to the five companies urging them
to increase wages and implement a code of practice.
Mr Madden said: ``As a result we might see one advertisement fewer a week or a
top sports personality given a few thousand pounds less. Is this such a big
price to pay?''

THE Maid of the Loch will today set course for its sailing return to Loch
Lomond.
Dumbarton civic leaders will hand over ownership of the 42-year-old paddle
steamer to the trust set up to restore the steamer - three years to the day
that the district council saved her from the wrecker's yard.
Bad habit
THE Vatican has cracked down on priests who have got into the habit of not
wearing their clerical garb. But according to the Scottish Catholic Observer,
it is a rule which will be strongly resisted by many priests who enjoy wearing
civvies.
Crash shock
A COUPLE caught in a traffic jam found it had been caused by a head-on
collision involving their own daughter, who is fighting for her life in
hospital. The 25-year-old woman - who has not been named - had driven ahead of
her parents as they travelled to their Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, home after a
day out.
Woman killed
A 75-year-old woman died in hospital yesterday after an accident involving a
police van which was answering an emergency call. The woman pedestrian, who has
not been identified, received multiple injuries in the incident on Saturday in
Guildford, Surrey.
Policeman dies
AN off-duty policeman died in a stabbing attack early yesterday in Killyleagh,
County Down, during a row at a house. A man was later arrested and questioned
in connection with the death of the 36-year-old RUC officer.
Murder charge
A 51-year-old man has been charged with murdering his wife after her body was
found at their home. Jack Smith, of Grosvenor Road, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire,
will appear at Peterborough magistrates court today.
Death probe
A MURDER inquiry was launched yesterday after the bodies of a man and a woman
were found in a smoke-filled house in the village of Carleton, North Yorkshire.
Neighbours named the woman as 41-year-old Pauline Akrigg.
Man accused
A 23-year-old man was yesterday charged with a pensioner's murder. Maurice
Hoyle, 69, was found dead at his home in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, on
Thursday. A 19-year-old man and a woman in her early 20s are still being
questioned about Mr Hoyle's death.
Snow warning
A BITTERLY cold weather front from Siberia will sweep across Britain this week
bringing sleet and snow, forecasters said yesterday. In sharp contrast, autumn
1995 was the mildest this century and the fifth warmest since records began
more than three hundred years ago.
Money-spinner
A COUPLE who run a filling station at Tomatin, Inverness-shire, near the A9
have come up with a bizarre way of raising cash for charity. Alistar and Jean
MacRae have amassed a mountain of wheel-trims which have fallen off vehicles on
the busy Perth-to-Inverness road. They sell them at #2 each, and all the
proceeds go the Highland Hospice in Inverness.
Take the Lot
TEEN heart-throbs Take That swept the board at the Smash Hits Poll Winners
Party yesterday. They took eight top awards.
Four in court
THREE men and a woman have appeared before a special sitting of Berwick
Magistrates Court charged with supplying drugs. Paul Townsley, 37, of St
Georges Road, was remanded in custody for six days, while Shirley Pontin, 39,
also of St Georges Road, Cecil Bloomfield, 35, of St Aidans Road, and Neil
Pattinson, 28, of The Oval, all Berwick, were released on bail.

IN a key week for pay bargaining, Vauxhall unions will seek to improve on a
3.5% offer against a background of sanctions due to begin on Wednesday, and
leaders of more than a million local authority workers open negotiations on a
``substantial'' wage demand, including the introduction of a minimum wage of
#4.15 an hour.
Ford's 22,000 manual workers are currently being consulted on their ``final''
offer of a two-year package worth at least 9.25%, and, depending on the outcome
of these soundings, may yet be balloted on industrial action.
Workers at the Dagenham plant in Essex have come down against the offer while
their colleagues at Halewood on Merseyside and Bridgend in South Wales are
thought to favour acceptance.
Vauxhall's 9000 employees will be expecting their offer - of 3.5% this year and
the rate of inflation next year - to be improved to something nearer the Ford
formula of 4.75% this year and 4.5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is the
greater, next.
Neither of the two US-owned car giants is prepared to concede a union demand
for a two-hour reduction in the 39-hour working week, and both are gambling
that their UK employees will not resort to strike action even though their
German counterparts get more money for a 35-hour week.
With the Government recently confirming new spending limits which will leave
councils #3000m short of requirements, it is the local authority claim, which
it is estimated would add some 6% to the #9000m pay bill, that poses the
greatest problems for councils, the Government and the Opposition.
If met, it would put some 500,000 mainly part-time women workers on a new rate
of at least #4.15 an hour and cost some #630m, which employers say could equate
to the loss of 43,000. It would also mean a rise of 6.9% for white-collar
workers.
Mr Keith Sonnet, Unison's head of local government, said: ``We are a rich
country and it is a disgrace that we have nearly half a million local
government workers earning less than #4.15 an hour.
``Our members are sick and tired of having their pay and jobs cut and we will
campaign to make sure they get a proper settlement next year.'' Potential
embarrassment for Labour comes from the fact that, although it is committed to
the introduction of a national minimum wage, when in power it has shied away
from figures and studiously refused to support #4.15 an hour, which would lift
the pay of some low-paid workers by #17 a week.

SCOTLAND's universities are too parochial and fail to exploit breakthroughs in
computer software, says the Scottish Software Federation.
The federation is to publish a national strategy to develop Scotland's software
industry later this month by the Scottish Software Federation.
Federation director Tom McCallum said that while Scottish universities produced
one of the highest percentages of computer graduates in the world, talent was
being lost abroad. The universities may have to pool their resources, in the
form of a central technology park for software companies, to make the most of
technological advances, he said.
Meanwhile, representatives of 10 software and specialist companies from the US
arrived in Scotland on the weekend to seek out trade partnerships.
It is the first software inward mission of its kind, and is expected to
generate more than #1m worth of business.
Scottish Enterprise, organisers of the trip, see it as a two-way operation.
Although the majority of the American companies are seeking partners to market
and support their products and services in Europe, some of the companies will
also be keen to find Scottish products for the US market.
The companies include PSI International, which has developed software to help
Government agencies build up databases for contraband detection, and
Interamerica Technologies, which is keen to market child-care management
software for education and social work departments.

LABOUR Party activists in Scotland were urged yesterday to make an
unprecedented effort to increase party support by winning six key seats at the
next General Election.
Addressing a party conference on local government in Dundee, assistant general
secretary Tommy Sheppard named them as Aberdeen North and Aberdeen South, whose
boundaries have been completely redrawn, Ayr, Dumfries and Stirling, held by
the Tories, and Inverness, held by the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
Asked by one delegate why Edinburgh Pentlands, the seat of Tory Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, was not on the list, Mr Sheppard said Labour
believed it would win the priority six seats before getting to Pentlands, but
they could well get to Pentlands and beyond.
A 6% swing would be needed to win Dumfries, where Sir Hector Monro was
retiring, said Mr Sheppard. In Inverness he believed the contest would boil
down to a fight between Labour and the SNP.
The six Scottish seats are part of a list of 70 drawn up by Labour Party
organisers throughout Britain.
Mr Sheppard said the party planned to make contact with 80% of the electorate
in the six key seats over the next 12 months.
With two official inquiries being held into the alleged behaviour of Labour
councillors, first in Monklands and soon in new North Lanarkshire, Tory
Ministers have also launched a series of recent attacks on Labour claiming a
``jobs for the boys'' approach by some councils over senior appointments.
They have also alleged too many highly-paid officials were being appointed, and
committees structures were being expanded to allow widespread payment of
responsibility allowances.
Mr Sheppard warned Labour councillors that the run-up to the General Election
would not be a good time to become involved in any ``new controversial
initiatives'' which might incur bad publicity.
Labour controlled 21 out of the 29 new mainland councils and it must try to
avoid any bad stories appearing about Labour-run local authorities.
Speaking on Saturday, Convention of Scottish Local Authorities' president
Rosemary McKenna told the conference that Government Ministers had been telling
lies about the structures of the new authorities.
Despite Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's claims that he was giving powers
back to local government, she said, he had no intention of returning control of
water services to local government.
Rounding up the conference yesterday, new Labour Chief Whip Donald Dewar
described the Scottish Secretary as a Minister who was ``out of touch, out of
time and out of line'' and prepared to do damage to the good government of
Scotland for party advantage.
The Scottish Secretary's ``devolution'' plans with regard to the Scottish Grand
Committee were ``a confidence trick and sleight of hand'', added Mr Dewar.

A 26-YEAR-old woman was found dead in her cell at Cornton Vale prison, Stirling
last night, the third such death at Scotland's only female prison this year.
It is believed that Joanne O'Reilly, from Nitshill in Glasgow, hanged herself.
In a short statement the Scottish Prison Service said the untried prisoner was
found shortly after 8pm in Romeo Block by staff. She had been on remand at the
prison since November 30.
This latest discovery will fuel calls for reform to the way vulnerable, untried
prisoners are dealt with by the system.
A fatal accident inquiry is already under way into the deaths of Arlene Elliot
and Kelly Holland, both 17, in separate incidents at the prison earlier this
year.
The Scottish system was heavily criticised by the Howard League for Penal
Reform, earlier this year, for remanding teenage girls. Such decisions were
described as ``archaic''.
However, the regime at Cornton Vale, which is also a young offenders'
institution, is regarded as relatively relaxed. It holds 168 people, and the
death of Joanne O'Reilly brings the total to three deaths in ten years.
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said: ``The police and next of kin
have been informed and a fatal accident inquiry will be held in due course.
Until then we cannot comment further.'' He said he was unable to disclose why
she had been remanded.
Cornton Vale was criticised in June by Mr Clive Fairweather, chief inspector
with the Prisons Inspectorate for Scotland. Following a three-day inspection,
he said: ``The regime needs to be improved. Staff are carrying out their
statutory duties and little else.''

THE British Medical Association has called for the drink-driving limit to be
almost halved, echoing similar demands from Scottish police last week.
The BMA has written to Transport Secretary Sir George Young calling for the
reduction of the alcohol limit from 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of
blood to 50 milligrammes and the introduction of random breath-testing.
The BMA in Scotland said the long-term aim was to ban drinking and driving
completely.
Last week, Mr William Spence, traffic chairman of the Association of Police
Officers in Scotland and Chief Constable of Tayside Police marked the launch of
the 10th annual festive season campaign with a call to reduce the level to 50
milligrammes.
This would bring Britain in line with other European countries and greatly
reduce the risk of accidents, the BMA said.
The request was made jointly with the Parliamentary Advisory Council for
Transport Safety (Pacts), a cross-party road safety pressure group.
In their letter, the BMA and Pacts say: ``Research evidence indicates that the
relative risk of driver involvement in road traffic accidents is increased
significantly at a blood alcohol level of 50mg/100ml.''
The letter argues that tougher enforcement, including random breath-testing,
would be needed if a lower drink limit was to be effective.
BMA Scottish secretary Dr Brian Potter said that, ideally, drivers should not
be allowed to drink at all. But he added that such a move had to be phased in
gradually.
Campaigners have stressed that alcohol limits vary from person to person. But
the proposed reduction would be amount to approximately one pint of ordinary
lager, two glasses of wine or a double whisky for a man of average weight and
build.
Scottish Roads and Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton has said that
drink-driving legislation is under review but there are no current plans to
change the legal limit.
The Government is due to launch a #1m Christmas anti-drink drive campaign this
week targeted at young people.
The terrible effect of alcohol-related accidents, not just on young drivers,
but also on their friends, is the main theme of the campaign.
A powerful TV commercial will show that although a young drink-driver may not
be too concerned what happens to him, he does become upset about the effects on
his friends.
The commercial will be shown for the first time tomorrow.
Meanwhile, a survey out today shows that more than half of motorists do not
know how much alcohol they can drink before they pass the legal drink-drive
limit.
Drivers' responses were so muddled that it would be safer if they left the car
at home when drinking, the survey organisers said.
The survey, by insurers Eagle Star, showed that:
q.Almost six out of 10 drivers (57%) did not know the legal drink-drive limit.
q.Nearly 66% wrongly believed that a pint of lager and a single brandy
contained the same amount of alcohol (the lager has twice as much alcohol).
q.One in 10 motorists wrongly believed a woman could drink three glasses of
wine and stay under the limit.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has admitted Scotland could be independent
in seven years' time.
His remarks were an attempt to warn of the dangers, as he saw them, of Labour's
devolution plans, but were seized upon by the Scottish National Party which
said it showed even opponents were accepting independence was a real
possibility in the near future.
In effect, Mr Forsyth was saying that if Labour won the next election and
introduced a Scottish Parliament, it could lead to a majority of Scots voting
for independence at the following General Election, which could be in 2002.
Questioned by interviewer Alastair Stewart on GMTV's The Sunday Programme, Mr
Forsyth blamed what he called Labour's grossly irresponsible devolution plans
for what could be the probable break-up of the United Kingdom.
He said: ``At the moment our battle is to prevent Labour creating a change
which may be irreversible and which, in my view, would actually lead to the
break-up of the UK. It may be that by 2002 we'll be looking at an independent
Scotland.''
He added: ``Two years ago I would never have thought that possible. But such
has been the gross irresponsibility of Labour over these proposals that they
are creating a situation where we could sleepwalk into separatism.''
Conservative politicians have said in the past that devolution could ultimately
lead to full independence. However, this is the first time that anyone as
senior as a Cabinet Minister has suggested it could happen so quickly.
Mr Forsyth also candidly accepted that if Labour won the election, and
established a Scottish Parliament, the Tories would nevertheless not boycott it
and would field candidates. Although this is to be expected, it is not normal
for a senior politician to discuss what would happen if his or her party lost
the next election.
His openness was quickly exploited by SNP leader Alex Salmond, who pointed out:
``Michael Forsyth and John Major claim that if there is devolution,
independence will follow in double-quick time. George Robertson and Tony Blair
say that if there is no devolution, independence will follow.
``It seems that even our political opponents are agreed about Scotland's
destination, and the political argument is merely about the route by which we
get there.''
Mr Forsyth's strategy is to convince voters that Labour's proposals are far
more dangerous to the future of the UK than people realise. If successful, it
could just convince wavering Tory supporters to stick with the party.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was quick to attack Mr Forsyth's
claims. ``It's an insult to the intelligence of the Scottish people to assume
that just by creating a Scottish Parliament that will make them want
independence more,'' he said.
Labour, however, will be unhappy at the Secretary of State making such an issue
of independence. It had hoped to marginalise the SNP by making the next
election as far as possible a straight fight between the Government and Labour.
Mr Forsyth's remarks will ensure that the independence issue will continue to
be a major election issue in Scotland.

Paris
FRANCE'S week-long public sector strike against government plans to reform the
welfare system looks set to spread.
The leaders of two major unions have called on their members in the private
sector to stop work.
Mr Marc Blondel, leader of Force Ouvriere, appealed to private sector workers
to demand the repeal of Prime Minister Alain Juppe's schemes.
``I am now going to ask all sectors to progressively join in the strike, with
one single goal: the withdrawal of the Juppe plan,'' Mr Blondel said.
He was supported yesterday by Mr Louis Viannet of the Communist sympathising
CGT.
Despite these warnings, President Jacques Chirac yesterday reaffirmed support
for the reforms.
``It is this path, the path of reforms too long delayed, that I have chosen,''
Mr Chirac said, breaking his silence on the issue during a summit of
French-speaking nations in Benin, in Africa.
The government wants to raise taxes, control health spending, reform
universities and tighten retirement packages for public employees to cut state
deficits enough for France to qualify for a single European currency from 1999.
Workers fear the cuts will trim their health or retirement benefits and lead to
state layoffs.
Members of the RPR Gaullist party were hard at work yesterday setting up
``users' committees'' to protest against the strikes and organise a counter
demonstration on the Champs Elysees in Paris on Thursday.
Mr Juppe called an emergency meeting of members of his government whose
ministries are directly concerned by the strike. A statement afterwards gave no
indication that he was prepared to give an inch.
Representatives of students, who have been on strike for a month throughout the
country to protest at under-funding and too few teachers, finally had a
two-hour meeting with Education Minister Francois Bayrou.
After refusing to shake the Minister's hand, the students, from Trotskyist and
socialist organisations, proposed a #7000m plan spread over the next five
years. Mr Bayrou offered a #400m emergency fund, and the recruitment of 4000
teachers and employees. The students rejected the move.
The economic cost of the strike, meanwhile, is beginning to bite.
Numerous small firms, especially in the Paris region, deprived of deliveries
and of their staff, are complaining of huge and crippling losses.
France's train system, at a
standstill for eight days, is suffering daily losses of more than #12m.
Many of the 8,000,000 living in the Paris region, hit by a complete stoppage of
suburban trains, metros and buses, are failing to turn up for work or working
fewer hours.
The streets of Paris have been turned into a permanent traffic jam, and
stoppages on roads leading into the capital take several hours to clear during
morning and evening rush hours.
Travel agents said the tourist industry had lost #200m over the past week.
Inland Revenue employees are due to stop work tomorrow while gas and
electricity board workers are to continue their strike action. Strikes were
also rumoured in hospitals.
Primary school teachers and workers at both Air France and Air Inter, the
domestic French airline, will stop work on Thursday.
Private coach companies have already scheduled hundreds of supplementary daily
trips between Paris and major French towns. Yesterday, the company running the
bateaux mouche, the tourist cruise boats on the Seine, announced they were
planning a regular ferry service, free of charge, up and down the river.
Many Paris hotels have announced cut-price accommodation for people living out
of town who are finding it impossible to commute to work.
Around 3000 people demonstrated in the centre of Paris on Saturday against the
strikes, demanding the government introduce a minimum service on public
transport.
Despite efforts by the RPR Gaullist party to stir up demonstrations against the
transport stoppages, a poll published over the weekend showed that more than
60% of French people sympathise with the strikers and their aims.

THE Prime Minister was called on yesterday to intervene and reverse possible
job cuts at a Scottish research unit where scientists are looking for links
between ``mad cow'' disease and its equivalent form in humans.
Shadow Agriculture Minister Dr Gavin Strang described threatened redundancies
at the Neuro-Pathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh as a result of Government grant
reductions as a national scandal.
His call came on the same day as Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell insisted that
there was ``no conceivable risk'' of people becoming infected with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) from eating beef.
Dr Strang has written to Mr Major, expressing shock that cuts could be made
when there was increasing concern over Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE).
He said the scientists in Edinburgh were told two weeks ago of the decision by
the Government-backed Institute for Animal Health, of which the unit is a part,
that they had until December 21 to find enough volunteers for redundancy or
face compulsory job cuts.
The institute is axing between 50 and 70 posts - about 10% of the workforce -
at its laboratories in Edinburgh, Surrey and Berkshire.
The NPU in Scotland is involved in developing detailed tests to identify the
agent that causes BSE in cattle and its human equivalent, CJD. There has been
growing concern about a possible link.
Institute director Professor John Bourne said that in the past he had protected
the BSE programme from the effects of cuts, but in the face of a further
#500,000 grant cut by the Ministry of Agriculture that might no longer be
possible.
Last week, leading brain surgeon Professor Sir Bernard Tomlinson called for a
ban on sales of beef offal because of concerns, and revealed he had given up
beefburgers and meat pies.
Mr Dorrell told LWT's Dimbleby programme that the scientific evidence suggested
that BSE could not be transmitted through the food chain.
Under new Government regulations brought in last week, the only organs that
could possibly be linked with the disease, the brain and the spinal cord, had
now been banned from shops.
Unlike Sir Bernard, Mr Dorrell said that he was still prepared to eat
hamburgers and to give them to his own children. The Government's Chief Medical
Officer would do the same, he said.
A Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman said that overall Government funding for
research into BSE was set to rise by #1m next year to #6.4m.

TWO Cabinet Ministers have conceded that the Conservatives may not be able to
bring taxes back down to 1992 levels before the next election.
Party chairman Brian Mawhinney admitted this in an interview on BBC-TV's On The
Record, but said he believed the Tories could still be re-elected. The British
people realised, he said, that Conservatives were ``instinctive'' tax-cutters
and Labour were not.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke put himself on a collision course with right-wing
Tory MPs when he indicated that tax cuts in his next Budget - the last before a
General Election - might not be bigger than those in last week's.
He said: ``We won't win the next election if we are perceived to be bribing the
electorate. We will win the election if we are seen to be running the economy
competently.''
Mr Clarke also risked right-wing wrath by describing those who wanted major
cutbacks in welfare spending to be ``living in cloud cuckooland''.
Dr Mawhinney insisted that a family on average earnings would be #9 a week
better off next year because of the combination of Budget tax cuts and higher
pay.
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott said that that assumed 4% pay rises, above
the expected inflation rate, something the Government had discouraged in the
public sector.
Mr Michael Heseltine strongly defended the Chancellor against criticism among
some Tory MPs that the Budget had proved a flop in winning back voters for the
Conservatives.
The Deputy Prime Minister said of Mr Clarke: ``He is a rock of a Chancellor and
he knows exactly what he's doing.'' The Budget, he said, would be better
received by voters as they began to feel the benefits of its provisions.
But some Tory MPs, after testing opinion in their constituencies, have begun
voicing their discontent.
They received support from an NOP poll for the Sunday Times taken after the
Budget statement showing that Labour had actually increased its lead by four
points since the previous survey.
Even more woundingly for the Chancellor, the percentage of people who say they
trust the Tories on taxation has fallen 3% since a fortnight before, and now
stands at 26%.
Mr David Evans, MP for Welwyn and Hatfield and a member of the executive of the
1922 Committee of Tory back benchers, said: ``Ken Clarke has no nose for
politics. He may be robust but when it comes to knowing what people want he is
lacking.
``The trouble is that if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing
nobody.''
Sir Rhodes Boyson, MP for Brent North, another member of the 1922 executive,
said: ``I am disappointed that there haven't been bigger cuts in public
spending which would allow a greater reduction in both direct and indirect
taxation.''
The Chancellor may be forced to make a concession during Commons discussion of
the Finance Bill, implementing the Budget, by allowing the new threshold of
#200,000 for the payment of death duties to apply at once instead of next April.
Several Tory MPs are urging this. Mr Tom Smith (Beconsfield), said: ``When
people hear a Budget announcement of this kind they naturally assume that it
will take effect immediately.
``It is then very upsetting to discover that this is not the case and that
one's liability for inheritance tax will depend on the date of one's death.''
A Cabinet battle is looming on the future of child benefit, which the
Government has been obliged by its 1992 election manifesto commitment to keep.
Some Ministers, like Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, favour abolishing
it and giving parents more generous tax allowances.
In contrast to these expected strains, Mr Heseltine lavished praise on the
Prime Minister who, he said, had been ``extremely generous to me''. He added:
``He might not be the most flamboyant this country has had but he will prove to
be one of the most successful.''

A SCOTTISH prison, which up until four years ago housed the infamous ``Cages''
holding some of the country's most notorious and dangerous criminals, is to
receive a UK-wide award for facility improvements and high staff standards.
HM Prison Porterfield, Inverness, is one of 20 Scots winners of so-called
``Oscars of public service''.
A record 223 such services will be presented by the Prime Minister with the
1995 Charter Mark at a ceremony in London today.
Built in 1902, Porterfield was designed to hold 79 prisoners but recent
alterations have increased capacity to 107.
Refurbishment of the segregation unit known as the ``Cages'', mothballed since
1991, has created accommodation and activities areas for up to 12 vulnerable
prisoners.
Other measures including conversion of the slopping-out area has helped ease
overcrowding. Among other winners is Glasgow's Anniesland College which becomes
the first further education college in Strathclyde to gain the award. It is
recognised for its delivery of services to customers, especially its students.
Motherwell District Council Housing gains recognition, as does the national
housing agency, Scottish Homes.
The National Museums of Scotland becomes the first museums group in Scotland to
receive the Charter Mark, while, in the medical field, recipients are the Royal
Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust, Dunfermline's Queen Margaret Hospital, and
the Victoria Infirmary NHS Trust Cardiac Rehabilitation Centre.
Central Scotland Police wins an award and the Scottish Police College at
Tulliallan, the national centre for police Training in Scotland, is another
recipent.
Annandale and Eskdale District Council Parks Section and West Lothian District
Council Pest Control Service also gain the Mark.
Three Benefits Agency Districts - East Lowlands, Fife and Highlands and Islands
- win the award as do Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
The ceremony took place at the Queen Elizabeth 11 Centre in Westminster.
Three London councils dubbed ``loony left'' by the Tories - Haringey, Islington
and Southwark - also win awards.

Brussels
THE EU's auditors have concluded that ``illegal and irregular'' methods were
used in the successful French dirty-tricks campaign to keep Strasbourg as the
permanent home of the European Parliament at a cost of millions of pounds.
Their report - circulated privately to Euro-MPs last week - condemns the
decision by Mr Egon Klepsch, former president of the parliament, to sign a
contract last year which allowed work to start while the assembly's independent
financial controller was strongly advising against the move.
Work is now advanced on the building which will replace the existing assembly
at what the report says is a ``provisional'' cost to the European taxpayer of
#354m.
This is despite strong hostility from most non-French Euro-MPs who grumble at
having to travel every month to Strasbourg.
Last night, Mr David Martin, Labour Euro-MP for Lothians, condemned the methods
used by the French to force through the decision. Mr Martin, a vice-president
of the parliament, was one of two British Euro-MPs in the executive bureau of
the assembly to vote against. The other was Tory Sir Jack Stewart-Clark.
Mr Martin said: ``It seems now that very little can be done. The whole thing is
a disgrace, all brought on by pressure from the French government. The European
Parliament bureau gave approval to this project in a way which no commercial
company would have touched.''
Work is also nearing completion on another #800m parliamentary complex in
Brussels to replace its existing offices. The parliament also has seldom-used
buildings in Luxembourg. The French have fought a long and bitter battle to
keep the assembly in Strasbourg despite claims by British Euro-MPs that the
extra cost to the European taxpayer is as much as #50m a year.
The site, close to the Rhine, was chosen as a symbol of post-war reconciliation
by the EU. But most Euro-MPs resent having to travel there monthly from all
over Europe on flights which are often late and indirect and where hotel rooms
are scarce and expensive.
In a deft piece of negotiation at the Edinburgh summit in 1992, former
president Francois Mitterrand managed to get the Strasbourg deal past John
Major when the prime minister was chairing a session struggling to reach an
accord on other issues.
The auditors' report is a draft submitted to the parliament for its response.
The auditors said they wanted to know why a long lease was signed on March 31
last year without the approval of the parliament's financial controller, Mr
Eoghan O'Hannrachain.
The auditors note that three days before the contract was signed by Mr Klepsch,
the financial controller had ``concluded explicitly that in the absence of
substantial modifications the draft contract should not be signed in its
current form.''
The auditors also expressed ``serious reservations'' at the price agreed for
the land (#17m) which they said they held to be too high.
The 26-page draft concludes that the rules governing the contract and the
principles of sound financial management ``were not observed, in particular as
regards the sound functioning of internal control''.
It concludes: ``Because it has signed the contract, the parliament is bound to
make out the future payments related to the construction of the Strasbourg
hemicycle. This does not mean that, at an internal level, the parliament should
not be required to remedy the situations of illegality and irregularity that
have been found in respect of the signing of the contract in question.''

LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland yesterday rejected a call from
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble to make the first move in giving up arms.
Mr Trimble said it ``would deprive the IRA of any possible scintilla of
objection to handing over their own weapons'', but both the UVF and UFF
organisations made clear that they would not move until the IRA did.
Mr Trimble, who is to have talks today with SDLP leader John Hume, said he had
hoped to encourage loyalists to begin a decommissioning process early next year
before US Senator George Mitchell's international arms commission finished a
report on illegal guns which is part of the Government's twin-track approach on
Northern Ireland.
Democratic Unionist councillor Gary McMichael said: ``There is no question of
any sort of physical gesture ahead of the IRA while the Provos remain
operational and at full capacity.''
British Government spokesmen also rejected suggestions that Ministers were
ready to allow all-party talks to start on an understanding that paramilitary
weapons would be handed in on a phased basis as the talks continued.
A Northern Ireland Office spokeswoman said the Prime Minister had made clear
that the process of decommissioning illegally-held arms must have started
before substantive political negotiations could begin.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the IRA would co-operate with the peace
process, but Mr Major knew that they would not give up weapons until there was
a political settlement.
The province's political leaders are now studying the formal invitation they
have had from the Government to take part in preparatory talks paving the way
for all-party negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.
These need not and will not involve all the parties talking together. Their
representatives can hold discussions separately with the British and Irish
governments if they wish.
British Government sources were stressing that, although labelled preparatory,
the talks were highly important for creating an agreed basis on which
negotiations could begin.
Mr Trimble said again at the weekend that decommissioning would have to start
before his party would consider sitting down with Sinn Fein.
The two governments could also be moving towards approving a decision by London
to call elections for a Northern Ireland assembly, after which the elected
representatives could put the views of their parties at round table
constitutional talks.
The idea is backed by Labour. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said
it could provide an ``election passport'' into the talks. British Ministers
might also welcome an election likely to show Sinn Fein's popular support in
the Province to be around the 15% mark putting their spokesmen's claims in
perspective.
The Prime Minister is likely to be asked about the next step forward in the
peace process when he answers questions in the Commons tomorrow.
Mr Adams said yesterday that a new phase of the peace process had started
following the Downing Street agreement and President Clinton's visit.
He added: ``How far that will take us remains to be seen. We will be
proactively seeking to make it work. The test of any twin-track process is its
ability to remove all preconditions. Unless they are removed, it's useless.''
Mr Adams said that he wanted all guns, including those held by police and
troops, removed.
``Not as a precondition, but as a necessary objective. We want to see
demilitarisation.''
But Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said that, when it came to
decommissioning, there had to be ``different formulations'' for dealing with
paramilitary weapons and the legally-held arms of the security forces.
``Sinn Fein never expected that the British Army would march up to the Falls
Road park, stash their weapons and we'd have a huge bonfire - any more than we
expected that was how we would deal with the IRA weapons,'' he said.

THERE was a time, really, when amateur football counted quite a lot. You used
to get stamps from Romania and the Georgian Republic with football players
because Eastern Europe had nothing but amateur teams. The great Hungarian side
which thrashed England consisted of amateur players, and I don't think.
For many years amateur footy players were close to professionals. After all,
there wasn't much difference in the pay. Twenty quid was the limit for pros:
Stanley Matthews played until he was more than 50 and earned sod-all except a
knighthood. The last professional team in the world which continues to be
amateur, and non-paying, is a team I indeed played for, many, many, years ago,
Queen's Park. To this day it pays sod-all.
Amateur football is a bit of a contradiction. Every footy player who plays for
nothing wants to play for a lot of it. Junior football has lots of players who
are quite good but who want to be a lot better and get paid handsomely for
thumping opponents. The referee does not get paid at all, save expenses. Thus
we had in Stirling on Saturday the sight of amateur teams Cambusbarron Rovers
and St Ninians Thistle wrestling with each other in the drizzle, glaur, mud,
and glamour of a second-round tie in the Scottish Amateur Cup.
Cambusbarron have won copiously for the last three years. St Ninians, promoted
by local publican George Wilson of the Borestone Bar, not a kick in the arse
aff Bannockburn, have won little other than support from the locals.
The locals included David Reynolds, a worthy player last year who broke a leg
and can give you as good a reason why amateur footy costs in a way that
professional athleticism does not. There was no insurance for David. There is
no insurance for anybody involved in serious commitment to real sport.
Norrie Lean, a seasoned supporter and former manager of St Ninians, is an
ex-miner, from Fallin Pit, a big lad, now out of work, like many others in
industrial Scotland. But yet he was there at the football.
There are still supporters of football and communities. Jim McGurk, a lorry
driver, he's there, supporting amateur football: I don't know why. Amateur has
reformed itself; came essentially from the Sunday Leagues, the matches I played
in myself for many years. It might be amateur but it is expensive. Saturday's
game cost 20 quid for the park, a wet cockpit of green sward, #20 for the
referee, #25 for strips washed, league fees #30 per month, match balls #40
every time. (Matches are meant to have a new ball every game: that'll be
right). Few amateur players are under 25, some more than 40.
In fact, Cambusbarron were expected to win because they were older. They
didn't. Cambusbarron got two goals from their lad Pincombe but it wasn't
enough. St Ninian Thistle scored three, with Les Moir scoring the winner, and
him missing an early penalty, and Johnny Symons scoring the two others, though
Johnstone Kennedy made a claim on a goal. I wouldn't know myself.
You have to be in the middle of Stirling through a glass darkly to get the full
flavour of amateur football, or even care who scored at all. It got worse. I
discovered our sports editor's boy, Alasdair, at the game. He is 14 and should
have more sense than his dad. At least his team won and the boy was too young
to get me a drink in the Borestone. Alasdair has a twin called Iain. Their dad
calls them the Krays because, though fond of the little lads, he imagines they
are rougher than Stirling neds. But Stirling is not rough at all: it is a
lovely little place, apart from the language. You think I can swear?
Back in the Borestone Bar: never saw so many bottles of malt - more than 950
separate bottles of single malts. Sponsor George Wilson is introducing me to
Tony Crawford and George Kind. They are elderly gentlemen who hailed originally
from Poland and are dressed like George Sanders in a 1950s British movie, and
they changed their names so that Scots could understand them. The referee is
having a dram.
Cambusbarron won the amateur league in 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1977. They lost on
Saturday to St Ninians. I have little idea how I got home, except that my
sports editor's boy got me a taxi.

THE videos detailing the footballing life and times of John Greig are subtitled
``The Legend''. The question that immediately sprang to mind was: ``The end of
whose broken leg are we talking about?''
One of the few Greig jokes not included is the one which involves a phone call
to his wife to inform her that he has suffered a bad injury. ``I'm afraid John
will be coming home with a broken leg,'' says the Ibrox official. ``Whose leg
is it?'' asks Mrs Greig.
Indeed, when I heard that the Greig story was coming out in two videos, I
assumed that Part 1 was his life story and Part 2 was a collection of his
greatest fouls. The great man himself adds fuel to this reputation when he
relates the story of Willie Waddell's team talk before the Cup-Winners Cup
semi-final in 1972 against Torino.
The Italian No.10 was the danger man, said Waddell. He told Greig to ``put him
oot the game''. ``Jist for the night, boss, or for good?'' Greig replied.
In fact, in the two hours of watching in the videos of the John Greig Story, we
get a glimpse of only one foul, delivered to a Moscow Dynamo player in the
first seconds of the Cup-Winners Cup final in Barcelona in 1972.
As Alex MacDonald, midfield colleague of Greig's and no softie himelf, says:
``When you went out for Willie Waddell during that campaign, you would have
kicked your granny.''
Just as the victors get to write history, football videos show a cleaned-up
version of the lives of the heroes which they celebrate. A warts and all, fouls
and all, approach would be much more gripping but it would not go down at all
well with the SFA.
I would recommend the Greig video story to Celtic fans of all ages who may
regard the man as a bit of a clugger - to be reviled for the times he sent
Jimmy Johnstone or Bobby Lennox six feet into the air and to be praised
grudgingly  when, wearing a Scottish jersey, he did the same thing to Alan Ball
or Nobby Stiles.
The archive film reveals the young Greig as a skilful footballer, wrong-footing
opponents and dispatching measured passes to colleagues.
Young Greig played in a midfield with a chap called Baxter and contented
himself with playing a supporting role. But when Slim Jim was called up for
National Service and Greig took over his role on an undefeated pre-season tour
of the Soviet Union, in the words of colleague Bobby Shearer: ``Baxter wasn't
missed.''
Greig soldiered on through the dark years for Rangers when Stein was in charge
at Parkhead and came through to taste success under Willie Waddell and Jock
Wallace. The ultimate triumph at Barcelona in 1972, when Greig played with a
fractured foot, being only slightly dimmed by a huge Rangers fan falling on him
at full-time and fracturing the other foot.
Then there was the fact that the trophy had to be presented in the anonymity of
a room inside the Nou Camp because of what narrator Dougie Donnelly
diplomatically describes as ``the explosion of joy'' of the Rangers fans who
``just wanted to celebrate''.
We see Greig ending his playing career gloriously and fittingly with his 857th
game, winning a Scottish Cup medal, and completing the second treble in two
seasons. Greig would have done anything for Rangers and particularly for Willie
Waddell.
Greig tells of the much bigger demand Waddell made when he asked him to succeed
Jock Wallace as manager. Three years later, despite winning two Scottish cups
and a league title, Greig resigned, his health in ruins.
Perhaps John Greig was just too nice a man to be a football manager in these
days when those in the game seem all too eager to devour their own. The warmth
and respect shown in the video for John Greig from all his contemporaries is
immense. Not least from Celtic's Billy McNeill and Bobby Lennox, despite the
latter's somehat tattered leg-end after the attentions of Mr Greig.
q.Celtic fans who wish to re-educate themselves on the subject of Gentleman
John Greig have a chance to win my review copy of John Greig The Legend Parts 1
and 2 (Cameron Williams, #12.99 each). Simply send your name and address to Tom
Shields at the Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow, G1 1QP. I will pick the

WHEN Dundee United ran out on to Tannadice to face Dumbarton on Saturday decked
out in new colours, predominantly black, there were those among the home
support who judged the choice befitting of the general mood about the place so
far this season.
Inconsistency of performance having marred all but a few match days since
August, the overall impression of the United supporter has been one of intense
disappointment at what has been on offer.
Compare that attitude with the adulation heaped on their favourites some 90
minutes later, after a record-breaking 8-0 drubbing of strugglers Dumbarton,
and you appreciate the fickle nature of the football fan.
And if one is prepared to listen to United's scoring hero Craig Brewster, there
could yet be more afternoons of a similar nature to come from the side this
season.
After bagging a personal four-goal haul, the 28-year-old claimed: ``It just
proves that if everyone works as hard as they did in this one, anything is
possible.''
Brewster's scoring tally from limited top-team appearances this season through
injury - seven goals in just four starts - indicates his determination to hold
down the front-line recall he earned just nine days ago.
He added: ``The boss spent big money purchasing both Gary McSwegan and Owen
Coyle while I was recovering from a broken wrist, so I knew that I was going to
have to wait my turn, then grab it when it came.''
Brewster grabbed two goals in the first 15 minutes to point United in the right
direction, although the remarkable fact was that it took two great stops by
goalkeeper Ally Maxwell     to deny the visitors a shock lead.
However, once Grant Johnson added to the home lead five minutes from the
interval, the contest was over. The second half was best forgotten by the Sons
as Brewster struck in another superb double, Martin Melvin nodded one into his
own net, Owen Coyle made it seven, and Gary McSwegan stepped up off the bench
to complete the scoring.
Spare a thought for Dumbarton manager Jim Fallon. He has to lead his Boghead
side along the same road and the miles to Dundee tomorrow for a rearranged
league date against the other half of the City of Discovery.
Dundee United 8,
Dumbarton 0

WESTERN CROSS COUNTRY
BETTER known as a track runner, with a sub-four-minute mile and a national
1500m title to his credit, Adrian Callan proved his worth as a cross-country
runner with his first win in the senior six-mile race at the SAF Western
District Cross-country championships at Stepps beating clubmate Graeme Wight by
12 seconds ahead of a 300-strong field.
Shettleston took the team title, but Cambuslang won all five other male team
awards. Alan Puckrin, third, led Greenock Glenpark to bronze medals in their
centenary year.
Glasgow University first-year medical student Sheila Fairweather was out on her
own when winning the women's four-mile race by more than 80 yards from veteran
Sandra Branney, with Elaine McBrinn a distant third.
Fairweather's elder sister, Clare, was 13th, while her father, David, was
runner up in the over-50 veterans' race. Results:

Hearts 0, Rangers 2
PAUL Gascoigne bowed out in some style at Tynecastle as he headed for a
two-match suspension with a second-half performance which matched the 90
minutes of magic he provided at Easter Road the previous week.
After this latest display, striker Ally McCoist revealed that no-one in the
Ibrox dressing-room had ever doubted that Gascoigne would succeed with Rangers.
While others wondered if the Englishman had lost the special skills which
earned him a #4.3m price tag in the summer, his fellow players believed in him.
Said McCoist: ``We all knew that he would be a success, we knew from the moment
he joined us for pre-season training. The way he was pushing himself back to
full fitness told the rest of us what he was all about.
``But I think too many people expected too much, too soon. If you look at the
players who have come here, then you find that they have all taken time to
settle, with just one or two exceptions.
``Brian Laudrup, for example, was an instant hit but that hasn't happened very
often. Paul has demonstrated in the past few games just what he can achieve
with the club.
``It was in the second half, when he and Brian really turned it on, that we had
our most profitable spell of the game.
``Brian did really well when he won us the penalty and then Paul scored the
second goal that settled things.
``We have had two very good results away from home but we know that Celtic are
still close behind us and that is what we expected to happen this season.
``From the start, there was this feeling that Celtic would be the team to give
us problems in the league and that is the way it's turning out.''
For McCoist himself the penalty allowed him to celebrate his 250th goal in
league football, a total which may, he joked, include three strikes from his
time with Sunderland.
At Tynecastle, the penalty arrived after Laudrup had chased a ball to the
touchline, brought it under control, then moved into the box, where Steve
Fulton brought him down.
Hearts' manager Jim Jefferies admitted: ``It was a silly challenge which Steve
made on Laudrup and it cost us. It was only after Rangers scored that they
began to play.
``Before that, we had caused them problems and the way we handled Gascoigne
worked for us until they went in front.
``We had Gary Mackay picking him up whenever he moved forward and we limited
any damage he might have caused us.
``But, after the goals, they gained confidence and it was only in the last 10
minutes that we came back at them.''
It was another satisfying display from Rangers and arriving, as it did,
back-to-back with the win over Hibs, it was an important victory.
As McCoist pointed out, Celtic are mounting a powerful challenge to the
champions and there is little margin for error.
Against Hearts, the Ibrox men survived a first half when Jefferies' men might
have gone ahead but for another memorable match from Andy Goram, who makes
goalkeeping look simple.
Goram is so consistent there is a danger that the Rangers support may take him
for granted. They should not.
Instead, they should look back at the stops he makes, the confidence he instils
in the defence, and his intelligent throw-outs, and recognise his importance.
The keeper will be called to action much more in midweek in Dortmund than he
was at Tynecastle. But Borussia, even with the class strikers they possess,
will still find it difficult to score against Goram, who is rated by his
manager Walter Smith as Britain's No.1.
This will be Rangers' last chance to salvage some pride from a Champions'
League campaign which has been so disastrous for them.
Both Richard Gough and Charlie Miller collected knocks at Tynecastle but will
be available for the game.
Indeed, only Ian Ferguson, who is injured, and the suspended Gordan Petric
won't be available for the game against the Germans, who currently top their
domestic league.
Hearts' mini-revival has come to an end after defeats from both members of the
Old Firm but there is enough graft and talent in the side to ensure that they
do not drop into the danger area in the table.
Gary Locke and Alan Johnston continue to prove that good, young players are
emerging in this country. They provide hope for the long-term future while
veterans Pasquale Bruno, Neil Berry, and John Robertson add the experience
which is required in the premier division.

ANGER over the exclusion of Scots from the British team which snatched
individual and team bronze in the Northumberland Challenge European
cross-country championships on Saturday may yet bear fruit, and the point was
driven home by a Scottish success in the open race.
Scottish skirmishing on traditional reiving territory beneath the battlements
of Alnwick Castle could help to establish a UK grand prix of up to six races
which could be the selection method for future UK teams.
Matt Frazer, secretary of both the British Athletic Federation and of the UK
cross-country commission, formally was handed a letter by Bob McSwein, convener
of the sport in Scotland.
It expressed disquiet at the exclusion of Kilbarchan's World championship
internationalist Robert Quinn from the team, demanded restructuring of
selection policy, and questioned the impartiality of coaches who chose the team.
McSwein believes UK commissioners should be among the selectors and should hold
the casting vote over the coaches' representation.
``With so many commercial interests now in the sport, coaches should not have
exclusive powers,'' he said.
However Bud Baldarro, the national coach, denied that any of the team were
looked after either by him or any other commission coach.
Frazer, who has agreed to re-examine selection before next year's event in
Belgium, said: ``I should like to see a UK grand prix of six races, with one in
Scotland. That would help promote the sport, and help with selection.''
Though Andrew Pearson's individual bronze was Britain's first men's medal in a
major championship since Tim Hutchings's world silver in 1989, it merely served
to underline Britain's inability to get it right.
With four to count, Britain had three runners in the first six, yet had to wait
until forty-second place before the team was counted home.
Absent from the UK squad were Paul Evans, Rob Denmark, Eamonn Martin, Jon
Nuttal, and Gary Staines - all world-class runners, any one of whom would have
made the difference between team bronze and gold. Britain's inability to field
its best men must be addressed before the World Championships in South Africa
next March.
Emphasising that was the presence in Eire's team of John Downes, who finished
seventeenth. Downes declared availability for Britain two years ago, but his
valid claims for inclusion in the UK team for the European track championships
were ignored, and he reverted to the Republic.
If his position on Saturday had replaced the fourth British counter (42nd) the
25-point swing would have seen Britain's total two points better than Spain,
who took team gold. ``Yes, I could have been running for Britain,'' Downes said.
Pearson produced a Hotspur performance, thrice trying to break the defending
champion, Portugal's Paulo Guerra on the final lap. However it was by just one
second that he fought off Keith Cullen who, only two months ago, was stabbed in
the chest by a mugger.
Of even greater triumph over adversity was the second place in the women's race
by Sara Wedlund of Sweden. Wedlund - with her blond hair and large-lensed
spectacles, she looks like the Milky Bar Kid - as recently as February still
suffered the effects of anorexia which almost halved her body-weight. ``I had
the problem for four years,'' she said. ``I could stand, but could hardly walk.
``This is the first year I have been able to run normally again,'' she said.
The 19-year-old Wedlund finished 15 seconds behind the winner, Annemari Sandell
of Finland. Just 18, and still eligible to defend the world junior title she
won last year, Sandell hopes to return, as she did last winter, to train with
the Kenyan team.
``They promised they would let me come back, but that was before I beat them to
win the world title,'' said Sandell.
Such a glorious recovery from death's door should be noted by several young
Scottish female athletes who are currently fighting the condition.
Scotland's exclusion from Britain's finest recent men's cross-country hour was
made the more poignant when the UK reserve, Steven Wylie, scored a runaway
success over the same course in the open race as the dusk fell on dank, bleak
afternoon.
Wylie, running his sixth race in 17 days, won by a distance from a field which
included most reserves from the 21 competing nations. His time would have
placed him seventieth overall in the 103-strong championship field, 93 seconds
ahead of the final UK team member, Carl Udall, who did, however, damage an
ankle in a fall.
The experience will cause the 24-year-old Cambuslang runner to reappraise his
excessive racing programme. Details (British names unless otherwise stated):

EDINBURGH, who failed to win any of their matches in last season's
championship, made it two wins out of two, as they comfortably defeated last
year's champions Glasgow at Neilson Park, Haddington, on Saturday.
Edinburgh opened the scoring after three minutes when for the only time in the
game the ball was flashed along the line to winger Dean Jones, who went over in
the corner.
That was the only score of what became a scrappy first half as both back
divisions thereafter ran through their repertoire of rehearsed stereotyped
moves lacking in any inspiration or spontaneity. Too often they failed to take
the ball at pace, making life easy for both defences who tackled solidly.
Too little was seen of Glasgow as an attacking force. Chris Smith did make one
good break but ran out of support, and Stuart McAllister, who looked solid at
full back, was given little opportunity to show his attacking ability.
Up front, Edinburgh's pack produced the better possession as Paul McGinley and
Stuart Tait won a lot of good lineout ball. Glasgow's Ally Smith, however, took
the only strike against the head.
Further scoring was delayed until midway in the second half. From a lineout on
the Glasgow line, a loose ball was won by Edinburgh skipper Euan Thayne who fed
Ross Balmer who went over for the try assisted by his pack. Jonny Sim added the
conversion.
Jamie Millan pulled back Glasgow with a penalty. Thereafter Sim, who made a
couple of good breaks and generally kicked well, dropped a goal and later
slotted a well angled penalty to give Edinburgh their final margin of victory.
The result leaves Glasgow looking as favourites to take the wooden spoon, while
for Edinburgh a victory next Saturday against the South will give them the
district championship.
Edinburgh - G Kinross (Preston Lodge); J McLelland (Biggar), J Davidson
(Grangemouth), J Barr (Forrester), D Jones (Ross High); J Sim (Heriot's), J
Brotherstone (Preston Lodge); P Simpson, D Harley (both Heriot's), R Balmer, P

Wimbledon 3, Newcastle 3
WIMBLEDON and Newcastle, in their markedly different ways, brought colour and
passion to a grey south London afternoon yesterday as well as delighting
television viewers all over the world with one of the season's outstanding
Premiership games.
The result was the only fair one after 90 minutes of such equally divided
possession and opportunities. It leaves Newcastle five points ahead of
Manchester United at the top of the table, beaten just once in 20 games, while
Wimbledon, deprived of their first victory in 13 attempts, nevertheless climb
out of the bottom three.
For all their stylistic differences - or perhaps because of them - these teams
have a good effect on each other. In the previous two seasons, Wimbledon had
won the fixture 4-2 and 3-2; two months ago at St James' Park it finished 6-1
to Newcastle, after Wimbledon had keeper Paul Heald sent off and had to put
Vinnie Jones between the posts.
Yesterday Jones was absent, suffering from flu, and a wonderful game flowed all
the better without his abrasive interventions. Each side kept two men wide,
with two strikers in between them, so for once there was abundant room for the
remaining midfielders to work, rather than operating in conditions more like a
rugby scrum. The flanks were used well, passes went forward rather than
backwards or sideways and, not surprisingly, goals flowed - five of them before
half-time.
There had been three near misses even before Les Ferdinand opened the scoring
for Newcastle in the eighth minute. Their former striker Mick Harford lost
possession to John Beresford, who sprinted down the left and crossed for
Ferdinand to side-foot in.
Two ripostes in three minutes midway through the half reminded Newcastle of
their opponents' famed resilience, as well as their own occasional frailty in
defence. Keeper Shaka Hislop may have been blameless when Dean Holdsworth
clipped Jon Goodman's cross past him, but he was guilty of dropping a cross and
allowing Harford to drive in a shot that Efan Ekoku may just have got a touch
on.
On the half-hour, David Ginola, disappointingly quiet for much of the match,
made his one telling contribution with a cross that invited Ferdinand to clip
in his twentieth goal of the season.
Only four more minutes and Newcastle had regained the lead, with Ferdinand this
time the provider. Muscling along the bye-line, he refused to concede
possession and Keith Gillespie just beat a lunging defender to the pass.
Kinnear's two half-time substitutions, sending on Alan Reeves into defence and
Marcus Gayle on the left, kept his charges a little tighter at the back without
weakening their attacking threat, and they deserved the final goal. Holdsworth
scored it, after Harford headed Alan Kimble's cross square for him.
For once both managers agreed about the quality of the game and the justice of
the result. ``That's probably the hardest game Newcastle have had all season,''
said Joe Kinnear. Kevin Keegan did not disagree. ``Wimbledon ask different
questions of you, and we found some of them difficult to answer,'' he said.
WIMBLEDON - Heald, Cunningham, Perry, Pearce, Kimble, Leonhardsen, Earle,
Goodman, Ekoku, Harford, Holdsworth. Substitutes - Reeves, Gayle, Segers.
NEWCASTLE - Hislop, Barton, Howey, Peacock, Beresford, Gillespie, Lee, Clark,
Ginola, Ferdinand, Beardsley. Substitutes - Watson, Albert, Srnicek.
Referee - G Ashby (Worcester).

Stirling County 33,
Boroughmuir 14
STEWART Hamilton, who has been acting as Stirling captain in Kevin McKenzie's
absence, had to miss this one because of an attack of shingles.
But after the game, cigar at the glow, he was well enough to assure me that his
merry men might well be able to score the required points against Heriot's and
thus retain the championship.
``Let's see - we need a differential of 43 points. We'll score six converted
tries and then we'll only want a penalty. Perfectly possible.''
Hammy, 40 in February, will probably bring down the curtain with a vital
dropped goal.
McKenzie, agonising in the stand too, informs me he will certainly be fit for
the big one; he hopes to make his return on Saturday.
Bill Gibson, the Stirling president, spoke a bit more realistically when he
conceded: ``It will be a bit of a tall order to take so many points off a side
as good as Heriot's. Whatever happens, I am most proud of our side.
``Defending the title was never going to be easy and we made a horrendous
start. In the second half of the campaign, they have performed tremendously.''
For long spells, they did just that against Boroughmuir. County were emphatic
winners, though they may rue sitting back on their heels in the last quarter
when the Edinburgh side scored a fine try.
In truth, though Stirling were also without Ian Jardine, it was the visitors
who missed absent friends most. Take Peter Wright, Grant Wilson, Darren George,
and Stuart Reid out of a Boroughmuir pack and the first team does not pass the
Trades Descriptions Act.
Brian Robertson and John Manson made life miserable for the Edinburgh props and
Stirling had bags of ball. Mostly they used it well.
Everyone, not least his legion of admirers and readers, was pleased to see
Kenny Logan come good with two tries. Full back is his best position - I wrote
it two months ago and have not changed my mind.
Kenny Harper had an immaculate game too, but if one were awarding a
man-of-the-match prize, it would have to go to the old lad himself, Sean
Raymond Patrick Lineen, still the best play-maker in the land. ``I need the
money - I am going on until I am 50,'' he told me when battle was o'er. No-one
will complain.
The first half provided a high standard. Mark McKenzie opened up with a penalty
goal then David Elliot broke away, supported by Gavin Flockhart and Malcolm
Norval, to create a try for Colin McRobert.
Referee Eddie Murray played advantage which allowed Stuart Thom to nip over
from a ruck for the Boroughmuir reply, Bryan Easson converting.
McKenzie kicked a penalty and dropped a goal before Logan, who had already
demonstrated his sharpness, rounded off a flashing break by Gus Turner for
County's second try.
It was our Ken taking the bows again early in the second half. Gordon Mackay,
who had just come on, made the opening and Logan's finish was as deadly as
ever. McKenzie kicked the goal.
I think Elliot scored the final home try out in the murky corner though three
players gave me different names. If it was Harper, the other main suspect,
please accept the apologies. McKenzie definitely converted.
Boroughmuir, to their credit, ran everything and were finally rewarded when
Nick Marsdon set up a try for John McKinlay which Easson converted.
At the end, the announcer, and the large crowd, paid tribute to former Scotland
wing Iwan Tukalo, playing his last league game for Boroughmuir. I add mine;
nobody came off the left foot quite like ``Tuks'' and he was a model
professional when they did not even get paid.
Stirling County - K M Logan; A C M Turner, C M Sangster, M McGrandles, C C
McRobert; M McKenzie, K G M Harper; J J Manson, R Cairney, G B Robertson, J
Brough, M Norval, D Elliot, G N Flockhart, B Ireland. Replacements - G Mackay

Easson, S Thom; S Anderson, N R B Dickson, L Graham, D G Burns, A Cadzow, J
McKinlay, F D Wallace, G Dickson. Replacements - J Davies for Graham (48), G
Hepburn for Wallace (67).
Referee - E Murray (Greenock Wanderers).
SCORERS: Stirling County - McKenzie, 2p, 2c, 1dg; Logan, 2t; McRobert, 1t;
Elliot 1t. Boroughmuir - Thom, 1t; McKinlay, 1t; Easson, 2c.
q GLASGOW officials were clearly unhappy last night after disenchanted centre
Chris Simmers defected to Edinburgh - just three days before the start of the
District Championship.
Simmers made the sudden switch after having been relegated to the Glasgow bench
to make way for Test player Ian Jardine to come into the side to face North and
Midlands at Kirkcaldy on Wednesday.
Ironically, Jardine is doubtful with a neck injury and   Simmers - who played
well in last month's victory over South African tourists Griqualand West -
would probably have played.
Glasgow still have to name a replacement.
q CARDIFF suffered their second successive home defeat in the Heineken League
first division on Saturday, Bridgend completing a double over the league
leaders with a 19-18 triumph.
Pontypridd closed the gap at the top by beating Ebbw Vale.

``IT'S all coming together,'' said a delighted Glen Stewart after having won
his first major senior cross-country title in Edinburgh on Saturday.
The Scottish senior boys' champion in 1986, ahead of one Frank McGowan, now his
Leslie Deans Racing Club team-mate, Stewart took the East district crown at the
Jack Kane Centre, Edinburgh, proving his pedigree by defeating Scottish
internationalist Dave Cavers, the Hawick farmer renowned for his ability to
``loup over the plough.''
Endurance was the keynote of the senior women's race with two British marathon
internationalists in the first three. Alison Rose held off Debbie Kilner, with
ultra specialist Trudi Thomson third. Details:

JUNIORS
MOST of the junior ``big guns'' made it through to the fourth round of the OVD
Cup following Saturday's ties. Two clubs, however, who will have to overcome
replays this week are last season's finalists, Camelon and Whitburn.
Holders Camelon travelled to meet Ayrshire second-division side Darvel and
could manage only a 3-3 draw despite Darvel being reduced to 10 men early in
the first half.
Geoff Strachan put Arbroath 1-0 ahead in the sixth minute of their game against
Whitburn with ``Oscar'' Taylor equalising with a penalty by half-time.
Largs Thistle bounced back from last week's 7-0 defeat by Auchinleck to trounce
Muirkirk 5-0 and a Milton Thompson double helped Irvine Meadow to a fine 4-1
win over Dundee Violet. Inverurie Loco Works came from behind to earn a replay
against Kilbirnie Ladeside.
A depleted Cumnock team welcomed back long-term injury victim Paul Anderson for
their all-Ayrshire tie against Beith.
Cumnock went ahead in 15 minutes when Jim McCann of Beith turned a Norman
Montgomery shot into his own net. In another setback for Beith, Peter McKenna
was stretchered off before half-time.
An Ian Dick goal in the first minute of the second half set Cumnock on their
way to a comprehensive win. Two more goals from Dick to complete his hat trick
and one from Chris Wilson gave Cumnock a 5-1 victory.
Home advantage proved decisive in Kilwinning's 1-0 victory over Kelty Hearts.
Skipper Danny Sloan, making his comeback after a lengthy suspension, scored on
the hour.
A goal either side of half-time by Darren Stewart and Paul McLean took Pollok
through against 10-man Craigmark Burntonians.
Carluke Rovers lost ex-Airdrie striker Ross Donaldson with a leg break after he
had scored a double to give them a 3-3 draw with Rosyth.
Leading 1-0 with three minutes to go, Larkhall Thistle looked set for the
fourth round. However, two late goals by Livingston's veteran striker Tom Ward
took the new town club into the next round.
Tayport could manage only a draw against a nine-man Baillieston team who had
taken the lead in 16 minutes with a Nicholson goal. Hamish McKay equalised for
Tayport in 68 minutes.
Blantyre Vics increased their lead at the top of the Reebok First Division with
a 3-0 win over Vale of Clyde.
In midweek, the junior association fined Kinloss FC #200 and banned them from
the OVD Cup for the next two seasons for failing to play their second-round
game against Dundee St Joseph's.
The draw for the fourth round of the OVD Cup, with ties due to be played on
January 20, will take place in Kilbirnie's Garnock Labour Club next Sunday
afternoon. Results:

NORTH and Midlands had almost all the pressure in their Under-18 inter-district
championship match with the South at Kinloss on Saturday.
Only numerous, basic mistakes of dropped and forward passes by the North and
Midlands side saved the South from receiving a hefty defeat.
Another factor in this low scoring match was the failure of Graham Kiddie to
land his many kicks at goal.
The home side were 15-0 up at the interval from tries by Ross Chassels and
Jamie Philip (both Aberdeen University), and Alan Davidson (Morgan Academy).
Following the break, South lifted their play and flanker Ian McDougall (Kelso
Harlequins) crashed over for an unconverted try. In the closing quarter of the
match, the North and Midlands added their fourth unconverted try of the match
when Jonathan Davies (Howe of Fife) went over.
Dan McDonald, the Huntly right-wing, broke a bone in a hand, and was replaced
by Dave Jones of Dunferm-line/Rosyth.
North Midlands Under-18s - R Chassels (Aberdeen Uni); D McDonald (Huntly), G

UNDISPUTED snooker king Stephen Hendry lifted the UK crown for the fourth time
in six years at Preston last night and warned: ``There is definitely room for
improvement.''
A 10-3 demolition of arch-rival Peter Ebdon earned the 26-year-old Scot a
#70,000 jackpot from the Royal Liver Assurance prize fund of #380,000.
In addition, he scooped #25,000 more for a 147 maximum against stablemate Gary
Wilkinson in the last 16.
Just for good measure, hot-shot Hendry rounded off another superb display with
a clearance of 146 in the final frame of last night's contest.
Despite that, the five-times world champion claimed after having secured the
twenty-fourth ranking title of a glittering career: ``You'll see the best of me
in the next two or three years.
``But if I'm to improve, I need someone to push me.''
There doesn't appear much chance of that happening on the evidence of the past
15 days. He slaughtered fellow Scot and provisional world No.2 John Higgins 9-1
in the semi-final and has now dismantled the provisional No.3, who in the past
has enjoyed numerous battle royals with the unstoppable Scot. So who else is
there?
In six matches at Preston the super-Scot has an aggregate frame record of
55-15, and not one opponent has taken more than three frames off him.
``My main aim for the rest of the season is to try and be more consistent. I
want to be involved at least to the end of every tournament,'' said Hendry.
``Last season I was either winning tournaments or getting knocked out in the
early rounds.''
Ebdon, appearing in his first UK final, had defeated Hendry twice this year but
lost their last meeting when he was beaten in the final of the Regal Masters in
Motherwell in September. Overall, he had three wins and five defeats in
previous head-to-head clashes with the No.1, and six of their eight meetings
had gone to deciding frames, including two contests in which Hendry had held
four-frame leads.
But this time Ebdon was never given a chance of upsetting the odds. He soon
found himself 4-0 adrift as Hendry knocked in breaks of 118 and 79 before the
Londoner opened his account with 76 in frame 5.
Crucially in the next three frames he found himself ahead but missed vital
balls, and Hendry cleared with successive runs of 66, 69, and 52.
The first session ended with Hendry 7-2 ahead and though his 25-year-old
Wellingborough-based opponent won the opening frame on the restart, the match
was soon over.
Twice in succession Ebdon broke down at the vital moment, and runs of 59 and 49
took Hendry within one frame of the winning post.
There was never any chance of a second maximum, as he potted a pink with a red
right at the start of his 146 clearance. But it brought the house down when the
final black disappeared, prompting Hendry to say: ``I love this town.''
Ebdon who gained a runner-up prize of #37,000 said: ``I've had a good
week-and-a-half and one bad day. But I'm sure I will get my time against him.
``The balls didn't run particularly kindly and though I didn't miss too many
balls, Stephen punished me severely.''

SCOTTISH internationalist Frank Morris scored an equaliser 19 seconds from time
to give premier division strugglers Fife Flyers a point in a 7-7 draw with
Nottingham Panthers at Kirkcaldy last night.
Flyers pulled their netminder in a bid to salvage something from the game and
won a face-off in Panthers end. The puck fell to Morris, and he scrambled it
home to send the 2000 home fans wild and complete a dismal weekend for the
Englishmen, who lost their grip on the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup with a 5-2 defeat by
Sheffield Steelers on Saturday.
Panthers, with netminder Scott O'Connor in good form, held a 3-1 lead after 13
minutes, but Flyers hit back to level at 3-3 by the first break. The English
side went 5-3 ahead at the mid-point only to see Mark Morrison's men pull back
to 5-5 two minutes into the final stanza.
Panthers went 7-5 ahead with nine minutes to go and it looked over for Flyers
until Doug Marsden slid home their sixth with four minutes left and Morris
proved the hero with his second of the night in the final minute.
Premier division - Fife 7, Notingham 7; Humberside 9, Newcastle 4; Cardiff 7,
Basingstoke 2; Durham 6, Milton Keynes 6; Slough 3, Sheffield 14.
Division 1 - Bracknell 8, Medway 3; Dumfries 16, Billingham 4; Paisley 8,
Telford 10; Peterborough 0, Manchester 7; Swindon 8, Guildford 3; Solihull 4,

THE present English manager Terry Venables told me several times over the years
how he would like to own his very own football club; not just run the club as
chief executive the way he did at Spurs, but really to own it - lock, stock,
and barrel.
He had this dream while he was at Queen's Park Rangers, cherished it still
while he was at Barcelona, and insisted to me that it was the only sure way any
manager had of putting all his dreams into practice.
I think that Graeme Souness harboured the same idea at one time, but now Jim
Duffy has been handed the opportunity that those two much better-known football
figures sought; one which would place him in a similar position to Jim McLean,
who stepped from the dugout into the boardroom and who has placed his very
clear imprint on the Dens Parkers' city rivals, Dundee United.
Whether Duffy accepts the offer from Ron Dixon, the Canadian millionaire who
still owns Dundee, remains at the crux of the current situation surrounding the
Tayside club.
The player-manager has said nothing himself. The vice-chairman, Malcolm Reid,
has insisted that the offer which is on the table is totally dependent on
Duffy's acceptance.
If that falls through, Dixon will have to find other buyers to take on the
first-division club.
At the moment the proposed partnership of Reid and Duffy is the one which would
be approved by the supporters, coupling, as it does, the business sense of one
man and the football knowledge of the other.
Around Dens Park it is seen as the ``dream team''. Duffy has immense standing
among the fans because of the way he has guided the team through one apparent
crisis after another.
Clearly, Dixon has understood that, even from his Vancouver headquarters some
6000 miles away from Tayside.
The question now, though, is whether the man who has defied doctors to continue
playing the game he loves is ready to battle on all fronts to turn Dundee into
a successful club once again.
I do not pretend to know the answer to that. Presumably neither Dixon nor Reid
has the answer, either, otherwise there would have been a formal announcement
made by now.
It might seem, on the surface, to be an attractive proposition.
As Venables spelled it out to me all these years ago, it did seem an answer to
all the worries a manager has to face; no more interference from directors who
know nothing about the game, and no need to kow-tow to chairmen who will sack
you with more alacrity than they will back you when things turn sour.
Yet it was when he moved into the business side of football that Venables found
all his troubles, the ones which still haunt him today as he attempts to
prepare his English team for the European Championships next summer.
It could be that Duffy is mulling over these problems which have pursued
Venables down through the years since his famous bust-up with Spurs' Alan Sugar.
There is plenty to think about. Football acumen may not transfer easily to the
business side of the game.
At Tannadice, United have suffered since Jim McLean gave up his managerial post.
They did win the Scottish Cup under the guidance of Ivan Golac, but they are
now sitting in the first division on the same points as Duffy's team, who have
a match in hand.
That is a long way from their glory days in Europe.
Of course, Dundee had their own slide towards obscurity long before United
suffered.
It is only now they can claim that they are on a solid footing after years of
financial worries.
Only a personal loan from Dixon has kept them afloat, of course, and if Reid
and Duffy do accept the offer to move in, there is no guarantee that the club's
travails are over.
That, however, is the way of things at most clubs. Owning your own football
team may seem to be a dream come true, but for most men who achieve these dizzy
heights there are nightmares to follow.
Not everyone can be as successful as Jack Walker or David Murray.
Not everyone can afford to throw many millions of pounds into a club and
continue to do so until success arrives.
All of this will be churning through Duffy's mind as he weighs up the offer he
has been made.
He must decide soon, and while the fans want him to take on the job and while
it is clearly the best solution for Dixon, who wants to dump Dundee and devote
more time to his many other business interests around the globe, Duffy is the
man who has been put on the spot.
It will not be an easy decision for the Dens Park manager to make, but while he
ponders the issues he can always look on the bright side of life - after all,
he might have been offered Hearts and their #5m overdraft.

PETER Monteith will be looking to consolidate his position at the top of The
Herald's Scottish trainers' championship at Edinburgh today when Killimor Lad
takes on Lucinda Russell's impressive Kelso winner Rocket Run in the Lasswade
Novices' Chase.
Monteith celebrated the 150th winner of his career at Catterick last week when
Flash of Realm, somewhat luckily, landed the Bobby Faulkner Memorial Chase.
The evens favourite was struggling three lengths behind Grazamber when the
leader took a crashing fall two fences from home.
Flash of Realm's victory gave the Rosewell man his thirteenth success of the
season and he now has a lead of eight over Russell and Colin Parker, with
reigning champion Len Lungo, on four.
Monteith intended to have four runners today but, after having walked the
Musselburgh track on Saturday, he found the going on the fast side, and
withdrew three.
Apart from a disappointing run at Hexham when he was pulled up, much to the
consternation of the trainer, Killimor Lad has performed consistently, with one
win - albeit the only finisher in a three-horse race - two seconds, and a third.
The former Irish point-to-pointer will have to be on his best jumping form if
he is to topple Rocket Run, who stayed on strongly to defeat Martin Pipe's
Banntown Bill decisively at Kelso last week.
Russell continues to make a big impact in the North in her first season as a
licence-holder, and her consistent chaser, Fiveleigh Builds, is almost certain
to start favourite for #5000 Wee Jimmy Mitchell Handicap Chase.
He won his first two races and has never been out of the frame in five outings.
Course and distance winner Countorus, has yet to find the form in which he was
successful in three novice chases last season, and Nigel Tinkler's Puritan may
pose the greatest threat.
Although he is having his first outing, the six-year-old gelding is suited by
the tight track, and won a novice chase here a year ago.
Pims Gunner is a sound jumper and genuine sort, but will have to improve on his
performance at Kelso last week when sixth behind High Padre, with Fiveleigh
Builds in second place.
Jim Goldie must have an excellent chance of breaking his duck with
Thisonesforalice in the Levy Board Handicap Hurdle.
The seven-year-old ran a promising race at Aintree when runner-up to Anlace in
a conditional jockeys' handicap hurdle.
If he repeats that performance, the son of Lochnager should bring overdue
success to the Uplawmoor yard.

EURO '96 chief Glenn Kirton yesterday slammed suggestions that the FA is facing
a #5m deficit when England stage the finals next summer.
``The alarmist talk of losing millions is rubbish,'' said the European
Championship tournament director.
``The bottom line is that both myself and Sir Bert Millichip (FA chairman) have
an undertaking from UEFA that they will not allow the tournament to make a loss
for the home association.''
While the FA have revised their budget for the first major competition they
have hosted since the World Cup in 1966, Kirton still believes they will come
home with a profit, around #2.5m if they manage to sell all 1.3m tickets.
But he insists: ``We are committed to staging an excellent tournament - and
excellence comes before profit.
``The championship belongs to UEFA, who take the largest proportion of the
income after the competing teams have taken their share for the development of
European football. The FA acts as UEFA's agent in this process.''
Kirton said the quality-before-profit principle applied particularly in the
areas of ticket sales, crowd policing, ground facilities for fans, and working
conditions for the media.
``We will ensure Euro '96 delivers on all these terms and that the Championship
will be a resounding success,'' he added.
Kirton also hit out at suggestions that the FA has gone ``cap in hand'' to UEFA
to ask for financial help.
England has asked for a contribution to soaring media costs and for one million
Swiss francs the FA have had to pay to buy back ``on-screen'' rights from the
European Broadcasting Union as part of a computer deal with a company called
Sema.
``UEFA have indicated that these are exceptional costs which they may pay
back,'' he said.
But he pointed out that the FA always regarded this tournament as a prestige
occasion, not as an opportunity to swell their own coffers.
``We do not control the commercial rights, we do not control the television
rights.
``We do have some control over ticketing and we will get 20% of any profit from
that. At the moment we need to sell 70% to break even and, if we manage to sell
100%, we will make a profit of between #2.5m and #3m.
``They are going extremely well. We have sold almost 400,000 on the UK market
and have to take it as read that the 440,000 available for the competing teams
will be taken up.
``That is all before a single game is known, so that's a pretty fair rate of
sale.''

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
FORT William could hold on to five top players put up for free transfer at the
weekend because of a cash shortage.
A mystery benefactor is understood to have offered to meet the Inverness and
Aberdeen-based quintet's travelling expenses.
Defenders Mike Andrew and Billy Skinner, goalkeeper Billy Neilson, midfielder
Alan MacDonald, and top scorer Alan Moir, will now be offered the chance to
stay.
Fort manager Henrik Madej said: ``It has been a traumatic week for me. They are
not only good footballers, but good personal friends. ''
Enquiries have been made about the five, but Madej stressed: ``They are all
still signed to Fort William and, unless any are set on leaving, they will
remain so.''
All five thought they were lining up for Fort for the last time on Saturday,
and the air of gloom showed as Deveronvale destroyed the visitors 4-1.
Elsewhere, Keith gained revenge for their Qualifying Cup final defeat by
beating Fraserburgh 4-2 with Scott Taylor scoring a double.
Peterhead lost 2-1 at home to Brora, and Elgin were trounced 4-1 at Buckie.
Cove Rangers secured a convincing 4-1 win against Nairn County.

BIG NEWS! The GHK dinner is safe again! Many of you will be shocked and
saddened to know that what was once the most outrageous and dangerous dinner in
the UK for speakers has now become a gathering for a listening audience. I hear
Chris Spence got lost later, but there you have it.
``I am not going to show them I'm nervous,'' I said to Big Jill as I left the
house. Ten minutes later I was back having had to return from the Pond Hotel to
change out of my suit into black tie. There's nothing worse than turning up in
the wrong rig.
``I think you've now screwed up in that department,'' she said as I slipped
past her, giving me a knowing look that only women can.
Only speakers know what it's like to sit there at the top table, hardly able to
eat a thing, when you've just been invited as a macabre side show. I was to be
last up out of four.
Each time I passed the players' tables I could hear mutterings. They were scary
mutterings.
The incomparable Jimmy Martin was chairman. ``You've never written a decent
thing about GHK,'' he said in his intro, signalling me to my feet. Or at least
I think that's what he said. I hadn't had a single drink but my senses were
racing. My heart was pumping.
I could feel the apprehension in the room. On the one hand they all worried a
bit that I might suffer some dreadful fate. On the other they were desperate to
see it happen to the bloke they hate to a man. They were filled with the kind
of fear that tightens your testicles when you're about to sit down to a
terrible horror movie. You don't want to watch, but you can't miss a thing. You
want to groan as the blood flows. Oh, lovely!
Fifteen minutes later, like a flirtatious meeting with a 19-year-old blonde,
and it was all over. Okay, I'm boasting at 15 minutes. I lived. Or, more
accurately, they let me live. God knows how, but Harry Houdini would have been
proud.
But the message was simple. Here we all are in Glasgow, this great big city,
fighting out own little territorial battles, and going nowhere. I can pretend
as a Glasgow Accie that I hate GHK.
I don't. I could pretend that I hate West. I don't. I admire West hugely for
what they do with no direct feeder system.
What I gathered from the GHK dinner on Saturday - and GHK are the biggest club
in the city - is that the good Glasgow rugby people who filled that room all
now think that there has to be a new look at what is to happen to kick-start
the city into the next few years.
I looked at the players in the room. How much better is Graham Shiel than Harry
Bassi? Who would you rather put into a sevens team? If it is either, then it's
a marginal call.
There was Alan Watt. How we should have used him. There won't be many better
second rows than Cecil du Plessis. It was a room filled with rugby people, and
I think it was a room filled with rugby people who know that their club could
do better.
It was one of the assembled throng, and I won't name him, who came out with the
most observant line. ``Just what is our long-term aim in Glasgow?'' he asked.
Quite late it was.
``Nobody has sat down and tried to figure out what we want from the city. When
we formed GHK we did so to provide the best standard of rugby for the players
leaving the schools. That has changed. What we are needing now is a strategic
view. We now need to ensure that we can create a club that can take on the best
and beat them.''
We all nodded. It was sheer common sense. At the moment we have Glasgow Accies
employing Kevin Greene, one of the best coaches in the world, and I am sure
that is partly to try for our own success and thumb our noses at GHK, but I am
convinced it's also in the hope that GHK say: ``Okay, we see you're serious -
let's talk.''
GHK have made huge strides themselves. West of Scotland likewise. Hillhead
Jordanhill want to be a big club, and they have New Zealanders. Glasgow
Southern have grabbed the bull by the horns. Cartha want to go places. But
there isn't room for everyone at the top. Maybe two clubs.
Don't worry, I'm not going to do the ``let's pull down the fence'' bit, because
I know it winds people up. But the clubs in Glasgow have to sit down round a
table and hammer something out, and soon. There isn't an easy answer about what
happens to all the fourth XV players. But there are enough sensible thinkers in
this city to lead us forward.
I escaped the hanging. But only just.

RALLYING
YESTERDAY'S South West Saab Galloway Hills event brought the Scottish forest
rallying season to its traditional close for the year, and it was the Irish who
carried off the spoils of victory.
Stephen Harron and Avril Magee won by almost a minute at the end of 40 miles of
forest stages. Harron had only recently discovered his winning ways when he
took his first event two months ago at Enniskillen, and he carried that form
across the water yesterday.
He contested this event for the first time last year when he had been second
overall until his gearbox broke, but there was no stopping him yesterday. He
took 16 seconds out of the 66 car field on the first of five stages and
thereafter pulled away.
Sandy Dalgarno salvaged Scottish pride with second place. Third was Jon Burn,
fresh from victory on the previous day's Grizedale Stages in the Lake District.
Four-times Scottish champion Drew Gallacher finished fourth overall, following
on from his runner-up position behind Burn in England the previous day. Final
results:
1, Stephen Harron/Avril Magee (Ford Sierra Cosworth) 41min 55sec; 2, Sandy
Dalgarno/Sandy Taylor (Ford Escort Cosworth) 42-46; 3, Jon Burn/Stan Quirk
(Ford Sierra Cosworth) 42-58; 4, Drew Gallacher/Phil Sandham (Ford Escort
Cosworth) 43-39; 5, George Gauld/Roy Campbell (Ford Escort Cosworth) 43-57; 6,
Mike Stephenson/Roy Jarvis (Ford Escort Cosworth) 44-20; 7, Jock Armstrong/John
Richardson (Peugeot 205) 45-03; 8, Alan Dickson/Graham Bisset (Ford Escort
Cosworth) 45-05; 9, Richard Montgomery/Greg Brownlow (Ford Sierra Cosworth)
45-25; 10, Derek Crossan/Peter Dowds (Opel Manta) 45-37.

WINNING golf tournaments on the European Tour is a demanding task; getting the
opportunity to win them is a great deal harder. As with aspiring tennis players
and Formula One drivers, chance would be a fine thing for the sweet young
swingers of Europe who play the Royal and Ancient game with a style, class, and
skill that makes most of their predecessors appear mediocre.
Such has been the effect of the golf explosion well beyond the confines of the
British Isles that the prospect of making lots of moolah on the major tour
inevitably has hoisted amateur standards and at the same time encouraged a
greater number of amateurs to take the game seriously.
The consequence of it all is the increasing difficulty for even the cream of
the young men chasing that place in the sun to get the card which opens the
doors to the big-time and, if they survive well enough, riches. Glory can come
later.
The enormous challenge of a pre-qualifying competition over three rounds, in
which something in the region of 600 ambitious young and not-so-young golfers
chase the 180 or so places in the qualifying tournament, is daunting enough,
but the lads are only just warming up. They then have to compete for 40 places
over six rounds, invariably over the most taxing of courses.
It is a procedure which must have been the brainchild of an ex-Burma Road
commander, 108 holes of mental torture, at the end of which the failures find
themselves back at ``Go''.
All of which should be good reason for everyone with Scottish golf interests at
heart to offer unstinting congratulations to Stephen Gallacher and Raymond
Russell, the two home stalwarts who came through the latest test at San Roque
in Spain last week.
Russell was putting himself through the agony for the third time and is
entitled to a gentle winter.
Gallacher, however, came straight from the amateur ranks to tackle the
nine-round examination for the first time and, at one stage, looked as if he
might finish in front of them all.
The 21-year-old nephew of successful Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher,
Stephen had a fine year as an amateur, winning the Scottish Strokeplay title
and the Lytham Trophy, among many other prizes, but his finest moment came as a
member of the triumphant Walker Cup team.
Even that impressive track record, however, does not prepare anybody for the
nine rounds of stress in the professional qualifying contest. Stephen would
tell you that himself.
Back home in Bathgate and still, on his own admission, ``on a high'', Gallacher
confesses that he could not sleep on the night before his final round.
``I was sitting at four under and at that point the cut was five over, so I had
nine shots in hand. You just start thinking how you would feel if you shot 80.
I suppose that is why I got a bit negative in the last round. Maybe I shouldn't
have done but it was a good lesson, I suppose.''
Stephen acknowledges that the qualifying test is the toughest golf competition
that he has had to face.
``The pre-qualifying especially is hard. You could feel the tension. I was
lucky in that one of my best pals caddies for me and that helped break the
strain a bit.
``In Spain, you could see guys who had lost their card and were back trying
again for the second or third time and maybe they were trying too hard. That is
one of the dangers.
``It is also very tense until you get past the fourth round. At least you know
then you will get some kind of category that will let you play in some
tourna-ments.''
He followed the advice of Uncle Bernard by not thinking of winning.
``That was good advice because I stuck to thinking about getting my card and
didn't go for anything silly.''
Stephen, a young man who gives the impression of maturity beyond his years,
reckons he got a wee glimpse of what the pro scene will be like, the
self-discipline and restraint that is required to build a score and a career.
``In a way, the qualifying makes you think like a pro,'' he said.
His first year on the circuit will be eased financially by the backing of a
sponsor to be announced soon but before he sets out on his great adventure,
Stephen intends to seek out Bernard again for a long talk and, in his case,
listen.
``I want to ask Bernard about what is the best way to go about this year,
tournaments to play, etc. There is nobody better qualified to ask, is there?''
He knows that to survive and stay on the tour he has to get into the top 120,
which would mean winnings of around #40,000.
``That is my goal for this year. I don't want to go back to that qualifying
again and I don't want to set myself targets. It will depend on what Bernard
says about everything, including whether I need management or not.''
Whatever advice his uncle offers, Stephen already is determined to keep his
feet firmly on the fairway.
``I know there is a world of difference between being an amateur and a pro.
Hopefully, if I can hold on to my card, I can then try to progress. I don't
expect to win anything, but, if that comes along, it would be great. My aim
would be to make the cuts and take it from there.''
He and the family were still coming down from the celebrations . . . ``my
caddie brought a bottle of champagne but didn't tell me until I was through'' .
. . but now he will have a rest until after Christmas. Then he will be off to
see the Guru of Largs, Bob Torrance, to sort out some parts of his game he
feels need attention.
Stephen has never had any other ambition than to be a professional golfer.
Whatever else happens, he can claim he has made it. The next bit is even
tougher but don't bet against him reaching the top of that tree, too, in due
course. His feat in making it first time into the tour is best illustrated by
recalling that Ian Woosnam tried the qualifying method three times and never
made it, eventually getting on the circuit via the Safari Tour, and Barry Lane
had to go seven times before he got there.
It hasn't become any easier in the meantime.

DUNFERMLINE delighted the home support by turning on the style in the opening
30 minutes and scoring three times to snuff out Hamilton's weak challenge.
But then the league leaders disappointed their fans by failing to drive home
their advantage for the rest of the game.
The key to the problem was the loss of strikers Stewart Petrie and Greg Shaw,
who both went off with ankle injuries after scoring in the opening burst of
action. Their departure seemed to upset their team-mates.
But Dunfermline manager Bert Paton knows he will need more consistency from his
players to maintain their promotion challenge in a very competitive first
division.
Goals from Shaw after only three minutes, Derek Fleming in 13, and Petrie in
25, gave Dunfermline a comfortable lead.
But it was not until two minutes from time that Andy Tod added a fourth goal.
Paton said he was pleased with the way his team played in the first half, but
admitted he was very disappointed with the second-half display.
``There are still one or two players who are a bit rusty after missing games,''
he said. ``But they are coming back and we are getting there.
He added: ``When the two strikers went off, Hamilton tightened things up a bit
in the second half. The injuries affected us, but the second-half display was
not acceptable.''
Hamilton, who recorded their first league win of the season at Paisley the
previous week, never even looked like scoring against Dunfermline.
``We were well beaten by a better side,'' confessed manager Iain Munro. ``We
defended poorly. We have no complaints. They did their job very
professionally.''
Munro said the promotion race would remain very competitive with both Dundee
sides, Morton, and Dunfermline all making a strong challenge.
``They will all beat each other, and Airdrie and St Johnstone will have a say
in what is going on,'' he added.
``But Dunfermline will not be far away. They are a premier club, and that is
why they have to take a look at expanding the league.''

PRINCE Naseem Hamed can bank the regal sum of #1m for a showdown with Irish
star Wayne McCullough.
That was the figure put on the table by McCullough's American manager, Matt
Tinley, after the Ulsterman's triumphant return to Belfast to retain his WBC
title with an eighth-round stoppage of Denmark's Johnny Bredhal at the King's
Hall.
A seven-figure cheque would appeal to Hamed, but there is a crucial condition
which is likely make the offer extremely difficult to accept - ``Naz'' must
reverse through two divisions to fight McCullough at bantamweight.
Hamed has not had to trim down to the 8st 6lb division for more than a year,
has progressed to super-bantam, and on to the WBO featherweight (9st) title
during his rapid rise to stardom.
To demand that a young, growing athlete like Hamed takes off 8lb to backtrack
his career is asking a lot, probably too much, and enough to knock-out the
fight for good.
McCullough is convinced that Hamed will not lose pounds to gain them. ``Naz
won't come down to the weight because he is scared. I'd fight him any time. I
want to beat the best at my weight.''
Television executive Tinley added: ``Wayne does not need Naseem. He packed out
the King's Hall, he is on worldwide TV. But if Hamed can work and train hard to
fight at bantam, he can have #1m to fight Wayne for the most legitimate title
you'll ever have.''
McCullough is also big for a bantam and is not far away from the day when he
progresses to super-bantam and then on to feather, although his 84-year-old
American motivator and trainer Eddie Futch - rated by many as the best in the
business - insists the Irishman is still strong at the 118lb category.
McCullough's next outing is scheduled for Dublin in February or March. There
appears to be a possibility of him having a dart at the WBC super-bantam crown
of the 35-year-old Daniel Zaragoza, or a defence of his own title against
another Mexican, Jose Bueno, a winner on the Belfast undercard.
On the Belfast fight, Tinley observed: ``Bredahl was running around after
Wayne, looking like Carl Lewis disguised as Bredhal.''
And McCullough observed: ``The referee told Bredhal 30 seconds before he ended
it that he must throw more punches.''
The intervention of Mexican referee Lupe Garcia after 1min 55sec of the eighth
looked premature. The Dane was hardly given a chance to obey the orders to
punch more.

THIS result was of little use to either side as they became further detached
from the leading pack. However, it was difficult for Airdrie manager Alex
MacDonald to complain about his team's performance.
The draw was more about the brilliant individual performance of Alan Main in
Saints' goal than the shortcomings of his strikers. ``That's the second week in
a row that a goalie has had an outstanding game against us. Last week it was
Ally Maxwell, today it was Main.''  From the fifth minute when he touched over
Peter Duffield's volley from Jimmy Boyle's cross, the keeper was inspired. Jim
McIntyre's header looked netbound until Main flicked it over.
Even when Kenny Black's pass put McIntyre through, the keeper stayed on his
feet until the last second before diving to save. Another Duffield snap shot
and a drive from Boyle were both palmed away.
Main was suitably modest about his own contribution. ``They were all reaction
saves, but obviously I'm delighted about the way things are going for me now.''
Matters looked even brighter for the visitors when they took the lead early in
the second half. From Euan Donaldson's free kick, Sean Sweeney's mis-hit
clearance only reached Philip Scott, who drilled his shot low past John Martin.
Airdrie equalised with just 16 minutes to go . Black's in-swinging free kick
required only the slightest of glances from Jim McIntyre's head to leave the
keeper helpless.

BRAZILIAN star Jardel has revealed that money was the main consideration in
deciding his future lies with Rangers.
The striker was responding to criticism on Dutch television from Ajax captain
Danny Blind, who maintained that furthering Jardel's career with a bigger club
should have been the first priority.
Blind, whose penalty kick defeated Gremio to bring the World Club Championship
to Ajax, insisted: ``Jardel is a very good player and certainly could find a
place with Ajax. Everyone saw his qualities in the final.
``It is a shame he chooses to join a physical team like Rangers and puts money
before football. If you concentrate on improve your ability, then money will
come later. Most of our players could now sign for any club in Europe.''
Jardel, who will cost Rangers #2.5m to buy from the South American champions,
admitted: ``No other club offered as much money as Rangers. The salary is much
bigger than I imagined I would earn.
``I do not know very much about Scottish football except that it will be cold
and wet. But when you are to be paid such a wage there is no point in moaning.
``I will be expected to perform and produce the goods, just like I did in
Brazil, where I attracted the interest of many clubs.
``Many people were surprised when Romario and then Ronaldo, two of Brazil's
best players, left for a small country like Holland to join PSV Eindhoven. The
conditions there are the same as Scotland.
``They could have chosen the glamour of Serie A, Spain or stayed in Brazil but
they became rich, famous, and better players in Holland. Romario then moved on
to a bigger stage with Barcelona and Ronaldo will follow. I can do the same
with Rangers.
``I don't have to spend the rest of my career in Scotland but while I am there
I will make sure the club and their supporters are satisfied with my
performances.''

RANGERS' latest problems with the SFA disciplinary committee may be construed
by some as a continuation of the alleged selective application (in their case),
of both the football and criminal laws. This is for the punters to judge for
themselves.
Last Friday's highly publicised case does, however, add weight to Rangers'
argument. Paul Gascoigne's behaviour in the recent match against Aberdeen
cannot be condoned, provocation or otherwise, but Rangers' statement that
``certain aspects of the reporting of disciplinary matters require close
scrutiny'' is surely correct.
I, along with Rangers, have a problem with the use of referee supervisors. This
is because, in this and other recent cases, the referee supervisor's evidence
has been accepted on incidents where the referee has taken no action during the
game. I do not profess to know the exact details of what goes on behind the
closed doors of Park Gardens, but this must be the case, mustn't it? I mean
they don't accept television evidence!
If the SFA are going to allow the supervisor to overrule the referee, then
logically this is an admission that the referee can get it wrong. Furthermore,
if they are willing to admit that referees are fallible in disciplinary matters
then they must surely be prepared to accept that some of their judgments on
play are also wrong.
Most of us can recall examples where undeniably bad decisions by referees have
cost clubs dearly. When equally bad judgments are witnessed by the supervisors
in future, can we look forward to them overturning them retrospectively? I
think not! It is high time that Mr Farry and his organisation got consistent in
these matters.
For over 100 years, we have been told that a referee's decision, good or bad,
is final and I would advocate that this should remain so. My understanding is
that the other officials are referee supervisors and if so, their only duty
should be to report on the performance of the referee, NOT the players. If
their reports are to be used in evidence against players then they should be
submitted within two hours of the conclusion of the game. This would eliminate
the possibility of their being influenced by what they see on television, or
indeed read in the press.

CURRIE eventually ran out winners against an experimental Edinburgh line-up in
an entertaining game to mark the opening of the new #45,000 floodlights at
Malleny Park.
Currie were first to score in just five minutes, when Dougie Rogerson and
Michael Plumb sent New Zealander Dean Sheppard cutting inside the defence to
score between the posts, John Morrison converting.
It was Sheppard again who crossed for a try on the half-hour but Campbell
Aitken opened Edinburgh's account with a penalty four minutes before half-time,
and the gap was narrowed further thanks to a fine try from Biggar centre
Lindsay Graham, converted by Michael Duncan.
Scott Forrester scored a try for Currie in 54 minutes but, with both teams keen
to play an expansive game, Edinburgh took the lead with a Duncan penalty and a
try in 61 minutes from Heriot's full back Stewart Lang.
Currie finished the stronger side, and with six minutes remaining, No.8 Mark
Blair broke away from a scrummage and sent in Rogerson for a touchdown, then
Forrester scored his second with the last move of the game, both converted by
Morrison.
The match proved costly in terms of injuries for Edinburgh, and for Heriot's in
particular. Graham Dall retired with a broken tooth while Tam McVie was
stretchered off and taken to hospital for a check-up, and Campbell Aitken
departed at half-time.
A substantially different Edinburgh team will begin their inter-district
championship challenge against the Exiles on Wednesday.

Melrose 31, Gala 11
JUST as the light was fading at The Greenyards, the Premiership trophy was in
the bag. But it wasn't headed for the Melrose trophy cabinet. It was back in
the Murrayfield bagman's hold-all ready to re-merge in a fortnight's time after
the championship showdown between Stirling County and Heriot's FP.
Melrose have now played all the cards in their hand. To discover whether or not
it is a winning hand they must now await the outcome of that Goldenacre game on
December 16. If Stirling beat Heriot's by 43 points or more, then the
championship is theirs. If not, then Melrose take the honours.
It is not the most satisfactory manner in which to bring down the curtain on an
enthralling championship season but, with the Western Samoan tour and the final
stages of the Premiership calendar running in tandem, alternative scenarios
were few and far between. Just thank the weatherman that Jack Frost was not
added to the equation.
It would have been all over on Saturday if Stirling had lost to Boroughmuir -
and how the defending champions must now be ruing their slow start to the
championship campaign and that home draw against Melrose last weekend. But now
it goes to the wire and, although it must be a long shot, a second championship
resting on wiping out that 43-point differential remains a possibility, just.
To refresh the memory, when County and Heriot's met first time around this
season, the scoreline was 38-6 in Stirling's favour. Add 11 points to that
margin this time and what threatened at one point to be a wash-out season for
Stirling will have a rainbow at journey's end.
At The Greenyards on Saturday, Gala should have been put to the sword by
Melrose. Sadly for Gala, pre-match bravura that they had nothing to lose and
that the pressure was all on Melrose failed to produce the kind of display
which would have been a fitting farewell to Division I.
The Melrose star which shone most brightly was Craig Joiner. He had a hat trick
and combined aggression and balance in his running, which suggests that, after
injury, he returns to the fray sharp and eager with the Five Nations' beckoning
next month.
Bryan Redpath had another fine game and the facts that Joiner saw so much of
the ball and that Melrose's other try came from Gary Parker on the opposite
wing indicate that the half-backs were spreading play when the opportunity
arose. Twice, the intruding Shepherd was involved in Melrose tries and Graham
Shiel, with a majestic break, was mostly to thank for one of Joiner's. From a
Melrose viewpoint, and with the points chase in mind, the pity was that they
scored only eight points in the second half.
Gavin Dalgleish kicked Gala into the lead with a penalty goal after eight
minutes. Parker equalised with a penalty after a Shiel half-break which caught
Gala offside. Gala were defending at full-stretch when Parker kicked his second
penalty, then Joiner had his first try, converted by Parker, after a Redpath
break, good back-up work by Joiner and Feau'nati, and a ruck-feed from Redpath
on the line.
His second try, after 34 minutes, proved the truth of that old adage which says
that speed kills. The ball went via Redpath, Chalmers, and Sheil before Joiner,
still with a bit to do despite a two-man overlap, sped in at the corner.
Dalgleish, suffering as did scrum half Paterson from haphazard service from the
Gala pack, had a penalty for the Maroons as half-time approached but Melrose
hammered home their superiority with Joiner's third try. From a scrummage on
the Gala 10-metre line, the ball zipped along - Redpath, Chalmers, Shiel,
Shepherd - and the winger made it 23-6 at the turn.
Parker's try was a gem. A reverse pass from the base of a scrummage by Redpath
saw Shepherd careering down the middle and Bain sending the effervescent Parker
over. Gala were awarded a couple of penalties, both missed by Dalgleish, before
Parker kicked his third and a minute from the end Gala, at last, were rewarded
for a spirited final 10 minutes with a try by Moncrieff after spadework by
Amos, Weir, and Paterson.

Watsonians 39, Hawick 6
IT HAD all the hype of a Gavin Hastings show. The TV cameras were on the
touchline, the autograph hunters were there in strength, and the charismatic
former Scotland captain was nodding to or shaking hands with all sorts of
visitors to Myreside.
Although Big Gav was getting top billing, the supporting cast in the
Watsonians' line-up soon proved it was no one-man show.
With the first-division title now a two-horse race, Watsonians must be
reflecting ruefully on some of the uncharacteristic slip-ups they have made.
They could so easily have been right at the top of the tree this season.
Their back division moves at electric pace allied to super-glue handling that
could tear apart the best defences in the country when they are on song.
Injury-stricken Hawick were witnesses at their cost to the devastating cutting
edge of this Watsonian team in full flight.
Every player behind fly-half Andrew Garry scored in the six-try bonanza. The
bold Gavin did not get a touchdown but collected nine points with his trusty
right foot and slipped into every position in the back division at some time or
another.
The visiting Greens had eight first XV players out of action but can be proud
of their younger set asked to do a job.
Other than Watsonians, Hawick had managed at least one win over the other
first-division combatants. But the Myreside team earned the ``double'' in
devastating fashion.
The first cruel blow was struck in just 27 seconds when Kiwi Si Farland went
over for a try when skipper Fergus Henderson caught the visitors napping with a
quick lineout throw-in after Hawick full back Graeme Renwick had allowed an
Andrew Garry diagonal kick to trundle away from him and into touch. He dropped
the ball and Henderson picked it up to feed his hookers.
It took the Greens a long time to recover from that and in fact they were 17-0
behind before they intruded into Watsonian territory with any real threat.
Garry, Jamie Mayer, Scott Hastings, and John Kerr interpassed before the
younger Hastings went over.
Then a burst by Scott H sent Henderson careering over for another try.
Hawick got into the game about now but despite some well-earned possession,
failed to produce an incisive edge to beat the Watsonians' blanket defence.
Just before the interval, Gavin Hastings had his only penalty success.
Hawick restarted with renewed vigour and Grant Blacklock and Grant Harris
responded to the lead of skipper Brian Renwick. A lot of ball was won and run
from one side of the pitch to the other. Green jerseys launched themselves at
the Watsonians line but there was no way through.
Fly-half Scott Welsh failed with a drop attempt then, in desperation to get
points on the board, kicked two penalties after numerous awards had been run in
an effort for a touchdown.
Watsonians absorbed all that pressure and the flamboyant Gavin Hastings burst
on the scene again to take play to the other end and set up a score for Alan
Kittle which Gavin converted.
Scott Hastings set winger John Kerr on the road to the Hawick line and his
power took him over with defenders clinging to him.
Gavin converted but failed to goal a fine try by the straight-running Jamie
Mayer, who finished off great support work by both his wingers.
Watsonians - G Hastings; F Henderson, S Hastings, J Mayer, J Kerr; A Garry, J
Weston; M Stanaway, S Farland, A Kittle, S Grimes, C Mather, G Hannah, C Brown,

NINE clubs in the first division all have the one question this morning - will
nothing upset Morton?
The Greenock club in recent weeks have had to deal first with the transfer of
their outstanding midfielder Derek McInnes to Rangers and then with the sight
of their manager Allan McGraw being rushed to hospital during one of their
matches.
Yet, they still seem to power on regardless in much the same way as manager
McGraw bounced back to return to fitness and work within 48 hours.
The other clubs had been waiting to see if there would be any sign of weakness,
but there was no suggestion of uncertainty during this 90 minutes, and indeed
there was an air almost of inevitability that the Greenock side would end up
the winners despite a goalless first half.
That view was enhanced a minute into the second period when Derek Lilley opened
their account when he shrugged off the challenge of Colin Sutherland to score,
and continued with a double from Marko Rajamaki in a four-minute flourish.
Manager McGraw has his own explanation for the continued success. ``There is
competition for places in this side, and the players are responding,'' he said.
``Look at our keeper David Wylie. Since we signed the Cameroon keeper Andre
Boe, David has not had a bad game.
``We also have strength and flair in the middle of the park, where Janne
Lindberg is playing a captain's role and where Alan Mahood sees things that
other players cannot see.
``Up front there is the like of Derek Lilley, who has the pace to worry any
defence, and Marko, who got those two goals today, is very dangerous at the far
post.''
Certainly, the truthful Clydebank coach Brian Wright was under no illusions
about the outcome, for he said: ``I have no complaints for they were a better
team in all departments.''

GOLF ROUND-UP
COREY Pavin, the US Open champion, won the richest individual prize in golf in
the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City yesterday. The 36-year-old Californian
won by five from 1993 champion Nick Price to take the $1m jackpot with a
72-hole total of 276, 12 under par.
``It's kind of fun to win a million dollars. I've never done that before,'' he
said after his six-under-par 66, the lowest of the week, took him clear.
Price birdied three of the first five holes to go one ahead, but bogeyed the
sixth, which Pavin birdied. The final blow came at the par-5 fourteenth. Price
took 6 while Pavin had a birdie. For the second day in a row Pavin did not drop
a shot.
Scotland's Sam Torrance shot a closing 72 for fourth place in his first
appearance in the event.
Nick Faldo's poor showing was compensated when he was named first winner of the
``Canon Shot of the Year'' for his 93-yard pitch to four feet on the final hole
of his Ryder Cup match with Curtis Strange. Final scores:
276 - C Pavin (USA) 69, 72, 69, 66 (#666,000).
281 - N Price (Zimbabwe) 71, 67, 72, 71 (#166,000).
283 - B Langer (Germany) 72, 69, 71, 71 (#133,000).
284 - S Torrance (Britain) 69, 73, 70, 72 (#116,000).
287 - T Lehman (USA) 71, 70, 73, 73.
289 - D Frost (S Africa) 74, 76, 71, 68.
291 - N Faldo (Britain) 72, 78, 69, 72; C Rocca (Italy) 76, 75, 67, 73; E Els
(S Africa) 72, 72, 69, 78.
293 - V Singh (Fiji) 75, 72, 74, 72.
297 - C Montgomerie (Britain) 79, 76, 71, 71.
298 - P Mickelson (USA) 73, 77, 72, 76.
q CRAIG Parry won a duel with Michael Campbell to win the Greg Norman Classic
at The Lakes course in Sydney yesterday. Parry shot a level-par 73 in blustery
conditions for a 16-under-par aggregate.
Campbell, four behind, birdied the fourteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth while
Parry bogeyed the sixteenth. But Campbell missed a nine-footer for par at the
last.
Greg Norman, who took an 11 on the par-5 fourteenth on Saturday, finished,
ironically, 11 behind. Leading scores (Australians unless stated):
276 - C Parry 65, 67, 71, 73.
277 - M Campbell (New Zealand) 66, 68, 71, 72.
280 - B Faxon (USA) 68, 70, 70, 72.
283 - S Appleby 67, 73, 75, 68; J-L Guepy (France) 70, 63, 74, 76; T Price 68,
69, 71, 75.
Others included: 286 - P Senior 68, 67, 76, 75. 287 - G Norman 72, 67, 79, 69.
288 - G Evans (Britain) 69, 74, 74, 71; J Daly (USA) 74, 71, 68, 75.
q DAVIS Love and Beth Daniel won the JC Penney Mixed Team Classic yesterday
over the par-71 Copperhead Course at the Innisbrook Resort in Florida and
became the first two-time winners of the event.
They shot a final-round seven-under-par 63 in the modified alternate stroke
format to finish on 27-under-par 257, a tournament record by five shots, and
claim $162,500 each. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
257 - D Love and B Daniel 66, 65, 63, 63.
259 - R Gamez and H Alfredsson (Sweden) 63, 67, 65, 64.
260 - J Parnevik and A Sorenstam (both Sweden) 67, 66, 64, 63.
262 - M McCumber and L Davies (England) 63, 65, 67, 67.
Other score: 266 - D Forsman and P Wright (Scotland) 64, 67, 67, 68.
q MASASHI ``Jumbo'' Ozaki shot a four-under-par 68 for a 272 aggregate to win
the Golf Nippon Series in Japan.

MEN'S HOCKEY
CIBA Kelburne and Insights Inverleith will not figure this season in the battle
for the First Division title in the National Indoor league.
Instead they have been doomed to the relegation playoffs after occupying the
bottom two positions at the end of the first phase.
Their miserable form was matched only yesterday by the Scottish Hockey Union's
organisation of the day's event when the technical delegate and one of the
umpires failed to appear at the Bells sports centre in Perth.
A more pleasing aspect of the day's play was Grange giving the distinct
impression that they could emerge as potential rivals to Insights Menzieshill
and MIM, despite losing 7-1 yesterday to Menzieshill.
MIM too are gradually moving into their old familiar groove. Like Menzieshill
they picked up maximum points.
In Division Two Morgan catapulted themselves up the table by crushing Aberdeen
side Stronachs AGSFP 17-6.

THE Scottish Rugby Union has now received an amended contract from the
international squad's lawyer, and negotiations will begin with a view to having
the players under contract to the union before Christmas.
The contract, said to be worth around #22,500-a-man if the Scottish side had
won all of its five games until the end of March - last month's draw against
Western Samoa being accounted for retrospectively - effectively will make the
players employees of the SRU with all of the two-way responsibilities that such
a relationship implies.
SRU senior vice-president Fred McLeod said yesterday that the amended version
had been received only at the weekend and he had not had time to study it in
detail but the players were making observations about the intended make-up of
the cash available.
``It was, I suppose, inevitable as the negotiations continue, that the players
should seek more money, or at least, to seek to have the money divided up in a
different format. As the employers, we have to speak to them about the
distribution of money within a framework that we can afford.''
Yesterday Craig Chalmers, one of the player-representatives on the contracts
working party, said: ``We've not asked for more money, but there are a number
of things that we are not entirely happy about and the manner in which the
contract cash is divided is one of them.
q.FRED McLeod also said yesterday that the SRU were now examining ``blocks of
dates'' for the new European Championship.
McLeod was in Dublin last week for a European Championship meeting and is
reporting to the SRU. The decision on whether clubs or districts from Scotland
compete in next season's championship for the first time is dependent to a
large extent on how it will fit into the Scottish domestic season.

UNLESS you are so narrow-minded you can look through a keyhole with both eyes
open at the same time, you will have detected an absence of remorse among those
who have been bleating because a handful of footballers were summoned before
the SFA to explain recent behaviour.
It is not as though Gascoigne, Brown, Sweeney, and co. were forced to shuffle
up the hill to the front doot of Bleak House in leg irons. In fact, miscreants
usually arrive in style and leave tight-lipped and stern-faced, like men who
have been wronged.
I have lost count of the number of times journos have huddled together on the
Park Gardens pavement awaiting verdicts, but I do not recall hearing one
player, manager, or club director saying: ``Sorry.''
The apparent inability of people within the game to admit guilt, or to accept
unacceptable behaviour on the pitch which could endanger the well-being of a
fellow professional is a screaming indictment of the standards employed. If
just once someone emerging from a disciplinary hearing said: ``I got what I
deserved and I'd like to apologise for my actions,'' that just might be the
beginning of a better tomorrow for us all.
Then again if players said after a match in which they had used foul methods
against opponents that they were sorry, and if their clubs then made it clear
severe punishment would be handed down to the players, football might again be
allowed to police itself. A referee's negligence or the cunning of a player who
strikes behind the official's back should no longer mean the offender escapes
punishment.
Aberdeen have made it clear they would be taking action against Stewart
McKimmie, sent off early in the match against Partick Thistle on Saturday, for
alleged use of an elbow on Callum Milne, and the Pittodrie club are to be
commended. However, Aberdeen should have declared the extent of the punishment
and the player also ought to have issued an apology.
Football is under greater scrutiny and those who believe only the referee
should have the power to enforce justice are naive. Arguments over
technicalities concerning referee supervisors merely cloud the issues and
transmit the wrong messages to outside agencies, so let us not waste any more
time debating whose job it is to referee a football match.
It is a simple matter with the match official's word standing as law, but when
incidents which are against the spirit of the game occur and go unpunished
because the referee either missed or chose to miss them for whatever reason,
the authorities are entitled to expect a supervisor in the stand to make
reference to them. It is then the SFA's duty to take the appropriate action.
Since there are clubs who wish to use the mere wording of the supervisor's job
as a means to protect players whose behaviour may have been reckless, perhaps
the relevant description should be amended. Let's all start behaving sensibly
and perhaps then the procurator-fiscal will remain a fan of the game rather
than a participant.
So many people become incensed when the police are ordered to investigate
on-field behaviour and yet some of those who complain loudest possess the
remedy. Club managers, directors, and chairmen have to make it clear to their
teams that severe financial penalties will be imposed when a player resorts to
unacceptable behaviour, and please, don't give me that stuff about the game
being one of passions and adrenalin.
Wild tackles and flailing arms and legs, and the heading of anything other than
the ball cannot be allowed.
Acts of violence which endanger the health of others must be discouraged, and
surely it is obvious to everyone by now that when football fails to punish
offenders, some higher authority will.
It is wrong to let players believe anything they do inside the white borders of
a football pitch should be considered beyond reproach. Again I say it is the
duty of clubs to make their players certain they must play fair and that if
their tempers are uncontrolled, there will be serious repercussions.
The recent stance adopted by Rangers when they were unhappy about some of their
players being called to the SFA on the basis of a supervisor's report and not
one compiled by the referee, was ridiculous. Instead of complaining, Rangers
ought to have taken their own action from the beginning.
The game and everyone involved must start playing their parts and a little more
honesty has to be employed. Football's people must accept there is a greater
responsibility weighing on them and it does no good when players, who may have
crossed the line between what is and isn't acceptable, are protected by their
clubs.
The sooner footballers believe it is not a weakness to say ``sorry'' the easier
it will be to keep procurators-fiscal at bay, but as things stand you would
have to say the attitudes of just about everyone involved in football are
irresponsible.
The perfect example of what is wrong in our game was displayed in the circus
which surrounded Duncan Ferguson's recent return to Goodison after a spell in
prison.
He was given a hero's welcome and took a bow before Everton's fans in a display
which suggested he had been victimised, that somehow he had been wronged. It
was a demonstration of football's inability to grasp the fact the sport is not
above the law.
What sort of messages did Ferguson's welcome send out to the children who watch
and play the game? Football really is a most disrespectful and irresponsible
world.

THERE was talk of priests and gaffes but no mention of the unfortunate Bishop
Casey of Galway, undone by a woman's wrath. It was a day when long silences
were punctuated by tall tales.
St Andrew's Day means different things to different people. It's about Saltires
and Scottishness, and this year Michael Forsyth and the Constitutional
Convention.
For one disconsolate group it meant the last day's salmon fishing on their
favourite river in Dumfriesshire. And so it was that three men and I went
fishing - but not in a boat.
A day on the river, it seems, requires rigorous planning and as many
accoutrements as Vlad the Impaler.
First, the all-important provisions. I sensed some deep-seated insecurity when
The Three packed what appeared to be enough for a convoy to Bosnia. Clearly,
however, this was an integral part of the day out. And so there was soup,
sandwiches, cake, coffee, and the ubiquitous hip flask.
Next came the equipment. Salmon rods, at 17ft, are as long as many rivers are
wide. There were dinky little boxes of flies, nets (for the countless salmon to
be caught), reels galore, torches, and all manner of lines from floating ones
to sinking ones.
And yes, they did all have Barbours on and waders that reached up to their
oxters.
The business of getting started is laborious. Putting the rods together was a
bit like playing with a Meccano set and the boys loved it. They paraded up and
down the river, checking out their favourite pools.
And then the fishing got under way. Style is all. As in all walks of life, you
either have it or you don't. One of the party was relatively new to the sport
and flaggelated the water with a style reminiscent of the Wild West. The salmon
would have had to be remedial to be fooled by Rawhide.
Another was more timorous. His line went on to the water like an apology, in
marked contrast to his appearance. Fatboy just wasn't at home on the water.
But The Third Man was an expert. Confidence oozed from every cast and he seemed
completely oblivious to the strong east wind blowing straight at us as his fly
shot out in a true line across the water.
The morning went by. The salmon, apparently, were sleeping, for nobody caught
as much as a glimpse of one. Not a single splash had disturbed the silence,
except possibly from Rawhide.
Then it was time for lunch. It was like being back at school. ``Oh, you've got
egg. That's good. I'll give you a ham salad for one of those,'' Fatboy enthused.
Fishing bores have much in common with their golfing counterparts. The golfers
gather in the clubhouse reliving that shank on the fifth or the hook on the
twelfth and discussing the added distance with graphite clubs.
Meanwhile, the fishermen huddle on the grass with tales from the riverbank.
They ponder the merits of stiff rods, weight forward line, Delphi Silvers and
Silver Wilkinsons. Lunch passed with stories of former glories, of minnows
missed and tussles with 20 pounders.
Then it was back to the fishing. But boys will be boys. As children they
compete to see who can pee furthest up the wall. As men on the river little has
changed. By mid afternoon, with the salmon still posted missing, they were in
competition again - to see who could cast the longest line.
The waiting finally got to Rawhide and he erupted. He thrashed his rod across
the water, wailing: `` Bite, you bastards.'' The salmon weren't listening.
Changed days from 1870 when a group of four went on a fishing expedition to the
Outer Hebrides.
They went by steamboat from Greenock to Harris where fish would be ``plentiful
and simple-minded''.
And indeed there were so many ``dancing about like live ingots of silver'' that
they had no trouble in catching more than 200lbs of sea trout and salmon in a
week as well as shooting gulls, pigeons and guillemots. They duly stuffed many
of their trophies and then set sail for home.
Their week, including fishing, food, accommodation, horse hire, boats and
copious quantities of Talisker came to a modest #14 and five shillings - for
four. Changed days indeed.

PAULINE Robertson, the Scottish captain, has dropped a bombshell on the sport
by announcing her withdrawal from the squad for the finals of the European
Indoor Nations Cup, which Scotland will be hosting at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall
from January 26 to 28.
Robertson, who also is the vice-captain of the Great Britain squad, yesterday
gave ``heavy work commitments'' as one of the reasons behind her decision, but
also pointed out ``with Great Britain now through to the Olympic Games in
Atlanta, this is going to be the most important year in my career and I want to
concentrate on the Olympics.''
Edinburgh Ladies, for whom Robertson plays indoors, will also be without her
services for the European Club Championship finals in Bratislavia.
The Edinburgh club won all their three games at the Bells Sports Centre in
Perth on Saturday, but it was Western Klick Photopoint, playing the better
hockey on the day, who richly deserved to top the table after the first session
on goal difference.

EMMA Carrick-Anderson's American dream continued yesterday in the glories of
Winter Park, Colorado, when she won a NorAm giant slalom against top-class
opposition to make her best world-ranking points score of the season so far.
After a breathtaking first run, later described by coach Kurt Scherl as the
best run he has seen her ski since he started work with her three years ago,
she was an almost uncatchable 1.7 seconds in front. A safe second run allowed
her a one-second winning margin.
``This was Emma at her best. She skied like this in the summer in training and
now it looks like she might be able to convert this type of world-class
performance to race day,'' said Scherl yesterday.
With three top-ten results from her last three outings, Carrick-Anderson races
a short series of further NorAms and FIS races before returning to Europe later
this week to compete in the rescheduled World Cup races, at Lech in Austria.
Carrick-Anderson travelled yesterday to Loveland, where she added another
victory - in the NorAm slalom, by 1.5sec over the two runs, beating Katerine
Tichie, who is ranked in the world's top 15 in slalom.

SATURDAY was stalemate day in England, with those pools coupons draws that were
missing from the Scottish premier division popping up in the English
equivalent. Eight matches produced only two winners, in Blackburn Rovers and
the newly revived Manchester City.
Blackburn's ability to knock over domestic opposition at Ewood Park remains
unchanged.
Like Rangers, they have been found out in Europe, but unlike the Scottish
champions, they can do nothing right away from home, where their record is two
draws and three goals from eight matches.
West Ham were the latest to suffer at the ground that Jack (Walker) built, as
Alan Shearer collected his third hat trick in as many months there.
Gerry Creaney is becoming Manchester City's super-sub, heading another valuable
goal after having come on just before half-time at Leeds. That one won the
game, extending City's improved run to four wins and a draw in five matches.
Liverpool's fourth successive home defeat was on the cards at Anfield when Neil
Shipperley gave Southampton the lead on Saturday but Stan Collymore's first
goal since September prevented that ignominy.
Manchester United also were held at home, something they must have feared in
view of Chelsea's excellent record at Old Trafford. Alex Ferguson spoke of a
hoodoo after John Spencer, returning after injury, had set up Dennis Wise for
an opening goal that David Beckham eventually equalised.
Another former Ibrox striker, Mark Hateley, made his debut at last for Queen's
Park Rangers, adding useful aerial strength. Hateley had one header cleared off
the line and set up Alan McDonald's goal with another. In between,
Middlesbrough's Chris Morris had put the visitors ahead, and that, eventually,
was another drawn game.
So was the meeting of two high-fliers at Villa Park, David Platt scoring for
Arsenal against his old club before Dwight Yorke replied. And Nottingham
Forest, who take a 1-0 lead to Lyon in the UEFA Cup tomorrow, also finished
1-1, thanks to Colin Cooper's late effort at Bolton.
If there was a lack of goals and excitement in the Premiership, romance was
missing, too, from the FA Cup second round. Of the seven non-league clubs drawn
against Endsleigh League opposition, not one even managed to score.
The first division, meanwhile, remains as contrary as ever, three of the
erstwhile top four losing at home and the other, Leicester City, requiring a
last-minute equaliser to hold Barnsley. Leicester are confident of holding
manager Mark McGhee to his contract rather than allowing him to escape to
Wolves, who want him to replace Graham Taylor.
A Martin Scott penalty against Crystal Palace yesterday was enough for
Sunderland to jump up six places to join Millwall at the top of the
division.

THE Camanachd Association's Executive Council meet in Fort William tonight to
discuss the appointment of the game's first full-time official.
The meeting was called after the confirmation that the President, Duncan
Cameron of Glasgow, was to be one of the candidates, along with the current
part-time official Alister MacIntyre of Fort William.
The Association's past president, Ken Thomson, took over Cameron's duties in
supervising the selection process, which advanced as scheduled on Friday when a
short-leet was drawn up.
Mr Thomson will brief the executive tonight on the progress so far. He said:
``I will also be taking the opportunity to clarify certain matters and will put
proposals to the meeting which hopefully will ensure that we will be able to
appoint an official of the highest calibre.''
It is expected that details of the short-leet may be issued in advance of the
final selection meeting, which is due to be held on Friday.
With play in the national premier league due to resume again this weekend,
Kingussie emphasised once again that they are the team to beat against
first-division Lochaber in the Keyline MacAulay Cup, netting 13 times.
Kingussie now await the outcome of the replay between Fort William and
Newtonmore.

CRICKET:
SECOND TEST
MIKE Atherton jogged out to the National Anthem - and trudged back
seven-and-half-hours later with the sound of premature South African victory
songs ringing in his ears in Johannesburg yesterday.
England had asked for a recording of God Save Our Queen to be played in a bid
to lift their spirits when they took the field in the morning. But, it seems,
not even another undefeated innings from the captain will be enough to spare
this team from eventual defeat.
Atherton battled through 71 overs for 82 runs out of a total of 167 for four.
But South Africa's supporters were convinced last night that their side is
certain of victory provided Johannesburg's weather stays fair for one more day.
They need six more wickets, have another 90 overs in which to get them, and a
second Test that has been going against England since Atherton and manager Ray
Illingworth decided to field first, now is within Springbok reach.
So long as the captain remains, hope of a great escape is not lost. But it will
need the finest innings even he has played for his country plus long and loyal
support from Robin Smith - his last fully fledged batting partner - to keep
Allan Donald and his friends at bay.
Donald struck the final significant blow of day four by capturing his 100th
Test wicket when Graeme Hick made contact outside off stump to give keeper Dave
Richardson a straightforward catch. But the main damage was done by Brian
McMillan, who followed an unbeaten 100 by dismissing Alec Stewart and Mark
Ramprakash in the space of three deliveries.
England - set 479 to win (73 more than any country has made during a successful
fourth innings run chase throughout 120 years of Test cricket) - were making
encouraging progress at 75 for nought.
But then McMillan shattered an air of calm by uprooting Stewart's middle stump
as the vice-captain drove outside a long half-volley.
Suddenly, South African fans among a capacity crowd of 30,000 found their
voices again. Ramprakash's winter was resting on what happened next - and
everyone seemed to know it.
He survived an lbw appeal first ball but the next was a near carbon copy of
Stewart's . . . and it had the same devastating result. More devastating, in
all probability, from Ramprakash's point of view for it is hard to see how
England can stand by him after three consecutive Test failures this winter and
a long record of under-achievement.
Graham Thorpe, followed Atherton's lead, hanging around for two hours. But when
he missed a straight one from Meyrick Pringle to fall lbw and, soon after, Hick
gave Donald his milestone wicket, England were in sharp decline.
However, the captain refused to budge. Smith, who might have been run out after
having turned for a non-existant second, kept him company for 57 minutes to the
close but a mountain must still be climbed.
If they reach the top of it still in one piece their hosts could regret batting
on for so long.
South Africa had established an unassailable lead of 428 by the time they
accepted an offer for bad light on Saturday evening. It was as though they
wanted to make England suffer as long as possible.

St Mirren 1, Dundee 2
DON'T bet against Dundee topping the first division tomorrow night with a
smash-and-grab act that was honed to an art form at the weekend.
Experience counted. Their ageing back four in particular know how to protect a
slender lead and keep three points.
When under the cosh - as they were for half-an-hour at Love Street - they dig
in, keep it tight. No-one does it better than 36-year-old player-manager Jim
Duffy. Somehow he managed to forget the boardroom wrangles and play with a
dogged determination that was frightening in its intensity and an inspiration
to his comrades.
``It's been a hard week,'' he said later, the master of understatement
following a Coca-Cola Cup final defeat and the proposed management takeover of
Dundee which hinges around him.
Even then his thoughts were of the players. ``They are fragile creatures
sometimes,'' he said.
But his counterpart Jimmy Bone was rattled. St Mirren were two down within 18
minutes, killing the game regardless of a spirited fightback which probably
merited at least a draw.
Bone conceded later: ``You can't give teams starts, especially good teams.''
Saints keeper Campbell Money, back for the first time since August after a
hernia operation, risked another rupture within two minutes when he had to pick
the ball out of the net.
The goal underlined the difference in the sides. Morten Wieghorst waltzed
through Saints' young defence, makeshift because of injuries. His shot was
palmed out by Money - to George Shaw, who scored from four yards. Wieghorst,
who had a fine game, later hit the woodwork with a 20-yard volley.
The goal put the fizz back in Dundee after the Coca-Cola flop. Paul Tosh netted
the second from 12 yards. There should have been a third via a super through
ball from Ian Anderson. But Shaw and Jim Hamilton, clear through, seemed to
question who should take control and Hamilton eventually shot weakly, straight
at the keeper.
But Saints rallied, with Martin Baker hitting the bar from 25 yards, in an
open, passing game which was also clean regardless of six bookings - including
two in bizarre circumstances. Hamilton was yellow carded for leaving the field
without permission, and his replacement Gerry Britton suffered the same fate
for going on too soon.
The antics were watched by Rangers' John Brown, who denied he was on a spying
mission. The former Dens Park player said he was there only ``to see old faces
. . . and there's none older than Jim Duffy's.''
Brown left with eight minutes to go, immune to the hurly-burly finish.
A change of referee at the start of the second half, because of a pulled
muscle, coincided with a change in mood. Saints now had grit. Front-runners
Barry Lavety and Mark Yardley gave the Duffys - Jim and Neil - a hard time.
Lavety got his reward in 69 minutes after the ball broke his way in the penalty
box from a splendid Brian Hetherston run from midfield.
Michel Pageaud then produced a series of remarkable saves. One fingertip stop
from Yardley in 77 minutes deserved the hyperbole from the manager later.
Dundee brought on Gary McKeown for the second half, his first game for 14
months after horrendous cruciate ligament damage. McKeown, who finally had an
operation in January and has faced daily hospital visits for the past seven
months, said: ``It's been a long road. At times I felt I would never play
again.
``For me, the season starts now.''
Duffy declined to talk about the #3m deal that would see Canadian millionaire
Ron Dixon leave and put the manager and Dundee vice-chairman Malcolm Reid in
control of the club.
Instead, he looked forward to tomorrow's home game with Dumbarton, and added
only: ``I cannot be unhappy after the week we have had. And we could be top of
the table on Tuesday.''
Bone was disappointed with the result, but remains optimistic. He expects soon
to have a full squad to choose from. Norrie McWhirter and Jamie Fullerton are
likely to play for the reserves on Wednesday.
``I was pleased with our approach to the game, and the injury list is clearing
up. That creates pressure for places, with the young ones in on merit,'' said
Bone.
Brian Hetherston, 19, in particular was ``breathtaking, exciting.'' He was also
booked on Saturday for dissent, although Bone claimed later it was a case of
mistaken identity, with Lavety to blame for speaking out of turn. ``I don't
know if they will use video evidence,'' joked Bone.

BATTLE-scarred Pete Sampras clinched the Davis Cup for the United States by
sinking Yevgeny Kafelnikov in straight sets in Moscow yesterday.
Sampras, urgently needing a quick victory because of a hamstring problem,
downed Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4, 7-6, ending the final emphatically with an ace to
hand the Americans their first title since 1992.
It was the Wimbledon champion's third victory of the weekend, and gave the US
an insurmountable 3-1 lead in the best-of-five final, rendering meaningless the
final singles match between Jim Courier and Andrei Chesnokov.
Sampras, who was carried off court with cramp after beating Andrei Chesnokov in
a five-set thriller on Friday, was in ``ace'' form as he crushed the world No.6
in just more than two hours.
It was the Russians' second home defeat in an Olympic Stadium final in
successive years. A sometimes boisterous crowd of 14,000 had cheered them on
but they are now left still seeking their first cup.
The Russians had installed a red clay court last month especially to slow down
the powerful Sampras, whose record on clay is unspectacular.
But ``Pistol Pete'' had acted as if it were his favourite surface all weekend,
outlasting Chesnokov in a gruelling match on Friday that saw him collapse with
leg cramps, and then overwhelming the opposition in straight sets in Saturday's
doubles and yesterday's finale.
Sampras lost only four points in his first eight service games, reeling off 11
points in a row during one stretch of the second set as his cheering
team-mates, including Andre Agassi, were on their feet to cheer him on. He
survived the hamstring injury through a tense third set.
Sampras said later he had played his best clay-court tennis in beating
Kafelnikov.
Sampras paid tribute to captain Tom Gullikson. ``It is a great win for the team
and I am happy for Tom.''
He said he had thought during the match of Tim Gullikson who used to coach
Sampras until taken ill last year. ``It has been a tough year for both of us
dealing with Tim's situation,'' Sampras added.
Kafelnikov, mindful of Sampras' cramp attack, said he wanted to keep him on
court for as long as possible.
``I felt the third set was very important and if I had won it the match could
have gone the other way as Pete looked tired.''

JIM Leishman's proposed project whereby full-time Livingston FC players will be
coaching in local primary schools seems an excellent initiative.
This valuable link between school and community can bring benefits to all
concerned, especially the pupils. Basic skills and techniques can be developed
and positive attitudes towards the sport encouraged, which hopefully will
motivate the youngsters to continue playing the sport.
However, adults coaching young performers must be aware that their charges are
not mini-adults performing under adult conditions and standards.
Coaching approaches must be sensitive to the needs of the developing child in a
number of areas.
Too many coaches and parents ignore, or are ignorant of, the mental, physical,
and technical factors which require to be considered when coaching and working
with young performers.
Playing sport should be a fun experience for young people, where enjoyment is
the first priority.
A desire to improve basic skills and techniques should develop through this
enjoyment. This can be achieved by adopting appropriate coaching styles and
methods which put enjoyment at the top of the coach's agenda.
The pressure of competition should be reduced and qualities of team play and
fair play emphasised. Adult pressure often leads to children developing a
negative attitude to sport, which often results in the child giving up sport.
I sincerely hope that those responsible for planning and managing the
Livingston FC initiative will ensure that the players working with the children
will be suitably prepared for this very responsible task.
The players concerned will also have to realise that they will become role
models, with the responsibility which this involves.
I hope that other sports clubs throughout Scotland will recognise the valuable
potential for this type of initiative in forging links which will benefit young
people in sport and the community.

A SEASONAL tale. There has been, so far, a marked absence of a bright light in
the heavens but this week three wise men will alight on these shores, not out
of the East but from the deep South.
There is a Moon among them, but no sign of a guiding star, and even though
Christmas is fast approaching, whether they will bring with them gold,
frankincense, and myrrh remains yet to be seen. The jury is out, too, on
whether or not they will be wise.
We are witnessing the first real, discernible signs of player power. In England
and Wales, the clubs have already rattled their corporate sabres and rattled,
too, the dovecots at Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park. The premier English
clubs have formed their own limited company and you can bet your bottom dollar
that, once broadcast contracts come up for negotiation, they will be demanding
a much greater slice of the financial action.
Now, a new force is abroad in the land. RUPA, the Rugby Union Players'
Association, is about to set up shop, with Richard Moon, Peter Winterbottom,
and Bob Norster at the helm. They are due in Scotland this week, where Keith
Robertson, the former Melrose and Scotland threequarter, is keen to set up a
series of meetings.
The intention is that they will hold talks with SRU senior vice-president Fred
McLeod, the chairman of the premier clubs' association David Kilshaw, Gavin
Hastings in his Hastings International marketing mode, and Rob Wainwright,
Craig Chalmers, and Scott Hastings, the three player reps on the International
Players' Trust.
At the weekend, Moon - a lawyer, ex-Saracens, and brother of Rupert - was
declaring that RUPA were the only impartial operators ``out there''. Out there
being the brave new world of professional rugby where the wide-boys are even
now queueing up to carve out their pound of flesh.
``We are the only independent voice for the players,'' he says. Professional
footballers have their own trade union, if you like, with Tony Higgins in
charge in Scotland, so it was inevitable that as one of the apparent
accoutrements of the professional game, rugby should get one, too.
Hitherto, the view from Murrayfield might well have been one of consternation.
The natives are revolting, they might have said, but are, perhaps, less likely
to do so now. In any event, it is yet another file which will land with a thump
on the desk of director of rugby Jim Telfer.
Sometimes, before I lay me down of a night, I thank the Lord that I'm not Jim
Telfer. And sometimes I think that the good Lord must thank himself that he's
not Jim Telfer as well. Actually, I don't believe in the concept of a
metaphysical supreme being. But existentialism (and this I can state without
fear of contradiction, is a Herald Sport first) is another philosophical
doctrine altogether.
You knew this already, of course, but existentialists believe that people -
even rugby players - are moral free agents who must create values for
themselves through their own deeds and must accept the ultimate responsibility
for those actions in the seemingly meaningless universe.
Kenny Logan and I often while away an evening mulling over existentialism and
related philosophical doctrines. I have come to the conclusion that, as Supreme
Beings go, then in Scotland Jim Telfer is about as close as you can get without
crossing over to the other side.
Existentialist players as free agents in a post-Thatcherite free market? In my
book that's a recipe for chaos.
And let us, for a moment, return to reality. The word is that clubs have
started recruiting for next season already. The premiership is not yet over but
already the feelers are going out and a price if being levied on club loyalty.
Before very much longer we must have a properly thought out and regulated
transfer system in place. When can clubs approach players and how should the
approaches be made? Should there be transfer fees? If the answer is yes then is
there a role for agents? Will expatriates in England be given leave to play for
their districts in Scotland?
And, just what is myrrh anyway?

Falkirk 2, Raith Rovers 1
PAUL McGrillen has come through the pain game since joining Falkirk from
Motherwell last season. His cruciate injury was the one which halted his
progress, followed by a stress fracture which did not help his chance of an
early comeback.
After this match at Brockville - in which McGrillen scored both home goals -
Falkirk manager John Lambie had a stress fracture of the mind, while his Raith
Rovers counterpart was in a daze - the ``I cannot believe it'' syndrome.
Lambie's opening remark, as he searched for some tobacco relief, was: ``Ma
hert's still tickin'.'' This was followed by the thoughts of a man under the
type of pressure which had a couple of his contemporaries in the news recently.
``We were so bad in the first half - and we began it really well - that I was
desperate for the whistle to end it.'' The next question was obvious. ``Did you
have words with the players at half-time?''
Reply: ``I had to give them a rollicking. We were not competing. Raith Rovers
are good side, especially at creating movement.''
The rollicking seemed to work, while Raith lost their way. ``We were caught
sleeping for their winner,'' was all that a stunned Jimmy Nicholl could admit.
``We had so much of that game.''
Whereas Lambie had made his views clear to his players, Nicholl could only
admit: ``The way the players have been performing, I could say nothing to them.
That's our first defeat in five games, and they did little wrong.''
Now to McGrillen. ``It has been a frustrating six or seven months, but I feel I
am sharper now. Amazingly, my only three goals this season have been against
Raith - I scored the winner at Stark's Park.''
They were also the first goals conceded by Raith in five games - and two in
seven minutes at that, as first he fired home from close range after a
scramble, and then he took advantage of a fine run by Mo Johnston to touch home
a David Hagen knock-back.
The ``handful'' as described by Lambie - striker Ally Graham, to Raith
supporters - knocked home a fine equaliser. Even then, he needed two chances as
keeper Tony Parks blocked his first effort.
Around all the second-half mayhem that followed a disappointing first half in
which Raith were in command, the ball had paint on it several times as it hit
posts, crossbars, or even the stand roof - and on one occasion, it disappeared
into the night sky from a Raith clearance.
The final remark of Lambie said much: ``I don't want just a football team, I
want one with wee bit of devilment in it.''
The Brockville side's move up the premier division a couple of places might get
the message through to the players - and with the continuing battle of Lambie
to ``find a couple of fresh faces,'' the competition will hot up in the
dressing room as well as in the league.

ABERDEEN will fine captain Stewart McKimmie for the elbowing incident which
earned him a red card against Partick Thistle at Firhill.
Manager Roy Aitken broke off from yesterday's civic reception to honour the
Pittodrie club's Coca-Cola Cup triumph to reveal that disciplinary action will
be taken. McKimmie will be fined #500 for the offence which was blamed for the
Dons defeat.
But Aitken insisted: ``It was a very uncharacteristic thing for McKimmie to do
and obviously he will pay the price. He will be disciplined under our own code.
But it was a one-off from a player who is a very well-respected professional
within the game.
``There is no doubt that losing such a player after just nine minutes cost us
the game. The rest of the players battled very hard but the extra man Partick
Thistle had eventually told.''
McKimmie, the last link to Aberdeen's golden era of the last decade, was not
permitted to discuss the incident.
The Scotland star's gloom was forgotten as thousands of supporters turned out
in driving rain to line the streets of the city and celebrate the first cup
victory in five years.
All their Hampden heroes were aboard an open-top bus which took more than two
hours to reach the Town House through the packed streets.
Aitken added: ``This is the first time in my career that I have been able to go
among the supporters en masse after winning a competition. It is a very special
day for me and this club.
``It does not surprise me that so many of our fans turned out despite the
dreadful conditions. They have been invaluable to us over the last seven or
eight months and given our players a great lift. There is a real buzz in the
city nowadays and I'd like to thank them all for getting behind us.
``I just hope this is the first of many more days like this. But there is a lot
of hard work still to be done.''
q.AYR goalkeeper Cammy Duncan is recovering at home after a horrific accident
in which he swallowed his tongue. Duncan was hurt in a collision with David
Kennedy of Queen of the South during Ayr's 2-0 first-division victory on
Saturday.
The 30-year-old former Partick Thistle keeper swallowed his tongue in the
incident and it took prompt action by the Ayr physio John Kerr to save him.
``John pulled his tongue out as soon as he got to him and that probably saved
Cammy's life,'' said Ayr manager Gordon Dalziel.
``Our club doctor decided at the interval that although Cammy had played on, we
should not send him back      out.
``Instead he went to hospital to be checked out, because we do not want to take
a risk with his health.
``In the event we are all relieved that he got the go-ahead to return home and
to drink plenty of fluids over the next few days. We will keep a close watch on
him.''

Celtic 4, Kilmarnock 2
NOT being one of the natives, Pierre van Hooydonk may be unaware of Burns (the
bard, not the manager), but, after Celtic's remarkable recovery, he gave a
pretty accurate description of Rabbie's perception of what
happens to the best laid plans.
The Dutchman, scorer of two goals against the luckless Killie, explained that
he and his colleagues had talked before the game of getting a good start,
scoring early, and getting the crowd behind them.
``Then it went wrong, they scored, we couldn't get going, and nobody wanted
the
ball,'' he said, ``but after half-time everybody wanted the ball. That was
the
difference.''
Pierre is also beginning to understand the Scottish football critics'
mentality.
``I think it is quite usual in Scotland that when a foreigner first comes here
they look at his good points, but after a couple of weeks they must find
things
to criticise. But Andreas (Thom) and I can handle that.''
Thom, sitting beside his loquacious colleague, does not have the same command
of English but he was able to get across the message that the Parkhead team is
determined to keep Rangers    in their sights as the championship race
progresses.
Although van Hooydonk was the sponsors' man of the match, many of us thought
Thom had even greater influence on the day's events, while Tommy Burns
reckoned
Peter Grant was the outstanding player of the day.
The divergence of opinion might illustrate how well Celtic played later on but
for most of the first half they had looked like a team going through the
motions.
``I think we started nervously,'' was how Thom put it. He didn't explain why
but, whatever the cause, the Kilmarnock team soon sensed that they had a real
chance of delighting the bookies.
When Ally Mitchell scored their first goal, after Gordon Marshall had dropped
a
Tom Black cross, although he did seem to be impeded by Mitchell, the vast
majority of the 33,812 on site was reduced to mild annoyance but, when Tom
Brown headed in the second, there was something akin to apoplexy in the stands.
By then, Burns admitted, he was thinking up expletives in preparation for his
half-time dressing-room admonishment. He then had to pack them away for
another
day as his players conjured up two goals inside a minute, both of which
infuriated Killie manager Alex Totten, who could not believe his side would
collapse in such dramatic fashion.
Paul Wright was guilty of dithering when he lost the ball to Thom, although he
might have been fouled in the process, and the next moment the German had laid
the ball on the head of Grant.
There was virtually no time for the Ayrshire lot to regather as van Hooydonk
played the sweetest of passes to Thom, who took his time before hitting the
equaliser. The mugged had got up and belted the muggers.
There was really no way out for Killie then. Two goals up on Celtic at
Parkhead
and controlling the game, they will never have a better chance of making a
name for themselves.
Celtic, having come alive, then gave their supporters a treat, scoring two
more
goals, each by van Hooydonk.
The first was a well-worked 1-2 with Simon Donnelly and the second an easy
task
after brilliant play by Thom and John Collins.
The party was in full swing, with Celtic playing the knockabout game to such
effect that, on one occasion, they made more than 30 passes before Kilmarnock
intervened, and that was with a foul that earned Derek Anderson a booking.
``Without disrespect to Kilmarnock, we have to beat teams like them at home if
we are to keep in the championship,'' said van Hooydonk, who admitted that
before the season even began he had anticipated a two-horse race with Rangers.
That, in his view, is progress for Celtic. ``There is a hell of a difference
from last season, although we still have a lot to learn. But we are trying to
play football all the time.''
Burns thought Grant was ``immense'' but now has to think about picking a team
without him and John Hughes, as both are suspended for the next three matches.
Phil O'Donnell should be about ready to return by the weekend, however, to
slot
into the midfield, while he has plenty of options in the heart of defence,
with Rudi Vata or Malcolm Mackay ready to come in.
For Totten, the day that had begun so thrillingly ended in abject
disappointment. He left out Wright for the second half, although indicating it
was only because he wanted to try Colin McKee's pace up front, and he clearly
was very angry at the way the two goals were lost just before the break.
``There are times when you play football and times when you clear your
lines,''
he said. ``For more than 40 minutes Kilmarnock showed that they are as good
as
any team in the league but you can't give away goals like that. We laid it on
a plate for Celtic.''

MATT Dawson showed all the skills of the scrum-half art and moved nearer a
first cap by masterminding Midlands' 40-19 demolition of Western Samoa at
Leicester on Saturday.
England manager Jack Rowell and two other selectors watched Northampton's
Dawson play the game of his life and were left to compare his performance with
that of Kyran Bracken in the Test defeat by South Africa last month. They will
announce their verdict on the scrum-half place for the Test against Western
Samoa later this week.
Dawson, who was within a physio's diagnosis of a cap when Bracken was injured
on his debut two years ago, said: ``With that sort of game I am saying to the
selectors `here is what I can do'.
``If you like the way I play, I can do that job for England. I want to be
chosen on my merits.
``We go for variety at Northampton and it has been very successful in the
second division. But we still needed to prove to everybody that we could do it
against international opposition.''
Dawson linked up with club colleague and Midlands captain Tim Rodber. They
helped each other to a try each and provided the variety of different types of
kicks, breaks and service to the other backs.
Flanker Rodber, who admitted that he should have come off earlier in the
Springbok Test with his bruised arm, proved his fitness and renewed hunger, and
temporarily silenced criticism from former international colleagues.
``Dawson and Paul Grayson organised the whole thing and this was the way
England should play against Western Samoa at Twickenham,'' said Rodber.
``We united the best of the Northampton and Leicester styles and did everything
we wanted to.''
Western Samoa's tour is in trouble, despite their draw with Scotland and two
big midweek wins. Their Saturday side, bulging with Test players, has endured
two defeats.
The tourists' defence was easily opened up and their scrum conceded two penalty
tries as they were being shunted back over their own line.
Matt Allen scored Midlands' other try. Grayson kicked three penalties and three
conversions, and struck woodwork with two more.
The Pacific Islanders came late with tries from Mark Birtwistle, Too Vaega, and
Alex Telea, with a couple of conversions from Darren Kellett.
Meanwhile, in Cork, South African tourists Transvaal overcame the sending-off
in 56 minutes of tight-head prop Kapstok Van Greuning for punching to earn a
draw with reigning Irish provincial champions Munster in a cracking game.
The South Africans, beaten last week by Leinster in Dublin, clinched the tie
with an unconverted try in injury time from centre Christiaan Scholtz. Indeed,
they should have won, but full back Joe Gillingham missed the easy conversion.
Munster fly-half Paul Burke opened the scoring with a penalty after 13 minutes,
but two minutes later full back Joe Gillingham equalised with a similar effort.
Burke landed his second penalty after 28 minutes but Gillingham tied the scores
after 60 minutes with his second penalty.
The South African side then took the lead when right wing Ip van der Merwe
crossed for an unconverted try at the start of the final quarter.
But Munster hit back, Burke kicking his third penalty and then converting an
excellent try by lock Mike Coughlan to give Munster a 16-11 lead with six
minutes left, only for Scholtz to snatch the equalising try from a tapped
penalty.

Scottish Exiles Under-21s 24,
South of Scotland Under-21s 8
THE South of Scotland met an Exiles side at Richmond who proved to have too
much in the way of power and pace, and ultimately ran out convincing winners of
a match which came to life only in the second half.
The watching Scotland coach, David Leslie, was running the rule over Exile
captain and fly half McKee, and he must have been impressed with the Cardiff
Institute student's performance, which included three penalty goals and a
superb individual try.
The first of his kicks in the fifth minute opened the scoring, and while the
South backs impressed with their handling in tight spaces, solid Exile tackling
ensured the first South score came from the boot of Selkirk outside half Alan
Clark in the twenty-fourth minute. Of the busy Exile flankers, McIntosh
particularly shone as a stocky open side.
McKee added two further kicks either side of the half-hour, and the quiet first
half was brightened in 36 minutes when the powerful Renfrew shot through the
South's porous defence to send in right wing Reed for the try.
While the gloom at the Athletic ground deepened, a veil seemed to lift from the
players after the break and they resumed with heightened intent.
The Exiles worked full back Munroe outside the cover on the left only to see
him hauled down two yards short. From the lineout, a ruck formed infield and
McKee burst down a broad blind-side corridor to round the defence and score.
Feeling the pressure of time, the South threequarters took to the wide open
spaces but it was 25 minutes into the half before the South finally linked a
set of drives with some quick handling and with the Exiles stretched, Kelso
scrum half Graham Cowe shot away from a ruck and scuttled 20 metres to score.
Three minutes later the Exiles rounded off the scoring as Sale centre Farrow
chipped through and Renfrew scored a deserved try in the corner.
Exiles - W Munroe (Newcastle); S Reed (Nottingham), A Farrow (Sale), M Glen
(Wakefield), G Renfrew (Leeds); J McKee (Cardiff Institute), D MacKenzie
(Leicester); C Ambrose (Blackheath), G Hodgeson (Newcastle), J Kelly
Harlequins), P Holmes, S Spensley (both Loughborough University), J McIntosh
(Birmingham), R Marsh (Bristol University), G MacCallum (Sandbach).

SUDDEN Spin, a useful horse to have in a lowly grade, can show the benefit of
his recent reappearance at Uttoxeter by winning the Gorebridge Conditional
Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle for Steve Norton today at Edinburgh.
A fair performer on the Flat for Jack Berry a couple of years ago, Sudden Spin
showed little promise during his first season over hurdles for Vivien Aconley.
But he appears to have strengthened since his arrival at Norton's Barnsley
stable, which is reflected by an upturn in his fortunes.
On his reappearance over hurdles last term, he produced a gutsy effort to win a
seller at Catterick, and was far from disgraced back there in a similar event
next time out.
Once again at Catterick, he regained the winning thread in selling company with
a four-length defeat of Friendly Knight.
His successes have not been restricted to the National Hunt side of the sport,
with three victories on the all-weather in 1995, the last being when landing a
handicap over a mile and a furlong at Wolverhampton.
His return to action over jumps at Uttoxeter gave every indication that he is
primed for another victory.
This time lining up for a non-selling event, he still had a firm hold of his
bridle when moving up to challenge with two flights remaining but could do no
more from soon after, going down by three-and-a-half lengths to Elflaa.
That run will have put him straight and Sudden Spin is napped to go one better.
The Stan Mellor-trained Bone Setter has shown fair form in his first season
over fences and is taken to win the Stokesay Novices' Chase at Ludlow.

TENNENTS NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUND-UP
GLENROTHES stay targeted for the Premiership with a 38-16 home win over lowly
Dunfermline. An even first half saw them 8-6 ahead with the try coming in just
22 seconds from winger Jonathan Goldie. With the advantage of the slope, Ralph
Henderson, Brian Delorey, and Andy Grieve touched down before young Goldie
scored again - his seventeenth try of the season.
With Hillhead/Jordanhill going under 16-12 at Portobello, Stewartry go clear in
second place. A try from Den Smith, converted by Alan Freeman, gave Portobello
a 13-3 half-time lead. In last week's defeat, Hills missed many penalties - on
Saturday they ran them instead, to no greater effect.
A converted try from Trinity's Gordon Miller tied the score at Stewartry on
22-22 with five minutes left. However, an unconverted try from Davie Fulton,
added to those from Sandy Craig and Jimmy McGill, won it for the home side.
East Kilbride stay top of Division Two thanks to a comprehensive 56-8 win in
the Lanarkshire derby at Dalziel. Aberdeen GSFP maintain thir second place
after living dangerously at bottom club Howe of Fife. Two penalties from Brian
Simmons from four excursions into the Howe half gave Grammar FPs the interval
lead. With two minutes left Howe's flanker Mike Black scored but Robbie
Gilmour's conversion faded away.
Cambuslang lie third, coming back from a 10-8 interval deficit to beat
Perthshire 11-10. Alan Stark for Cambus and Gavin Brown were the try scorers
but two Iain Thomson penalties made the difference.
Hutchesons'/Aloysians pulled away from Livingston with a scrappy 19-9 win at
Auldhouse. A tremendous run by lock John MacDonald set up Paolo Bardelli's
early try. Euan Baillie's was a late gift.
Third-division table-toppers Berwick won 27-14 at Cumbernauld and are now the
only unbeaten National League side.
Allan Glen's won 30-10 at lowly Highland thanks to tries from Chris Hughes, Jim
McParland, and Alistair Robertson. Taking advantage of Cartha QP's home slip,
they move into second place.
Two tries from Gary Grant gave Cartha a 15-12 lead over Alloa after 45 minutes.
Alan Imrie's try put Alloa ahead again and despite Grant's being twice over the
line, they held on for a 19-15 success.
Early tries from Alaister Graham, Stuart Williamson, and Mark Hollis sent Annan
to an eight-try 51-3 home win over Division Four leaders Lismore, allowing
Clydebank to take over the top spot, courtesy of a 29-0 win at Falkirk.
q ENGLAND'S new hooker Mark Regan faces an anxious wait before discovering
whether he will be cleared to face Western Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday week
after collecting his second yellow card of the season on Saturday.
Bristol forward Regan was cautioned by London referee Ray Merloo for an
off-the-ball challenge on Moseley centre Bob Massey.
However, as Gloucestershire's disciplinary committee have a backlog of cases,
his hearing is unlikely to take place before the international.
Regan, who won his first cap against South Africa two weeks ago, received his
first yellow card in the Courage League One game against Saracens in September.
England's team for the Western Samoan international will be announced on
Wednesday.

SECOND DIVISION
KEVIN Drinkell was understandably happy on Saturday as his Stirling Albion team
strolled to a 4-1 home win over Forfar. ``That was the best I've seen them play
for a while,'' he observed.
Albion not only entertained the crowd - they are probably the best footballing
team in the division, although still six points behind East Fife - but had
goals to show for it, too.
``We used the width of the pitch well,'' Drinkell reflected, and even excused
the loss of a soft late goal to Mark Bowes as demonstrating that Albion try to
avoid negative play.
Within half-an-hour, a David Woods cross provided Ian McInnes, quickly followed
by Steve McCormick converting an Alex Bone cut-back. On the hour, Ronnie
McQuilter tapped in from a corner before McCormick rounded the keeper for the
fourth.
A Mark Donaghy shot almost on half-time was enough to end East Fife's four-game
winless home run at the expense of Berwick.
Miller Mathieson struck twice and made one for Gareth Hutchison in
Stenhousemuir's 4-1 win at Montrose, while goals by Mark Smith and Tommy Steele
gave Ayr their second straight home win and let them leapfrog over visitors,
Queen of the South.
Stranraer and Clyde, unsurprisingly, finished goalless at Stair Park.

AUSTRALIA captain and opener Mark Taylor survived a torrid spell by Pakistan
leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed in Sydney yesterday to leave the third and final Test
evenly balanced as the home side chased 247 runs for victory.
Taylor remained unbeaten on 49 after Australia had lost two early wickets in
their second innings.
At the close on the fourth day, Australia were 121 for three, needing another
126 runs to complete a clean sweep of the series. The hosts scored 257 in their
first innings in reply to Pakistan's 299.
The tourists, who relied almost entirely on a spin attack of Mushtaq and
off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, made a breakthrough just before yesterday's close
when captain and fast bowler Wasim Akram had Mark Waugh caught behind by Rashid
Latif.
The tourists, seeking to restore morale after heavy defeats in the first two
Tests, were jubilant at Waugh's dismissal for 34 after having wasted several
chances to take a firmer grip on the match.
Even with seven wickets in hand, Australia must contend with a pitch offering
significant turn and uneven bounce for the spinners in today's run chase.
Pakistan lost their last five wickets for just 19 runs yesterday to slump to
204 all out in their second innings.
In reply, Mushtaq's one success came in his sixth over when he trapped opener
Michael Slater for 23 with the total on 42. Slater did not play a shot on the
back foot and was struck on the pads by a ball that moved back from outside his
off-stump.
David Boon fell to Saqlain for six when the ball deflected off the back of his
bat to give substitute fielder, Moin Khan, a catch at silly point.
Earlier in the day, fast bowler Craig McDermott had taken five for 49, his best
Test performance in Sydney, as Pakistan struggled for runs after resuming on
101 for four.
Inzamam-ul-Haq, batting at No.6 because of a shoulder injury sustained while
fielding, scored 59 before becoming one of McDermott's victims.

Partick Thistle 1, Aberdeen 0
WHAT a difference a week makes in football. At Hampden last Sunday, there was
Stewart McKimmie hoisting aloft the Coca-Cola Cup to signal Aberdeen's first
trophy win in five years and his own first triumph as club captain.
Those good people from the north, who have to travel further and spend more
than anyone else to follow their team, had every right to expect the dawning of
a new era.
Yet, on Saturday, on a return visit to Glasgow, McKimmie put in what was
probably his shortest-ever working shift.
He was sent off after just nine minutes at Firhill for elbowing Partick
Thistle's Callum Milne in the face, leaving a depleted side to battle uphill
for the rest of the afternoon.
The cup was paraded up Union Street in fine style yesterday, as a gesture of
thanks to the Aberdeen fans, but a more fitting thank-you would probably have
been a more responsible attitude from the club captain at Firhill - a rash
youth he is not - and three much-needed premier division points.
Manager Roy Aitken, who has done such a marvellous job in his short spell in
charge, left nobody in any doubt as to who was to blame for the defeat.
``The bottom line is that the sending off cost us the match,'' he said. ``You
spend 20 minutes in the dressing-room before the match talking about the shape
of the side, then within 10 minutes of the start you've got to change it.''
Thistle, much maligned in recent weeks, took full advantage of having an extra
man.
They had, in fact, started the match in a bright, eager mood which belied
current form, and when referee Martin Clark sent McKimmie packing, the Firhill
side really took a grip on things.
Their control in the midfield - the fact that Eoin Jess was carrying a groin
strain certainly didn't help Aberdeen - allowed defenders breathing space and
what followed was a thoroughly professional, and at times entertaining,
performance from Thistle.
Towards the end of the match, they even had a bit of a swagger about them, a
kind of arrogance which comes only through extreme confidence.
Thistle could have won more comfortably. Indeed, before Tom Smith headed the
only goal of the match from an Andy Gibson cross in 63 minutes, they had
squandered several better chances.
Said Smith, a product of Thistle's youth policy: ``I was delighted to score,
because just before that I had put two good chances past. When Andy's cross
came over I was determined to get my header on target.''
The previous week, Thistle were jeered for their performance against Raith
Rovers, but even their fiercest critic could only have admiration for them
after this showing.
in a side which didn't have a weakness, special mention must go to Milne, who
won the man of the match award.
On Saturday, he played his fourth match in eight days, and he was still going
strong at the finish.
Said Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod: ``We had a long chat after the Raith Rovers
match, and I'm delighted at the response. We can take a lot of confidence from
that performance.''

Motherwell 0, Hibernian 2
THE mood was as dark as the evening when the ball stopped rolling at Fir Park
on Saturday. These are indeed trying times for those connected with Motherwell.
The club has been successful in just one match in their past 11, and, following
this latest defeat, they are now keeping Kilmarnock company at the wrong end of
the premier division. Things can only improve.
When another Keith Wright header struck the back of the home net, it appeared
as though a signal had been given for home sections of the ground to be
evacuated, and as referee Louis Thow's whistle pierced the chill evening air
after 90 minutes there were few Motherwell fans remaining. Those still seated
hollered their disgust at the situation now enveloping the club.
As journalists mingled at the main entrance at Fir Park, words like ``crisis''
and ``critical'' could be heard, but before such a scenario is entered into a
few facts should be taken on board.
Had it not been for the agility of Hibs' keeper Jim Leighton, and if the home
strikers had had a smattering of good fortune, then all three points would not
have been lost.
In similar circumstances, some managers have been known to disappear into the
night. However, Alex McLeish, thankfully, is not such an individual.
The Motherwell manager chatted quietly about the day's proceedings and his
club's situation, and there was an air of determination about the man, a
feeling that all will be well when it matters. We'll see.
``And so it continues,'' said the big man, of his club's recent run of poor
form. ``We showed Hibs too much respect, especially in the second half,'' said
the manager.
``It is the little things that are costing us dearly. There is nothing major,
apart from the fact that we have a lot of experienced players out. If we are
not scoring, we have to keep the door shut at the other end, and we are not
doing that.''
On the subject of injuries, McLeish did not use that matter as an ``excuse''
but admitted his club's playing resources were being ``severely tested.''
However, if Motherwell's lot was not a happy one, Keith Wright exited
Lanarkshire with a large smile on his face. He opened the scoring after 51
minutes following fine work by Michael O'Neill and the Irishman again was
Wright's supplier for the concluding goal in 77 minutes.
On the negative side for Hibs, they will go about their business without
O'Neill, who must kick his heels in the stand for the next three matches
because of SFA suspension.
Life could hardly become more negative for Motherwell and, with Aberdeen and
Rangers to be faced before Christmas, it probably feels to the Motherwell
people they have perpetrated a grievous mischief in another life and are now
being repaid.
With the wealth of experience and gifted individuals on the Fir Park payroll,
matters such as being in the wrong place in the league should soon surely take
a turn for the better. Mind you, that was said of Dundee United last season,
and look what happened to them. Who would be a Motherwell fan these days?

SCULLERS Kevin Plank and Willie Brown used their knowledge of the twists and
turns of the river around Stirling to full advantage as they won yesterday's
Head of the Forth, seven seconds ahead of Clydesdale.
They were followed by lightweights Joe Kelly and Mark Hely.
The Castle Semple double of Allan Watt and Peter Murray slipped down the
rankings, crashing from bank to bank on the five-kilometre course.
Nithsdale's junior four came home ahead of their rivals from George Heriot's to
take that division, while the junior women from the Dumfries club were also
victorious. In the women's small boats events, George Watson's dominated,
taking the double and the pairs events, while Inverness won the women's senior
restricted fours division, ahead of Strathclyde University.
St Andrews University provided the fastest men's novice four of the day, while
Stirling University emerged winners of the women's novice              category.

THIRD DIVISION
THE name of Willie Watters was familiar to John Brogan in his time in charge of
Stirling Albion. Usually it was a chant from the crowd, urging him to bring the
striker on from the bench. On Saturday, the Arbroath manager had reason to be
grateful to the same Watters, writes Bill Sutherland.
The striker was expected to join Arbroath when he refused re-signing terms at
Stirling in the summer. Alloa seemed to have picked him up, only for Watters to
walk out and be reunited with Brogan at Gayfield.
On Saturday Watters popped up in the final minute to convert a Lee Gardiner
pass and seal a 2-1 home win over Cowdenbeath that let Arbroath leapfrog over
their visitors to within three points of second place. Arbroath's trialist - by
coincidence, Michael Watters - had opened the scoring, while a wind-assisted
lob by Martin Humphreys had levelled.
Livingston failed for a third time to score at their new home - the crowd this
time was 3444 - but as the visitors were second-placed Ross County, the gap at
the top remains seven points. Caley Thistle missed chances and had to settle
for a 1-1 draw at home to East Stirlingshire but Brechin fared even worse,
falling to a lob by Albion Rovers' Andy Willock.
Alloa had the better of the goalless draw at home to Queen's Park.

LIBERIAN striker George Weah showed his lethal finishing touch with a late
winner for AC Milan in their 1-0 win against Lazio yesterday in Rome, as the
league leaders opened up a four-point gap in Serie A.
But champions Juventus, inspired by a Gianluca Vialli hat trick in a 5-0
humiliation of local rivals Torino, have not given up the title hunt.
Weah, whose goals have transformed Milan's strike-rate this season, rounded off
a counterattack three minutes from time to make amends for a series of missed
chances in the first half.
Milan now top the table with 27 points from 12 matches, four ahead of Parma,
who owed their 1-1 draw at Napoli to Gianfranco Zola's second-half penalty
against his old club.
Fausto Pizzi had given the Neapolitans the lead after 38 minutes after the home
side had twice hit the woodwork.
Fiorentina moved into third place on 22 points, one behind behind Parma, after
Gabriel Batistuta's goal earned them a last-gasp win at Padova.
The Florence club were joined by newly promoted Atalanta, who notched up their
fourth successive win, 3-1 over Vicenza, with two goals from Sandro Tovalieri.
Internazionale continued their rehabilitation under English coach Roy Hodgson,
recovering from the third-minute dismissal of Gianluca Festa to defeat
Cremonese 2-0 with goals from Javier Zanetti and Maurizio Ganz.
Enrico Chiesa claimed his first hat trick as Sampdoria defeated Bari 3-1 for
their first away win of the season.
Another last-minute goal, this time from Abel Balbo, earned Roma a 1-1 draw at
his old club Udinese.

BILL Sutherland may be correct in stating that 15-year-old Sean Christie of
Forfar Athletic is younger than was Ronnie Simpson when he kept goal for
Queen's Park in 1946.
Ronnie Simpson, however, played for Queen's Park in 1945 when he was 14. His
first match was a 5-2 victory against Clyde in the Summer Cup. In the second
round, Bobby Brown kept goal in a 1-0 defeat at Greenock. Simpson came in again
for the second leg at Hampden, which was scoreless.

THE normally sedate world of bowls was rocked at the weekend after a competitor
in the National Fours Championship Playdowns was thrown out of the match after
allegedly verbally abusing an official.
Mr John McLardy, skip of the rink representing the Galleon Club in Kilmarnock,
was told not to turn up for yesterday morning's second round match with
Auchinleck after umpire Mr Roger Black had reported him to Scottish Indoor
Bowling Association officials in attendance at the Playdowns at Paisley.
The alleged incidents took place during the first round match between Galleon
and Newton Stewart which the Ayrshire side won 25-16.
Mr Black, who is also a qualified football referee and spent 20 years on the
official SFA's referee list, said: ``I spoke to the player on a couple of
occasions regarding his general conduct on the green and after the second
warning he launched a verbal attack on me within earshot of various officials
and other bowlers.
``I reported the matter to the SIBA officials' president and was later informed
the player had been disqualified from the event. I think it's an excellent
decision.''
SIBA competitions secretary Mr Dennis Petrie said: ``Following a violation of
the code of conduct during the National Fours Playdowns, Mr John McLardy of the
Galleon Club was disqualified from the competition. The club have been
permitted to field a substitute in place of Mr McLardy.
``We will be asking the Galleon Club at a later date what action they have
taken against the individual concerned and, if satisfied, I would anticipate
that would be an end to the matter,'' Mr Petrie said.
Mr McLardy was replaced by clubmate Mr Willie Mackie for yesterday's match
which they lost 22-7 to Auchinleck.

Pro-lifers in America will score a major success if Congress votes to ban an
abortion procedure, reports Ros Davidson
AS debate over America's abortion policy escalates once again, an infant whose
mother was at the centre of one of the most disturbing incidents in the battle
will soon be one year old.
On Capitol Hill the US Senate is about to consider an unprecedented ban on a
rare type of abortion sometimes performed late in pregnancy. Debate about
whether to make the so-called ``dilation and extraction'' method a federal
crime is expected today, with a final vote - which lobbyists predict could be
extremely close - as soon as Wednesday.
Meanwhile in Nebraska a child born as Americans readied to celebrate Christmas
last year will have his or her first birthday on Friday. The mother of the
baby, whose name and gender are not being publicised, was an unwed teenager
whom town officials held in custody until she agreed to have the child and not
an abortion. They objected that she had an appointment later that week at a
local clinic. The procedure would have been legal and with her parents' consent.
In a tale that seems out of the Dark Ages, 15-year-old Ruby Scott was held
against her will by a posse of local sheriff's deputies, her high-school
boyfriend and his family and other officials acting as vigilantes in the
isolated Nebraska town of Blair. The girl had just discovered she was 23 weeks
pregnant, apparently as she had always had irregular periods.
The scene that unfolded on a quiet street in the small, conservative community
as the pregnant youngster was taken from her family was hardly biblical. The
Scotts, already in hiding at a cousin's house after being assaulted on their
own doorstep, awoke to find themselves surrounded by more than 10 police cars
containing armed lawmen. That is according to a civil lawsuit filed on behalf
of the family.
The pregnant teenager, her father Bud, who is a truck driver, and her mother
Connie, had long-term ties to the area and had been law-abiding people, says
their lawyer Janelle Kleveland. But they did have an appointment at the local
clinic, where Ruby would have had a day and a half of counselling before
agreeing to a termination.
The girl was arrested and held overnight at the local jail house, while that
night town buildings were plastered with posters calling the Scotts ``baby
murderers''. The next day the girl was placed in what was called foster care
and interrogated alone, although she was a minor, by the county attorney. And
within a day a judge ordered the girl released on condition there would be no
abortion - unless ordered by the court.
Two local doctors, apparently ``pro-life'' in their sympathies, even stated in
writing that the procedure might harm the young woman, although they had not
examined her and were not basing their opinions on her history, says attorney
Kleveland, whose complaint is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union in
New York.
Not surprisingly, Ruby and her parents, who had no legal representation, agreed
she would not have an abortion. Yet when the youngster tried returning to high
school afterwards she was so harassed and threatened she had to be tutored at
home. And four months ago the family moved to another town within Nebraska.
Emotions in Blair still run high. The day the lawsuit was filed the Scotts' old
home was vandalised. Even so, the case is unprecedented even in the small
conservative community, on the Missouri River in the American heartland. ``No
other case quite like it has ever gone to court in the US,'' says Kleveland.
``(Ruby) does not want this kind of thing ever to happen to anyone again,'' she
said.
The fight against legal abortion - or ``pro-life movement'' - has already made
inroads in Washington. Last month the House of Representatives banned the
procedure about to be debated again in the US Senate. Supporters and opponents
alike described it as a first move in rolling back abortion rights, protected
since a landmark US Supreme Court decision.
``I think this is a step forward in the battle to protect the unborn in this
country,'' said the Bill's sponsor, Congressman Charles Canady, after an hour
of emotional debate. The procedure at issue in the Bill, ``D&amp;E'', is performed
on perhaps 450 women yearly, often because the foetus is tragically deformed or
the mother's life at risk.
But during the debate the technique was dubbed ``partial birth'' and an ``ugly
reality'' of the abortion business. Drawings unveiled on the house floor, said
to depict the procedure, were gruesome - and apparently inaccurate. And one
congressman long known for opposing abortion, Henry Hyde, commented: ``It is
too cruel, (more suited) to Dr Joseph Mengele or Dr Kervorkian.''
The vote also marked a change in strategy. Republican Christopher Smith, a
leading supporter of the Bill, said anti-abortion law-makers would ``begin to
focus on the (abortion) methods and declare them to be illegal''.
America's abortion rate is higher than in any other developed country. And
although numerous opinion polls suggest most do want abortion available under
certain conditions, opposition is extremely vocal - and sometimes violent. Of
the 1.5 million abortions performed yearly in the US, an estimated 13,000 are
after 4!s months and 600 in the third trimester or after 26 weeks.
If the US Senate follows suit and outlaws the procedure, it would be the first
time the US Congress has voted to ban a specific medical procedure. Under the
Bill, doctors could be jailed for two years and fined up to $250,000. It would
also be a startling measure of the success of the agenda promoted on Capitol
Hill by fundamentalist Christians and conservatives so prominently over the
past year.
Although President Bill Clinton says he will veto the Bill on constitutional
grounds, lobbyists for reproductive rights fear that it is merely a first step
in dismantling access to abortion.
In other legislation currently pending in congress, government payment for
abortions would be denied for poor women except in cases of rape, incest, or
risk to the mother's life. Federal employees would not have abortion covered by
health benefits. And abortions would be explicitly banned at US military bases
overseas.

WHATEVER developments and transformations of style his music had been through
over the past 35 years, the great Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki has not
lost his teeth. In his early days, his was the most searing, abrasive music
that could be heard. Subsequently, over several decades, his music began to
take a romantic, expressive turn.
On Saturday, following the conferment of an honorary degree of doctor of music
on the legendary Pole by the University of Glasgow, the Chamber Group of
Scotland gave the UK premieres of two of his recent chamber works, pieces which
revealed the composer's absolute mastery of style and technique.
The String Trio, from 1991, opened like the Penderecki of old, with a machine
gun-like series of explosive chords, fired off with tight, abrasive attack.
These acted as a sort of framing device for a set of highly expressive solos,
beautifully played by violist Carolyn Sparey-Gillies, cellist Robert Irvine,
and violinist Ruth Crouch. With scurries into the shadows, and very fast,
bristling music leading into a more traditional, driving finale, this was
classic, breathtaking Penderecki. Clarinettist Lawrence Gill joined the trio in
a mesmeric performance of the 1993 Clarinet Quartet, a stunningly beautiful and
rather elliptical work whose evocative and melancholy lyricism, especially in
its haunting finale, where the music ended in a halo of suspended sound, was
suggestive of Shostakovich.

WOW, what a knock-out show. The explosion of rapturous applause that greeted
the finale to this tour of hits from musicals must have been heard halfway down
Buchanan Street.
A West End Gala evening was the bill, presenting a quartet of singers who have
all starred in a clutch of recent major stage productions ranging through Miss
Saigon and Phantom of the Opera to Les Miserables. And in support none other
than our very own Royal SNO under the baton of a singularly urbane Martin Yates.
This was a performance that genuinely lived up to its title. It had everything
- snappy introductions from Martin Yates, soft-coloured lighting with a wisp of
smokiness, slick entrances, three changes of outfit for the ladies, silky
playing from the orchestra and, best of all, it had four voices that really
knew how to sell a song.
Ethan Freeman got the biggest reception in the first half for his dramatically
powerful duet Phantom of the Opera with Katrina Murphy. And with the aid of
mega-amplification mikes, the spectre of the notorious concert hall acoustic
was well and truly blasted away.
The two ladies sounded as good as they looked, Katrina Murphy having the purer
sound but Kim Criswell taking the edge in expressiveness.
Graham Bickley was up against strong competition here, but still managed some
powerful crescendos.
Power was the catchword and, in a stunning One Day More, orchestra and singers
combined to go out in a roof-raiser that could be followed only by encoring it
all over again.

THE Conservative councillor was being interviewed on the airwaves the morning
after the launch of the Constitutional Convention's parliamentary blueprint.
Riveting stuff it was too. For was she not able to tell the nation to the penny
what a Scottish parliament would cost the average shop assistant in tax
increases? This is truly impressive. Before the next election has even taken
place, before there is any change of government, before the drafting or passage
of a Scotland Bill, before the election of a single member of Scotland's new
legislature, before the make-up of its ruling administration is known, before
any debate has even begun on its budgetary options, Councillor Daphne Sleigh
just knows that the parliament will instantly employ its reserve powers to vary
income tax.
Moreover, since we must presume she knows these reserve powers cannot be
employed without consulting the electorate, she has been able to conclude this
will happen and the people will say yes please.
Councillor Sleigh, such are her quite remarkable powers of prediction, even
knows the result of the subsequent vote on the proposal, how much the tax will
rise by, and has intimate knowledge of the normal contents of Senga
McCafferty's take-home pay from Boots.
Truly this is a woman whose talents have been squaundered on the modest stage
of local government in Edinburgh. Surely a woman of such remarkable certainties
should be sitting on Chancellor Clarke's right hand announcing with equal
facility the likely percentage growth of the UK economy, the level of the
public-sector borrowing requirement until the millennium, and the projected
inflation rate for the tax year 1996/97. And this is not the kind of input Mr
Clarke could readily scorn, given that he got that particular set of statistics
entirely wrong in his previous Budget.
Of course there could be another explanation for Daphne's fiscal fluency. It
may be that she is not quite the mathematical mystic Meg her broadcast
suggests. It may be that her startling prescience has more mundane origins. It
may be that Mr Forsyth and his growing army of streetwise aparatchiks (morning,
Brian, Hi, Gerald) has concluded that the only tactics left are the scare
variety. So they have quickly concocted on the back of some handy envelopes the
kind of sums they hope will frighten the pants off the average Scottish
taxpayer. The strategy, after all, has a very reasonable track record. Back in
1979 the same horror stories were relentlessly circulated. And the fact that
the modest Assembly then proposed had no revenue-raising powers didn't prevent
Mr Forsyth's predecessors from predicting it would all end in financial tears.
The sheer beauty of having every Tory spokesperson sing off the same hymn sheet
about tartan taxes and the like is that since the figures are entirely made up
and wholly spurious nobody can actually contradict them. Shrewd eh? And of
course there is the general rule of thumb that if you repeat something often
and loudly enough some people will think you're telling the truth.
But what is so depressing about this orchestrated vilification of a Scottish
parliament is that the debate is being conducted solely on cost. What does it
say about your view of the Scottish people if all you think they give a damn
about is the thickness of your wallet?
The Rev.Bob Waters of the Congregational Church of Scotland has taken a lot of
stick over the past few days because his speech likened Scotland's union with
England to being married to a money-grubbing, unprincipled prostitute.
I doubt he really intended gratuitously to insult individual friends and
neighbours. I suspect his comments were intended for a culture of government
which made the acquisition of personal wealth the only goal which matters. An
ethos which didn't just suggest there was no such thing as society but
undermined the efforts of voluntary and civic bodies which believe that
individually and collectively we have a responsibility to each other.
Many millions of people all over the UK share the view that the agenda has to
change in pursuit of shared public goals. Indeed many Tories of what used to be
called the one-nation tendency are profoundly unhappy at the party of their
choice being hijacked by the wild-eyed right. So as another preacher man said
last week, loving our own nation doesn't mean lacking respect for others.
But loving our own nation is what this debate should be about. Hell mend all
these prophets of doom, let's clear space for the prophets of democracy. Let's
listen to the unsung heroes and heroines who devoted years to keeping the flame
of Scotland's parliamentary ambitions alive.
People not exercised by tax rates but genuinely enthralled by the opportunity
to shape a new style of politics which might not be adversarial for the sake of
it.
Thrilled at the possibilities of a new voting system actually giving the
electors what they asked for in terms of party representation. Mesmerised by
the thought of starting a new chapter with a level of gender equality about
which Westminister women can only dream.
Of course we don't all share the same ambitions. Some of us are natural
federalists, some determined on independence, some content with partial
devolution. But surely we can agree that a Scottish parliament will better
reflect democracy. Surely we can share genuine excitement at creating something
to reinforce our culture and heritage. Put away your purse Daphne. Loosen your
stays. Listen to your instincts.
Risk a moment of passion about your country. They can't touch you for it.

SO now we know. Mr Major has a maximum of 18 months left to him to turn round
the woeful situation of the Tories. He has this time - signposted by the
``neutral'' Budget - only if he gets lucky and there are no more by-elections
or defections.
At any time now he could find himself in minority Government and subject to a
lethal confidence motion providing Mr Blair with an earlier springboard to
No.10. Mr Major has gone for the long gamble that he can pay off enough debt
and cut state spending sufficiently to deliver a 20p standard tax rate next
autumn.
As the latest, post-Budget, opinion poll (NOP/Sunday Times) indicates that even
more people (71%) distrust him on tax, Tory MPs were becoming even more
fatalistic about their chances. Naturally, most of them, like Mr Heseltine,
state in public that another election win is possible. In private the mood is
very different.
There are three varieties of Tory opinion which, if anything, have hardened
since the Chancellor eschewed a ``go-for-broke'' Budget presaging an election
next year. There are those who believe that after 16 years in power they are
doomed to a real licking, giving Mr Blair a majority in the hundreds. Others
believe that in defeat, Mr Blair's first Government majority will be contained
to 40-80.
The third segment expect defeat, but find reason to hope that the next Labour
Government will have a majority of about only 25. Only 25? - five times greater
than Major's majority now. This is plenty for a normal five-year Parliament;
the element of Tory hope here is that 25 would not be enough for two
Parliaments, or three.
For balance, let me add a fourth strand of opinion which also crops up in
conversation with both Tory and Labour MPs. This provides a scenario in which
Mr Major is able, over the next 18 months (May 22, 1997, is the last deadline
for a General Election), to restore the desperately illusive ``feel-good''
factor. Then the electorate, unable to define the difference between two
conservative parties, will endorse the devil it knows.
This possibility is emphasised by a few Labour MPs who are disconsolate at
their party's lurch to the capitalist right, its low taxation, and
affordable-only state spending policy. They wonder if the voters will think it
worth handing the palm to Labour. It will be interesting to see how many Labour
back benchers defy Mr Blair's abstention order on Tuesday night and vote
against Mr Clarke's 1p cut in the standard rate.
For such Labour fears to come true - Mr Major is preferred as the devil the
voters know - the Prime Minister surely needs an uncharacteristic run of good
luck, not to mention solidarity in his own ranks. It has not escaped the notice
of some, by the way, that since Major is going for another session of
Parliament after this one he might have to face another leadership challenge
next November.
The Prime Minister is gambling heavily on the prospect of sufficient economic
growth between now and then to deliver the #9 a week improvement for the
average family which this Budget puts on offer. He is also depending on the
Private Finance Initiative (PFI) to produce that 20p in the pound standard rate.
His Chancellor writes in today's House Magazine: ``The PFI will lead to better
public services at lower cost. Our objective is to contract out services that
can be provided more efficiently in the private sector, cutting management
overheads and bureaucracy. This does not mean less capital spending, but it
does mean that we will concentrate on priorities.'' The hope is that as the PFI
takes off, he will be able to redirect billions of pounds a year.
Add to this a prospect of cutting interest rates, particularly if the economy
slows down, and a consequential easing in the Treasury's ability to reduce the
#10billion-awry borrowing requirement. This comes from the
``always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life'' wing of the Tory Party.
You could say that Mr Michael Forsyth, the new ``listening Scottish
Secretary'', has at least shown willing to address the call for devolution;
that he has given the Tories a position on the subject that is not entirely
negative. Maybe, just maybe, it will be sufficient to prevent a Tory wipe-out
in Scotland. And if it can be prevented in Scotland, perhaps it can be
prevented south of the Border too.
Optimists have been encouraged by President Clinton's visit to think that a
permanent peace through constitutional agreement in Northern Ireland is more
possible. Should this fall within the 18 months, no doubt Mr Major would gain
much credit. Should peace survive in Bosnia, and with it the Nato
implementation force, the Prime Minister would gain applause. Mr Blair has been
careful to be bi-partisan on both these issues, so the Government's credit for
statesmanship would not be entirely unmitigated in crude political terms. Such
items can nevertheless improve Mr Major's reputation for competence.
More importantly it may be seen that in last week's Budget in which the Tory
right's desire for trenchant tax cuts was thwarted, that Mr Clarke will restore
the balance of the public's belief in the Tories on taxation. He has not sought
to buy votes back in an outrageous fashion.
Labour warns that it will latch on to the slogan ``7p up, 1p down'' from now to
polling day. But Labour will not, it seems, maintain its accusation that Major
has ``lurched to the right''. Mr Blair has fallen silent on this one since the
Budget statement. It was always a cheeky claim, bearing in mind how much he has
shifted his party to the right.
To this extent Mr Blair has been trapped by his own rhetoric. He cannot oppose
Major's 1p cut without weakening his hold on the middle classes. I suspect
``lurch to the right'' is now a dead phrase whether the election is 18 months
or 18 weeks away. Watch them scrap for the middle ground.

THERE will never be a last word on Sherlock Holmes but the first words on the
subject famously appeared in A Study in Scarlet. Looking for lodgings Dr John
Watson, narrator of the novel, meets Stamford who offers to introduce him to a
fellow who might share the rent in some nice rooms: ``You don't know Sherlock
Holmes yet; perhaps you might not care for him as a constant companion.'' As
the world knows, Watson delighted in Holmes as a constant companion. As does
the world delight.
The Glasgow Herald got it right when reviewing A Study in Scarlet in 1887: ``He
is a wonderful man is Mr Sherlock Holmes, but one gets so wonderfully
interested in his cleverness and in the mysterious murder which he unravels
that one cannot lay down the narrative until the end is reached.''
Michael Coren gets it wrong when he writes: ``As for those people who believe
that somehow Holmes was a real person and Conan Doyle a mere conduit, they are
to be pitied.''
Sherlock Holmes is thrillingly real to those who respond to the truth of
fiction; Conan Doyle remains a remote figure in fact. Sherlock Holmes is a real
person by another name and made the name of Conan Doyle matter.
Conan Doyle was the first author whose name meant anything to me. I grew up in
Gayfield Square in Edinburgh and my home from home was the Salon cinema where I
often watched Basil Rathbone playing the part of Sherlock Holmes in moving
films that amazed and enthralled me. One day I wandered from my home to a house
around the corner: number 11 Picardy Place.
This, a plaque explained to my childish amazement, was the birthplace of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes. It seemed astonishing that the
Great Detective on the silver screen could be connected with the name of a man
born round the corner from my little corner of the world. Holmes was more than
a name in my native town.
The birthplace was demolished in 1969; the name of Conan Doyle is now the name
of a pub standing near the site. Conan Doyle would not have been amused by the
development. His father, after all, was a man who turned the corner from
unsuccessful careerism to self-destructive drinking to escape from the grim
reality of his life as a clerk and architect in the Office of Works in
Edinburgh.
Charles Doyle disliked Edinburgh, and so did his first son Arthur as a boy
about town. ``Of my boyhood I need say little,'' wrote the mature Conan Doyle,
``save that it was Spartan at home and more Spartan at the Edinburgh school
where a tawse-brandishing schoolmaster of the old type made our young lives
miserable.'' Same old story of Scottish schooldays as the unhappiest days.
Coren touches on the familiar story of Conan Doyle as a medical student at
Edinburgh University but, perhaps thinking it too familiar, provides few
details. He accepts Joseph Bell as partly the original of Holmes and admits
Conan Doyle himself played a part in the personality of the Great Detective.
Then he fumes: ``Those critics who are convinced that Holmes was simply a
caricature of Bell or just the alter ego of his creator have done enormous
damage to Conan Doyle's reputation as a writer.'' Nobody said it was simply
such or just so.
When Conan Doyle settled down, in March 1886, to write A Study in Scarlet he
thought of the deductive skills of Bell, consulting surgeon at Edinburgh
Infirmary, professor at Edinburgh University, editor of the Edinburgh Medical
Journal - thought of ``my old school teacher Joe Bell, of his eagle face, of
his curious ways, of his eerie trick of spotting details''. Writing to Bell in
1892, Conan Doyle declared: ``It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock
Holmes.'' Bell, while flattered by the compliment from Conan Doyle, replied:
``You are yourself Sherlock Holmes, and well you know it.'' Literature is
larger than life and Holmes is Conan Doyle writ large with a little help from
his old friend Bell.
Conan Doyle attempted to emulate Holmes in two classic cases of actual
deduction. He exposed the injustice done to George Edalji, wrongly accused of
the crime of mutilating cattle in 1903. He championed the cause of Oscar
Slater, wrongly accused of murdering an old woman in Glasgow in 1908. Conan
Doyle could not have acted so impressively had he not been mindful of Bell and
had the heart of Holmes. Considering Conan Doyle as a man capable of mind over
mentor does no damage to his reputation as a writer.
What did damage Conan Doyle's reputation was his book The Coming of the Fairies
(1922). He had complete faith in photographs of fairies faked by two Bradford
girls in 1917. Conan Doyle was absolutely convinced by the obviously cut-out
characters strutting their supernatural stuff around the girls.
How could the creator of Sherlock Holmes be so credulous? Coren contends Conan
Doyle was unfortunately affected by ``a heavy dose of wishful thinking, spiced
with the trusting assumption that the two girls were above board''. There is an
easier explanation. Conan Doyle could be as daft as any man seeking escape from
an appalling experience, in his case the death of his son Kingsley in 1917.
Conan Doyle was an imaginative escapologist. Hence his fascination with Harry
Houdini, the greatest escapologist of all.
Although Houdini was sceptical of spiritualists Conan Doyle had his wife Jean
insist, as a medium in a seance, she had an automatically written message from
the dead mother of the great magician. Conan Doyle was certain of his wife's
spiritual strength but Houdini found the message weak. First, it was signed
with a cross, and Houdini reckoned this an unlikely communication from a
religious Jew. Second, the message was written in English which disturbed
Houdini: ``Message written by Lady Doyle claiming the spirit of my dear mother
had control of her hand - my sainted mother could not write English and spoke
broken English.''
Houdini denounced Jean in an article and Conan Doyle wrote to Houdini: ``I felt
rather sore about it...... I know by many examples the purity of my wife's
mediumship.'' The creator of the Great Detective could not convince the Great
Houdini.
Coren is convinced by Conan Doyle's enthusiasm for the afterlife: ``A man who
was sufficiently gifted and brilliant to invent and develop Sherlock
Holmes...... surely did not have one gargantuan weak spot when it came to his
personal belief in life after death and the supernatural...... A contemporary
student of Arthur Conan Doyle should in a broad sense be a spiritualist.'' So,
of course, when Conan Doyle died he ``entered through the very large door into
a world that we can only imagine''. Beyond belief.
Coren believes in Conan Doyle as more of a man than mad ``Sherlockian
monomaniacs'' can imagine. Yet who would read this extremely lively study of
Conan Doyle had he not escaped from domestic dullness and recreated himself in
the apparently immortal image of Holmes?
I rest my case for Holmes as the quintessential Conan Doyle on that question.

THE City of Glasgow Chorus pride themselves in investigating the less familiar
corners of the repertoire. Neither of the two works they performed with the
Orchestra of Scottish Opera under their conductor and musical director, Graham
Taylor, could be described as concert hall staples, at least in this part of
the world.
Poulenc's Gloria captures the more expansive side of his religious music at the
expense of the quiet mystery of his more introspective religious meditations.
The chorus sounded well-focused and nicely balanced, but have a tendency to
sweeten the music which served to underplay the spikier, Stravinskian echoes of
the work, and made the Laudamus more reminiscent of a Hollywood spectacular
than devotional hymn of praise. Elsewhere, though, they achieved a pleasingly
serene elegance, notably in the final movement.
It seems reasonable enough that an opera orchestra should feel at home playing
Puccini, and, apart from some radiant woodwind playing in the Poulenc, they
sounded happier in the Italian's large-scale Messa di Gloria. It was Puccini's
first major work, and remains a substantial achievement for a 20-year-old
student, although it is not without its longueurs.
The chorus revelled in its even more substantial, emotionally overt canvas,
while all three soloists - soprano Linda Gerrard, tenor Peter Wilson, and bass
Graeme Danby - contributed solid performances. As in the Poulenc, however, the
overall effect seemed a little routine, and the performances ultimately emerged
as agreeable rather than absorbing.

Ruth Wishart examines how the arts can change lives - transforming the
expectations of many whose potential was restricted by artificial social
boundaries
WHY are we here? We write to stop ourselves going nuts.
THUS says the preface of a poetry and prose anthology produced by a
single-parents writers' group in Strathclyde. They've learned at first hand one
of the wondrous bonuses of this trade...... that writing is not merely a means
of self-expression but an escape from uncomfortable realities.
And in exploring that creative potential as a group come other benefits born of
shared experience; the growing sense of confidence and self-belief, the comfort
of learning that while every human being is unique almost no human condition,
however difficult, is. Knowing that other people are trying to navigate life in
the same leaky craft doesn't give you safe passage through the hazards but it
does help place them in manageable perspectives.
Today the Scottish Arts Council publish Changing Lives, the latest of a series
of works highlighting the effects of the arts when they are interwoven with our
social fabric rather than seen as an optional add on.
This particular publication explores the effects of arts-based projects on 10
groups, all of whom have differing needs, but all of whom bear witness to the
message that dance, or drama, or music, or writing or any combination of those
can transform expectations and enhance - sometimes in the most unpredictable
ways - the quality of lives being lived against the odds.
Yet often one of the difficulties these groups had to confront was that the
limitations placed on their experience were not as a result of disabilities but
as a result of carers who had consistently underestimated potential or placed
artificial boundaries on experiment.
Strathclyde Orchestral Productions, for instance, met initial resistance from
some people running adult training centres who advised artistic director Gordon
Dougall that ``none of our members will be able to play because they are
physically disabled''. A judgment which quite failed to take into account the
potent combination of the human spirit wired up to technological advance.
Dougall has always seen the operation as an ideal way of integrating
able-bodied and disabled players rather than having professional musicians
parachute in for limited interaction.
The result has been a skill level which has seen SOP make recordings and reach
live audiences beyond the constituency of families and friends. In fact, some
disabled musicians who began with SOP have gone on to join professional musical
ensembles.
The importance of this project is not just the uncovering and nurturing of real
potential, but insisting that disabled artists are not judged by separate
standards. All artists want to be thought of as good, not ``good under the
circumstances''.
Many of the other projects were more temporary but apparently no less
fulfilling. The Patchwork of Memories, as they called an oral history project
on Islay and Jura, used the knowledge and experience of senior citizens to
ensure that traditional skills and local culture would be passed on.
A pilot study at Annan in Dumfriesshire gave the long-stay elderly professional
help and materials to explore latent talent in the visual arts.
And once you've witnessed the fruits of these ventures at first hand it's very
difficult not to get religion about the potency of the arts for ordinary
people, however extraordinary their current circumstances. It's no accident
that many of these projects found funding through education and social work
departments because the evidence of their success in dealing with everything
from mental illness to delinquency is now overwhelming.
The resident drama therapist at Dundee Rep's community department now provides
a region-wide service for people dealing with all kinds of mental problems
including dementia.
Dundee has also used dance therapeutically as has the Projekt 11.92 Dance
Company who work with young people who have learning difficulties and were
directly employed by Strathclyde region's social work department - ``determined
to take dance into areas where people don't usually ask for it''.
In the light of which it's no accident either that this particular report will
turn up in the in-tray of executives of the new local authorities whose job it
will be to decide where their budgets, often much more modest than the regional
variety, will be targeted.
SAC director Seona Reid hopes that the cities at least will follow Glasgow's
example and set up a fund to help keep such innovative schemes afloat until the
new bodies have had time to take spending decisions.
Not least because some of the groups have a track record it would be folly to
lose. The Lung Ha Theatre Company started in 1984 in Edinburgh to give new
opportunities on the stage to people with learning difficulties. It's now the
largest company of its kind in Scotland, has 10 productions under its belt, and
meets weekly to give members classes in all kinds of stagecraft.
It has matured into a company which has been welcomed in mainstream venues and
whose work has been televised. It has changed lives. Given a fair financial
wind it will change more.

THE Charter Mark award scheme is the equivalent of an Oscar for public
organisations in Britain and today, the winners have been announced, 20 of
which are Scottish.
What, you may ask, is Charter Mark?
It's an award scheme for organisations in the public service such as hospitals
and other NHS services; schools; colleges and universities; Police, fire and
ambulance services; council services; Government services; benefit or
employment offices; water, gas and electricity companies.
The award is given for excellence, and is not easy to obtain; the standards of
those applying is high. Only the best succeed, and a winning organisation has
to show the judges that it provides an excellent service.
It has to demonstrate that it meets those criteria:
l Setting clear and tough performance standards; tells users what those are and
whether they are achieved.
l Tells users in a clear, straightforward way, about all the services and help
available and how to get the most out of them.
l Consults users on what services they need and how these can be made better,
and makes good use of customers' ideas.
l Gives users a choice wherever possible.
l Has courteous, helpful staff and a user-friendly approach to such things as
opening hours and customers' particular needs.
l Makes it easy for users when they are displeased, and acts swiftly to correct
what is wrong.
l Careful budgeting and efficient, effective use of their money.
l Has made real improvements in service quality, and has new ideas, and
improvements ready for the future.
Each Charter Mark award is given for three years, although if standards are not
maintained, it can be taken away. After the three years is up, holders have to
re-apply.
Applications are judged by the Prime Minister's Advisory Panel on the Citizens'
Charter, headed by Sir James Blyth, deputy chairman and chief executive of the
Boots Company plc, and the Citizens' Charter Minister before being finally
approved by the Prime Minister.
Independent consultants supervise the assessment process. Organisations submit
a 10-page application with supporting material, and a team of Charter Mark
assessors who are experienced in diverse areas of public service, considers
this.
At the same time judges get information about applicants' performance from
Government departments, independent regulators, the Audit Commission and other
sources. Whenever possible they are keen to seek evidence from customer panels
or committees.
The best of the applications are short listed, and visited either by members of
the Prime Minister's Advisory Panel, Charter Mark assessors or senior Cabinet
Office staff. Once all the evidence has been thoroughly examined a list of
winners is recommended by the Prime Minister's Advisory Panel.
Winners receive a crystal trophy, a certificate signed by the Prime Minister
and the right to use the Charter Mark logo on stationery and other written
material, on their vehicles, and other equipment for three years. More
important, they get recognition of their first-class service.
The scale of awards has been growing steadily since the scheme was introduced
in 1992. That year up to 50 awards were available with 36 winners of which 35
have re-applied this year. Twenty-five have been successful, while the rest
were not. In the case of the latter, the judges recognised their commitment to
quality and expressed the hope that with the assistance of feedback and advice
from Charter Mark assessors they may be successful next year.
In 1993, 93 winners were announced, while the following year saw 98 receiving
awards, this year a record 223 have won the Charter Mark, with another 193
Highly Commended.
In recognition of the high quality of this year's 740 applications the number
of awards available was increased by the judges. For the first time this year,
the public was able to nominate organisations they considered deserved to win
the award - the route by which some 80 winning organisations scooped their
awards.
The chairman of the judges, Lord Blyth of Rowington, said: ``Charter Marks are
the Oscars of public service. We are very impressed by the quality of this
years' applications. They demonstrate the real commitment to quality of so many
of the people working in public service. I am delighted that there are now a
total of 414 organisations, across the country holding Charter Marks.''
Each Charter Mark award is given for three years, although if standards are not
maintained, it can be taken away

CENTRAL Scotland Police are one of the recipients of this year's Charter Awards.
Following the appointment of chief constable William Wilson in 1990, the
success of his very community-oriented approach to policing has become known
and admired nationally.
Fundamental to the force's ``We can plan out crime'' philosophy is partnership,
and 170 have been formed within the community, with local and regional
councils, schools, businesses and so on.
Invoked in 1991, the strategy seems to be paying off handsomely.
The area's crime figures for 1991 were 25,028, with a crime detection rate of
44.7%; by 1994 the crime figures had fallen to 20,133, and the detection rate
had risen to 56.98%, while the latter figure to date this year has been
successfully eased up once more to about 60%.
The initiative also involves strategies to reduce road traffic accidents.
Throughout their ``patch'' senior officers in each area can make autonomous
decisions on the best policing for their particular locality, based on its
needs and problems.

``THIS has been a panto of two halves,'' declared Ofpants - the official panto
watchdog - ``and don't bother with any wisecracks about intervals.'' A
surreptitious glance at Ofpants's checklist revealed various ticks and crosses.
A kind of squiggly star beside The Krankies - he's the dame, she's
Jimmee-Washee, sorry Wishee-Washee - and various approving scribbles, including
``energetically vulgar''. Further down, a curious doodle . . . a skull and
cross bones maybe? . . . against Linda Nolan's Aladdin and the word ``Yikes!''
underlined three times.
The old watchdog's right, I'm afraid. The Pavilion panto cobbles together
genuine high spots with stuff that arrives centre-stage on automatic pilot and
is likely to stay in complacent low gear throughout the run. Why? Because
good-hearted audiences will simply shrug aside echoes of routine songs ground
out in phoney ``isn't this a good time?'' fashion.
And they'll overlook dialogue that reduces the plot to cues for the songs. And
they'll not even mind the non-performances of Linda Nolan, Mike Hayward, Nicola
Auld - who all seem to feel the costume will say it all for them - and instead
audiences will tell their friends about how absolutely mega Eunice Huthart (of
TV Gladiators fame) was as the kick-boxing genie. She is, because she has an
all-out, enthusiastic personality.
And kids, the lads especially, will gleefully mimic Janette Krankie's wobbly
knees and throaty cry of ``Ah'm a durty wee boay!'' When The Krankies are going
through their astute paces - acting silly, acting saucy, but most of all acting
up for the audience - Aladdin fan-dabi-does work. Otherwise, it
fan-dubious-disnae.

<HEADLINE>Johnnie Cochran fought racism in the OJ trial and the same fight brings him to the UK Winning hand from a raw deal Anne Simpson</HEADLINE>

TO the sound of hosannas and much else besides, Johnnie Cochran moves elegantly
through life, a small, compact figure in topdog clothes, saviour of the rich in
deep trouble, pop icon to the poor.
That strange combination is also what sets many teeth on edge. Ordinarily the
first quality should cancel out the second but there has never been anything
ordinary about Cochran. He is one of those exceptionally perceptive and
swift-talking individuals who, one feels, could have been a conjurer had
showbusiness beckoned. But Cochran was drawn to another form of stagecraft, the
American legal system, and at the bar he has specialised in out-foxing the
establishment at every turn.
Last October 3, at 10.05am, Los Angeles time, the repeated words Not Guilty,
voiced in Courtroom 103, ensured Cochran's most spectacular and profitable
triumph so far.
But if the OJ Simpson circus is over, the various sideshows are not. The other
day, Cochran, the leading defence lawyer in the sportsman's trial, arrived in
Britain to share his knowledge on how best to handle that most primitive of
hatreds, racism. When we met he had been in Brixton earlier in the day. By the
end of the week he would have visited Liverpool's Toxteth. Somewhere in between
the MP, Bernie Grant, had arranged a House of Commons reception for him. There
had been numerous packed and lively meetings where standing ovations were
routine. And then, just before another get-together with Britain's black
community, a strange thing happened.
Someone had wrongly informed Scotland Yard that Johnnie R Cochran jr was armed.
He was questioned and his hotel room searched, a clear case of discrimination
against ethnic peoples, raged his hosts, the Society of Black Lawyers.
For his part, Cochran took the incident philosophically. If nothing else it
proved his point that none of us is free of prejudice. But that rapturous
response he had received from so many Caribbean and Asian audiences also told
us something about contemporary Britain: we have a race crisis here which most
of us are failing to address.
``In the United States one-third of African-American males have been involved
with the legal system, and I'm learning that the situation is not much better
in this country. We're going in the wrong direction if a society believes it is
productive to lock up its minority groups,'' he says.
On that winter's night at the Friends' Meeting House in Euston Road, the sense
of grievance about law and order enforcers in London, Birmingham, Manchester,
Liverpool, Bristol and Leeds, was beyond the comprehension of most whites, and
that, of course, is a large part of the problem. But on this particular
occasion the audience was not just drawn from the usual battlements of urban
deprivation. It also came from residential neighbourhoods up and down the
country.
And when Cochran concluded his address by pledging to return to the States and
raise money for the parents of the slain black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, so
that they can pursue England's first private prosecution for murder, the
applause was thunderous. Afterwards, Cochran spoke about meeting Stephen's
parents and being overwhelmed by their dignity.
``I was enormously impressed by them, and this kind of international solidarity
will let the powers that be know that if victims cannot gain justice in the
normal way, then from across the Atlantic and perhaps with the help of the
continent we will pool resources to finance civil cases. If the Lawrence action
is successful, then the Government will pay attention.''
There is, of course, a sharp irony to such vigorous championing from Johnnie
Cochran on this issue, for civil suits, now filed by the families of Ronald
Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson might yet prevent his client OJ from having
much of a life. But Cochran doesn't appear to be overly concerned by this
disobliging connection. After all, he prefers to see that whole amazing episode
in his career like this: ``We got that guy off because we did our job. The fact
is the police investigation made so many telling errors we were able to reduce
the prosecution's mountain of evidence to a molehill. I prefer to think we won
because of `reasonable doubt' rather than because some smart lawyer who knew
the tricks beguiled the jury.''
Cochran is 57 but one of those who could easily pass for 40. He admits
delightedly to being a dandy, relishing hand-crafted suits and shoes, and
neckties of high swank. Born and raised in middle-class Los Angeles, he was
already profoundly wealthy before the OJ trial. Early in his career he became
the scourge of the persistently racist LA Police Department, a commitment
which, in fact, made him a hero in the black slums long before they had ever
thought of elevating OJ Simpson to the pantheon of  idols.
But somewhere along life's journey Cochran swung his attention away from
low-dollar cases and towards those which now earn him at least $1m a year,
allowing him all the necessary rich man's trappings - a Rolls-Royce, one
mansion in the Hollywood hills, another by the Pacific Ocean, and the
distinction of having won at least $45m in damages over a period of 20-odd
years. This is the lawyer who brokered the settlement over allegations that the
singer Michael Jackson had sexually abused a teenage boy. And this is the
lawyer who openly says: `I started fighting police assault because it was
wrong. Then thanks to the American Way I made a lot of money while doing it. I
found I could do well and do some good at the same time. But in the States that
isn't always popular.'
BUT had OJ Simpson been poor would Cochran have defended him? At first he
doesn't directly answer but roams around a philosophical tract: ``It's
incumbent on all of us to speak out when people's lives are at stake, whether
these people have financial resources or not.'' And then, as if pressing a
passion button, Cochran's speech becomes even faster and emotional: ``We need
lawyers who care about their clients in the way that lawyers, by tradition,
were meant to do. This isn't about billing out; it's about doing the right
thing.''
To many Americans, however, Johnnie Cochran is the very last person who should
be free and easy with advice. In many minds the OJ Simpson acquittal
demonstrates a trial where money talked, a story where the defence team proved
that if you have enough wealth you can throw it at the American criminal
justice system and tie it up with a thousand strands of procedural tangles. And
for many others it illustrated how a good lawyer can be ``a bad citizen'',
turning a trial into a political caucus where jurors debased their role of
rendering ``a just verdict'' in order to send society a message about corrupt
and racist cops.
But if these are the pervasive views of white Americans, says Cochran, then
that in itself is racism. ``I dare say that if OJ Simpson had been charged with
killing his first wife, Margaret, who is black, there would have been no
interest in this case at all. Do you know that Time magazine took OJ's face and
darkened it for the cover, to make it look sinister? That's part and parcel of
the whole attitude. Having said that, though, the fact that the cameras were in
the courtroom was instructive. If it had been left to print journalists to tell
everyone whether or not those gloves fitted, they would have had every excuse
to claim Simpson was acting when he put them on. But the world could see they
did not fit.''
Now, two months after his freedom from that double murder charge, Cochran's
client is still condemned by someone every day. His lover has dumped him, his
neighbours and friends have retreated, his talent agency of 20 years has struck
him from its books, and the promoters behind all those lucrative deals which
were touted initially have backed off, fearing public revenge should they be
seen to market the OJ initials.
AND among the many bizarre twists in this wretched courtroom tale there is the
one in which Cochran's own defence colleague stripped the shine from their
success immediately after the trial. Still within the shadow of the court,
Robert Shapiro confirmed the general view that Cochran had manipulated the jury
by ``playing the race card from the bottom of the deck''.
The contrast between the two men at that point was almost theatrical: Shapiro's
jowly, Semitic face, a landscape of gloom, and Cochran, the world's most famous
black lawyer, beaming and slapping his client's back in exultation, then moving
out among his people like a god.
The jury's message was, in fact, the old one. America remains one country but
two nations, black and white. ``We have a saying in America,'' says Cochran.
``We arrived in different ships but we're all in the same boat now.'' And he
adds: ``Black and white, we've got to work this thing out together.'' But
though the circus may indeed be over, the verdict sideshows may never end. Yet
was it really the trial of the century? If so, that           puts the
proceedings at Nuremberg in an interesting perspective.
We're going in the wrong direction if society believes it is productive to lock
up its   minority groups

Jennifer Cunningham reports on a unique venture in which Scotland is helping
China rescue its native rhododendrons
THE tall, unassuming young man might pass for a minor academic, but his large
feet walk regularly in the footsteps of some of this century's greatest
explorers and his hands are helping to save the world.
The exploits of Scotland's great plant hunters are legendary. George Forrest
survived a massacre in Tibet and saw his companions brutally killed in his
quest for the 31,000 species he brought back to Britain. They included 309
species of rhododendron and formed the basis of the greatest collection in the
Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.
Ninety years later, the collection's curator, David Paterson, can cheerfully
refer to Forrest and his fellow-collector Ernest ``Chinese'' Wilson as
plunderers because for the first time the garden has returned living plant
material to its country of origin. Even in China's vast wildernesses its native
species are under threat.
``We sent them Datapost,'' he said of the 220 precious and fragile baby
rhododendrons from Edinburgh he has just helped to plant in the new Hua Xi
Botanical Garden in China's Sichuan Province. Latter-day plant-returners also
have their hairy moments. Datapost turned out to be not as specific as they had
hoped. They delivered the plants hundreds of miles away from the required
destination, causing customs to impound them while the paperwork was untangled.
``Remember, these plants had to be washed of all soil because you cannot
transport soil around the world, so they can only survive for a very short
period and then they need intensive after-care once they get there. So they
were sitting in a customs office while we were frantically trying to get the
paperwork sorted out.''
They survived the ordeal of being in transit for almost a fortnight and
although the success rate will not be 100%, Paterson is confident it will be
over 90%. Like all gardeners, Paterson, a horticulturist rather than a
botanist, believes it is prudent to give away plants.
``Edinburgh has the largest collection of species rhododendron anywhere in the
world. While China has more species in nature, ours are fully-documented and
classified. What we want to do is build up a parallel collection in the Hua Xi
gardens because that prevents us having all our eggs in one basket if, for
example, we had disease in our collection. We have about 454 species in the
botanic garden, about half of which are hardy, but we want to increase our
holding and we also want to increase the biodiversity by bringing in new plants
from China,'' he said.
since the Earth Summit in Rio, biodiversity has been the buzz word. The UK
Government's commitment to it was to set up the Darwin Initiative to fund
projects to conserve endangered species. It has put up #53,400 for the
Edinburgh rhodo return. It also funded a year-long study visit to Edinburgh by
a Chinese horticulturalist, Guiyan Geng. She was involved in growing the
rhododendrons which were sent out to China and returned with David Paterson to
oversee the planting.
``The material we took back came from a number of places that no longer hold
rhododendron populations because the land has changed, usually by clear-felling
and increased grazing by yak,'' said Paterson, who added that they also took
species from the eastern Himalayas, North America and Europe because it is so
difficult for Chinese botanists to go there. The Chinese have been well-warned
to keep the European species under check so that they don't run riot and
destroy the habitat.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed the Hua Xi garden on two sites: a
small garden adjacent to Dujiang City and a big garden which ranges over 1000
hectares of a steep-sided horseshoe-shaped valley. The valley bottom will be
the site of the rhododendron garden.
It will soon be under immense people pressure. Keen to develop eco-tourism, the
Chinese Government is building hotels in the valley because it expects the
garden to become a world tourist attraction. Can it maintain a balance between
development and protecting the flora and fauna?
Paterson cites two natural advantages in keeping the tourists in check.
``Because the terrain is very steep, most of the tourists are going to remain
down at the bottom and so the impact of tourism is going to be contained. It is
also the ideal habitat for leeches and the urban and suburban Chinese hate
leeches, so they are not going to climb up the mountainsides either,'' he said.
Among the native rhododendrons is zhaguense, a real rarity which is found only
on the mountain Zheguo Shan. It is a bit of a coup for Paterson: ``As far as I
am aware it is not in cultivation anywhere in the world and I have brought back
some seeds so that it can be cultivated here as well as in China. Another
species found in association with it, but which is not so rare, is agonnipha,
which is in cultivation and we have some in Edinburgh.
``Part of the work which I was doing there was reintroducing species which we
have in Edinburgh to China. They included belagense which is a small
rhododendron less than one metre high which grows on the snow at 4500 metres,
seeds of which were brought back here for the first time by colleagues in 1991
and we now have half a dozen plants growing in the nursery. We did go on an
expedition to look for it, but the conditions were against us. The snow had
come early, it was very misty and we were driving along steep dirt tracks.
Eventually we had to abandon the vehicle and we walked for the best part of a
day searching these mountains, but failed to find it.
The repatriated plants are, of course, likely to do better than their siblings
in Edinburgh, since they are going into perfect growing conditions. Edinburgh
is drier than is ideal for rhodies.
``I don't think we can regard Hua Xi garden as a satellite but we can certainly
curate the collections together to some extent,'' said David Paterson, who
believes that continued collaboration is vital to the rhodies in both gardens.
The obstacle to that is that the Darwin Initiative funding will be exhausted
after a follow-up visit next year.

THEY say that people who live in Edinburgh never get round to visiting the
castle. There's always tomorrow. Much the same applies to people in Brussels
who rarely stop to look at the remarkable architecture of this city - or what's
left of it.
I am as guilty as the next incomer to Brussels. We rarely see more of the city
than the EU institutions. The EU is not Brussels, of course, any more than
Brussels is Belgium. But there are surprises for those who take the trouble to
look.
Last week I visited the elegant Brussels home of Gerry McGeary and his family
who hail from Hamilton. He mentioned with some satisfaction that a previous
tenant had been one Karl Marx. You never know the minute in this town.
Brussels is famous for its town planning. For years there wasn't any. The
result is delightful chaos - jumbles of distinctive and stylish, mostly stone,
buildings all setting themselves off in haphazard rows along narrow streets.
The downside is traffic. This city was never built for the motor car which now
suffocates it. Tree-lined boulevards have become traffic canyons, death traps
for cyclists and some of the worst-polluted streets in Europe.
To make matters worse the EU has commandeered much of central Brussels, razing
scores of wonderful buildings to put up filing cabinets. This week's talking
point is the appearance of the Berlaymont building. Workmen are completing the
strange task of wrapping it in white canvas, like a big parcel, so that work
can begin on stripping it of asbestos. The job and consequent blight will last
for years. It looks weird in its shroud. Most people think it also looks better
that way.
But away from Euro-land there is another world. I went in search of the McGeary
Gallery, which is a business owned by Francesca McGeary, daughter of Gerry, who
teaches art at the European School in Brussels, and his wife. (Francesca bears
an uncanny resemblance to the Duchess of York and is, apparently, often
mistaken for her by a royalty-conscious Belgian public.)
The McGeary family live in flats above the Gallery in Rue Jean D'Ardenne, not
far from the swanky Avenue Louise with its designer shops where the price tags
come with endless zeros.
Rue Jean d'Ardenne is a typical Brussels back street - the sort you rush past
every day without pausing to look. It has its share of old and elegant
buildings, their splendour somewhat faded now, some others which are more in
the utility end of the market and a stately old school which some official
vandal has painted a sickly sea green.
Belgians do that sort of thing. This, remember, is the city which, despite its
celebrated architecture, is happy to be best known for its ridiculous Manneken
Pis. Only Brussels could make a landmark from a naked urchin urinating.
Admittedly, there's method in that madness: high-spending tourists gravitate to
it all year round.
Francesca McGeary was presenting an exhibition of prints by the celebrated
Scottish painter Elizabeth Blackadder - smashers they are, too - which The
Herald helped with some modest sponsorship. Gerry started telling us the
history of the building which is opposite a house with a plaque commemorating
another resident, the aforesaid Jean d'Ardenne, a Belgian travel writer. After
Jean d'Ardenne moved on, the street - previously called Rue d'Orlean - assumed
his name. It might have been called Hepburn Street. Audrey lived up the road,
too.
The McGearys and their daughter live at number 50 where Karl Marx was the
tenant from 1846 to 1848, according to the plaque on the wall outside. Gerry's
trouble is that students keep pinching the plaques as souvenirs. The present
one is the third.
An American researcher worked out that it was probably in this flat that Marx
wrote the Communist Manifesto before taking it to Paris for publication. He was
knocked up in what is now the McGeary home one morning by the Brussels secret
police - there was revolution in the air at the time - and told to get out of
town because he was persona non grata.
He had been a man-about-town whose favourite howff was the La Maison du Cygne
in Grand Place. It those days it was a working-man's pub; today it is one of
the poshest restaurants in Brussels and only for those on liberal expenses. New
Labour would approve.
Good exhibition, though. My wife decided we liked one of the pictures. I left a
wiser man, and poorer. But spiritually enriched.

THE scale of the Big Red Barn is made human by the installation of a central
stage. Above it, video screens supply a succession of introductory images: Rod
punting footballs into an open goal; Rod making amusingly heavy weather out of
changing his infant son's nappy. These pretty well sum up the relationship
between artiste and audience. Thousands of guys and gals have come here to
relive their emotional infancy and a time when more people had work to do and a
reason to believe.
The set lasts for about two-and-a-quarter hours and is mostly chronological.
This entails clumsy narrative, the likes of ``and so we come to 1975 and the
Atlantic Crossing album, when unfortunately I had to leave the UK''.
Unfortunately, Atlantic Crossing comes all too soon, recalling Britt,
superstardom, and the beginning of a tide of mid-Atlantic sludge (Sailing) and
a descending succession of relentless and mostly soulless hits, which are
neither rock nor pop.
To take his mind off this, Rod maintains a cracking pace, kicking footballs,
whirling microphone stands, running circuits of the stage for Young Hearts Run
Free . . .
But the early stuff is still so good. We even hear something from his days with
the Jeff Beck Group, an angry crunching metallic blues which confounds the
dancers now as it did back in '67. Gasoline Alley: what a gem. This show is a
triumph of physical and vocal endurance - and also of laddish charm. But the
later material lets the man down, dislocated in style and strangely
self-important. Good humoured yes, but there's a difference between having a
laugh and having a sense of humour.

Forget the perfume and whisky.
Clare Henry recommends a visit to the galleries for original festive gifts
CHRISTMAS looms. Gifts? Buy art. That's my advice. It's excellent value - and
lasts much longer than perfume, whisky or clothes! Christmas exhibitions are
ideal for shoppers: a treasure trove of hundreds of smallish pictures spiced
with ceramics, prints, and jewellery at bargain prices.
Bearing in mind the astronomic cost of art materials and framing - plus the 40%
to the gallery - artists practically give their stuff away. And compared to
crowded department stores, calm, spacious galleries are a breeze.
However, this week my sympathies are divided. The postal strike hit Christmas
shows hard. Mailing an average 1500 people (printed invitations plus postage),
costs galleries between #900-#2000, or up to #20,000 annually. Edinburgh's
Scottish Gallery told me it costs them #12 per person a year to keep someone on
their mailing list. A disastrous waste of money if invitations are delayed by a
postal strike.
Yet artists, notoriously bad with deadlines, make Christmas shows a nightmare.
Glasgow Print Studio's opening was marred by lack of prices and lists. Sales
were lost. The fault may lie somewhere between late delivery by artists and
short staffing, but there is no excuse for such unprofessionalism on both
sides. Todd Garner went one better. He had no prices at all at his Contemporary
Ceramics Christmas show.
Happily the granddaddy of them all, Compass Christmas Show, gets it right. For
26 years Cyril and Jill Gerber have scoured art schools and studios for a
tip-top festive collection. Jill designed the Compass logo in 1970 at art
school and shares her father's commitment to keeping the Compass going, despite
a complete cut of Arts Council funding in 1989.
``#25,000 was a lot to lose at a stroke - but we have survived so far.
Christmas is our busiest time. We depend on December sales to help us through
the year,'' says Gerber. How to choose? ``Select what you like. If they don't
like it, at least they'll remember you!''
Over 600 works are crammed into 178 West Regent Street. Artists range from
Picasso, Matisse, Hockney, Freud, Nicholson, Sutherland, Jessie King, and Henry
Moore - who merely feature alphabetically on the printed list (prices vary from
Sutherland's #1400 to Matisse's exquisite #9500 Jeune Femme which I'll buy if I
win the Lottery) - via Blackadder, Cairns, Knox, and Macpherson to new
graduates whose work costs as little as #30.
Bargains abound: jewellery by Dundee's Graeme McColm at #65; delightful
drawings by Bowman and Sue Gerber (#75); fine Shellduck by Jones (#110) and
Mare by Judith Spence (#97), witty #85 linocuts by the virtuoso Robertson;
Bennett's Dancing Horse embroidery (#70); Nardini's acrylic of Tina (#102) or
Michael Fullerton's oil study of a pensive boy (#135).
For serious stuff, look at Lesley Banks's Nanzie, Howard's yellow Reliquary,
Gilbert's charcoal of Ruth, Edgar's Landfall or Gregor Smith's Summmer Squall -
all around #400. Don't miss Scott's superb Garden Orator discoursing on ``Neil
Gunn, the war, poets, birds, sun and love'', Flockart's surreal Banquet,
Cunningham's mad ceramics, Fraser's dogs or Jim Tweedie's bandstand in
Kelvingrove Park.
Tweedie first helped out at Compass in 1971 and has worked there on and off
since the mid-1980s. Like many gallery assistants he's also an artist. A
passion for de Chirico informs his oils, giving his Glasgow cityscapes a fourth
dimension.
Another artist/assistant is Lynn Park at Glasgow's Billcliffe Fine Art. A
jeweller herself, she's made a big impact, selecting elegant silver from
Crimmins, Cherry and Molly Bullick (whose wearable silver also features at the
Scottish Gallery). Park's own brooches and earrings start at #25.
Back at Glasgow Print Studio, the shop sells works at #100 and under. Check out
Korusiewicz's classics, McCormick's New Born, Crum-Ewing's scenarios, Magee's
silhouettes, Pollok's cats, Campbell's clocks - and Chmutin's superb tiny
mezzotints, a mere #70 for something notable created in New York, Glasgow, and
St Petersburg.
Over the road (up to #400), my favourites include Snyder and Ironsides's
colourful monoprints, Malkowska's vigorous woodcuts, Howson's kids, Rae's
windows, Giblin's Arcadia, Robertson's amazing Kingdom of Scotland, and
Simpson's crazy collages.
I also recommend Edinburgh's Open Eye. David Donaldson's Flight into Egypt
features on their invitations, always among the most attractive and best
produced. Incidentally, why is it that artists take out-of-focus photos of
their work, have no idea of what makes a good image, and can rarely supply a
decent slide or black-and-white? Opening a new gallery is always a brave move;
doing it twice requires total commitment. Rena Hunter has just launched her
second effort, the Carthcart Gallery at Clarkson Road in time for Christmas,
with pictures by Orr, Turnbull, Moore, Edgar, Patullo, and Ed Hunter.
For the NS Gallery Cresswell Lane show, Stars and Trees and Fairies, leave your
storybook prejudices at home. These putti, angels, and cherubs by Nagl,
Docherty, Ironside, and Wilson are full of character, with Dorrian's
beautifully drawn daughter the star.
These special pictures are juxtaposed with an Aladdin's cave of affordable
glass, ceramics, and jewellery. There's also a memorial display of flower
paintings by Rita Madhok, famous as Darlinda the astrologer. The Darlinda
Charity, for which she raised a stupendous #300,000 for renal research,
continues and is producing a Celebrity Cookery Book soon.
Another themed show, Angels, Heavenly Visitors and Divine Landscapes at
Kilbarchan's Studio Arts Gallery, encouraged Tom Shanks to turn his hand from
stormy mountains to delicate angels while Birnie shows Venetian cherubs, Carey
a dreamy mandolin player, and Snyder a bold Icarus.
For applied arts Galerie Mirages is definitely the most cosmopolitan. For over
a decade the Dhariwals have scoured the world, bringing exotic jewellery from
India, Indonesia, and Israel, glass from Egypt and Persia, textiles from
Turkey, Afghan-istan and Rajasthan, pots and carvings from Nigeria, Kenya, and
Sarawak and wacky scrap-iron sculpture from Zimbabwe. They specialise in
one-off items which I adore, like the perfect op art poetry of an Indonesian
wicker eel catcher, a Sol Le Witt pattern palm chair or Bernard Leech-like
brown rice bowl. Like the NS Gallery, open on Sundays.
Also look out for Art Exposure at 19 Parnie Street; the Tron Studio;
Edinburgh's Torrance Gallery and East Kilbride's annual drawing show. Happy
shopping.

FOR the first time this weekend, the Democrats have succeeded in getting at
Newt Gingrich's personal honesty.
The Federal Election Commission had indicted Gopac, a committee controlled by
Mr Gingrich from 1986 until early this year, for evading the law.
Gopac is a fund-raising and ginger group that devoted itself to helping
Republican candidates for local office until Mr Gingrich took over. Then he
made it into the intellectual powerhouse of the coming Republican conquest of
the House of Representatives, with a mission to raise funds and to train
Republican candidates.
Unfortunately for him, he neglected to inform the FCC of Gopac's new mission,
which was therefore illegal. In 1991, Democrats complained to the FCC and Gopac
changed its job description, but the FCC now charges that its activities from
1989 to 1991 were illegal.
This is not an impeachable offence, and at the worst, presumably, Gopac will be
fined a sum it can easily afford. However the taint of illegality has now been
attached to the Speaker on three separate issues.
The others were, first, his acceptance of a #3m book advance from Rupert
Murdoch's book-publishing company, HarperCollins.
Mr Gingrich admitted that the deal had at least the appearance of impropriety
and renounced the advance.
He wrote the book and counted of royalties for profit, but the book has sold
far less well than he hoped and he will earn much less than #3m.
This is rather the point his critics made, insinuating that Mr Murdoch was
buying influence with the Speaker, and the Speaker was selling it. Mr
Gingrich's extreme rancour against the press is partly because of the fact that
all the publicity the newspapers gave to the book deal in December last year
has led to losing him a great deal of money.
The third ethical problem also concerned Gopac. It turned out that the
committee was paying Mr Gingrich to give lectures at a small university in
Georgia. He says that this was all a matter of teaching history, but the
Democrats claim that it was a covert way of subsidising his congressional
salary.
The Democratic Whip in the House, David Bonnior, a relentless critic of the
Speaker's, says that the FCC indictment is the ``smoking gun'' that proves Mr
Gingrich's criminality. The Speaker says the whole issue is phoney. No doubt
the truth will be found to lie in-between, but the dispute is bound to hurt the
Speaker.
Gopac is a cute acronym: the Republican Party likes to be known as the Grand
Old Party (GOP) and most of the covert funding of American politics is done
through Political Action Committees (PACs). Hence Gopac.
The FCC has released thousands of pages of memos and letters from Gopac's
files, showing how thoroughly and systematically Mr Gingrich and his friends
planned to take over the party and then to win control of Congress. Whatever
the legality of the operation, the papers the FCC has issued make fascinating
reading.
For the first time, they reveal a real political campaign in action.
One of the revelations, for instance, is that from the start, Mr Gingrich and
his friends concentrated on strategy, not substance. They intended to proclaim
themselves conservatives, and then use private polls and ``focus groups'' to
discover what that meant, and to tailor their programme to the findings.

<HEADLINE>Law failing workers, says TUC</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE legal system is failing many workers because it is ``slow, costly and
complicated'', the TUC says in a report published today.
Workers would have more chance of getting legal redress in workplace disputes
if unions were given a more important role, it says.
The TUC says union involvement should be extended from the traditional areas of
occupational injury and ill health, discrimination and employment rights. TUC
general secretary John Monks said: ``The present legal system fails too many
people.
``Trade unions have expertise in dealing with workplace issues and should be
given a greater role. We believe that unions can do a lot to help non-union
members too.''
The report says the costs and complications involved in taking a grievance to
court were often prohibitive for all but the rich or those who qualified for
legal aid.
The TUC call for the legal system to be restructured and for more disputes to
be settled out of court.
Legal aid should be made available for representation at industrial tribunals,
says the report, Justice For Working People, which was published in advance of
a TUC conference on discrimination law in London today.

<HEADLINE>Tutu demands Nigeria sanctions</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975061250</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ARCHBISHOP Desmond Tutu yesterday urged sanctions against Nigeria in the wake
of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa.
Speaking in London before the official memorial tribute to the writer and human
rights campaigner, hanged with eight other Ogoni activists last month,
Archbishop Tutu called for an oil embargo against Nigeria and for the accounts
of the military rulers to be closed.
``Apartheid was brought to its knees by the support for sanctions,'' he said,
``therefore we would call on the international community to continue that good
work.''
The Nobel Prize winner also gave support to an international boycott of Shell
Oil if the company refused to bring pressure on General Sani Abacha's
government by pulling out of gas projects there.
Archbishop Tutu, a close friend of Nelson Mandela, said the South African
president's initial ``softly softly'' approach towards Nigeria was hardening.
``He has got the bit between his teeth,'' he said.
And he was hopeful that the British government would eventually impose
sanctions. He said: ``I hope that Mr Major will take a moral stand.''
He was supported by former peace envoy Terry Waite, who said he had seen the
efficacy of sanctions in South Africa and insisted ordinary people would be
behind them.
Mr Waite also spoke movingly about the fate of Mr Saro-Wiwa. ``I myself have
lived under a death sentence and I know there are many people in Nigeria now
who are living under that threat,'' he said.
Mr Saro-Wiwa's brother, Dr Owen Wiwa, 39, who demonstrated last week outside
Shell's London offices, also spoke at the memorial performance at the Theatre
Royal, Haymarket.
He and his wife, Diane, 23, who escaped from Nigeria 10 days ago, spoke of the
``insensitivity'' of Shell and the worsening conditions for the Ogoni people.
